Transferable resistance to cefotaxime was demonstrated in 21 nosocomial strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli subsequently isolated from patients in two large University clinics. Using the double-disk diffusion test, we could detect, in each such strain, as well as in E. coli 3110 K-12 transconjugants after the transfer, the production of an Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL). Ceftibuten was demonstrated to be effective against the majority of strains studied.
