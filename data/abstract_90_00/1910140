197 strains of enterococcus and group D Streptococcus were isolated from human material at Charles Nicolle Hospital (Tunis) and identified by biochemical tests: 174, Enterococcus faecalis, 6 Enterococcus faecium, 2 Enterococcus durans and 15 Streptococcus bovis. The sensitivity to antibiotics was studied: all Enterococcus faecium were resistant at least to one antibiotic, 15% of Enterococcus faecalis were sensitive for all antibiotics tested the other species were frequently sensitive. High level resistance to aminoglycosides were frequent in Enterococcus faecalis 40%: among these strains high level resistance to gentamicin accounts for 12% and 18 frequently associated with resistance to kanamycin and streptomycin, this situation present therapeutic problems in case of severe infection.
