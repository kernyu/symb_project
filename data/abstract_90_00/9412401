Preliminary estimation of virulence in some antibiotic resistant mutants of Legionella pneumophila, Philadelphia 1 in various models of infection revealed its decrease in the mutants resistant to azlocillin, cefotaxime, fluoroquinolone LIB-80, neamine and streptomycin. Detailed investigation of the neamine resistant mutants showed that in relation to streptomycin susceptibility such mutants could be divided into 3 classes: susceptible to streptomycin, resistant to high concentrations of streptomycin and resistant to moderate concentrations of streptomycin. Part of mutants Nea(r)Strr and Nea(r)Strr500 and all mutants Nea(r)Strr100 proved to be less virulent with respect to guinea pigs and chick embryos. The study of the spectinomycin resistant mutants of Legionella spp. did not reveal any changes in the virulence which made it possible to suggest that the influence of the mutations in the ribosomal protein genes determining resistance to streptomycin and neamine on virulence of L. pneumophila was based on the interdependence of the mutant effect on the suppression and the influence on the virulence detected by us in S. flexneri, Y. pseudotuberculosis, L. monocytogenes and F. tularensis. The Legionella mutants Nea(r)Strr100 were characterized by significant protective activity and protected immunized guinea pigs when tested in a model of their aerogenic infection.
