In this study, the in vitro activity of aztreonam was compared with that of cefoperazone and ceftriaxone against 1000 gram-negative bacilli. Among gram-negative bacteria, resistance to aztreonam, cefoperazone and ceftriaxone were noted 2.7%, 11.3%, 11.5% respectively. The results obtained in this study indicate that aztreonam is highly effective against gram-negative bacilli.
