The results of recent studies suggest that uremic patients with large parathyroid hyperplasia are often resistant to active vitamin D3 therapy. Percutaneous ethanol injection has become an interesting option in such cases, although there are only a few publications on that subject. In this work we would like to present our experience with this method. 20 patients with serum iPTH > 400 pg/ml and 1-4 hyperplastic parathyroids (mean volume 1.07) underwent 56 percutaneous ethanol injection sessions under ultrasonographic guidance. In 9 patients a marked (> 75%), long-term (12-24 months) decrease in serum iPTH was achieved; lesser (> 50%) reduction in parathyroid activity persisted for 36-42 months in 5 out of 9 patients observed in this period. In almost every patient a significant reduction of alphacalcidol dose was possible. Our data confirm that percutaneous ethanol injection therapy is a useful and safe adjunct in severe uremic hyperparathyroidism treatment strategy which allows to restore the responsiveness to active vitamin D3 metabolites.
