A mouse model of localized candidosis in air-filled subcutaneous cysts imitating thrush has been developed. We have now tested various antifungal combinations in this animal model. Flucytosine (5-FC) + amphotericin B (Amph B) showed the highest efficacy, a clear additive or even synergistic effect was seen. The combination of 5-FC + imidazole or triazole derivative was less efficacious, an additive effect was rare. The combination of 5-FC + Amph B was also tested against Candida albicans strains showing various degrees of 5-FC-resistance. A significant reduction in 5-FC-resistant mutants was seen after the treatment with the combination.
