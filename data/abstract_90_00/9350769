Two isolates of Enterococcus faecium with VanA glycopeptide resistance were isolated during a hospital outbreak of E. faecium with plasmid-mediated VanB resistance. Both were found to be identical to the VanB outbreak strain by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The genotype of this strain changed from vanB to vanA through an intermediate isolate that contained both the vanA and vanB gene clusters on distinct plasmids.
