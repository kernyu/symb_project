A plasmid-encoded extended-spectrum TEM beta-lactamase with a pI of 5.5 was detected in a Capnocytophaga ochracea clinical isolate. The bla gene was associated with a strong TEM-2 promoter and was derived from bla(TEM-1a) with a single-amino-acid substitution: Glu(104)-->Lys, previously assigned to TEM-17, which is thus the first TEM beta-lactamase to be reported in the phylum Flavobacter-Bacteroides.
