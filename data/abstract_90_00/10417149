Immunization with a plasmid DNA containing the gene encoding the catalytic domain of trans-sialidase (TS) elicits protective immune responses against experimental Trypanosoma cruzi infection. As several studies provided strong evidence that during infection CD4 Th1 and CD8 T cytotoxic type 1 (Tc1) cells are important factors in host resistance, the present study was designed to evaluate which T-cell types were activated in DNA-vaccinated BALB/c mice. We found that bulk cells from DNA-immunized mice had CD4 and CD8 T cells that produced gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) but not interleukin-4 (IL-4) or IL-10. To characterize the TS-specific T cells at the clonal level, we generated CD4 and CD8 clones. We obtained cytotoxic CD4 clones of the Th1 type that secreted large amounts of IFN-gamma but not IL-4 or IL-10. Unexpectedly, we obtained other CD4 clones with a Th2 phenotype, secreting IL-4 and IL-10 but not IFN-gamma. All CD8 clones were cytotoxic and produced IFN-gamma. IL-4 and IL-10 were not secreted by these cells. Using synthetic peptides, we determined a CD8 epitope recognized by several clones as being represented by amino acids IYNVGQVSI. The antiparasitic activity of a CD4 Th1 and a CD8 Tc1 clone was assessed in vitro. CD4 or CD8 T cells significantly inhibited T. cruzi development in infected macrophages or fibroblasts, respectively. We concluded that DNA vaccine efficiently generates potentially protective CD4 Th1 and CD8 Tc1 cells specific for a T. cruzi antigen, therefore reinforcing the possibility of using this strategy for developing a preventive or therapeutic vaccine against Chagas' disease.
