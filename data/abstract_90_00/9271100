The murine Nramp1 (natural-resistance-associated macrophage protein) locus, formerly known as Ity/Lsh/Bcg, was isolated previously on the basis of chromosomal location, and as conferring natural resistance to infection against intracellular macrophage pathogens. The gene encodes a transporter molecule of unknown function. We have prepared polyclonal antisera against the C-terminal 35 amino acids of murine Nramp1. This serum is reactive towards a 65 kDa protein, expressed in murine macrophage cells from resistant or susceptible mice stimulated with interferon-gamma and lipopolysaccharide, but not in non-macrophage cells. Evidence indicates that Nramp1 is localized in a subcellular membrane rather than at the cell surface. This evidence includes: the identification of conserved endocytic targeting motifs following inspection of human and murine Nramp sequences; the enrichment of Nramp1, following magnetic selection of phagolysosomal vesicles from activated macrophages that were allowed to phagocytose magnetic, IgG-coated beads; confocal microscopy. These studies place Nramp1 on a membrane in close proximity to obligate intracellular pathogens. A link between Nramp1 and divalent-cation transport is suggested by sequence similarity with yeast SMF1. Evidence showing modulation of Nramp1 protein levels by iron chelation provides a direct link with Nramp1 function and divalent-cation metabolism.
