DNA hybridization data and aminoglycoside resistance profiles (AGRPs) were determined for 4,088 clinical isolates from three studies (United States, Belgium, and Argentina). The correlation between susceptibility profiles and hybridization results was determined with nine DNA probes. For each of the seven aminoglycoside resistance profiles which we were able to test, the data suggested at least two distinct genes could encode enzymes which lead to identical resistance profiles. Furthermore, the DNA hybridization data showed that individual strains carried up to six unique aminoglycoside resistance genes. DNA hybridization revealed interesting differences in the frequencies of these genes by organism and by country.
