This study was undertaken to establish whether anthelmintic resistance was present in nematode parasites of horses in Denmark. Sixteen horse farms were selected for faecal egg count reduction (FECR) tests to measure the efficacy of the anthelmintic used. Resistance to benzimidazole anthelmintics was found on 13 of the 16 farms, with FECR values ranging from 80.0% to -101.3%. On the remaining 3 farms FECR was 100.0%, 99.3% and 97.2%. Results of a questionnaire study on anthelmintic usage, parasite control measures and management practices showed that horses in this study were treated on average 7.1 times/year. Horse owners changed between preparations of drugs but almost only within the same class of anthelmintics. Nine owners gave an anthelmintic treatment to purchased horses before they were introduced on the farm. On 14 farms, the same paddock was grazed every year and the average stocking rate was estimated to be 2.4 horses/ha. Strategies to avoid development of anthelmintic resistance are discussed and recommendations of parasite control on horse farms are presented.
