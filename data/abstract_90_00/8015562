The floors of indoor swimming pools are contaminated by yeasts, dermatophytes and other saprophytic species. Previous epidemiological studies have revealed that the fungi persist even after cleaning. Three disinfectants were tested in vitro against fungi standard isolated from swimming pool floors. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) tests and AFNOR standard T72-201 were carried out. Adilon and Decalcite, commonly used in swimming pools, were ineffective against most of the fungi, while Nobactel, recommended elsewhere, was particularly effective against the studied fungi. In addition to the necessary technical modifications of the methods, this study highlights the need to choose effective antifungal compounds and to alternate cleaning products to minimize acquired resistance.
