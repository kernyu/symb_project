A 5.1-kb plasmid, designated pSCS12, isolated from a naturally occurring Staphylococcus sciuri conferred resistance to chloramphenicol (CmR) and streptomycin (SmR). Restriction endonuclease analyses of pSCS12 revealed partial structural homologies to the CmR-plasmids pC221 from S. aureus and pSCS1 from S. intermedius, to the SmR-plasmids pSAI-1 from S. hyicus and pS194 from S. aureus, as well as to the CmR/SmR plasmid pSK68 from S. aureus. Southern-blot hybridization with specific CmR- and SmR-gene probes confirmed these similarities and allowed the mapping of the CmR- and SmR-determinants in the S. sciuri plasmid pSCS12. These observations lead to the suggestion that CmR/SmR-plasmids, such as pSCS12, may have evolved from CmR- and SmR-plasmids by interplasmidic recombination.
