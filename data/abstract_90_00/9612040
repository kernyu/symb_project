Acilact, a bacterial biopreparation representing a complex of live lyophilized acidophilic lactobacteria, was used in combined therapy of 45 patients with periodontitis of mild and medium severity. The drag was applied locally and per os. Clinical parameters improved after therapy; gram-positive cocci and bacilli predominated in local microflora; natural antibacterial resistance of the body improved. This method of therapy is new in principle and pathogenetically grounded. It results in correction of autoflora of the oral cavity and periodontal pouches, and, possibly, of the gastrointestinal tract. Acilact is well tolerated by the patients and induces no side effects, there are no contraindications against its administration.
