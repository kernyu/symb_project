Panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP), a mixture of a newly synthesized carbapenem antibiotic panipenem (PAPM) and N-benzoyl-beta-alanine, betamipron (BP), was evaluated for pharmacokinetics, in vivo and in vitro antimicrobial effect, and clinical efficacy in pediatric patients. Intravenous drip infusion of either 10 mg/10 mg/kg or 20 mg/20 mg/kg of PAPM/BP for 30 minutes resulted in maximum plasma concentrations of 36.6 micrograms/ml and 92.5 micrograms/ml, half lives (T 1/2 beta) of 1.17 hours and 0.88 hours, and urinary excretion until 6 hours of 29% and 17.7%, respectively. Antibacterial activities of PAPM against Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative rods isolated from pediatric patients were equal to or slightly stronger than those of imipenem, ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and piperacillin. Clinical effects of PAPM/BP evaluated in 17 patients were as follows; excellent in 8 cases, good in 8 cases, and fair in 1 case. The overall efficacy rate was 94.1%. Elevations of GOT and/or GPT were observed in 2 patients and transient eosinophilia was observed in 1 patient.
