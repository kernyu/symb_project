Treatment of HIV disease with antiretroviral agents has changed considerably. We now know that monotherapy is not the best strategy in most cases to combat rapid turnover of virus and development of resistance (the exception being mother-to-child transmission) and various combination drug regimens are being explored. Apart from the main drug groups, consisting of nucleoside analogues, proteinase inhibitors, and reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, many new compounds are under development. The timing of therapy may likewise be important, and the indications of benefit from early initiation of treatment need to be confirmed in randomised trials. Overall, there is far more optimism about the use of drugs in HIV infection than there was several years ago.
