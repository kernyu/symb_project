The activity of 12 antibiotics, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefotiam, ceftizoxime, latamoxef, ceftazidime, cefuzonam, amikacin, ofloxacin, imipenem, aztreonam and minocycline, against 120 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was examined. In addition, the efficacy of antibiotics against single-, double-, or triple-drug-resistant isolates of P. aeruginosa were also examined to determine the cross-resistance to each drug. There was cross-resistance between piperacillin, ceftazidime and aztreonam, but amikacin and imipenem remained effective antibiotics, especially as salvage therapy, against isolates resistant to one agent. Results also suggested that piperacillin, ceftazidime or imipenem in combination with amikacin are effective combination regimens against most clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa. Amikacin and imipenem were also suitable antibiotics, especially as salvage therapy, against isolates of P. aeruginosa resistant to two agents. In conclusion, the results provide useful guidelines for choosing an effective treatment against clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa, and for choosing salvage therapy against resistant P. aeruginosa.
