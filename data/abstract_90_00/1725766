1. The effects of the inhaled neuropeptides, neurokinin A (NKA) and substance P (SP) on lung resistance (RL) and airway microvascular permeability were studied in anaesthetized guinea-pigs. 2. Single doses of inhaled NKA (3 x 10(-5), 1 x 10(-4), 3 x 10(-4) M; 45 breaths) and SP (1 x 10(-4), 3 x 10(-4), 1 x 10(-3); 45 breaths) caused a dose-dependent increase in both RL and airway microvascular leakage, assessed as extravasation of the albumin marker, Evans blue dye. 3. NKA at 1 x 10(-4) and 3 x 10(-4) M resulted in a significantly higher increase in RL than SP at the same doses. 4. Inhaled SP (3 x 10(-4) M; 45 breaths) caused significantly higher Evans blue dye extravasation in main bronchi and proximal intrapulmonary airways compared to the same dose of NKA. 5. Pretreatment with the specific inhibitor of neural endopeptidase (NEP24.11), phosphoramidon, caused an approximately 100 fold leftward shift of the RL responses to inhaled NKA and SP. 6. Phosphoramidon significantly potentiated both NKA- and SP-induced airway microvascular leakage at proximal intrapulmonary airways, but not at any other airway level. 7. Inhibition of NEP24.11 potentiate both the SP- or NKA-induced airflow obstruction to a larger extent than the induced airway microvascular leakage, suggesting that NEP24.11 is more important in the modulation of the airflow obstruction observed after these mediators.
