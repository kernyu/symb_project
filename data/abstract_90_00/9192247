Therapeutic efficacy of the combined regimen, imipenem/cilastatin (IPM/CS) plus vancomycin (VCM), was examined in a total of 13 patients infected with MRSA (10 patients with pneumonia, 2 with sepsis and 1 with urinary tract infection). Based on the results of determination of FIC indices, in vitro combined effects were synergistic in 4 strains and additive in 3 strains. There was, however, no apparent correlation between the in vitro combined effect in terms of FIC index and clinical outcome. No side effects or abnormal laboratory findings were observed. The average daily doses of IPM/CS and VCM were 1.2 g and 1.25 g and the average administration periods were 17.5 and 14.9 days, respectively. The present results suggested that simultaneous use of IPM/CS and VCM at the standard doses could yield an enhancement of both bacteriological and clinical efficacies in treatment of the patients with MRSA infection.
