We have developed a gene-cloning system in Micromonospora olivasterospora, a fortimicin A (astromicin) producer. Plasmids of Micromonospora from two strains of M. olivasterospora were used for construction of the vectors. Two antibiotic-resistance genes, nmrA and nmrB, cloned from a neomycin-producing Micromonospora, were introduced into these plasmids for the selection of transformants. In a new protoplasting protocol for lysozyme-resistant bacteria, protoplasts of M. olivasterospora were found in short-time incubation with lysozyme and transformed efficiently, indicating that the method was suitable to shotgun cloning. Using this system, seven biosynthetic genes for fortimicin A were cloned. Their physical maps revealed that at least four of these genes were clustered. Analysis of a cosmid library of M. olivasterospora showed that eleven biosynthetic genes and a self-defense gene existed in a region of approx. 25 kb of DNA.
