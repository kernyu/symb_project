In this study the in vitro susceptibility of 1,009 Gram-positive strains isolated from 4,505 positive urocultures was evaluated towards the following chemotherapeutic agents: oxacillin, ampicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, imipenem, cefalotin, cefotaxime, amikacin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, pefloxacin, clindamycin, erythromycin, vancomycin, rifampicin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol. The results indicate that vancomycin is the most active antibiotic against all the strains, including enterococci often involved in serious infections caused by invasive techniques.
