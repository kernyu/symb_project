The stability of tolerance of Staphylococcus aureus during subculturing at 37 degrees C and development of this property after repeated exposure to cloxacillin or vancomycin were investigated in vitro. Four of five tolerant strains lost this property during repeated subculturing at 37 degrees C for 50 days. Conversely, tolerance emerged in two of four nontolerant strains after repeated cycles of exposure to 25 micrograms of cloxacillin/ml or 10 micrograms of vancomycin/ml alternating with growth in antibiotic-free medium. Previous in vivo exposure to cloxacillin did not enhance the development of tolerance in vitro. MICs of both cloxacillin and vancomycin did not change significantly during this procedure. Whether the conversion of nontolerant strains to the tolerant state can also occur during antibiotic exposure in treatment of patients remains to be determined.
