A human isolate of Salmonella typhimurium was found to be highly resistant to several antibiotics including quinolones (MIC of ciprofloxacin 16 mg/l). Killing by ciprofloxacin was only achieved after prolonged exposure to drug concentrations above the MIC. The quinolone resistance of this particular strain was not mediated by plasmids which, however, coded for several other resistance properties.
