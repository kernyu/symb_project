The treatment of peritoneal dialysis related peritonitis has been streamlined by the recommendations of an ad hoc committee, which has advocated avoidance of vancomycin as an empirical therapy because of the prevailing problems of vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE). This report relates to the continued use of vancomycin combined with netilmicin in our programme as empiric therapy for CAPD peritonitis and reports on favorable results of over 80% cure rate using this regimen. The need for change to vancomycin avoiding regimes has to be related to the knowledge of local prevalence of VRE and staphylococcal sensitivity patterns.
