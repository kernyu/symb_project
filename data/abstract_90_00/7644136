Ethanol has a concentration dependent dual effect on electrical activity of rat CA1 hippocampal neurons. Low concentrations of ethanol (0.001%) enhance whereas high concentrations (0.5%) suppress synaptic transmission. Ethanol has no effect on cell input resistance and orthodromic or somatic threshold of action potentials. Cholera toxin, an activator of stimulatory guanine nucleotide binding regulatory protein (Gs), prevented the ethanol effects on field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). Staurosporine, an inhibitor of protein kinases, bisindolylmaleimide, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, and phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), an activator of protein kinase C, blocked the effect of ethanol on field EPSPs. Our results show that ethanol at extremely low concentrations is able to affect synaptic transmission and suggest that the molecular mechanism of ethanol action involves the activation of Gs protein and protein kinase C.
