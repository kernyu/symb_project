Prostaglandin H synthase isoforms 1 and 2 (PGHS-1 and -2) each have a peroxidase activity and also a cyclooxygenase activity that requires initiation by hydroperoxide. The hydroperoxide initiator requirement for PGHS-2 cyclooxygenase is about 10-fold lower than for PGHS-1 cyclooxygenase, and this difference may contribute to the distinct control of cellular prostanoid synthesis by the two isoforms. We compared the kinetics of the initial peroxidase steps in PGHS-1 and -2 to quantify mechanistic differences between the isoforms that might contribute to the difference in cyclooxygenase initiation efficiency. The kinetics of formation of Intermediate I (an Fe(IV) species with a porphyrin free radical) and Intermediate II (an Fe(IV) species with a tyrosyl free radical, thought to be the crucial oxidant in cyclooxygenase catalysis) were monitored at 4 degrees c by stopped flow spectrophotometry with several hydroperoxides as substrate. With 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid, the rate constant for Intermediate I formation (k1) was 2.3 x 10(7) M-1 s-1 for PGHS-1 and 2.5 x 10(7) M-1 s-1 for PGHS-2, indicating that the isoforms have similar initial reactivity with this lipid hydroperoxide. For PGHS-1, the rate of conversion of Intermediate I to Intermediate II (k2) became the limiting factor when the hydroperoxide level was increased, indicating a rate constant of 10(2)-10(3) s-1 for the generation of the active cyclooxygenase species. For PGHS-2, however, the transition between Intermediates I and II was not rate-limiting even at the highest hydroperoxide concentrations tested, indicating that the k2 value for PGHS-2 was much greater than that for PGHS-1. Computer modelling predicted that faster formation of the active cyclooxygenase species (Intermediate II) or increased stability of the active species increases the resistance of the cyclooxygenase to inhibition by the intracellular hydroperoxide scavenger, glutathione peroxidase. Kinetic differences between the PGHS isoforms in forming or stabilizing the active cyclooxygenase species can thus contribute to the difference in the regulation of their cellular activities.
