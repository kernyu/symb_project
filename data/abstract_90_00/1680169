The effect of Myrj 59 (a polyoxyethyleneglycol derivative of stearic acid) on amphotericin B (Am B) solubility, toxicity and activity has been investigated. We showed that Myrj 59 could solubilize the antibiotic. Moreover, it also decreased and abolished the haemolytic activity of the drug by increasing the resistance of the red blood cells and impairing the interaction of Am B with the cellular membrane cholesterol, but it did not modify the in-vitro antifungal activity of the drug. On the other hand, Myrj 59 did not decrease the acute in-vivo toxicity of the drug (LD50 and nephrotoxicity). In a previous study we have shown that a polyoxyethleneglycol derivative of cholesterol could solubilize Am B and was able to decrease the in-vitro and in-vivo toxicity of the antibiotic without altering its in-vitro antifungal activity. The results of the present study suggest that the cholesterol moiety of the surfactant is not necessary to decrease the in-vitro lytic activity of the drug but could play a role in the reduction of the in-vivo toxicity.
