The species of an Alcaligenes bacterial strain may be difficult to determine on the basis of conventional phenotype features. Esterase pattern analysis using acrylamide-agar gel electrophoresis and determination of the antimicrobial resistance profile (agar diffusion method) were performed for A. faecalis (34 strains). A. denitrificans subsp xylosoxydans (16 strains) and A. piechaudi (5 strains). The Cistat program (D2 Software) was used for statistical representation of results. The homogeneous, species-specific esterase patterns ensured correct assignment of each strain to one of the three species. Antimicrobial susceptibility was greatest for A. faecalis which was susceptible to both cephalosporins of all generations and aminoglycosides. A. xylosoxydans was the species with the greatest resistance to antimicrobials. A. piechaudii exhibited intermediate susceptibility.
