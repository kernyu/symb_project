The paper gives the results of experimental studies of the elastic-strength and functional characteristics of xenotissue samples (the pericardium of the calf, pig and Glisson's capsule) stabilized with glutaric aldehyde and polyepoxy compounds. The paper discusses various treatments of biological materials (including Glisson's capsule) anticalcified with additives (sodium dodecyl sulfate, complexes of copper and zinc) and shows that their use improves proteolytic and calcinotic resistance without deteriorating the mechanical parameters of xenotissues. Comparative analysis of the physical-mechanic and functional characteristics of xenotissues treated in different ways allows one to make anticalcifying treatment of biological tissues with copper and zinc complexes physical-mechanic and functional characteristics of xenotissues (Glisson's capsule) for clinical application.
