The new cell variants were selected in vitro from the low-malignant Syrian hamster embryo cells (STHE strain) spontaneously transformed in vitro. Ten cycles of in vitro co-cultivation of the parental STHE cells with the normal Syrian hamsters peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) (resident and LPS-activated PEC) used as a selecting agents (PERr, PECa) were performed. The susceptibilities of thus selected STHE cell variants as well as parental STHE cells to macrophage cytotoxicity and H2O2 dagame were tested with 3H-TdR assays. It has been demonstrated that all five STHE cell variants selected in vitro with PECa, in contrast to the parental STHE cells and three STHE cell variants selected with the use of PECr, were significantly more resistant to H2O2-mediated cytotoxicity. The increased resistance was acquired already after the 1-st cycle of the selection procedure. In contrast, only one STHE cell variant selected with PECr appeared to be semiresistant (demonstrated in 4 out of 6 experiments) to H2O2 damage after 10th cycle of in vitro co-cultivation.
