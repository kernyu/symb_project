An epidemiological analysis of 100 cases of indeterminate leprosy attending the Department of Dermatology and Venereology of Medical College Hospital, Trivandrum, is presented. It was found that indeterminate leprosy formed 13.23% of all cases of leprosy and 1.3% of all out-patients attending this department. Only 27% of patients with indeterminate leprosy were below 15 years of age. There was a predominance of males especially over 20 years of age. There was no history of contact with leprosy in any of the patients with indeterminate leprosy. All patients with indeterminate leprosy came for hypopigmented patches, suspecting leprosy. Majority had the disease for more than 6 months. Single lesion on the outer aspect of extremity was the most common presentation. The lepromin test was positive in only 2% of patients with indeterminate leprosy, while it was positive in 80% of control subjects. Three cases of dapsone resistance were suspected in this series. The epidemiological significance of the findings is discussed.
