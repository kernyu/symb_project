The survey of the primary resistances of tuberculosis bacilli to drugs is not only important epidemiologically speaking, but also for its use as a guideline to defining programs, to assessing the quality and the practical development of chemotherapy in a country, to measuring the propensity of the resisting tuberculosis bacilli to infect a given population within some time and to taking the necessary remedial measures. The object of this study has been to compare the rate of initial drugs' resistances of tuberculosis bacilli in Mali between 1980-1982 and 1989-1990. The results, which show a fall in the primary resistances due to drugs and to the combination of antibiotics as well, are being discussed while taking account various factors related to the organization.
