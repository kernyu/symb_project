A composite mammalian cell-E. coli shuttle vector was developed based on the human papova virus BK and pSV-neo. The vector contains a dioxin-responsive enhancer (DRE) controlling a mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter for the inducible expression of inserted genes. In human cells the vector replicates episomally, presumably utilizing the BKV rather than the SV40 origin, and expresses the BK T/t antigens. A deletion in the late BK region precludes the expression of the core/capsid proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3, thereby preventing the infectious lytic cycle. HeLa cells which were transfected with this vector and selected for resistance to the antibiotic G418 maintained the construct primarily in episomal form during more than one year of continuous culture, with little or no integration into the host genome. Transformed cells cultured in higher concentrations of G418 contained higher copy numbers of the vector. This permits one to vary the dosage of an inserted gene easily and reversibly without the need of conventional amplification techniques and clonal analysis. Using a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter gene inserted downstream of the MMTV promoter, we found that CAT expression was greater in clones with higher vector copy number. CAT expression was inducible with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, but inducibility was found to be inversely proportional to the copy number. Transformation of bacteria with plasmid molecules retrieved from the mammalian host was efficient, making this vector well adapted for the screening of cDNA libraries for the ability to express a phenotype in mammalian cells. Moreover, DNA sequences were stable during long-term passage in mammalian cells; vector passaged continuously for more than one year retained fully functional bacterial genes for resistance to chloramphenicol and ampicillin.
