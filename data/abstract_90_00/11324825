The evolution of HIV-1 viral populations was studied in a set of MT-2-co-cultured viruses isolated from five patients at the beginning of treatment with zidovudine and after 11-36 months of drug therapy. We first characterized the HIV-1 pol gene to detect the zidovudine-resistance mutations at codons 215 and 219. To analyse the effect that the selective pressure of zidovudine on pol exerted on other genomic regions, we also studied the env gene. The env gene sequence of virus isolated from one individual was unchanged, whereas three other sample pairs had minor alterations in env. In one individual, we detected a significant change in the env gene sequence, and so performed a clonal analysis on viruses isolated before and after treatment. In this individual, the zidovudine-resistant variant that became predominant in the resistant virus population was an undetected minority variant of the viral population before treatment was initiated. These results indicate that the evolution of quasispecies produced by selective pressure on the pol gene from zidovudine treatment could select, in a random process, important changes in other genomic regions; in particular, we describe alterations in the env gene.
