In vitro activity of commonly used antimicrobial agents against consecutively isolated 521 strains of Gram negative bacilli causing serious infections in the National University Hospital, Singapore were tested in parallel with cefoperazone-sulbactam combination. With the combination complete resistance of 2% and intermediate resistance of 5% were noted among the 521 strains tested. Resistance to imipenem was low (5%) but resistance against other antimicrobial agents varied from 12% (amikacin) to 80% (ampicillin). In vitro data demonstrated a possible future role for cefoperazone-sulbactam in the treatment of sepsis caused by Gram negative bacilli in our hospital.
