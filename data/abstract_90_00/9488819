This article discusses the control of nosocomial infection using strategies other than antimicrobial therapy, based on the concepts of asepsis, disinfection and isolation of infectious patients. The aim is to prevent the spread of pathogenic organisms from patient to patient. Infection control techniques are practised in parallel with direct antibiotic therapy but should reduce the overall use of antibiotics, and reduce the selection pressure for organisms to develop resistance.
