An examination of salmonella isolates collected by the Scottish Agricultural College Veterinary Services Division from April 1994 to May 1995 was conducted to determine the extent to which Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium phage type 104 (DT104) occurred and to investigate the antimicrobial resistance patterns of isolates. Typhimurium DT104 was the predominant salmonella and was isolated from nine species of animal. All isolates of this phage type possessed resistance to at least one antimicrobial and 98% of the isolates were resistant to multiple antimicrobials with R-type ACTSp the predominant resistance pattern. Various other resistance patterns were identified and transferable resistance to the veterinary aminoglycoside antimicrobial apramycin was demonstrated in three strains. A retrospective study for gentamicin resistance in isolates from the Scottish Salmonella Reference Laboratory collection revealed a human isolate of Typhimurium DT104 resistant to gentamicin but sensitive to apramycin and a bovine isolate with apramycin and gentamicin resistance.
