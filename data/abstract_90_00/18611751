A total of 182 Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi isolated from three hospitals in Hong Kong from 1986 to 1992 were tested for their susceptibility to 21 antimicrobial agents. Four percent or less were resistant to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, some of the cephalosporins, nalidixic acid, tetracycline and trimethoprim and 6% to 1024 mg/l sulfamethoxazole. All were susceptible to the aminoglycosides and the 4-quinolones. Nineteen isolates were resistant to at least 1, and up to 9, antibiotics. Of 8 chloramphenicolor multiply-resistant isolates studied, only 3 could transfer their resistances while resistance of one could only be mobilized. Four of 5 ampicillin-resistant strains produced a beta-lactamase of pI 5.5. Antibiotic resistances were mediated by plasmids of 106, 116 or 221 kb of incompatibility groups H, I1 and K. Three resistant isolates did not harbour any plasmid. A total of 43 (24%) S. Typhi harboured plasmids ranging in size from 4.3 to 221 kb. Plasmids of 106 kb and 8.5 kb were found in 17 and 10 isolates, respectively. Restriction enzyme digestion of these two plasmids showed that each could be differentiated into 3 types. Of 89 isolates that were phage typed, 38% were untypable, while 17% and 12% were of phage types E1 and A, respectively, and the rest belonged to 17 other types.
