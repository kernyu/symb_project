Four experiments, two with sheep and two with goats, were carried out to determine the efficacy of ivermectin, fenbendazole, levamisole, closantel and some of their combinations by faecal egg count reduction tests. In the first experiment, injectable ivermectin, oral ivermectin, fenbendazole and levamisole were tested in 6-month-old lambs, and their reduction percentages were 77%, 13%, 42% and 92%, respectively. In the second experiment, with yearling sheep, the reduction percentages were 35% for injectable ivermectin, 32% for fenbendazole, 99% for levamisole, 48% for closantel, 92% for injectable ivermectin combined with fenbendazole, 99% for injectable ivermectin combined with levamisole, and 100% for fenbendazole combined with levamisole. In the study with 18-month-old goats given the same dose rates as those recommended for sheep, the reduction percentages were 73% for injectable ivermectin, 25% for fenbendazole, and 78% for levamisole. Another group of 14-month-old goats was treated with dose rates 1.5 times those recommended for sheep and the reduction percentages were 93% for levamisole, 92% for injectable ivermectin, and 97% for a combination of levamisole and ivermectin. In all experiments with sheep and goats the gastrointestinal nematode parasites identified by larval cultures were Haemonchus contortus, Trichostrongylus spp. and Oesophagostomum spp. The gastrointestinal nematodes of both sheep and goats on this farm are resistant to ivermectin and fenbendazole, whereas levamisole is still effective in sheep, but not in goats. The results are discussed in relation to the farm as a source of breeding stock to smallholder farmers and its potential to spread anthelmintic resistance.
