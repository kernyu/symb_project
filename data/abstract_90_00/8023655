Scattering Vitamin C of a small dose on a bedsore, enhances remarkably bactericidal effect of antibiotics. With scattering of it, 1% cream of Sulfadiazine made antibiotics-resistant bacteria (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus = MRSA, Pseudomonas aeruginosa etc.) negative on a bedsore. Also in MRSA-infection of respiratory organs, combined administration of Vitamin C gives more effective bactericidal efficacy to some antibiotics. In a case infected with MRSA, of which the Minocycline-therapy had been ineffective, the combined administration of Vitamin C with Minocycline led him successfully to the negativeness of MRSA.
