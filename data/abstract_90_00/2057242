The effect of type I interferon (IF) on the course of endotoxic shock was studied by morphological methods. It was found that preliminary (24 hours earlier) injection of preparations of homologous IF (10(3) ME) to ABLb/c and CC57 W mice sensitive to salmonella infection prevented the death of 90% of animals from a lethal toxic dose of the endotoxin or killed salmonellae. Preliminary injection of IF reduced sharply the intensity of morphological changes during all periods of the study. IF mitigates the toxic effect exerted on the cell and tissue structure both by increasing the functional activity of phagocytes, facilitating in this way elimination of the endotoxin from the body, and by increasing cell resistance to the direct effect of the bacterial toxin, which is just what determines its protective antitoxic effect. It was established that IF prevents the development of the most grave changes--thrombosis of the microcirculatory bed of vitally important organs by hindering the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation of blood, which determines the severity and outcome of shock.
