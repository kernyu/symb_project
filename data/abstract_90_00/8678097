Although third-generation cephalosporins have been considered the backbone of antibiotic therapy for the treatment of many kinds of serious infections, including those in hospitalized patients, lack of activity against some important pathogens still exists among currently available drugs. In addition, increasing accounts of antibiotic resistance, particularly in the hospital environment, are of deep concern and have thus led to the need for the development of newer antimicrobial agents. Cefepime is a now parenteral cephalosporin with an extended spectrum of antibacterial activity that includes both aerobic gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. It is also active against many gram-negative organisms resistant to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime, as well as many strains of Enterobacter and Citrobacter resistant to ceftazidime. Cefepime appears to be less likely to select out resistant organisms, and it may be less likely to change hospital flora than currently available antimicrobials. Cefepime has been shown to be very well tolerated and effective in the treatment of a variety of infections including moderate-to-severe pneumonia (including cases associated with concurrent bacteremia), complicated and uncomplicated urinary tract infections (also including cases associated with concurrent bacteremia), and skin and skin-structure infections. Clinical response rates are > or = 75% for most infections and have been comparable to ceftazidime in comparative trials. In addition, pretreatment susceptibility testing indicates that >94% of organisms isolated in patients enrolled in clinical trials were susceptible to cefepime.
