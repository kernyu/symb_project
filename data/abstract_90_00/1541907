Resistance of mice to Salmonella typhimurium in the early phase of infection is known to be controlled by the expression of chromosome 1 locus Ity. To clarify the mechanism by which the genetically resistant (Ityr) mice can overcome the first phase of salmonellosis, the early response in DBA/2 (Ityr) and BALB/c (Itys) mice was compared after a subcutaneous injection of S. typhimurium. In both strains, the growth of S. typhimurium was controlled in livers and Kupffer cells until day 3, but thereafter the bacteria multiplied rapidly in BALB/c mice. Over the first 2 days nonspecific responses (changes in levels of blood leukocytes, plasma iron, and alpha 1-antitrypsin) were not significantly different between the strains, and the capacity of Kupffer cells isolated from infected mice of both strains to produce interleukin 1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) was of the same degree. Thereafter, only DBA/2 Kupffer cells were able to produce membrane-associated IL-1 (ma IL-1) as well as TNF-alpha. Moreover, only DBA/2 splenocytes were able to produce interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) upon stimulation with Salmonella antigens, although concanavalin A-stimulated splenocytes of both strains produced the same level of interleukin 2. Furthermore, administration of recombinant murine IFN-gamma and DBA/2 Kupffer cells of day 6 to BALB/c mice 3 days after infection resulted in a significant level of protection, whereas neither of these materials alone induced protection. Injection of anti-TNF-alpha antibodies did not affect the resistance of DBA/2 mice. Thus, these findings suggest that the early resistance of Ityr mice is partly attributable to their capacity to produce IFN-gamma and ma IL-1 after infection.
