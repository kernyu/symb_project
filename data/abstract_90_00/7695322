Eighty-four children suffering from acute otitis media caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae were treated prospectively with cefuroxime axetil suspension (30 mg/kg of body weight twice daily for 8 days). The high incidence of isolates with decreased susceptibilities to penicillin (42 of 84 isolates) allowed us to establish a relationship between clinical success and the penicillin MICs for pneumococcal isolates. It was found that cefuroxime axetil is clinically effective in the treatment of acute otitis media caused by penicillin-susceptible and penicillin-intermediate strains of S. pneumoniae. The results indicate that the risk of treatment failure with cefuroxime axetil was increased in children with otitis media caused by S. pneumoniae when the penicillin MIC were greater than or equal to 2 mg/liter.
