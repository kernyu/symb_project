The in vitro activity of a new orally administered carbacephem analog of cefaclor, loracarbef (LY163892), was compared with those of cefaclor and several other oral antimicrobial agents against recent clinical isolates of Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Loracarbef was found to be slightly more active than cefaclor against H. influenzae and had activity essentially equivalent to that of cefaclor for M. catarrhalis. Resistance to loracarbef was uncommon and was noted only with rare beta-lactamase-producing strains of H. influenzae. On the basis of these observations, loracarbef may be of utility in the management of localized, non-life-threatening infections caused by H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis.
