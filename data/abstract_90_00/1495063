A gene for neomycin resistance linked to a Drosophila hsp 70 heat shock promoter was introduced into the germ line of Anopheles gambiae Giles. Effects of heat shock at 37 and 41 degrees C on the subsequent survival of the transgenic mosquito subjected to selection by the antibiotic G418 were studied. Heat shock did not enhance the survival of untransformed mosquitoes but greatly increased the survival of the transgenic mosquitoes. Survival after heat shock at 41 degrees C was greater than after heat shock at 37 degrees C.
