Protective ability against the challenge of different strains by immunization with culture filtrate (CF) obtained from Salmonella enteritidis was investigated. It was shown that the different strains of S. enteritidis can be separated into two distinct groups of protective (2547, 116M, 116-54, SR-98G, and 3775) and nonprotective strains (2822, 3975, and IID-604). Using a cell-free microbicidal system, the susceptibilities of these strains to active oxygen species was evaluated. S. enteritidis was found to be susceptible to these active oxygen species, however no differences between the protective and nonprotective strains were observed. Both catalase (H2O2 scavenger) and histidine (1O2 scavenger) inhibited the bactericidal activity of the xanthine-xanthine oxidase system. Therefore, among the various oxygen intermediates, H2O2 and 1O2 appears to be necessary for killing of S. enteritidis. In tests for the ability to trigger an oxidative burst in murine peritoneal macrophages, strain 2547 triggered O2 generation at levels as high as those observed with strain 2822. These studies indicate that the difference between the protective and nonprotective strains is not attributed to susceptibility against active oxygen species nor to the ability to trigger an oxidative burst. From these observations, it is suggested that the difference is not due to differences in resistance to the killing of different strains within macrophages.
