Ninety-four methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates (MRSA) were characterized by means of two typing methods, antibiotyping and esterase electrophoretic typing. Antibiotyping, recorded on the basis of susceptibility testing of 13 antimicrobial agents, allowed the description of 18 antibiotypes, four of which comprised 30, 14, 14 and 12 strains respectively. Esterase electrophoretic typing, based on esterase activity against seven synthetic substrates after polyacrylamide-agarose gel electrophoresis, led to the description of 12 electrophoretic types, two of which were predominant with 60 and 20 strains respectively. The combined use of both typing methods yielded 32 combinations, three of which were predominant with 21, 12 and 11 strains respectively. A good differentiation of strains was achieved, particularly when the antibiotype was correlated to the electrophoretic type. Thus, the combination of antibiotyping with esterase electrophoretic typing may be proposed as a well-suited method for the characterization of MRSA strains.
