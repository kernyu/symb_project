There is now considerable evidence that cerebral malaria may be related to the over-production of tumour necrosis factor (TNF). Nevertheless, our knowledge is very poor concerning the biological events which lead up to this TNF over-production. Furthermore, interleukin-6 (IL-6) is produced in large amounts during malaria infection and seems to have inhibitory action on TNF production. Anti-malarial drugs were investigated for their ability to interfere with TNF and IL-6 secretion by human non-immune macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or Plasmodium falciparum culture supernatant. Macrophages were pretreated with chloroquine, quinine, proguanil, mefloquine or halofantrine before stimulation. TNF and IL-6 production were suppressed in a dose-dependent manner when macrophages were treated with chloroquine, but not with other anti-malarial drugs. Considering that chloroquine probably acts via lysosomotropic mechanisms, and that iron metabolism may interfere with the non-specific immune response, we focused our attention on these biochemical events in order to investigate the mechanisms by which chloroquine inhibits cytokine production. Our results demonstrated that chloroquine-induced inhibition of TNF and IL-6 production is not mediated through a lysosomotropic mechanism, and that chloroquine probably acts on TNF secretion by disrupting iron homeostasis. Inhibition of IL-6 production seems not to be mediated through these pathways. These observations suggest that chloroquine may help to prevent cerebral malaria whatever the drug sensitivity of the parasite strain, and may provide new tools for an anti-disease therapy regardless of the emergence of parasite multi-drug resistance.
