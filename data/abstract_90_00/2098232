SEM observation was made in the experiment to analyze the ultrastructure of resinified dentin. Phenolic resin fluid permeates in to the dentinal-tubule and set in it. The permeability of this agent was also able to permeate into intercellular substance and changed the appearance of inter-weaved fibril to the condition of agent had set. According to the Fracture Mechanics, it was not beneficial to resist the fracture progress if the microspace had been fulfilled by the agent. The tensile stress of resinified dentin was 387 kg/cm2, which was 30 kg/cm2 lower than that of unresinified-dentin.
