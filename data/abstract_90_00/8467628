A total of 250 strains of enterococci isolated in Kumamoto University Hospital, Japan, during the period from January to March 1992 were tested for high-level aminoglycoside resistance. Brain-heart infusion (BHI) agar plates supplemented with 1000 micrograms/ml of gentamicin or 2000 micrograms/ml of streptomycin detected 164 (66%) isolates resistant to either gentamicin or streptomycin alone, or both, and consisted of 107 (43%) resistant to gentamicin and 96 (38%) resistant to streptomycin. The Vitek Gram-Positive Susceptibility card (GPS-TA) revealed high correlations with those by agar screens, the results indicating a sensitivity of 100% and 99% to gentamicin and streptomycin, respectively, and 100% specificity to both. Also, the microdilution tests of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) showed 100% and 92% sensitivity to gentamicin and streptomycin, respectively, and no false resistance (100% specificity) when compared with the results by agar screens.
