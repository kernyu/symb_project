Fourteen mutants of the fungus Phycomyces blakesleeanus, showing high levels of resistance to copper, were isolated. In all the mutants, copper resistance behaved as a very variable and unstable trait. In the mutant strain MU102, the mutation was demonstrated to be cytoplasmically inherited. In addition, this mutant strain differed from the wild-type in growth, respiration rate, and shape and viability of spores.
