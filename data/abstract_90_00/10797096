With the participation of eight major reference hospitals in Turkey, 749 aerobic Gram-negative isolates obtained from 473 intensive care patients in 1997 were tested for their susceptibility to 13 commonly employed antibacterial agents. The frequency with which species were isolated and resistance rates were compared with data from the previous 2 years. Imipenem was the most active agent against the majority of isolates (75%), followed by ciprofloxacin, cefepime and amikacin. The per cent susceptibility to all antibiotics declined from 1995 to 1996. With the exception of imipenem, for which there was no change in resistance, the per cent susceptibility somewhat increased in 1997. However, it was still lower than in 1995.
