Metabolic effects of hypoxia and ethanol on the cell has been comparatively studied. The obtained data suggest their similar molecular-cellular mechanisms. One of the main disturbing effects of both hypoxia and ethanol is disruption of the cellular energy metabolism. It is related to restricted electron transport function of mitochondrial respiratory chain at the level of the first enzyme complex, which inhibits oxidation of the pyridine-dependent substrates, causes hyper-reduction of the NAD-dependent part of the respiratory chain, and significantly decrease the ranges of ATP synthesis during oxidative phosphorylation. The experiments were carried out on male and female white mongrel rats. The influences of oxygen deficiency and ethanol on the organism were studied on a decompression chamber model of hypobaric hypoxia and on isolated perfused heart. Pre-exposition of the animals in conditions of moderate hypoxia as well as preadministration of low ethanol dose proved to significantly enhance individual resistance to acute hypoxic hypoxia. Not only preventive action of moderate ethanol doses enhance the resistance to hypoxia, but also the converse preventive treatment by light hypoxia might improve state of the organism during alcoholic intoxication.
