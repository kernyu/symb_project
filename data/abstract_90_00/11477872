OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution and drug-resistance of gram-negative bacilli in respiratory ward. METHOD: (1) Drug-resistance was tested by Kirby-Bauer disk sensitivity method and MIC by agar doubling dilution. (2) beta-lactanase was tested by nitrocephin. (3) ESBLs was tested by E test. RESULT: (1) Among 345 strains gram-negative bacillus, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginoea was about 39.7%, 17.4%, respectively. (2) Drug-resistance rate of cefotaxime dropped from 42.9% (6 years ago) to 8.2%. (3) beta-lactamase positive rate of 345 strains bacilli was 54.5%. (4) ESBLs was negative. CONCLUSION: (1) Klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aerugries were the main pathogens in lower respiratory tract infection in hospital. (2) Although we didn't find the evidence of ESBLs, we should pay more attention to it in the future.
