The efficacy of the combination therapy of fluconazole plus flucytosine against pulmonary cryptococcosis was investigated. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of antifungal agents were measured by growth inhibition on Yeast-morphology agar plates, and the fractional inhibitory concentration index of each antifungal combination were calculated by checker-board titration. Eight of Cryptococcus neoformans clinical isolates showed sensitivity for AMPH, 5-FC, MCZ and ITZ. C. neoformans showed resistance against FLCZ. The combination of FLCZ plus 5-FC showed synergistic effect against C. neoformans. Three cases of pulmonary cryptococcosis were treated by combination therapy of fluconazole plus flucytosine. After treatment, C. neoformans isolates were eradicated and the chest X-ray improved remarkably. The combination therapy of fluconazole plus flucytosine was effective for the treatment of pulmonary cryptococcosis.
