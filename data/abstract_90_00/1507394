We performed an in vitro assessment of the antibacterial activity of therapy with cefuzonam (CZON) plus minocycline (MINO) against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aures (MRSA) infections. 1. Studies using MINO-susceptible and MINO-resistant MRSA strains suggested that the antibacterial activity of CZON + MINO was dependent on the antibiotic action of MINO, similarly to the case with cefotiam (CTM) + MINO. 2. The antibacterial activity (including the FIC index) of this combination was slightly inferior to that of CTM + MINO. However, the time course of antibacterial efficacy of CZON + MINO in MRSA pretreated with MINO was comparable to that of CTM + MINO. 3. CZON + MINO appeared to be a very useful combination in patients with mixed infections due to MRSA and Gram-negative bacteria.
