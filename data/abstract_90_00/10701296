The prevalence of different serotypes of non-typhoidal Salmonella spp. among patients suffering from acute diarrhoea admitted to the Infectious Diseases Hospital, Calcutta was investigated. The predominant serogroup was C and Salmonella infantis was the major serotype isolated followed by S. worthington, S. enteritidis, S. typhimurium, S. weltevereden and S. newport. All the Salmonella strains were isolated from adults. Multidrug resistance to various antimicrobial agents was observed in 37.5 per cent of the strains. All the strains were sensitive to ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and gentamycin.
