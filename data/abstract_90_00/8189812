The studies were performed at the Intensive Care Unit of the Institute of Pediatrics. There were aimed at determination of cleanliness of boxes together with ante-rooms. At the same time bacterial flora of hospitalized children was investigated. The bacteria were isolated and identified by classical methods and by the API system. Among the identified strains, 60% constituted Gram-positive cocci with dominant participation of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Gram-negative rods (25% of total bacterial number) were represented mainly by Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter. Determination of susceptibility of tested strains toward 24 antibiotics and chemotherapeutics demonstrated wide occurrence of multiple antibiotic-resistance, particularly among enterococci and Gram-negative rods. Tests for susceptibility to disinfectants revealed presence of strains sensitive to chloramine in concentrations a dozen times higher when compared with standard strains. These strains occurred in the ward after systematic use of this disinfectant for many years. After replacement of chloramine by sterinol and chlorhexidine, these bacteria were not detectable after one year.
