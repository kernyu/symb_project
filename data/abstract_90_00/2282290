A total of 322 coliform bacteria Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella spp. and Serratia spp., were isolated from 50 carcasses of commercially slaughtered chickens. Their resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, cephalotine, cotrimoxazole, nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin, were determined. The most commonly found resistance was to tetracycline followed by cephalotine, cotrimoxazole and nalidixic acid. A large percentage of E. coli (41%) and Klebsiella spp. (38%) showed multiple antibiotic resistance.
