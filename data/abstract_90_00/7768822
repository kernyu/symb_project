The GNS1 gene product is required for the synthesis of 1,3-beta-glucan in vitro, since mutations in this gene result in exhibit an 80 to 90% reduction in 1,3-beta-glucan synthase specific activity. gns1 mutant strains display a pleiotropic phenotype including resistance to a pneumocandin B0 analog (L-733,560), slow growth, and mating and sporulation defects. The gns1-1 mutation was genetically mapped to within 1.35 centimorgans from the MAT locus on chromosome III. The wild-type GNS1 gene was isolated by complementing the pneumocandin resistance phenotype of the gns1-1 mutation and by hybridization with a chromosome III-derived sequence being used as a probe. The nucleotide sequence of GNS1 was determined and compared with the homologous region of the chromosome. The genetic and nucleotide sequence analyzes revealed that GNS1 and the open reading frame, YCR34 [S. Oliver, Q. van der Aart, M. Agostoni-Carbone, and the Chromosome III Sequencing Group, Nature (London) 357:38-46, 1992], represent identical loci in the genome. Cells deleted for GNS1 are viable but exhibit slow growth as well as the pleiotropic phenotype of the gns1 mutants. The putative protein product is predicted to be an integral membrane protein with five transmembrane helices displaying an exoplasmic orientation for the N terminus and a cytoplasmic orientation for the C terminus. This protein may be a subunit of 1,3-beta-glucan synthase.
