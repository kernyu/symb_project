The activity of meropenem against 106 imipenem-resistant (MIC > or = 8 mg/l) clinical isolates, and the frequency of resistance to meropenem and imipenem among 24 Enterobacteriaceae was determined. Both agents selected colonies on agar but 20-80% were susceptible after one subculture and 72% of the mutants reverted to susceptibility 1 to 6 months after selection. All isolates and stable mutants were inhibited by > 1 mg/l meropenem, although the MIC of imipenem was 4-16 mg/l. Three of six Xanthomonas maltophilia isolates were susceptible to meropenem (MICs 2-4 mg/l). Pseudomonas aeruginosa lacking outer membrane protein D2 were resistant to meropenem, although isolates with substantially reduced expression of this protein were susceptible. None of the imipenem-resistant gram-positive bacteria were susceptible to meropenem. There was no clear correlation between altered outer membrane protein expression and decreased susceptibility to carbapenems, and there was no apparent involvement of plasmid or chromosomal beta-lactamase.
