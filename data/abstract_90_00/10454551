Proliferation and cell cycle progression in response to growth factors require de novo protein synthesis. It has been proposed that binding of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF-4E) to the inhibitory protein 4BP-1 blocks translation by preventing access of eIF-4G to the 5' cap of the mRNA. The signal for translation initiation is thought to involve phosphorylation of 4BP-1, which causes it to dissociate from eIF-4E and allows eIF-4G to localize to the 5' cap. It has been suggested that the ability of the macrolide antibiotic rapamycin to inhibit 4BP-1 phosphorylation is responsible for the potent antiproliferative property of this drug. We now show that rapamycin-resistant cells exhibited normal proliferation despite dephosphorylation of 4BP-1 that allows it to bind to eIF-4E. Moreover, despite rapamycin-induced dephosphorylation of 4BP-1, eIF-4E-eIF-4G complexes (eIF-4F) were still detected. In contrast, amino acid withdrawal, which caused a similar degree of 4BP-1 dephosphorylation, resulted in dissociation of the eIF-4E-eIF-4G complex. Thus, 4BP-1 dephosphorylation is not equivalent to eIF-4E inactivation and does not explain the antiproliferative property of rapamycin.
