GLYCOPEPTIDE RESISTANCE: Resistance to glycopeptides raises many therapeutic problems when it occurs in strains such as enterococci or staphylococci causing clinical infections. Two observations described here exemplify the emergence of such resistance in a metacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strain during vancomycin treatment and in a Clostridium difficile strain. NASAL MRSA IN HOSPITAL PERSONNEL: Nasal cavities of hospital personnel is a not well recognized reservoir of MRSA. A survey conducted in a Parisian hospital evidenced problems of personnel-patient transmission. MRSA were found in 6% of the hospital personnel samples.
