Two clinical strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, TP 01 and TP 02, presented resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanate and were fully susceptible to cephalothin. These strains produced two beta-lactamases, SHV-1 and a TEM enzyme with a pI of 5.2. The previously described changes Arg-244-->Cys and Arg-244-->Ser in IRT-1 and IRT-2 (A. Belaaouaj, C. Lapoumeroulie, M. M. Canica, G. Vedel, P. Nevot, R. Krishnamoorthy, and G. Paul, FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 120:75-80, 1994) were found in TEM enzymes from the TP 01 and TP 02 strains, respectively. This is the first report of inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT) in species other than Escherichia coli from the family Enterobacteriaceae.
