Antimicrobial susceptibilities and beta-lactamase production of clinical isolates from 1986 to 1991 except 1988 were determined. beta-Lactamase was detected frequently in Escherichia coli (84.7%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (65.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (62.3%), and not frequently in Haemophilus influenzae (22.4%). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus was also resistant to many antimicrobials except to arbekacin and minocycline, and imipenem showed markedly high activity against methicillin-sensitive S. aureus. Susceptibilities of E. coli and K. pneumoniae to cefuzonam, imipenem and ofloxacin were quite high and that of H. influenzae to ofloxacin and cefuzonam was also very high.
