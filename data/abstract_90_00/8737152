The in-vitro activities of the new fluoroquinolone trovafloxacin (CP-99,219) and ciprofloxacin were determined against 225 Gram-positive cocci. Trovafloxacin was 4-32 fold more active than ciprofloxacin against staphylococci and streptococci and also showed greater activity against enterococci including vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis that were highly resistant to aminoglycosides and/or produced beta-lactamase. Trovafloxacin was also bactericidal at 3 mg/L against enterococci except for isolates for which the MICs were > or = 2 mg/L.
