Fifty-seven strains of Streptococcus pyogenes isolated from septic patients and 52 isolates from nonbacteremic patients in southern Israel were investigated for their susceptibility to new macrolides and other antimicrobial drugs. In addition, typing of the isolates by M protein and T antigen was performed. All organisms were susceptible to penicillin and chloramphenicol, 59% to tetracycline, and 7% to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. All isolates but one (99%) were susceptible to clarithromycin, azithromycin, erythromycin, and clindamycin. The MIC90 of clarithromycin, erythromycin, and clindamycin was 0.064, 0.125, and 0.094 microgram/ml, respectively. Overall, 96% of the isolates could be typed by T antigen, but only 43% were M-protein typeable. No predominance of any particular M-protein type was observed. No significant differences between blood isolates and organisms derived from other sources were observed in the antibiotic susceptibility patterns or the distribution of serotypes. It is concluded that invasive Streptococcus pyogenes infections in southern Israel are caused by multiple unrelated strains. The organism remains susceptible to macrolides and clindamycin.
