A 7.24 kb genomic DNA fragment from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome XVI was isolated by complementation of a new temperature-sensitive mutation tsa1. We determined the nucleotide sequence of this fragment located on the right arm of chromosome XVI. Among the three, complete open reading frames: YPR041w, YPR042c and YPR043w contained within this fragment, the gene YPR041w was shown to complement the tsa1 mutation and to correspond to the TIF5 gene encoding an essential protein synthesis initiation translation factor. The YPR042c gene encodes a hypothetical protein of 1075 amino acids containing four putative transmembrane segments and is non-essential for growth. The gene YPR043c encoding the 10 kDa product, highly similar to the human protein L37a from the 60S ribosomal subunit, was found to be essential and a dominant lethal. We conclude that three tightly linked yeast genes are involved in the translation process.
