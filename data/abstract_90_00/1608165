We report a case of pneumonia secondary to aspiration of povidone-iodine, which was used as an oral antiseptic. The patient was 17 y.o. female (body weight: 70 kg) who underwent a transsphenoidal resection of pituitary adenoma. Although she had a history of asthma during her childhood, no asthmatic attacks occurred for the past 10 yrs. After satisfactory anesthesia induction and tracheal intubation, 60 ml of 0.7% povidone-iodine solution was used to clean the oral cavity by a surgeon. Insufficient sealing by the cuff occurred after suturing the tube, which had made a needle hole in the cuff. Arterial oxygen saturation dropped to 90% and an increased resistance in the lungs was noted. The trachea was reintubated and she was transferred to the ICU. Her chest X-ray revealed signs of pneumonia and atelectasis in the right upper lobe. Mechanical ventilation with PEEP and periodical bronchial toilet were performed during her stay in the ICU for 42 hrs. A week was needed for the improvement of her X-ray findings. Although povidone-iodine is thought to be safe and affective antiseptics, severe complications from its aspiration may occur in patients whose airways are sensitive as observed in this case.
