NTG was used to make chemical mutation for Bacillus sphaericus, RifR and SmR labelled strains were selected, which could resist drug as much as 100 u/ml. The resistance to drug was stably inherited. The RifR strain was used as recipient and the plasmid containing the lysostaphin gene was transfered into it by protoplasts. Results showed that the lysostaphin gene could be expressed stably at high level in Bacillus sphaericus and the lysostaphin activity was about 122 u/ml medium after shaking culture.
