In view of the emergence of chloroquine resistant Plasmodium falciparum from more and more geographical areas profiling of the responses to other available antimalarials by in vitro methods have become essential. A preliminary study undertaken in two Primary Health Centres of Karnataka State, India show the presence of strains of P. falciparum resistant to chloroquine and amodiaquine. The response for amodiaquine was poor as compared to chloroquine. The isolates were, however, sensitive to mefloquine and quinine.
