This study was conducted to investigate the antimicrobial susceptibilities of the strains of coagulase negative Staphylococci (CNS) isolates from urine at Juntendo University Hospital in Tokyo from 1989 to 1994. The susceptibility testing were performed according to the broth dilution method standerdized by the Japan Society of Chemotherapy. The following bacteria were tested; Staphylococcus epidermidis (59 strains), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (42 strains), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (30 strains). The antimicrobial agents tested wre as follows; Oxacillin, Cefazolin, Imipenem, Flomoxef, Gentanicin, Tobramycin, Arbekacin, Clindamycin, Tetracycline, Minicycline, Vancomycin, Sulfamethoxaxole-Trimethoprim and, Ofloxacin. 1. 100% of S. caprae, 62% of S. haemolyticus and 42% of S. epidermidis were resistant to Oxacillin. All strains of S. saprophyticus were sensitive to Oxacillin. 2. S. saprophyticus showed the highest sensitivities to all anti-microbial agents. 3. All strains of S. caprae were resistant to Tobramycin and Clindamycine. 4. Vancomycin and Arbecacin has strong antimicrobial activities to all CNS. S. saprophyticus, which is the pathogen of acute urinary tract infections, showed high sensitivities to many antimicrobial agents. On the other hand, S. haemolyticus and S. caprae, which are the predominate microorganisms of bacteriuria of inpatients, showed high resistance rates to antimicrobial agents.
