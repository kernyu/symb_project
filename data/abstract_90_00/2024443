Twenty-four isolates of Pasteurella multocida from clinical cases of fowl cholera and the Clemson University vaccine strain were surveyed for the presence of potential virulence markers. Membrane proteins, enzymatic activity of the membrane proteins, and carbohydrate fermentation patterns were also determined to demonstrate phenotypic relationships within the groups. Few differences were found in these phenotypic characteristics among the isolates. Almost all the organisms produced siderophore and were hemolytic on turkey red blood cells. No extracellular enzyme or bacteriocin activity was detected and little antibiotic resistance was found. However, many organisms contained plasmids and demonstrated some degree of resistance to complement. Both characteristics were correlative markers in Pasteurella multocida isolated from birds with fowl cholera.
