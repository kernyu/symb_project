Staphylococcus aureus is one of the main causes of bacteriaemia. Haemodialysis patients are likely to develop bacteriaemia due to S. aureus, probably because they are often carriers of S. aureus and also frequently have intravascular catheters. This case report describes a very rare complication of S. aureus sepsis in a 62-year-old haemodialysis patient, namely a suprarenal aneurysm of the abdominal aorta.
