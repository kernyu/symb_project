As with any public health problem, the evolution of antibacterial resistance must be viewed from a perspective of risk, and analysed in terms of probabilities within the populations. It is necessary to be able to predict the risk of antibacterial resistance, in the future, and two main strategies have recently been developed in mathematical models that may help to evaluate these risks. It is also important to understand how antibiotics are used and how their use affects the evolution of antibacterial resistance. Understanding the epidemiology of antibacterial resistance will enable us to develop preventive strategies to limit existing resistance and to avoid the emergence of new strains of resistant bacteria.
