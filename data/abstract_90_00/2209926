An extended study from 1978-88 revealed that in the western states of India i.e., Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra; P. falciparum resistance to chloroquine has a scattered pattern in its distribution. However in Gujarat, R-III level of resistance is established in southern districts showing four fold increase from 1.79% in 1985 to 8.2% in 1988. In this area use of some alternate drug is indicated.
