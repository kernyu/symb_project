Over a five-year period, 125 newborns with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) were managed by us. Their mean birthweight was 1700 g and mean maturity was 32 weeks. Before commencement of antibiotics, routine septic work-up was done in order to define the bacterial spectrum and antibiotic sensitivity. The study includes aerobic and anaerobic cultures of gastric and pharyngeal aspirates, blood cultures, umbilical swabs and culture of umbilical catheter tips in relevant cases. Peritoneal swab results were also analyzed if laparatomy was performed. Positive cultures were present in 45 patients (36%) with 55 positive specimens. Fifteen types of organism were isolated: the commonest was Enterobacter (29%), followed by E. coli (14.5%) and Klebsiella (13%). They were resistant to ampicillin and first-generation cephalosporin. These organisms were usually opportunistic pathogens. Overgrowth of them may be the cause of NEC. Regular review of the antibiotic sensitivity of these organisms allows prompt and appropriate choice of antibiotics. At the same time, antibiotic sensitivity for these organisms was analyzed to guide us in the choice of antibiotic therapy.
