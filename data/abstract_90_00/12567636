OBJECTIVE: To compare the pharmacokinetic differences of chloroquine in normal mice and the mice infected with the N and the RC strains of Plasmodium berghei. METHODS: The concentrations of chloroquine in the plasma of normal mice and the mice infected with the N or the RC strains of P. berghei were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC. The pharmacokinetic parameters were measured with software 3P87. RESULTS: The t1/2 beta value was significantly lower in the mice infected with the RC strain than in normal mice and the mice infected with the N strain(P < 0.05), however, there were no significant differences between the mice infected with the N strain and normal mice. CONCLUSION: Elimination of chloroquine in the mice infected with the RC strain of P. berghei speed up significantly comparing with the mice infected with the N strain.
