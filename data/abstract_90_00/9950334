The drug sensitivities of 16 Trypanosoma evansi isolates from Sudan were examined using two different in vitro assays and rodent models. IC50 values (concentration which inhibited incorporation of 3H-hypoxanthine by 50%) obtained in a 40 h assay indicate that most of the isolates were resistant to suramin, a drug which has not been used in Sudan since 1975. Sensitivities for suramin in a 10-day-in vitro assay varied within a 124-fold range. The in vitro results were confirmed by infection/treatment experiments in mice. Sensitivities in vitro for quinapyramine varied within a 166-fold range. In mice, the least sensitive isolates were not cured with dosages up to 10 mg/kg quinapyramine. Based on in vitro results, all isolates appeared to be susceptible to isometamidium.
