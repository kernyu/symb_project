Salmonella enteritidis strains which are multiply resistant to antimicrobial agents were isolated from the blood of 12 patients hospitalized at the Institut Pasteur of Bangui, Central African Republic, during a 4.5-month period. The lack of gas production in Kligler-Hajna medium initially suggested Salmonella typhi, but isolates were confirmed as unusual S. enteritidis strains. The occurrence of these unique strains in an unusual site of infection may indicate an epidemic due to an unusually invasive and resistant strain of S. enteritidis. Some variation in plasmid profile and susceptibility to antimicrobial agents was noted, possibly reflecting antibiotic pressures existing in the Central African Republic. All isolates were of the same bacteriophage lysis pattern, unlike patterns documented for recent U.S. and European isolates of S. enteritidis.
