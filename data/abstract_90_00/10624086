A total of 674 Salmonella serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) strains consisting of 522 domestic strains and 152 imported strains isolated in Tokyo, 1980-1998, were examined regarding their drug-resistance and phage-type. Domestic strains accounted for 6.2% of all Salmonella (8,359 strains) isolated from domestic cases, and imported strains accounted for 3.7% of all Salmonella (4,083 strains) isolated from imported cases. A drug-resistance test using 9 drugs (CP, TC, SM, KM, ABPC, ST, NA, FOM, and NFLX) showed that 245 strains (46.9%) of the domestic strains and 109 strains (71.7%) of the imported strains were resistant to some of the drugs, excluding FOM and NFLX. Drugs with a high resistance rate were TC, SM, ABPC, and CP for both groups. Drug-resistance patterns of the resistant strains varied among the 40 types. Among those, prevalent patterns recognized were CP.TC.SM.ABPC, CP.TC.SM.KM.ABPC, TC.SM, SM, and TC.KM in the domestic strains, and TC, CP.TC.SM.ABPC, CP.TC.SM.KM.ABPC, CP.TC.SM.KM.ABPC.ST and TC.KM in the imported strains. The results of the phage-typing test revealed that 31 strains of 52 domestic strains tested, and 13 strains of 46 imported strains tested were definitive type 104 (DT104). Those resistance patterns were CP.TC.SM.ABPC.SU (43 strains) and CP.TC.SM.KM.ABPC.SU (1 strain).
