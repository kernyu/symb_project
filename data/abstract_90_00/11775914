OBJECTIVE: To analyse the clinical characteristics of lower respiratory tract infection caused by Xanthomonas maltophilia and to investigate the antibiotic sensitivity of Xanthomonas maltophilia strains. METHODS: Retrospective study of the clinical data of 54 cases with lower respiratory tract infection by Xanthomonas maltophilia, including risk factors of morbidity, clinical symptoms and signs, X-ray findings, blood routine test, treatment and prognosis. Drug sensitivity against strains of Xanthomonas maltophilia by K-B method was studied. RESULTS: There were 39 males and 15 females, the mean age being 51 +/- 17 years. 87% of the cases had underlying diseases, most of which were COPD complicated by respiratory failure. 57% of the cases were immunocompromised. 39% of the cases were in ICU or CCU. 54% of the cases accepted invasive treatments, and 93% of the cases were given broad-spectrum antibiotics. Clinical manifestations include chill (72%), fever (80%), cough (94%) and expectoration (91%). The chest X-ray revealed infiltration in lower lobes of both lungs. 16 cases had consolidations, and 11 cases were complicated with pleural effusions. The drug sensitivity test in vitro showed that these strains were multiresistant to commonly used antibiotics, and drugs whose sensitive rate were over 50% included SMZco, ceftazidine, and timentin. CONCLUSIONS: The lower respiratory tract infections caused by Xanthomonas maltophilia develop at patients with various underlying diseases, especially in the immunocompromised patients. Risk factors of morbidity were: patients in ICU or CCU, acceptance of invasive treatment and inappropriate use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Clinical manifestations include severely toxic symptoms and some cases had pulmonary consolidations and pleural effusions.
