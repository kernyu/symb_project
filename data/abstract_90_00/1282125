Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a neurotransmitter in sympathetic nerve fibers in human nasal mucosa. Like norepinephrine, NPY acts as a vasoconstrictor. An established method of nasal provocation was used to determine the effects of topically applied NPY on nasal resistance to airflow measured by anterior rhinomanometry, the protein content of nasal secretions, and the protein content of bradykinin-induced secretions. NPY (2.3 nmol) reduced the resistance to inspiratory airflow by 57 +/- 18% (P < 0.001) in 10 normal subjects and by 50 +/- 17% (P < 0.05) in 12 subjects with perennial rhinitis. In nasal provocations, NPY in doses of 0.1-10 nmol had no effect on vascular (albumin), glandular (lysozyme, glycoconjugate), or total proteins present in lavaged nasal secretions. Because the vasoconstrictor properties of NPY may only be apparent in the presence of increased vascular permeability and albumin exudation, bradykinin (BK) nasal provocation was performed. BK (500 nmol) significantly increase total protein (10- to 20-fold), albumin (10- to 30-fold), and glycoconjugate (2- to 5-fold) in lavage fluid. NPY (2.3 nmol) reduced BK-induced total protein by 59 +/- 15% (P < 0.05) and albumin by 63 +/- 17% (P < 0.02) but had no significant effect on glandular secretion. Therefore exogenous administration of NPY to the human nasal mucosa reduced nasal airflow resistance and albumin exudation without affecting submucosal gland secretion. NPY agonists may be useful for the treatment of mucosal diseases characterized by vasodilation, vascular permeability, and plasma exudation.
