The standard medium for disk diffusion and MIC testing of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (that of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards) was tested to establish zone correlations for the MIC breakpoints currently used in Sweden. Eight gonococcal control strains representing both susceptible and resistant strains and 50 clinical isolates were tested. The standard medium did not support the growth of two control strains and three clinical isolates when the standardized inoculum was used in the disk diffusion test. The same medium with the addition of hemoglobin was introduced. This medium supported the growth of all strains. The correlations between the MICs and the zones of inhibition were calculated for penicillin, ampicillin, cefuroxime, erythromycin, tetracycline, doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, and spectinomycin. The range of MICs for the clinical isolates were broad, without bimodal distribution, for all antibiotics, except ciprofloxacin and spectinomycin. With the susceptibility distribution of MICs and zones near the current susceptible and intermediate or intermediate and resistant limits, a low reproducibility of tests and a high frequency of minor interpretive errors can be expected. A revision of MIC breakpoints seems warranted but can only be done after renewed clinical evaluation of different treatment regimens.
