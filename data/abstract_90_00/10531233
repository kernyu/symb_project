129sv mice functionally deleted of the antimicrobial resistance gene, Nramp1, were found to be as resistant as wild-type mice to infection with the virulent H37Rv strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, as determined by monitoring bacterial growth in major organs and recording host survival times. Death of infected mice of both types was associated with extensive infection-induced pathology in the lungs but not in other major organs. These findings are in keeping with the view that Nramp1 is of limited importance in resistance to tuberculosis in mice.
