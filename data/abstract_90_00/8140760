The authors discuss some properties of recent cephalosporin antibiotics and the antibiotics effectiveness in particular of more recent generations of cephalosporins. The increasing resistance to penicillins and other antibiotics called for use effective cephalosporins of new generations. While cephalosporins of the 1st generation (cephalothin, cephazoline, and oral cephaloridine or cephaclor) are effective against Gram-positive bacteria, haemophilus bacteria and Klebsiellae, the resistance of other bacteria even against these antibiotics is increasing. Mephoxine and cephuroxime belong to the 2nd generation as their spectrum of efficiency is wider. Cephalosporins of the 3rd generation (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime and others) are effective only against strains resistant to cephalosporins of the older generations. Oral preparations of cephalosporins of recent generations (Loracarbef, cefpodoxim, ceftibutene) are also useful.
