The in vitro activity of fluconazole, itraconazole and ketoconazole against 625 Candida yeast strains from patients treated at the University Hospital of the Canaries, by means of a micromethod of dilution in broth enriched with Yeast Nitrogen Base (YNB), and buffered to pH7, has been assessed. Species distribution was as follows: Candida albicans (388), Candida tropicalis (84), Candida glabrata (84), Candida parapsilosis (69). Our results show 10.0% and 8.8% of C. albicans resistant to itraconazole and fluconazole, respectively, and 1.8% resistant to ketoconazole; 39.5% of C. tropicalis were resistant to itraconazole, 34.5% to fluconazole and 2.4% to ketaconazole. 19.1% of C. glabrata were resistant to fluconazole and 13.1% to itraconazole; 4.4% of C. parapsilosis were resistant to fluconazole and 1.5% to itraconazole. In general C. tropicalis was the most resistant strain and C. parapsilosis the most sensitive. The greatest percentages of resistance in vitro were seen with the two triazols.
