A series of benzothiadiazine derivatives were screened against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and certain structure-activity relationships were defined for anti-HIV activity in this chemical class. The selected representative NSC 287474 was a highly potent inhibitor of HIV-induced cell killing and HIV replication in a variety of human cell lines, as well as in fresh human peripheral blood lymphocytes and macrophages. The compound was active against a panel of biologically diverse laboratory and clinical strains of HIV-1, including the AZT-resistant strain G910-6. However, the agent was inactive against HIV-2, and also against both nevirapine- and pyridinone-resistant strains (N119 and A17) of HIV-1, which are cross-resistant to several structurally diverse nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. The compound selectively inhibited HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, but not HIV-2 reverse transcriptase. Combination of NSC 287474 with AZT synergistically inhibited HIV-1-induced cell killing in vitro. The compound did not inhibit the replication of the Rauscher murine leukemia retrovirus or the simian immunodeficiency virus. The benzothiadiazine class of compounds represents a new active anti-HIV-1 chemotype within the diverse group of nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.
