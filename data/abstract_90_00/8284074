Oropharyngeal candidiasis develops in up to 95% of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Oral fluconazole is frequently prescribed for persons who are human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive as initial or suppressive therapy for oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis or as suppressive therapy for cryptococcal meningitis. We report two cases of oropharyngeal candidiasis, caused by Candida albicans, which developed in two patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome who had taken fluconazole for extended periods. In addition to the clinical resistance we observed, isolates of the organism appeared to be resistant in vitro to fluconazole and ketoconazole.
