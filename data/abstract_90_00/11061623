Thirty water isolates of A. hydrophila were tested for potential virulence profiles, antibiotic resistance and Bacteriocin-Like Substances (BLS) production. Cytotoxic activity was present in all strains tested, 87% were hemolytic and 70% adhesive. Lysine decarboxylase reactions (LDC) positivity was correlated with virulence factors: 100% versus cytotoxicity, 84% versus adherence, 76% versus hemolytic activity. The correlation was also present in the LDC-negative strains. Hemolytic and cytotoxic activities were frequently associated: high cytotoxicity, corresponding to high hemolytic activity and vice versa. The in vitro susceptibility of A. hydrophila to 28 antibacterial agents showed that cefotaxime was the most active beta-lactam antibiotic, and Cefuroxime inhibited 90% of the strains. Isolates were resistant to Penicillin G, Ampicillin, Carbenicillin, Amoxicillin, Cephalotin and Cefaclor. Tetracycline, Chloramphenicol, Nitrofurantoine, the quinolones and the aminoglycosides (except Streptomycin) were consistently active. BLS production never emerged against closely-related microorganisms. On the contrary A. hydrophila presented a heteroinhibitory activity against non-taxonomically related genera such as Listeria spp. (L. seeligeri NCTC 11856, L. welshimeri NCTC 11857, L. ivanovii NCTC 11846) and S. aureus ATCC 25923. Although a large number of strains showed virulence determinants together with other biological characters such as antibiotic resistance and BLS production, it was not possible to relate these factors to the observed plasmids.
