Resistance of uropathogenic bacteria to antibiotics is an increasing problem in primary health care. The aim of this study was to evaluate antibacterial susceptibility testing of uropathogenic bacteria when performed in general practice. Urine specimens with a known quantity of typically uropathogenic bacteria were sent to 25 general practices. The predictive values of testing a bacterial strain as susceptible ranged from 0.89 (nitrofurantoin) to 1.00 (sulphamethizole), and the predictive value of testing a bacterial strain as resistant ranged from 0.55 (trimethoprim) to 0.90 (nitrofurantoin). Interventions to improve the validity of susceptibility testing are desirable if the test should be incorporated in the diagnostic armamentarium in general practice.
