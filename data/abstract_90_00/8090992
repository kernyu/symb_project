The mercury resistance determinant of marine Pseudomonas sp. strain MR1 plasmid pMR1 was cloned into a narrow-host-range vector pUC18. A direct selection of mercury resistant clones was successful and 12 clones were evolved; 9 from direct selection on mercury agar plates and 3 from ampicillin-resistant white colonies. All the predicted clones efficiently volatilized mercury. One of the hybrid plasmids pMRD5, containing a 15.5-kb insert, conferred inducible resistance to both HgCl2 and phenyl mercury acetate with over a 40-fold increase in mer resistance in Escherichia coli HB101. No DNA homology existed between the mer operon of Pseudomonas sp. strain MR1 and the characterized determinants of Tn501 mer DNA.
