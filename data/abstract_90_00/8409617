We report a case in conjunction with MRSA sepsis, who needed re-mitral valve replacement (re-MVR) and re-tricuspid valve imposition (re-TVI), and who was successfully treated with a number of antibiotics in conjunction with hyperthermal extracorporeal circulation. Initially, we performed MVR and tricuspid valve superimposition on a 62-year-old woman lationing under the MRSA sepsis condition to control against heart failure. However, she developed a fever following the first operation, and MRSA was detected from her blood cultivation. She thus underwent treatment employing many kinds of antibiotics. A thickened C.E. valve at the tricuspid valve cardiac echogram suggested PVE, we performed a second operation of re-MVR and re-TVI about a year after the first operation. We used a tangl of antibiotics during the operation, adding Vancomycin into the extracorporeal circulation, and utilized hyperthermal extracorporeal circulation. This patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with no recurrence arising at 23 months after the second operation.
