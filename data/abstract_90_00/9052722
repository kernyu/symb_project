Previous studies have shown that the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase mutation Y181C, which confers high-level resistance to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), develops rarely during therapy with NNRTIs plus zidovudine. To determine whether didanosine (ddI) is also effective in preventing the emergence of Y181C, we analyzed delavirdine (DLV) susceptibilties and reverse transcriptase sequences of isolates obtained from patients enrolled in a pharmacokinetic study of DLV and ddI. Nine NNRTI-naive patients were evaluated. Seven received DLV/ddI and two received DLV/ddI/zidovudine. Median durations of prior zidovudine and ddI were 26 and 15 months, respectively. Isolates from eight of nine patients had a mutation(s) associated with nucleoside resistance at entry. After treatment with DLV and ddI alone, isolates from five of seven patients developed Y181C, four in combination with K103N. Thus, in this group of nucleoside-experienced patients, combination therapy with DLV/ddI did not prevent the emergence of Y181C.
