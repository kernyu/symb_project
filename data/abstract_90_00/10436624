OBJECTIVE: The assessment, in its qualitative dimension, of the utilization--by HIV infected individuals--of selected prescribed drugs during the process of the search for and the obtaining of care in public health services in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. METHODS: Fifty two semi-structured interviews with patients, health care workers and non-governamental organizations volunteers were carried out and 1,079 medical records were reviewed. Data were obtained on the utilization of prescribed drugs by HIV infected individuals, whose first visit to one of the public services studied occurred between January 1989 and December 1992. Problems related to the use of anti-retroviral and/or opportunistic infection medication were identified and a qualitative description of their possible causes and consequences was commented on. RESULTS: Refusal to use, difficulty in obtaining and in complying with the prescription were the main problems related to anti-retroviral drug use. Causes for such problems included: fear or occurrence of side effects, large number of daily capsules/pills, insufficient and/or irregular distribution of drugs by the public health services and the high cost of anti-retroviral therapy. Based on the reports, the main consequences are likely to be no or late use of anti-retroviral drugs, an increase in resistance and a worsening of the clinical course of the infection. Other problems identified were: self-medication, difficulty in obtaining medications for associated pathologies and in complying with sulfa prescription. CONCLUSION: A better understanding of the main obstacles and difficulties experienced by the user of the services, from the moment of the prescription and throughout the treatment, may contribute to an improvement in compliance and the availability and adequate distribution of drugs.
