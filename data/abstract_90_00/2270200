Clinical, bacteriological and immunological research into leprosy is pursued at the Anandaban Leprosy Hospital on the outskirts of Kathmandu in Nepal with support from the World Health Organization and research laboratories in inter alia Holland and Australia. The bacteriological part consists of research into cultivation procedures on mice for diagnosis of Mycobacterium Leprae resistance to dapsone and rifampicin. Serological studies have also yielded M. Leprae-specific antibodies, a method which, it is hoped, will be further developed as an aid to diagnosis and follow-up of treatment. Research concerning a leprosy vaccine is also in progress.
