The mechanisms regulating resistance or susceptibility to African trypanosomes have been enigmatic. In this study, we assessed the production of several cytokines (IL-4, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha) in vivo and in vitro using genetically susceptible (BALB/c) or resistant (C57BL/6) mice infected with cloned Trypanosoma congolense and the role of these cytokines in pathogenesis of this infection. Plasma of infected BALB/c mice contained higher levels of IL-4 and IFN-gamma than the plasma of infected C57BL/6 mice. Conversely, plasma TNF-alpha levels were elevated significantly in the resistant mice relative to the susceptible ones. Splenic IFN-gamma mRNA appeared earlier and were maintained at higher levels in infected BALB/c than in C57BL/6 mice. Both spontaneous and Con A-induced secretions of IL-4 and IFN-gamma by splenocytes from infected BALB/c mice were significantly higher than those from their C57BL/6 counterparts. Con A-induced proliferation of splenocytes from infected BALB/c mice was progressively suppressed. Nitric oxide was not involved in this suppression, but the suppression was positively correlated with IFN-gamma secretion. Addition of neutralizing Abs to IFN-gamma to cultures of Con A-stimulated spleen cells from infected BALB/c mice effectively reversed this suppression. Furthermore, administration of anti-IFN-gamma Abs to BALB/c mice early during infection dramatically shifted the phenotype of these susceptible mice to a more resistant-like phenotype, as expressed by a low and undulating parasitemia and a >300% increase in survival period. These results strongly suggest that the enhanced induction and secretion of IFN-gamma during T. congolense infections contribute to the relative susceptibility of BALB/c mice to the disease.
