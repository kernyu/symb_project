The effectiveness of skin decontamination by chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) in the presence of commonly-used skin moisturizing lotions was evaluated using vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) as a representative nosocomial pathogen. Anti-bacterial efficacy was determined in vitro using pigskin preparations inoculated with five VREF clinical isolates to evaluate Calgon Vestal 2 and 4% (by weight) CHG solutions in comparison with Hibiclens Antiseptic Antimicrobial Cleaner (4% CHG solution). Control inocula were determined for each experiment from recovery of VREF harvested directly from the surface of each control piece of skin. These CHG formulations were evaluated in the presence and absence of Calgon Vestal 'Lotion Soft Skin Conditioner' (LSSC) to determine potential interactions of CHG with LSSC, and also with inverted question markVaseline Intensive Care' lotion as a CHG-deactivating agent. The 2% Calgon Vestal CHG alone reduced VREF 10(2)-10(3)-fold, as well as 10(3)-10(4)-fold when LSSC was present, and was as efficacious as either 4% CHG solution when these were tested in the presence of LSSC. Four percent Calgon Vestal CHG produced reductions of 10(3)-10(5)-fold with or without LSSC present. Conversely, inverted question markHibiclens' showed similar reductions in the presence of LSSC to that for the Calgon Vestal 4% CHG, but only a 10(1)-10(3)-fold reduction without LSSC. inverted question markVaseline Intensive Care' lotion completely inactivated the VREF-killing effects for all of the CHG formulations tested, while LSSC and inverted question markVaseline Intensive Care' lotion both showed minimal activity alone against these VREF isolates. These results indicate that the Calgon Vestal 2% CHG solution is as effective against VREF, even in the presence of LSSC, as either the 4% Calgon Vestal or Hibiclens 4% CHG formulations; the use of this lower concentration of CHG may be associated with less irritation, particularly with concomitant use of LSSC.
