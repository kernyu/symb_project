The objective of this study was to determine the response rate and toxicity of high-dose cytosine arabinoside (AC) and mitoxantrone (M) in relapsed or refractory childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and to correlate response with the expression of the multidrug resistance gene 1 (mdr1). Twenty-nine patients were treated with AC 1.0 g/m2 infused over 2 h every 12 h for eight doses (days 1-4) and M 12 mg/m2 infused over 1 h (days 3-6). Mdr1 expression was determined by a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay. Ten of 15 patients (67%) with AML obtained a complete remission (CR) of 3 to 30+ months duration. Eight of 14 (57%) ALL patients obtained a CR of 1 to 23+ months duration. The major toxicities were hematopoietic and infectious. Seventy-nine per cent of patients developed a documented infection during induction. Mdr1 did not correlate with a lower induction rate. This AC/M regimen is active in childhood AML and ALL.
