Cases of penicillin-resistant pneumococcal meningitis have been reported in other countries since 1977, but never before reported in Taiwan. In 1990, two cases of the disease were diagnosed here. Case one was a two-year-old boy who had had fever and vomiting for several days prior to admission. Under the impression of meningitis, a spinal tap was done. The CSF yielded pneumococcus, which was misinterpreted as sensitive to penicillin. Penicillin (400,000 units/kg/day) was given parenterally without effect. On the 12th day after admission, another spinal tap still yielded pneumococcus. This time the sensitivity test was reread with great care, and then reported to be penicillin-resistant pneumococcus. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of penicillin was performed simultaneously and it revealed 0.1 microgram/ml. Vancomycin (60 mg/kg/day) was substituted for penicillin. The patient became afebrile two days later, and was discharged ten days later without sequelae. Case two, a five-month-old girl, was diagnosed to have meningitis because of fever, vomiting, tense fontanel and seizure on admission. After a spinal tap was done, she was put on ampicillin and cefotaxime. The fever subsided two days later. At that time, the CSF was reported to grow pneumococcus, again misread as sensitive to penicillin. The antibiotics was switched to penicillin, but fever recurred. The second spinal tap still yielded pneumococcus which was sensitive to penicillin but resitstant to oxacillin. Based on experience with the first case, penicillin was changed to vancomycin, and performed MIC immediately. The MIC was 1.0 microgram/ml. The patient became afebrile two days later, and was discharged in good condition after ten days of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
