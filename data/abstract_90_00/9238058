A M182T substitution was discovered as a second-site suppressor of a missense mutation in TEM-1 beta-lactamase. The combination of the M182T substitution with other substitutions in the enzyme indicates the M182T substitution is a global suppressor of missense mutations in beta-lactamase. The M182T substitution also is found in natural variants of TEM-1 beta-lactamase with altered substrate specificity that have evolved in response to antibiotic therapy. The M182T substitution may have been selected in natural isolates as a suppressor of folding or stability defects resulting from mutations associated with drug resistance. This pathway of protein evolution may occur in other targets of antimicrobial drugs such as the HIV protease.
