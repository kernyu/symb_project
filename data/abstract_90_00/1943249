Despite the introduction of newer, less toxic antimicrobial agents, the aminoglycosides continue to serve a useful role in the treatment of serious enterococcal and gram-negative bacillary infections. Gentamicin, because of its low cost, remains the aminoglycoside of choice in hospitals with low levels of resistance among Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Amikacin is useful against gentamicin-resistant gram-negative bacilli and also in the treatment of infections caused by susceptible Nocardia and nontuberculous mycobacteria. An alarming increase in resistance to aminoglycosides among enterococci has been noted, despite little change in susceptibility patterns among gram-negative bacilli. Future efforts will need to be directed toward a better understanding of mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance and toward the prevention of aminoglycoside-induced toxicity.
