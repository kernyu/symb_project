A fluorescence assay for streptogramin B lyase, an enzyme that confers resistance to streptogramin B antibiotics, has been developed. The antibiotic substrates are fluorescent and the linear peptide products formed in the lyase-catalyzed reaction are relatively nonfluorescent. The assay has potential for assessing bacterial resistance to streptogramin B antibiotics and will be utilized to direct the purification of streptogramin B lyase from bacterial extracts.
