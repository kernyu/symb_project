Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell malignancy which is generally incurable in spite of a high initial response to chemotherapy. Relapsing disease commonly heralds an increase in the incidence of drug resistance which is often mediated by the product of the MDR-1 gene, P-glycoprotein (Pgp). One approach to modulating drug resistance due to Pgp overexpression has involved the use of agents known as chemomodulators which inhibit its function. We have developed a human xenograft model of multiple myeloma using the SCID mouse to evaluate the efficacy and toxicities of new MDR-1 chemomodulators. Cyclosporin A (CsA) is a widely used immunosuppressant which has been demonstrated to be a potent inhibitor of Pgp in vitro at concentrations which are clinically achievable. Preliminary studies revealed an acute toxicity in our SCID model which was associated with the combination of CsA and doxorubicin, and which was not observed with either drug alone, nor with cremaphor, the vehicle for CsA. In the current study, non-tumor bearing SCID mice were dosed with doxorubicin or the combination of doxorubicin with cremaphor, verapamil or CsA. Animals were sacrificed and tissues harvested for morphologic examination and for HPLC analysis of doxorubicin levels. In all tissues examined, there was a marked increase in tissue levels of doxorubicin when combined with CsA. Results also revealed a higher incidence and severity of myocardial damage in those animals receiving the combination of doxorubicin and CsA than in those receiving other combinations. The elevations in tissue levels observed with doxorubicin and CsA may contribute to the acute toxicities observed in the SCID mouse model.
