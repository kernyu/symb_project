The occurrence of High Level Gentamicin Resistance (HLGR) was tested among the strains of Enterococcus genus isolated from material potent to microbiological laboratory. The investigation included 184 strains of enterococci, and among them 178 strains of Enterococcus faecalis (96.7%) and 6 strains of Enterococcus faecium (3.3%). HLGR was detected with disks-diffusion method with disks containing 120 micrograms of gentamicin. The screen method with MHA-2 containing 500 mg/l of gentamicin in doubtful results was used. The resistance to high concentration of gentamicin was detected in 29 strains of enterococci (15.76%). The highest percentage of HLGR was proved among strains of enterococci isolated from pyogenic material of hospitalised patients (27.3%).
