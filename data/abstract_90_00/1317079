The difficulties encountered in measuring the susceptibility of the association amoxicillin/clavulanate can be a cause for disagreements between laboratories. With an inoculum standardized at 10(4) CFU/spot, the resistance level of E. coli approaches 10%. If the variety of current methods is taken into account, the evaluation of a resistance increase can only be an internal one, specific for each laboratory, provided that methods do not change in the course of time.
