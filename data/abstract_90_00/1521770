Cytoplasmic precursors of the peptidoglycan biosynthetic pathway were purified from vancomycin-treated, glycopeptide-sensitive and -resistant strains of Enterococcus faecium. Resistance was due to production of a modified precursor, UDP-MurNAc-L-Ala-D-Glu-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-lactate, where lactate was identified on the basis of mass of the precursor and on its ability to act as a substrate for D-lactate dehydrogenase after release from the precursor. The presence of the D-lactate residue instead of D-alanine in the terminal position would hinder formation of a vancomycin-precursor complex, without preventing incorporation of the precursor into mature peptidoglycan.
