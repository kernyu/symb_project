Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are promising drugs for the treatment of HIV when used in combination with other anti-HIV drugs such as nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors and protease inhibitors.

This review discusses the properties of the FDA-approved NNRTI drugs and focuses on the recent efforts being made to produce second generation inhibitors that circumvent this resistance problem.
