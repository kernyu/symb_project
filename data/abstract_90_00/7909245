In order to confirm our initial report on the negative impact of MDR1 gene expression on the outcome of de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we present an update of our prospective study with a larger number of patients and a longer duration of follow-up. At diagnosis, MDR1 RNA expression of the leukemic cells was negative in 37% and positive in 63% of the patients (N = 79). The complete remission rate of induction chemotherapy was 76% for MDR1 RNA negative and 54% for MDR1 RNA positive patients (p = 0.05). At a median observation duration of 33 months, the duration of overall survival was 19 months for the MDR1 RNA negative patients but only 8 months for the patients with MDR1 gene expression (p = 0.02). Thus the long-term data also indicate that MDR1 gene expression is an unfavourable prognostic factor in AML.
