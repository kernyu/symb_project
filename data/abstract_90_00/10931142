Pseudomonas aeruginosa-resistant BALB/c and susceptible C57Bl/6 (B6) mice were immunized with heat-killed Pseudomonas either in the foot pad or via the trachea, and panels of Pseudomonas-specific T cell clones were developed from lymph nodes and lungs. All clones from either strain, whether of lymph node or lung origin, were CD3+CD4+CD8-TCRalphabeta+. The efficacy of cloning from lymph node cells was comparable between BALB/c and B6 mice. All lymph node BALB/c clones proliferated in response to Pseudomonas antigen in a dose-dependent manner, and this response was MHC class II-restricted. Vigorous proliferation by a considerable proportion of B6 T cell clones occurred in the absence of specific antigen. Lymph node clones from either strain could be categorized as either Th1 or Th0 on the basis of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)/IL-4 production. In either mouse strain the efficacy of cloning from lung tissue was substantially lower than from lymph nodes, but the efficacy of cloning from BALB/c compared with B6 lungs was higher. Four lung T cell clones from BALB/c and two from B6 mice were expanded for further analyses, and an interstrain difference was observed in cytokine production. Both B6 lung T cell clones were Th1-like and produced IFN-gamma but not IL-4 and IL-10, whereas four BALB/c lung T cell clones were Th2-like and produced IL-4 and IL-10 but not IFN-gamma. These observations suggest that differences in the CD4+ Th response in the lung may contribute to differences among inbred mouse strains in the level of resistance to bronchopulmonary Pseudomonas infection.
