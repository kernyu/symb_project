The antimicrobial susceptibilities of 1058 Staphylococcus aureus and 2,163 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) isolates obtained from clinical specimen between 1988 and 1995, were determined against 13 anti-staphylococcal antibiotics. During the study period the resistance of Staphylococcus aureus to ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, and norfloxacin increased significantly by 7%, 4%, and 6%, respectively (p < or = 0.001). By comparison, the antibiotic resistance of CNS to ceftazidime, oxacillin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, fusidic acid, and cefoxitin increased by 20%, 17%, 15%, 14%, 12% and 10%, respectively (p < or = 0.001). Invasive and noninvasive S. aureus had similar antibiotic resistance, whereas CNS invasive isolates were more resistant than noninvasive isolates to every antibiotics, except vancomycin and fusidic acid. These differences were significant (p < 0.001) for oxacillin, cefoxitin, and clindamycin. Our observations confirm that staphylococci and particularly CNS isolates show an important rate of increased resistance to the standard antimicrobials used for therapy, and that the rate of emergence of resistance differ considerably between coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci.
