The glycopeptide antibacterial drugs, vancomycin and teicoplanin, are widely used in hospitals for therapy of severe or multiresistant infection that has a positive results on Gram's stain test. Although vancomycin resistance is common in some hospital-acquired Enterococcus sp and resistance to teicoplanin occurs among Staphylococci sp glycopeptides remain the cornerstone of therapy for infection due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus organisms, and infection related to implanted devices. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of these agents remains controversial, but advances in our understanding of their pharmacodynamics and further clinical studies are helping clarify the situation. In the future, a more rational approach to monitoring will probably result in less intensive monitoring of vancomycin but more intensive monitoring of teicoplanin.
