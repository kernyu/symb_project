We tested the in vivo activity of leustroducsin B (LSN B), a new colony-stimulating factor (CSF) inducer isolated from the culture broth of Streptomyces platensis, with mice infected with Escherichia coli. Treatment with LSN B augmented the host resistance to lethal infection of E. coli at doses between 0.1 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg. Serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were found to increase after this treatment, and superoxide anion generation of neutrophils was enhanced in vivo, suggesting that LSN B augmented the host resistance at least in part by inducing IL-6, which subsequently enhanced the bactericidal activity of the neutrophils.
