The susceptibility of 455 Escherichia coli blood culture isolate to piperacillin was tested with the disk diffusion test. The presence of different beta-lactamase genes in these strains was also studied using DNA hybridization. Of the TEM beta-lactamase producing isolates, 64% (61/95) were interpreted as intermediately susceptible to piperacillin. Because piperacillin is hydrolyzed by TEM-type beta-lactamases, we suggest that the intermediate susceptibility category should be reduced or omitted in testing piperacillin susceptibility of Escherichia coli isolates.
