A review of the evolution of bacterial resistance to third-generation cephalosporins is presented, focusing mainly on the prototypical member of this group-cefotaxime. Third-generation cephalosporins generally remain highly active against most Enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci, streptococci, Haemophilus, and Neisseriaceae. Only enterobacteria with a high frequency of mutant derepressed strains that hyperproduce chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase, Pseudomonas spp., and some glucose nonfermenter Gram-negative bacilli have demonstrated increased levels of resistance. The significance of derepressed strains and of the recently described extended-spectrum, plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases to the usefulness of the third-generation cephalosporins is discussed.
