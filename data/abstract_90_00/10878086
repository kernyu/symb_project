Glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (GRE) from broilers and pigs were characterized to investigate the background for the persistence of GRE in pig herds. All porcine isolates belonged to closely related pulsed-field gel electrophoretic (PFGE) types, with the ermB and vanA genes located on the same transferable genetic element. Broiler isolates belonged to different PFGE types. The persistence of GRE in Danish pig herds after the ban of glycopeptides may be explained by the genetic link between ermB and vanA and coselection by use of macrolides for treatment and growth promotion.
