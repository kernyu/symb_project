The aim of this investigation was to study the possible emergence of resistant isolates of the genus Staphylococcus on the hands of dental personnel who use 'Hibiscrub' (chlorhexidine-detergent preparation) and cetyl pyridinium-coated gloves. Resistance was determined by a rate-of-kill technique. In four dental student groups (first, second, third and fourth years) no microorganisms survived 30 min exposure to cetyl pyridinium chloride (CPC) or to chlorhexidine diacetate (CDA). In a theatre staff group, no microorganisms survived 30 s exposure to CPC; and only one of 23 isolates survived 30 min exposure to CDA, but was killed after 60 min exposure. It is concluded that staphylococci resistant to either of these disinfectants do not present a problem in dental students or theatre staff.
