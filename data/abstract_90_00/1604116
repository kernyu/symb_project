A case of neurocysticercosis in a Zairian patient with clinical and neuro-radiological follow-up is reported. Treatment with praziquantel resulted in the regression of only some of the cysts. Subsequent treatment with albendazole was effective, eliminating most of the remaining lesions. This case illustrates a selective sensitivity of cysts to praziquantel and albendazole in a single patient.
