A Bacillus subtilis strain with the polynucleotide phosphorylase gene deleted was sensitive for growth in the presence of tetracycline. This strain was used to select for tetracycline-resistant mutants. A point mutation in the tetA(L) promoter and a spontaneously occurring tetA(L) gene copy number mutant were characterized.
