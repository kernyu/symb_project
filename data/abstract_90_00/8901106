A plasmid pLC-bar containing the bialaphos resistance gene derived from Streptomyces hygroscopicus between the Lentinus edodes ras gene promoter and priA gene terminator was constructed. When protoplasts of Pleurotus ostreatus were mixed with the plasmid DNA in the presence of polyethylene glycol and CaCl2, bialaphos-resistant colonies were obtained. This indicated that transformation was successful. Southern blot analysis of total DNAs from transformants showed that the introduced plasmid DNA was integrated into the host chromosome and partly rearranged. A plasmid, pLC-GUS, containing the Escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene under the control of the L. edodes ras gene promoter and priA gene terminator was constructed and introduced into protoplasts of P. ostreatus with pLC-bar by co-transformation. Two of 5 transformants obtained as bialaphos-resistant colonies showed two to twenty times higher specific activity of GUS than the recipient. Southern blot analysis of total DNAs from transformants indicated the presence of the GUS gene only in the two transformants. These results indicated that co-transformation of P. ostreatus was successful, and that the GUS gene was expressed in P. ostreatus. This transformation system will enable us to breed commercial strains of P. ostreatus at the molecular level.
