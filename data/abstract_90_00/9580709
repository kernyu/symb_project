Two positive and negative selectable markers were created for use in mammalian cells. They are based on two genes for the resistance to Blasticidin S (BlaS) and on the thymidine kinase (Tk) gene of herpes simplex virus (HSV). The markers can be selected positively by their ability to induce BlaS resistance and negatively on the induced sensitivity towards gancyclovir (GANC). Both constructs are also expressed in Escherichia coli and transfer BlaS resistance to this organism as well, making these markers very suitable for the construction of shuttle vectors.
