Changes in superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (C), and peroxidase (P) blood activity, as well as the activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH), isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), and peroxide resistance of erythrocytes (PRE) have been studied in 45 gastroenterologic patients under different types of general anesthesia. A significant increase in G-6-PDH, SOD, K, P activity and an increase in ICDH and MDH activity, as well as a drop in PRE which tends to return to baseline postoperatively have been established during general anesthesia. SOD expressed the greatest intergroup differences. A fragment of mechanism of energy transfer in the erythrocyte aimed at hemoglobin oxygenation and tissue hypoxia compensation has been suggested.
