Recently the duration of treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis in The Netherlands was shortened from nine to six months. A six months regimen containing isoniazid (H), rifampicin (R) and pyrazinamid (Z) daily for two months, followed by H and R daily for another four months (2HRZ/2HR) has been proven effective for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis, provided the cause is a fully susceptible strain of M. tuberculosis. Worldwide there is an increase in drug-resistant tuberculosis. Since at the start of treatment susceptibility tests often are not available, a fourth drug must be added in the intensive phase. Ethambutol is the drug preferred. This means that one always starts with 4 drugs unless the patient is a contact of an index-case with proven susceptibility and one is sure that he will be compliant or the patient is infected in the past before 1940, he received never tuberculostatic drugs and one is sure that there is no exogenous reinfection. If the patient has been treated previously and anti-tuberculosis drug resistance is likely, treatment regimens should contain at least two drugs with which he has not been treated before, while a fifth drug routinely must be added in the intensive phase. Amikacin is preferred, since there is no cross-resistance to streptomycin. Consensus on the duration of treatment for extra-pulmonary tuberculosis has not yet been reached, but basically the principles for treatment are the same. This is also true for HIV infected tuberculosis patients. In some serious clinical situations (meningitis, miliary, spine tb) duration of treatment still is 9-12 months. Early involvement of the public health nurse of the municipal health department (GGD) is necessary to ensure patient compliance and treatment supervision.
