Cyclosporin A (CsA) is an effective modulator of multidrug resistance (MDR) in vitro and in murine tumour systems in vivo. We now report the production of immunity to L1210 leukaemia by the addition of CsA to VP-16 therapy of leukaemic BDF/1 mice. VP-16/cyclosporin A tumour immunity induction arises as a consequence of active therapy independently of immunisation with modified tumour cells. The addition of CsA to VP-16 prolongs survival of BDF/1 host mice bearing L1210 leukaemia beyond that produced by equivalent dose VP-16 alone. A subpopulation of 60-day surviving mice after combined VP-16/CsA are immune to rechallenge with the same leukaemia inoculum to which they were originally exposed. Spleen cells from immune mice adoptively transfer anti-L1210 leukaemia immunity to untreated BDF/1 mice in a dose dependent, statistically significant manner. Adoptive transfer experiments additionally suggest active recruitment of immunologic response in recipient animals: (1) We have been able to perpetuate leukaemia immunity in four sequential cohorts of naive recipient mice. This propogation of adoptive immunity is accomplished by use of spleen cells harvested from each preceeding passively-protected animal cohort; (2) Cyclophosphamide pretreatment of adoptive transfer recipient mice abrogates the ability of their splenocytes to perpetuate passive protection in sequential adoptive transfer experiments.
