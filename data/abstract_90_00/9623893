This review article evaluates the role of local drug delivery systems in the management of periodontal diseases. The efficacy of several local delivery devices (i.e., tetracycline fibers, metronidazole and minocycline gels, chlorhexidine chips, and doxycycline polymer) which are either commercially available in the United States or abroad, or are currently under consideration for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval are discussed. The drug delivery systems are assessed with regard to their functional characteristics, effectiveness as a monotherapy, as compared to scaling and root planing, and ability to enhance conventional therapy. Furthermore, controversies associated with local delivery are addressed (e.g., induction of bacterial resistant strains, the efficacy of systemic versus local drug delivery, and whether local drug delivery should function as an alternative or as an adjunct to conventional treatment).
