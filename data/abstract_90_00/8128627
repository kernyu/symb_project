In this report, we provide evidence that the cellular thymidine kinase activity is required for the inhibition of HIV replication by zidovudine (AZT) in lymphocytes. The HSV-1 thymidine kinase protein is not able to substitute for the cellular enzyme, in accord with in vitro data that AZT is poorly phosphorylated by the HSV-derived activity.
