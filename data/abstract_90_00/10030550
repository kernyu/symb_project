Three cases of Clavispora lusitaniae invasive fungal infections are reported. All three infections appeared in cancer patients presented with fungaemia, one additionally with meningitis. Two of them were breakthrough -- they developed during therapy with conventional amphotericin B with a dose of 0.5 mg kg(-1) day(-1) . All three were cured: two with intravenous fluconazol and one with an increasing dose (1 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) of amphotericin B. In one of two breakthrough cases the sensitivity of the strain to antifungals was tested against antifungal agents and showed in vitro resistance to amphotericin B (MIC 2 eta g ml(-1)).
