Six cases of chronic tenosynovitis of the hand due to the Mycobacterium terrae complex were identified. All isolates from the six cases were identified as Mycobacterium nonchromogenicum by high-performance liquid chromatography and by testing for susceptibility to ofloxacin and to 5% NaCl. Ethambutol, sulfonamides (or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), erythromycin, and streptomycin are the drugs most active against isolates of the M. terrae complex, and therapy with some combination of these agents plus surgical debridement offers the best current treatment of this disease. This study supports the contention arising from previous case reports of pulmonary disease that M. nonchromogenicum is the pathogenic member of the M. terrae complex.
