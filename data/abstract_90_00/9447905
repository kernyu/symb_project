Two new fluoroquinolones (trovafloxacin and sparfloxacin) with enhanced activity against gram-positive pathogens and two earlier compounds (ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin) were tested for their in vitro inhibitory and bactericidal activity against 80 strains of Listeria monocytogenes. All strains were uniformly highly susceptible to trovafloxacin, the MIC90 being 0.25 mg/l. Resistance to sparfloxacin was not detected, however the MIC90 of sparfloxacin was eight times that of trovafloxacin. A few strains were resistant to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin (MIC90 4 mg/l for both drugs). MBCs usually exceeded MICs by 2 to 4 times. The MBC90 of trovafloxacin (1 mg/l) was lower than that of the other three drugs (8 mg/l). After checking their ability to enter and grow within human enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells, four strains were used to study the intracellular activity and eradicating power of the four quinolones. Trovafloxacin was more active than sparfloxacin and the earlier fluoroquinolones in terms of both intracellular killing and inhibition of a cytopathogenic effect. The uniform high-level activity of trovafloxacin against Listeria monocytogenes isolates in conventional in vitro assays and its extracellular and intracellular killing of invasive strains suggest that this and maybe other new fluoroquinolones should be further investigated as possible anti-listerial agents.
