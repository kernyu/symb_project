A novel porous active carbon is utilized in order to adsorb the diethylaminoethyl-dextran (DEAE-dextran)-enzyme stabilized complexes, for the construction of highly stable biosensors. The interaction of DEAE-dextran with the examined enzymes increases dramatically the operational stabilization of the sensors, without adverse effects on the enzyme activity. At the same time, the porous active carbon allows for high enzyme loading, good electrical contact and low resistance throughout the sensing element. Glucose oxidase and horseradish peroxidase are used as model enzymes in this study to construct biosensors, with very good reproducibility (less than 5% RSD). As a result, the glucose sensor exhibits very long operational stability (over a period of 5 months), while the hydrogen peroxide sensor retains its initial activity after several weeks.
