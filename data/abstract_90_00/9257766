The vanY gene of vancomycin-resistant enterococci encodes a D,D-carboxypeptidase. By using a PCR detection strategy, a VanA Enterococcus faecium clinical isolate was found to have an insertion sequence (IS)-like element designated IS1476 in vanY. The activity of the VanY D,D-carboxypeptidase in this isolate was decreased in a fluorometric fluoraldehyde o-phthalaldehyde assay with diacetyl-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala as the substrate. This, to our knowledge, is the first report of an IS-like element in a vancomycin resistance gene.
