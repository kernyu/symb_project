To study the effect of apoptosis on gene amplification, we have constructed HeLa S3 cell lines in which the expression of bcl-2 (BCL2) can be controlled by tetracycline in the growth medium. Induction of Bcl-2 expression caused a temporary delay of apoptosis and resulted in roughly a 3-fold increase in the frequency of resistant colonies when cells were selected with trimetrexate. This resistance was due to amplification of the dihydrofolate reductase gene. Cells grown out of the pooled resistant colonies retained the same level of resistance to trimetrexate whether Bcl-2 was induced or repressed, consistent with the theory that Bcl-2 functions by facilitating gene amplification, rather than being the resistance mechanism per se. Pretreating cells with aphidicolin is another method to increase gene amplification frequency. When Bcl-2-expressing cells were pretreated with aphidicolin, the resulting increase in gene amplification frequency was approximately the product of the increases caused by aphidicolin pretreatment or Bcl-2 expression alone, indicating that Bcl-2 increases gene amplification through a mechanism independent of that of aphidicolin pretreatment. These results are consistent with the concept that gene amplification occurs at a higher frequency during drug-induced cell cycle perturbation. Bcl-2 evidently increases the number of selected amplified colonies by prolonging cell survival during the perturbation.
