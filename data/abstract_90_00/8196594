The aim of this study is to clarify the early phase of acute rejection of the single lung transplantation by the pulmonary hemodynamics. Twenty dogs were divided into 3 groups (Group I (6 dogs): Modified autotransplantation, Group II (6): Allotransplantation without immunosuppression, Group III (8): Allotransplantation with immunosuppression (CYA 10mg/kg, AZ 2mg/kg)). Cardiac output (CO) and pulmonary arterial (PA) flow of the transplanted lung were measured continuously using Doppler flow method. In Group I, PA flow was maintained at about 40% of CO for 2 weeks. However, in Group II, PA flow gradually decreased to 15% of CO on the 7th postoperative day (POC) and all animals died of rejection within 2 weeks after surgery. In Group III, PA flow decreased to 20% of CO on the 1st POD but, then increased gradually to 38% on the 14th POD. When rejection was induced by discontinuation of CYA and AZ, PA flow decreased to below 13% of CO within 3.7 days (mean) and perivascular cuffing was found in open biopsy, although findings on chest X-ray films remained unchanged. PA flow returned to 40% within 4.3 days (mean) by injecting methylprednisolone for 3 days. In conclusion, the measurement of pulmonary hemodynamics might be useful in the early diagnosis of acute rejection after single lung transplantation.
