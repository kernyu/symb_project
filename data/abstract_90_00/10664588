Complementary biochemical and genetic approaches are being used to dissect the signaling network that regulates the innate immune response in plants. Receptor-mediated recognition of invading pathogens triggers a signal amplification loop that is based on synergistic interactions between nitric oxide, reactive oxygen intermediates and salicylic acid. Alternative resistance mechanisms in Arabidopsis are deployed against different types of pathogens; these mechanisms are mediated by either salicylic acid or the growth regulators jasmonic acid and ethylene.
