A bireplicone plasmid pSU901,4.6 kb in length, was constructed on the basis of plasmid pUC19 and the pstIB fragment, 1.9 kb in length, from mitochondrial DNA of A. chrysogenum. Based on the hybrid plasmid pSU901 and kanamycin resistance determinant, an autonomically replicating vector for A. chrysogenum, a culture producing cephalosporin C, is being constructed.
