We screened clinical isolates of tubercle bacillus for mutations in the pncA gene, which encodes pyrazinamidase (PZase), by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-direct sequencing method. Sixty-eight strains of tubercle bacillus were isolated from 32 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. The patients were treated with antituberculous agents including pyrazinamide (PZA) for 2 months. Thirty-two of the 68 strains were isolated from sputum samples collected from the patients before treatment; 29 strains and 7 strains were collected after 1 month and 2 months of treatment, respectively. The pncA genes in these strains, were assessed for mutations by direct sequencing of PCR products using an automated sequencer. Similarly, we examined two clinical isolates (ka567 and minami22) of tubercle bacillus, determined to be deficient in PZase activity by the Wayne method. A PZA-sensitive strain (H37Rv, ATCC27294), and a PZA-resistant strain (H37Rv-PZA-R, ATCC35828) were used as negative and positive controls for mutations in the pncA gene, respectively. None of the 68 strains demonstrated any mutations in the pncA gene; however, the 2 PZase-deficient strains had missense mutations in the pncA gene resulting in an amino acid substitution from His82 to Arg in clone ka567, and from Ala171 to Val in clone minami22.
