A case of anaerobic lung abscess who had treatment failure after 4 weeks of supervised parenteral penicillin and oral metronidazole is described. Anaerobic pathogens resistant to one or the other of the above drugs were isolated. The patient had a striking clinical response to subsequent therapy with oral clindamycin. Failure of therapy should alert physicians to the possibility of infection with resistant anaerobic pathogens and in such situations, clindamycin is considered as an effective alternative.
