In order to compare the resistance pattern to zidovudine plus lamivudine in zidovudine-experienced patients, we studied three HIV-1-infected patients enrolled in NUCB3004, an open-label trial. Over a 24-week follow-up, the patients were studied for drug sensitivity, reverse transcriptase genotype, viral load (HIV-1 RNA level) and viral phenotype (syncytium inducing (SI) or non-syncytium inducing). Virus isolates derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were tested for changes in drug susceptibility. Proviral DNA in the patients' PBMCs and RNA from plasma and culture supernatant were subjected to amplification and sequencing. All three HIV-1 strains showed a decreased susceptibility to either zidovudine or lamivudine after 24 weeks of therapy. The pattern of DNA genotypic resistance to lamivudine in patient A showed a mutation at codon 184 of the reverse transcriptase-encoding gene (methionine to valine). No HIV-1 strains with lamivudine-related mutations in proviral DNA were found among the isolates obtained from patients B and C. In these two patients, the mutation at codon 184 of the reverse transcriptase-encoding gene appeared in RNA, both in plasma and in culture supernatant. Viral phenotyping revealed the maintenance of the SI phenotype at week 24. Two out of the three patients experienced a reduction in HIV-1 RNA levels after 24 weeks of therapy, and in two out of three there was a rebound in viral load at week 28 together with the onset of the codon 184 mutation in RNA. The degree of phenotypic resistance to both zidovudine and lamivudine correlated with the amino acid changes in RNA and the rapid increase in viral load.
