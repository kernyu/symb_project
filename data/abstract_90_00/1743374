The antimicrobial susceptibility of Haemophilus ducreyi varies according to the geographic region. Increased resistance to trimethoprim and/or sulfamethoxazole led the Centers for Disease Control to recommend 250 mg ceftriaxone as a single intramuscular dose for chancroid. Intravenous or muscular routes of administration result in equivalent bioavailability. To avoid side effects such as syringe abscess and lidocaine intolerance, we prefer intravenous ceftriaxone therapy. The efficacy of this regimen is reported in 3 cases of chancroid. The intravenous administration of 1 g of ceftriaxone in chancroid seems to be as effective as administration by the intramuscular route, but it may lower the risk of syringe abscess, lidocaine intolerance and the emergence of resistant strains.
