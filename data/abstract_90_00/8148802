The relationship between an effective concentration and the duration of exposure to antiseptics was evaluated in strains of Staphylococcus aureus with a known genetic background, which include methicillin-resistant strains, using a modified version of the phenol coefficient method as part of an effort to investigate the antiseptic resistance of S. aureus. Chlorhexidine digluconate killed an antiseptic-sensitive strain within 1.5 min at 22 degrees C at a standard concentration (0.1%), whereas resistant strains still survived after 1.5 min. Povidone-iodine killed the sensitive strain within 1.5 min at a concentration of 0.1%, whereas it took this agent 3.0 and 4.5 min to kill low- and high-level resistant strains, respectively, at a concentration of 0.8%. These results indicate that the modified phenol coefficient method used is suitable for the evaluation of the sensitivity of microorganisms to antiseptics. An antiseptic-resistant chain that was associated with the ebr gene exhibited cross-resistance to povidone-iodine.
