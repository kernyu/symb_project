Structures and physico-chemical properties of 100 naphthoquinone metabolites produced by filamentous fungi are reviewed. The conditions of pigment formation, biogenesis and the mechanism of biosynthesis of pigments by fungi are described. Sixty-three fungi cultures able to produce naphthoquinone are listed. The biological activities of the main pigments and the mechanism of fungal resistance to their own metabolites are described. The physiological role of the naphthoquinones in producers is discussed.
