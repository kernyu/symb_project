Ampicillin-sulbactam and cefoperazone-sulbactam were tested against staphylococci that were collected from 40 different medical centers throughout the United States. Oxacillin-resistant strains were resistant to both drug combinations, but oxacillin-susceptible strains were uniformly susceptible. The latter included strains with borderline susceptibility to oxacillin and methicillin.
