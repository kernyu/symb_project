A sixteen year old female was feverish from June 12, 1993. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from the blood, the diagnosis of MRSA sepsis was established. Vancomycin (2 g/day) was administered for eighteen days, but MRSA was not eradicated in the blood culture. Then she was administered a combination therapy of arbekacin (200 mg/day) and imipenem/cilastain (1 g/day) for seven days, but MRSA in the blood was cultured continuously. The sequential combination therapy of netilmycin (200 mg/day) and minocycline (200 mg/day) was started, MRSA was eradicated from the blood culture after four days. The sequential combination therapy netilmycin and minocycline was seemed to be effective for MRSA infection.
