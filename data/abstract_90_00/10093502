Transgenic mice were produced to study the expression of amino-3' glycosyl phosphotransferase gene (neomycin resistance gene) in the embryonic fibroblast cells. A 1.9 Kb linear fragment of neomycin resistance gene under the control of pPGK promoter was microinjected into the pronucleus of mouse embryos. Out of 64 potential founders born, 5 were identified to be transgenic by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and southern hybridization. Multiple mice from first and second generation from two transgenic founders (N-10 and N-32) were analysed to determine the germline transmission. It was found to be 24.6 and 71.4% in first and second generation respectively. Results were also further confirmed by RT-PCR, sequencing and in vitro bioassays.
