A field trial was conducted to compare the efficacy of the original and two modified formulations of Victory and oxytetracycline among dairy cows affected with papillomatous digital dermatitis. Seventy-eight cows with papillomatous digital dermatitis lesions were randomly allocated to one of four treatment groups (A, B, C, D). Cows in group A (n = 19) were treated with an oxytetracycline solution; cows in group B (n = 22) were treated with the original formulation of Victory containing soluble copper, peroxide compound, and a cationic agent; cows in group C (n = 17) were treated with a modified formulation of Victory containing reduced soluble copper and peroxide compound but increased levels of cationic agent; and cows in group D (n = 20) were treated with a modified formulation of Victory containing levels of soluble copper and cationic agent equivalent to the original formulation but with reduced concentrations of peroxide compound. Cows were examined 7, 14 and 28 d after initial treatment; during each examination, pain and lesion scores were recorded. The modified nonantibiotic formulation used in cows in group C appeared to be the most effective for treatment of papillomatous digital dermatitis. Proportions of cows with signs of pain were significantly lower among cows in group C, compared with cows in group A. Similarly, pain scores were significantly lower among cows in treatment group C, compared to cows in group A. The 2 low efficacy of oxytetracycline was an unexpected result b and may have clinical implications associated with possible antibiotic resistance in dairy cows affected with papillomatous digital dermatitis.
