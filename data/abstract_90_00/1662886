Published reports on the in vitro activity of temafloxacin indicate its activity against gram-positive cocci is equal to or slightly greater than that of ciprofloxacin, and generally twofold greater than that of ofloxacin. The few ciprofloxacin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains reported were also resistant to temafloxacin. Because temafloxacin achieves higher plasma and tissue levels than ciprofloxacin, greater differences between minimal inhibitory concentrations and tissue levels occur with temafloxacin than with ciprofloxacin, which may provide temafloxacin with greater therapeutic efficiency against gram-positive coccal infections.
