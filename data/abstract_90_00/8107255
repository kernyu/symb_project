The susceptibility to alpha/beta interferon (IFN-alpha/beta) or to gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) of various lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) strains was evaluated in C57BL/6 mice and in various cell lines. Anti-IFN-gamma treatment in vivo revealed that the LCMV strains Armstrong, Aggressive, and WE were most susceptible to IFN-gamma whereas Traub, Cl 13-Armstrong, and Docile were resistant. The same pattern of susceptibility to recombinant IFN-gamma was observed in vitro. In vivo treatment with anti-IFN-alpha/beta showed a sizeable increase in replication of Aggressive, Armstrong, and WE; effects were less pronounced for Docile, Cl 13-Armstrong, or Traub. Correspondingly, WE, Armstrong, and Aggressive were all relatively sensitive to purified IFN-alpha/beta in vitro, and Cl 13-Armstrong, Docile, and Traub were more resistant. Overall, there was a good correlation between the capacity of LCMV strains to establish a persistent infection in adult immunocompetent mice and their relative resistance to IFN-gamma and IFN-alpha/beta.
