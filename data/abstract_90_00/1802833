The primary antibacterial effect of betalactam antibiotics is due to the inhibition of cell-wall synthesis. Prerequisites for good antibacterial activity of such an antibiotic are --rapid penetration across the bacterial cell wall, --strong binding to the proper targets in the cytoplasmic membrane, i.e. the penicillin-binding proteins, --resistance to betalactamases which may be produced by the bacterial cell.
