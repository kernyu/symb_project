A transformation system has been developed for the pathogen fungus Botrytis cinerea, based on the utilization of the wide host plasmid pUT737 that contains the Sh ble gene, conferring resistance to phleomycin. Transformed protoplasts were regenerated at 10-25 micrograms ml(-1) of phleomycin, at a frequency of 25-40 transformants per microgram of DNA, and they were resistant up to 50 micrograms ml(-1). Southern hybridization using undigested and digested total DNA showed the presence of circular autonomously replicating plasmid pUT737 in the transformants. Reisolated plasmid from transformed fungus transformed E. coli and rescued plasmid was identified as PUT737. Transformants were grown for four generations under non-selective conditions and replicative plasmids were still detected. Plasmids present in all transformants at this stage had been modified from native pUT737 and showed the same size and configuration indicating that selection through stabilizing plasmid forms has happened.
