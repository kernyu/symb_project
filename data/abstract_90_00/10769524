OBJECTIVE: To evaluate, record and analyse the comparative activity of a range of oral antibiotics against Streptococcus pneumoniae. SETTING: Specimen collected at a private laboratory and some received from different hospitals and clinics. MATERIALS: The specimen comprised of Sputum, Throat Swabs, C.S.F., Pus, Pleural fluid, Ear Swabs, Eye Swabs, Bronchial Wash, Prostatic discharge and Antral Secretions. METHODS: The isolates were tested for their antibiotic susceptibility using the E-test by the methods described in the study protocol. The groups of antibiotics tested were Amoxicillin--Clavulanate, Clarithromycin, Cefaclor, Cefuroxime, Ceftriaxone and Penicillin. RESULTS: A total of 116 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae were isolated and susceptibility to Amoxicillin-Clavulanate was 100%, 99.1% strains were susceptible to Cefuroxime and 0.9% were intermediate. Susceptibility to Penicillin was 80.2% and 19.8% of the strains were in intermediate category, while susceptibility to Clarithromycin was 89.7%, 1.7% were in intermediate region and 8.6% of the strains were resistant to this antibiotic. The susceptibility pattern of Cefaclor was not calculated as there is no current NCCLS--97 Cefaclor breakpoints available. CONCLUSION: The percentage of drug resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae was negligible in Karachi during the study period, however it is important to monitor the susceptibility pattern to keep a check on an increase in the number of DRSP as reported at different centres in Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Thailand, Hong Kong and Indonesia.
