Ways for increasing antibiotic therapy efficacy in newborns are discussed. They are the following: consideration of the structure of the antibiotic use, improvement of infection diagnosis, the use of computers in epidemiological supervision of antibiotic resistance, the use of "old" antibiotics in new dosage forms, pharmacokinetic monitoring. The data on the frequency of the antibiotic use in newborns in maternity hospitals, at home and in neonatal departments as well as on diagnosis and treatment of chlamydiosis in newborns are presented. Requirements to the computer programs on control of antibiotic resistance are described. With the account of the requirements an original epidemiological program for personal computers was developed. The results of the pharmacokinetic monitoring of the use of sisomicin and amikacin are presented as well.
