BACKGROUND: Since 1991, a massive cholera epidemic started in Peru and involved most Central and South American Countries. In Chile, 147 cases were registered, the last one in 1995. AIM: To study the phenotypic and molecular features of Vibrio cholerae strains isolated from patients in Peru, Bolivia and Chile and from environmental reservoirs in Santiago, Chile. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The phenotype, biotype and susceptibility to nine antimicrobials was determined for each isolated strain. Also, the genes of cholera and termolabile toxins were determined using DNA probes and a chromosomal restriction profile was done using HindIII, EcoRI and NotI enzymes. RESULTS: Features studied were similar in the 53 strains isolated from patients. Those isolated from environmental reservoirs had different antimicrobial susceptibility, showing ampicillin resistance, and the GT gene was detected in one of 20 strains, compared to clinical samples were it was present in all. Strains isolated from patients and environment had similar chromosomal restriction profiles. CONCLUSIONS: The chromosomal restriction profile gives an image of bacterial genome and it is a useful and reliable tool for the epidemiological surveillance of cholera.
