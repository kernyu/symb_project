MICs of various beta-lactam antibiotics by themselves and in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitor (clavulanic acid) against extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae which were isolated from clinical materials were investigated. Furthermore, based on the results obtained, a procedure to detect ESBL producing strains was proposed. The MICs of beta-lactam antibiotics against beta-lactamase producing strains were investigated. At first, beta-lactamase was investigated by the drug sensitivity pattern (MIC) to beta-lactam antibiotics and by the substrate profiles of beta-lactamase extracted from the transconjugant of E. coli K-12 strains. After that, we classified the beta-lactamase producing gene by PCR method. Furthermore, a proposal was made for an antibiotic to be used in the confirmation of mixed type beta-lactamase. The data obtained by the above investigations were compiled and used to determine the limit concentration of each beta-lactam against beta-lactamase producing strains including ESBL. By using beta-lactam antibiotics at the following concentrations, it is considered possible to classify beta-lactamase; ampicillin (64 micrograms/ml), ampicillin/clavulanic acid (32/5 micrograms/ml), piperacillin (64 micrograms/ml), cefotaxime (1 microgram/ml), cefpodoxime (2 micrograms/ml), ceftazidime (1 microgram/ml), cefmetazole (4 micrograms/ml), cefminox (2 micrograms/ml), cefepime (0.5 microgram/ml), aztreonam (1 microgram/ml) and imipeneme (1 microgram/ml). This method may be used as a reference in investigating the prevalence of beta-lactam resistant isolates by ESBL producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae.
