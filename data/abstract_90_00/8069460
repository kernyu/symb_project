Mycoplasmal contamination remains a significant impediment to the culture of eukaryotic cells. For certain cultures, attempts to eliminate the infection are feasible alternatives to the normally recommended disposal of the contaminated culture. Here, three antibiotic regimens for mycoplasmal decontamination were compared in a large panel of naturally infected cultures: a 1-wk treatment with the fluoroquinolone mycoplasma removal agent (MRA), a 2-wk treatment with the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin, and three rounds of a sequential 1-wk treatment with BM-Cyclin containing tiamulin and minocyclin. These antibiotic treatments had a high efficiency of permanent cure: MRA 69%, ciprofloxacin 75%, BM-Cyclin 87%. Resistance to mycoplasma eradication was observed in some cell cultures: BM-Cyclin 0%, MRA 20%, ciprofloxacin 20%. Nearly all resistant contaminants that could be identified belonged to the species Mycoplasma arginini and M. orale. Detrimental effects of the antibiotics were seen in the form of culture death caused by cytotoxicity (in 5 to 13% of the cultures). Alterations of the cellular phenotypic features or selective clonal outgrowth might represent further untoward side effects of exposure to these antibiotics. Overall, antibiotic decontamination of mycoplasmas is an efficient, inexpensive, reliable, and simple method: 150/200 (75%) chronically and heavily contaminated cultures were cured and 50/200 (25%) cultures could not be cleansed and were either lost or remained infected. It is concluded that eukaryotic cell cultures containing mycoplasmas are amenable to antibiotic treatment and that a cure rate of three-quarters is a reasonable expectation.
