Most methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains produce beta-lactamase. To determine whether this enzyme(s) is identical to one or more of the four beta-lactamases produced by methicillin-susceptible strains, the beta-lactamases of 50 MRSA isolates were typed by using substrate profile analysis. Forty type A, no type B, ten type C, and no type D beta-lactamase-producing strains were identified. The beta-lactamase inhibitor sulbactam reduced the MICs of beta-lactamase-labile antibiotics, including ampicillin, penicillin G, and cefazolin, for type A and type C MRSA strains.
