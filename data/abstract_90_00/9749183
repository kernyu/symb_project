The diagnosis of a communication between the left ventricle and right atrium was made by transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiography in a 67 year old man with a recurrence of a methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infectious endocarditis complicating aortic valve replacement with a bioprosthesis seven weeks previously. This diagnosis was confirmed at surgery; the left ventricular-right atrial communication was closed by suturing its edges and a new aortic valve prosthesis was implanted. Unfortunately, the patient died 4 months later of myocardial dysfunction although the infectious endocarditis seemed to have been sterilised by antibiotic therapy. Doppler echocardiography, especially using the transoesophageal approach is the best diagnostic method for rare complications of infectious endocarditis, usually of the aortic valve, the prognosis of which is improved by early surgery and appropriate antibiotic therapy for the causal organisms.
