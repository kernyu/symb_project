We studied the efficacy of NY-198 (Lomefloxacin), a new quinolone derivatives, in the 46 cases of non-gonorrhoeae urethritis. NY-198 was mainly administered in doses of 600 mg three times a day for 7-14 days. The clinical and bacteriological effects of N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis were already reported from many other authors, so we mainly summarized the cases of U. urealyticum. The 21 cases of isolated U. urealyticum, 19 cases of C. trachomatis and 2 cases of N. gonorrhoeae were all eradicated after this treatment. We concluded that NY-198 was a very useful drug for sexually transmitted disease.
