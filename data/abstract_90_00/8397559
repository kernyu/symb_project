A case of primary cutaneous aspergillosis in a very low birthweight infant that responded to medical therapy is reported. Knowledge of the potential pathogenic role of this organism in neonatal skin lesions is important because of resistance to standard empirical antibacterial therapy and the potential for dissemination and deep parenchymal invasion. Surgical excision may be necessary if cutaneous aspergillosis progresses despite systemic antifungal therapy.
