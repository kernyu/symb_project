Between 1983 and 1991, 465 gonococcal strains isolated in the urological department of Japanese Red Cross Medical Center. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of these isolates to 22 kinds of antibiotics including penicillins (PC), cephems, tetracyclins (TC) and new quinolons (NQ) were determined and the annual difference of MIC was studied. The annual incidence of penicillinase producing neisseria gonorrhoeae (PPNG) of these 9 years were distributed in 3 to 17% and increasing tendency was not observed. As for Penicillin G, the MIC 90 of PPNG was seven fold higher than that of non-PPNG. No remarked difference was observed between MIC 90 of Cephems, TC and NQ of PPNG and non-PPNG. No annual difference was observed in MIC of PC, Cephems and SPCM. However the rising tendency of MIC was observed in NQ.
