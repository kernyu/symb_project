We experienced 20 cases of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection from April 1991 to September 1992. Of them, 9 showed substantial morbidity and their clinical courses are herein reported. The clinical presentations of these cases were wound infection and enterocolitis. Although in 8 cases MRSA was eradicated in 14 to 160 days by effective antibiotics administration, one had a fatal outcome. All strains isolated showed similar drug-sensitivity pattern suggesting hospital infection. Sensitivity to vancomycin and arbekacin, however, remained high and these drugs were effective clinically. It should be stressed that treatment strategy of MRSA infection should consist of isolation of patients with MRSA from other patients, use of disposable equipment and products, and serious and continuing concerns of medical personal on communicability of MRSA.
