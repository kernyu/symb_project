We studied 961 clinical Salmonella isolates (one per patient) seen in one Spanish hospital from 1988 to 1991. The incidence of non-Salmonella typhi Salmonella infections per 100,000 admissions increased from 3.93 to 5.98. Overall rates of resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and co-trimoxazole were 32, 11, and 2%, respectively. Resistance to chloramphenicol increased from 9 to 16% during the study period, while resistance to each of the other drugs remained stable. Variations related to serogroups were observed.
