Twelve volunteers received 300 mg of clindamycin intravenously (i.v.) or orally (p.o.) administered every 8 h (q8h) or q12h by random assignment over four study periods. Serum bactericidal titers were determined for each regimen against two isolates each of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae (one penicillin-sensitive isolate and one penicillin-resistant isolate), and Bacteroides fragilis. The duration of measurable bactericidal activity over the dosing interval (expressed as a percentage of the dosing interval) was determined for each isolate. No significant differences in the duration of activity were observed between i.v. and p.o. regimens dosed according to the same interval (P > 0.05). All regimens provided bactericidal activity against S. pneumoniae for 100% of their respective dosing intervals. Against B. fragilis, bactericidal activity was observed for greater than 80% of the dosing interval for each of the regimens. Although a statistically significant difference favoring the q8h i.v. regimen (P < 0.05) was detected, this difference is not believed to be clinically significant. The q8h and q12h regimens provided measurable bactericidal activity against S. aureus for greater than 85 and 50% of the dosing intervals, respectively (P < 0.001). Clindamycin dosed at 300 mg i.v. or p.o., q8h or q12h, provides adequate coverage against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and B. fragilis.
