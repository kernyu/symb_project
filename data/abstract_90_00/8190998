The role of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) in childhood diarrhoea in New Caledonia was demonstrated in previous epidemiological works. This study was undertaken in order to characterize these strains and to determine whether bacterial components of current vaccine candidates (toxin, colonization factor antigens, O:H antigens) would be useful in our region. A total of 24 ETEC strains were studied: 5 strains produced heat-labile enterotoxin, 17 strains produced heat-stable enterotoxin (9 STp and 8 STh), and 2 strains produced both toxins (1 LT/STp/STh and 1 LT/STh). E. coli strains were screened for the presence of genes encoding for enterotoxins (DNA dot blot and Southern hybridization assays); results obtained with probes were closely correlated and were in agreement with biological assays. No two ETEC strains possessed similar plasmid profiles, and DNA sequences encoding for enterotoxins were located on plasmids ranging from 58 to 75 MDa. The O:H (O1:H-,O2:H7, O6:H16, O25:H-, O27:H7, O28ab:H9, O52:H10, O64:H5, O70:H-, O78:H12, O88:H25, O99:H6, O101:H-, O126:H12, O166:H30) serotypes are presented (all the strains were typable, but some ETEC serotypes were unusual). By using antisera against colonization factor antigens (CFA) I and II, results showed that 9 of the 24 ETEC strains expressed CFA (2 CFA/II and 7 CFA/I). These strains possessed high bacterial surface hydrophobicity. Fifteen ETEC did not possess CFA; among these, 11 did not exhibit high hydrophobicity or show haemagglutination activity. Four of the 15 CFA-negative strains exhibited high hydrophobicity (two O64:H45, one O70:H- and one O88:H25) but no haemagglutination in the presence or absence of mannose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
