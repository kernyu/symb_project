The emergence of resistance to pharmacologic antimicrobial agents and the desire to increase chemotherapy dose-intensity have necessitated the search for alternative means to control infectious disease. Enhancement of host immunity against infection has been permitted through the use of hematopoietic growth factors, which can shorten the duration of neutropenia and reduce the risk for bacterial and fungal infections. Hematopoietic growth factor-mobilized hematopoietic stem cells have also proven to be highly efficacious in permitting high-dose chemotherapy. Interferons, immunoregulatory cytokines, immune globulins, and immune lymphocytes also hold promise to enhance host immunity and reduce susceptibility for serious infectious morbidity.
