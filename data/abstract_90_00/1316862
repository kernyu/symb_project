A novel TEM-derived plasmid-encoded beta-lactamase, resistant to inhibition by clavulanic acid, has been identified in a clinical strain of Escherichia coli found in Scotland. The beta-lactamase gene was carried on an 81-kb plasmid that conferred no other resistances. The novel enzyme conferred resistance to the amoxycillin/clavulanic acid combination on the host bacterium. The beta-lactamase has a pI of 5.25 and lies between the PSE-4 and SAR-1 beta-lactamases on an isoelectric focusing gel. This beta-lactamase has a Mr value of 25,000, similar to the TEM-1 enzyme and a comparable substrate profile. Its most significant difference is that it is inhibited by clavulanic acid 100-fold less efficiently than the TEM-1 enzyme. The enzyme was confirmed to be derived from the TEM enzymes by probing the plasmid DNA with an intragenic gene probe for TEM-1. This is the first report of a clinical bacterium carrying a TEM-enzyme that confers resistance to clavulanic acid combinations and we have designated the beta-lactamase as TRC-1.
