Patients receiving chemotherapy for acute leukemia were prospectively followed up to determine the frequency, nature and outcome, of episodes of infection during a 6 or 12 month period at each of the participating centres. A total of 605 cycles of chemotherapy were surveyed. Of these, 490 cycles were received by patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 115 by patients with acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL). 241 episodes of infection were recorded during the survey: 179 among ALL patients and 62 among patients of ANLL. Infections were more common during chemotherapy for ANLL than for ALL, occurring in 54% (62/115) and 36% (179/490) of chemotherapeutic cycle respectively. A favorable response to empiric antibacterial agents was seen in 39% (23/59) of episodes in ANLL patients and 77% (134/174) of episodes among ALL patients. Infection presented as fever of unidentified origin in an overwhelming majority (63%) of episodes. Gastroenteritis and pneumonia occurred with a frequency of 11% and 10% while the frequency of all other diagnoses was 3% or less. Overall, E coli and Candida were the most frequently isolated organisms while Staphylococcus aureus and Group A Streptococci were the most frequent isolates from blood and throat swabs, respectively. A high degree of resistance to commonly used antimicrobial agents was seen among the most frequently isolated organisms. About 75% of episodes of infection which did not respond to antibacterial agents responded to empiric systemic antifungal therapy; although fungi were mycologically isolated in only a quarter of these instances. Oropharyngeal candidiasis occurred in association with 3% of chemotherapeutic cycles.
