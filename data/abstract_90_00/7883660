One hundred cases of Indian Kala-azar unresponsive to sodium stibogluconate (SSG) were treated with amphotericin B. The drug was given in the dose schedule of 0.75 mg/kg body weight on alternate days intravenously dissolved in 5 percent dextrose solution. After 15 infusions given over a period of 30 days, all cases became clinically and parasitologically cured. Mild adverse reactions were noted during therapy. No relapse was observed at follow up after 12 months.
