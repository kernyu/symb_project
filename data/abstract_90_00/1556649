A strain of Plasmodium vivax from Indonesia was adapted to splenectomized Aotus and Saimiri monkeys and tested for its susceptibility to chloroquine. Animals were infected by intravenous inoculation of heparinized parasitized blood and subsequently treated with 8 or 15 mg (base) of chloroquine by oral intubation. Recrudescence of infection occurred in 4 of 4 Aotus and 5 of 6 Saimiri monkeys treated with 15 mg base of chloroquine, indicating a level of resistance between that of the standard Chesson strain of P. vivax and the recently reported resistant strains from Papua New Guinea.
