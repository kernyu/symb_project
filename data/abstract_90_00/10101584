Interferon beta 1b is now an established therapeutic option for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. More recently, it has also been shown to slow down disease progression in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Interferon beta 1b's clinical effect is reflected in MRI studies demonstrating a dramatic effect in reducing disease activity. The drug is generally well tolerated, but its efficacy can be compromised in some patients by the emergence of neutralizing antibodies. This chapter will focus on interferon beta 1b (Betaseron) treatment for multiple sclerosis, its clinical and MRI effects, and its putative mechanism of action.
