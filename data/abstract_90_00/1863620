The evolution of antimicrobial susceptibility of Bacteroides fragilis over a five year period is described. We have studied 30 selected strains isolated each year at the University Hospital of Sevilla (total: 150 strains). We did not find any resistant strain to chloramphenicol, metronidazole or imipenem. Resistance to piperacillin (8%) and cefoxitin (13%) remain constant over the study period. Resistance to cefmetazole, cefotaxime, mezlocillin, ofloxacin, clindamycin and moxalactam ranges from 24% to 37%. A rise in the percentage of resistant strains to ticarcillin (from 17% to 30%) and ceftizoxime (from 0% to 40%) was also seen during the study period. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron was the overall more resistant species, and B. fragilis the more sensitive.
