A French multicentre study was conducted in 15 Infectious Diseases departments; 347 cases of severe staphylococcal infections were collected during one year (October 1989 to October 1990): Two-hundred and fifty-eight strains were analysed with complementary bacteriological studies, including 62 strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Epidemiological, clinical and therapeutic aspects were investigated. Nosocomial infection was responsible for 90 percent of the cases, and previous antibiotic therapy was reported in 74 percent. An invasive procedure was incriminated in 43 patients (69 percent); intravenous catheter (38 percent), mechanical ventilation (31 percent), surgery (22 percent), prosthetic device (20 percent). Thirty-nine patients were treated with glycopeptides either alone or in combination with beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, fucidic acid, fosfomycin, rifampicin, quinolones or synergistines, showing the great diversity in the choice of antibiotics in methicillin-resistant S. aureus infections. More than 90 percent of these strains were resistant to gentamicin and quinolones, 80 percent of clindamycin and 70 percent to rifampicin. No resistance to glycopeptides (vancomycin or teicoplanin) was observed. Prognosis was severe, with a mortality rate of 35 percent, justifying educational and prophylactic measures in at risk medical departments.
