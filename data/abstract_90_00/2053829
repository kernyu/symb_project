Condensation of rubomycin (daunorubicin) with respective hydrazides yielded novel substituted hydrazones: 13-cyanoacetyl hydrazone rubomycin, 13-L-phenylalanyl hydrazone rubomycin, 13-BOC-3-(uracilyl-1)-DL-alanyl hydrazone rubomycin and 13-BOC-3-(adenylyl-9)-DL-alanyl hydrazone rubomycin. With successive treatment of rubomycin with hydrazine hydrate and respective ketones novel asymmetric azines were prepared: 13-cyclopentylidene hydrazone rubomycin, 13-alpha,alpha'-dimethyl-cyclopentylidene hydrazone rubomycin and 13-(1-phenylethylidene-1) hydrazone rubomycin. 14-Adenylyl-N9-rubomycin was synthesized by interaction of 14-bromorubomycin with adenine and hydrogenation of its analog, 14-N-imidazolyl rubomycin by sodium borhydrite yielded 13-dihydro-14-N-imidazolyl rubomycin. There was observed correlation between the antimicrobial activity of the derivatives against B. mycoides and their cytostatic effect on the cells of murine leukemia NK/LI. The high in vitro activity of 13-cyclopentylidene hydrazone rubomycin showed satisfactory correlation with the results of the study on the antitumor effect in animals.
