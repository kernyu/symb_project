ICR mice were inoculated intranasally with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) N133, and the inoculated MRSA was quantitatively recovered from the ceca and feces. The viable counts of the MRSA recovered from ceca correlated well with those from feces. Some mice eliminated MRSA from the cecum by 14 days after inoculation. Intraperitoneal administration of cyclophosphamide at a dose of 200 mg/kg 3 days before inoculation inhibited the elimination of the MRSA from both ceca and feces. All mice treated with cyclophosphamide excreted more than 10(4) CFU of the MRSA per g of feces for at least 70 days, indicating persistent colonization of the MRSA in the gastrointestinal tract. Some beta-lactam antibiotics decreased the colonization level, but others did not. The colonization level was suggested to depend on the antibacterial activity of the antibiotic against the MRSA and the degree of disturbance of intestinal flora by the antibiotic.
