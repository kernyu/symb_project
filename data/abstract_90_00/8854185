Salmonella isolates from 295 layer and 294 broiler flocks in Canada were examined to determine resistance to antimicrobial agents, plasmid profiles, biochemical properties, and susceptibility to polyvalent bacteriophages. Except for the high number of strains resistant to spectinomycin (97.8%), the frequency of drug resistance of Salmonella isolates from layer flocks was low. None of 457 isolates from layer flocks was resistant to amikacin or ciprofloxacin, and less than 2% of the strains were resistant to cephalothin, chloramphenicol, cotrimoxazole, gentamicin, kanamycin, neomycin, nitrofurantoin, and/or polymyxin B. About 3% of the strains were resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin and/or tetracycline, whereas 8% of the strains were resistant to sulfisoxazole. Salmonella anatum var. O15+ and S. typhimurium var. copenhagen strains were resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents. None of 1159 Salmonella strains from broiler flocks was resistant to amikacin, cephalothin, ciprofloxacin or polymyxin B, less than 1% of the strains were resistant to chloramphenicol, 2% were resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin and/or chloramphenicol; 5-7% were resistant to the aminoglycosides gentamicin, kanamycin and/or neomycin; 6% were resistant to nitrofurantoin; 10% to tetracycline; 14% to sulfisoxazole; and 99% to spectinomycin. A high percentage of S. binza, S. anatum var. O15+, S. schwarzengrund and S. heidelberg strains were resistant to antimicrobial agents. Some of the single or multiple resistances were encoded by conjugative plasmids or by plasmids that were thermosensitive for transfer. Eight percent of S. heidelberg strains did not produce hydrogen sulfide. Ninety-seven percent of the Salmonella strains were susceptible to the lytic effect of polyvalent bacteriophages.
