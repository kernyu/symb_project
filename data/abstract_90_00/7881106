The basis for the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy as a tool to study the metabolism of breast cancer cells is described. The differences between proton (1H), carbon (13C), and phosphorus (31P) NMR methods is explained, and the techniques of cell extracts, cell suspensions and perfusion methods for cells are detailed. In order to perfuse cells they are preferably trapped in a gel matrix, either in the form of a thread or a bead. The gel must have appropriate properties that enables efficient oxygenation and availability of nutrients and drugs. The metabolic effects of perfusion of breast cancer cells with nutrients, drugs, and hormones are reported, and the clinical relevance of these results and methods are outlined.
