Methods to enhance mammary resistance to bacterial infection and to reduce the effects of existing infections without the use of antimicrobial agents are becoming more attractive, primarily because of increasing pressure from consumers and regulatory agencies to decrease the risk of drug residues in milk. Because of the difficulty in obtaining satisfactory results with existing drug formulations, new approaches in the treatment of mastitis should emphasize better understanding of mammary gland pharmacokinetics, ameliorating the pathologic effects of infection, and enhancing natural defenses. Efficacy studies should emphasize milk production and long-term survival of cows to allow economic evaluations.
