The MIC of lomefloxacin was determined for 554 isolates from the urinary tract. Some of the more resistant strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied in a dynamic in-vitro model in order to study dosing strategies. The model simulated, in Mueller-Hinton broth, the profile of plasma lomefloxacin concentrations in volunteers. Bacteria were exposed to a range of lomefloxacin concentration profiles achievable by oral dosing. The first dose of lomefloxacin was rapidly bactericidal in a dose-dependent manner for all strains. On re-exposure, a dose-dependent inhibitory effect was observed. Drug-resistant mutants were readily isolated from all bacteria tested on lomefloxacin-containing plates. These occurred at a high frequency in P. aeruginosa (10(-1)), but less frequently in K. pneumoniae (10(-3)). P. mirabilis (10(-5)), and E. coli (10(-6)). The number of resistant mutants isolated tended to be lower with use of higher drug concentrations. The results suggest that lomefloxacin dosing regimens ensuring maintenance of a high serum concentration: MIC ratio will result in maximal antibacterial effects and minimal problems with resistant strains.
