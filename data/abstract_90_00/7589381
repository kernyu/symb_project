The role of non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae in cystic fibrosis (CF) remains unclear. We wanted, therefore, to determine the presence and characteristics of non-typeable H. influenzae in sputum samples from patients with CF. In order to do this, we have assessed sputum samples from 55 consecutive clinically stable patients seen routinely at an adult CF out-patient clinic. Quantitative bacterial culture was performed using a selective media containing cefsoludin, and isolates were characterized by biotyping and outer membrane protein profile analysis. In 17 (30%) of these samples, non-typeable H. influenzae was isolated and was present in similar viable numbers (mean 7.7 x 10(8) colony-forming units (cfu).mL-1; SEM 3.1) to Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mean 8 x 10(8) cfu.mL-1: SEM 2.4). All non-typeable H. influenzae isolates recovered were beta-lactamase negative and sensitive to a range of antibiotics. Several biotypes and outer membrane protein profiles were observed, with no apparent association between these two phenotypic characteristics. The study showed that large numbers of non-typeable H. influenzae are often present in sputum from adult patients with CF. Further longitudinal studies of outer-membrane protein profile analysis are required to determine the dynamics of non-typeable H. influenzae colonization in individual patients and the clinical significance.
