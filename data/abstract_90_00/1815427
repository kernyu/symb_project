We report the case of a 54-year-old, quadriplegic woman with a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) vaginal infection. After failing a five-day course of intravenous vancomycin therapy, the patient was treated for ten days with mupirocin ointment applied intravaginally twice daily, which resulted in eradication of the infection. This report details a novel approach in treating MRSA vaginal infections.
