Nalidixic acid-resistant derivatives of Neisseria gonorrhoeae WR302 were identified and categorized into two classes on the basis of their susceptibilities to this antimicrobial agent. The MIC of nalidixic acid for the derivative strain MUG116 was fourfold greater than that for its isogenic parental strain WR302 (2 versus 0.5 micrograms/ml, respectively). MUG324 was significantly more resistant to nalidixic acid (greater than 64 micrograms/ml). The MICs of other antimicrobial agents known to interact with either the gyrA or gyrB gene products were determined. Although the nalidixic acid MIC for MUG116 increased, no significant increases in the MICs of other agents that interact with the gyrA gene product were seen. The MICs of all agents that interact with the gyrA gene product were significantly increased for MUG324. The gene that imparts low-level nalidixic acid resistance was cloned from strain MUG116. The DNA sequence of this gene was determined, and by comparing the deduced amino acid sequence with sequences of proteins in data bases, this protein was found to be approximately 70% homologous with the gyrB gene product of Escherichia coli.
