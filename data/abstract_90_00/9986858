Three hundred sixty-two Streptococcus pneumoniae strains were isolated from children under 5 years of age at Dhaka Shishu (Children) Hospital from 1993 to 1997. The strains were isolated from blood (n = 105), CSF (n = 164), ear swab (n = 61), eye swab (n = 20), and pus (n = 12). Of the 362 isolates, 42 (11.6%) showed intermediate resistance (MIC, <0.1 microgram/ml) and only 4 (1.1%) showed complete resistance (MIC, >2.0 microgram/ml) to penicillin. Penicillin resistance exhibited a strong relationship with serotype 14; 47.8% of the penicillin-resistant strains belonged to this type. A remarkably high (64.1%) resistance to co-trimoxazole was observed, along with a significant increase during the time period studied; there was no relationship to capsular type. By way of contrast, penicillin resistance did not show any significant change during the study period. Resistance to chloramphenicol (2.2%) and erythromycin (1.1%) was rare. The high resistance to co-trimoxazole and its increasing trend demand elucidation of the clinical impact of pneumonia treatment by this antimicrobial and reconsideration of the World Health Organization recommendation for co-trimoxazole administration to children with community-acquired pneumonia at the health care worker level in Bangladesh.
