Pseudomonas aeruginosa is important in the field of infectious disease especially with respect to its role in nosocomial infections. Infections with P. aeruginosa may be a problem as the organism has intrinsic resistance to several antibiotics and a capability in acquiring resistance during antibiotic therapy. Fluoroquinolones are sometimes used during antibiotic therapy of P. aeruginosa infections even though resistance to fluoroquinolones may develop. Six strains of P. aeruginosa were studied in an attempt to elucidate the mechanisms of resistance to fluoroquinolones. These included the electrophoresis patterns of the outer membrane proteins (OMPs), random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses. A method is described that improved the clarity of the OMP gels. Resistance in these P. aeruginosa strains could depend not only on DNA-gyrase modifications but also on membranes alterations and on the presence (qualitative and quantitative) of the efflux pump formed by three subunits.
