Two neonates with early onset respiratory illness were found to have Haemophilus influenzae septicaemia. One of them died. A review of the English literature showed that Haemophilus influenzae septicaemia is increasing in incidence. Almost all cases presented with respiratory distress in the first 2 days. Other associated features included meningitis, arthritis, conjunctivitis and cellulitis. The mortality, which averaged 52%, was high, especially in premature babies. The septicaemia was caused by ascending infection from the colonized maternal birth canal, and most cases were caused by nontypable strains of Haemophilus influenzae. Because of the occurrence of ampicillin or chloramphenicol resistance, a third generation cephalosporin is the treatment of choice for known cases of serious infection.
