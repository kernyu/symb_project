Efficacies of ceftibuten (CETB, 7432-S, 200 mg/capsule) in urinary tract infections (UTI) were studied. The results of the study are summarized as described below. 1. CETB was administered to 15 complicated chronic cases of UTI using a dose level of 400 mg per day. The efficacy rates determined according to the criteria prescribed by the UTI committee and according to physicians' judgements were 81.8% and 92.3%, respectively. Bacteriological efficacy rates were 100% against Gram-negative rods and 87.5% against Gram-positive cocci. 2. Only 1 case of adverse reaction, slight dizziness, was noted. 3. CETB appears to be the most useful agent of the new oral cephems against strains of Serratia marcescens which are resistant to new quinolones.
