Thirty-six cases of pseudomonas aeruginosa septicemia were found in 5 years from 1986 to 1990. The main risk factors predisposing septicemia included severe underlying diseases and local primary infection or impaired anatomic barrier. The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapy, and leukopenia were also important risk factors. The percentages of in vitro resistant strains to 8 antipseudomonal antibiotics varied from 18% to 47%. The overall effective rate was 42% in 26 patients receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy. The mortality attributable to pseudomonas aeruginosa septicemia was 61%. The prevention and antibiotic treatment of pseudomonas aeruginosa septicemia are discussed.
