The sensitivity of selected bacteria to a range of antibiotics was tested under hyperbaric conditions used in saturation diving. The effect of hyperbaric helium and oxygen (heliox) on antibiotic stability and on induction of beta-lactamase was also determined. Increased resistance to penicillin (up to 23%) was shown by Staphylococcus aureus and to gentamicin (up to 46%) and rifampicin (up to 18%) by Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium at 36 and 71 bar pressure. Exposure to 71 bar heliox did not affect antibiotic activity but increased the production of beta-lactamase in inducible S. aureus and Bacillus subtilis and production of beta-galactosidase in inducible E. coli. Increased resistance to antibiotics in saturation diving conditions can be attributed in some cases to the influence of hyperbaric pressure on induction mechanisms in bacteria. The experimental system devised for this work is suitable for more detailed examination of the influence of hyperbaric stress on antibiotic resistance and of its effect on induction mechanisms in general.
