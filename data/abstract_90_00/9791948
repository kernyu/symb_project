From concrete debris of a demolished herbicide production plant several Gram-negative bacterial strains were isolated, which exhibit metabolic capabilities for the degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol (DCP)l), 4-chloro-2-methylphenol (MCP) and 4-chlorophenol (4-CP), while 2-chlorophenol (2-CP) was degraded at a slower rate. Degradative activity was inducible and was impeded by adding of 100 mg/l of chloramphenicol to growing cultures. The strains displayed alkaliphilic properties with optimum DCP/MCP degradation at pH values around 8.5-9.5; activity was observed up to pH values of 11. Degradation was most likely complete according to chlorine balances; formation of intermediary products was observed with MCP some time. Specific activity of up to 380 mumol/h.g dry mass was found within the concentration range of 10-20 mg/l DCP; higher concentrations retarded the activity with complete inhibition at 200-400 mg/l. Some of the strains carry plasmids whose presence was not unambiguously correlated to the degradative properties. Ribotyping revealed a high degree of relationship between the strains. Preliminary taxonomic investigations showed close relationship to Ochrobactrum anthropi.
