The in vivo effect of human macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) on the number of cells that formed stromal colonies in an in vitro culture system (stroma-initiating cells; SICs) was investigated. We found that the number of SICs in the femurs of C57BL/6 mice was significantly increased by the treatment with M-CSF. We also found that the SICs were resistant to at least three different chemotherapeutic reagents, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), cytarabine, and cyclophosphamide, because the femoral cells of mice treated with these reagents contained higher numbers of SICs than those of untreated mice. M-CSF treatment also increased the number of SICs of the reagent-pretreated mice. The SICs detected in our culture system were present only in Mac-1(-)CD45(-) cells, and the M-CSF treatment of 5-FU-pretreated mice actually increased the number of Mac-1(-)CD45(-) SICs. The Mac-1(-)CD45(-) SICs collected from mice that were pretreated with 5-FU and then treated with M-CSF formed stromal colonies under in vitro culture conditions that did not contain M-CSF but did contain a high concentration of fetal calf serum. This result suggested that SICs collected following the treatment procedure did not necessarily require the presence of M-CSF for their in vitro proliferation. Our study indicated that M-CSF has the ability to increase the number of progenitor or precursor cells for bone marrow stromal cells in vivo system.
