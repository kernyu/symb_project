We report a case of successful mitral valve replacement performed on the patient who is an infective endocarditis due to MRSA. She was 27-year-old female and treated by antibiotics medication because of remittent fever two years ago. On August 1995, cerebral infarction occurred and she was pointed out endocarditis. After high fever continued, blood cultures demonstrated MRSA. Furthermore, echocardiography showed vegetation on posterior mitral valve leaflet and moderate mitral regurgitation so, mitral valve replacement with a S.J.M. 25 mm performed to control MRSA sepsis condition. During operation, we used VCM 2 g into the extracorporeal circulation and after operation 0.5 g intravenously every 6 hours. Two weeks later we changed antibiotics to FOM, Viccillin and ABK according to the result of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) obtained through blood culture. The patient was discharged on the 44 th postoperative day because of her uneventful postoperative course.
