A comparison of Campylobacter jejuni VPI strain H840 (ATCC 29428), which can grow at O2 levels up to 15%, with variant strain MC711-01 (which can grow at O2 levels up to 21-26%) indicated that the specific activity of catalase in crude cell extracts was higher in the variant by a factor of 1.6 to 2.5, depending on cultural conditions. Smaller differences occurred with superoxide dismutase activity, while peroxidase activities were invariably lower in the variant strain. The variant strain was much more resistant than the wild type to the bactericidal effects of H2O2. The results suggest that catalase activity might be one of the factors associated with the greater tolerance of O2 by the variant strain. However, both strains became more susceptible to H2O2 when cultures were initially grown at 6% O2 and then shifted to 21% O2; thus the role of catalase in the oxygen tolerance of C. jejuni is probably minor.
