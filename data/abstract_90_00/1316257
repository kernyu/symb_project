The in vitro activities of enoxacin, lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and pefloxacin against 274 strains of Salmonella typhi isolated from suspected typhoid fever patients (137 multi-resistant strains and 137 strains sensitive to chloramphenicol, ampicillin and/or co-trimoxazole) were determined using disk diffusion and agar dilution techniques. In vitro, enoxacin was active against all tested strains with a MIC90 and inhibition zone size against multi-resistant strains of 0.12 mg/l and 34 mm diameter, respectively. Similar results were found with the other fluoroquinolones. Enoxacin and other fluoroquinolones may be the therapy of choice in cases of typhoid fever caused by organisms resistant to the standard therapy, chloramphenicol.
