Protegrins are 16 to 18 amino acid, cationic antimicrobial peptides that are produced by porcine neutrophils, and are activated extracellularly by cleavage of the pro-protegrin molecule by neutrophil elastase. Biologically, the protegrins are characterized by broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, rapid microbicidal action and low inherent ability to induce microbial resistance.Structurally, the protegrins form amphiphilic beta-sheets maintained by two intramolecular disulfides that are key for optimal biological activity. A synthetic protegrin analog, IB-367, is in clinical development as a locally administered agent in one program to prevent oral mucositis, a significant side effect of high dose chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and in another program to prevent nosocomial pneumonia in patients undergoing mechanically assisted ventilation.
