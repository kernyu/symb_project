OBJECTIVE: To study bacteria and drug sensitivity of catheter-related sepsis (CRS). METHODS: Between February 1993 and December 1997, 52 patients with central venous catheter-related sepsis were studied retrospectively. RESULTS: The most common organisms were staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermis. The bacterial pathogens isolated demonstrated a marked pattern of antibiotic resistance. Gram-positive cocci were sensitive to vancomycin with a sensitivity of 93.3%, and gram-negative bacilli were sensitive to amikacin and ceftazidine with a sensitivity of 51.7%. CONCLUSIONS: The effective treatment of catheter-related sepsis is removal of infected catheters. Vancomycin and (or) amikacin may be first chosen to treat CRS.
