The 5' untranslated region, also called the leader, of oncoretroviruses and lentiviruses is long and is formed of several structured domains critically important in virus replication. The 5' leader of murine leukemia virus (MLV) RNA contains an internal ribosomal entry segment (IRES) which promotes synthesis of Gag and glyco-Gag polyprotein precursors. In the present study we investigated the translational features of the 5' leader of MLV subgenomic RNA (env RNA) encoding the Env polyprotein precursor. When the env leader was inserted between two genes, such as lacZ and the neomycin resistance cassette, in a dicistronic vector, it allowed IRES-dependent translation of the 3' cistron in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system and in murine cells. The drug rapamycin and the foot-and-mouth disease virus L protease, known to inhibit cap-dependent translation, caused an enhancement of the translation driven by the env leader sequence, consistent with an IRES activity promoting Env expression. Analysis of several deletion mutants led us to localize the minimal env IRES between the splice junction and the env AUG start codon.
