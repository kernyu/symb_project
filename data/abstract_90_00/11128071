The susceptibility of 224 Streptococcus pyogenes isolates obtained from children in Japan from 1981 to 1997 to treatment with erythromycin was determined by the agar dilution method. A total of 17 isolates belonging to serotype M12T12 were resistant (MICs>1 microg/ml). Fourteen of the 17 resistant strains obtained from 1982 to 1985 harbored ermB and showed an identical pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern, indicating the spread of a single clone. Two ermTR-containing isolates were obtained in 1983. mefA gene was found in a strain obtained in 1994 in the present study, although this gene is predominantly associated with recent erythromycin resistance among S. pyogenes strains in many countries.
