We have studied the phenotypic impact of adaptative Gag cleavage site mutations in patient-derived human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) variants having developed resistance to the protease inhibitor ritonavir or saquinavir. We found that Gag mutations occurred in a minority of resistant viruses, regardless of the duration of the treatment and of the protease mutation profile. Gag mutations exerted only a partial corrective effect on resistance-associated loss of viral fitness. Reconstructed viruses with resistant proteases displayed multiple Gag cleavage defects, and in spite of Gag adaptation, several of these defects remained, explaining the limited corrective effect of cleavage site mutations on fitness. Our data provide clear evidence of the interplay between resistance and fitness in HIV-1 evolution in patients treated with protease inhibitors.
