BACKGROUND: Furazolidone is an inexpensive antibiotic that has considerable anti-Helicobacter pylori activity in vitro. METHODS: Twenty-three patients with culture-proven H. pylori infection were treated for one week with a dual therapy containing omeprazole and furazolidone. RESULTS: Eradication succeeded in 10 of the first 20 evaluable patients (50%; 95% CI: 27.2-72.8%). This percentage was regarded as too low, and the study was terminated. Side-effects were mild. CONCLUSION: With the possible increase in resistance to metronidazole and clarithromycin world-wide, furazolidone may be useful alternative in the treatment of H. pylori infection. Dual therapy for one week, however, is not sufficient.
