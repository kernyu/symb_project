Salmonella typhimurium definitive type 104 (DT104) is a virulent pathogen for humans and animals with many strains having multiple drug resistance characteristics. The organism typically carries resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, florfenicol, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and tetracycline (ACSSuT-resistant). A multiplex PCR method was developed to simultaneously amplify four genes, florfenicol (flo(st)), virulence (spvC), invasion (invA), and integron (int) from S. typhimurium DT104 (ACSSuT-type). Twenty-two ACSSuT-resistant DT104 isolates in our collection gave 100% positive reactions to this PCR assay by amplifying 584-, 392-, 321- and 265-bp PCR products, using primers specific to the respective target genes. One Salmonella strain DT23, ACSSuT-resistant, phage type 711 failed to amplify the 584-bp fragment, indicating that this method is specific for DT104-type ACSSuT-resistant S. typhimurium strains. One clinical and one bovine ASSuT-resistant strains that were sensitive to chloramphenicol and florfenicol did not yield a 584-bp fragment, indicating the absence of the flo(st) gene. This method will be useful for rapid identification of ACSSuT-type DT104 strains from clinical, food and environmental samples.
