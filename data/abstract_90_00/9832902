Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most commonly diagnosed problems by primary care providers. Diagnosis of AOM is based upon positive physical findings of a full or bulging tympanic membrane (TM), absent or obscured bony landmarks, distorted or absent light reflex, and decreased or absent mobility of the TM. Prevention through education and early detection of AOM are the best methods for avoiding serious complications and sequelae. The antibiotics available for treatment of AOM are extensive. Treatment of AOM should be based upon clinical diagnosis and current research-based options for treatment.
