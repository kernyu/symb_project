Methods have been described to assist in the detection of anthelmintic resistance in strongylid nematodes of ruminants, horses and pigs. Two tests are recommended, an in vivo test, the faecal egg count reduction test for use in infected animals, and an in vitro test, the egg hatch test for detection of benzimidazole resistance in nematodes that hatch shortly after embryonation. Anaerobic storage for submission of faecal samples from the field for use in the in vitro test is of value and the procedure is described. The tests should enable comparable data to be obtained in surveys in all parts of the world.
