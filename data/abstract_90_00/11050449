The current epidemic of bacterial resistance is attributed, in part, to the overuse of antibiotics. Recent studies have documented increases in resistance with over-use of particular antibiotics and improvements in susceptibility when antibiotic use is controlled. The most effective means of improving use of antibiotics is unknown. Comprehensive management programs directed by multi-disciplinary teams, computer-assisted decision-making, and antibiotic cycling have been beneficial in controlling antibiotic use, decreasing costs without impacting patient outcomes, and possibly decreasing resistance.
