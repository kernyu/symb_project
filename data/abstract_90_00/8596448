A multidrug resistance gene (mdr) has been cloned from Streptomyces pristinaespiralis, a producer of two antibiotics having synergistic activities together known as pristinamycin. This gene, ptr, provides resistance not only to two structurally dissimilar compounds (pristinamycin I, PI; pristinamycin II, PII) and the natural pristinamycin mixture but also to rifampicin. Mutagenesis and subcloning of ptr localized it to a 2 kb region which was sequenced and analyzed. It contained an open reading frame of 1506 bp which encoded a putative membrane protein with 14 hydrophobic domains, and showed sequence similarity to a superfamily of bacterial proteins that employ transmembrane electrochemical gradients to catalyse active efflux of various antibiotics and toxic compounds. Ptr was most similar to a subfamily which included other mdr genes and antibiotic transport genes associated with antibiotic biosynthetic gene clusters in actinomycetes. In vitro coupled transcription-translation experiments were used to identify the ptr gene product. Analysis of the upstream region did not reveal a divergently transcribed repressor gene, as is the case for several related resistance determinants involved in antibiotic transport, suggesting that ptr is regulated by a different mechanism. Transcriptional analyses of this gene, carried out in both S. pristinaespiralis and Streptomyces lividans, indicated the same transcriptional start point and predicted -10 and -35 hexamers which were somewhat similar to Streptomyces vegetative-type promoters.
