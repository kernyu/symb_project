Previous trials had indicated that various schedules of sub-antimicrobial doxycycline significantly reduced gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) collagenase activity in adult patients with periodontitis with no evidence of emergent tetracycline-resistant (Tcr) marker oral flora. The purpose of this nine-month study was to expand these observations, emphasizing newer microbial diagnostic methods. Subgingival paper point samples were obtained at baseline (BL), 3, 6, and 9 months. Four subject treatment groups in a double-blind design were evaluated by mechanical scaling and root planing (SRP) and/or 20 mg doxycycline BID (Periostat). Thirty-eight patients entered the study at baseline (BL). Dark-field microscopy on 260 samples showed that morphotype distribution was independent of treatment schedule. Culture analysis of the 3 most prevalent isolates recovered showed that Streptococcus and Prevotella species accounted for approximately 85% of the 724 cultures. There did not appear to be any overgrowth or replacement by opportunistic oral flora. Of 658 susceptibility patterns evaluated by Etest, the MIC50/90 and mode MIC showed stable patterns, independent of treatment group. Our findings were different from those of previously published reports, but may be partly explained by the lack of universally standardized methods in oral microbiology and interpretive criteria for susceptibility testing.
