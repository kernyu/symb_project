Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 20 antimicrobial agents were determined for 67 field strains of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae isolated from the lungs of piglets with pleuropneumonia during the period 1992 to 1994, in Japan. Of these 67 strains, all 29 strains that were identified as serotypes 1 and 7 were resistant to chloramphenicol and tiamphenicol, whereas all of those identified as serotypes 2, 5 and 8 were susceptible to these antibiotics. Furthermore, 20 of 23 streptomycin-resistant strains were serotype 1, while, only 3 strains were serotype 2. These results suggest that the different serotypes of A. pleuropneumoniae vary in terms of antimicrobial-resistance.
