The sequence of the Tn1696 determinant for inducible nonenzymatic chloramphenicol resistance has been determined. The cml region, the fourth insert of the Tn1696 integron, is 1547 bases and includes a 59-base element at the 3' end, as is typical of integron inserts. One gene, designated cmlA and predicting a polypeptide of 44.2 kDa, is encoded in the insert. However, the cmlA region shows one feature not previously found in an integron insert. A promoter is located within the cmlA insert, and translational attenuation signals related to those of the inducible cat and ermC genes found in gram-positive organisms are also present. The regulatory region includes a leader peptide of nine amino acids, a ribosome stall sequence related to those preceding cat genes, and two alternative pairs of stem-loop structures which either sequester or disclose the ribosome binding site and start codon preceding the cmlA gene.
