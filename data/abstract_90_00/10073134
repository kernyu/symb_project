A series of 2-mercapto-N-(1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)benzenesulfonamide derivatives containing the triazole moiety fused with a variety of heteroaromatic rings [XVI-XXVIII] was obtained by the reactions of 3-methylthio-1,4-2-benzodithiazine 1,1-dioxide derivatives [Ia-d] with 2-hydrazines [IIa-f]. Some of the intermediate 1,1-dioxide-1,4,2-benzodithiazin-3-ylhydrazines [III-XV] initially formed were also isolated. Preliminary screening data indicated that compounds [XVI-XIX and XXVII] were anti-HIV inactive, whereas other compounds showed a high [XXI and XXIII], fairly high [XXIII and XXVI] or moderate [XX, XXIV, XXV and XXVIII] activity. The compound [XXI] exhibited also high activity against ten selected HIV mutants.
