Twenty-five out of 55 patients of enteric fever were documented as multidrug resistant enteric fever cases. In the resistant cases the drug sensitivity of salmonella species in vitro were mainly augmentin, ceftriaxone, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin. Sixteen patients were treated with ciprofloxacin and 9 were treated with norfloxacin for 14 days. Fever touched normal in 62.5% cases with ciprofloxacin and in 33.3% cases with norfloxacin by the 7th day. It became normal in 88% with ciprofloxacin and in 66% with norfloxacin by the 10th day and it became normal in 100% cases in each group by the 14th day. The newer 4-quinolones can be recommended in multidrug resistant enteric fever in adults.
