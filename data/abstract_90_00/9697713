Selecting antiretroviral therapies for human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected persons is complicated by the availability of a vast number of potentially useful drug combinations and by extensive variation among patients in their resistance to various drugs. AIDS clinical trials have used designs in which a handful of drug regimens in a few patient classes can be compared. Here is proposed implementation of innovative designs with factorial structure that permit assessment of many treatment arms and patient classes in a single trial; when and how they can be appropriately used are discussed. These designs are efficient, permit systematic investigation of correlations between genetic mutations and in vivo drug resistance, and provide insight into important drug interactions in people that conventional designs are unable to provide. Through creative application of these designs, identification of superior drug combinations and the science of understanding in vivo joint drug dynamics and genotypic resistance will progress at an optimum pace.
