A total of 140 non-replicate Streptococcus pneumoniae community isolates from Greek children collected during the period 1995-1997 were studied. Combined intermediate and high penicillin resistance rates were 23% in 1995, 29% in 1996, and 27% in 1997. The proportion of highly resistant isolates steadily increased from 2% in 1995 to 12% in 1997. There was no significant difference in penicillin resistance rates among colonizing and infecting isolates (23 and 27%, respectively). Over the study period, a clear shift towards higher penicillin MIC was observed among both the susceptible and resistant groups. Thus, penicillin resistance rates were equally high among colonizing and infecting isolates and resistance levels appeared to be gradually increasing throughout the entire S. pneumoniae population.
