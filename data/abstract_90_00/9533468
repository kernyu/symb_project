A multicentre, open-label, randomized study was performed in 501 out-patients with acute otitis media, aged 6-36 months, to study the impact of treatment with either cefixime suspension 8 mg/kg/day bd or co-amoxiclav suspension 80 mg/kg/day tds for 10 days on nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Of 426 patients with nasopharyngeal cultures at entry to the trial, end of treatment and at follow-up visit (35 days after inclusion), significant changes in carriage of S. pneumoniae were observed. The proportion of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae was higher in the samples taken at the end of treatment and follow-up than in those taken at inclusion, while the total number of children with this microorganism was lower. The difference at the end of treatment was greater with co-amoxiclav than with cefixime. For H. influenzae the resistance rate remained steady while the number of children with this microorganism decreased. At follow-up there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of nasopharyngeal positive culture for S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae. Despite these differences, successful clinical responses were similar at the end of treatment and at follow-up.
