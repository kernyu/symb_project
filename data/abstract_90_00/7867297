Enterococci have become an important cause of nosocomial infections and may demonstrate high-level resistance to multiple antibiotics. We present the case of a 68-year-old man with a history of small cell lung cancer, who developed bacteremia due to a strain of Enterococcus faecium. The isolate was resistant to multiple antibiotics including vancomycin, ampicillin, aminoglycosides, quinolones, and macrolides. The patient was successfully treated with doxycycline and removal of an infected central venous catheter.
