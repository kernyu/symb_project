Protein A of Staphylococcus aureus contains a polymorphic Xr-region characterized by a tandem repeat of eight amino acid units. In this study, the diversity of genes encoding the repeat regions and their relatedness among S. aureus strains was analyzed. Ten different protein-A types characterized by repeat numbers 4-13 were identified in a total of 293 clinical isolates. The protein-A type with 10 repeat units (10 repeats) in the Xr-region was most frequently detected in methicillin-resistant S. aureus, whereas the majority of methicillin-susceptible strains were distributed almost evenly into protein-A types with 7-11 repeats. Strains that belonged to a single coagulase type were classified into multiple protein-A types, e.g. strains with the common coagulase types II and VII were differentiated into 7 and 8 protein-A types, respectively. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the Xr-region of 42 representative strains revealed the presence of 37 different genotypes (spa types), which were constituted by a combination of several of 24 different repeat unit genotypes. Based on the similarity in arrangement of repeat unit genotypes, 34 strains with different repeat numbers were classified into 5 genetic clusters (C1-C5). The clusters C1, C2 and C3 consisted exclusively of strains with identical coagulase types II, III, and IV, respectively. These findings suggested that the protein-A gene of S. aureus has evolved from a common ancestral clone in individual clusters independently.
