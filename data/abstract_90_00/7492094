The bactericidal activity and emergence of resistance to RP 59500 (quinupristin/dalfopristin) when it was administered alone and in combination with vancomycin against fibrin clots that have been infected with methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 or methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) 67 were evaluated in an in vitro pharmacodynamic infected fibrin clot model. Fibrin clots were infected with S. aureus to achieve an inoculum of approximately 10(9) CFU/g. Antibiotics were administered to simulate pharmacokinetics in humans: RP 59500 (7.5 mg/kg of body weight) every 8 h and vancomycin (15 mg/kg) every 12 h over 72 h. Preliminary test tube time-kill experiments with an inoculum of approximately 10(5) CFU/ml suggested that RP 59500 was more rapid in achieving a 99.9% reduction in the number of CFU per milliliter than vancomycin against ATCC 25923 (6.94 versus 24 h; P = 0.0003) and MRSA 67 (6.77 versus 17.03 h; P = 0.004). At a higher inoculum (approximately 10(8) CFU/ml), 99.9% kill was achieved only with the combination regimen against ATCC 25923 and MRSA 67 (10.9 and 10.5 h, respectively), with total reductions of 6.35 and 6.33 log10 CFU/ml over 24 h, respectively. In the fibrin clot model, RP 59500 was more effective than vancomycin in reducing organism titers over 72 h. In the fibrin clot model, the most optimal therapy was the combination regimen.
