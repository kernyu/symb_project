A total of 124 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were tested for synergy between levofloxacin and cefpirome, ceftazidime, gentamicin, and meropenem. Checkerboards yielded synergistic fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices (< or =0.5) with 25 of 496 possible combinations. All other FIC indices were >0.5 to 2 (additive or indifferent), with no antagonism. Time-kill studies with 12 strains showed that levofloxacin (0.06 to 0.5 microg/ml) was synergistic with cefpirome, ceftazidime, gentamicin, and meropenem in 10, 9, 4, and 11 strains, respectively.
