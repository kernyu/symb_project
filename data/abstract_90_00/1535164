Cyclosporin A (CsA) alters the production of prostaglandins (PG) by the kidney. CsA causes an increase in renal vascular resistance, a decrease in renal blood flow, a decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and increases the renal production of the vasoconstrictor thromboxane. Recently, low dose CsA has been utilized in the treatment of refractory autoimmune diseases. To determine if low dose CsA administration could produce renal hemodynamic alterations and to determine if the thromboxane receptor antagonist L655,240 could prevent these alterations, we administered groups of rats either CsA, 5 mg/kg, subcutaneously and the L655,240 vehicle NaHCO3 (CsA-NaHCO3), or CsA and L655,240 (CsA-L655,240), or CsA vehicle and L655,240. The rats were administered the drugs for 7 days and then subjected to inulin and PAH clearances or kidneys were harvested for prostaglandin production studies. CsA significantly depressed GFR and renal plasma flow when compared to the L655,240 treated groups. There was no difference in inulin or PAH clearance between the CsA-L655,240 and CsA vehicle L655,240 groups. Glomerular prostaglandin production including thromboxane was depressed by CsA administration. No histologic alterations were noted in the glomeruli or the medullary portions of the kidney. We conclude that administration of low dose CsA, 5 mg/kg, for 7 days results in a decrease in renal blood flow and GFR without histologic alterations. Administration of the thromboxane receptor antagonist L655,240 prevents the renal hemodynamic alterations induced by CsA in this rat model.
