Field malaria studies require often the on site detection of chloroquine in urine for monitoring chemoprophylaxis and treatment compliance, investigating drug-use patterns and screening prospective subjects for in vitro and in vivo chemosensitivity tests. The field adapted methods are described, analytical characteristics are compared and different approaches to field adapted assay of chloroquine are discussed.
