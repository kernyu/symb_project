BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that the 72-kDa heat shock protein (HSP72) can be induced in renal tubular cells by a variety of stress conditions, and suggested its cytoprotective function. We have tested this hypothesis directly by transfection studies. METHODS: LLC-PK1 cells (porcine renal tubular epithelial cells) were stably transfected with pBK-CMV or pBK-CMV containing the human HSP72 gene (pBK-CMV-HSP72). These cells were then treated with various concentrations of hydrogen peroxide or cisplatin. The cell viability and lytic cell damage were determined by the MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay and lactate dehydrogenase release assay. RESULTS: Immunoblot and immunocytochemical analyses showed the high level expression of HSP72 in LLC-PK1 cells transfected with pBK-CMV-HSP72. In addition, the expression of other major HSPs (HSP90, HSP73, HSP60 and HSP27) was not affected by transfection. LLC-PK1 cells overexpressing HSP72 were significantly more resistant to hydrogen peroxide and cisplatin treatments than control cells. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that overexpressed HSP72 plays a direct role in protecting renal tubular cells against oxidative injury and cisplatin toxicity.
