Cyanide-resistant ("alternative") respiration was studied in Arabidopsis during incompatible and compatible infection with Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000. Total leaf respiration increased as the leaves became necrotic, as did the cyanide-resistant component that was sensitive to salicylhydroxamic acid. Infiltration of leaves with an avirulent strain rapidly induced alternative oxidase (AOX) mRNA, whereas the increase was delayed in the compatible combination. The increase in mRNA correlated with the increase in AOX protein. Increased expression was confined to the infected leaves, in contrast to the pathogenesis-related protein-1, which was induced systemically. Virtually all of the AOX protein was in the reduced (high-activity) form. Using transgenic NahG and mutant npr1-1 and etr1-1 plants, we established that the rapid induction of the AOX was associated with necrosis and that ethylene, but not salicylic acid, was required for its induction. Increased pyruvate levels in the infected leaves suggested that increased substrate levels were respired through the alternative pathway; however, in the control leaves and the infected leaves, respiration was not inhibited by salicylhydroxamic acid alone. Increased respiration appeared to be associated primarily with symptom expression rather than resistance reactions.
