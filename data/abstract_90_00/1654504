A-factor (2-isocapryloyl-3R-hydroxymethyl-gamma-butyrolactone) is a microbial hormone controlling streptomycin (Sm) production, Sm resistance and sporulation in Streptomyces griseus. In order to identify A-factor-dependent promoters in the Sm biosynthetic gene cluster, a new promoter-probe plasmid with a low copy number was constructed by using an extremely thermostable malate dehydrogenase gene as the reporter. Of the three promoters in the Sm production region that includes strR, aphD and strB, only the promoter of strR, which codes for a putative regulatory protein, was found to be directly controlled by A-factor. This was also confirmed by S1 nuclease mapping. The region essential for its A-factor-dependence was determined to be located 430-330 base pairs upstream of the transcriptional start point. Increase in the copy number of the strR promoter region did not lead to a corresponding increase in the total promoter activity, probably due to titration of a putative activator which binds to the enhancer-like region and controls the expression of the strR promoter. This putative activator is apparently distinct from the A-factor-receptor protein. The aphD gene, which encodes the major Sm resistance determinant, Sm-6-phosphotransferase, was transcribed mainly by read-through from the A-factor-dependent strR promoter; this accounts for the prompt induction of Sm resistance by A-factor.
