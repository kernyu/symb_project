Nitric oxide (NO) acts as a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator in the nervous systems of many vertebrates and invertebrates. We investigated the mechanism of NO action at an identified synapse between a mechanoafferent neuron, C2, and the serotonergic metacerebral cell (MCC) in the cerebral ganglion of the mollusc Aplysia californica. Stimulation of C2 produces a decreasing conductance, very slow EPSP in the MCC. C2 is thought to use histamine and NO as cotransmitters at this synapse, because both agents mimic the membrane responses. Now we provide evidence that treatment with NO donors stimulates soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) in the MCC, and as a result cGMP increases. S-Nitrosocysteine (SNC, an NO donor) and 8-bromo-cGMP (8-Br-cGMP) both induced the membrane depolarization and increase in input resistance that are characteristic of the very slow EPSP. Two inhibitors of sGC, 6-anilino-5,8-quinolinequinone (LY83583) and 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4, 3-a]quinoxaline-1-one (ODQ), suppressed both the very slow EPSP and the membrane responses to SNC but not the histamine membrane responses. NO-induced cGMP production was determined in the MCC using cGMP immunocytochemistry (cGMP-IR). In the presence of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), 10 microM SNC was sufficient to induce cGMP-IR, and the staining intensity increased as the SNC dose was increased. This cGMP-IR was suppressed by ODQ in a dose-dependent manner and completely blocked by 10 microM ODQ. Histamine did not induce cGMP-IR. The results suggest that NO stimulates sGC-dependent cGMP synthesis in the MCC and that cGMP mediates the membrane responses. The cotransmitter histamine induces essentially the same membrane responses but seems to use a separate and distinct second messenger pathway.
