28 cases of Haemophilus influenzae meningitis were retrospectively treated in a children's hospital between October 1980 and March 1987. The average age was between 23 +/- 36 months, ranged between 3 months and 13 years. Eight were females and 20 males (1/2.5). Antibiograms were obtained from 14 samples (50%), 36% was resistant to ampicillin, 7% to chloramphenicol and 7% to both. All patients, with two exceptions, were treated with third generation cephalosporins. During the hospitalization period, the following complications were found: convulsions (18%), tone and/or mobility alterations (18%), hydrocephalus or transventricular echographic dilations (14%), early deafness (3%). 54% did not develop any complications and only one patient died. Considering the high proportion of cases resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol or both, it is suggested to evaluate cephalosporins as an alternative for the standard therapy.
