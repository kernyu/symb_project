The possibility of plasmid-encoded quinolone resistance is explored in two model systems. In the first, increasing amounts of wild-type gyrA allele moderately increased minimum inhibitory concentrations to quinolone antibiotics. In the second model, a mutant gyrA allele encoded by a multicopy plasmid produced a quinolone resistance phenotype upon its expression in a quinolone-susceptible Escherichia coli strain.
