Over a period of 14 years (1973-1987), 3165 specimens submitted to the microbiology laboratory demonstrated the recovery of anaerobic bacteria. A total of 988 Bacteroides fragilis group isolates were recovered (0.3 isolates per specimen). Bacteroides fragilis accounted for 62% of the total of all B. fragilis group isolates, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron for 15%, Bacteroides vulgatus for 8%, Bacteroides ovatus for 7%, Bacteroides distasonis for 6%, and Bacteroides uniformis for 2%. Of the 988 B. fragilis group isolates, 310 (31%) were recovered after the administration of antimicrobial therapy, and 129 (13%) were the single isolate recovered from the infected site at that time. The recovery rate of all members of B. fragilis group after the administration of antimicrobial therapy, when isolated alone or when mixed with other bacteria, was similar. The data illustrate the equal ability of all members of the B. fragilis group to persist in and to contribute to the inflammatory process; and provide further support for their pathogenic role.
