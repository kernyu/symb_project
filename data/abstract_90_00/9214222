Thirty-eight patients (31 children and 7 adults) with meningococcal infection (sepsis and/or meningitis) were studied. The strain most frequently isolated was B (44.7%), followed by C (31.6%). Of the strains isolated, 52.6% were moderately resistant to penicillin (91.6% if only strain C was considered). No resistance to cephotaxime or chloramphenicol was found. Even though patients with moderately resistant strains treated with penicillin G evolved satisfactorily (minimum inhibitory concentrations 0.12-0.50 microgram/ml), the possible appearance of more resistant strains and/or of strains that produce beta-lactamase leads us to the conclusion that cephotaxime is the treatment of choice until an antibiogram is available.
