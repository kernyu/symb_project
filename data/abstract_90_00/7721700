Penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 7 of Escherichia coli is a poorly characterized member of the family of enzymes that synthesize and modify the bacterial cell wall. The approximate chromosomal position of the gene encoding this protein was determined by measuring the expression of PBPs during lytic infection of E. coli by each of the 476 miniset members of the Kohara lambda phage genomic library. Phages lambda 363 and lambda 364, encompassing the region from 47.7 to 48 min of the chromosome, overproduced PBP 7. One open reading frame, yohB, was present on both these phages and directed the expression of PBPs 7 and 8. The predicted amino acid sequence of PBP 7 contains the consensus motifs associated with other PBPs and has a potential site near the carboxyl terminus where proteolysis by the OmpT protein could occur, creating an appropriately sized PBP 8. The PBP 7 gene (renamed pbpG) was interrupted by insertion of a kanamycin resistance gene cassette and was moved to the chromosome of E. coli. No obvious growth defects were observed, suggesting that PBP 7 is not essential for growth under normal laboratory conditions.
