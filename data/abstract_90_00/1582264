Rodent x human hybrids containing single human chromosomes are valuable tools in the study of human genetics. Using a retrovirus carrying the neomycin gene, we generated a neomycin-resistant (neor) pool of human diploid fibroblasts. Following fusion of microcells prepared from this pool to mouse A9 cells, we obtained four neor hybrids containing a single human chromosome 2, 3, 5, or 15.
