Trifluoperazine, a calmodulin antagonist, completely inhibited the growth of mycobacteria. The minimum inhibitory concentrations in shake cultures in a synthetic medium containing 0.2% Tween 80 were 5 and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively, for the human pathogenic strain Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv and M. tuberculosis resistant to isoniazid. When added to a growing culture of M. tuberculosis H37Rv on the 10th day (mid exponential phase), trifluoperazine 50 micrograms/ml further arrested growth of this organism. It is suggested that trifluoperazine or similar calmodulin antagonists might be useful as antitubercular drugs.
