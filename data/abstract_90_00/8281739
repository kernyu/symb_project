In this case report from Italy we describe a fatal infection caused by A. hydrophila in a 39 yr old cirrhotic patient. This pathogen was isolated as a pure single culture from the patient's blood sample. The patient died on the second day of hospitalization from overwhelming sepsis. The A. hydrophila isolate was tested for different potential virulence properties, such as invasiveness, adherence, exotoxins production, presence of fimbriae and for the patterns of resistance to a variety of antimicrobial agents. Although, the Aeromonas species are infrequently reported as a cause of human infections, the present case study confirms the capability of these pathogens to induce serious human infections.
