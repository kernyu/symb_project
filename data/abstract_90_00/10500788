To determine the clinical significance of the lung resistance protein (LRP) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we have studied LRP expression of leukemic blasts and its association with clinical outcome in patients with de novo AML. LRP expression of leukemic blasts was determined by immunocytochemistry by means of monoclonal antibody LRP-56. LRP expression at diagnosis was detected in 31 out of 86 (36%) patients and correlated with white blood cell count (p = 0.01). The complete remission rate of induction chemotherapy was 72% for all treated patients (n = 82). The complete remission rate was 81% for patients without LRP expression but only 55% for patients with LRP expression (p = 0.01). Overall survival and disease-free survival were estimated according to Kaplan-Meier in 82 and 59 patients, respectively. At a median follow-up of 16 months, median overall survival was 17 months for LRP-negative patients but only 8 months for LRP-positive patients (p = 0.006). Disease-free survival was 9 months for LRP-negative patients and 6 months for LRP-positive patients (p = 0.078). Thus LRP predicts for poor outcome indicating that the LRP gene is a clinically relevant drug resistance gene in AML.
