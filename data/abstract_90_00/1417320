Optimal conditions were developed for determination of antibiotic sensitivity in Brucella by using enzyme immunoassay directly in the primary cultures of the material tested. The Brucella concentration in the material tested should be not lower than 1.10(6) microbial cells/ml and the time of culture incubation be 24 hours at 37 degrees C. The obligatory condition is to use a liquid medium, i.e. the Albimi broth with 1% glucose. To inhibit the foreign microflora it is recommended to use polymyxin B and amphoglucamine in a concentration of 3 microgram/ml. The use of enzyme immunoassay was shown that it was possible to determine the antibiotic sensitivity of Brucella in practice.
