The choice of empirical treatment for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is highly controversial. Our survey of 42 Australian emergency department doctors showed that monotherapy with a third-generation cephalosporin was the preferred regimen for severe CAP (14/42; 33%). We argue that cheaper regimens with a narrower spectrum are likely to be just as effective as third-generation cephalosporins and will have fewer adverse effects on the microbial ecology of hospitals. We suggest penicillin or ampicillin (to cover pneumococci--even if penicillin "resistant"--and Haemophilus influenzae), plus a macrolide (e.g., azithromycin or erythromycin; to cover Legionella and other "atypical" pathogens), plus a single large dose of an aminoglycoside (e.g., gentamicin; to cover gram-negative bacilli such as Klebsiella pneumoniae) as empirical therapy for severe CAP.
