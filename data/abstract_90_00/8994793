Antimicrobial agents in veterinary medicine are used for three purposes: therapy, prophylaxis, and nutrition. The major public health risk is that selection pressure leads to an increase in the pool of resistance genes. Since 1987, the nutritional use of antimicrobials in Europe has been regulated by a council directive, which demands special investigations into the potential of antimicrobials to increase rates of drug resistance. However, the prophylactic and therapeutic use of antimicrobials has sometimes led to the emergence of resistant bacteria. For example, the selective effect of the prophylactic use of gentamicin and the therapeutic use of quinolones led to the emergence of resistant salmonellae. To prevent the spread of resistant microorganisms from animals to humans, it should be recognized that antibiotics are not suitable as a compensation for poor hygiene standards or for the eradication of a pathogen from a certain environment. They should be used only by doctors or veterinarians.
