The macrolide FK-506, produced by Streptomyces tsukubaensis, is effective in sensitizing a multidrug resistant strain of Chinese hamster ovary cells to the cytotoxic action of vinblastine. FK-506 also promotes Adriamycin accumulation into both wild type and resistant cell lines. FK-506 may be a useful drug to enhance the effectiveness of anti-tumour cytotoxic drugs.
