Pulsed field gel electrophoresis showed that the initiation time of DNA breakage induced by the DNA alkylating agent duocarmycin A, which is not a redox-cycling agent, was almost the same in the human leukemia cell line HL-60 and its H2O2-resistant clone HP100. Catalase activity of HP100 cells was much higher than that of HL-60 cells. Duocarmycin A-mediated DNA ladder formation in HP100 cells was delayed compared with that in HL-60 cells, suggesting the involvement of H2O2 in duocarmycin A-induced apoptosis. Flow cytometry demonstrated that peroxide formation preceded loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (delta psi m) in cells treated with duocarmycin A. Then, caspase-3 was activated, followed by DNA ladder formation. These findings suggest that DNA damage by duocarmycin A induces H2O2 generation, which causes delta psi m loss and subsequently caspase-3 activation, resulting in apoptosis.
