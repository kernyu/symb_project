Cefpirome sulphate is a fourth-generation cephem antibiotic, which has a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, and is highly stable to beta-lactamase. Cefpirome sulphate was administered to 166 patients with obstetric or gynaecological infections, and its clinical and antibacterial effect was evaluable in 139. Excluding seven patients who violated the study protocol by receiving concomitant drugs, the safety of cefpirome sulphate was assessed in 159 patients. In the 139 patients in whom efficacy was evaluated, the improvement rate was 80.6% (112/139) and the eradication rate 72.6% (45/62). The eradication rate for bacteria isolated from the patients at the start of the study was 84.7% (111/131). No resistance to cefpirome sulphate was observed in Enterococcus faecalis or Bacteroides species. Systemic erythema and nausea each occurred in one patient, and nine patients showed abnormal hepatic function test results. These results suggest that cefpirome sulphate is effective in the treatment of obstetric and gynaecological infections and has a good side-effect profile.
