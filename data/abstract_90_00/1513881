The region of Bacteroides fragilis DNA on the recombinant plasmid pMT100 responsible for conferring metronidazole resistance in Escherichia coli strains was characterized. An open reading frame (ORF1) of 195 bp encoded a protein of 64 amino acids with a predicted M(r) of 7.3 kDa. Deletion analysis indicated that ORF1 conferred the metronidazole resistance phenotype and encoded a protein with an apparent M(r) of approximately 8-10 kDa.
