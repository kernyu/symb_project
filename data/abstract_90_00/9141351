A 50 year male developed a discoid lesion of leprosy on the face. Inspite of Dapsone 100 mg/day and Rifampicin 600 mgm per day the disease spread to both sides of the face and forehead. It became worse with Prednisolone and Clofazimine. It cleared completely when Sultamicillin was added to the latter. This seems to be the first patient of leprosy to be treated with this combination and reported.
