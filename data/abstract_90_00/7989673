Plasmodium falciparum sensitivity test in "in-vivo" carried out in 450 patients revealed, parasite clearance in 66.45 percent cases with 25 mgm/kg body wt of chloroquine. Mean parasite clearance time (MPCT) of sensitive and R I, resistant cases reached near parallelism with an early recrudescence in RI cases indicating stabilisation of genetic change in the parasite strain. The analysis of data revealed that proportionately higher resistance was recorded in coastal area having deciduous (wet) forest ecotype followed by plains of deciduous dry forest and semi arid/arid ecotypes.
