The effects of subcurative doses of chloroquine on rodent and human Plasmodium transmission to the mosquito have been studied by several authors who showed a short-term (12 h) enhancement of gametocyte infectivity by the drug, restricted to chloroquine-resistant strains, and a long term (4-6 days) enhancement of gametocytogenesis of chloroquine-sensitive strains of Plasmodium chabaudi. We investigated both short- and long-term effects of chloroquine on Plasmodium vinckei petteri, a chloroquine-sensitive rodent Plasmodium strain. Chloroquine treatment reduced the index of gametocytogenesis to 73% (5 mg/kg) and 55% (2.5 mg/kg) of controls, on day 6 post-infection (p.i.). The reduction was statistically significant with 5 mg/kg chloroquine. However, the reduction of gametocyte numbers did not affect the transmission capabilities of the strain. Our experiments showed that doses of 1 mg/kg chloroquine had no effect on the oocyst counts, 12 h post-administration to mice. A statistically non-significant 61% reduction of oocyst numbers was observed in mosquitoes fed on mice treated with 5 mg/kg chloroquine. The effect of 5 mg/kg chloroquine administration on the infectivity of gametocytes to mosquitoes fed 1 h post-treatment was also investigated. An overall 41% reduction of oocyst numbers was observed. This immediate effect was statistically significant in 73% of the mice. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the short-term enhancing effect of chloroquine on transmission is restricted to the drug-resistant strains of Plasmodium.
