Piperacillin (PIP) alone and combined with 4 mg/l, 8 mg/l of tazobactam (TAZ) were tested by MIC determination on Mueller-Hinton agar against 224 clinical strains of P. aeruginosa: "wild type" (BLA-), 32 producing a constitutive cephalosporinase (CEP), 41 producing the PSE-1 type beta-lactamase, 7 PSE-2, 8 PSE-3, 9 PSE-4, 13 TEM-1, 24 TEM-2, 13 OXA-1, 22 OXA-2, 5 OXA-3. The combination with 8 mg/l was more effective than that one with 4 mg/l. Combinations of PIP-TAZ 8 mg/l reduced the MICs of PIP for the resistant strains (MICs greater than 64 mg/l) to the susceptible ot the moderately susceptible range (MICs less than or equal to 64 mg/l) for 31% of the CEP producing strains, 63% of the PSE-1, 15% of the PSE-2, none of the PSE-3, 34% of the PSE-4, 39% of the TEM-1, 30% of the TEM-2, 23% of the OXA-1, 14% of the OXA-2, 27% of the OXA-3, TAZ is the first beta-lactamase inhibitor effective against the constitutive cephalosporinase of P. aeruginosa; it is also very effective against the most frequently found PSE-1 beta-lactamase in P. aeruginosa.
