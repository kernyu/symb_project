The results of amoxicillin-clavulanate (AUG) and ampicillin-sulbactam (A/S) susceptibility testing by three different susceptibility testing methods, the MicroScan, Etest, and Kirby-Bauer methods, for 61 consecutive isolates of ampicillin-resistant Escherichia coli from different patients were compared. There was poor correlation of results for the two agents, the most and least marked discrepancies being observed by the MicroScan method (86.9% susceptible to AUG and 4.9% susceptible to A/S) and the Kirby-Bauer method (39.4% susceptible to AUG and 32.8% susceptible to A/S), respectively. More organisms were susceptible to AUG than A/S, regardless of the susceptibility testing methodology. The results from a College of American Pathologists survey with one E. coli isolate tested at different institutions also indicated greater susceptibility to AUG than to A/S. These agents are thought to be equally efficacious clinically. The discrepancies observed among methods for each antimicrobial inhibitor combination and the discrepancies observed between the two agents by each testing method suggest that the breakpoints for these agents need to be reevaluated.
