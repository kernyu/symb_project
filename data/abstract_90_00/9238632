A positional scanning tetrapeptide library was chemically modified through alkylation and/or reduction of the amide bonds, thus generating three new combinatorial libraries with physico-chemical properties very different from the parent peptide library ('libraries from libraries'). Specific results were obtained with each of these libraries upon screening in kappa-opioid receptor binding and microdilution antimicrobial assays, illustrating the potential of the 'libraries from libraries' concept for the efficient generation of a variety of chemically diverse combinatorial libraries.
