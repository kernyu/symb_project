The types of topoisomerase alterations in genomically diverse epidemic and sporadic strains of methicillin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolated from European hospitals between 1984 and 1994 were characterized. Convergent dual mutations in gyrA (codon 83, 84, or 88) and grlA (codon 79 and/or 80) were found in all strains exhibiting high-level resistance to ciprofloxacin (MIC, 16 to > or = 128 microg/ml). In some epidemic strains, the resistant phenotype and genotype appeared in the 1990s and persisted thereafter.
