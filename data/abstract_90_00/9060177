A mating was made between two populations of Eimeria tenella possessing the complementary traits of normal development (virulence) + resistance to the anticoccidial drug arprinocid or precocious development (attenuation) + drug-sensitivity. A small number of "recombinant" oocysts was recovered. The inheritance of markers from both parents into 22 cloned lines derived from the recombinant oocysts was confirmed by analyses of restriction fragment length polymorphisms of four repetitive DNA sequences.
