Here we report that 2-deoxyglucose/Na azide treatment and free/conjugated doxorubicin are synergistic in cell killing. As demonstrated by fluorescence confocal microscopy, KB-V1 cells retained more conjugated doxorubicin than free doxorubicin. Verapamil or 2-deoxyglucose/Na azide enhanced only the retention of the free drug and the small (<70 kDa) conjugates, indicating that P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is not effective against large conjugates. Conjugated doxorubicin was excluded from nuclei. Initially both free and conjugated doxorubicin accumulated in cytoplasmic organelles. Upon 2-deoxyglucose/Na azide treatment, fluorescence labeling of organelles dissipated. Prolonged (24 h) incubation of conjugate-preloaded cells resulted in redistribution of some of the organelle-associated fluorescence to nuclei, suggesting decoupling. The appearance of free doxorubicin was confirmed by capillary electrophoresis. 2-Deoxyglucose/Na azide treatment also retarded decoupling. Our results suggest that energy starvation, in addition to increasing cellular retention of P-gp substrates, may affect cellular fate of conjugated drugs with a possible enhancing effect in cancer cell killing.
