Mycobacterium kansasii isolates from two patients showed relatively slow growth in BACTEC 12B medium (12B) (Becton Dickinson Diagnostic Instrument Systems, Sparks, Md.) compared with the more rapid growth of these isolates on solid media. This finding prompted an evaluation of the effect of PANTA (Becton Dickinson) on the growth rate of these isolates. Suspensions of one isolate from each of these two patients (A and B), six additional isolates from six other patients (C through H), and one M. kansasii American Type Culture Collection isolate were inoculated into 12B with PANTA, 12B with reconstituting fluid only, and Middlebrook 7H11 agar plates (Remel, Lenexa, Kans.). For the isolates from patients A and B, the average times to detection for 12B with PANTA, 12B with reconstituting fluid, and Middlebrook 7H11 agar were 12.3, 7.4, and 9.0 days, respectively. For the remaining six patient isolates and the American Type Culture Collection strain, the average times to detection for these media were 9.2, 8.1, and 9.6 days. Susceptibility tests performed with the isolates from patients A and B with the individual component antibiotics of PANTA and testing of four of the other isolates with nalidixic acid alone suggested that nalidixic acid exerts some degree of inhibition on the growth of M. kansasii. The eight patient isolates were also inoculated onto Lowenstein Jensen medium (Remel) and onto a variety of selective mycobacterial media containing nalidixic acid and other antimicrobial agents. All isolates showed some degree of inhibition on at least one of these selective media.
