Mycobacterium smegmatis DSM43756 inactivates rifampin, and the inactivated antibiotic product recovered from culture medium was ribosylated on the 23-OH group. To study this process, the gene responsible for the inactivation was expressed at high levels by the lac promoter in Escherichia coli conferring resistance to >500 microg of antibiotic per ml. Cell homogenates generated a novel derivative designated RIP-TAs; in this study, we determined that RIP-TAs is 23-(O-ADP-ribosyl)rifampin. Our results indicated that RIP-TAs is an intermediate in the pathway leading to ribosylated rifampin and that the previously characterized gene encodes a mono(ADP-ribosyl)transferase which, however, shows no sequence similarity to other enzymes of this class.
