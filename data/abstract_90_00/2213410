A strain of Plasmodium brasilianum was isolated from a naturally infected Saimiri monkey from Peru and subsequently passaged to 21 splenectomized Saimiri sciureus boliviensis monkeys. Nine of 12 attempts to transmit infection by sporozoite inoculation were successful with prepatent periods ranging from 23 to 41 days. Gametocytes were infective to Anopheles freeborni, Anopheles stephensi, Anopheles dirus, Anopheles maculatus, and Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes. The strain demonstrated a high level of resistance to cure with chloroquine.
