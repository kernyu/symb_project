AIM: To assess the sensitivity of Plasmodium falciparum to four antimalarials. METHODS: WHO standard in vitro microtest was used. RESULTS: The resistance rates of the malaria parasite to chloroquine, piperaquine pyronaridine and artesunate were 85.7%, 66.7%, 38.1% and 5.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Among the antimalarials tested in Yuxi Prefecture, Yunnan Province, high resistance of P. falciparum to chloroquine and piperaquine was found. The sensitivity of P. falciparum in part of the cases to pyronaridine decreased. However, most of the cases were relatively sensitive to artesunate.
