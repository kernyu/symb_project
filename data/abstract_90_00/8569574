OBJECTIVE: To assess the changes in antibiotic resistances in Staphylococcus aureus, both methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant strains, in Australia. DESIGN: Retrospective review of data collected annually. SETTING: Twenty metropolitan teaching hospitals in the six States of Australia and the Australian Capital Territory from 1988 to 1994. OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in prevalence and resistance rates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-susceptible strains, based on antibiotic susceptibility testing of clinical isolates of S. aureus. RESULTS: Prevalence of MRSA has remained constant on the eastern seaboard of Australia. A distinctive strain of MRSA emerged in Western Australia which had different antimicrobial susceptibilities. Resistances emerged in MRSA strains from eastern Australia, principally to ciprofloxacin and rifampicin, while resistance to fusidic acid remained stable and resistance to chloramphenicol significantly declined. Resistances in methicillin-susceptible strains remained fairly stable, except for a decline in resistance levels for tetracycline. High levels of resistance were seen to penicillin, moderate levels to erythromycin and low levels to trimethoprim and fusidic acid in methicillin-susceptible strains. CONCLUSIONS: The continued high prevalence of and increasing resistance in MRSA in some Australian hospitals have meant that some strains are now untreatable with oral antibiotics.
