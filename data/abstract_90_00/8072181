Clinical efficacy of arbekacin (ABK) was examined on patients with MRSA infection during hospitalization in Nagoya University Hospital. A total of 15 analysed cases of 5 sepsis, 3 pneumonias, 6 wound infections and one abdominal abscess. ABK was administered intravenously by drip infusion of 200 mg per day divided into 2 doses with or without other antibiotics. Overall clinical efficacy rate was 76.9%, and eradication rate for the MRSA was 54.5%. Adverse effects were noted in 3 cases (one each case of urticaria, disorder of liver function, and renal disorder). The renal disorder was found in the case where ABK was used in combination with vancomycin.
