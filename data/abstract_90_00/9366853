Large papillomatous lesions clinically resembling verrucous carcinoma may be caused by viruses other than human papillomavirus. We report a case of recurrent vegetations covering the entire vulva in a pregnant patient with common variable immunodeficiency. Herpes simplex virus was recovered from these lesions. The patient did not respond to intravenous acyclovir, but her lesions dramatically healed with two courses of intravenous foscarnet. Repeated biopsies may prove necessary in cases such as this to ensure proper diagnoses.
