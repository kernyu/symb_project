Medical and social characteristics of 27 patients deceased in tuberculosis in the Koranyi National Institute for Tuberculosis and Pulmonology, Budapest, were analysed and evaluated. M. tuberculosis strains sensitive to all antituberculotic drugs were isolated from all cases. Characteristics of patients: males over 40 years of age (17 cases), single (9 cases), alcoholics (16 cases) who were transferred from another hospital (13 cases). All patients had pulmonary tuberculosis, in 3 cases together with extrapulmonary lesions. Sputum direct smear examination revealed acid-fast bacteria in 9 cases. There were 8 relapses. It is proposed to consider possibility of tuberculosis in the presence of the above mentioned "risk factors".
