The mechanism of methicillin resistance confers resistance to all available beta-lactam antibiotics; consequently, beta-lactam antibiotics have no role in therapy of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. Vancomycin remains the drug of choice. Teicoplanin and daptomycin are two investigational antibiotics related to vancomycin in structure and in spectrum of activity. In clinical trials employing relatively low doses, neither was as effective as vancomycin. Trials at higher doses are on-going. Quinolones, ciprofloxacin in particular, have been used successfully to treat infections caused by MRSA; however, the usefulness of quinolones may be limited by the tendency of resistance to emerge during therapy. Quinolones probably should be used only in combination with another active agent, such as rifampin, when treating serious infections caused by MRSA. Other agents may be active in vitro against MRSA, but clinical data showing their effectiveness are lacking. Rifampin combination regimens appear most effectively to eradicate colonization with MRSA.
