Several small, achiral nonpeptide inhibitors of HIV-1 protease with low micromolar activity were identified by mass screening of the Parke-Davis compound library. Two of the compounds, structurally similar, were both found to be competitive and reversible inhibitors [compound 1, 4-hydroxy-3-(3-phenoxypropyl)-1-benzopyran-2-one: Ki = 1.0 microM; compound 2, 4-hydroxy-6-phenyl-3-(phenylthio)-pyran-2-one: Ki = 1.1 microM]. These inhibitors were chosen as initial leads for optimization of in vitro inhibitory activity based on molecular modeling and X-ray crystallographic structural data. While improvements in inhibitory potency were small with analogues of compound 1, important X-ray crystallographic structural information of the enzyme-inhibitor complex was gained. When bound, 1 was found to displace H2O301 in the active site while hydrogen bonding to the catalytic Asps and Ile50 and Ile150. The pyranone group of compound 2 was found to bind at the active site in the same manner, with the 6-phenyl and the 3-phenylthio occupying P1 and P1', respectively. The structural information was used to develop design strategies to reach three or four of the internal pockets, P2-P2'. This work led to analogues of diverse structure with high potency (IC50 < 10 nM) that contain either one or no chiral centers and remain nonpeptide. The highly potent compounds possess less anti-HIV activity in cellular assays than expected, and current optimization now focuses on increasing cellular activity. The value of the HIV-1 protease inhibitors described is their potential as better pharmacological agents with a different pattern of viral resistance development, relative to the peptide inhibitors in human clinical trials.
