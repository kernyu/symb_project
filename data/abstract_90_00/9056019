A new member of the polyene family, N-dimethylaminoacetyl-partricin A 2-dimethylaminoethylamide diaspartate (SPA), was investigated and was found to be more effective than amphotericin B (i) in vivo by enhancing mouse resistance to cryptococcal meningoencephalitis and (ii) in vitro by potentiating the anticryptococcal activity of murine microglial cells.
