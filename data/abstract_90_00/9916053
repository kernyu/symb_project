The immunoregulatory cytokine interleukin 12 (IL-12) induces host resistance against experimental malaria. In this study, we tested the feasibility of using IL-12 in combination with chloroquine (CQ) to rescue susceptible A/J mice from lethal blood-stage Plasmodium chabaudi AS infection. Combined treatment with low doses of CQ and IL-12 resulted in a >15-fold reduction in the parasite load and 100% survival of A/J mice with established infections. Compared to control mice, which succumbed to severe anemia, CQ-plus-IL-12-treated mice had significantly higher early- and late-stage erythroid-cell progenitors in the bone marrow and spleen, resulting in significantly higher hematocrits, erythrocyte counts, and percentages of reticulocytes. Production of parasite-specific gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) by splenocytes from these mice was upregulated >20-fold relative to controls in parallel with enhanced IFN-gamma mRNA expression. Further, enhanced responsiveness to IL-12 and increased downstream IFN-gamma production in CQ-plus-IL-12-treated mice was evident from increased mRNA expression for the beta1 and beta2 subunits of IL-12 receptor in the splenocytes. Moreover, this combined therapy induced higher levels of anti-malaria antibodies than did CQ alone as well as sterile immunity against reinfection. Because IL-12 can be used at low doses and is effective even in established infections, it may be feasible to use this immunochemotherapeutic approach in human malaria.
