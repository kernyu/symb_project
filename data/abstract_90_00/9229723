We evaluated the in vitro antiviral activity of meliacin combined with foscarnet on the herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) strains F and B2006 (tk-) replication. The effective concentrations for 50% inhibition of HSV-1 (F) were 12.5 micrograms/ml for meliacin and 15.7 micrograms/ml for foscarnet, while for HSV-1 (B2006) were 3.1 micrograms/ml and 126 micrograms/ml, respectively. The data were analyzed for quantitation of synergism, additivity, and antagonism of multiple drug effect by the three-dimensional model. Some of the meliacin -foscarnet combinations synergistically inhibited HSV-1 (F) and HSV-1 (B2006) replication in vitro at concentrations that did not reduce cellular viability.
