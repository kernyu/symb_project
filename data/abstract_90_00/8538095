A 55-year-old man was admitted to our department one month after resection of rectal carcinoma, with complaints of fever and general malaise. Shock developed rapidly after admission. The chest X-ray film and computed tomography showed diffuse small nodular shadows and bilateral pleural effusion. Septic lung caused by Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) was diagnosed from the results of a bacteriological study. This bacteria is a Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus (CNS). Chemotherapy with Minocycline and Cefotiam was effective. Characteristic radiologic features of this case may be related to the early stage of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and septic pulmonary microembolism.
