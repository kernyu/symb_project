Beta-lactamase production is one of the major mechanisms of resistance amongst bacteria especially the enteric bacilli. The purpose of this study is to assess the in-vitro activity of Sulperazon, a combination of cefoperazone and an irreversible beta-lactamase inhibitor, sulbactam, against the cefoperazone resistant isolates of aerobic gram-negative bacilli. A total of 92 such strains were tested. It was found that at a concentration of < or = 8 mg/l of sulbactam added to cefoperazone 82% of Klebsiella spp, 100% of E. coli, 100% of Enterobacter spp, 33% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 67% of Pseudomonas spp and 62% of Acinetobacter spp that were resistant to cefoperazone alone were susceptible to the combination. Hence it is concluded that the addition of sulbactam to cefoperazone does expand the spectrum of the in-vitro activity of cefoperazone.
