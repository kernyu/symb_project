Quinolones 7a-i and 8a-i were synthesized and tested in vitro as antimalarial against Plasmodium falciparum in chloroquine resistant strain. The above compounds were inactive at concentrations of 1.0 x 10(-4) M except the quinolone 3-amino-9-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]-4-quinolone 7h which showed IC50 of 5.06 microM given the most interesting results.
