A 25-kDa outer membrane protein, induced following treatment of Vibrio cholerae cells with beta-lactam antibiotics and constituting about 8-10% of the total outer membrane proteins of beta-lactam-resistant mutants, has been purified to homogeneity. It is a basic (pI 8.5) protein rich in beta-sheet structure and is a homodimer, the monomers being held together by hydrophobic interactions. The effective hydrophobicity of the protein is low, and a large part of the protein is exposed on the surface of the outer membrane. The protein does not have beta-lactamase or autolytic activity and is not a penicillin-binding protein. The Stoke's radius of the 25-kDa protein (26 A) is comparable to the pore size of the V. cholerae OmpF-like porin. Proteoliposome swelling assay showed that the 25-kDa protein might block the pores of OmpF through which beta-lactam antibiotics normally enter the cells. Twenty-two amino acid residues from the N-terminal end of the 25-kDa protein have been sequenced, and a 32-mer oligonucleotide probe was synthesized using the amino acid residues 2-12. This probe was used to identify the gene encoding the 25-kDa protein. The beta-lactam-resistant cells are insensitive to changes in the osmolarity of the growth medium in contrast to the wild type cells which exhibit osmoregulation of OmpF and OmpC synthesis. All beta-lactam-resistant mutants examined are resistant to novobiocin.
