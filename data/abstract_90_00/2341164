Effect of ethambutol (EMB) on phospholipid composition and metabolism of EMB-susceptible and EMB-resistant strains of M. smegmatis ATCC 607 was studied. Treatment with ethambutol had different effect in both the strains resulting in decreased total phospholipid and cardiolipin content in EMB-susceptible strain and increased content in EMB-resistant strain, with no effect on fatty acyl group composition. These changes were further corroborated by the use of [1-14C]sodium acetate in these studies.
