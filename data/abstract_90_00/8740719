Interferons (IFNs) have been shown to enhance both in vitro and in vivo the antiproliferative activity of some hormones and anti-hormones which mainly act via steroid receptors. We discuss some of the mechanisms which could be involved in determining this effect in breast, endometrial and prostatic cancer cells, with a particular emphasis on steroid receptor modulation, reduction of the expression of epidermal growth factor receptors and, finally, down-regulation of some oncogenes. It seems that under appropriate conditions IFN might produce changes in cancer cells that enhance or restore hormone sensitivity. Nevertheless, available clinical data are too few to allow any conclusion to be drawn and this problem merits further investigations.
