The in-vitro susceptibilities of a total of 174 ciprofloxacin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were determined. According to the BSAC and NCCLS breakpoints, meropenem, aztreonam, ceftibuten, ceftazidime, imipenem and cefotaxime were the most active (> 90%) antimicrobial agents tested against Enterobacteriaceae. Susceptibility of these strains to piperacillin/tazobactam, cefpodoxime and cefixime (84.96%) was higher than that to tobramycin, gentamicin and fosfomycin (50-75%). More than 90% of P. aeruginosa were susceptible to meropenem when both interpretative susceptibility breakpoint criteria were used. Piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftazidime were active against 50-75% of the same strains. Meropenem was the most active antimicrobial tested against all ciprofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates assayed.
