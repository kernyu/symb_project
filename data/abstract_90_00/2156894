The T84 human colonic epithelial cell line retains the ability to produce secretagogue-responsive monolayer cultures with high transepithelial resistance when grown and maintained on collagen-coated permeable supports in media supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum. The addition of highly purified insulin to the basolateral but not the apical membrane side of established monolayers caused the transepithelial resistance to decline more than eightfold over a 3-4-d period. By comparing the transepithelial flux of 22Na with that of the extracellular space marker, [3H]mannitol, the decline in electrical resistance was shown to be due solely to an effect on tight junction-mediated paracellular permeability. The effect of insulin was dose dependent with a half-maximal effect at 3.9 ng/ml (approximately 0.7 nM) and fully reversible over a 10-d time course. Simultaneous addition of 2 microM cycloheximide prevented the insulin-induced decline in resistance; in fact, this combination caused a significant increase in electrical resistance. There was no effect on the short-circuit current response of insulin-treated monolayers to secretagogues so long as media was changed daily. While no gross morphological changes were apparent, there did appear to be a subtle condensation of the perijunctional actin ring as visualized using rhodamine-labeled phalloidin. These results demonstrate that insulin modulates the permeability of the occluding junction in T84 cell monolayers through a receptor mediated process which probably involves changes in protein synthesis and cytoskeletal structure. Insulin was also shown to produce similar effects on two other intestinal epithelial cell lines.
