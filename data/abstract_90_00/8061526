Here, we present an analysis of clinical and biological data from 15 infantile visceral leishmaniasis recorded between 1985 and 1992 in the French department of Alpes-Maritimes. The association of fever, splenomegalia, tricytopenia remains the most constant and predictive of diagnosis (90% of cases). Bone marrow smear affirms diagnosis in 93% of cases. Leishmania infantum MON-1 is the causative agent. Except for one case of advanced stade with severe hepatic lesions and one case of clinical resistance to Glucantime, prognosis is favourable under treatment with antimony derivatives. The long term results for children considered cured after initial treatment is satisfactory. In the department, the number of cases of combined ages has increased regularly since 1985. The number of infantile forms has increased but now represents nevertheless no more than 28% of total cases. On the other hand, cases are increasing in adults and 40% of those adult cases are in HIV positive patients.
