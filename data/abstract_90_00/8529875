The genes for the production of elloramycin (ELM) from Streptomyces olivaceus (So) Tu2353 were cloned using a polyketide synthase gene probe from the tetracenomycin pathway. A cosmid clone (16F4) isolated from a gene library of So Tu2353 conferred tetracenomycin C and ELM resistance to S. lividans TK64 and complemented a mutation in So Tu2353R. Introduction of cosmid 16F4 into S. lividans TK64 resulted in the production of 8-demethyl-tetracenomycin C, an intermediate of ELM biosynthesis.
