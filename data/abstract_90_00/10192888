This is a general overview on the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) with particular emphasis on controversial aspects. The importance of avoiding treatment for asymptomatic patients is emphasized. The selection of initial treatment (melphalan/prednisone vs. combination chemotherapy) is summarized. The duration of initial treatment, the role of interferon maintenance, as well as the treatment of resistant myeloma patients are critically reviewed. Finally, the treatment of particular subsets of myeloma patients (i.e., young patients, elderly people, patients presenting with renal failure) is discussed.
