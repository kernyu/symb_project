Brain heart infusion-6-micrograms/ml vancomycin agar plates obtained from five commercial sources (B-D Microbiology Systems, Carr-Scarborough Microbiologicals, MicroBio Products, PML Microbiologicals, and REMEL) were evaluated with 714 enterococci for detection of vancomycin resistance. All 465 (100%) vancomycin-resistant enterococci (MIC > or = 32 micrograms/ml) were detected by each manufacturer's agar screen plate, and each manufacturer's agar screen plate detected at least 99% of the 177 vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (MIC < or = 4 micrograms/ml). Detection of the 72 vancomycin-intermediate enterococci (MIC = 6 to 16 micrograms/ml) ranged from 94% for B-D Microbiology Systems to 99% for PML Microbiologicals.
