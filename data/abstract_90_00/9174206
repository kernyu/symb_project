Serum bactericidal activity against a penicillin-susceptible strain and a penicillin-resistant strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae (amoxicillin and cefotaxime MICs, 0.001 and 1 microg/ml, respectively, and MBCs, 0.01 and 2 microg/ml, respectively) was measured in 12 healthy volunteers who each received an oral 875-mg dose of amoxicillin and an intramuscular 1-g dose of cefotaxime in a crossover fashion. The areas under the bactericidal activity-time curves for the two strains were found to be similar for both antibiotics despite the significantly higher (P < 0.002) AUC/MIC and peak level/MIC values for cefotaxime.
