OBJECTIVE: To investigate the isolation rate and drug susceptibility of PRSP in Guangzhou and in vitro antimicrobial activities of 8 antimicrobial agents against PRSP. METHODS: MICs were tested by E-test. RESULTS: Of 102 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 12 strains were low-level resistant against penicillin (isolation rate 11.8%) and the antimicrobial activites of 5 drugs (augmentin, cefaclor, ceftriaxone, cefuraxime, ofloxaxin) against them were within their MICs, augmentin and ceftriaxone being the most powerful. They were resistant to azithromicin, oxacillin and penicillin. CONCLUSIONS: The isolation rate of Penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae was not high in Guangzhou, but it may increase with the extensive use of antimicrobial agents, which deserves much attention.
