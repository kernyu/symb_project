The classical treatment of severe forms of dermatomyositis includes high doses of steroids and/or cytotoxic agents. Acute forms are frequently life threatening. Because cyclosporine is a fast-acting immunosuppressive drug, it appears to be a good candidate for the treatment of refractory forms of acute dermatomyositis. We report a dramatic improvement of a severe, acute, steroid-resistant adult form after cyclosporine administration. A rapid clinical and biochemical improvement is reported, and the reversibility of immunologic abnormalities is emphasized.
