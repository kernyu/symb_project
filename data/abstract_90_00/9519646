Along with other multidrug-resistant pathogens previously identified, Streptococcus pneumoniae is becoming a serious concern in hospital and ambulatory care settings.

Antimicrobial drug resistance involves three molecular mechanisms drug inactivation, altered cell permeability, and alteration of target sites. Surveillance and multidisciplinary approaches will be key to containing the threat of global antimicrobial resistance.
