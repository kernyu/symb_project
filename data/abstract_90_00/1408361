Enterococci are potential pathogens in many human body sites. This study determined the subgingival occurrence and the in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococci in 100 persons with early-onset periodontitis and 545 persons with advanced adult periodontitis. Subgingival microbial samples were collected with paper points, transported in VMGA III and plated onto anaerobic enriched brucella blood agar or selective Enterococcosel agar (BBL Microbiology Systems). Enterococcal speciation was performed using commercial micromethod kit systems. In vitro sensitivity was determined using a commercial kit system and an agar dilution assay. Subgingival enterococci occurred in 1% of early-onset periodontitis patients and in approximately 5% of adult periodontitis patients. Enterococcus faecalis was the only enterococcal species recovered, and all but one isolate belonged to the same biotype. In vitro antimicrobial sensitivity testing revealed subgingival enterococci resistant to therapeutic levels of penicillin G, tetracycline, clindamycin and metronidazole, but relatively sensitive to ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin/potassium clavulanate (Augmentin). Enterococci may populate periodontal pockets as superinfecting organisms and, in heavily infected patients, may contribute to periodontal breakdown.
