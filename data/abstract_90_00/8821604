Surveillance by 33 laboratories in 19 states during a 4 1/2 month period between December 1993 and April 1994 found that 263 of 1627 (16.2%) isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae were resistant to penicillin. One hundred and seventy (10.4%) isolates were determined to be intermediately resistant to penicillin (MICs 0.1-1.0 mg/L and 93 (5.7%) were found to be highly resistant to penicillin (MICs > 2.0 mg/L). MIC90s for intermediately penicillin resistant strains were: amoxycillin/clavulanate 2.0 mg/L, cefaclor 64 mg/L, cefixime 32 mg/L, cefprozil 8 mg/L and loracarbef 128 mg/L. MIC90s for highly penicillin resistant strains were: amoxycillin/clavulanate 4.0 mg/L, cefaclor > or = 128 mg/L cefixime 64 mg/L, cefprozil 32 mg/L and loracarbef > or = 128 mg/L.
