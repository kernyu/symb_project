From simplified in vivo tests, authors set up a cartography of the sensitivity of Plasmodium falciparum to amino-4-quinolines in Cameroon; they also evaluated the clinical and parasitological efficacy of different therapeutic protocols which make use of amino-4-quinolines, quinine, mefloquine and halofantrine. All these drugs are administered orally. They recommend maintaining home medication with chloroquine at the dose of 25 mg/kg over 3 days, conserving quinine for use in the case of a possible failure. The use of most recent antimalarials can be proposed only as a last resort.
