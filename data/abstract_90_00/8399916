Mycoplasmas are susceptible to antimicrobial agents that affect DNA, RNA, protein synthesis, or the integrity of the cell membrane. Mycoplasmas are not susceptible to agents that interfere with synthesis of folic acid or that act on the cell wall. Tetracyclines, erythromycin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones have been shown to have activity against one or more mycoplasmal species. Tetracycline-resistant isolates of Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum contain DNA sequences homologous to the streptococcal determinant tetM. Resistance to tetracycline in vitro is associated with failure of tetracycline treatment to eradicate M. hominis and U. urealyticum from the human urogenital tract.
