The Pseudomonas syringae cyclic lipodepsipeptide syringomycin inhibits the growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A novel yeast gene, SYR2, was found to complement two syringomycin-resistant S. cerevisiae mutants. SYR2 was cloned, sequenced, and shown to encode a 349 amino acid protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum. SYR2 was identical to SUR2, which is involved in survival during nutritional starvation. Gene disruption or overexpression of SYR2 did not affect cell viability or ergosterol levels, but did influence cellular phospholipid levels. The findings suggest that phospholipids are important for the growth inhibitory action of syringomycin.
