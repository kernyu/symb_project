Because of the popularity of some third-generation cephalosporins, emergence of resistant organisms (e.g., selected Enterobacteriaceae) that produce inducible and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases has been a problem. Cefepime's twice-a-day dosage schedule and enhanced activity against Enterobacteriaceae and gram-positive organisms give it several advantages over older drugs. The clinical efficacy of cefepime has been demonstrated in comparative and noncomparative trials in the United States and Europe. Cefepime with twice-daily dosing has been useful in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, skin and skin structure infections, and in serious infection, including those with associated bacteremia. Cefepime is comparable to ceftazidime in clinical and bacteriologic response rates when both agents are administered three times a day in febrile neutropenic patients. Cefepime is also active against organisms that show resistance to other agents. Several studies have shown that cefepime retains its activity against E. cloacae and E. coli strains resistant to other cephalosporins and against many strains of P. aeruginosa resistant to ceftazidime. Cefepime exhibits a low level of cross-resistance with third-generation cephalosporins and a low propensity for selection of resistant mutants and offers a low potential for the induction of bacterial resistance, which complicates the course of many patients treated with single-agent third-generation therapy. Cefepime should be used in place of ceftazidime based on resistance potential, activity against resistant organisms, and cost.
