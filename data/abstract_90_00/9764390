The motile enterococci with the vanC gene have intrinsic low-level resistance to vancomycin, but have not been implicated in a nosocomial outbreak. We determined the colonization rate of motile enterococci in hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients. Perianal or stool specimens were cultured in Enterococcosel broth supplemented with 6 micrograms of vancomycin per mL. Rapid motility and pigment tests were performed on all enterococci isolated. A total of 82 motile and/or pigmented enterococci were isolated from 679 patients for a colonization rate of 12.1%. There were 43 Enterococcus gallinarum, 32 Enterococcus casseliflavus, 4 Enterococcus flavescens, and 3 Enterococcus mundtii identified. The E. gallinarum vancomycin MIC90 was 32 micrograms/mL and the E. casseliflavus vancomycin MIC90 was 8 micrograms/mL.
