OBJECTIVE: To determine the evolution of the frequencies of Salmonella enterica serotypes and their resistance to antimicrobial agents. METHOD: A retrospective study of all S. enterica strains isolated from stool samples in the Hospital Clinico Universitario of Zaragoza over the period 1990-1994. RESULTS: Enteritidis was the most frequently isolated serotype (62.9%), although it showed a progressive decrease (from 76.2% in 1990 to 39.8% in 1994). Typhimurium was the serotype showing the highest resistance levels, 37.1% of its isolates being resistant to ampicillin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol and tetracyclin. There was a distinct increase in the frequency of multiresistant strains, from 9.7% in 1990 to 22.9% in 1994. Of 88 such strains, 78.4% corresponded to serogroup B, whereas only 4.5% to serogroup D. Of the antimicrobial agents traditionally considered elective, only cotrimoxazole maintained acceptable resistance levels (4.4%). Resistance to fluoroquinolones or 3rd-generation cephalosporines was not detected. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing frequency of Typhimurium, a highly resistant serotype, restrains the elective antimicrobial agents to cotrimoxazole in children and fluoroquinolones in adults. 3rd-generation cefalosporines may be a good alternative in case of therapeutic failure.
