Seven clinical isolates of Shigella sonnei with reduced susceptibilities to fluoroquinolones (sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin) were obtained. The MICs of fluoroquinolones against these S. sonnei strains were 16 to 32 times higher than those obtained against typical strains that are highly susceptible to these agents. The kinetics of [14C]ofloxacin accumulation in these clinical strains were not different from those in the fully susceptible strains. However, DNA synthesis was much less inhibited by ofloxacin in the strains with reduced susceptibility. Analysis of the in vitro activity of the partially purified DNA gyrase from these isolates showed that the decreased quinolone susceptibility of the S. sonnei strains was likely due to mutation of the DNA gyrase subunit A gene.
