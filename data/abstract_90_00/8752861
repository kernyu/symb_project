Escherichia coli isolated from surgical infections during the period from July 1983 to June 1995 were investigated in a multicenter study involving 19 hospitals in Japan, and the following results were obtained. 1. Although the isolation rate of E. coli was not high from postoperative infections, it was most frequently isolated from primary infections throughout the study period. E. coli, Klebsiella spp. and anaerobic bacteria were predominant from fresh infections. From the cases that had previous antibiotics treatment, Enterococcus spp. were the most predominant isolates followed by MRSA and Pseudomonas spp. in this order. 2. Against E. coli, cefozopran, carumonam and aztreonam had the strongest activity, followed by cefmenoxime, imipenem, latamoxef, gentamicin and ofloxacin. Recently, we have noticed that antibiotic resistant E. coli strains particularly against cefazolin are increasing year by year.
