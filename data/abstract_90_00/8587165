In order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefepime (CFPM), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of CFPM and other drugs were determined against clinical isolates that were obtained in 1994. 1. CFPM showed a wide antibacterial spectrum against Staphylococcus spp. and glucose non-fermentative Gram-negative rods ((G)NF-GNR). Antimicrobial activities of CFPM against Staphylococcus spp. were stronger than those of ceftazidime (CAZ) and somewhat stronger than those of cefotaxime (CTX), and antimicrobial activity of CFPM against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was same as that of CAZ. 2. Antimicrobial activities of CFPM against almost all of Enterobacteriaceae were stronger than those of CAZ and CTX. And CFPM showed strong antimicrobial activities against CAZ-resistant Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter spp. 3. Antimicrobial activities of CFPM were weaker than those of CAZ against some of strains of Klebsiella oxytoca, beta-lactamase high producing strains of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis and than those of CTX against beta-lactamase high producing strains of Prevotella spp. 4. The feature of new cephems was demonstrated in that CFPM had wider antibacterial spectrum than cephems of previous genenations against Staphylococcus spp. and (G)NF-GNR and CFPM showed strong antimicrobial activities against almost all of oxacephem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae.
