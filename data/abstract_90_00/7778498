Authors describe the frequency and properties of mutants resistant to ketoconazole, obtained from the dermatophytes Microsporum gypseum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. Spontaneous mutants occurred with the frequency of 10(-9) to spore and nucleus. Ultraviolet radiation increased the frequency of mutants by two numeric orders. The resistance level was relatively small in both types of mutants (RL within the range of 2-5).
