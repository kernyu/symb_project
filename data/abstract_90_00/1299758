In vivo measurements of P. falciparum sensitivity to chloroquine diphosphate, carried out in the Republic of Guinea, resulted in isolation of strains with degrees I and II resistance from 5 of the 25 examined patients, that may be due to a wide prophylactic administration of the drug to all patients with fevers without completing the course of therapy in all the patients infected. Such courses are obligatory to prevent the dissemination of chloroquine-resistant strains of the parasite and augmentation of the resistance. Further use of chloroquine and its analogs for the prevention and chemoprophylaxis of malaria in the Republic of Guinea appears still desirable, because the majority of P. falciparum strains are still sensitive to these agents. If no favorable changes are detectable in the clinical parameters of malaria patients in 4-5 days of chloroquine treatment or the condition recurs in 1.5-2 months, assessment of P. falciparum sensitivity to chloroquine is advisable, followed by a rational choice of the drug.
