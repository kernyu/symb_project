The sensitivity of a bacterium to beta-lactam antibiotics depends upon the interplay between 3 independent factors: the sensitivity of the essential penicillin-binding enzyme(s), the quantity and properties of the beta-lactamase(s) and the diffusion barrier that the outer-membrane of Gram-negative bacteria can represent. Those three factors can be modified by mutations or by the horizontal transfer of genes or portions of genes.
