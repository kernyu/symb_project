Sixty-two Aeromonas strains (39 of clinical and 23 of environmental origin) were identified. The suicide phenomenon and autoagglutination were studied. Identification is based on esculin hydrolysis; fermentation of arabinose salicin, sucrose and mannitol; gas production from glucose, indole and beta hemolysis; Voges-Proskauer and decarboxylation reactions; and finally resistance to cephalothin (30 micrograms) and colistin (4 micrograms/ml). Thirty-four per cent of A hydrophila, 33% A caviae, 28% A veronii subspecies sobria, 3% A jandaei, 2% A veronii subspecies veronii were accurately identified. Also, several new species were identified such as A trota, A enteropelogenes, A schubertii, A ichthiosmia, according to the more recently proposed taxa. This identification scheme could enhance our knowledge concerning virulence factors, pathogenicity and environmental distribution.
