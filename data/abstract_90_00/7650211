S1, a new chromogenic cephalosporin (International BioClinical, Inc., Portland, Oreg.), was used to detect beta-lactamase production among a variety of commonly encountered bacteria in a four-center collaborative study. Results of an S1 disk assay were compared with those obtained by a nitrocefin-based disk procedure (Cefinase; Becton-Dickinson Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, Md.), with repetitive testing of five quality control organisms and with individual tests of recent clinical isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (162 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (162 strains), Moraxella catarrhalis (155 strains), Staphylococcus aureus (161 strains), and Bacteroides fragilis (164 strains). The performances of the two beta-lactamase disk assays were comparable for the first three species cited above. However, the S1 assay appeared to be a more sensitive procedure than the Cefinase assay when applied to S. aureus and B. fragilis, with respect to both total numbers of positive results and length of time to a definitive positive endpoint.
