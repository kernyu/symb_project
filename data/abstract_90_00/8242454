Environmental mastitis affects all dairy farms and generally is the major mastitis problem on modern, well managed dairy farms. Control measures effective against contagious pathogens are of little value in controlling of environmental pathogens. Control of environmental mastitis is achieved by reducing exposure of teat ends to environmental pathogens and by maximizing the resistance of the cow to intramammary infection. Significant sources of environmental pathogens are organic bedding materials, manure covered alleyways, and wet or damp areas in barns, exercise lots, or pastures. Milking time hygiene can influence teat-end exposure. In general, exposure is minimized when all areas of the environment are clean, cool, and dry. Resistance is maximized by providing a stress-free environment that minimizes teat-end injury, and by feeding balanced diets sufficient in vitamin E and selenium. Antibiotic therapy during lactation or the dry period is of little value in the control of environmental mastitis in dairy herds, with the exception of preventing environmental streptococcal infection during the early dry period. Effective vaccines may help reduce the impact of environmental mastitis in the near future.
