The sensibility of 375 pasteurellae of bovine origin (215 pasteurella multocida--and 160 pasteurella haemolytica--strains) was examined against 16 antibiotics or chemotherapeutics by agar diffusion technique. A great part of the strains was resistant to oxacillin (41,18%), tylosin (79,14%), streptomycin (53,21%), sulfonamides (57,33%) and tetracycline (47,20%). Only a few resistant strains were found for cephalothin (5,07%), polymyxin B (0,27%) and enrofloxacin (0,53%). While 16,27% of all isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol, 100% of the pasteurella strains proved to be sensible to its structural analogon florfenicol. This is affirmed by the low minimal inhibitory concentrations (0,25-1,0 micrograms/ml) of this antibiotic.
