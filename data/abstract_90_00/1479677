The in vitro antimicrobial activity of AO-128, an inhibitor of alpha-D-glucosidase, was evaluated against anaerobic bacteria of 45 reference strains (12 genera, 44 species). AO-128 inhibited no strains tested at a concentration of 1,600 micrograms/ml. The results strongly suggested that this compound would not have any influence on the human intestinal microflora, a majority of which is composed of anaerobic bacteria.
