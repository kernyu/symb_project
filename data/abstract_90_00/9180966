We describe a multiresistant Enterobacter aerogenes outbreak in an intensive care-unit. An epidemiology study based on phenotypic characters (species diagnosis and antibiotype) was completed by a genotypic study (pulsed field electrophoresis) to confirm bacterial clonality. The hygiene laboratory proposed numerous preventive measures to limit bacterial dispersion. We describe the role of bacteriologists, hygienists and medical staff to stop the bacterial dispersion.
