The activity of sparfloxacin (CI-978; AT-4140) was compared with those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. All 10 ciprofloxacin-resistant staphylococci had reduced susceptibility to sparfloxacin and ofloxacin. Against 105 ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains of S. aureus, the sparfloxacin MIC for 90% of strains tested was at least fourfold lower than those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, while against 104 ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains of S. epidermidis, the MIC of sparfloxacin for 90% of strains tested was twofold lower than that of ciprofloxacin and fourfold lower than that of ofloxacin. MBCs of sparfloxacin were less than or equal to 4 x MICs. The effects of inoculum size and pH variations, as well as the presence of serum, on the MICs of sparfloxacin were minimal. Subinhibitory concentrations of sparfloxacin did reduce adherence of S. epidermidis.
