Rapamycin (Rm) is a macrolide antifungal agent related to FK506 that exhibits potent immunosuppressive properties which are mediated through interaction with specific cytoplasmic receptors (FKBPs or RBPs, for FK506- and Rm-binding proteins, respectively). These proteins possess peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) activity in vitro which is inhibited by the binding of Rm and FK506. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rm sensitivity (Rms) is mediated by binding of the drug to RBP1, a homolog of the 12-kDa human FK506-binding protein (FKBP12); null mutations in the yeast RBP1 gene result in a recessive drug resistance phenotype. To identify missense mutations that define amino acid (aa) residues in RBP1 involved in drug sensitivity, we selected and genetically characterized over 250 independent RmR rbp1 mutants and screened them for both RBP1-specific mRNA and protein expression. Whereas all rbp1 mutants expressed abundant levels of RBP1 mRNA, stable RBP1 protein production was detected in only one mutant strain. The RBP1 gene was PCR-generated (in triplicate) from several rbp1 mutants and independent clones were sequenced. Most of the immunoblot-negative alleles were found to contain various types of null mutations; however, some alleles contained specific missense mutations that apparently affect protein stability in vivo. The single immunoblot-positive allele was found to contain a mutation altering a specific residue (Tyr89) which is conserved among the known FKBPs, and which, based on the solution and x-ray structures of human FKBP12, has been proposed to be part of a hydrophobic drug-binding pocket for FK506 and Rm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
