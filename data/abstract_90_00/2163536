Lactobacillus sp. strain 100-33 is resistant to macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B-type antibiotics (MLSR) and appears to contain several major and minor plasmids. One of these plasmids, pLAR33, is approximately 18 kbp in size. When cells of strain 100-33 were protoplasted and regenerated, an MLSS isolate was derived. The derivative, designated strain ES1, contained a unique plasmid complement in which it had apparently lost the major plasmids of the parental strain, including pLAR33, and retained only a minor plasmid seen in low concentrations in strain 100-33. The MLSR determinant was cloned from plasmid DNA of strain 100-33 on a 3-kbp EcoRV fragment into pBR322 and localized to pLAR33. The determinant expressed macrolide and lincosamide resistance in Escherichia coli HB101, was localized to approximately 1 kbp on the cloned sequence, and is apparently under the control of its own promoter. MLSR electroporants were derived from strain ES1 electroporated with plasmid DNA from strain 100-33; these MLSR isolates had acquired a plasmid complement similar to that of strain 100-33, including pLAR33. Endonuclease digestion and Southern analysis of plasmid DNA from both strains indicated that the major plasmids are multimeric and deleted forms of one archetypal extrachromosomal element.
