The development of new antiviral strategies for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B remains a major goal since hepatitis virus (HBV) is resistant to interferon treatment as well as to new nucleoside analogs. HBV is a small DNA virus that replicates its genome via a reverse transcription step. The viral polymerase has been the main viral target that was studied to design new antiviral treatments. Active research has led to the discovery of new nucleoside analogs that are potent inhibitors of the viral reverse transcriptase. Among them, lamivudine has also proven antiviral efficacy in clinical trials with a sustained inhibition of viral replication. However, due to the kinetics of viral clearance, long-term antiviral therapy is necessary to eradicate viral infection. These prolonged regimens are associated with the emergence of drug-resistant strains that harbor mutations in the viral polymerase gene within the conserved B and C domains. New approaches using combinations of nucleoside analogs or other strategies, such as immune intervention (DNA vaccine, stimulation of the TH1 response ) or gene therapy (antisense oligonucleotides, dominant negative mutants), should therefore be evaluated in animal models to optimize the current antiviral protocols.
