BACKGROUND/AIMS: Inoculation of ascitic fluid into conventional blood culture bottles is more sensitive than conventional culture in the diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. BacT/ALERT is an automated colorimetric microbial detection system that has been shown to be faster than conventional blood culture bottles in the diagnosis of bacteremia. The aim of the study was to compare the BacT/ALERT system with the conventional culture and the conventional blood culture bottles method in the diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. METHODS: All the ascitic fluid samples from patients with cirrhosis hospitalized in our Department between September 1992 and May 1994 (n=1032) were prospectively evaluated. In all cases, an aliquot of ascitic fluid was sent for Gram's stain and conventional culture, and 20 ml were inoculated at the bedside into blood culture bottles: 10 ml into conventional blood culture bottles and 10 ml into BacT/ALERT. RESULTS: Thirty ascitic fluid infections (23 spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and 7 neutrocytic ascites) and 20 bacterascites were diagnosed. Conventional culture was positive in 10/30 ascitic fluid infections (33.3%), conventional blood culture bottles in 22/30 (73.3%) (p<0.01 compared to conventional culture) and BacT/ALERT in 20/30 (66.6%) (p<0.05 compared to conventional culture, pNS compared to conventional blood culture bottles). The time elapsed for culture positivity was 43.4+/-34.2 h for conventional blood culture bottles and 13.3+/-9.2 h for BacT/ALERT (p<0.001). Thirteen of the 23 cases of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (56.5%) were detected within the first 12 h with BacT/ALERT, as compared to only three (13%) with conventional blood culture bottles (p<0.03). CONCLUSION: The automated system BacT/ALERT provides an earlier microbiologic diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis than conventional blood culture bottles with similar sensitivity.
