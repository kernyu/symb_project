Many multidrug-resistant transposons found in natural isolates of Gram-negative bacteria are close relatives of Tn21. Thus, the Tn21 subgroup of the Tn3 family of transposable elements is the most successful homogeneous group in acquiring resistance to newly introduced antibiotics. This paper summarizes the mode of acquisition of resistance genes by these elements.
