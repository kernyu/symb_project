Cell extracts of Streptomyces antibioticus, an oleandomycin producer, can inactivate oleandomycin in the presence of UDP-glucose. The inactivation can be detected through the loss of biological activity or by alteration in the chromatographic mobility of the antibiotic. This enzyme activity also inactivates other macrolides (rosaramicin, methymycin, and lankamycin) which contain a free 2'-OH group in a monosaccharide linked to the lactone ring (with the exception of erythromycin), but not those which contain a disaccharide (tylosin, spiramycin, carbomycin, josamycin, niddamycin, and relomycin). Interestingly, the culture supernatant contains another enzyme activity capable of reactivating the glycosylated oleandomycin and regenerating the biological activity through the release of a glucose molecule. It is proposed that these two enzyme activities could be an integral part of the oleandomycin biosynthetic pathway.
