The hydroxynaphthoquinone, atovaquone (Wellvone, Glaxo-Wellcome Ltd.) was found to have significant activity against Babesia microti, the main cause of human babesiosis in the U.S.A. This activity compares well with that of the most effective babesicide currently available for use in animals, imidocarb dipropionate, that unlike atovaquone is not licensed for use in humans. Treatment with well tolerated doses of atovaquone results in a rapid reduction in parasitemias and an early disappearance of parasites from blood smears. However, in common with all the other babesicides tested, atovaquone did not sterilize gerbils of infection, even at very high daily doses administered for up to 10 days. A combination of atovaquone and clindamycin was more effective than atovaquone alone in the treatment of both acute and chronic infections but failed to eliminate parasites completely.
