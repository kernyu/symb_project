A total of 74 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 18 strains of Ps. putrefaciens were tested for sensitivity to 14 different antimicrobial agents. Ps. aeruginosa were mostly sensitive to netilmicin (81%), piperacillin (78%), amikacin (73%), azlocillin (70%), ceftazidime (69%) and pefloxacin (65%). Only 66 per cent strains of Ps. putrefaciens were sensitive to netilmicin, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone. The MIC values of the different drugs for the sensitive strains were comparable with the results of susceptibility testing. The Ps. putrefaciens strains showed greater resistance than Ps. aeruginosa.
