Two hundred and seventy-seven multidrug resistant clinical isolates [K. pneumoniae, (N = 87); E coli, (N = 30); Salmonella typhimurium (N = 100); P. aeruginosa, (N = 30); S. aureus, (N = 30)] from hospitalized patients specimens, were tested in vitro for sensitivity to Ciprofloxacin. Application of the disk diffusion test and determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration by the microdilution method indicated that, almost all isolates were sensitive to the drug. Overall, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa were the less sensitive organisms. Ciprofloxacin-resistant mutants occurred at frequencies of > or = 10(-5)/CFU.
