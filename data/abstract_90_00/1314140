The nature of extra-chromosomal maintenance of the transforming plasmid p12-6 in Phanerochaete chrysosporium was studied. Our results indicate that the plasmid is maintained in the fungal transformants extra-chromosomally as part of a larger endogenous plasmid (designated pME) of P. chrysosporium. Using the total DNA of p12-6 fungal transformants, p12-6, as well as a larger plasmid, p511, were recovered in recA- E. coli strains while only p12-6 was recovered in recA+ E. coli strains. The results also showed that the cytosine methylation system has no apparent effect on the strain-dependent recovery of p12-6 and p511 in E. coli from the total DNA of fungal transformants.
