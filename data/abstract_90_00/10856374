The ACC deaminase gene (acdS) from Enterobacter cloacae UW4 was replaced by homologous recombination with the acdS gene with a tetracycline resistance gene inserted within the coding region. Upon characterization of this AcdS minus mutant, it was determined that both ACC deaminase activity and the ability to promote the elongation of canola roots under gnotobiotic conditions were greatly diminished. This result is consistent with a previously postulated model that suggests that a major mechanism utilized by plant growth-promoting bacteria involves the lowering of plant ethylene levels, and hence ethylene inhibition of root elongation, by bacterial ACC deaminase.
