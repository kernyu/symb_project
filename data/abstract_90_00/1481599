A total of 221 patients with nonspecific inflammatory processes were studied with a view to determine the occurrence and species composition of microorganisms of the genus Corynebacterium on the mucous membrane and in the secretions of their genitals. Different representatives of this genus were detected in 23.1 +/- 3.5% of patients with cervicitis and endometritis and in 48.7 +/- 5.7% of patients with prostatitis. Among the isolated bacteria of this genus C. pseudogenitalium, C. genitalium and C. xerosis, as well as Corynebacterium cells of group JK, occurred most frequently. The strains under study were found to have high antibiotic resistance. On the basis of their cultural features, growth rate, the degree of contamination of the genitals and sensitivity to antibiotics, bacteria of this genus were differentiated into macro- and microcoryneforms.
