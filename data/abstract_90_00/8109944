The in vitro susceptibilities of 93 clinical isolates of Gardnerella vaginalis to 25 antimicrobial agents were determined by the agar dilution method. All isolates were susceptible to penicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim. Activity was poor for vancomycin, LY146032, the cephalosporins, ciprofloxacin, and imipenem. Some resistance was observed with tetracycline and minocycline. The MICs of metronidazole paralleled those of tinidazole, with the hydroxymetabolite of metronidazole being the most active. One strain was resistant to all three agents. Marked resistance to aztreonam, amikacin, and sulfamethoxazole was observed.
