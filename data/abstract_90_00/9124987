The results of a multicentre investigation of antibiotic susceptibility in 800 clinical isolates were analyzed. The levels of susceptibility to cefpirome and other antibiotics in gram-negative organisms with inducable production of chromosomal beta-lactamases (Enterobacter, Serratia, Citrobacter and others) were compared and the advantages of cefpirome over other cephalosporins were shown: 89 per cent of the susceptible strains against 58 to 78 per cent. With respect to other microorganisms the advantages of cefpirome were less pronounced.
