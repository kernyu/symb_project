The current status of antiretroviral therapy is in a state of flux. Clinical and immunologic benefit of antiretroviral treatment has been demonstrated, but the duration of benefit is finite and the effect on survival uncertain. Failure of antiretroviral treatment is closely associated with development of drug resistance. Strategies that may improve treatment outcome include combining or cycling antiretroviral agents. Given the current uncertainties in antiretroviral therapy, patients should be actively involved in treatment decisions.
