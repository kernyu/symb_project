A hundred and ninety-six textile samples were tested in a modified version of the Salmonella/microsome assay for release of mutagenic contaminants. As heat sterilization of the samples can result in reduction of mutagenic activity, tests were performed with streptomycin resistant derivatives of Salmonella tester strains TA98 and TA100. Textile samples were preincubated in buffered saline (PBS), DMSO or ethanol. Subsequently, the fabrics were placed on streptomycin supplemented selective agar plates. In total, 18 samples (9.2%) exerted mutagenic activity. DMSO was the most effective solvent (15 positives) followed by ethanol (9 positive samples) and PBS (7 positives). Most fabrics (16) caused mutagenic effects only upon metabolic activation with liver S9 mix. Chemical analysis indicates that the positive results obtained with PBS are not due to release of histidine or formaldehyde. Three directly active samples gave negative results in strain TA98NR which is devoid of classical nitroreductase. With one exception all other textiles were negative in strain TA98/1,8-DNP6 (which lacks O-acetyltransferase). These findings indicate that nitroaromatics and amines might be responsible for the mutagenic effects of the textiles.
