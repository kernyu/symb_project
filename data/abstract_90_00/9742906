In patients with otitis media or sinusitis, antibiotics must be used judiciously. First-line treatment for both uncomplicated acute otitis media and acute sinusitis is amoxicillin. Erythromycin ethylsuccinate and sulfisoxazole or TMP-SMZ may be used in patients who are allergic to penicillin. Beta-lactamase-stable agents should be given when no response occurs within 48 to 72 hours. In cases in which penicillin-resistant pneumococcus is suspected, high-dose amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, or clindamycin should be considered. Antibiotics are not indicated for initial treatment of otitis media with effusion but may be considered for effusions lasting longer than 3 months. Prophylactic antibiotics should be considered only for recurrent acute infections occurring three or more times within 6 months or four or more times within a year. The common cold should not be treated with antibiotics, and antimicrobial therapy should be initiated only when there is reasonable clinical certainty about the presence of acute sinusitis.
