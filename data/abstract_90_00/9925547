Mutants of wild-type Streptococcus pneumoniae IID553 with mutations in parC were obtained by selection with trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. All of the parC mutants were cross-resistant to the selecting agents but were not resistant to gatifloxacin and sparfloxacin. On the other hand, gyrA mutants were isolated by selection with gatifloxacin and sparfloxacin. The gyrA mutants were cross-resistant to gatifloxacin and sparfloxacin but were not resistant to the other fluoroquinolones tested. These results suggest that in wild-type S. pneumoniae the primary target of trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin is topoisomerase IV, whereas the primary target of gatifloxacin and sparfloxacin is DNA gyrase.
