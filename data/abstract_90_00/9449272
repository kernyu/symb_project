The trailing growth phenomenon seen when determining the susceptibilities of Candida isolates to the azole antifungal agents makes consistent endpoint determination difficult, and the M27-A method of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards addresses this problem by requiring an 80% reduction in growth after 48 h of incubation. For some isolates, however, minor variations of this endpoint criterion can produce up to 128-fold variations in the resulting MIC. To investigate the significance of this effect, isolates of Candida that exhibited various forms of trailing growth when tested against fluconazole were identified. The isolates were examined in a murine model of invasive candidiasis and were ranked by their relative response to fluconazole by using both improvement in survival and reduction in fungal burden in the kidney. The resulting rank order of in vivo response did not match the MICs obtained by using the M27-A criterion, and these MICs significantly overestimated the resistance of three of the six isolates tested. However, if the MIC was determined after 24 h of incubation and the endpoint required a less restrictive 50% reduction in growth, MICs which better matched the in vivo response pattern could be obtained. Minor variations in the M27-A endpoint criterion are thus required to optimize the in vitro-in vivo correlation for isolates that demonstrate significant trailing growth when tested against fluconazole.
