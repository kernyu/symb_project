A human colon-carcinoma cell subline resistant to doxorubicin (LoVo/Dx), previously shown to be more lysed than the chemosensitive subline LoVo/H by different immune effectors, is reported here to be similarly susceptible to direct, anti-proliferative effect of soluble cytokines (TNF-alpha and/or IFN-gamma). More adhesion molecules ICAM-1, LFA-3 and NCA were expressed on LoVo/Dx than on LoVo/H, while no significant amounts of CEA were detectable on the cell surface or in culture supernatant of either tumor subline. Anti-ICAM-1, anti-LFA-3 and anti-NCA monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) caused a marked reduction of lysis by interleukin-2 (IL-2) activated lymphocytes (LAK) of LoVo/Dx, whereas a lower effect was evident on LoVo/H. A pool of these antibodies was able to further increase the inhibition of the LAK lysis of both sublines. LoVo/Dx displayed a less differentiated phenotype as assessed by morphology, in vitro growth and altered or increased expression of markers such as desmoplakin and vimentin respectively, and disappearance of mucin. Treatment of LoVo sublines with differentiating agents (dimethylformamide and retinoic acid) led to a decreased expression of all adhesion molecules studied, accompanied by increased resistance to LAK-mediated lysis. These data indicate that sensitivity of chemoresistant tumor cells to cytotoxic effectors depends on the level of expression of adhesion molecules, including NCA, and is related to differentiation stage.
