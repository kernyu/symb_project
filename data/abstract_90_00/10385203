Inbred rabbits of the B/Jas strain are highly susceptible to herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) encephalitis, developing seizures of encephalitis after intravenous injection of the KOS strain of the virus. Anti-viral interferon activity became detectable in the serum just prior to or at the onset of seizures, its level being lower in the serum than in the cerebrospinal fluid. The activity was of gamma interferon, as suggested by the acid instability and the inability of Mx protein induction. An immunohistochemical analysis of the brain tissues of encephalitic rabbits showed that MHC class I antigen was expressed on the microglia cells of inflamed lesions but not on these cells in uninflamed areas. These findings were discussed in correlation with the pathogenesis of herpetic encephalitis in the inbred rabbits.
