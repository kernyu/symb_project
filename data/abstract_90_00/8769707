Mobilization of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) negative peripheral blood stem cells has been reported subsequent to intensive chemotherapy. We asked whether peripheral blood stem cells can be harvested subsequent to a less toxic chemotherapy regimen. Patients were treated with idarubicin 12 mg/m2 on day 1 and 2 and ara-C 100 mg/m2 days 1-5 and 5 or 10 micrograms/m2 G-CSF. In case of insufficient yield chemotherapy was repeated using IL-3 and G-CSF for mobilization of stem cells. Fourteen patients received 18 cycles of chemotherapy. The majority of patients were in late chronic phase and treated after secondary (interferon-alpha) IFN-alpha resistance. sufficient numbers of peripheral blood stem cells were harvested in 11 out of 14 patients. Although mixed Ph positive/Ph negative leukaphereses were harvested in the majority of patients, in no case were sufficient numbers of purely Ph negative progenitor cells for transplantation obtained. No toxic deaths were observed during the aplasia and the toxicity was acceptable. These preliminary results demonstrate that this procedure can be safely applied in patients with chronic phase CML and allows the harvesting of sufficient numbers of peripheral blood stem cells. The efficacy of this regimen for the mobilization of Ph negative cells should be further explored in patients at an earlier stage of the disease.
