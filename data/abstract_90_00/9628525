Previously, we have shown differences in susceptibility to the cecal carrier state in chicks orally infected with Salmonella enteritidis (SE) at 1 wk of age for four outbred lines: L2, B13, PA12, and Y11. The egg-type line L2 was one of the most susceptible lines and presented a large variability in cecal SE colonization. The heritability (h2) of the resistance to SE colonization in ceca was estimated in L2 chickens to determine whether genetic factors might be involved in its control. In three independent trials, a total of 819 L2 chicks produced from 88 sires and 232 dams were challenged orally with SE at 1 wk of age. Each week after inoculation, the frequency of cecal colonization was estimated. When this value had fallen to 50%, all the remaining animals were killed. The extent of cecal colonization by SE was estimated directly by counting the viable organisms in organs and determining the numbers of positive ceca. Enrichment culture was used in Trials 2 and 3. The effects of trial, of room within trial, and of cage within room on the frequency of SE contaminated ceca were often significant. No significant effect of sex was observed. Estimation of h2 using the frequency of SE positive ceca was low, 0.06 +/- 0.07, when results of direct culture were considered. In contrast, when considering the frequency obtained after enrichment, the h2 was estimated at 0.20 +/- 0.12. This result suggests a genetic basis for the expression of the resistance to colonization. An experiment of selection for resistance to SE carrier state in the chicken ceca should definitively confirm the genetic origin of the resistance.
