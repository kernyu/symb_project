Within the context of the monitoring of malaria drug resistance in the countries of the OCCGE, a workshop has been organized in order to sum up the surveys carried out by the national teams. For active or passive monitoring mainly the in vivo tests have been used. The native population, mainly school children, was studied. Chloroquine resistance was detected in 1987 in Benin, and in the same year in Togo and Cote d'Ivoire. During 1988 it appeared in Senegal and Burkina Faso, in 1989 in Niger and in 1990 in Mali. Only Mauritania is as yet free of resistance. The main features of this resistance are described. It is above all parasitological and on average its rate is less than 30%.
