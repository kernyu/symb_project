Gerbils with well developed peritoneal cysts of Echinococcus granulosus were randomized to albendazole 50 mg/kg/day or untreated control. Treated animals had less disease at post mortem after 3 months of treatment. Cysts were then taken from both albendazole-treated and control animals and cultured in vitro either with or without albendazole sulphoxide (Alb Sx) 500 micrograms/L for 14 days. Viability of cysts was then established by implantation of whole cysts into gerbils. Whilst naive cysts were affected by Alb Sx (only 2 cysts developed/gerbil) cysts from animals treated with albendazole were not sensitive to further therapy (6.4 cysts/gerbil).
