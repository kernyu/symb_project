Polysaccharides (EP) isolated from large scale plant cell cultures of Echinacea purpurea, have been shown to activate human and murine phagocytes. In this study we investigated the influence of EP on the nonspecific immunity in immunodeficient mice. EP was effective in activating peritoneal macrophages isolated from animals after administration of cyclophosphamide (CP) or cyclosporin A (CsA). EP-treated macrophages exhibited increased production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) and enhanced cytotoxicity against tumor target WEHI 164 as well as against the intracellular parasite Leishmania enrietti. After a CP-mediated reduction of leukocytes in the peripheral blood, the polysaccharides induced an earlier influx of neutrophil granulocytes as compared to PBS-treated controls. EP treatment of mice, immunosuppressed with CP or CsA, restored their resistance against lethal infections with the predominantly macrophage-dependent pathogen Listeria monocytogenes and predominantly granulocyte-dependent Candida albicans. Further, the effects of EP in allogeneic bone marrow chimeric mice are discussed. These findings may have therapeutical implications in prophylactic treatment of opportunistic infections.
