Susceptibilities of Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia spp. isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 hospitals during June 1993 to May 1994 to various antimicrobial agents were compared with those in the same period of previous years according to a classification, uncomplicated UTIs, complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter, and complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter. The susceptibilities of E. faecalis to chloramphenicol decreased. As for S. aureus, susceptible strains to minocycline (MINO) decreased in complicated UTIs. As for Citrobacter spp., and Enterobacter spp., their susceptibilities were not observed an obvious change. Against E. coli, the activities of cefotiam decreased in complicated UTIs, and aminoglycosides decreased. As for Klebsiella spp., susceptible strains to aminoglycosides decreased. The susceptibilities of P. mirabilis to all drugs except aminoglycosides and MINO were good. The susceptibilities of P. aeruginosa to quinolones isolated from complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter increased, but susceptible strains to aminoglycosides decreased. The susceptibilities of Serratia spp. to MINO has decreased. These data should be considered in clinical treatment of various urinary tract infections.
