Two distinct strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolated from patients in a dermatology ward were also resistant to mupirocin. The mupirocin resistance plasmids from both strains were indistinguishable by EcoRI and HindIII restriction digest analysis, except for the presence of genes apparently mediating penicillinase production in some transconjugants. Conjugative transfer of the plasmid mediating mupirocin resistance from one of these strains to a recipient S. aureus was accompanied in some cases by co-transfer of plasmids mediating resistance to tetracycline or erythromycin; in some instances a plasmid which possessed no apparent resistance markers was also transferred. The second strain demonstrated conjugative transfer of penicillin and mupirocin resistance as well as transfer of a plasmid mediating gentamicin resistance, but transfer of erythromycin resistance was not apparently plasmid-mediated.
