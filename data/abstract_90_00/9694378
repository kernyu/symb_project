An indispensable step of any comparative study is testing the concordance between the distribution of phenetic traits and the evolutionary history of the taxa under study. Here we present a computer program TREEPT which can perform these tasks on the basis of a permutation test. The use of the program was demonstrated on trichomonad drug sensitivity data. The program can also perform permutation tests analogous to the t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and correlation analysis and is available at http://www.natur.cuni.cz/flegr/PROGRAMS/+ ++TREEPT.ZIP and http://www.karlin. mff.cuni.cz/-zaboj/treept.
