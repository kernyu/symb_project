Selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD) appears to reduce infection, particularly pneumonia, in intensive care, and some patients benefit markedly. Gram-positive overgrowth and antibiotic resistance in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms has been recorded. However, the clinical and epidemiological significance of these observations is still debated. Future studies will need to be of sufficient size and duration to provide good quality data on which the safety and efficacy of SDD can be properly judged.
