BACKGROUND: A protocol was conducted to evaluate the compliance and results of Helicobacter pylori infection treatment in patients with ulcer disease. To know the metronidazole, clarithromycin and amoxicillin activities of Helicobacter pylori strains from such patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 35 patients with ulcer disease (27 duodenal ulcer and 8 gastric ulcer) were studied. Diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection was performed by urease test and culture of mucosal gastric samples from patients undergoing endoscopy. The patients received the following treatment during 7 days: omeprazole (20 mg bid), clarithromycin (500 mg bid) and amoxicillin (1 g bid), OCA x 7. Susceptibility was determined by E-test system on Wilkins-Chalgren blood agar and read after 5 days. RESULTS: 22/24 patients who had completed the protocol design eradicated Helicobacter pylori (91.7%), 11 patients (31.4%) refused second endoscopy to verify control of eradication. After treatment 10 patients presented with pyrosis "de novo" (28%). The overall metronidazol, claritromycin and amoxicillin resistance rate was 50%, 1.5% and 0% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: OCA x 7 treatment obtains a eradication rate higher than 90% in our patients with ulcer disease, despite smoking habit, but with a significative number of patients presenting pyrosis after treatment. We recommend a non-endoscopy method to verify eradication rate, because of its poor acceptance. 3. Metronidazol resistance rate is high in our series but clarithromycin susceptibility is maintained.
