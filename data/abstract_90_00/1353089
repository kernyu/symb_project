The effectiveness of triclosan 1% w/v against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and its effect on skin were compared with chlorhexidine gluconate 4% w/v ('Hibiclens') in a 7-week trial. Clinical information of MRSA rates obtained during the previous 10 months and results from earlier user acceptability trials were included. The average number of new cases of MRSA per week was reduced from 3.4 to 0.14 (P less than 0.0001) in the experimental ward whilst no significant changes occurred in the control ward. Staff reported less skin damage and a higher rate of acceptance with the experimental product. Based on results of the trial, a proposal to introduce triclosan for a 12-month study period has been accepted.
