PURPOSE: We studied a case of postoperative coagulase-negative Staphylococcus endophthalmitis in a 79-year-old man who had undergone cataract extraction in which vancomycin had been used intraoperatively in the infusion fluid. METHODS: The medical records were reviewed for the clinical history, ocular findings, and the vitreous and anterior chamber culture results. RESULTS: Acute, postoperative coagulase-negative Staphylococcus endophthalmitis developed in the patient in whom vancomycin had been used intraoperatively in the infusion fluid. CONCLUSIONS: Restraint is urged in the prophylactic use of vancomycin in the infusion fluids.
