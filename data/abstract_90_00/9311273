We report on two children with malignancy who showed fungemia despite the antifungal treatment with fluconazole. Case 1 was a 7-year-old girl with a recurrence of stage IV neuroblastoma. She had profound neutropenia and fungemia developed after a month-long treatment with fluconazole. Her peripheral blood smear showed phagocytosis in the neutrophils and they were identified as fungi by immunofluorescence method (Fungi flora Y). She died two days after the diagnosis of fungemia. Rhodotorula rubra was isolated after her death. Case 2 was a 2-year-old boy with disseminated Langerhans cell histiocytosis. He had profound neuropenia and fungemia developed after treatment with fluconazole for 6 months. His peripheral blood smear also showed phagocytosis in the neutrophils and they were identified as fungi by Fungi flora Y. He was treated with intravenously administered amphotericin-B. However, he died 13 days after the diagnosis of fungemia. Candida guilliermondii was isolated after his death. Careful observation of the peripheral blood smear is important for early detection of fungi and Fungi flora Y is a quick and useful method to identify fungi. Fluconazole-resistant fungus should be considered when patients with neutorpenia are treated prophylactically with fluconazole for a long time.
