Resistance to amikacin among members of the family Enterobacteriaceae at a hospital in Venezuela rose from 2% in 1979 to 5% in 1984 and 10% in 1985 as amikacin usage rose 20-fold to exceed gentamicin usage. Resistance to gentamicin remained at 25 to 27%. We examined the plasmids from 21 isolates obtained in 1984 and 1985. Nine of eleven in 1984 and three of ten in 1985 carried aacA and sul on a 3.8-kb BamHI fragment of pBWH300, a 10.4-kb nonconjugative plasmid that had been mobilized into strains of six species by at least two different coresident conjugative plasmids. Six 1985 isolates of two species carried these genes on a similar BamHI fragment of the 104-kb conjugative plasmid pBWH303. One isolate in 1984 and one in 1985 carried the 69-kb conjugative plasmid pBWH301, which had aacA as the promoter-proximal gene of an operon that also encompassed the cat and aadB resistance genes. Another conjugative plasmid, pBWH302, was found in a single isolate. It carried a different aacA allele on the functional transposon Tn654, which appeared to be closely related to Tn1331, a transposon previously isolated in Argentina and Chile. Increased selection may thus have led to dissemination of an endemic aacA allele on two endemic plasmids, one spread by mobilization, with occasional intrusion of additional aacA alleles from outside.
