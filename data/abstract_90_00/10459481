Sitafloxacin (DU-6859a) and trovafloxacin are novel quinolones potent on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) that are designed for once daily administration. In order to define the adequacy of the above regimen for the therapy of infections by multiple drug-resistant MRSA, their postantibiotic effect (PAE), their bactericidal activity, and their interactions with rifampin were determined on 14 MRSA isolates resistant to both ciprofloxacin and rifampin. PAE was defined after 1-h exposure to 1x, 4x, and 10x MIC and the killing effect after exposure to 1x and 4x MIC. Rifampin was applied for interactive studies at a concentration of 2 micrograms/mL, which is equal to its mean serum level. Median PAEs produced by 1x, 4x, and 10x MIC of sitafloxacin were 1.39, 3.75, and 6.61 h respectively, and by 1x, 4x, and 10x MIC of trovafloxacin 0.87, 2.07, and 2.23 h respectively. PAEs achieved by sitafloxacin were statistically shown to be longer than those achieved by trovafloxacin; PAEs achieved by a concentration of 10x MIC of each quinolone did not differ significantly from those achieved by a concentration of 4x MIC. Both the 4x and 10x MIC concentrations produced a more prolonged PAE than the 1x MIC concentration. A rapid bactericidal activity was expressed over the first 6 h of growth by each quinolone involving 80% of isolates enhanced in some isolates by their interaction with rifampin. The above findings revealed an extended PAE and a rapid killing effect of both sitafloxacin and trovafloxacin on MRSA resistant to ciprofloxacin and to rifampin, thus supporting their once daily administration in the therapy of infections by multiple drug-resistant MRSA. However little in vitro benefit is derived by their interaction with rifampin.
