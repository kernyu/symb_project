Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) deletion mutants of Brucella abortus S2308, a virulent strain, and S19, a vaccine strain, were generated by gene replacement. A deletion plasmid, pBA delta sodknr, was constructed by excising the Cu-Zn SOD gene (Cu-Zn sod) from a 2.3-kb B. abortus DNA fragment of plasmid pBA20-1527 and inserting a 1.4-kb DNA fragment encoding kanamycin resistance into the Cu-Zn sod excision site. The deletion plasmid was introduced into B. abortus by electroporation, and Southern blot analysis confirmed that the antibiotic resistance fragment had replaced Cu-Zn sod in kanamycin-resistant colonies. The survival and growth of Cu-Zn SOD mutant strains were compared with that of the parental strains in HeLa cells and in the mouse macrophagelike cell line J774. The survival and growth of the Cu-Zn SOD mutant strains were similar to those of their respective parental strains in HeLa and J774 cell lines. The kinetics of infection with these strains were examined in BALB/c mice. The splenic levels of the S19 Cu-Zn SOD mutant recovered from intraperitoneally infected BALB/c mice were approximately 10-fold lower than those of the parental strain through 26 days postinfection. Thereafter, infection sharply declined in both groups, and by 105 days postinfection, no organisms were detected. The splenic levels of the S2308 Cu-Zn SOD mutant were lower than those of wild-type S2308-infected mice. The spleen weights of mice infected with the S2308 Cu-Zn SOD mutant were consistently lower than those of wild-type S2308-infected mice. These results suggest that the antioxidant enzyme Cu-Zn SOD plays a role in the survival and pathogenicity of B. abortus in vivo.
