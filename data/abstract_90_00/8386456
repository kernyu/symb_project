Amylin and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) inhibited insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake in L6 myocytes and isolated soleus muscle. Both peptides were maximally active at 10 pM in L6 cells and inhibited insulin action by 40-50%. In soleus muscle amylin and CGRP inhibited insulin-stimulated uptake by 65-85%. Amylin competed with 125I-CGRP for binding to L6 cells but with 100-fold lower potency than CGRP. Occupancy of the CGRP receptor in L6 cells is coupled to adenylyl cyclase. Amylin increased the cellular content of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP), but consistent with binding, amylin was 100-fold less potent than CGRP. In soleus muscle, 100 nM amylin, which maximally inhibited 2-deoxyglucose uptake, had no effect cAMP content, whereas CGRP at the same concentration increased cAMP by 50%. The effect of CGRP on cAMP levels was completely suppressed by the competitive antagonist, CGRP-(8-37). In contrast, the suppression of insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis or 2-deoxyglucose uptake by amylin was unaffected by 1 microM CGRP-(8-37). Our results demonstrate that the inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport by amylin is independent of cAMP and may be mediated by a unique receptor that is distinct from the adenylyl cyclase-coupled CGRP receptor.
