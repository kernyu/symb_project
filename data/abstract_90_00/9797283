Contaminated soils from an oil refinery were screened for the presence of microorganisms capable of accumulating either nickel, vanadium, or both metals. Three strains of bacteria that belonged to the family Enterobacteriaceae were selected. Two of them were Escherichia hermannii strains, and outer membrane profile (OMP) analysis showed that they were similar to a strain of clinical origin; the other one was an Enterobacter cloacae strain that differed from clinical isolates. The selected bacteria accumulated both nickel and vanadium. Growth in the presence of vanadium induced multidrug resistance phenotypes in E. hermannii and E. cloacae. Incubation with this metal changed the OMP profile of E. hermannii but did not produce variations in the expression of the major OMPs of E. cloacae.
