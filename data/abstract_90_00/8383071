We have constructed several plasmid vectors with which a more efficient molecular cloning, followed by rescue, replication, and packaging of DNA fragments, can be achieved. The availability of these vectors should facilitate construction of a variety of recombinant adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV)-based virions containing therapeutic genes for potential use in human gene therapy.
