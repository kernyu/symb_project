Studies with fosfomycin tromethamine disks containing 200 micrograms of fosfomycin and 50 micrograms of glucose-6-phosphate confirmed the following zone diameter criteria for the NCCLS method: < or = 12 mm for resistant (MIC > or = 256 micrograms/ml), 13-15 mm for intermediate (MIC 128 micrograms/ml) and > or = 16 mm for susceptible (MIC < or = 64 micrograms/ml). Additional studies defined acceptable MIC and zone diameter ranges for the following quality control strains: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, MIC 0.5 to 4.0 micrograms/ml, zone diameter 23 to 29 mm; Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, zone diameter 26 to 32 mm; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27813, MIC 2.0 to 8.0 micrograms/ml; and Enterococcus faecalis, ATCC 29212, MIC 16 to 64 micrograms/ml.
