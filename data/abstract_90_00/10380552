We treated in our unit 25 patients (15M--10F) affected by pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) with rifabutin (RBT). Chronic liver disease, multidrug-resistant TB and HIV infection were featuring the clinical history of our selected patients. The treatment was carried out using a 150 mg/day dose of RBT, or 300 mg/day in case of MDR (multiple-drug-resistance)-TB or chronic TB. Rifabutin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and a fourth anti-mycobacterium drug were used when treating MDR-TB. Chest X-ray, haematological and bacteriological tests were performed on a monthly basis during the patients' follow up. No side effects were observed; only in two cases, both females, leukopenia occurred, but was not such a reason to modify our treatment plan. As a matter of fact, RBT is well tolerated by patients and it is particularly effective in bacterial eradication. In our experience, RBT did not provide the expected results only in one patient, affected by chronic TB.
