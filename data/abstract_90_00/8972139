A streptomycete strain D1.5 capable of producing broad spectrum antiobiotic was isolated from soil. The morphological, cultural, physiological and biochemical characters were studied, compared to known species and identified as Streptmoyces hygroscopicus. Antibiotic activity of the strain was tested against both Gram positive and negative bacteria as well as fungi. It exhibited complete resistance to beta-lactum antibiotics.
