Coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CNS) isolated from 86 different bovine intramammary infections (IMI) were investigated for their plasmid content, antimicrobial resistance, and infection characteristics. Plasmids were isolated from 30.2% of CNS. Number of plasmid bands ranged from 1 to 5. With the exception of tetracycline resistance, the presence of plasmids was not related to antibiotic resistance. Staphylococcus chromogenes was the CNS most frequently isolated from bovine IMI. Intramammary infections were of long duration (mean = 222 days) and resulted in a low incidence of clinical mastitis (8.1% of IMI). The greatest percentage of IMI (55%) were detected in heifers with 57% of these IMI first detected at calving. A total of 56% of IMI originated during the dry period in second lactation or older cows. The number of plasmid-positive CNS IMI was greater (P < 0.05) in multilactational cows when compared to heifers. The presence of a plasmid-positive CNS had no influence on duration of IMI, origin of IMI, clinical status of the infection, and elimination of IMI.
