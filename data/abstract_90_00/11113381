We have put emphasis on recent findings in experimental Trypanosoma congolense infections in highly susceptible BALB/c and relatively resistant C57Bl/6 mice. Based on various analyses, it has been shown that a major difference in resistance to T. congolense infections is expressed early in infection at the macrophage level. A novel plastic-adherent Thy1.2(+) suppressor lymphocyte, which in absolute synergy with a Thy 1.2(-) cell exerts its suppression via interleukin-10 and interferon-gamma opens up an exciting new field of research.
