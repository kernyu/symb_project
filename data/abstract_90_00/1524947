In the last five years fluoroquinolones have been extensively used in clinical practice and proved to represent a real step forward in antibiotic therapy. In this short overview, their mechanism of action (interaction with the bacterial DNA-gyrase and effect on bacterial membrane integrity) and pharmacological properties, with special emphasis on pharmacokinetics, distribution of the drug in the body at the level of the different target organs (urinary, gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, soft tissues, bone and sexual organs) are analyzed. The problem of the resistance to fluoroquinolones, which can develop more frequently during treatment of Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas infection, and the possibility of preventing bacterial resistance through concurrent therapy with other antimicrobial agents such as aminoglycosides are also discussed. Finally, the general antimicrobial spectrum as well as some unusual antibacterial effects, toxicity, pharmacological compatibilities and incompatibilities and clinical indications are reported.
