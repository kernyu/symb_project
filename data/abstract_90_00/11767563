This paper studied the variation of active oxygen content and membrane permeability in leaves of spring wheat seedling exposed to osmotic stress under normal 350 microliters.L-1 and doubled CO2 concentration 700 microliters.L-1. The results indicate that the increasing rate of O2.- and H2O2, and the membrane permeability in wheat leaves exposed to osmotic stress in normal CO2 concentration were higher than those in doubled CO2. Accordingly, it is suggested that doubled CO2 can reduce the membrane oxidative injury caused by osmotic stress, and increase plant drought resistance.
