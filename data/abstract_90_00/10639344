We studied the immunogenicity of a membrane fraction prepared from Candida albicans cells called C. albicans membrane antigen (CMA). The present study revealed that CMA immunization has antifungal activity in mouse models of systemic fungal infection. Immunization of mice by subcutaneous injections of CMA with incomplete Freund adjuvant induced resistance to infections caused not only by C. albicans but also by Aspergillus fumigatus. The level of resistance to candidiasis was as high as that induced by whole-cell immunization. The acquired resistance to candidiasis in the mice immunized with CMA was not diminished by immunosuppressive treatment with cyclophosphamide. The level of resistance to fungal infections was superior to that given by fluconazole (FLC) treatment alone and highly enhanced by the combination with FLC. When CD4(+) cells in CMA-immunized mice were depleted by a monoclonal antibody, the antifungal activity induced by the combination of CMA and FLC was significantly reduced. These results indicate that immunization with CMA is useful for preventing systemic fungal infections and in combination with FLC for increasing resistance after infection.
