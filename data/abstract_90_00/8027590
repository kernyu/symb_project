In humans with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, an interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) response by a specialized blood mononuclear cell to herpes simplex virus (HSV) in vitro is associated with resistance to opportunistic infections. A cell type of unknown lineage, designated the natural IFN-producing cell (NIPC), has been identified preliminarily as the source of these IFNs and may have a role in other host defense functions. Earlier studies suggested the existence of analogous HSV-responsive cell populations in mice. The role specifically of IFN-alpha in the murine system, however, has not been characterized. Using IFN bioassay and neutralization with antisera against Type I IFNs and IFN-beta, we have defined the types and sources of IFNs produced by mice in response to in vivo and in vitro challenge with UV-inactivated HSV. After intraperitoneal inoculation with HSV, BALB/c and C57Bl/6 strains produced characteristically different levels of serum IFNs that appeared principally to be IFN-alpha. The response of mononuclear cells from these mice differed from that of the intact mouse. Isolated cells from bone marrow and spleen released detectable IFNs much later than did whole animals, and the IFNs produced by marrow, spleen, and peritoneal cells were usually neutralized by the anti-IFN-beta. Only bone marrow cells produced detectable amounts of IFN-alpha. Both intact mice and their cells became refractory to restimulation with similar kinetics.
