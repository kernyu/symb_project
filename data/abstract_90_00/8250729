The distributions of tryptase-positive, chymase-negative mast cells (MCT) and tryptase-positive, chymase-positive mast cells (MCTC) were examined in allergic and non-allergic nasal mucosae. Sequential double immunohistochemical staining with anti-chymase and anti-tryptase antibodies was carried out. Additionally, metachromatic cells were examined in formalin or Carnoy-fixed tissues. The main types of mast cells in the epithelium were MCT and formalin-sensitive mast cells (FSMC) and those in the lamina propria were MCTC and formalin-resistant mast cells (FRMC) in both allergic and non-allergic nasal mucosae. The densities of MCT and FSMC in the nasal epithelium were observed to be significantly higher in the allergic group than in the non-allergic group. The distributions of MCT and FSMC, MCTC and FRMC tended to be similar in the nasal mucosa. The immunohistochemical method offered some advantages such as a higher sensitivity and the possibility to make observations in one section. Recently, human mast cells have been classified as either MCT or MCTC. It seems that information of the distribution of MCT and MCTC and of FSMC and FRMC is useful in studying the organ specificity and functional heterogeneity of mast cells in allergic tissues such as those found in nasal allergy.
