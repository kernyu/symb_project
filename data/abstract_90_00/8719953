First stage (L1) larvae of Haemonchus contortus, Trichostrongylus colubriformis and Ostertagia circumcincta can be cryopreserved in the presence of DMSO using a two-step freezing protocol involving an initial period at -80 degrees C prior to transfer to liquid nitrogen. Thawed L1 larvae continue development in vitro producing third stage (L3) larvae that are infective to sheep when dosed per os. Establishment rates for L3 larvae grown from thawed L1 larvae were 40 and 80% for H. contortus and T. colubriformis, respectively. There was no difference in survival or infectivity between benzimidazole (BZ)-susceptible and BZ-resistant H. contortus isolates and cryopreservation caused no shift in their BZ-resistance status as indicated in an in vitro larval development assay. Cryopreservation also had no effect on the sensitivity of these isolates to the avermectins or levamisole in vitro. High survival rates (60-70%), good levels of establishment and the stability of anthelmintic resistance status of isolates indicate that little if any selection occurs during the cryopreservation process. L1 larvae of all 3 species have been successfully recovered after 16 months storage in liquid nitrogen, cultured to the L3 stage and established in sheep.
