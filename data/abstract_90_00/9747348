Clindamycin is one of the antimicrobial agents most commonly used against anaerobes. Resistance to clindamycin in Bacteroides fragilis has been increasing recently. Thirty strains of clindamycin-resistant (including multi-resistant) B. fragilis were collected for study of cross-resistance to beta-lactam agents and beta-lactam--beta-lactamase inhibitor and resistance transferability. Imipenem was the most active drug against these 30 isolates. Resistance to clindamycin was transferred to a recipient in 12 out of 30 donor strains by using filter-mating. Of 12 transconjugants, only three had detectable plasmids by alkaline lysis method and the remaining nine strains lacked plasmids. The transfer frequencies ranged from 10(-4) to 10(-6). The role of plasmid in the resistance transfer was not certain. However, the results suggest that non-plasmid-mediated transfer accounted for the majority of the transfers of clindamycin-resistance of B. fragilis in this study. Tetracycline resistance was co-transferred from six donors. There was no evidence of co-transference of beta-lactam resistance under the selection marker of clindamycin, beta-lactam, or both. Therefore, non-plasmid-mediated transfer may play an important role in dissemination of resistance transfer in B. fragilis in Taiwan.
