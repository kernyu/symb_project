Two hundred and fourteen isolates of Salmonella typhi submitted to our laboratory between 1992 and 1996 were tested for susceptibility to 20 antimicrobial agents. Forty-eight of the 214 isolates (22.4%), recovered from individuals who had travelled in South Asia, were multiresistant. Forty-four of the 48 isolates were resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, cotrimoxazole, ticarcillin, and piperacillin; the other four isolates were resistant to four to six agents. Forty-two of the multiresistant isolates belonged to Vi phage type E1, two isolates from the Punjab State belonged to phage type A, another from the Punjab State belonged to phage type E3, one isolate from Pakistan belonged to type M1, and one isolate from India belonged to type J1. Plasmids from 45 of 48 isolates showed a temperature-sensitive mechanism of transfer to Escherichia coli K-12 strains, characteristic of H1 incompatibility group plasmids. The majority of plasmids had an estimated molecular weight of 120 MDa and encoded both citrate utilization and mercury resistance. Plasmids from three isolates had an estimated molecular weight of 112-115 MDa; one of these isolates encoded citrate utilization but not mercury resistance. Analysis of isolates by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis after digestion with XbaI and SpeI indicated that the majority of multiresistant isolates shared a common restriction profile, while four isolates had unique patterns.
