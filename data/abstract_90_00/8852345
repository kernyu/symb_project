Disc agar diffusion testing was performed on 547 isolates (two common pathogens) to determine if the site of isolation influenced the antimicrobial susceptibility results for a given bacterium. The most statistically significant results (P < 0.05) included cephalothin (ear) against Staphylococcus aureus and cephalothin (ear), lincomycin (ear), trimethoprim sulpha (ear), and amoxycilin and clavulanic acid (nose) against Staph. intermedius. Although the impact of these results (empirical treatment) is unknown, it is hypothesized that the site of isolation of Staph. aureus and Staph. intermedius may influence the choice of antimicrobial therapy in the dog and cat.
