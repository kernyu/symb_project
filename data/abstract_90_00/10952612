The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin versus those of 11 other antimicrobial agents against 400 strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae was determined by microdilution with supplemented GC agar. A total of 37.5% of the strains were beta-lactamase positive. A total of 70 and 6.4% of the beta-lactamase-negative strains exhibited intermediate and high-level penicillin resistance, respectively. Ceftriaxone and gemifloxacin were the most active drugs (MICs at which 90% of isolates are inhibited, 0.01 versus 0.007 microg/ml, respectively), with 100% of strains inhibited by 0.12 microg/ml.
