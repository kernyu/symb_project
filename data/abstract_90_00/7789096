The results of susceptibility testing of 48 phenotyped strains of glycopeptide antibiotic-resistant enterococci are reported. Minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations (MICs and MBCs) were determined for 27 vanA, 17 vanB, and 4 vanC strains. Antibiotics exhibiting the greatest activity included novobiocin (MIC90 = 8 micrograms/ml and MBC90 = 32 micrograms/ml), ramoplanin (MIC90 = 2 micrograms/ml and MBC90 = 4 micrograms/ml), and the streptogramin RP59500 (MIC90 = 4 micrograms/ml and MBC90 = 32 micrograms/ml). These antibiotics warrant further investigation as potentially useful agents, either alone or in combination, for treating enterococcal infections.
