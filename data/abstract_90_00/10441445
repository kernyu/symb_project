Fungal spoilage forms an increasing economic problem in the food industry. Chemical antifungals are becoming less attractive as food preservatives and hygiene agents due to the development of resistance and due to stricter legal regulations concerning the permitted concentrations. Finally, consumers tend to demand more "naturally preserved" or preservative-free products. Here we review our understanding of the mechanisms of action and resistance to classical antifungals. Next, we evaluate the scientific basis underlying the application of novel, natural antifungals. Finally, we discuss the mathematical modelling of fungal growth and the development of preliminary predictive lag-time models. The eventual aim of the reviewed work is to generate mathematical lag-time models in real foods that predict the microbiological stability of the food and are based on a mechanistic understanding of the chain of events that leads to cell death, or an extension of lag-time of the initiation of outgrowth.
