This review emphasises the advances in the development of newer quinolones: their broader antimicrobial activity particularly their increased activity against Pneumococcus and anaerobes; their longer half-life and tissue penetration including activity in cerebrospinal fluid; and their excellent efficacy in respiratory, intra-abdominal, pelvic, and skin and soft tissue infections. Also, considerable progress has been made in our understanding of the development of bacterial resistance to the newer quinolones. Additional advances in quinolone development are likely to provide better compounds for clinical use.
