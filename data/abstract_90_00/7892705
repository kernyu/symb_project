In an in vivo study of antimalarial sensitivity in Kabarole District, Western Uganda, 82% of asymptomatic malarial infections and 86% of symptomatic infections were chloroquine sensitive. Of persons with symptomatic malaria, 88% were sensitive to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (Fansidar). Amodiaquine cleared parasites in all persons in whom it was used. Over the course of the past five years, there appears to be no substantial increase in the extent of chloroquine resistance in Western Uganda.
