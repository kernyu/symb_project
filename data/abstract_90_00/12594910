Broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics have several advantages in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections. These agents are effective against gram-negative rods and anaerobes, reach therapeutic levels rapidly after parenteral administration, and, in the absence of penicillin allergy, generally exhibit low toxicity. The second-generation cephalosporins (e.g., cefoxitin, cefotetan) are used widely in surgical prophylaxis, trauma, and treatment of mild-to-moderate community-acquired infections, but limitations in their spectra and microbial resistance restrict their utility in more serious infections. Extended-spectrum penicillin/beta-lactamase-inhibitor combinations are effective in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections and include enterococci in their spectrum. Gram-negative aerobe resistance has developed to ampicillin/sulbactam. Piperacillin/tazobactam, a ureidopenicillin with increased gram-negative coverage and enhanced antipseudomonal activity, has proved to be effective in clinical trial therapy for intra-abdominal infections. The very broad spectrum carbapenems--imipenem/cilastatin and meropenem--are effective for serious infections or resistant organisms and are often used in the intensive care unit or for nosocomial intra-abdominal infection. These classes of beta-lactams comprise a range of antimicrobials that can be targeted effectively as single agents to both prevention and treatment of intra-abdominal infection.
