This article addresses the use of tetracycline-impregnated fibers in the treatment of periodontal diseases. Clinical and microbiologic data are reviewed to provide pragmatic guidelines for fiber use. In addition, controversial issues associated with the labeling of Actisite, the potential of developing antibiotic-resistant strains, and the benefits of systemic vs local drug delivery are discussed. Ultimately, the article concludes that tetracycline-impregnated fibers can be used as an adjunct to scaling and root planing in certain patients at sites that do not respond to conventional therapy.
