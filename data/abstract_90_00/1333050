The Y1 adrenocortical tumor cell mutants, Kin-7 and Kin-8, harbor point mutations in the regulatory subunit (RI) of the type 1 cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAMPdPK) that render the enzyme resistant to activation by cAMP. These mutants also are resistant to many of the regulatory effects of ACTH and cAMP. In order to examine the causal relationships between the mutations in cAMPdPK and the resistance to ACTH and cAMP, the Kin mutants were transfected with expression vectors encoding wild type subunits of cAMPdPK in order to restore cAMP-responsive protein kinase activity. The transformants then were screened for the concomitant recovery of cellular responsiveness to ACTH and cAMP. In the mutant Kin-7, cAMP-responsive protein kinase activity was recovered after transfection with an expression vector encoding wild type mouse RI. Protein kinase activity in the mutant Kin-8 remained largely cAMP-resistant after transfection with the RI expression vector but could be rendered cAMP-responsive by transfection with an expression vector encoding the wild type catalytic subunit. The recovery of cAMP-responsive protein kinase activity was accompanied by the recovery of steroidogenic and morphological responses to ACTH and cAMP, suggesting that the cAMP-dependent signaling cascade plays an obligatory role in these actions of ACTH. The growth-regulatory effects of cAMP were not reversed with the recovery of cAMP-responsive protein kinase activity, suggesting that cAMP-resistant growth regulation results from second-site, adaptive mutations either in the original Kin mutant population or in the transformants. Studies on the conversion of 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol into steroid products in parent and mutant cells indicate that the Kin mutations reduce the steroidogenic capacity of the cell as well as inhibit the hormone- and cyclic nucleotide-dependent mobilization of substrate cholesterol.
