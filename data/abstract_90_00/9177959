Resistance of Candida to azoles is an increasing problem. Susceptibility testing of Candida against fluconazole and ketoconazole is now feasible and desirable. Good correlation of resistance in vitro with clinical failure of fluconazole therapy has now been shown in mucosal candidiasis. The relationship, if any, between resistance and clinical failure in the context of invasive candidiasis is not clear at present and additional correlative work needs to be done. Monitoring of resistance trends in Candida is clearly important now.
