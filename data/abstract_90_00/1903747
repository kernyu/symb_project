A plasmid known to be associated with mupirocin resistance of Staphylococcus aureus has been isolated and a restriction enzyme map constructed. An EcoRI fragment of 4.05 kb from this plasmid has been cloned into an Escherichia coli-Staphylococcus aureus shuttle vector and shown to carry the gene for resistance to mupirocin. The DNA sequence of a small section of the gene has been determined and the derived amino acid sequence compared with a data bank. The amino acid sequence is identical for eight amino acids with the sequence of isoleucyl tRNA synthetase of E. coli. This finding adds to the evidence that mupirocin resistance is the result of a modified isoleucyl tRNA synthetase.
