The paper presents and discusses a novel on-line real-time non-destructive continuous-flow system for biocide testing on industrial biofilms. This laboratory system is capable of monitoring changes in growth, accumulation and respiratory activity of biofilms in response to biocidal treatment. The system incorporates a fouling monitor for continuous measuring of the rate of biofilm accumulation (heat transfer resistance), a sensor for monitoring of microbial activity (oxygen meter for monitoring the rate of biofilm respiratory activity), and subsystems necessary for microbial life support and control of operation parameters. Examples of system operation and testing of oxidizing and non-oxidizing biocides are presented.
