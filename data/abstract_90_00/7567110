The in vitro activity of two new beta-lactam agents, cefpirome (CPO) and cefepime (FEP), was investigated against 295 Gram-negative bacilli (250 enterobacteriaceae and 45 P. aeruginosa) isolated from neutropenic patients. They were compared with ceftazidime (CAZ), piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP), imipenem (IPM) and cefotaxime (CTX). All enterobacteriacae were susceptible to IPM, 16 strains were intermediately susceptible or resistant to CAZ (1 strain of E. coli, 4 of Morganella morganii and 11 of Enterobacter. The 250 strains of enterobacteriacea were susceptible to FEP (MIC < 1 mg/l) and only one strain among them was intermediately susceptible to CPO. Among 45 strains of P. aeruginosa, 21 strains were susceptible to CPO, 30 to FEP, 31 to TZP, 32 to CAZ and 34 to IPM. All the strains were inhibited by less than 32 mg/l of FEP and IPM.
