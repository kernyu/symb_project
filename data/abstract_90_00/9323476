Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of penicillin for Streptococcus pneumoniae were determined by the E-test and the agar dilution method. Ninety Streptococcus pneumoniae strains were tested, of which 16 were resistant, 33 intermediate, and 41 susceptible by agar dilution. By the E-test, 80 (88.9%) strains agreed with these determinations within one log2 dilution step, and no strains disagreed by more than two dilution steps. Sixty-eight of the 70 strains with discrepant MICs read lower in the E-test, resulting in 15 strains being placed in different susceptibility categories when classified by this test. Exact MICs rather than classification groups should be used to determine appropriate antibiotic therapy, since small differences in MICs determined by different methods can lead to a significant degree of misclassification.
