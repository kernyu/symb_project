On the basis of MIC determinations and appropriate MIC breakpoints, 370 pathogens showed complete cross resistance between cefpodoxime and cefuroxime axetil, cefotiam hexetil, cefixime and cefotaxime in 69.7%, 80.3%, 92.2% and 87% of the strains, respectively. Cefpodoxime was superior to cefuroxime axetil in 28.7%, to cefotiam hexetil in 17.6%, to cefixime in 7% of strains and to cefotaxime not at all. On the other hand, we found cefpodoxime to be inferior to the cephalosporins mentioned in 1.6%, 2.1%, 0.8% and 13%, respectively.
