Phospholipids extracted from liver microsomes and mitochondria of ethanol-fed rats retained the resistance to membrane disordered by ethanol which is observed in the intact isolated membranes. The lipid extracts were separated into the major phospholipid classes (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol from microsomes and phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and cardiolipin from mitochondria) by preparative TLC. The extent of membrane disordering by ethanol of phospholipid vesicles composed of a mixture of phospholipids from ethanol-fed rats and controls was determined from the reduction of the order parameter of the spin-probe 12-doxyl-stearate. In contrast to previous reports, we found that all phospholipid classes from ethanol-fed rats confer resistance to disordering by ethanol. To a first approximation the extent of resistance was proportional to the fraction of lipids from ethanol-fed rats, regardless of the phospholipid head-group. Subtle differences between phospholipid classes may exist but were too small to measure accurately. Except for phosphatidylethanol, incorporation of anionic phospholipids did not have a significant effect on the sensitivity of phospholipid vesicles to the disordering effect of ethanol. Vesicles prepared from mixtures of various dioleoyl phospholipids and natural phospholipids did not indicate a clear effect of fatty acid saturation on the sensitivity to disordering by ethanol. Although the precise molecular changes that occur in phospholipids from ethanol-fed rats have not been fully characterized it appears that subtle changes in all phospholipid classes contribute to the resistance to ethanol disordering of these membranes.
