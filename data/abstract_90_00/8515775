We have further analyzed parameters affecting stable transformation of Trypanosoma brucei. Linear DNA was much more efficient than circular DNA and in the vast majority of transformants analyzed the plasmid DNA had inserted into the chromosomes by homologous recombination. The presence of non-homologous (vector) DNA at one or both ends of linear constructs inhibited transformation efficiency. Less than 1 kb of homologous flanking sequence was sufficient for efficient targeting of a marker gene into the tubulin gene array. When transformants with a single neomycin phosphotransferase (neo(r)) gene replacing a beta-tubulin gene were selected for higher levels of G418 resistance, the neo(r) gene was amplified and spread through the tubulin gene cluster. The additional neo(r) gene copies were adjacent in the tubulin gene array and were added to the array rather than replacing beta-tubulin genes. These results are compatible with asymmetric post-replication recombination (unequal sister chromatid exchange) as the mechanism for neo(r) gene amplification. Starting with a circular construct containing the neo(r) gene between tubulin intergenic regions, we obtained a single transformant that maintained the neo(r) genes as an extrachromosomal plasmid. We show this plasmid to consist of a circular pentamer of the input construct. All other attempts to derive a shuttle vector that replicates extrachromosomally in T. brucei were unsuccessful. Our experiments extend previous observations suggesting that T. brucei has a strong preference for chromosomal insertion of exogenous DNA by homologous recombination.
