We investigated the interaction between amphotericin B and azithromycin in vitro against 26 clinical isolates of Fusarium. Synergy was demonstrated in all isolates. Amphotericin B MICs were reduced from a mean of 1 mg/L when tested alone to a mean of 0.37 mg/L when tested in combination with azithromycin. Azithromycin demonstrated no activity against Fusarium when tested alone (MIC > 128 mg/L). When combined with amphotericin B the mean MIC was reduced to 5.5 mg/L, a level readily achieved in tissue. Given the resistance of Fusarium to conventional therapy, the in-vitro synergy between amphotericin B and azithromycin might prove to be important in therapy for fusariosis.
