In the present work, we have studied the prediction of blood cyclosporine (CsA) concentrations in haematological patients with multidrug resistance by means of total body weight, 25, 50 and 75 adipose factor dosing body weight, and lean body weight using the Bayesian method (BM) and non-linear least squares method (NLLSM) during the second course of CsA treatment. The results showed that both BM and NLLSM can minimize the prediction difference among different dosing body weight parameter types. The results also slightly favour the predictions with lean body weight.
