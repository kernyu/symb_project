Resistance patterns against 24 antimicrobial agents were examined for 50 strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolated at Hiroshima University Hospital during the period October 1990 and July 1991. Overall resistance (the percentage of highly and moderately resistant strains) to the antimicrobial agents is summarized as follows: methicillin 100%, flomoxef 100% (beta-lactams); kanamycin 94%, tobramycin 94%, amikacin 100%, isepamicin 94%, gentamicin 80%, dibekacin 94%, arbekacin 2% (basic oligosaccharide group/aminocyclitols); ofloxacin 96%, temafloxacin 96%, levofloxacin 96% (fluoroquinolones); erythromycin 98%, clarithromycin 98%, josamycin 30% (macrolides); vancomycin 0% (glycopeptide); tetracycline 94%, minocycline 94% (tetracyclines); fosfomycin 100%; mikamycin B 30%, nosiheptide 0% (peptide); rifampicin 2% (ansamycin); streptomycin 2% (basic oligosaccharide group); chloramphenicol 2%. Arbekacin resistance was observed in one case: the cross resistance was complete among the aminocyclitol antibiotics tested in this study and streptomycin, probably due to the ribosomal alteration.
