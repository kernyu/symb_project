Several oxidative and non-oxidative stresses were applied to two transgenic strains of Drosophila melanogaster (designated P(bSOD)5 and P(bSOD)11) that express superoxide dismutase (SOD) at elevated levels, and control strains that express normal SOD levels. Transgenic strain P(bSOD)5 exposed to paraquat (1,1'-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridinium dichloride), a redox cycling agent that generates superoxide anion when metabolized in vivo, was significantly more resistant to this xenobiotic than control flies. When test flies were subjected to 100% oxygen for 20 min each day, the mean lifespan was 3.62 days for control strain 25, but 4.35 days for both transgenic strains. The mortality curves of strains fed 1% H2O2 were similar, but the median lifespan of 72 h for controls and 64 h for transgenics suggests that the transgenic flies were slightly more sensitive to H2O2. The activity of catalase was the same for all strains. Using starvation resistance as a non-oxidative stress, flies maintained on water without any food had identical survival curves; for all strains, the median lifespan was 72 h. Throughout the lifespan, no statistically significant difference in physical activity was displayed for transgenic versus control flies. Collectively, these data suggest that the increased lifespan previously observed in SOD transgenics is specifically related to resistance to oxidative stresses.
