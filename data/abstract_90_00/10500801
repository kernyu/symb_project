It has been suggested that one means by which chemotherapeutic agents exert their effect on leukaemic cells, is via autocrine induction of fas-ligand which then binds to fas (CD95), activates the caspase pathway and results ultimately in apoptotic death. In order to test this hypothesis, we have treated leukaemic cell lines with various chemotherapeutic agents (idarubicin, etoposide, fludarabine and 2-CdA) with and without pre-treatment with fas (ZB4) and fas-ligand (NOK-1) blocking monoclonal antibodies. Cell cycle analysis and quantitation of apoptosis were performed by flow cytometry following propidium iodide staining. HL-60 cells were found to be sensitive to the induction of apoptosis with all drugs tested but were highly resistant to treatment with a fas-ligating antibody (CH11). Apoptosis was neither inhibited in parental CEM cells nor their mdr-expressing drug resistant counterpart, CEM/VLB100 by pre-treatment with either ZB4 or NOK1. In addition, CEM/VLB100 were slightly more sensitive to treatment with CH11 (100 ng/ml) than parental CEM cells (% age apoptosis = 30.35 and 23.675, p = 0.024) and at least as sensitive to recombinant fas-ligand (50 ng/ml) (% age apoptosis = 26.6 and 20.2, p = NS). We conclude that it is unlikely that fas/fas-ligand interactions play a significant role in the induction of apoptosis by these chemotherapeutic agents in the leukaemic cell lines tested.
