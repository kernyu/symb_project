We studied 46 Staphylococcus aureus strains with three patterns of antimicrobial resistance (MARSA, MRSA and MSSA) obtained from inpatients of a large community hospital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The strains showed a single biochemical pattern. On the contrary, remarkable phage-typing differences could be observed. Thirteen strains were associated to phagic group III and the remainder could not be typed even though most of them had shown a weak sensitivity to phage 54. Fourteen strains synthesized one or more enterotoxins. Enterotoxin D was synthesized more often. Neither was EEB produced nor TSSF-1. The results suggested the widespreading of different staphylococci strains in that hospital. There was strong evidence that some cases of nosocomial infections leading to death have been caused by the same S. aureus strain recovered from some inpatients in the intensive care unit.
