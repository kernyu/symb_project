Reduced glutathione (GSH) levels and resistance to chlorine were measured for two isogenic Escherichia coli strains stressed by oxygenation and/or starvation. The E. coli mutant deficient in GSH was not more sensitive to the oxidant than its parent strain when the bacteria were cultured with a low oxygenation rate. Starvation or oxygenation increased the resistance of the parent strain to chlorine, while the resistance of the deficient strain remained unchanged.
