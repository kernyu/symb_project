Two distinct DNA sequences expressing novobiocin resistance in Streptomyces lividans were cloned from the novobiocin-producing species Streptomyces niveus. Clone pGL101 (5kb) conferred resistance to 50 micrograms ml-1 novobiocin, whereas clones pGL102 and pGL103, which carry the same 6.5kb insert but in opposite orientations, expressed resistance to 150 micrograms ml-1. The cloned inserts from pGL101 and pGL103 failed to hybridize with each other or with the cloned novobiocin-resistant gyrB sequence from Streptomyces sphaeroides. Both probes hybridized strongly with DNA from the novobiocin-producing species S. niveus and S. sphaeroides but no hybridization (pGL103) or very weak hybridization (pGL101) was detected with DNA from the non-producing species S. lividans, Streptomyces griseus and Streptomyces antibioticus. S. niveus contains at least three novobiocin-resistance determinants with the pGL101 and pGL103 cloned sequences specific for novobiocin-producing strains of Streptomyces.
