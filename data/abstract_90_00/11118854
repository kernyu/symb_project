The epidemiology of HIV-1 genomic mutations causing antiretroviral drug resistance, in 145 HIV-1 infected patients were obtained using a new sequencing technique. All patients were in a follow up treatment for at least 4 months with all drugs available in clinical practice in accordance to international guidelines. The percentage of the mutations were calculated both on the number of all participants and on the number of patients who received the drugs selecting for that specific resistance. It was possible then to evaluate patients who showed the mutation without receiving the drug. We consider this new sequencing method reliable and hopeful in clinical practice, giving the opportunity for a guided therapy for the single patient and in detecting and monitoring the antiretroviral drug resistance mutations in the pertinent geographic area following a periodic surveillance program.
