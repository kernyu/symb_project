The nonconjugative 4.4 kb plasmid pBS195 has been found in Lactobacillus sp. 195 strain resistant to kanamycin and streptomycin. The plasmid pBS195 determining the resistance to kanamycin has a broad host range. It is inherited by the Gram-positive microorganisms (Bacillus subtilis) as well as by Escherichia coli cells, has the cleavage sites for the restriction endonucleases BamHI, EcoRI, HindIII, PstI, KpnI. The restriction map of the plasmid for these enzymes is constructed. The broad host range, efficiently expressed marker, the presence of the unique restriction sites, small size make the plasmid pBS195 promising for the genetic engineering research.
