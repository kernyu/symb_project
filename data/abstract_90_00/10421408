Five AIDS patients with cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis who had received ganciclovir (GCV) therapy were followed with serial blood sampling to detectchanges both in CMV load and in the genetic composition of genes UL97 and UL54 whilst receiving cidofovir (CDV) therapy. CDV neither reduced CMV load in blood nor prevented its quantitative resurgence during therapy. These effects were not explained by the initial presence or development of CDV-associated drug resistance mutations in UL54. In two patients, UL97 genotypic resistance to GCV involving either a L595S mutation or a deletion of amino acids 590-603 were present at the initiation of CDV and, in both patients, repopulation of CMV strains with wild-type UL97 sequences occurred during CDV therapy. These data are consistent with GCV-resistant strains containing UL97 mutations being less fit than their wild-type counterparts and so being able to persist only with the selective pressure of GCV.
