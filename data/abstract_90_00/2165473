Large (greater than 50 kilobases) conjugal chromosomal tetracycline resistance (Tcr) elements have been found in many human colonic Bacteroides strains. Recently, N. B. Shoemaker and A. A. Salyers (J. Bacteriol, 170:1651-1657, 1988) reported that some of these Tcr elements appeared to mediate production of plasmidlike forms, NBU1 and NBU2, from an unlinked region of the chromosome of Bacteroides uniformis 0061. Production of the plasmidlike forms and the transfer frequency of the Tcr elements were both enhanced by preexposure to tetracycline. Thus it appeared that genes involved in production of plasmidlike forms (Plf activity) might be coregulated with transfer genes and that Plf activity might have a role in transfer of the Tcr elements. By screening subclones of a Tcr element, Tcr Emr DOT, we have shown that the genes necessary for Plf activity on the Tcr element are within a 10-kilobase region adjacent to the Tcr gene. Subclones of this region were then used to construct insertional gene disruptions in a Tcr element, Tcr ERL, which is closely related to the Tcr Emr DOT element. Two of the disruption mutants were Plf-. Both had reduced transfer frequencies, one (omega RDB2) 10(2)-fold lower than that of the wild-type element and the other (omega RDBT) 10(4)-fold lower. omega RDB2 was also deficient in the ability to mobilize coresident plasmids, whereas omega RDBT exhibited nearly wild-type mobilization activity. The phenotypes of the mutants indicate that there are at least two genes necessary for Plf activity and that both may be involved in transfer of the element. The third disruption mutant (omegaRDB1), which expressed Plf constitutively, also had a transfer frequency 10(2) -fold lower than that of the wild-type element and was deficient in mobilization of coresident plasmids. The relationship between Plf genes and transfer, therefore, appears to be a complex one.
