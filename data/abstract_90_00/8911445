The parasitological, clinical and haematological responses to chloroquine treatment were studied in children during a 28-day follow-up in an area of Cote d'Ivoire with intermediate chloroquine resistance. The parasitological, clinical and haematological responses to Fansidar were also investigated in patients who returned to the health centre within 28 days with symptoms of malaria. Of 82 children aged 0-9 years who completed the study, only 67% were parasite-negative on thick blood film on day 7, which decreased to 21% by day 28. While chloroquine treatment still produced clinical remission at day 7 in 95% of the children, 35% had recurrent fever with concomitant parasitaemia before day 28. All fever cases subsequently treated with Fansidar remained parasite-negative over a period of 28 days. On day 28 the haematocrit levels were higher in those children who responded successfully to treatment with either chloroquine or Fansidar than in the children who were still parasite-positive but without fever (two-tailed t-test, P = 0.02). The rate of resistance to chloroquine was most pronounced among the younger children (< 5 years), 18% of whom showed clinical failure by day 14. This study underlines the importance of monitoring the durability of response to chloroquine treatment for at least 14 days in young children in Cote d'Ivoire.
