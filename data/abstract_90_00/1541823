We have examined the abilities of the recombinant murine lymphokines IFN-gamma, granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF, and IL-4 to stimulate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of macrophages against the live vaccine strain (LVS) of Francisella tularensis. Resident peritoneal macrophages from C57BL/6 strain mice were cultured overnight with IFN-gamma, GM-CSF, or IL-4, and then infected with LVS. In macrophages treated with IFN-gamma, the growth of LVS was suppressed by a factor of 100- to 1000-fold in comparison with untreated cells. This effect was dose-dependent and was enhanced by the addition of LPS. In contrast, macrophages treated with either GM-CSF or IL-4 exhibited no such enhanced antitularemic activity, even in the presence of LPS. Because reactive nitrogen intermediates derived from L-arginine metabolism have been implicated in the killing of various infectious organisms, we evaluated the possibility that such a mechanism might contribute to the antitularemic activity of IFN-gamma-stimulated macrophages. Macrophages were treated with NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMMA), an inhibitor of L-arginine metabolism in mammalian cells, during the activation procedure and throughout the course of infection. NMMA had no effect on the growth of LVS in unstimulated macrophages. In macrophages activated with IFN-gamma, however, NMMA suppressed their capacity to inhibit LVS growth. This effect was proportional to the dose of NMMA added and reversible by supplementing the medium with additional L-arginine, and there was a direct correlation between the production of nitrite by activated macrophages and their ability to inhibit LVS growth. Furthermore, the growth of LVS was inhibited by nitrogen metabolites in a cellfree system. The results of this study indicate that the mechanism of action of IFN-gamma on the resistance of macrophages to LVS growth is related, at least in part, to the production of reactive nitrogen metabolites.
