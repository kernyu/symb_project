A system for surveillance of invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b infections in Denmark yielded 135 strains isolated from blood or cerebrospinal fluid from August 1988 through December 1989. The susceptibility of the strains to 7 antibiotics was investigated by an agar dilution method. Ceftriaxone was found to be the most active drug followed by cefotaxime, ceftazidime, rifampicin, ampicillin, cefuroxime, and chloramphenicol. Except for ampicillin the MICs for the individual antibiotics were similar. Seven strains (5.2%), which all produced beta-lactamase, were resistant to ampicillin. Since H. influenzae type b meningitis in otherwise healthy individuals almost exclusively occurs in children aged 2 months to 4 years, a third generation cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone or cefotaxime may be considered the drug of choice for initial therapy of meningitis in this age group.
