In a multicentre study, the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates in 19 large clinics in Germany were recorded, and the resistance characteristics of these strains were studied. Oxacillin-mannitol-salt agar plates were distributed to all participants to ensure uniformity of screening, and each laboratory used these plates to investigate 200 consecutive Staphylococcus aureus isolates for oxacillin-methicillin resistance. Of the 3,794 evaluable Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 71.5% were penicillin and 3.7% (142) oxacillin resistant; four study centres reported methicillin-oxacillin resistance rates of more than 5%. Of the MRSA isolates, 75% were also resistant to ciprofloxacin, 61% to fosfomycin, 52% to imipenem, 50% to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and 36% to clindamycin. All isolates were sensitive to vancomycin and teicoplanin. Of the Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from patients in intensive therapy units, 10.4% were methicillin-oxacillin resistant. Drains and catheter tips (9.8% and 5.2% respectively) were the materials with the highest proportions of MRSA. Of the MRSA isolates in this study, 58.2% belonged to lysis group II.
