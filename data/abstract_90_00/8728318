The glycosylation state of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) may be important in determining its enzymatic activity. We compared glycosylation structure, enzyme kinetics, and phosphatidylcholine (PC) acyl specificity of human LCAT from four sources: human plasma (pLCAT), media from HepG2 cells (HepG2 LCAT), media from SF21 cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus (bLCAT) and media from stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (CHO LCAT). bLCAT was underglycosylated (molecular weight approximately 50 kDa) and resistant to digestion by N-glycanase F, endoglycosidase F, and neuraminidase. CHO and HepG2 LCAT were overglycosylated (approximately 68 kDa and approximately 70-75 kDa) compared to pLCAT (approximately 65 kDa). CHO LCAT, like pLCAT, was sensitive to N-glycanase F and neuraminidase but not to endoglycosidase F. HepG2 LCAT demonstrated resistance to N-glycanase F and endoglycosidase F. Apparent Km values for all four enzymes were similar (1.4-9.2 microM cholesterol) for recombinant high density lipoproteins (rHDL) containing sn-1 16:0, sn-2 18:1 PC (POPC). Apparent Vmax values (nmol cholesteryl ester formed/h per micrograms) were 52.6 for pLCAT, 48.6 for CHO LCAT, 15.3 for bLCAT, and 8.3 for HepG2 LCAT. Changes in PC acyl specificity in the presence and absence of cholesterol were characterized by comparing the ratio of LCAT activity on rHDL containing sn-1 16:0, sn-2 20:4 PC (PAPC) or POPC (PAPC/POPC activity ratio). The ratios for pLCAT, bLCAT, CHO LCAT, and HepG2 LCAT activity were 0.63, 0.49, 0.56, and 0.51 with cholesterol and 0.34, 0.29, 0.36, and 0.99 without cholesterol, respectively. We conclude that LCAT source influences glycosylation structure, which affects the apparent Vmax for cholesteryl ester formation with only minor changes in apparent Km or acyl substrate specificity.
