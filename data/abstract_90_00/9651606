We investigated antimicrobial activity of clindamycin (CLDM) against clinically isolated Streptococcus pneumoniae in 1996. The results are summarized as follows; 1. The detection frequencies of macrolides (MLs)-resistance against penicillin (PC)-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PSSP) was 48.0% and those against PC-intermediate S. pneumoniae (PISP)/ PC-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) was 92.0%. 2. It was found that the ratio of MLs-inducible resistant strains of PSSP was 24.6% and that of PISP/PRSP was 66.0%. MLs-constitutive resistant strains of PSSP accounted for 24.0% and that of PISP/PRSP for 26.0%. MLs-constitutive resistant strains was relatively frequent in PSSP and MLs-inducible resistant strains was frequent in PISP/PRSP. 3. CLDM showed strong antimicrobial activity against MLs-inducible resistant strains. The MIC70 of CLDM against PSSP was < or = 0.025 microgram/ml and that against PISP/PRSP was 0.1 microgram/ml. From these results, it was suggested that CLDM is effective against the infection of PISP/PRSP where the detection frequency of MLs-inducible strains was high. 4. Antimicrobial activity of CLDM was found to be strong against MLs-inducible resistant strains, but to be weak against MLs-constitutive resistant strains. When S. pneumoniae is detected, susceptibility of the strain to CLDM should be examined.
