Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and other related enterotoxigenic species were isolated from 176 (44%) of 399 infants hospitalised in 'Caritas Baby Hospital' in Bethlehem, during April-December 1993. Ninety four of the patients infected by ETEC, were clinically evaluated. Most of them suffered from diarrhoea, quite often with fever and vomiting. Dehydration occurred in 58.3% of the patients and failure to thrive (FTT) in 28.5% of them. Severe illness resulted in marasmus in five patients and in the death of two others. Most of the ETEC strains (84%) were of ST toxin type. Correlation was found between the degree of toxigenity and the severity of the gastroenteritis. The most prevalent ETEC "O' serogroups were 0-6, 0-20, 0-8, 0-86, 0-126, 0-128 and 0167. Colonization Factors Antigens (CFAs) were identified in 36% of the isolates, CFAI was characteristic of group 0-126 and 0-128. In the principal O-groups there were high percentages of sensitivity to the antibiotics ceftriaxone, nalidixic-acid, gentamicin and norfloxacin, with resistance to anoxycillin, tetracycline and cotrimoxazole.
