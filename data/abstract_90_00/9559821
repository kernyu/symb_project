The aarE1 allele was identified on the basis of the resulting phenotype of increased aminoglycoside resistance. The aarE1 mutation also resulted in a small-colony phenotype and decreased levels of aac(2')-Ia mRNA. The deduced AarE gene product displayed 61% amino acid identity to the Escherichia coli UbiA protein, an octaprenyltransferase required for the second step of ubiquinone biosynthesis. Complementation experiments in both Providencia stuartii and E. coli demonstrated that aarE and ubiA are functionally equivalent.
