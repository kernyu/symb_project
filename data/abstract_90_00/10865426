The frequency of resistance and elevated resistance to teicoplanin and vancomycin among 689 strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated in one year from clinical specimens was determined. Using ATB.STAPH test, a resistance was shown mainly among strains of S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus. The elevated resistance to teicoplanin was much more frequently observed than to vancomycin. About 27% of isolated strains of S. haemolyticus and 6.8% of S. epidermidis were classified as resistant. Among other species only single strains were recognised as resistant: one strain of S. xylosus, one of S. cohni and one of S. intermedius. 94.7% of S. epidermidis and 100% of S. haemolyticus strains classified as resistant to teicoplanin in ATB showed MIC values 14 mg/l. Moreover it was shown that 26.3% of these strains of S. epidermidis and 33.3% of S. haemolyticus had MBC of teicoplanin values equal to or higher than 32 mg/l.
