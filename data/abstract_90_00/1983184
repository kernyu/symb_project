The 2'-fluoropyrimidine nucleoside analogs 1-(2-deoxy-2-fluoro-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl)-5-iodocytosine (FIAC). 1(2-deoxy-2-fluoro-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl)-5-methyluracil (FMAU), and 1(2-deoxy-2-fluoro-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl)-5-iodouracil (FIAU) showed higher in vitro activity against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), than equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) or pseudorabies virus (PRV). Comparison of the 50% plaque inhibitory doses for HSV-1 and its mutant MMdUr-20 in cell cultures with inhibition constants (Ki's) for the viral deoxythymidine kinases (dTKs) suggests that in the infected cell FMAU is phosphorylated by host enzymes. As compared to HSV-1, EHV-1 and PRV were more resistant to E-5-(2-bromovinyl-2'-deoxyuridine (BVdU) and to the 2'-fluoropyrimidine analogs, as are HSV-2 and the HSV-1 mutants MMdUr-20 and S1. Because the dTKs of the latter lack deoxythymidylate kinase (dTMPK) activity, there appears to be a correlation between resistance to these analogs and BVdU on the one hand, and lack of dTMPK activity on the other. We predict that EHV-1 and PRV dTKs will be shown to lack significant dTMPK activity.
