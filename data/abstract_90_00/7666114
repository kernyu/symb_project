Beta-lactamase activity was studied in 142 non-tuberculosis mycobacterial strains. The distribution according to species was as follows: four M. avium, 14 M. chelonae, 10 M. fortuitum, 59 M. gordonae, 55 M. kansasii. The spectrum of hydrolysis of the beta-lactamases was screened using an acidimetric method and the characterization was performed by analytical isoelectric focusing.
