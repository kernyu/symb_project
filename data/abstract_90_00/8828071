In order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefozopran (CZOP), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of CZOP and control drugs were determined against Streptococcus pneumoniae from children that were isolated from October of 1995 to January of 1996. Determinations were made for the detection frequency of penicillin-insensitive or resistant strains in biovar utilizing hydrolysis products, and for the correlation of antibacterial susceptibility and macrolides (MLs)-resistant patterns. The results are summarized as follows; 1. MIC90 of CZOP was < or = 0.025 micrograms/ml against benzylpenicillin (PCG)-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PSSP, 50 strains). MIC distribution of CZOP against these strains was approximately equal to that of PCG, and showed stronger activities of CZOP than those of ceftazidime (CAZ), flomoxef (FMOX) and erythromycin (EM). 2. MIC90 of CZOP was 0.39 micrograms/ml against 50 strains of PCG-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP) and PCG-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP). Antimicrobial activities of CZOP against these strains were stronger than those of CAZ, FMOX, PCG and EM. 3. These isolated strains of PISP and PRSP did not show type III biovar, but showed types I and II. The detection frequency of MLs-constitutive resistant strains were high among type III PSSP and those of MLs-inductive resistant strains were high among types I and II PISP and PRSP. These data suggested that CZOP had strong antimicrobial activities against multiple drug resistant S. pneumoniae including penicillin-resistant strains. CZOP will be effective against S. pneumoniae which often are causative organisms in infections of children.
