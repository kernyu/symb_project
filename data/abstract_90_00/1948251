Yaws has been resurgent in the island of Tanna in southern Vanatu in the 1980's. Screening, conducted in 1988 and in 1989 during a mass treatment program identified a total of 464 clinical cases from the population of 20,200, a rate of 23 per thousand. Most of these (82%) were under 15 years of age. Serology was performed on 286 of which 23% were VDRL positive. Primary care services had been hampered in controlling yaws by difficulties with transport, isolation, community resistance and the lack of skilled personel to diagnose yaws and arrange prophylactic treatment. A mass screening and treatment program was implemented in 1989 with 91.8% coverage. This program was designed to work in the context of primary health care and thus has enhanced the relationship between the health services and local villagers. The program was successfully integrated with other health activities including health education, treatment of other diseases and vector control.
