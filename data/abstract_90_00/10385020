The aim of this report was to study the evolution of susceptibilities of 1532 clinical isolates of Acinetobacter recovered over a period of 6 years. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 15 antimicrobial agents were determined for all the isolates. The respective percentages of resistant strains in the years 1991 and 1996 were as follows: ciprofloxacin, 54.4% and 90.4%; tobramycin, 33% and 71.8%; amikacin, 21% and 83.7%; ampicillin plus sulbactam, 65.7% and 84.1%; ceftazidime, 57.4% and 86.8%; ticarcillin, 70% and 89.4%; trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole, 41.1% and 88.9%; and imipenem, 1.3% and 80%. The MIC90s of ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, biapenem, meropenem, imipenem, cefepime, cefpirome, and rifampicin against 250 imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter strains were >32, >32, 128, >256, 256, >256, 256, and 16 mg/l, respectively. With serious infections, it was necessary to resort to the use of colistin, the only antibiotic active in vitro.
