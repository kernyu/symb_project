OBJECTIVE: The epidemiology of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) in Greece is not known. We have therefore conducted this prospective study to investigate the isolation rate of GAS from pediatric specimens, determine T-serotype frequency and examine the susceptibility of GAS to penicillin, erythromycin and clindamycin. METHODS: Over a 3-year study-period (1993-95) 11 597 clinical specimens obtained from sick children were inoculated on appropriate culture media. The isolation and identification of GAS strains were assessed by conventional methods. T-typing was performed by slide agglutination. Serum opacity factor (OF) was detected by microwell METHOD: The susceptibility of the strains was tested by the Kirby Bauer method. RESULTS: GAS were isolated from 1125 out of 11 597 (9.7%) clinical specimens, mostly from throat samples (15.6%). T-serotyping was performed in 652 GAS strains. A significant difference of the incidence of T-serotypes was observed within the 3 years studied (chi2 = 70.3, DF = 18, P < 0.001). The most dominant isolates were T-1 (25%), T-4 (20%) and T-12 (16%) during 1993, 1994 and 1995, respectively. Non-typeable (NT) strains were 4%. OF and hyaluronic acid were produced from 49.8% and 3% of the strains, respectively. All isolated strains were susceptible to penicillin and clindamycin. Resistance to erythromycin was 5.0-8.7% over the 3-year study period. CONCLUSIONS: There was a wide distribution of GAS T-serotypes in Athens and a significant change in their annual predominance. All strains were susceptible to penicillin and clindamycin, but a low level of erythromycin resistance was observed.
