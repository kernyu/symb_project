We compared the in vitro activity of a new triazole, D0870, with those of fluconazole, itraconazole, and ketoconazole against 41 clinical isolates of fluconazole-resistant Candida belonging to nine different species. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) were determined by a microdilution method with morpholinopropanesulfonic acid (MOPS)-buffered RPMI medium and an inoculum of approximately 10(4) yeasts per ml. After incubation for 48 h at 37 degrees C the optical density at 550 nm was measured. The IC50 was the lowest drug concentration which reduced the optical density at 550 nm by > or = 50% compared with that for a drug-free control. D0870 had significant activity against many of the isolates. Its activity was comparable to that of ketoconazole, slightly superior to that of itraconazole, and markedly superior to that of fluconazole against Candida albicans. Against Candida glabrata, Candida krusei, and Candida inconspicua, it had activity similar to those of itraconazole and ketoconazole but had activity superior to that of fluconazole. D0870 IC50s for some isolates were increased. This may be due to cross-resistance mechanisms because the IC50s of both itraconazole and ketoconazole for these isolates were often high. When IC50s and IC80s were compared there was a marked organism and drug variation. With C. glabrata much higher endpoints for itraconazole were observed when an IC80 endpoint was used. For C. albicans there was also a significant shift upward in endpoints for itraconazole and ketoconazole. Values were changed little when IC50 and IC80 endpoints of D0870 were compared. For 35 of 41 isolates tested the D0870 IC50 was less than the 2.5-mg/liter breakpoint threshold proposed previously. Therefore, D0870 may be a useful agent for the therapy of infections caused by fluconazole-resistant Candida spp.
