The influence of rimantadine-resistance mutations on the virulence of human H3N2 viruses in ferrets was examined. The similarities in virulence of the drug-resistant mutants with single amino acid substitutions at three different locations, 27, 30, and 31, within the M2 sequence and their corresponding sensitive wild-type isolates contrasted with differences in virulence between the three pairs of viruses. These data provide further evidence that rimantadine-resistant viruses that emerge during treatment of patients with the drug are unaltered both in their growth characteristics and virulence.
