Previously, the fructose-1,6-diphosphate-dependent L-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase gene of Streptococcus mutans JH1000 was cloned into Escherichia coli (J. D. Hillman, M. J. Duncan, and K. P. Stashenko, Infect. Immun. 58:1290-1295, 1990). In the present study, the nucleotide sequence of 1.29 kb of S. mutans DNA which contained the promoter and protein-coding region of the gene was determined. In vitro disruption of the gene was achieved by deletion of the promoter and a major portion of the protein-coding sequence. Subsequently, a tetracycline resistance gene from S. mutans was inserted at the deletion site as a marker for selection. In addition, evidence from Southern hybridization showed that S. mutans JH1000 contained a single copy of the lactate dehydrogenase gene.
