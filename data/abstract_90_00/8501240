A new latex agglutination test (Pastorex Staph-Plus, Sanofi Diagnostics Pasteur), consisting of a mixture of latex particles coated with fibrinogen and immunoglobulin G for the detection of clumping factor and protein A and latex particles sensitized with monoclonal antibodies directed to Staphylococcus aureus serotype 5 and 8 capsular polysaccharides, was compared with three commercially available rapid agglutination methods for the identification of 220 isolates of S. aureus (61 oxacillin resistant) and 128 isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci. The sensitivity for identification of S. aureus was high with the Pastorex Staph-Plus test (98.6%) compared with those of the other tests, which ranged from 91.8 to 84.5%. Test sensitivities for the identification of oxacillin-resistant S. aureus were as follows: Pastorex Staph-Plus, 95.1%; Pastorex Staph, 73.8%; Staphyslide, 72.1%; and StaphAurex, 49.2%.
