Coagulase-negative staphylococci were isolated from different raw milk cheeses and raw meat products and screened for their antibiotic resistances. They were identified as Staphylococcus xylosus, S. lentus, S. caprae, S. epidemidis and S. haemolyticus. The most frequent resistances found were those to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, erythromycin and lincomycin. They have been characterized on the molecular level. The chloramphenicol resistance genes were localized in several S. xylosus and S. caprae on plasmids with sizes ranging from 3.8-kb to 4.3-kb and were identified as chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat). All the tetracycline resistant strains were identified as S. xylosus and harboured a 4.4-kb plasmid carrying the tetracycline efflux resistance gene (tetK). The two erythromycin/lincomycin resistant S. caprae and S. epidermidis strains did not hybridize with the MLSB resistance genes ermAM, ermA, ermB and ermC. Three erythromycin resistant Staphylococcus sp. strains harboured an erythromycin efflux resistance gene (msr) localized twice on a 18-kb plasmid and once on the chromosome. A S. haemolyticus strain showing resistance to both lincomycin and clindamycin harboured a linA gene-carrying 2.2-kb plasmid. Further resistances to gentamicin, penicillin and kanamycin were less frequently observed and yet not characterized on a molecular level.
