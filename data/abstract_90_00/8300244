In 29 patients with community-acquired pneumonia, 24 patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia and 35 patients with pneumonia in the immunocompromised host the diagnostic value of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) with quantitative bacterial and fungal cultures was studied; 32 patients with noninfectious pulmonary diseases and 14 healthy volunteers served as controls. An infectious etiology could be established in 81% of the pneumonia patients without differences between the three groups; significant infection was associated with colony counts of > or = 10(4) cfu/ml. Prior antibiotic therapy lowered the yield of BAL culture only in community-acquired pneumonia (94% vs 55% positive cultures in untreated vs pretreated patients, p < 0.02). Furthermore the culture results were related to the radiographic extension of pulmonary infiltrates (92% positive cultures in multilobar vs 54% in lobar or segmental infiltrates, p < 0.001). Therapeutic consequences of BAL were shown by resistance of the isolated organisms to predefined empiric treatment regimens in 41% community-acquired pneumonia, 43% pneumonia in the immunocompromised host and 67% hospital-acquired pneumonia patients.
