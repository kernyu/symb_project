The paper deals with the identification of some Staphylococcus saprophyticus strains received by the Staphylococcus National Reference Centre, in the Cantacuzino Institute, Bucharest, Romania. The strains were isolated from blood cultures pre-elevated in a maternity in Bucharest from normoponderal newborns with septic arthritis. Recent data from literature concerning the infections caused by coagulase negative staphylococci in general, with special reference to those cause by S. saprophyticus are presented. The identification scheme used in the Cantacuzino Institute and the minimal microbiological diagnosis tests of S. saprophyticus recommended to the clinical laboratories by the International Society for the Taxonomy of Staphylococci and Micrococci are also described.
