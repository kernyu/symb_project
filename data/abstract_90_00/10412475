This study was aimed at clarifying the effects of two different silane compounds on the adhesion between the different fibres and acrylic resin. The fibres used as reinforcement in the acrylic resin test specimens were glass, carbon and aramid fibres and the silane treated and untreated versions of each type of the fibres were tested. The fracture resistance of the test specimens were assessed and the fibres were studied by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to establish the adhesion between the fibres and acrylic resin. The results showed that silanization of glass and aramid fibres enhances the adhesion between the fibres and acrylic resin. The findings were confirmed by the SEM photographs taken. The use of a scanning electron microscope proved to be useful for the investigation of the adhesive properties of the materials used.
