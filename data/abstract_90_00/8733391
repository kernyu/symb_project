Cyclosporin is a highly effective treatment for severe psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. However, both inter- and intrapatient gastrointestinal absorption of the conventional formulation of cyclosporin (Sandimmun) are very variable, ranging from 20 to 50%. Variations in bioavailability may explain isolated resistance to therapy. Neoral is a novel microemulsion formulation of cyclosporin which has been developed to enhance and standardize its absorption. We report the first experience with Neoral in patients with psoriasis and atopic dermatitis refractory to Sandimmun.
