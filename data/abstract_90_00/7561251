A nation-wide surveillance of sensitivities of bacteria, which were isolated from elderly patients with UTIs aged more than 65 in 190 private clinics and 73 hospitals, for oral antibacterials, CPFX, OFLX, NFLX, CPDX and CCL, was conducted in August and September in 1993. Antibacterial activities of 5 agents against all 1,511 strains were intensified in CPFX, OFLX, NFLX, CPDX and CCL in that order. Major pathogens such as Enterobacteriaceae, E. faecalis, Staphylococcus spp. and P. aeruginosa were more susceptible to fluoroquinolones than cephems. The rate of resistant strains to antibacterials was higher in isolates from older patients, patients with complicated UTIs and with indwelling catheter. The representative of resistant strains was P. aeruginosa, and about 50% of the strains of P. aeruginosa were resistant to even CPFX which had the most superior antibacterial activity among the 5 agents. About 40% of the S. aureus were MRSA, which were almost resistant to the 5 agents. From the above findings, it was confirmed that a high recovery rate of strains which is less susceptible to various antibacterials is one of the refractory factors in elderly patients with UTIs, particularly in complicated UTIs and with indwelling catheter. Regardless of the size of the clinic or hospital, Fluoroquinolones are more suitable for the treatment of elderly patients with UTIs than cephems.
