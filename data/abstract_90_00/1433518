Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV) has the unique ability to infect different cells via either a low-pH-dependent or a pH-independent entry pathway. Only the pH-independent mechanism of Mo-MuLV entry has been associated with Mo-MuLV-induced syncytium formation. We have now identified a transformed cell line (NIH 3T3/DTras) which efficiently forms syncytia when exposed to Mo-MuLV, yet is low pH dependent for Mo-MuLV entry. Treatment of NIH 3T3/DTras cells with chloroquine, an agent which raises endosomal pH, blocks Mo-MuLV entry, but not Mo-MuLV-induced syncytium formation. This demonstrates that fusion which accompanies viral entry and fusion which is responsible for syncytium formation occur as independent processes in these cells. In addition, we determined that neither inherent differences in the Mo-MuLV receptor nor reduced affinity for Mo-MuLV gp70 can account for resistance of NIH 3T3 cells to Mo-MuLV-induced syncytium formation.
