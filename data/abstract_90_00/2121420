144 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Ps.a) were serotyped and phage-typed. Antibiotic sensitivity test and case control study of nosocomial infection caused by Ps.a were also done for these strains. Three epidemic strains were collected from the ICU in a neurosurgical ward. The etiology of a cross infection among tracheotomy patients was two epidemic strains isolated from the hands of a nurse and an attendant. Hospitalization days longer than 56 days, tracheotomy and indwelling catheterization were 3 risk factors for Ps.a infection shown by logistic analysis. The sensitivity rate of Ps.a to antibiotics was highest with ceftazidine, followed by amikacin and piperacillin. The most common resistant antibiogram was Gentamycin and tobramycin Resistance to gentamicin increased obviously.
