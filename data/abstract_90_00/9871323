Albicidins are important factors in systemic pathogenesis by Xanthomonas albilineans, which causes the devastating leaf scald disease of sugar cane. They are also of substantial interest as antibiotics that selectively block prokaryote DNA replication. Albicidin biosynthesis is highly sensitive to medium composition. An optimized, chemically defined medium (SMG3) yielded 30-fold more albicidin from half the accumulated biomass, relative to sucrose peptone (SP) medium. Phosphate starvation stimulated albicidin production in SMG3 and SP media. Addition of other amino acids, ammonium ions or peptones to the defined medium increased the growth rate of X. albilineans XA3, but differentially inhibited albicidin biosynthesis. Knowledge of these factors indicates new approaches to understanding mechanisms of pathogenesis and resistance to sugar cane leaf scald disease, and to strain improvement for production of albicidin antibiotics.
