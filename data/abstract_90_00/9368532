An outbreak of multiresistant Klebsiella pneumoniae has continued in the Grampian Region of Scotland since 1992. The organism, which generally produces an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), has spread to several hospitals and nursing homes. DNA from 80 possible outbreak isolates was digested with the restriction endonucleases XbaI and SpeI, and the patterns obtained by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis were compared. Restriction patterns of 79 of the isolates were found to be highly similar with both restriction enzymes, whereas one isolate was unrelated. The outbreak isolates were divided into six subtypes with SpeI and 16 subtypes with XbaI. These subtypes were independent of antibiotic susceptibility pattern, date of isolation and ward of origin, but the XbaI subtype did correlate with the SpeI subtype. It was concluded that the Klebsiella isolates of this outbreak were clonally related.
