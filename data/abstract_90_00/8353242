Although nondiphtherial corynebacteria are ubiquitous in nature and commonly colonize the skin and mucous membranes of humans, they rarely account for clinical infection. Corynebacterium striatum has rarely been reported to be a pathogen, causing pleuropulmonary infections and bacteremia in only immunocompromised or anatomically altered patients. We noted C. striatum to be the infecting pathogen or copathogen in six patients. To our knowledge, this report describes the first cases of C. striatum causing infection of exist sites of central venous catheters, thrombophlebitis associated with central venous catheters, conjunctivitis, and chorioamnionitis as well as a possible pathogen contributing to peritonitis and pyogenic granuloma. Unlike Corynebacterium jeikeium, which is highly resistant to beta-lactam agents, aminoglycosides, and quinolones, all strains of C. striatum isolated from the patients described in this report were susceptible to vancomycin and aminoglycosides, and all strains except one were susceptible to penicillin G, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. C. striatum should be recognized as a potential pathogen in both immunocompromised and normal hosts in the appropriate circumstances, and appropriate antimicrobial therapy can quickly lead to resolution of infection.
