The plasmid profile of different species of mycobacteria vegetating in the Russian Federation was first studied. All the drug-resistant mycobacterial strains of tuberculosis were found to be truly polyresistant. There was a certain association between the plasmid carriage and the high viability of the mycobacterial population in nontuberculous mycobacteria.
