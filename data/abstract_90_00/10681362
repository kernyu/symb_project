Clinical blood isolates from three sequential episodes of endocarditis occurring over a 6-month period in a child with a malformative cardiopathy were investigated. All isolates identified as Abiotrophia defectiva were resistant to erythromycin-clindamycin and to tetracycline-minocycline, due to the presence of sequences homologous to the erythromycin resistance gene ermB and to the tetracycline resistance gene tet(M), respectively. These resistance genes were located on a chromosomally borne composite Tn916-related transposon. These results demonstrate the involvement of conjugative transposons in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance in the genus Abiotrophia.
