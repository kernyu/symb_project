Forty-one chemicals were tested for their abilities to induce trifluorothymidine resistance in L5178Y mouse lymphoma (MOLY) cells. These chemicals were included in the National Toxicology Program's evaluation of four in vitro short-term toxicity assays for predicting carcinogenicity in the rodent bioassay. Of the 41 chemicals examined for this report, 8 were equivocal in the rodent bioassay, and 7 were questionable in- the MOLY assay. If these chemicals are eliminated from an analysis of concordance, the remaining 26 chemicals lead to a concordance of 69% with a sensitivity of 71%. The specificity could not be determined because only two non-carcinogens were detected.
