Changes in susceptibilities to oral antimicrobials were investigated in 189 children, in whom Haemophilus influenzae was detected by nasopharyngeal culture, among the children who were diagnosed as having acute otitis media or chronic sinusitis with acute exacerbation in the Department of Otolaryngology in 1986, 1988 and 1991. The minimum 50% inhibitory concentration (MIC50) and minimum 90% inhibitory concentration (MIC90) of ampicillin (ABPC), cefaclor (CCL) and erythromycin (EM) in the subjects examined in 1986 were almost the same as the levels in those examined in 1991. The MIC50 level of minocycline (MINO) in the subjects examined in 1991 was lower by 2 test tubes than that determined in 1986, showing improvement in susceptibilities. The prevalence of resistance to antimicrobials was compared between 1986 and 1991. The prevalence to ABPC tended to decrease very slightly, while the prevalence to CCL tended to increase very slightly. The prevalence of EM tended to increase slightly. Many CCL-resistant strains detected in 1991 showed resistance to ABPC and EM, but showed favorable susceptibilities to cefixime and norfloxacin. Future trends of CCL-resistant strains should be carefully observed. There was no marked change in the prevalence of resistance to ABPC or CCL. ABPC and CCL were considered to be the first choice drugs, even at present, for pediatric patients with acute otitis media due to infection with H. influenzae and in those with acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis due to the infection.
