Enterococcus spp. isolated from surgical infections during the period from July 1982 to June 1995 were investigated in a multicenter study involving 19 hospitals in Japan, and the following results were obtained. 1. Though the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis and other Enterococcus spp. were not high from primary infections, and from postoperative infections the isolation rate of other Enterococcus spp. was also low, the isolation rate of E. faecalis was highest from postoperative infections after 1993. 2. Vancomycin (VCM) showed strongest activity against E. faecalis, and followed by those of ampicillin (ABPC), imipenem. levofloxacin (LVFX) and meropenem in this order. Against other Enterococcus spp., VCM showed strongest activity, and followed by those of ABPC and LVFX. There were no resistant strains against VCM.
