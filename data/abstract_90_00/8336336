The synthesis and antimicrobial activity of several new 1-carba-1-dethiacephalosporins is described. The discovery of unique activity of some of the analogues against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus led to the development of a structure-activity relationship designed to optimize this activity. The results of this investigation along with the pharmacokinetic characteristics of select compounds are described.
