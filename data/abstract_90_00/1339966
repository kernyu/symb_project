A study of Plasmodium falciparum sensitivity to chloroquine was carried out in 1988 and 1990 in 5 localities, representatives of different climatic areas of Burkina Faso. The 7-day in vivo standard test performed in 1988 showed a total clearance failure of 25%. No significant difference with 1990 data was found, except for an increase of the resistance in the area of Fada N'Gourma, close to the border with Benin, Niger and Togo.
