In intensive care units, treatment is primarily directed at the suspected pathogen. However, the risk of interaction with other concomitantly administered drugs, the possible accumulation when renal and, in particular, hepatic function are impaired, and the possible development of resistance play major roles when selecting a therapeutic regimen. Studies of interactions between the different antimicrobial substances and, in particular, interactions between the antibiotics and other drugs are urgently called for in the future.
