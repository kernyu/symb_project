The preparation and antibacterial activity of the 5''-guanidino (6) and 5''-amidino (7) derivatives of 4'-deoxybutirosin A (1) as well as the 5''-guanidino derivative (8) of butirosin A are described. The key intermediates, tetra-N-benzyloxycarbonyl-5''-azido derivatives were selectively reduced with NiCl2-NaBH4 to give the corresponding 5'-amino derivatives. Subsequent guanidination or amidination followed by deblocking afforded the final compounds 6, 7 and 8. The 5''-guanidino derivatives (6 and 8) were more active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria than the corresponding 5''-hydroxy derivatives (1 and butirosin A). Compound 6 was also active against a variety of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
