Centipeda minima, a herb used medicinally to treat sinus infections in Nepal, was found to contain three antibacterial sesquiterpene lactones, identified as 6-O-methylacrylylplenolin, 6-O-isobutyroylplenolin, and 6-O-angeloylplenolin. 6-O-Methylacrylylplenolin had not been previously isolated from C. minima. All three had activity against Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, with 6-O-isobutyroylplenolin being the most active.
