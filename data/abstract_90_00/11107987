Three cases of tuberculosis in immigrants are described here. The manifestations of tuberculosis in this group are often different from those seen in Danes--in casu tuberculosis of the lymph nodes, skin, bone, and intestines. Diagnosis is difficult, as Danish doctors are not familiar with the clinical picture. Language problems are common and often necessitate the presence of an interpreter. Immigrants tend to move around without notifying the responsible doctor and the resources needed to find them may not be readily available. These factors may cause a considerable delay--from months to years--in the diagnosis and treatment. Doctors examining immigrants from Africa and Asia should be aware of tuberculosis as a possible cause of disease. Secretion and biopsies from fistulae, chronic ulcerations, lymph nodes, and abscesses should always be cultured for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The Mantoux reaction can be misleadingly negative in patients suffering from severe tuberculosis. Identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is not necessary for treatment--that decision is made on the clinical picture. On the other hand material for a bacteriological diagnosis should always be obtained, because of possible resistance problems.
