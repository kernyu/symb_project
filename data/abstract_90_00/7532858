Reverse transcription is one step of the retroviral development which can be inhibited by antisense oligonucleotides complementary to the RNA template. 2'-O-Alkyl oligoribonucleotides are of interest due to their nuclease resistance, and to the high stability of the hybrids they form with RNA. Oligonucleotides, either fully or partly modified with 2'-O-alkyl residues, were targeted to an RNA template to prevent cDNA synthesis by the Avian Myeloblastosis Virus reverse transcriptase (AMV RT). Fully-modified 2'-O-allyl 17mers were able to specifically block reverse transcription via an RNase H-independent mechanism, with efficiencies comparable to those observed with phosphodiester (PO) and phosphorothioate oligonucleotides. Sandwich 2'-O-alkyl/PO/2'-O-alkyl oligonucleotides, supposed to combine the properties of 2'-O-alkyl modifications (physical blocking of the RT) to those of the PO window (RNase H-mediated cleavage of the RNA) were quasi-stoichiometric inhibitors when adjacent to the primer, but remained without any effect when non-adjacent. They were not able to compete with the polymerase and inhibited reverse transcription only through RNase H-mediated cleavage of the target.
