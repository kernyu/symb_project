Hyperoxic ventilation, used to prevent hypoxemia during potential periods of hypoventilation, has been reported to paradoxically decrease whole body oxygen consumption (VO2). Reduction in nutritive blood flow due to oxygen radical production is one possible mechanism. We investigated whether pretreatment with the sulfhydryl group donor and O2 radical scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) would preserve whole body VO2 and prevent deterioration of oxygenation in gastric mucosal tissue during hyperoxia. Thirty-eight patients, requiring hemodynamic monitoring (radial and pulmonary artery catheters) due to sepsis syndrome, were included in this randomized experiment. All patients exhibited stable clinical conditions (hemodynamics, body temperature, hemoglobin, FIO2 < 0.5). A gastric tonometer was placed to measure the gastric intramucosal pH (pHi), which indirectly assesses nutritive blood flow to the mucosa. Cardiac output was determined by thermodilution and VO2 by cardiovascular Fick. After baseline measurements, patients randomly received either 150 mg.kg-1 NAC (n = 19) or placebo (n = 19) in 250 ml 5% dextrose intravenously over a period of 15 min. Measurements were repeated 30 min after starting NAC or placebo infusion, 30 min after starting hyperoxia (FIO2 = 1.0), and 60 min after resetting the original FIO2. There were no significant differences between groups in any of the measurements before treatment and after the return to baseline FIO2 at the end of the study. NAC, but not placebo infusion, caused a slight but significant increase in cardiac output and decrease in systemic vascular resistance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
