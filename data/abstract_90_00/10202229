Antibiotic resistance among the three major respiratory pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis) has increased dramatically over the past 15 years, around the world. With S pneumoniae, penicillin resistance is reported in almost a quarter of isolates, with multiple resistance an increasing problem. The major concern with H influenzae is ampicillin resistance, mediated through two different mechanisms. In the case of M catarrhalis, beta-lactamase production is almost universal, although resistance to other antibiotics is rare. The increasing prevalence of resistance underscores the need for new effective antibiotics. The new quinolones have a spectrum of activity that parallels the range of common respiratory pathogens.
