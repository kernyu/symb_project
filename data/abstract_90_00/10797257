Multifocal tumor recurrence of glioblastomas occurs in up to 14% of patients. In a parallel phase-II-study investigating post-operative treatment with tamoxifen (TAM), carboplatin and radiation therapy for glioblastomas, 16 of 49 patients (33%) showed multifocal recurrence, which developed after a mean of 46 weeks, raising the question of an association with therapy. We studied the interrelation of proliferation and migration in the presence of different protein-kinase-C(PKC) inhibitors (TAM, staurosporine, hypericin) in 2 glioma cell lines. In addition, 3 cell lines were selected for TAM resistance by repeated cycles of treatment with sub-lethal concentrations of TAM. The proliferative capacity and the invasive potential of selected sub-populations were assessed using growth-curve experiments, monolayer migration, and cell-adhesion assays. Treatment with all PKC inhibitors tested resulted in a dose-dependent decrease of proliferation, while motility was altered only at significantly higher doses. Resistance to TAM occurred in all 3 selected cell lines. The TAM-resistant sub-populations showed significantly increased proliferation, migration and adhesion as compared with the parental (non-selected) cell line. The higher incidence of multifocal disease after TAM treatment was paralleled by increased migratory potential of TAM-treated cells in vitro.
