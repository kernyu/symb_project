OBJECTIVE: To explore the characteristics of human schistosome antigen-specific IFN-gamma response in a population in an area endemic for schistosomiasis japonica. METHODS: Three neighboring villages were chosen on Nanshan Island of Poyang Lake. 65 egg-negative persons and 64 egg-positive ones were selected randomly from the residents aged 14-41 years according to the egg counts by Kato-Katz thick smear method. IFN-gamma was measured in the whole blood culture supernatant after stimulated by the schistosome soluble egg antigen (SEA) and soluble worm antigen preparations (SWAP). Serum isotype-restricted antibody was detected by ELISA. RESULTS: IFN-gamma levels induced by both SEA and SWAP were increased significantly after praziquantel treatment. The SEA-specific IFN-gamma level of the uninfected group was much higher than that of the reinfected group. A negative correlation between IFN-gamma level and IgG4 production was found, reflecting that IFN-gamma might be associated with the resistance to schistosome reinfection. CONCLUSION: The changes in IFN-gamma level might play an important role in association with the resistance to schistosome reinfection.
