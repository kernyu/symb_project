We have found a factor (Factor T) in aged mixtures of tungstate and phosphate which greatly enhances the antibacterial effects of beta-lactams on both inducible and constitutive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, but not on methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. Factor T alone did not strongly inhibit bacterial growth. There was no synergism of Factor T with other classes of antibiotics, nor with other groups of bacteria, and it reduced the efficacy of amino-glycosides and tetracycline. Upon preparation of Factor T, acidifying and heating the mixture of tungstate and phosphate resulted in a high yield and reproducibility, and no enhancing effect was observed when other anions such as sulfate or molybdate were used instead. Factor T is heat- and acid-stable but labile to alkalization, and is probably a complex of phosphate and tungstate.
