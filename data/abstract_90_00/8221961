Tetrandrine were given to nine patients with pulmonary hypertension secondary to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the effects of central hemodynamics and blood gases were studied. 60 minutes after the administration of the medicine, total pulmonary vascular resistance (TPVR) and pulmonary artery mean pressure (mPAP) were reduced by 23% (from 59.2 KPa.s/L to 45.6k Pa.s/L (1 kPa = 7.5 mmHg, P < 0.05) and 15% (from 4.0 kPa to 3.4 kPa, P < 0.05) respectively. Systemic artery mean pressure (mSAP) only decreased by 4.9%. There were no significant differences between the values of cardiac output (co), PaO2, SaO2 before and after the administration of tetrandrine.
