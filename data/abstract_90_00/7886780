The activity of bacitracin in vitro against Giardia intestinalis, Trichomonas vaginalis and Tritrichomonas foetus was enhanced 5-10 times by equimolar concentrations of zinc. Bacitracin and bacitracin zinc activity was tolerant to either aerobic or anaerobic culture conditions and equally effective against T. vaginalis isolates sensitive or insensitive to metronidazole. This enhancement was not due to zinc toxicity and was zinc dose dependent.
