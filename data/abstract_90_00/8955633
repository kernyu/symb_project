Little is known about the signal transduction events that lead to the establishment of the broad-spectrum, inducible plant immunity called systemic acquired resistance (SAR). Salicylic acid (SA) accumulation has been shown to be essential for the expression of SAR and plays a key role in SAR signaling. Hydrogen peroxide has been proposed to serve as a second messenger of SA. However, our results do not support such a role in the establishment of SAR. Further elucidation of SAR signal transduction has been facilitated by the identification and characterization of mutants. The lesions simulating disease (lsd). resistance response mutant class exhibits spontaneous lesions similar to those that occur during the hypersensitive response. Interestingly, some lsd mutants lose their lesioned phenotype when SA accumulation is prevented by expression of the nahG gene (encoding salicylate hydroxylase), thereby providing evidence for a feedback loop in SAR signal transduction. Characterization of a mutant non-responsive to SAR activator treatments has provided additional evidence for common signaling components between SAR and gene-for-gene resistance.
