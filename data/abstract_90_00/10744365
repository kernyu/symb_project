In-vitro susceptibility studies were performed on 99 clinical Staphylococcus aureus isolates. A total of 68 of 73 methicillin-resistant S. aureus and 2 of 26 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus were gentamicin-resistant (gentamicin MIC range 16 to 1,024 microg/mL). All 70 gentamicin-resistant isolates contained the aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia aminoglycoside resistance gene, and none possessed the aph(2'')-Ic or aph(2'')-Id aminoglycoside resistance genes. The arbekacin MIC for the 70 gentamicin-resistant isolates ranged from 0.25 to 4 microg/mL. The combination of arbekacin plus vancomycin produced synergistic killing against 12 of 13 gentamicin-resistant MRSA isolates. The combination of gentamicin plus vancomycin produced synergistic killing against 7 of the same 13 isolates. Arbekacin may prove useful when used in combination with vancomycin in treating infections caused by gentamicin-resistant MRSA.
