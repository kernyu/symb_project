Recent insights into HIV dynamics argue strongly for early intervention with antiretroviral combinations designed to block resistant mutations. By using more potent agents and taking advantage of drug selective pressure to force the emergence of strains with reduced evolutionary fitness, investigators are attempting to bring HIV replication to a halt. And in many cases, they appear to be succeeding.
