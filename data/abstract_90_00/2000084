We have successfully bridged the intergeneric barriers between Nicotiana and Solanum with respect to chondriome transfer. To enable this transfer we utilized the donor-recipient protoplast-fusion procedure. Consequently protoplasts of a Nicotiana sylvestris line with putatively oligomycin-resistant mitochondria (line OliR38) were used as irradiated chondriome donors and iodoacetate-treated protoplasts of Solanum tuberosum cv. Desiree served as recipients. The plated fusion products as well as their derived colonies and calli were exposed to gradually increasing levels of oligomycin. The resulting plantlets had potato morphology and were analyzed with respect to their mitochondrial DNA and chloroplast DNA. Fifteen out of 50 regenerated plants were verified as true cybrids. Detailed analyses of one cybrid revealed chondriome components from the oligomycin-resistant donor line, OliR38, but retention of the plastome of potato. This cybrid was oligomycin-resistant as revealed by root-culture analysis. It was thus verified that due to selection, chondriome components could be transferred from a N. sylvestris donor into a cybrid having all the phenotypic features controlled by the nucleus of the recipient fusion partner (S. tuberosum).
