Cefepime, a new cephalosporin which has a broad-spectrum of activity was tested in vitro against 1961 Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinical isolates obtained from European hospitals. Cefepime was highly active against Gram-negative organisms, inhibiting over 94% of strains tested. The overall susceptibility rate for cefepime against all isolates was 81%. Cefepime was more active than any of the third-generation cephalosporins tested against species capable of producing type I beta-lactamases, e.g. Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter aerogenes. The activity of cefepime against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of ceftazidime and substantially greater than those of cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. All cephalosporins except ceftazidime exhibited high activity against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus but poor activity was observed against methicillin-resistant strains. Overall susceptibility to cefepime is lower in Europe than it is in North America.
