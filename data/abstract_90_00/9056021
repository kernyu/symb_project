We have developed a rapid PCR-oligonucleotide ligation assay that can discriminate single base substitutions that are associated with clarithromycin resistance in Helicobacter pylori. Susceptible isolates were wild type at positions 2143 and 2144 (cognate to 2058 and 2059 in Escherichia coli), while 93% of the resistant isolates contained A-to-G mutations at either position and 7% of the isolates contained A-to-C mutations at position 2143. In addition, the MIC for 86% of the resistant isolates with an A2143 mutation was > or = 64 micrograms per ml, and that for 89% of the resistant isolates with an A2144 mutation was < or = 32 micrograms per ml.
