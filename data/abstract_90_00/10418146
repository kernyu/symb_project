By repeating the cycle of mutagenesis and selection, the Escherichia coli dnaQ49 mutator acquired high level resistance to ampicillin (30,000 micrograms ml-1), streptomycin (26,000 micrograms ml-1) and ofloxacin (3000 micrograms ml-1). Under the strong pressure of ofloxacin, dnaQ49 also followed the history of mutations in the gyrase and topoisomerase i.v. genes previously observed in clinical isolates of quinolone-resistant E. coli. The results of these in vitro experiments suggest that naturally existing mutators may participate in the rapid acquisition of resistance to various antibiotics in patients. A possible mechanism for the occurrence of this adaptability is discussed with special reference to the property of mutagenesis accompanying DNA replication.
