Five clinical isolates of Mycoplasma hominis from three different patients were examined for resistance to fluoroquinolones; some of these isolates were probably identical. All five isolates harbored amino acid substitutions in the quinolone resistance-determining regions of both DNA gyrase (GyrA) and topoisomerase IV (ParC or ParE). Furthermore, the novobiocin MIC for three isolates showed a significant increase. This is the first characterization of fluoroquinolone-resistant clinical mycoplasma isolates from humans.
