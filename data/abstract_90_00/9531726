The incidence of Campylobacter in poultry meat production and in poultry meat gives cause for increasing concern in this field. Results of studies about clinical cases of Campylobacter in humans show a growing tendency. With poultry and foal mainly C. jejuni and C. coli are isolated, while C. jejuni has been identified as one of the most frequent bacterial pathogens of enteritis in humans also. Of altogether 509 samples from poultry herds, 209 isolates (41.1%) were Campylobacter positive. Tests in slaughter-houses showed that there are various factors that influence the contamination of the carcass during the process of slaughtering. The number of positive cases with chicken carcass is about 45.9% which is higher than with the animals, flocks. Of 52 pheasants 25.9% were Campylobacter positive. During the last 3 years Campylobacter isolates showed a growing Chinolone resistance (19.14% in butchered roast chicken and 28.5% in pheasants.
