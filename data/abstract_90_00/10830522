New imidazole compounds were synthesized to develop a novel and effective antibacterial agent (1-benzyl-3-cetyl-2-methylimidazolium iodide, NH125). In vitro experiments demonstrated that NH125 effectively inhibited a number of different histidine protein kinases. Furthermore, oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (ORSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRS), and other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were found to be very sensitive to NH125.
