Increasing malaria treatment failures with chloroquine (C25) and reports of chloroquine resistant Plasmodium falciparum (CRPF) led to the field survey of two sites (Agbani and Jato-Aka) both in Primary Health Zone A, using WHO--in vivo seven-day test, modified to 14-day follow-up period. Of the 922 children studied, high transmission rates of 40 pc and 59.2 pc were found in Agbani and Jato-Aka respectively. Varying degrees of parasitologic failures (CRPF), 52 pc in Agbani and 60 pc in Jato-Aka were confirmed. However, chemotherapy with C25 significantly reduced the clinical symptoms of malaria infection, even in the CRPF-cases. The clinical success in the two study sites were 69 pc ad 94 pc respectively.
