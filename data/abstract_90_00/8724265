Our objective is to evaluate endoscopically-diagnosed antral nodularity in adults and its relationship to lymphoid hyperplasia (LH) and Helicobacter pylori (HP). Antral biopsy specimens were studied for inflammation, presence of HP, and lymphoid follicles. Patients with marked functional dyspepsia or recurrent duodenal ulcers were given triple therapy (bismuth subcitrate, tetracycline, and metronidazole in the recommended doses for 2 weeks) to eradicate HP. Follow-up endoscopy and biopsies, at least 4 weeks after finishing treatment, were performed to assess eradication of HP and its effect on nodularity and LH. In all 25 patients (age range, 20-42 years) with antral nodularity, biopsy specimens were positive for HP. Twenty (80%) of subjects had lymphoid follicles; 13 of these 20 were given triple therapy. Eradication of HP was achieved in five cases (38%). Patients in whom HP was successfully eradicated showed improvement of their symptoms; antral nodularity subsided and there was marked regression of the lymphoid follicles. Antral nodularity with LH, reported to be unique to children, is not uncommon in adults and is induced by HP, eradication of which leads to regression of nodularity and LH in most cases. Low eradication rates achieved with metronidazole-based triply therapy is due, possibly, to primary resistance to metronidazole. Long-term follow-up of such patients is required to assess the evolution of these findings.
