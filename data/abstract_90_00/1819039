Six groups of nystatin resistant mutants of C. maltosa and of haploid and diploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains were obtained with the help of genetic and biochemical analysis. It has been shown that every group of the mutants was characterized by a specific level of resistance to nystatin. The dependence of the resistance level upon sterol content has been established. It has been shown that the more the structure of the sterol present differed from ergosterol the higher was the resistance level. The results obtained in vivo permit to make conclusions about the role of different functional groups of sterol molecule in the interaction with nystatin.
