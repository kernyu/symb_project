It was recently demonstrated that a bis(benzyl)polyamine analog (MDL 27695; N,N'-bis(3-[(phenylmethyl)amino]propyl)-1,7-diaminoheptane) possessed potent antimalarial activity in vitro and in vivo (A. J. Bitonti, J. A. Dumont, T. L. Bush, M. L. Edwards, D. M. Stemerick, P. P. McCann, and A. Sjoerdsma, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:651-655, 1989). We now report that MDL 27695 also has potent antileishmanial activity, eliminating 77 to 100% of Leishmania donovani amastigotes from mouse peritoneal macrophages in vitro at 1 microM. Administration of 15 mg of MDL 27695 per kg three times per day for 5 days to L. donovani-infected mice suppressed parasite burdens in liver, spleen, and bone marrow by 83 to 96, 90, and 87%, respectively, and by 99.9% in livers of mice given the same dose two times per day for 10 days. Liver parasites were suppressed 74% in L. donovani-infected hamsters treated three times per day for 4 days with 5 mg of MDL 27695 per kg. The 50% effective doses for MDL 27695 were 2.5 mg/kg in mice and about 1 mg/kg in hamsters. In hamsters, MDL 27695 was equally effective against both antimony-susceptible and antimony-resistant L. donovani, suggesting a different mechanism of action for the two types of drugs. Coadministration of N1,N4-bis(butadienyl)-butanediamine (MDL 72527) to mice to inhibit host polyamine oxidase, and hence the formation of oxidative metabolites of MDL 27695, did not affect the antileishmanial activity of MDL 27695. Thus, the mechanism of action of MDL 27695 does not appear to be related to its oxidation to toxic metabolites but may involve interference with DNA and RNA syntheses as found previously in Plasmodium falciparum (Bitonti et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:651-655, 1989).
