An open-label prospective study was performed employing intramuscularly administered imipenem as an adjunct to surgery in 20 patients with acute cholecystitis and 24 patients with perforated or gangrenous appendicitis. Three (12.5%) septic failures occurred in appendicitis patients and 2 (10%) failures in cholecystitis patients. There were no deaths. Adverse effects were minor, and there was no toxicity. Although failures were not associated with in vitro resistance, Pseudomonas spp. were recovered from 2 of 3 appendicitis failures. Intramuscular imipenem appeared to be an effective single-drug antimicrobial when used as an adjunct to surgery in patients with acute cholecystitis or perforated appendicitis. It should be a more cost-effective alternative to the current multiple-drug therapy frequently employed in patients with intra-abdominal sepsis.
