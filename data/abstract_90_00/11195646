Solutions of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-Tris showed synergistic or additive effects on gram-negative bacteria when combined with hatchery disinfectants consisting of phenol and detergent (Magnaphen-100), quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) and glutaraldehyde (Synergize), QAC (BioSentry 904), and hydrogen peroxide. The gram-positive bacteria reacted less favorably, with reaction mixtures showing all three levels of potentiation (synergistie, additive, and antagonistic). Combinations of EDTA-Tris and a commercial glutaraldehyde solution (Glutracide), when mixed with the test organisms, showed mostly antagonistic effects. Solutions of EDTA-Tris decreased the concentration of hatchery disinfectants required for bacterial killing by 75% in those situations in which synergistic potentiation occurred. EDTA-Tris is nontoxic to 12-day-old embryos. Serial passage of the test organisms in solutions of EDTA-Tris did not result in the development of resistant forms.
