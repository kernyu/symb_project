We examined the effect of vesnarinone, an oral cardiotonic, on the growth and differentiation of human myeloid leukemia cells. Vesnarinone alone markedly induced erythroid differentiation of HEL cells. All-trans-retinoic acid also induced erythroid differentiation of the cells, and the differentiation was greatly enhanced by combined treatment with vesnarinone and retinoic acid. HEL cells are highly resistant to some anticancer drugs, including vincristine, but treatment with vesnarinone greatly increased the sensitivity of HEL cells to vincristine. Enhancement of vincristine sensitivity by vesnarinone was not as significant for other leukemia cells. Expression of P-glycoprotein in HEL cells was effectively inhibited by vesnarinone, suggesting that the restoration of vincristine sensitivity is associated with decrease of P-glycoprotein expression in HEL cells. The plasma level of vesnarinone required to induce differentiation of leukemia cells is 30 micrograms/mL, which could be achieved with oral administration. These results suggest that vesnarinone should be useful in differentiation therapy for some types of myelogenous leukemia.
