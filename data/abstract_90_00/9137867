BACKGROUND: Mutations in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) gene confer resistance to antiviral drugs acting on RT. Current methods employed to detect such resistance require time-consuming culture techniques during which selective pressures may affect the outcome of the test. OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether drug-susceptible and drug-resistant HIV-1 derived from clinical specimens could be distinguished by the effects of the active form of the drug on the enzyme activity in a quantitative, cell-free RT assay. STUDY DESIGN: Polyethylene glycol (PEG)-precipitated virus was obtained from 7-day culture supernatants. RT activity in the lysed viral extracts was measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of the active form of the drug being tested. IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) values were determined by application of the median effect equation. RESULTS: Assays from nine post-nevirapine therapy isolates gave IC50 values at least 2 logs greater than pre-nevirapine isolates. The method also correctly distinguished between isolates sensitive and resistant to 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (ddI), but not between the ZDV-sensitive and ZDV-resistant isolates tested. The results agreed with data obtained by sequencing and by culture-based susceptibility assays.
