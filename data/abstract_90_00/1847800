Viral mRNA encoding vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein sequences was detected and quantitated using a DNA-hybridization dot-blot technique. This assay was employed to determine if the synthetic double-stranded polynucleotide complex of polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid would elicit viral resistance in vitro in single day 9 bovine embryos. The levels of viral mRNA were assayed in 4 groups of bovine embryos: unexposed, virus-exposed, polynucleotide-treated, and virus plus polynucleotide treated. Reduced quantities of viral mRNA in single polynucleotide treated embryos demonstrated that resistance to viral infection was induced in day 9 bovine embryos.
