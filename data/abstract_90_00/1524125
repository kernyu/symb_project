Ciprofloxacin, a new broad-spectrum antibiotic effective against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, has recently become available in topical ophthalmic solution (3 mg/ml) for the treatment of bacterial keratitis. It has rapidly become the drug of choice in treating bacterial keratitis. We treated three patients with bacterial corneal ulcers that were resistant to ciprofloxacin, yet were effectively treated with other topical antimicrobial agents. The initial culture results are important in the therapy of corneal ulcers.
