In the search for new antibiotics active against macrolide-resistant pneumococci and Haemophilus influenzae, we synthesized a new class of 3-oxo-6-O-methylerythromycin derivatives, so-called "ketolides". A keto function was introduced in position 3 after removal of L-cladinose, a sugar which has long been thought essential. Further modifications of the macrolactone backbone allowed us to obtain three different series of 9-oxime, 11,12-carbamate, and 11, 12-hydrazonocarbamate ketolides. These compounds were found to be very active against penicillin/erythromycin-resistant pneumococci and noninducers of MLSB resistance. The 11,12-substituted ketolide 61 (HMR 3004) demonstrated a potent activity against multiresistant pneumococci associated with a well-balanced activity against all bacteria involved in respiratory infections including H. influenzae, Mycoplasma catarrhalis, group A streptococci, and atypical bacteria. In addition HMR 3004 displayed high therapeutic activity in animals infected by all major strains, irrespective of their resistance phenotype.
