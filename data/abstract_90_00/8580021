The efficacy of rifampin in eliminating Staphylococcus aureus colonization was evaluated in a pediatric peritoneal dialysis population. Six children with documented nasal colonization were treated for 7 days with rifampin and cloxacillin. Although antimicrobial therapy eliminated nasal carriage in all patients, recolonization occurred in 66%. Exit site colonization proved difficult to eradicate with negative cultures documented in only 3 of 5 children after rifampin/cloxacillin therapy. Although S. aureus carriage is a risk factor for S. aureus infections, efforts to eradicate carriage with rifampin are hindered by rapid recolonization.
