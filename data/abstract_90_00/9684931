The biological heterogeneity of AML makes growth factor augmentation of cell cycle-dependent chemotherapy unlikely to be successful for all patients. Patients whose leukemic cells empirically demonstrate cytokine-induced chemosensitization in vitro might benefit from the concurrent administration of growth factors during consolidation chemotherapy. We have explored the growth factor-dependence and response of primary bone marrow samples from patients with AML at diagnosis, remission, and relapse to determine whether minimal residual leukemia remains growth factor-responsive. Most cases of AML studied at all phases of treatment were growth factor-responsive. Growth factor response of occult remission clonogenic leukemic precursors (CFU-L) was usually concordant with their response at diagnosis. Occult CFU-L were markedly resistant to cytosine arabinoside (median LD99% 20 microM); preincubation with IL-3 or GM-CSF did not significantly improve their ara-C sensitivity. While occult remission CFU-L appear to remain growth factor-responsive, it appears unlikely that growth factor augmentation of consolidation chemotherapy will overcome the important problem of drug resistance of residual leukemia.
