To evaluate the in vitro sensitivities of trimetoprim (TMP) in our area and to compare them with those to co-trimoxazole (CMX) a prospective study was carried out in females with uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection (UCLUTI), as a preliminary step for the possible use of a monodose of TMP in these patients. Fifty-five cases of UCLUTI were included. Escherichia coli was the predominating organism (70.9%). The general sensitivity to CMX was 80% and that to TMP 76.4%. The E. coli sensitivity to CMX was 79.5%, and 76.9% to TMP. The difference in the sensitivities to both antimicrobials was not statistically significant (p = 0.5). The routine introduction of TMP in the antibiogram would permit to evaluate the resistance to this antimicrobial in each area and, on the basis of the results, to assess the effectiveness of TMP in the treatment of UCLUTI.
