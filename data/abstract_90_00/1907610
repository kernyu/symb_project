We compared the MicroScan Pos MIC Type 6 panel and AMS-Vitek Gram Positive Susceptibility Card (GPS-TA) to agar dilution screen plates for the detection of high-level aminoglycoside resistance in 182 enterococcal isolates. The specificity of the two commercial systems was 100%, with the exception of one susceptible isolate found to be streptomycin resistant by the Vitek system. The MicroScan and Vitek systems had comparable sensitivities for the detection of gentamicin resistance (90 and 95% respectively) and streptomycin resistance (85 and 78%, respectively). These results suggest that screening tests such as agar dilution screen plates, broth dilution, or disk diffusion should continue to be used to detect high-level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance.
