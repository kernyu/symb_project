Uncomplicated falciparum malaria patients were randomly assigned to receive either 25 mg/kg chloroquine (CHL) over 3 d or a statim dose of 25 mg/kg sulfadoxine (SDX) plus 1.25 mg/kg pyrimethamine (PYR). Patients were followed up for 28 d and the parasite response graded according to World Health Organization criteria. Overall resistance to CHL was 63.3% and 47.4% to SDX/PYR. RI, RII and RIII rates were 9.1%, 42.4% and 12.1% for CHL and 10.5%, 21.1% and 15.8% for SDX/PYR, respectively. Degree and rates of resistance to CHL were significantly correlated with pre-treatment parasite density, but not those to SDX/PYR. Plasma CHL and SDX/PYR levels were within the reported ranges and were not significantly different in patients with sensitive and resistant responses.
