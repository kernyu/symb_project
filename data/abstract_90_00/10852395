The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was measured to evaluate the antibacterial activities of chloramphenicol (CP), thiamphenicol (TP) and florfenicol (FFC) against the aquatic bacterial isolates from soft-shell turtles, fish and shellfish. Amoxicillin (AMPC), oxytetracycline (OTC) and oxolinic acid (OA) were included to compare with above protein synthesis inhibitors. The results showed that the order of MIC range of the isolates from soft-shell turtles for tested drugs was OA>FFC, CP>TP> AMPC, OTC. The percentage of the resistant strains indicated that OA was the lowest (7.14%) and OTC was the highest (85.07%). The order of antibacterial activity against the isolates from fish was OA>FFC>CP>AMPC>OTC>TP. The percentage of the resistant strains revealed that OA (13.64%) and OTC (80.91%) were the lowest and the highest, respectively. For the isolates from shellfish, the order of antimicrobial activity was OA>CP, FFC>AMPC, OTC, TP. TP showed the greatest percentage of the resistant strains (58.7%), but that of OA was the lowest (4.35%). The most common resistant patterns of the isolates from turtles, fish and shellfish were AMPC-OTC, CP-TP-AMPC-OTC, and FFC-CP-TP-AMPC-OTC, respectively. There were partially-complete resistance of the resistant isolates among CP, TP and FFC. The findings indicated that previous treatment might affect the choice of drug to use for aquatic bacterial diseases.
