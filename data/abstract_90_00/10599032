The distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility of coagulase-negative staphylococci from skin lesions were investigated. Staphylococcus epidermidis was found on all areas of the body, whereas S. capitis, S. haemolyticus and S. hominis were mainly found on the face/head or arm/leg. The distribution of coagulase-negative staphylococci in skin lesions and at the same location on normal skin was similar. Staphylococcus lugdunensis was the most susceptible to the nine tested antimicrobials (benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, erythromycin, minocycline, gentamicin, vancomycin and ofloxacin) and S. epidermidis the least susceptible. S. haemolyticus also showed low susceptibility to all nine antimicrobials. Low susceptibility to penicillins may be explained by beta-lactamase production. The existence of coagulase-negative staphylococci, especially concerning their potential pathogenicity and multiple drug resistance, should not be neglected.
