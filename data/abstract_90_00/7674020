Retrovirus-mediated herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) gene therapy is a promising approach in the treatment of brain tumors. Previous in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated a bystander effect in which nonmodified tumor cells in proximity to HSV-tk-modified tumor cells are killed with the modified cells in the presence of ganciclovir. In the present study the authors assessed the contribution of infectious HSV-tk retrovirus made by producer cells to the bystander cytocidal effect in tissue culture using Walker 256 rat breast carcinosarcoma cells, which represent an established model for carcinomatous meningitis. The authors observed ganciclovir-dependent growth inhibition even when only one HSV-tk-positive Walker cell was mixed with 1000 HSV-tk-negative Walker cells and showed that the bystander cytocidal effect is not mediated by toxic cell lysis products. Walker cells engineered to produce HSV-tk retrovirus with titers ranging from 10(3) to 10(5) colony-forming units/ml exert no greater cytocidal effect than nonviral producer HSV-tk-positive Walker cells in vitro. Murine fibroblast-producer cells with viral titers ranging from 10(6) to 10(7) colony-forming units/ml exerted a stronger cytocidal effect than nonviral producer HSV-tk-positive murine fibroblasts. Despite the high viral titers of fibroblast producer cells, HSV-tk-modified Walker cells performed better than fibroblast producer cells in their cytotoxic effect on wild-type Walker tumor cells. Given that HSV-tk-modified tumor cells can become ganciclovir resistant, we tested gamma-irradiation as a means to overcome resistance. Lethal gamma-irradiation of the HSV-tk-positive Walker cells did not abolish their bystander effect on Walker HSV-tk-negative cells. One can infer from these results that HSV-tk-modified tumor cells, irradiated or not, may be a better alternative to murine fibroblast producer cells in the treatment of central nervous system neoplasia.
