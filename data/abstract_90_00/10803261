Proteus mirabilis strains (88 isolates) from hospitalised patients with urinary tract infection were tested for antibiotic susceptibility, ESBL production and their ability to produce proticin or on their susceptibility to proticin. Antibiotic susceptibility test was performed by standard disc diffusion method according to NCCLS. Proticin typing was made by the standard strain set from the B. W. Senior collection. Most (59%) strains belonged to ESBL producers and were more resistant to antibiotics than ESBL-negative strains. Predominant proticin patterns among the ESBL (+) strains were: P1,2(6)/SO (23%), P1,2/SO (13.5%). Among the ESBL-negative strains more frequent were P6/SO (16.6%), P1,2/SO (13.8%) and P3,6/SO (13.8%) proticin types.
