Administration of free muramyl tripeptide phosphatidylethanolamide (MTPPE) or liposome-encapsulated MTPPE (LE-MTPPE) in a twofold-lower dose at 24 h before bacterial inoculation resulted in clearance of intravenously inoculated Klebsiella pneumoniae by tissue macrophages, whereas in control mice, bacteria were not effectively cleared from the blood. In addition, MTPPE and LE-MTPPE led to increased numbers of leukocytes in the blood, which could compensate for the leukopenia in mice resulting from infection with K. pneumoniae. In an attempt to elucidate the relative contributions of the activation of tissue macrophages and the recruitment of leukocytes to the antibacterial resistance induced by MTPPE and LE-MTPPE, mice were infected intraperitoneally with K. pneumoniae. In these MTPPE- and LE-MTPPE treated mice, intraperitoneal influx of leukocytes and the phagocytic capacity of leukocytes were not higher than in untreated control mice. However, MTPPE- and LE-MTPPE-treated mice survived much longer; eventually 33% of the LE-MTPPE-treated mice survived, whereas all untreated control mice died as a result of bacterial septicemia. This prevention of early death appeared to be the result of an increased clearance of bacteria from the blood by activated tissue macrophages. It was observed that depletion of these tissue macrophages in liver and spleen abrogates the effect of LE-MTPPE treatment, indicating that tissue macrophages are of major importance in the LE-MTPPE-induced resistance against K. pneumoniae infection.
