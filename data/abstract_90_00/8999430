2-Hydroxymethyl-1-methyl-1H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine was obtained and its oxidation was carried out. 1-Methyl-1H-2-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridinecarboxylic acid, its methyl ester, amide, nitrile, thioamide, amidoxime, hydrazide and hydrazidehydrazones were synthesized. Willgerodt-Kindler reaction of 1,2-dimethyl-1H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine was investigated. Some of the obtained compounds were tested for antituberculotic activity.
