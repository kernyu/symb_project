OBJECTIVE: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (SM) is a gram-negative bacillus whose incidence like nosocomial pathogen has been incremented in the last years, especially in immunocompromised patients, subjected to invasive procedures and those receiving broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy. METHOD: We report 15 isolations of SM between 1994-1996. RESULTS: The criteria for SM infection were fulfilled by 9 patients (60%), and 6 patients (40%) were colonized. The mean age of the patient was 60 +/- 12 years. Major predisposing factors in infections included venous catheterization (100%), prior surgery (86%), residence in ICU (80%), prior antibiotic therapy (80%) and intubation (66%). The most common underlying disease were heart disease (60%), treatment with immunosuppressors and/or steroids (46%) and chronic lung disease (46%). Ten cases (66%) had polymicrobial culture. The mortality rate was 40%. Risk factors associated with fatal outcome included the following: chronic lung disease (p = 0.043), nasogastric catheterization (p = 0.01), urinary tract catheterization (p = 0.02), intubation (p = 0.04) and the presence of pneumonia or sepsis by SM (p = 0.02). The most active agents were colistina (100%), cotrimoxazol (71%) and ceftazidima (53%). The isolates were highly resistant to first and second-generation cephalosporins (100%) tetracyclines (86%), aztreonam (91%) and imipenem (71%). CONCLUSION: SM cause a wide range of clinical syndromes and is more likely to cause infection or colonization in patients who have underlying disease. Due to its inherent multiple-antimicrobial resistance, it would appear its potential as a nosocomial pathogen will continue to increase. Therapy of patients should include cotrimoxazole.
