Thalli of the haploid liverwort Marchantial polymorpha were successfully used for direct particle bombardment with plasmid pMT, which carries a hygromycin phosphotransferase gene (hpt) controlled by the CaMV 35S promoter and the NOS polyadenylation region. Hygromycin-resistant cell masses arose from the thallus surface and developed directly into hygromycin-resistant thalli. Southern blot analyses indicated that these thalli carried at least 1-4 copies of the hpt gene, which were stably transmitted to their asexual thallus progenies via gemma propagation for three generations. This transformation and direct plant regeneration protocol is expected to be a valuable tool for the molecular analysis of this lower land plant.
