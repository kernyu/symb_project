Even now 50% of the world population are still living in malaria endemic areas and every year 200 million new cases with 2 million deaths are reported. Most of the malaria deaths are children under 5 years old. Although malaria endemicity currently exists mainly in tropics, before the human started its efforts to eradicate malaria in large scale in 1950s, malaria was more widely distributed in the world. At this time Japan and malaria together with North America and European countries. However some areas were precluded from malaria endemicity: i.e., high mountains and deserts. Also Polynesian islands in the Pacific have never been malarious, even though Melanesian Papua New Guinea, Solomon, and Vanuatu are highly malarious even now. Human disease malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites and transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes. Human is classified into the malaria donor and recipient. The environment is supporting this system: for example, temperature and rainfall are important factors together with vegetation, or housing, health infrastructure, war situation, and poverty status. In 1950s, the WHO malaria eradication program focused its efforts on vector control, using DDT-residual spraying. But the program completely failed with mainly operational reasons and we already learned it is almost impossible to control malaria only killing mosquitoes. In 1992 the new Global Malaria Control Strategy adopted by Malaria Summit at Amsterdam says the primary objective is early diagnosis and treatment to prevent malaria death. In this context malaria chemotherapy is a key issue. Also we understand more and more the environmental management is very important. Malaria vaccine may be a conceptually important tool, but may be available soon.
