Thermodynamic-cycle perturbation theory and molecular dynamics simulations were used to calculate the difference in the free energy of binding of the antiviral compound WIN53338 to the wild-type human rhinovirus 14 and to a drug-resistant mutant of the virus in which valine 188 of the viral protein 1 is mutated to leucine. Because of the difficulty of achieving adequate sampling of all of the rotational isomers of amino acid side-chains in molecular dynamics simulations, an explicit treatment of the effects of the existence of multiple rotational isomers of residue 188 on the calculated free energies was used. The rotamers of residue 188 were first mapped by steric and energetic techniques as described in the accompanying article. Thermodynamic integration was then carried out during simulations of the virus, both with and without the antiviral compound bound, by mutating residue 188 while restraining its side-chain to one conformation. The contributions of the other rotamers of residue 188 to the free-energy changes for this mutation were then added to those calculated by thermodynamic integration as correction factors. Binding of WIN53338 to the wild-type virus was calculated to be favored over binding to the mutant virus by 1.7(+/- 3.0) kcal/mol. This is consistent with experimental data which, if differences in activity are assumed to be due to differences in binding, indicate that the binding affinity of WIN53338 for the wild-type virus is at least 0.15 to 1.7 kcal/mol greater than for the mutant virus. Thermodynamic integration was also performed in the conventional manner without restraints and was found to give less accurate results.
