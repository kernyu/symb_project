Salmonella Typhimurium isolates from feed ingredients or poultry sources isolated during 1995 to 1997 from different geographical locations within Minnesota were examined for the presence of Salmonella Typhimurium definitive type 104 (DT104). Antibiotic susceptibility studies indicated that 15 of 50 isolates of Salmonella Typhimurium had an antibiotic resistance pattern (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and tetracycline) that is usually observed with multidrug-resistant Salmonella Typhimurium DT104. Of the 15 isolates showing the antibiotic resistance pattern, 8 isolates were phage type 104, 3 isolates were typed as phage type 104 complex, and the remaining 4 isolates belonged to phage types 193, 81, and 126. DT104 was recovered from both feed ingredients and poultry samples. Of the seven feed ingredient-associated Salmonella Typhimurium isolates, four were DT104, whereas only 7 of 43 poultry-associated Salmonella Typhimurium isolates were DT104. A repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (rep-PCR) of 50 isolates of Salmonella Typhimurium representing 13 phage types identified seven distinct fingerprint profiles. No correlation between phage type and rep-PCR type was noticed. Eleven Salmonella Typhimurium isolates belonging to DT104 and its complex were grouped into two closely related rep-PCR types.
