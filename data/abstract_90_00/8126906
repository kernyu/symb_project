The most dominant species isolated from bacterial skin infection is always Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). The frequency of isolation of methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) has recently been increasing in skin infections. MRSA is resistant to many kinds of antibiotics, therefore, MRSA infections is incurable, in many cases. MRSA are isolated most often from infectious decubitus or leg ulcers, in compromised hosts. S. aureus is etiologically related to atopic dermatitis. Simultaneously with S. aureus, there is a increasing frequency of isolation of Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) in atopic dermatitis. S. pyogenes infections are much more severe because patients infected with S. pyogenes have fever and/or concurrent kidney disorders. In these skin disorders, there is severe skin damage or defect, so that, it may be very difficult to eradicate MRSA in decubitus, ulcers and S. pyogenes in atopic dermatitis.
