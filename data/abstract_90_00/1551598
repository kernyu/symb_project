The amplification product obtained with DNA from vancomycin-resistant (VmR) Enterococcus gallinarum BM4174 and a pair of degenerate oligodeoxyribonucleotides that correspond to conserved amino acid (aa) motifs in Escherichia coli D-alanine (D-Ala):D-Ala ligases and in En. faecium VmR protein (VanA) was used as a probe to clone the vanC gene of that strain. The vanC product, with a calculated Mr of 37,504, exhibits 29 to 38% aa identity with VanA and E. coli ligases. Insertional inactivation of vanC led to Vm sensitivity of BM4174 suggesting that the gene may encode a D-Ala:D-Ala ligase of altered specificity.
