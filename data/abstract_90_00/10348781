The polymerase (pol) coding sequence was determined for 40 independent clinical cytomegalovirus isolates sensitive to ganciclovir and foscarnet. Sequence alignments showed >98% interstrain homology and amino acid variation in only 4% of the 1, 237 codons. Almost all variation occurred outside of conserved functional domains where resistance mutations have been identified.
