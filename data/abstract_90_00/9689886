The risk factors for urinary tract infections in children are the young age, the severe febrile symptoms, any obstruction or dilatation of the urinary tract, recurrent episodes of acute disease and delay in initiating effective treatment. Today a new risk factor lies in the increasing resistance of germs to usually used antibiotics. The treatment therefore must be adapted to the local patterns of bacterial sensitives. To lower cost of the therapy, different ways may be followed: 1. To try to reduce the time of the inpatient management by using day-care or outpatient management possibilities. 2. To try to switch from the initial, heavy parenteral drugs to antibiotics to which the germ is sensitive and even to an adapted oral medication, when the child is doing well, is well hydrated and can tolerate the treatment. The outpatient management requires more compliance from the child and may be a burden for the parents.
