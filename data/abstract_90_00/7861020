Current therapy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is inadequate to control the progression of the disease. Although existing nucleoside analogues, such as zidovudine, have clear benefits, they also have drawbacks, including toxicity and the possibility of drug resistance. In addition, the timing of therapy and the use of monotherapy versus combination therapy as initial treatment have not been definitively established. HIV drugs currently in development include newer nucleoside analogues, such as stavudine and lamivudine, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and protease inhibitors. The addition of these agents to the antiretroviral armamentarium will expand the treatment options available to clinicians who treat patients with HIV infection.
