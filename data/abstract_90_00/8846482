Despite the urgent need of a new antimalarial drugs, particularly those against multiresistant falciparum malaria, only a limited number of drugs are now at an advanced stage of preclinical or clinical development. They include artemisinin derivatives, pyronaridine and benflumetol (all originally developed in China), as well as new antifolate combinations, the hydroxynaphoquinone atovaquone which has a novel mode of action, and a new 8-aminoquinoline which appears more active and less toxic than primaquine. Some of these drugs may become available in the next few years. It is therefore essential to find mechanisms to ensure that they are made available at an affordable price to the populations that really need them.
