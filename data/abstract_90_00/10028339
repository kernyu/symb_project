The Stichting Werkgroep Antibioticabeleid (SWAB, Foundation Antibiotics Policy Team) has issued guidelines for empirical antimicrobial therapy of adult patients with bronchitis in hospital. Acute bronchitis is rarely caused by bacteria: therefore antibiotic treatment is not indicated in most cases. In an exacerbation of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the primary treatment aims at combating the inflammatory reaction and the bronchospasm. In case of increasing dyspnoea, (increase of) sputum production and (increase of) purulence of the sputum, antibiotic treatment may lead to shortening of the symptoms and sickness duration. Doxycycline is to be preferred because of its spectrum, easy dosage and favourable price. If the patient has not had antibiotics earlier, amoxicillin also is a good choice. Macrolide antibiotics are no preparations of first choice because large-scale use readily leads to resistance.
