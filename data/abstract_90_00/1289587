Therapeutic effects of cefprozil (CFPZ, BMY-28100), a new cephalosporin, were examined in various infectious diseases in children. Clinical efficacy rates were 50% (2/4) in acute bronchitis, 80% (4/5) in pharyngitis, 0% in laryngitis, 100% (7/7) in tonsillitis, 100% (8/8) in impetigo contagiosa, furuncle and posthitis. Hence, the overall efficacy rate was 84% (21/25). Adverse effects were observed in 1 case with slightly elevated serum GOT and GPT. Changes in serum concentrations and urinary excretion of CFPZ were examined in 4 and 2 children without infection, respectively. T 1/2 values obtained were between 1 hour to 2 hours (bioassay). Six hour recovery rates in urine were 51.8% and 77.8% (bioassay). CFPZ was considered to be a safe and useful drug in treating various infectious diseases in children.
