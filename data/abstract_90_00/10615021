Recent evidence supports a role for cell death and inflammation as etiologic factors in neointimal formation and restenosis after angioplasty. This study was undertaken to examine the pattern and intensity of the proliferative response, cell death, and activation of inflammatory, endothelial and smooth muscle cells (SMC) in a model of intimal reinjury. Two ballooning injuries were performed to rat aorta, the second one 14 days after the first injury. Our results demonstrate that ballooning injury to pre-existing neointima differs clearly from an injury to a normal aorta. First, ballooning injury to pre-existing neointima doubled the proliferative response of SMC and intimal thickening, but proliferation of SMC occurred only in the intima, and did not extend into the media. Second, within four hours after the first injury, the number of TUNEL-positive SMC in the media increased from 3% to 23%, but no such increase was found in the pre-existing neointima after the second injury. Third, the prompt proliferative response of intimal SMC after the second injury was linked with a significant increase in endothelial P-selectin and neointimal VCAM-1 immunoreactivity, compared to the first injury at corresponding time points, followed by high numbers of activated ED3+ macrophages and CD4+ T cells in the developing neointima. A balance in injury-induced cell death and proliferation obviously maintains stable cell numbers observed in the media, whereas in the neointima, the resistance of SMC to injury-induced cell death may contribute to a rapid lesion formation in restenosis.
