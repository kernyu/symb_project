Erythromycin overcomes postvagotomy gastroparesia in patients without a distal stomach and functional pylorus. We investigate the role of the vagus in gastric emptying increased by erythromycin, using a model that preserves the physiology of the distal stomach and pylorus. The effects of erythromycin lactobionate (10 mg/kg) on transpyloric flow pattern and pyloric resistance were evaluated during repetitive bilateral vagal cooling in anesthetized pigs. Vagal cooling during erythromycin infusion produced a marked decreased of pyloric outflow (23 +/- 1.1 vs 50 +/- 2.6 ml/min) related to a reduced stroke volume of the flow pulses (7.8 +/- 3.31 vs. 14.1 +/- 2.44 ml). The amplitude and frequency of gastric and duodenal pressure events were unchanged or slightly reduced during vagal cooling. The smaller stroke volume of flow pulse was the consequence of increased pyloric resistance (6.2 +/- 1.98 vs. 2.3 +/- 0.21 mmHg.ml-1.s), which is associated with changes in the temporal relationship between a pyloric pressure event and flow pulse. In conclusion, erythromycin activity on the pylorus requires the integrity of vagal pathways. Enhancement of gastric outflow by erythromycin is also modulated by the vagus, since pyloric resistance was able to overcome increased gastric motility.
