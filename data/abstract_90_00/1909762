We conducted clinical studies on fleroxacin (FLRX), a new pyridone carboxylic acid derivative, for the treatment of periproctal abscess, secondary infections (due to wounds, burns or surgical operations), mastitis or areolitis and others with once daily dose of 200 mg or 300 mg. We obtained the following results. Clinical efficacy was evaluated in total 27 cases including periproctal abscess 11, secondary infection 8, mastitis or areolitis 6, phlegmon 1 and infected atheroma 1. Clinical efficacies were rated as excellent in 14, good in 9, fair in 4 cases. The overall efficacy rate was 85.2%. Bacteriological studies identified 14 strains of aerobic Gram-positive organisms, 12 of aerobic Gram-negative organisms and 6 of anaerobic organisms. The overall bacteriological efficacies were: eradicated in 26 strains, unchanged 2 and unidentified 4, hence the eradication rate was 92.9%. As for side effects, anorexia and nausea were observed in one of the 27 cases. In clinical laboratory tests, slight elevations of GPT and BUN were observed in 1 case each. We consider FLRX to be a useful antimicrobial agent at once daily dose for surgical infections.
