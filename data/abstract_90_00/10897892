To determine the mechanism of enteropathogenicity of the newly described Escherichia species, a total of 50 clinical isolates of Escherichia spp. from diarrhoeal stools were studied. Twelve isolates (24%) were found to be E. vulneris, 6 (12%) E. fergusonii, 2 (4%) E. hermannii, and the rest 30 (60%) were E. coli. Most isolates of the new species were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, and co-trimoxazole, but were susceptible to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. The representative strains of all the new species produced significant fluid accumulation in the rat ileal loops both by live cells and their culture filtrates. E. vulneris, isolated from stools, showed maximum fluid accumulation. Thus, it can be inferred that these species are diarrhoeagenic, but their roles on extra-intestinal infections remain to be determined.
