The freshwater ciliate Tetrahymena pyriformis is an ubiquitous organism that is present in all aquatic ecosystems. This protozoan showed a clear resistance against some polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which can be attributed to an efflux pump probably of the multidrug resistance (MDR) type. Immunocytochemical detection showed a positive stain of ciliate cells using the monoclonal antibodies 4E3, raised against P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The kinetics of P-gp expression were studied for control cultures and cultures treated with 15 microM benzo(a)pyrene. Western blot analysis using the Ab1, anti-P-gp polyclonal antibodies indicates the presence of two bands of 66 and 96 kDa of which the intensity increased with time in benzo(a)pyrene-treated ciliates. Uptake experiments with target compounds for the MDR pump, namely adriamycin, rhodamine 123 and two polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, benzo(a)pyrene and 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene, were carried out by flow cytometry, in the presence or absence of cyclosporin (an inhibitor of the multidrug resistant pump). The data indicate that the accumulation of these compounds by ciliate cells is significantly enhanced in the presence of cyclosporin. This suggests that Tetrahymena is provided with a P-gp-like system that is functionally active in a way similar to that of the mammalian P-gp.
