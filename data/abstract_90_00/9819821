Mycoplasma hominis and Acholeplasma laidlawii cultures resistant to antibacterial fluoroquinolone drugs ciprofloxacin (Cpf), ofloxacin (Ofl), and lomefloxacin (Lmf) were prepared by selection in liquid nutrient medium with ascending concentrations of Cpf. Resistant mycoplasma clones contained point mutations in the gyrase. A gene region determining quinolone resistance (QRDR gyrA): M. hominis contained C-->T transition resulting in substitution of Ser(83) for Leu and A. laidlawii G-->A resulting in substitution of Asp (91) for Asn. The phenomena of mutation formation during mycoplasma culturing in the presence of fluoroquinolones is studied. In the presence of Cpf in culture medium in concentrations of up to 10 micrograms/ml (for M. hominis) and 1 microgram/ml (for A. laidlawii) the mycoplasma populations contained cells with both altered and wild genotype. Culturing in the presence of higher Cpf concentrations resulted in elimination of cells nonmutant for QRDR gyrA. Besides in vitro studies, we analyzed clinical strains of M. hominis in the presence of different Cpf concentrations. M. hominis clones resistant to Cpf varying in genotypes were detected. These data permit a conclusion that the mechanism of fluoroquinolone resistance formation in mycoplasma includes several stages.
