A study was made of the epidemiology of gentamicin-resistant Gram-negative rods in a large general hospital over the last 12 years, and of the consequences of the presence of these bacteria for antibiotics policies, especially the use of gentamicin. Resistant bacteria were endemic at a low level: of the clinical isolates, 670 from 488 patients contained resistant bacteria, 2% of all Gram-negative rod isolates. Sporadically there were minor epidemics. Especially seriously ill, elderly patients became infected. Every year multiresistant bacteria contributed to a number of deaths. The choice of gentamicin as a drug of first, blind, choice in life-threatening infections remained justified. Continuous monitoring of Gram-negative rods is an important instrument for a preventive policy.
