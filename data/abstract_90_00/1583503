Thirty-eight men undergoing electroejaculation (EEJ) procedures for anejaculatory infertility were examined for the presence or absence of infection in urine and semen. In 29 spinal cord injury patients, a high incidence of infected urine and infected semen (41% and 56%, respectively) was seen, in contrast to patients with normal bladder function (0% and 11%). Urinary infection was associated with slightly lower sperm quality and lower pregnancy rates (10% vs 30% in the presence of sterile urine). Semen infection had no effect on sperm counts or pregnancy rates. If intermittent self-catheterization (ISC) was used to empty the neurogenic bladder, slightly better sperm quality was seen, the total failure rate was less, and much better pregnancy rates (44%) resulted than for patients using an alternative bladder management (7%). Antibiotics did not reduce the incidence of urine or semen infection, but did improve sperm counts slightly. Continuous prophylaxis was associated with bacterial resistance to many oral antibiotics and had no advantage over a short course of antibiotics prior to the procedure. Despite the above associations, the sperm quality in our patient population was never normal compared with that of men who ejaculate normally. We conclude that the low sperm quality seen in electroejaculation specimens from spinal cord injured males is not due entirely to infection or to the type of bladder management. Short courses of antibiotics, instead of continuous antibiotic prophylaxis, may be beneficial. Intermittent catheterization is superior to other methods of neurogenic bladder management in maintaining the fertility of spinal cord injured men.
