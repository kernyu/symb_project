Swiss mice infected with multidrug-resistant Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis were treated with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid stabilized with polylysine and carboxymethyl cellulose (Poly ICLC), a potent interferon (IFN) inducer and immune enhancer, in combination with chloroquine (CQ), which completely eliminated the malaria parasite from these animals. The enhancement of the antimalarial activity of poly ICLC was found to be completely reversed by the cytochrome P-450 inducer, phenobarbitone. No effect of Nw nitro-L-arginine (NLA), an inhibitor of nitric oxide, was seen on the enhancement of the antimalarial activity of CQ by Poly ICLC. These results suggest the possible involvement of cytochrome P-450 enzyme-mediated mechanism in the enhancement of the antimalarial activity of CQ by Poly ICLC.
