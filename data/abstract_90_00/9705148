Tet(O) mediates tetracycline resistance by protecting the ribosome from inhibition. A recombinant Tet(O) protein with a histidine tag was purified and its activity in protein synthesis characterized. Tetracycline inhibited the rate of poly(Phe) synthesis, producing short peptide chains. Tet(O)-His was able to restore the elongation rate and processivity. 70S ribosomes bound tetracycline with high affinity. Tet(O)-His in the presence of GTP, but not GDP or GMP, reduced the affinity of the ribosomes for tetracycline. Non-hydrolyzable GTP analogs in the presence of the factor were also able to interfere with tetracycline binding. Ribosomes increased the affinity of Tet(O)-His for GTPgammaS. Tet(O), 70S ribosomes and GTPgammaS formed a complex that could be isolated by gel filtration. The GTP conformer is the active form of Tet(O) that interacts with the ribosome. GTP binding is necessary for Tet(O) activity.
