Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection was identified in 11 dogs. The infection was associated with surgical treatment especially orthopaedic surgery. Infection after traumatic wounding, and recurrent pyoderma was also seen. Oral antibiotic treatment improved or resolved the infection in nine of the 11 dogs, although the methicillin-resistant isolates were susceptible to relatively few antibiotics.
