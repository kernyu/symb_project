Infective-stage larvae of trichostrongyle nematodes, either resistant or susceptible to thiabendazole (TBZ), were incubated in eserine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Paralysis occurred in larvae treated with eserine but significant differences were observed in the percentage of larva immobilized between TBZ-resistant and TBZ-susceptible strains of the nematodes. These differences are probably related to the presence of higher levels of acetylcholinesterase in the TBZ-resistant strains than in the susceptible strains. This could be used as a rapid and inexpensive method of detecting resistance to TBZ in trichostrongyles.
