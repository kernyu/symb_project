Twenty-two nitrogen-fixing Bacillus azotofixans strains were shown to produce an inhibition zone against themselves in plate assays. The B. azotofixans type strain P3L-5, chosen for further studies, produced inhibition zones against various Bacillus strains and other bacterial genera. This antibacterial substance was also produced in liquid medium and its production was enhanced in semisolid medium (0.4% agar) after 3 to 5 days of incubation. The substance was suggested to be an antibiotic and its preliminary characterization showed resistance to heat (100 degrees C, 15 minutes), to trypsin, pronase, deoxyribonuclease I, ribonuclease A, phospholipase C, ethanol, acetone, and ether, and sensitivity to strong alkali treatment. Its molecular weight was estimated to be between 3500 to 6000. After induction of B. azotofixans P3L-5 with mitomycin C or ultraviolet light, two types of particles were detected in the lysate: one similar to a phage tail and the other, less frequent, similar to a complete bacteriophage. Lysates containing these particles showed a killing effect in some but not all B. azotofixans strains, but neither the other Bacillus species nor Micrococcus were inhibited by these lysates.
