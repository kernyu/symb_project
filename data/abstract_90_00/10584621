Recent progress in antiretroviral treatment has led to dramatic improvements in HIV-related morbidity and mortality. These improvements have been fostered by advances in our understanding of HIV-related pathogenesis, the use of plasma HIV RNA levels to monitor patients, and the availability of 13 licensed antiretroviral drugs. Numerous drug combinations, especially those containing three or more agents, can suppress plasma HIV RNA levels below the lower limit of detection in the majority of treated patients. Urologists should be familiar with the limitations of this therapeutic response: patient adherence, drug resistance, a residual burden of chronically infected cells which are refractory to treatment, an unknown impact on HIV in genital secretions, and potential transmissibility through sexual contact.
