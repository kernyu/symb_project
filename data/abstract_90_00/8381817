The Oxyrase agar dilution method, with exclusion of CO2 from the environment, was compared with the reference agar dilution method recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (anaerobic chamber with 10% CO2) to test the susceptibility of 51 gram-negative and 43 gram-positive anaerobes to azithromycin and erythromycin. With the Oxyrase method, anaerobiosis was achieved by incorporation of the O2-binding enzyme Oxyrase in addition to susceptibility test medium, antibiotic, and enzyme substrates into the upper level of a biplate. Plates were covered with a Brewer lid and incubated in ambient air. With azithromycin, Oxyrase yielded an MIC for 50% of strains tested (MIC50) and MIC90 of 2.0 and 8.0 micrograms/ml, compared to 8.0 and > 32.0 micrograms/ml in standard anaerobic conditions. At a breakpoint of 8.0 micrograms/ml, 90.4% of strains were susceptible to azithromycin with Oxyrase, compared to 53.2% in the chamber. The corresponding erythromycin MIC50 and MIC90 were 1.0 and 8.0 micrograms/ml with Oxyrase, compared to 4.0 and > 32.0 micrograms/ml by the reference method, with 89.3% of strains susceptible at a breakpoint of 4 micrograms/ml with Oxyrase, compared to 60.6% in CO2. Exclusion of CO2 from the anaerobic atmosphere when testing for susceptibility to azalides and macrolides yielded lower MICs, which may lead to a reconsideration of the role played by these compounds in treatment of infections caused by these strains.
