Macrophages have been described to be important in determining the resistance of A/J mice or the susceptibility of BALB/c mice to the experimental infection with Mouse Hepatitis Virus 3 (MHV3). The interferon gamma (IFN gamma) activation of A/J and BALB/c mouse macrophages was shown to partially restrict the MHV3 replication only in macrophages from the resistant A/J mice. The activation by IFN gamma and/or infection with MHV3 showed that BALB/c mouse macrophages were capable of releasing tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), interleukin 1 (IL-1) and anion superoxide (O2-), and A/J mouse macrophages were capable of releasing TNF alpha and IL-1 but not O2-. Comparable amounts of TNF alpha or IL-1 were released by IFN gamma-activated A/J or BALB/c mouse macrophages. Following MHV3 infection or IFN gamma activation and MHV3 infection, BALB/c mouse macrophages were always capable of releasing higher amounts of TNF alpha, IL-1 or O2- than A/J mouse macrophages, which correlated with their susceptibility to the virus infection. The data indicate that the anti-MHV3 effect induced by IFN gamma in A/J mouse macrophages is not related to the studied extrinsic activities of these cells.
