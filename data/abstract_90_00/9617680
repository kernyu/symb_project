Many laboratories are likely to be or to become involved in screening patients for the carriage of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). A choice has to be made from the numerous formulations described and decisions made on the degree of vancomycin supplementation and the need for an enrichment phase. Few comparative trials and little critical evaluation has been performed to date and there is as yet no clear choice as to the optimal formulation. Laboratories must choose the formulation that most suits their particular requirements and circumstances.
