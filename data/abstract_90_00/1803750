A study of 30 patients suffering of acute pneumonia indicates that the development of acute pneumonia occurs against the background of disorders of the functional activity of monocytes with prevalent reduction of the functional activity of phagocytosis and inhibition of the unspecific cellular antiviral resistance. Leucocytic interferon sharply activates phagocytosis. The number of phagocytic cells and activity of phagocytosis reduced and the number of virus-involved immunocompetent cells increased under the effect of antibiotics.
