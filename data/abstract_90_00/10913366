Two Klebsiella pneumoniae strains selected according to their high cross-resistance pattern to cephalosporins were characterized by (i) outer membrane protein content such as OmpA or nonspecific porins, (ii) MICs of various cephalosporins and unrelated antibiotics, (iii) beta-lactamase production, and (iv) active efflux of fluoroquinolones. An association of porin deficiency and beta-lactamase production induced a noticeable cephalosporin resistance. In addition to these mechanisms, the presence of an active efflux participating in high-level fluoroquinolone resistance was identified in one strain. The decrease of antibiotic uptake associated with efflux explains the Klebsiella adaptation against the drugs present in the environment.
