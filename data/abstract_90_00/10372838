The prevention and treatment of the secondary hyperparathyroidism of chronic renal failure by medical means relies on a number of different possible approaches, which should be tailored to each patient's individual needs. Schematically, prevention should start early during the course of chronic renal failure (ie, when plasma intact parathyroid hormone is normal or only slightly elevated). Small calcium supplements prevent the development of a calcium deficit and may prevent parathyroid hormone oversecretion. The various therapeutic options that are available at present include: oral or intravenous vitamin D and vitamin D derivatives, in particular the 1alpha-hydroxylated vitamin D compounds; oral calcium supplements (calcium carbonate and calcium acetate) to avoid calcium depletion and also to bind phosphate in the intestinal lumen; aluminum-containing phosphate binders, the use of which should be restricted; oral magnesium salts (magnesium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide), which often are not well tolerated; general measures, such as dietary restriction of phosphate intake; and, in the case of resistance to all these approaches, the possibility of attempting ultrasound-guided ethanol injection of grossly hyperplastic parathyroid glands. Finally, it is encouraging to know that new drugs are in development, including calcium-free, aluminum-free, nonabsorbable oral phosphate binders, potentially nonhypercalcemic vitamin D derivatives, and calcimimetics. Some of them already have entered the stage of clinical evaluation, and preliminary results are promising.
