Fecal carriage of enterococci highly resistant to streptomycin, gentamicin, and kanamycin was examined in 64 healthy volunteers with no exposure to hospitals and in 53 hospitalized individuals. High-level resistance to streptomycin and gentamicin was found in fecal specimens from 3% and 0, respectively, of the healthy volunteers and in fecal specimens from 41% and 15%, respectively, of the hospitalized individuals. We found that high-level resistance to kanamycin was also more common among hospitalized individuals than among healthy volunteers (36% vs. 17%). The frequent occurrence of high-level resistance to kanamycin in fecal isolates confirms that amikacin is a poor choice when attempting to achieve synergistic therapy for enterococcal infections, in particular for those infections that are nosocomially acquired.
