Expression of pathogenesis-related protein 1a (PR-1a), a protein of unknown biochemical function, is induced to high levels in tobacco in response to pathogen infection. The induction of PR-1a expression is tightly correlated with the onset of systemic acquired resistance (SAR), a defense response effective against a variety of fungal, viral, and bacterial pathogens. While PR-1a has been postulated to be involved in SAR, and is the most highly expressed of the PR proteins, evidence for its role is lacking. In this report, we demonstrate that constitutive high-level expression of PR-1a in transgenic tobacco results in tolerance to infection by two oomycete pathogens, Peronospora tabacina and Phytophthora parasitica var. nicotianae.
