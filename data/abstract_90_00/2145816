The antimicrobial sensitivity of 96 strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, isolated in 1987-88 in Pikine, Senegal was determined. Twenty four percent of isolates produced beta-lactamase (PPNG). Among the beta-lactamase negative strains, 27% showed a decreased sensitivity to penicillin (MIC 0.125-0.25 mg/l) and 3% were resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 0.5 mg/l). Seventeen percent of isolates showed a decreased sensitivity to thiamphenicol (MIC 1-4 mg/l) and 7% were moderately resistant to tetracycline (MIC 2-4 mg/l). All isolates were sensitive to spectinomycin and sensitive to moderately sensitive to kanamycin. During an earlier survey performed in 1981, chromosomal resistance to tetracycline was not seen and only 4% of strains were beta-lactamase positive. These results suggest a decreasing antimicrobial sensitivity of N. gonorrhoeae in Pikine. Spectinomycin can be used as a first choice antimicrobial and thiamphenicol may be recommended as a valuable alternative treatment of gonorrhoea in Pikine, Senegal.
