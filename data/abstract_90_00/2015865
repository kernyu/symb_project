Transference of DNA to Entamoeba histolytica was carried out by polyethylene glycol fusion of two amebic clones with different phenotypes. Clone C9, strain HM1:IMSS, was the donor. It is emetine-resistant, highly phagocytic and virulent, and grows in soft agar. Clone L6, strain HM1:IMSS, the recipient, is emetine-sensitive, phagocytic, and virulence-deficient, and it does not grow in soft agar. Clones L6 and C9 have shown high stability in their virulence phenotypes since their isolation more than 5 years ago. Before fusion experiments, clone C9 was incubated in 20 micrograms/ml bromodeoxyuridine for 24 hr, and then, irradiated with 310 nm light to complete inactivation. Controls ensured that all irradiated trophozoites died after 24 hr of incubation at 37 degrees C. Irradiated C9 trophozoites were fused with L6 trophozoites, and hybrids were selected by their ability to grow in the presence of emetine. All hybrids, independently generated, grew poorly in soft agar and showed both an intermediate emetine-resistance and rate of phagocytosis. Some of them destroyed efficiently cell monolayers, but interestingly, they showed differences in their ability to produce hepatic abscesses in hamsters.
