Antibiotic sensitivity of 21 Campylobacter strains isolated from humans, monkeys and birds with diarrhea was assayed and the findings are presented. It was shown that all the isolates were highly sensitive to ofloxacin, pefloxacin, ciprofloxacin, josamycin, pipemidinic acid and amoxyclav (a combination of amoxycillin and clavulanic acid). The predominating majority of the strains were resistant to rifampicin, amoxycillin and phosphomycin. The majority of the cultures were sensitive to erythromycin and roxithromycin while some of the isolates were resistant to them which could be used as an additional biological characteristic of Campylobacter cultures and considered in choosing agents for antibiotic therapy.
