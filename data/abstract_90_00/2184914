Extensive research on nematodes of veterinary importance has resulted in new tests based on incubation of parasitic nematodes in culture media, with a variety of detection systems including visual observation, inhibition of aggregation, reduced secretion of acetylcholinesterase and electronic motility measurements. There has been a proliferation of tests to detect benzimidazole resistant nematodes including egg embryonation, egg hatch, larval motility, differences in esterases, and tubulin binding by labelled benzimidazoles. A simple larval development test, which detects resistance to all types of anthelmintics, is likely to become the preferred test for evaluation of resistance in nematodes of grazing animals. By contrast the relative unimportance of trematodes and cestodes from a commercial point of view has resulted in few recent developments in models for evaluating chemotherapy. But the emergence of drug resistant strains of both schistosomes and liver fluke indicates the need for simple tests to detect resistance.
