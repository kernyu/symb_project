Two monthly studies on the prevalence of penicillin and erythromycin susceptibility of Streptococcus pyogenes were performed in May and October of 1994 in Argentina. A total of 58 centers from 27 cities participated in these studies. A total of 1072 isolates were tested by a diffusion method, although 595 isolates were tested both by the diffusion and an agar dilution method (n = 1767 isolates). No penicillin-resistant streptococci were found in our study (MIC100 = 0.03 microgram/ml). Only four isolates were confirmed as erythromycin resistant S. pyogenes (prevalence 0.14 and 0.28% in May and October 1994, respectively). Resistance in three isolates was due to an inducible mechanism, although in one strain a different phenotype was observed.
