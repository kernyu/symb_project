Acute otitis media is the most common bacterial infection in pediatric patients. The predominant pathogens of acute otitis media are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Traditionally, amoxicillin has been the first-line therapeutic choice for patients with uncomplicated acute otitis media. However, with the increasing isolation of beta-lactamase-producing organisms and penicillin-resistant S pneumoniae, the frequency of amoxicillin treatment failures also appears to be increasing. Several issues should be considered when alternative antibiotics are selected to treat amoxicillin failures, such as the most likely pathogens with their susceptibility patterns, and antibiotic issues including clinical efficacy for specific pathogens, adverse reactions, palatability, dosing schedules, and cost. Consequently, enhanced beta-lactamase stability, activity against penicillin-resistant S pneumoniae, and once- or twice-daily dosing regimens must be considered when antibiotics are chosen for patients in whom amoxicillin therapy has failed.
