For the first time the experimental method of exogenous RNA has been used to evaluate the role of protein synthesis in different organs for the development of resistance to the soporific effect of barbiturates. Liver cytosolic RNA of phenobarbital-treated donors was found to reproduce completely the effect of phenobarbital-induced resistance to barbiturates in recipient rats: the reduction of hexenal-induced sleep and the increase of cytochrome P450 content in hepatic microsomes. Brain and renal RNAs had no influence on recipients. These data demonstrate the decisive role of microsomal R450-contained enzymes synthesis in the mechanism of the development of barbiturate resistance. It is concluded that exogenous RNA technique is of value for the organ-specific analysis of various complicated biological phenomena resulted from the activation of protein synthesis. The mechanism of exogenous RNA action and the possibility of cellular interactions by means of RNA molecules are also discussed.
