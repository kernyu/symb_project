Availability of arbekacin (ABK) was analyzed in the chemotherapy of 24 MRSA-infected patients with symptoms of pneumonia (12), sepsis (6) and others (6). Most patients had background diseases such as malignant tumors or cerebrovascular disorders. 47% (7/15) of them were immunologically abnormal. 17 of them had been previously treated with cephems, imipenem, minocycline or fosfomycin. The ABK therapy was performed with doses ranging 50-400 mg a day, divided into 1-3 times (mostly 100 mg x 2), and for 5-24 days. (18 patients were treated between 5 and 14 days). 14 patients (58%) received combined therapy with other antibiotics (mostly with beta-lactams, 12). The clinical efficacy rate of the ABK therapy was 62% (good, 13; fair, 4; ineffective, 4; unknown, 3). The bacteriological efficacies were: eradicated, 7 (44%); decreased, 4; no change, 5; unknown, 8. Side effects were found in 3 patients (oliguria, 2; eruption due to drug, 1) and one case resulted in serious renal disorder. Abnormal laboratory data were found in 7 cases. Above results have indicated that ABK is a useful antibiotic in chemotherapy of MRSA-infections.
