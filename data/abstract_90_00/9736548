GR135402, a sordarin derivative, was isolated in an antifungal screening program. GR135402, sordarin, and derivatives of both compounds were evaluated for their ability to inhibit cell-free translational systems from five different pathogenic fungi (Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida krusei, Candida parapsilosis, and Cryptococcus neoformans). The activity profile of GR135402 is extended to other chemical compounds derived from sordarin. Experimental results indicate that sordarin analogs exert their antifungal effects by specifically inhibiting the protein synthesis elongation cycle in yeasts but do not affect protein synthesis machinery in mammalian systems. Intrinsically resistant strains owe their resistance to differences in the molecular target of sordarins in these strains. Preliminary studies performed to elucidate the mode of action of this new class of antifungal agents have shown that the putative target of sordarins is one of the protein synthesis elongation factors.
