For the effective surveillance of antimicrobial drug resistance within Salmonella organisms from humans, harmonization of methods used for sensitivity testing by laboratories responsible for the typing of such organisms is essential. A study of resistance or sensitivity to a panel of 11 antimicrobials by the Enter-net international surveillance network was therefore undertaken. There are 18 national Salmonella reference laboratories within this European Union-funded network. Forty-eight strains of Salmonella enterica were distributed to each laboratory for testing for resistance or sensitivity to ampicillin, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, kanamycin, streptomycin, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, trimethoprim, nalidixic acid, and ciprofloxacin. Over 8,500 tests were assessed involving disk diffusion (DD), agar breakpoint (BP), or full minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Results indicated that whichever method was used, there was a high degree of concordance for the detection of resistance to most antimicrobials; only for decreased sensitivity to ciprofloxacin was there substantial nonconcordance. Because all isolates with decreased sensitivity to ciprofloxacin were resistant to nalidixic acid, it is suggested that, if required, MICs to ciprofloxacin could be determined for isolates resistant to nalidixic acid. For the detection of sensitivity, the main area of nonconcordance was in the detection of sensitivity to streptomycin. With the exception of decreased sensitivity to ciprofloxacin, we are confident that a database of antimicrobial susceptibilities can now be established and harmonized antibiogram data for Salmonella can now be exchanged for national Salmonella reference laboratories within the European Union.
