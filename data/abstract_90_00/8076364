We have investigated the effect of the ionophore nigericin (NIG) in multidrug resistant (MDR) cells, using intracellular accumulation of the fluorescent dye rhodamine 123 (R123). NIG increased the accumulation of R123 in half of the murine MDR RFLC3 population but not in the human MDR CEM/VLB 100 cells. Co-treatment of RFLC3 with NIG plus verapamil showed additive effect on the accumulation of R123. The increase in R123 accumulation observed in RFLC3 was not the consequence of a direct effect of NIG on P-glycoprotein and was accompanied by a redistribution of the dye throughout the cell and a high cytotoxicity, which prevents the use of NIG as a resistance modulating agent.
