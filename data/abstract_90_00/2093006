In vivo test for the susceptibility of Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine was carried out in 390 patients. Parasite density was analysed by calculating the mean of each day's parasite count and the value was expressed per microliters of blood. Majority of sensitive and resistant infections attained minimal values on day 4. Further more, this value provides a clear-cut, statistically significant difference between sensitive and RI cases (Z = 2.14, P less than 0.05) RII, RIII cases (Z = 3.86, P less than 0.001). It is proposed that assessment of sensitivity should be based on D-4 parasite density per microliters of blood considering D-0 as base i.e., (proportionate reduction of parasite density on D-4 as compared to that on D-0) utilising the present criterion. In endemic areas, where reinfection is possible, patency on D-14 will nearly always be due to resistance. It is therefore, suggested that a better, more economical and an epidemiologically viable result can be obtained by extension of in vivo test upto D-14.
