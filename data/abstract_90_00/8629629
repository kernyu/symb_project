This study was performed to determine the clinical and economic consequences of alternative strategies of preventing Staphylococcus aureus infection in chronic hemodialysis patients by use of intranasal mupirocin calcium to clear nasal carriage of S aureus. Decision analysis evaluated clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of three likely management strategies to address S aureus nasal carriage and prevent subsequent infection in chronic ambulatory hemodialysis patients: (1) screen for S aureus nasal carriage every 3 months and treat those with a positive test result with mupirocin calcium; (2) treat all patients weekly with mupirocin calcium; or (3) no prevention strategy, treat infection only. Rates of nasal carriage of S aureus, S aureus infection rates, proportion of infections attributable to nasal carriage, efficacy of mupirocin, natural history of infection, and patient management strategies were derived from the published literature and supplemented by a panel of experts. Actual payments for medical services were obtained from Medicare parts A and B. Incremental cost-effectiveness was calculated from the perspective of Medicare and subjected to sensitivity analyses. Assuming that 75% of S aureus infections are attributable to nasal carriage in hemodialysis patients, eliminating nasal carriage of S aureus with mupirocin calcium (with or without screening) markedly reduces the number of infections (45% to 55%) and also reduces health care expenditures relative to treating infections when they occur. Annual savings to Medicare are $784,000 to $1,117,000 per 1,000 hemodialysis patients, depending on the prevention strategy. Preventing S aureus infection by eradicating nasal carriage in chronic hemodialysis patients reduces morbidity while simultaneously reducing medical care costs. The decision to eliminate nasal carriage on a regular basis or use a screening test to guide antibiotic therapy is dependent on the tradeoff between improved short-term clinical and cost benefits and the potential for bacterial resistance that may arise from widespread use of mupirocin calcium.
