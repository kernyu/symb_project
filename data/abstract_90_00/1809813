Various studies have shown that as a result of selective decontamination of the digestive tract, the incidence of pneumonia in artificial ventilation caused by gram-negative bacteria is reduced; however, a few studies have pointed out that, at the same time, the rate of pneumonia caused by gram-positive bacteria is increased. Most investigators agree that mortality cannot be reduced. A few studies have demonstrated that simultaneous administration of cefotaxime is not necessary. Various recent reports indicate that under certain conditions selective decontamination of the digestive tract undoubtedly leads to the development of resistance to gram-negative bacteria and in particular, to oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, S. epidermidis, and enterococci. Multicenter, randomized, and prospective double-blind studies will have to investigate and establish definitively which antibiotics have to be applied in which patients in order to reduce the rate of pneumonia as well as mortality. In addition, these studies will have to determine the microbiological and hospital hygiene measures necessary to avoid the risk of resistance or colonization developing by certain agents. As long as this is not the case, broad, non-selective use of SDD is not justified, especially in intensive care units.
