The gyrA genes isolated from three ciprofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus carried codon 84 (serine----leucine) and/or codon 85 (serine----proline) mutations that were absent in pretreatment susceptible strains. These substitutions occur in a region of the gyrase A protein wherein directly analogous mutations of serine 83----leucine and alanine 84----proline in Escherichia coli confer quinolone resistance. Thus, DNA gyrase A subunit mutations are implicated in resistance to ciprofloxacin in S. aureus.
