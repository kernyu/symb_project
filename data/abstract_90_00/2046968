Bacterial adherence to biomaterials as an element of clinical relevance is a well-known factor in the pathogenesis of sepsis. Drainages, intravascular catheters, surgical prostheses and other devices are susceptible to bacterial colonization with clinical consequences. In the last few years attention has been paid to coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (S. epidermidis), mainly to some strains able to produce a highly adhesive polysaccharide substance, called glycocalix or slime. This promotes adherence either interbacterial either between bacteria and biologic tissues or synthetic materials acting as a pathogenetic factor in sepsis being able to increase bacterial resistance to phagocytes and antibiotics. Bacterial contamination of 40 abdominal drainage tubes in patients operated in elective and in emergency surgery for various pathology has been evaluated. Sonication of the tip of the drainage was utilized in order to promote the detachment of adherent colonies and its effectiveness was compared to that of microcentrifugation. Culture of 25 drainages (62.5%) showed no bacterial contamination; 7 drainages (17.5%) have proved to be colonized by S. epidermidis, in 4 cases the isolated strains were also methicillin-resistant, 2 of which slime-producing. Out of the 7 drainages colonized by S. epidermidis, 4 were removed from patients operated in emergency: none of the isolated strains was slime-producing. Six drainages (15%) were colonized by Gram+ bacteria (S. fecalis, P-sensible cocci, rods), 1 (2.5%) by E. coli and 1 (2.5%) by P. aeruginosa, S. epidermidis appears to be the chief contaminant of abdominal drainages, especially in emergency surgery; slime production has always been observed in methicillin-resistant strains: this confirms the hypothesis that slime production is typical of specialized, virulent strains.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
