Media for yeast identification tests were incorporated into the wells of a microtitre tray. The tests included fermentation and assimilation of carbohydrates, assimilation of nitrogen compounds, growth in vitamin-free medium, resistance to cycloheximide, and observations for cell morphology and sporulation. Results of tests conducted in the trays showed very good agreement with those obtained by conventional methods. Eighteen reference yeasts were correctly identified from tests conducted in the trays. The trays of media could be stored, and provided a convenient system for yeast identification.
