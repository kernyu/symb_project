We report the case of a neonate who developed ventriculitis following insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Corynebacterium xerosis was isolated from CSF and from the tip of the catheter after it was removed. The isolate was resistant to multiple antibiotics, but the infant responded to treatment with vancomycin.
