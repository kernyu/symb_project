The clinical presentation of malaria is, in most of cases, a malaria attack. It occurs in 90% of imported cases in France within 30 days after return of endemic area. Characteristic malaria paroxism have three stages: chills, high fever (> 39 degrees C) and sweating stage. In this typical form, parasitaemia is easily disclosed. With the increasing spread of chemoresistance P. falciparum strains, many patients experience non specific symptoms before the onset of paroxysm, often complaining of malaise, headaches, myalgias and anorexia. In some cases temperature did not exceed 38 degrees C and physical examination revealed sometimes liver or splenic enlargement. These atypical presentations can masquerade other diseases such as a viral illness. In those patients blood smears were often negative and malaria diagnosis is carried out only by QBC or parasight test. Treatment of malaria attack needs antimalarial drugs effective against chemoresistant P. falciparum strains. Mefloquine of halofantrine can be delivered with the respect of guidelines prescription, given major side effects observed with these drugs (neuropsychiatric disorders with mefloquine and cardiac arrhythmias with halofantrine). Oral quinine sulfate can be used when the above drugs are not allowed.
