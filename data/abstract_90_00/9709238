A chemical dehairing process was applied to artificially contaminated bovine hide to evaluate the effect on populations of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella Typhimurium, as well as other strains of E. coli, total coliforms, and aerobic plate counts (APC). Pieces of hide (4 cm2) were contaminated with bovine feces inoculated with both rifampicin-resistant E. coli O157:H7 and S. Typhimurium to yield a final count of each pathogen of ca. 5.0 log10 CFU/cm2, or with noninoculated feces which produced an approximate final APC of 6.0 log10 CFU/cm2 and a coliform and E. coli count of 5.0 log10 CFU/cm2. Counts of pathogens, APC, coliforms, and E. coli were conducted before and after applying the dehairing treatment. S. Typhimurium and E. coil O157:H7 populations were significantly reduced from initial numbers (5.1 to 5.3 log10 CFU/cm2) to levels below the detection limit of 0.5 log10 CFU/cm2 after chemical dehairing. APC, coliforms, and E. coli counts were also reduced significantly after dehairing, with reductions of 3.4 for APC, 3.9 for coliforms, and > 4.3 log10 CFU/cm2 for other E. coli strains. Since the hide is a major source of fecal contamination of beef carcass surfaces, chemical dehairing may be beneficial in reducing overall contamination of carcasses.
