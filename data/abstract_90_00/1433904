Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for major oral antibacterial agents for clinically isolated microbial strains from materials collected from outpatients with respiratory tract infections in 1988, 1989 and 1990, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) appeared to be responsible for community-acquired respiratory tract infections, but there also was a tendency showing that MRSA increased year by year. 2. A tendency was observed indicating that benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP) increased year by year. 3. Beta-lactamase-producing strains of Haemophilus influenzae were observed in a certain ratio, and also those of Branhamella catarrhalis were found in high ratios. 4. A tendency of increasing resistance of Klebsiella pneumoniae to new quinolones was observed. 5. It is of a great importance to evaluate methods of selecting primary choice antibiotic agents since increasing numbers of new oral antibacterial agents are becoming rapidly available.
