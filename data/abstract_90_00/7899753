Recent progress about the mycobacterial structures have been realized and two major structures have been concerned: the genome and the cell wall. From these acquired new knowledge several lines of clinical research and diagnosis application emerged. Cloning and sequencing of several mycobacterial genes led to the development of diagnostic tools (DNA probes, PCR, finger printings of indated mycobacterial strains) and the potential detection of multiding resistant strains of M. tuberculosis. Genetic manipulations involving various mycobacterial genes do open the way for more precise molecular approaches concerning virulence factors involved in the pathophysiological understanding of mycobacterial diseases. Comparative physico-chemical and ultra-structural analysis of the mycobacterial cell wall evoked a highly complexed cell wall structure, constituted of a double lipidic layer linked to the peptidoglycan (PG). The first layer is constituted of mycolic acids that are linked to the PG by arabinogalactan, and to the superficial layer by hydrophobic interactions of glycolipids. The superficial layer is constituted of amphiphatic glycolipids, having a lipidic banal pole and a polysaccharidic apical pole. The knowledge of the mycobacterial cell wall structure opened the way of: the development of immunological diagnostic tools, being now days in clinical evaluation phase, a better approach for host-bacteria relationship study at the cellular level (macrophage, lymphocytes), and the understanding of the mode of action of antimycobacterial drugs such as isoniazid and ethambutol.
