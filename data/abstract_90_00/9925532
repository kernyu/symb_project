A nationwide susceptibility surveillance of 1,113 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates was carried out and found the following percentages of resistance: cefuroxime, 46%; penicillin, 37%; macrolides, 33%; aminopenicillins, 24%; cefotaxime, 13%; and ceftriaxone, 8%. A significant (P < 0.05) seasonality pattern for beta-lactam antibiotics was observed. Resistance to macrolides was higher (P < 0.05) in middle-ear samples. Higher percentages of resistance to cefuroxime and macrolides were observed among penicillin-intermediate and -resistant strains, whereas high frequencies of resistance to aminopenicillins and expanded-spectrum cephalosporins were observed only among penicillin-resistant strains.
