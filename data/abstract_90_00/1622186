E1040 showed the most potent activity (MIC for 90% of strains, 6.25 micrograms/ml) among beta-lactams tested against 70 strains of imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Two strains showed high-level resistance to E1040; one strain produced a type II oxyiminocephalosporin-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase (group 3), and the other produced an enzyme similar to a type II penicillinase (OXA-1). Both beta-lactamases contributed to resistance to E1040.
