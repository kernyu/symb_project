Over the last 2 years, advances in many areas of HIV clinical research and data on the effectiveness of potent combination therapy have substantially influenced the overall perspective of long-term management of HIV disease. However, the progress against HIV also came as a result of the better understanding of HIV pathogenesis. Research work in basic science has contributed considerably to obtain a clearer picture of the mechanisms of HIV infection, mainly through the understanding of key steps in the dynamics and kinetics of viral replication in vivo. Molecular biology also revealed much about the mechanisms of HIV virulence and the emergence of drug resistance. This article will give a short overview of the most recent advances in the field.
