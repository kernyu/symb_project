The 20th century has been considered the antimicrobial era--whereas the 21st century may well represent the post-antimicrobial era. The reason for this dramatic change, should it come to pass, is the development of bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents. This emerging resistance is now challenging the clinical utility of many antimicrobial agents such that the chemotherapy of hospitalized patients with serious infections has been compromised. If the problem with resistance is to be successfully dealt with by clinicians, the mechanisms of such resistance must be known and understood. This paper thus reviews the most important mechanisms of resistance as well as some of the most important pathogens having these mechanisms. An understanding of these important microbial resistance mechanisms will help the clinician identify circumstances in which resistance may be a problem as well as evaluating the potential usefulness of an alternate antimicrobial agent against resistant microbes.
