The minimal inhibitory concentrations of piperacillin (PIP) or cefotaxime (CTX) alone or in combination with tazobactam (TAZ) were determined against 168 anaerobes. All the strains were inhibited by PIP + TAZ, but certain strains resistant to CTX + TAZ were found among B. fragilis, Eubacterium and Peptostreptococcus. The second investigations included 30 strains of Bacteroides fragilis. Concentrations of 2, 4 and 8 mg/l of TAZ and sulbactam (SUL) were combined with piperacillin or cefotaxime. The two beta-lactamase-inhibitors had similar activities when used at 2 or 4 mg/l, but at 8 mg/l TAZ was more active than SUL. All B. fragilis strains were inhibited by PIP + TAZ or PIP + SUL, whereas resistance was observed with CTX + SUL or CTX + TAZ. On the same strains the activities of 6 beta-lactams (PIP, mezlocillin, ticarcillin (TIC), CTX, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime) were determined in combination with either SUL 4 mg/l or TAZ 8 mg/l. Only PIP or TIC + SUL or TAZ were able to inhibit at least 90% of tested strains. No resistance could be detected with PIP + TAZ combination. As conclusion, the two inhibitors when combined with PIP or TIC offered greater activity against both Gram positive or negative anaerobes and PIP + TAZ remained the more potent combination.
