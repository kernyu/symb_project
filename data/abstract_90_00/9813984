Of the 43 Aeromonas spp. isolated from various clinical samples 94% isolates were Beta-lactamase producers. The isolates were tested for sensitivity by disc diffusion method which is commonly used in Pakistan. MIC was determined by using Epsilometer test (E-test) method. More than 80% isolates were sensitive to cephalosporins and quinolones. However, resistance to commonly used antibiotics was very high, 94% isolates were resistant to ampicillin which corresponds to the betalactamase production. More than 60% of the isolates were resistant to cotrimoxazole and 40% to chloramphenicol, hence quinolones and cephalosporins appear to be the drugs of choice for treating serious Aeromonas infections. The MIC range of Aeromonas was best for cefotaxime < 0.06 - 1.0 ug/ml. MIC 90 for cefotaxime was 0.50 ug/ml, for imipenem 0.25 ug/ml and for ciprofloxacin 2.0 ug/ml.
