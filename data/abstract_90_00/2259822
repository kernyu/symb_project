During 23 months, the authors analyzed 8122 records of cancer patients admitted to the National Institute of Cancer of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The rate of hospital infection was of 18.4 infection episodes per 100 admissions. Hospital infections were detected in 556 patients (57.7%) of the surgical department. The overall rate of purulence seen in 4194 surgeries was 10.1%, and among 2153 clean surgeries, the authors found 95 (4.4%) suppurated surgeries. The surgical wound (28.2%), the respiratory tract (19.2%), and the urinary tract (18.7%) were the major sites involved during infections episodes. Of the 319 ICU patients evaluated, 154 acquired infection after the first 72 hours, with a mortality rate of 48.7%. The hospital microbial flora was made-up mostly of gram-negative aerobic bacteria, with a high incidence of micro-organisms that resist to major antibiotics of hospital use. The percentage of positive results in blood culture tests requested was of 23.7%, with a predominance of gram-negative bacteria (50.9%) and a high percentage of gentamicin-resistant micro-organisms. Antibiotics of greater use in surgical interventions were amikacin, first generation cephalosporins, and chloramphenicol, whereas amikacin, carbenicillin, and first and third generation cephalosporins prevailed in nonsurgical treatments. The authors' experience and findings re-emphasize the need and the importance of a broad multidisciplinary understanding and suggest the need of strict action for an effective control and prevention in hospitals of developing countries.
