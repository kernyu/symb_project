Liver transplantation for endstage hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has been associated with survival inferior to that of liver transplantation in other chronic liver diseases due to HBV reinfection of the graft. Lamivudine is a new nucleoside analog with potent antiviral effects against hepatitis B. Our aim was to test its efficacy when used pre- and posttransplantation in HBV-DNA positive patients with endstage liver disease. Patients received oral lamivudine 100 mg daily both pretransplant and posttransplant. Viral serology, serum and tissue HBV-DNA and liver histology were assessed sequentially. Five consecutive patients with endstage hepatitis B were entered into the trial. Serum HBV-DNA was cleared pretransplant in all patients. Three of four transplanted patients cleared HBeAg and HBsAg postoperatively, whereas all four became negative for serum HBV-DNA (dot-blot and PCR). Liver biopsies were negative for HBV-DNA by PCR in 3 of 4 cases. Lymphocytes were negative for HBV-DNA by PCR in all cases. With follow-up of 3, 14, 16, and 26 months, two patients have normal liver enzymes and normal liver histology and two have developed recurrent hepatitis B. No significant side effects were seen. This pilot study shows that lamivudine can effectively inhibit hepatitis B virus in cirrhotic patients pretransplant and posttransplant. A lamivudine resistant mutant developed in two patients. Transplant recipients with actively replicating HBV related cirrhosis may achieve a good outcome after liver transplantation using lamivudine, but viral resistance is likely to be a significant problem.
