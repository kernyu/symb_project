The efficacy of netobimin against digestive tract strongyles and the small lungworm Muellerius capillaris was tested in a dairy goat herd. The drenches were given orally at the rate of 20 mg/kg of body weight once, 10 mg/kg on 2 successive days, or 7.5 mg/kg on 3 successive days. Fecal egg counts and larval counts were done 8 days before and on the day of drenching; further counts were performed on postdrenching days 8 and 18. Two goats were necropsied, 1 on postdrenching day 5 and 1 on day 10 in the group treated on 3 successive days. The fecal egg counts were reduced by 44 to 79% depending on dosage on postdrenching day 18; the remaining worms were Trichostrongylus colubriformis. The larval counts of M capillaris were reduced by 72 to 92%, depending on dose. The reduction was significant in all the treated groups, compared with that in the control group. The use of netobimin at the dosage of 10 mg/kg given on 2 successive days or 7.5 mg/kg given on 3 successive days might be recommended to treat goats infected with Muellerius spp and digestive tract strongyles.
