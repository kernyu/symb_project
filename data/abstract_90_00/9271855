Linenscin OC2 is an antibacterial substance produced by the orange cheese coryneform bacterium Brevibacterium linens OC2. It inhibits the growth of Gram-positive bacteria but it is inactive against Gram-negative bacteria. The intact outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria was shown to be an effective permeability barrier against linenscin OC2. At high dosage the effect of linenscin OC2 was bacteriolytic on Listeria innocua. Bacteriostasis was observed at low dosage and peptidoglycan biosynthesis was affected at an early step upstream of the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. Hemolytic activity of this substance on sheep erythrocytes suggested a common mode of action on prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. It also suggested that the cytoplasmic membrane might be the primary target of linenscin OC2.
