One hundred and eight strains of coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) isolated from different clinical specimens (sputum, urine, blood, various catheters etc.) were classified into 9 species of CNS with biochemical technique. Staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus saprophyticus accounted for the majority (66%). Drug susceptibility tests revealed that they were highly resistant to penicillin, oxacillin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, compound sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, cephazolin and ++ceftazidim but relatively sensitive to vancomycin, amikacin, gentamicin and rifapen. The MIC of oxacillin ranged from 0.125 mg/L to 128 mg/L. The MIC90 was 64 mg/L. It is suggested that vancomycin is the therapy of first choice in methicillin resistant CNS infection.
