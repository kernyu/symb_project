We found that epicatechin gallate, a constituent of an extract of tea leaves (green tea) markedly lowered the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of oxacillin and other beta-lactams, but not of other antibacterial agents tested, in strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The antibacterial action of epicatechin gallate plus oxacillin was a bactericidal one.
