Imipenem-cilastatin, with its broad spectrum of activity and relative safety, offers an excellent alternative for the treatment of many obstetric and gynecologic infections. In addition, the possibilities for intramuscular administration give clinicians additional treatment options. Because of the relatively high cost of imipenem-cilastatin, it should not be considered "first-line" therapy for most obstetric and gynecologic infections at present. Misuse and overuse of imipenem-cilastatin will result in the further development of resistant organisms, as has already been seen with many other antibiotics, and continued monitoring of susceptibility patterns is necessary.
