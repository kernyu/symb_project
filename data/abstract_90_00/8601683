After controlling an epidemic of vanB-type vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE), we contained a subsequent vanA E faecium outbreak by using prospective laboratory-based surveillance, placing patients with VRE in private rooms, requiring the use of both gowns and gloves by all personnel entering the patients' rooms, and conducting prevalence surveys of patients on affected wards.
