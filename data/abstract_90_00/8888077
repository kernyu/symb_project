Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are a major problem in numerous institutions in the United States. Most VRE are resistant to all available antimicrobial agents, resulting in serious therapeutic dilemmas. The resistance genes are transmitted on transposons, so the potential for dissemination to other species is significant. Risk factors associated with VRE infection and colonization are vancomycin and cephalosporin use, but numerous patient-related factors also contribute. Although resistant strains appear to arise from the patient's endogenous flora, VRE may be spread through direct contact with contaminated environmental surfaces and hands of caregivers. Published guidelines for preventing such spread suggest implementing infection-control practices and vancomycin restrictions. The ideal drug regimen for the treatment of VRE is unknown. Various drug combinations have been studied in the laboratory, but patient treatment data are scarce. There is an urgent need for new antimicrobial agents.
