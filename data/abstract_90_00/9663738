Ten new polyethylene prosthetic components (PEs), ethylene oxide (EtO)- and gamma-sterilized, were studied by means of infrared (IR) analysis in order to evaluate oxidation. Using attenuate total reflection infrared spectroscopy the authors demonstrate that all samples show surface oxidation, formed during processing and shaping, related to mechano-degradation. By means of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) microscopy and derivatization techniques, the EtO-sterilized PEs present different behaviour in comparison to the gamma-radiated. The former show low levels of depth oxidation that could be related to the degradation which occurred during preparation of slices for IR analysis. The gamma-sterilized PEs show higher oxidation levels, variable from sample to sample, on the surface and in the bulk. The authors demonstrate that oxidation is described both by carbonyl species distribution and by hydroperoxide concentration. The hydroperoxides could be responsible for oxidative PEs ageing in in vivo service. The different oxidation levels and distribution could depend on the conditions of gamma-sterilization, in particular on the rate of the dose absorbed, not previously reported for ready-to-implant PEs. Chain scission of gamma-radiated UHMWPE, estimated by IR analysis, results in reduction of molecular weight and consequently in less abrasive resistance. The scheme of UHMWPE oxidation due to gamma-sterilization demonstrates the inhomogeneous distribution of reactive species in PEs responsible for the unpredictable performance in vivo.
