IL-2Ralpha-deficient (IL-2Ralpha(-/-)) mice exhibit an impaired activation-induced cell death for T cells and develop abnormal T cell activation with age. In our study, we found that IL-2Ralpha(-/-) mice at the age of 5 wk contained an increased number of CD44(+)CD69(-)CD8(+) T cells in lymph nodes, which expressed a high intensity of IL-2Rbeta and vigorously proliferated in response to a high dose of IL-15 or IL-2. The T cells produced a large amount of IFN-gamma in response to IL-15 plus IL-12 in a TCR-independent bystander manner. When IL-2Ralpha(-/-) mice were inoculated i.p. with HSV type 2 (HSV-2) 186 strain, they showed resistance to the infection accompanied by an increased level of serum IL-15. The depletion of CD8(+) T cells by in vivo administration of anti-CD8 mAb rendered IL-2Ralpha(-/-) mice susceptible to HSV-2-induced lethality. These results suggest that memory-type CD8(+) T cells play a novel role in the protection against HSV-2 infection in IL-2Ralpha(-/-) mice.
