Changes in the amount of oligopeptide binding protein (OppA) in spontaneous kanamycin-resistant mutants of Escherichia coli were investigated. Among 20 colonies obtained from 10(8) cells cultured in the presence of 20 microgram of kanamycin/ml, 1 colony had no detectable OppA and 7 colonies were mutants with reduced amounts of OppA. Sensitivity of wild-type cells to kanamycin increased slightly by transformation of the oppA gene, but the sensitivity of the mutants increased greatly by the transformation. A mutant with no OppA was found to be a nonsense mutant of the oppA gene at amino acid position 166. In a mutant having a reduced level of OppA, the reduction was due to the decrease in OppA synthesis at the translational level. These mutants were also resistant to other aminoglycoside antibiotics, including streptomycin, neomycin, and isepamicin. Isepamicin uptake activities decreased greatly in these two kinds of mutants. The results support the proposition that aminoglycoside antibiotics are transported into cells by the oligopeptide transport system, and that transport is an important factor for spontaneous resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics.
