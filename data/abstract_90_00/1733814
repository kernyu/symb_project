The objectives of this study were 1) to evaluate glucose transport and its regulation by insulin in easily accessible human cells, 2) to investigate the glucose transporter isoforms involved, and 3) to establish whether a defect in glucose transport is associated with peripheral insulin resistance, which is common in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients. We measured 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake in circulating mononuclear cells from 23 nondiabetic adults, 16 adults with IDDM, and 10 children with IDDM. Circulating mononuclear cells were separated from whole blood by Ficoll gradients and incubated with +/- 1 nM insulin. 2-DG uptake was measured after incubation with [3H]2-DG and cell separation through corn oil-phthalate. Cytochalasin B-inhibitable 2-DG uptake (basal and insulin stimulated) was higher in control than in IDDM subjects (P less than 0.001). Insulin significantly increased 2-DG uptake or 3-O-methylglucose uptake in both groups. Basal and insulin-stimulated 2-DG uptake was similar for adults and children with IDDM and did not correlate with age or body mass index in any group or disease duration, insulin dosage, or HbA1c in IDDM. In separated monocytes and lymphocytes, 2-DG uptake increased in response to insulin only in the monocyte population. Insulin dose-response curves indicated maximal stimulation of hexose uptake at 1-2 nM insulin for both control and diabetic subjects and demonstrated a significant decrease in maximal insulin response in the latter. Immunoblotting with specific antibodies revealed that circulating mononuclear cells and separated monocytes express the GLUT1 but not the GLUT4 isoform of the glucose transporter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
