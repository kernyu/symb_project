Clinical application of heart transplantation goes beyond 28 years experience. Ischaemic heart diseases remain, with idiopathic cardiomyopathies, the main indications for cardiac transplant. A combination of haemodynamic, contractile and viability measurements may be useful to choose between transplant and coronary revascularization for the failing ischaemic ventricle. Advances in the detection of early rejection, improved organ preservation procedures, and the introduction of new immunosuppressive therapy protocols have produced dramatic results in heart transplantation. Late graft atherosclerosis remains a serious threat despite retransplantation and, in some cases, mechanical circulatory support.
