This article reports preliminary results from a pilot study started in 1986 on patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia treated for several months with low-dose arabinosylcytosine and 1(OH)D3. During treatment or at the time of relapse, a monoblastic component was frequently found. A high percentage of patients were P-170-positive. In 2 patients it was possible to show that blasts, previously P-170-negative, became positive after treatment. In these 2 patients, failure of clinical response to antileukemic therapy was associated with this phenotype. The addition of the revertant drug nicardipine to the previously inactive treatment induced a partial response. Thus, previously reported in vitro observations on the differentiating activity of vitamin D3 metabolites, possible induction of multidrug chemoresistance by differentiating agents and the revertant activity of the Ca++ antagonist nicardipine appear to be confirmed in vivo in the reported patients.
