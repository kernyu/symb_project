Malaria, occurring in 1 to 2% of unprotected travellers to sub-Saharian Africa, remains a real risk because of its potential severity. In Asia or Latin America, the risk appears to be much lower, and in some cases, prevention can be limited to measures to avoid mosquito bites. Chemoprophylaxis by chloroquine-proguanil, mefloquine or, less frequently cyclines, is efficacious but poor compliance and frequent adverse events limits its interest. No regimen is totally effective and malaria must be considered in any traveller coming back from an endemic area with fever, even still receiving an appropriate prophylaxis.
