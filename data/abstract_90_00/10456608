Although much progress has occurred in the fight to treat infection, resistant bacteria increasingly are becoming problematic. The minimum inhibitory concentration is easily determined, yet its definition, clinical application, and relevance are confusing. In addition, errors can occur during in vitro susceptibility testing. The mechanism of resistance for different organisms is discussed as are the pitfalls of susceptibility testing and the prescription of antimicrobial agents.
