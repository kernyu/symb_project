Now that Helicobacter pylori has been strongly implicated as a causative factor in peptic ulcer disease, the dictum "no acid--no ulcer" may no longer be valid. However, H pylori has proved difficult to eradicate, and the approach to treatment of peptic ulcer is undergoing changes. At present, a triple-drug combination of bismuth and antibiotics is advised, and cultures should be obtained before and after treatment to monitor its efficacy. Side effects include pseudomembranous colitis and drug resistance.
