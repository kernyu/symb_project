Forty-seven Bordetella pertussis isolates recovered from January 1985 to June 1997 at Primary Children's Medical Center were tested for erythromycin resistance. Agar dilution MICs were determined on Regan-Lowe agar. Forty-six isolates were found to be erythromycin susceptible (all MICs were less than or equal to 0.12 microg/ml). One isolate was found to be erythromycin resistant (MIC, 32 microg/ml). In addition, we compared Etest MIC results and disk diffusion zone diameter measurements, performed on commercially prepared Regan-Lowe agar, to the agar dilution MIC result. Etest MIC and/or disk diffusion testing on commercial Regan-Lowe agar appears to be an adequate method for erythromycin resistance screening of B. pertussis isolates.
