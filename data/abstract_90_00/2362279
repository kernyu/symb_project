The hydroxy metabolites of rimantadine (3-5) were synthesized and compared to amantadine (1) and rimantadine (2) for their ability to inhibit the replication of influenza viruses in vitro. All three metabolites were inhibitory to wild-type influenza A viruses (H3N2 and H1N1). In particular, 2-hydroxyrimantadine (3) showed similar activity to amantadine, but the 3- and 4-hydroxy metabolites (4 and 5, respectively), both of which are found in rimantadine-treated patients, showed only modest inhibitory activity. A rimantadine-resistant isolate of influenza A virus exhibited cross-resistance to amantadine and to each of the metabolites 3-5. None of the compounds were effective against influenza B virus.
