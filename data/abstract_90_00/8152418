A number of Solanum nigrum mutants resistant to the antibiotics spectinomycin, streptomycin and lincomycin have been isolated from regenerating leaf strips after mutagenesis with nitroso-methylurea. Selection of streptomycin- and spectinomycin-resistant mutants has been described earlier. Lincomycin-resistant mutants show resistance to higher levels of the antibiotic than used in the initial selection, and in the most resistant mutant (L17A1) maternal inheritance of the trait was demonstrated. The lincomycin-resistant mutant L17A1 and a streptomycin plus spectinomycin resistant double mutant (StSp1) were chosen for detailed molecular characterisation. Regions of the plastid DNA, within the genes encoding 16S and 23S rRNA and rps12 (3') were sequenced. For spectinomycin and lincomycin resistance, base changes identical to those in similar Nicotiana mutants were identified. Streptomycin resistance is associated with an A-->C change at codon 87 of rps12 (converting a lysine into a glutamine), three codons upstream from a mutation earlier reported for Nicotiana. This site has not previously been implicated in streptomycin resistance mutations of higher plants, but has been found in Escherichia coli. The value of these mutants for studies on plastid genetics is discussed.
