MS8209, an amphotericin B derivative blocking human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) entry after CD4 binding, neutralized the HIV-2 strains EHO and ROD10 but not ROD(CEM). In the V3 domain of gp120, ROD(CEM) differed from ROD10 at two positions (a threonine instead of an isoleucine at position 312 and an arginine instead of a glutamine at position 329), and drug resistance was conferred to HIV-1 by substitution of the ROD(CEM) V3 but not the ROD10 V3. V3 mutations may prevent the interaction of gp120 with MS8209 or modify the mechanism of virus entry, rendering it less accessible to neutralization.
