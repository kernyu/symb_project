The incidences of Schistosoma mansoni infection and reinfection were investigated in an endemic area of Brazil (Peri-Peri, State of Minas Gerais) where chemotherapy and snail control had been used for 13 years (1974-87). Two cohorts were followed: the first consisted of 584 individuals with no evidence of infection at entry (infection cohort), and the second comprised 296 individuals who were treated and did not eliminate eggs 8-12 months afterwards (reinfection cohort). The incidence of infection (per 100 person-years) decreased from 7.5 in 1974-77 to 3.6 in 1986-87, and that of reinfection from 21.3 in 1974-77 to 3.7 in 1986-87. Calendar period, age at risk, and sex were independently associated with both infection and reinfection, while a heavy S. mansoni egg count prior to treatment (> or = 500 epg (eggs per gram of stools)) was independently associated with reinfection. The geometric mean number of eggs after treatment among those reinfected (47 epg) was approximately half that among those infected for the first time (81.5 epg). Age at risk had the greatest effect on both infection and reinfection. The rate ratios of infection and reinfection were 3 to 6 times higher among individuals younger than 20 years than among those aged > or = 25 years, even after adjusting for confounders. This suggests the existence of a strong protective effect with increased age (because of biological and/or environmental factors) for both infection and reinfection.
