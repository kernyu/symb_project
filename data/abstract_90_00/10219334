BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURE: We retrospectively studied the type, severity, frequency, and outcome of febrile infectious complications in 217 cancer patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy (603 episodes) over a 10-year period in a single pediatric institution. RESULTS: A total of 48.8% of the episodes occurred in severely leukopenic patients (WBC < 1.0 x 10(9)/l, absolute neutrophil count < 500 x 10(6)/l). In the second half of the study period febrile episodes occurred at increased frequency. The number of patients with gram-positive isolates in blood cultures increased over the years, most frequently coagulase-negative staphylococci were found. Remarkably, gram-negative bacteria increasingly resistant to the administered first-line antibiotic regimen emerged, necessitating modifications of the antimicrobial strategy every 3 years. Furthermore, Clostridium difficile-associated enterocolitis posed a clinical problem at increasing frequency since 1993. As expected, the speed of leukocyte recovery within 5 days from the onset of a febrile complication had an influence on the outcome of these episodes. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid recovery of the WBC was associated with an excellent prognosis whereas persisting neutropenia was found to be a negative factor associated with fatal outcomes. The fatality rate of all febrile episodes (2.3%) remained the same throughout the study period despite the availability and wider use of recombinant hematopoietic growth factors since 1991.
