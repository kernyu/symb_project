A total of 57 strains of ampicillin-resistant and -susceptible enterococci representing 10 species and 23 strains of vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive bacteria (Leuconostoc and Pediococcus) were tested to determine their susceptibility to 43 antimicrobial agents by the reference broth microdilution method. The drug MICs for the ampicillin-resistant enterococci were generally similar to those of ampicillin-susceptible strains, that is, highly resistant to cephalosporins, moderately susceptible or resistant to quinolones, and susceptible to "glycopeptides." Some investigational quinolones (PD127391, sparfloxacin, WIN57273), minocycline, and rifampin were highly active. Vancomycin-resistant strains were usually resistant to other "glycopeptides," for which correlation coefficients of MICs ranged from 0.881 to 0.978, except ramoplanin (MICs, 0.008-0.5 micrograms/ml). Most isolates resistant to vancomycin were susceptible to the newer quinolones, penicillins, aminoglycosides, clindamycin, and erythromycin, but highly resistant to cephalosporins. Discrepancies between the MICs and MBCs for glycopeptides were noted (greater than or equal to 8-fold, MBC50/MIC50), but not for ramoplanin. The vancomycin disk test was in 96.1% absolute agreement by identifying resistant strains without contributing false-susceptible, very major error.
