The goal of the antibiotic policy in hospitals is a correct and restrictive use of antimicrobial agents. Guidelines on antibiotic use aim to improve the quality of care, to reduce costs and to prevent the emergence of (multi-)resistant microorganisms. Strategic options and methods to reach these objectives are published by consensus committees of scientific societies and health care organizations. The local guidelines must be based upon the universal principles of prophylactic, empiric and therapeutic use of antimicrobial agents but they also take into account the local epidemiology of infectious diseases, microbiology and resistance patterns as well as the local clinical experience. Our experience on how an antibiotic policy was developed and implemented in our large university hospital is described.
