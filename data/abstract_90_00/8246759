The susceptibility of four isolates of Schistosoma mansoni (BH, MAP, MPR-1 and K) to four multiple doses of anti-schistosomal agents (hycanthone, niridazole, oxamniquine, and praziquantel) were evaluated in infected female Swiss albino mice. These schistosomal isolates had been maintained in the laboratory without further drug pressure for 20 to 30 generations. Multiple dosage regimens were used for each drug against each isolate of S. mansoni to generate ED50 (effective dose 50%) values. Results demonstrated that the K isolate is resistant to niridazole, the MPR-1 isolate to oxamniquine, and the MAP isolate to both hycanthone and oxamniquine. The BH isolate was susceptible to all drugs and was used as the reference isolate. All isolates were susceptible to parziquantel. The significance of the difference in response of the MPR-1 and MAP isolates is discussed. These results confirm the resistance of these isolates of S. mansoni to three schistosomicides and demonstrate that the resistance of these isolates are stable over long periods of time without exposure to drugs.
