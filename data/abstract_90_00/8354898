Between 1985 and 1991, 39,000 cases of tuberculosis occurred in excess of those expected based on previous trends. Immigration from high-prevalence countries, coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and outbreaks in congregative facilities are most responsible for the increase. Coincident with the increase in tuberculosis, outbreaks of multidrug resistant (MDR) tuberculosis have occurred. Clinical and epidemiologic data support nosocomial transmission. MDR tuberculosis occurred late in the course of HIV infection and was refractory to treatment. Compounding the problems of rising incidence and increasing resistance was the sudden recognition of shortages of antituberculous drugs. The problems currently posed by tuberculosis require new approaches to diagnosis and rapid sensitivity testing as well as assuring an adequate supply of licensed drugs and development of new drugs. A number of steps have been taken by governmental agencies to assure that the challenge is met.
