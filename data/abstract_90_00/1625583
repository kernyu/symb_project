We have identified a new gene locus (nov) affecting the resistance of Escherichia coli K-12 to novobiocin. The gene also affects, although to a lesser extent, tolerance to another gyrase inhibitor coumermycin. Transductional and complementation analysis show that nov is located between att phi 80 and the osmZ (hns) genes at minute 27 of the E. coli K-12 genetic map. In standard laboratory strains of E. coli K-12 nov exists at least in two allelic forms.
