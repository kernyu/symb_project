239 patients with streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis completed treatment with phenoxymethyl penicillin 12.5 mg per kg body weight b.i.d. for 10 days. At examination after completing therapy, throat specimens from 53 patients (22%) yielded growth of group A streptococci of the same. T-type as the initial culture (bacterial treatment failure). 20 of these 53 (38%) had symptoms and signs of tonsillitis (clinical and bacterial treatment failure). 48 of the patients with bacterial failure were randomly allocated to phenoxymethyl penicillin or clindamycin in an open design; 22 of them received a second course of phenoxymethyl penicillin for 10 days and 26 were given clindamycin, 6.5 mg per kg body weight b.i.d. (children) or 300 mg t.i.d. (adults) for 10 days. After completing their treatment, 14 of 22 patients (64%) given phenoxymethyl penicillin harboured the same T-type as in the previous two cultures, while group A streptococci were not recovered from any of the 26 patients receiving clindamycin. In patients with clinical failure after phenoxymethyl penicillin treatment, a new course with this drug is not motivated. In that situation clindamycin seems to be an efficient choice.
