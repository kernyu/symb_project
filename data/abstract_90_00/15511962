This review of the antibiotic sensitivity pattern of Gardnerella vaginalis culture isolates shows that the drugs found sensitive to G. vaginalis cultures include the new antimicrobial agents- ciprofloxacin, cefuroxine and ceftazidine, and some older antibiotics- ceftriaxone, cloxacillin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol and metranidazole. Streptomycin and augmentin showed intermediate sensitivity while penicillin, ampicillin, tetracycline and gentamycin exhibited resistance to G. vaginalis isolates. Metronidazole is currently the first-line drug of choice for the treatment of G. vaginalis and its related infections because of its effectiveness not just against G. vaginalis but also against anaerobes. It can be administered orally, parenterally and intravaginally as gel or sponge. The advantages and drawbacks to the use of these G. vaginalis - sensitive drugs, and the place of alternative drugs in the management of G. vaginalis - associated infections are discussed.
