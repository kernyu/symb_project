NK Lymphocytes were first identified by their cytotoxic and cytolytic activity against tumor cells. However there is now increasing evidence that these cells are also mediators of natural resistance against viruses, fungi, protozoa and bacteria. The purpose of this review is to summarize the data on the antimicrobial activity of NK cells and to discuss the influence of corticoids and of other molecules interfering with innate resistance against pathogenic micro-organisms.
