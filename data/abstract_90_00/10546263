Experts in the management of otitis media and the Drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae Therapeutic Working Group were convened by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to respond to changes in antimicrobial susceptibility among pneumococci. The objective was to provide consensus recommendations for the management of acute otitis media (AOM) and for the surveillance of drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. After summarizing published and unpublished data from the scientific literature and the experience of the panel members, the group concluded that oral amoxicillin should remain the first-line antimicrobial agent for treating AOM. For patients with clinically defined treatment failure after 3 days of therapy, useful alternative agents include amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime axetil, and intramuscular ceftriaxone. The group also made recommendations to improve surveillance and to obtain antimicrobial susceptibility patterns for local geographic areas.
