The sensitivity of human breast and lung cancer cell lines to TGF-alpha-PE40, a novel chimeric recombinant cytotoxin composed of two independent domains, (i) TGF-alpha and (ii) a 40 kDa segment of the Pseudomonas exotoxin protein, PE-40, was investigated. Toxicity varied widely, correlated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) levels (P = 0.01) and was greatly reduced by EGF, indicating that binding of TGF-alpha-PE40 to EGFR is important in mediating toxicity. Cell lines expressing low EGFR levels were most highly protected by EGF, indicating that normal (low EGFR-expressing) tissue may be selectively protected by EGF in vivo. P-glycoprotein did not confer resistance to TGF-alpha-PE40, and toxicity was unaffected by multidrug resistance-modulating agents (cyclosporin A, tamoxifen, verapamil), indicating a role for TGF-alpha-PE40 in the clinical management of drug-resistant tumours.
