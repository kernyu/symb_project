Thousand and six hundred ninety two fecal samples from children of few weeks old up to over ten years were tested for the presence of Clostridium difficile. Most of them were treated with antibiotics and showed diarrhea symptoms. Hundred and twenty three strains of C-difficile were submitted to serological typing and their sensitivity to 10 selected antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents was determined. Among 109 strains of C. difficile tested for enterotoxin production by latex test 82 strains (75.2%) were positive. Almost half (48%) of the isolated strains belonged to serotype C. Most of the strains were resistant to cefoxitin (88%) and clindamycin (76%). Over 90% of strains were sensitive to vancomycin and azlocillin and 86% to chloramphenicol and metronidazole. In the majority of patients with positive C. difficile cultures diarrhea was present, however, it was difficult to find a direct link between these symptoms and antibiotic therapy.
