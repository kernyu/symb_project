For the first national surveillance of antibiotic resistance in Taiwan, we collected in 1998 from 22 hospitals (6 medical centers, 15 regional hospitals, and 1 local hospital) 3,211 isolates in all parts of the country. Besides 50 random successive isolates from inpatients, each hospital was requested to collect 25 isolates each from positive blood cultures, hospital-acquired infections, outpatients and the pediatric department. We re-speciated all the submitted specimens and determined their antibiotic susceptibility patterns. The most common isolates were Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae), Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Among hospital-acquired infections, Acinetobacter spp. were among those which accounted for over 10% of the isolates. The oxacillin resistance of S. aureus was 82% in isolates from hospital-acquired infections, and 40% from outpatients. Among Enterococcus spp., 85% were either E. faecalis or E. faecium. They were 14% resistant to vancomycin. Among gram-negative bacteria, K. pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumanii were hospital-acquired isolates that were most clearly more resistant than community acquired isolates. This difference was less apparent in the case of Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and P. aeruginosa. These bacteria were generally more resistant from all sources. Fifty-one percent of Salmonella were resistant to ampicillin; however, these were all sensitive to ciprofloxacin. Isolates from the East were least resistant. Plotting the disc zone diameters of antibiotics within the susceptible range, we identified subpopulations with smaller diameters in the case of vancomycin against S. aureus, ciprofloxacin against E. coli, and ciprofloxacin against Salmonella spp. These findings represent one of the purposes of this surveillance as they may portend developing resistances which bear careful watching in the future.
