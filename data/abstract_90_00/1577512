S. typhi was isolated from 241 patients of pyrexia between July 1990 and March 1991. Multiple drug resistance was observed in 220 (91.3%) strains, the commonest pattern of drug resistance being ACCoT (49.4%). Predominance of phage type E1 in 196 (81.3%) strains and biotype I in 225 (93.4%) strains was observed. All ACCoT strains belonged to phage type E1 and all strains of phage type E1 belonged to biotype I.
