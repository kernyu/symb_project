Bacterial infections have been a major cause of concern in the recent years due to the emergence of drug resistance strains and inability of the current therapeutic regimens to treat these infections in certain cases. Beta-Lactam antibiotics have been drugs of choice since the introduction of penicillin. These drugs inhibit bacterial cell-wall-synthesizing enzymes, the so-called penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) selectively, thus providing an effective strategy for treatment of the bacterial infections. Significantly, bacteria have developed resistance mechanisms to neutralize the antibiotic action of beta-lactam drugs. Beta-Lactamases are enzymes that hydrolyze the beta-lactam moiety of these drugs, rendering them inactive. This is the primary mechanism of resistance to this class of antibiotics. There are 255 known beta-lactamases to date and the continued use of beta-lactams may select for newer variants yet. A discussion of the roles of these enzymes in the manifestation of the drug-resistant phenotype and their implications for pathogenecity of clinical strains of bacteria is presented.
