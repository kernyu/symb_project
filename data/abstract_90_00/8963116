The sensitivity of 59 Salmonella strains isolated in children with acute diarrhoea was tested against the new quinolones like: Ciproflaxicin (CIP), Norfloxacin (NOR) and Ofloxacin (OFX), as compared to the sensitivity against same aminosides: Gentamicin (GM), Amikacin (AN) against cephalosporins: Ceftazidime (CAZ), Cefalotine (CF) and other currently used antimicrobial agents: Tetraciclin (T), Ampicilin (A), Cloramfenicol (C), Furazolidon (FU). The majority of the studied Salmonella strains, 43 out of 59 strains, belonged to the serotype typhimurium, the most frequently serotype isolated in our geographical area. A very high percentage of Salmonella strains were sensitive against the three quinolones: 98,30% sensitive against NOR, 91,5% sensitive against OFX, 91,50% sensitive against CIP and 96,6% sensitive against AN. In contrast, the Salmonella strains sensitivity was lower in the other tested antimicrobial substances: C (32,2% sensitive strains), GM (8,5%), A (16,9%), CF (11,9%), T (3,4%), FU (1,7%). Out of 59 strains, 45 where resistant to more than four antibiotics, the most often observed pattern was: A, CAZ, CF, GM, T, C, FU.
