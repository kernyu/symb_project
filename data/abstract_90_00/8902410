A total of 152 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae from diverse geographic areas in the United States and with different levels of penicillin resistance were tested against five broad-spectrum cephalosporins, ampicillin, piperacillin, ticarcillin, and three beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations. Also, the effect of human serum proteins on the activity of selected "third-generation" cephalosporins was examined. The overall rank order of activity among the cephalosporins against penicillin-susceptible strains was: ceftriaxone (MIC90, 0.03 microgram/mL) > cefotaxime > ceftizoxime = cefuroxime > ceftazidime (MIC90, 0.5 microgram/mL). Only cefotaxime and ceftriaxone exhibited significant activity against penicillin-intermediate or -resistant isolates. Ampicillin, piperacillin, and penicillin were generally eight- to 16-fold more potent than ticarcillin and no increase in the effectiveness of these agents was observed with the addition of the beta-lactamase inhibitors (clavulanate, sulbactam, tazobactam). Ceftriaxone potency was significantly decreased (> or = four-fold) by the modest addition of 25% pooled human serum proteins and this change modified the rank order of potency against nonpenicillin-susceptible pneumococci to favor cefotaxime (41% resistant versus 71% for ceftriaxone; MICs at > or = 2 micrograms/mL). Induced high-level capsular production had no measurable effect on the MIC results of tested agents. These results confirm the continued activity advantages of cefotaxime and ceftriaxone against various populations of pneumococci compared to other alternative beta-lactams. The predictive value, however, of the utilized breakpoint concentrations of the cephalosporins, remains in question for pneumococcal infections other than those in the central nervous system and at unaltered, "usual" dosing.
