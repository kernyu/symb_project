Highly-pathogenic, mouse-passaged Naegleria fowleri amoebae are complement resistant. The present study evaluates the effect of complement on N. fowleri and the virulence of the amoebae after animal passage and growth in two different axenic media. Pathogenic N. fowleri maintained in "enriched" Cline medium are virulent for mice and resistant to complement lysis. A rapid decline in resistance to complement and virulence for mice is observed when highly-pathogenic N. fowleri are grown in Nelson medium lacking hemin. N. fowleri maintained in Nelson medium can be rendered complement-resistant by shifting the amoebae to growth in Cline medium for 2 h prior to the addition of complement. Cycloheximide treatment of N. fowleri maintained in Nelson medium blocks the transition to a complement-resistant phenotype following a shift in growth medium. Proteins were radiolabeled with [35S] during a shift from Nelson to Cline medium to identify specific polypeptides which may be associated with the functional activities related to virulence and resistance to complement.
