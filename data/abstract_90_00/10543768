The contribution of the dosage of target enzyme P-450 14alpha-demethylase (14alphaDM) to fluconazole resistance in both Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae remains unclear. Here, we show that overexpression of Saccharomyces P-450 14alphaDM in S. cerevisiae, under the control of the regulatable promoter GAL1, results in azole resistance.
