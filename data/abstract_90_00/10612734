The presence of antibiotic resistance gene cassettes in class I integrons was investigated in 24 sulfamethoxazole-resistant and -sensitive Acinetobacter isolates derived from two Danish freshwater trout farms. Integrons were detected in five isolates from one of the fish farms, and their inserts were characterised by DNA sequencing. Each isolate contained a dhfrI gene cassette encoding resistance to trimethoprim and an open reading frame orfC of unknown function identical to the content of an integron previously found in a clinical enterobacterial isolate. Among the five isolates, at least two different strains were differentiated based on phenotypic tests and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first report and characterisation of an integron in environmental bacteria.
