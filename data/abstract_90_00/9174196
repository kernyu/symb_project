Although there are an increasing number of new antifungal agents available, the morbidity and mortality due to invasive mycoses remain high. The high rates of polyene toxicities and the development of azole resistance have raised the issue of using antifungal agents of these classes in combination, despite theoretical concerns regarding antagonism between such agents. This study was designed to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of combined therapy with amphotericin B and fluconazole against Candida albicans. Two distinct animal models were used in this study: a neutropenic-mouse model of hematogenously disseminated candidiasis and the infective-endocarditis rabbit model. Treatment efficacy was assessed by determining reductions in mortality as well as decreases in tissue fungal densities. In the neutropenic-mouse model, amphotericin B, as well as combination therapy, significantly prolonged survival compared to untreated controls (P < 10(-5) and P = 0.001, respectively). The fungal densities in the kidneys of neutropenic mice were significantly reduced with either amphotericin B monotherapy or amphotericin B-fluconazole combined therapy compared to those of controls (P < 10(-6)). Fluconazole monotherapy also reduced fungal densities in the kidneys; however, this decrease was not statistically significant (P = 0.17). In contrast, treatment with either fluconazole alone or combined with amphotericin B (but not amphotericin B monotherapy) significantly decreased fungal densities in the brain (P = 0.025). In the rabbit endocarditis model, amphotericin B monotherapy or combined therapy significantly decreased fungal densities in cardiac vegetations (P < 0.01 versus the controls). Although no significant antagonism was seen when fluconazole was given in combination with amphotericin B, combination therapy did not augment the antifungal activity of amphotericin B.
