Rifampin susceptibility of 32 rifampin-resistant and 26 rifampin-susceptible Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains was analyzed by PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and DNA sequencing within the 157-bp region of the rpoB gene (Ala500 to Val550). Two false-positive PCR-SSCP results were observed among the susceptible strains due to the silent mutation Gln513 (CAA-->CAG) and the deletion mutation Thr508 and Ser509. Another silent mutation [Leu511 (CTG-->CTA)], combined with the mutation Ser531-->Leu, was observed in a resistant strain. These results suggest that to rule out false-positive PCR-SSCP results, sequencing of the target DNA is required.
