Mupirocin is a novel antibiotic totally unrelated in chemical structure and mode of action to any other clinically useful class of antibiotics. It has greatest antibacterial activity against aerobic gram-positive cocci, namely, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and other beta-hemolytic streptococci. Bactroban ointment is formulated as 2% mupirocin in polyethylene glycol ointment. No systemic absorption of mupirocin or its major metabolite, monic acid, has been detected in short courses of topical administration to healthy volunteers or to patients with epidermolysis bullosa after prolonged courses of therapy with Bactroban ointment. Randomized, multicenter, double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trials have shown that mupirocin is safe and effective for the treatment of impetigo.
