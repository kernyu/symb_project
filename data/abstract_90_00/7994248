We report a case of cyclosporin- and methylprednisolone-resistant intestinal acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation which responded to a new immunosuppressant, 15-deoxyspergualin (DSG). Endoscopy showed lymphoid hyperplasia with CD3+, CD4+, CD8- lymphocyte infiltration into the submucosa of the jejunum and colon. DSG effectively suppressed this intestinal acute GVHD.
