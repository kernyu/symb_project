Over a period of three years, the frequency of the appearance of methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (MRSA) was observed on a surgical intensive care unit. During this above-mentioned period of investigation it came to a heaped occurrence of nosocomial infections on this ICU with altogether 332 S. aureus-stems being isolated from different patient specimen. 204 (61.5%) of these were resistant against methicillin and could be divided into 48 first- and 156 follow-up-isolates. The thereupon accomplished differentiation of the 48 MRSA-first isolates by means of lysotyping and the pioneered GenePath Strain Typing System for a standardized pulsed-field-gel-electrophoresis (PFGE) gave the proof of 7 different MRSA-types. Around 7 different, in part parallel chains of infection on this ICU were observed, which could be led back to different strains. In reference to all analyzed S. aureus, an especially high rate (90%) of MRSA on this ICU could be isolated in taken wound-swabs, followed by 83.3% MRSA at catheter tips and 71,9% in tracheal and bronchial secretion. A consideration of the antibiotic susceptibility yielded, that also gentamicin and the quinolones showed an in-vitro resistance against MRSA, while fosfomycin, fusidic acid, chloramphenicol and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole reached positive responding rates between 80 and 100%. On the other hand, presently still 100% of the explored MRSA-strains are susceptible for glycopeptides such as vancomycin and teicoplanin. Because of intensive hospital hygienic measures the number of newly isolated MRSA could be reduced clearly on this ward.
