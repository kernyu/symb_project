This study which aimed to determine the susceptibility patterns of seven often prescribed antimicrobial agents for treatment of gonorrhoea in Kumasi, Ghana, over a study period of 3 years (1991 through 1993), examined a total of 1187 specimens (high vaginal, cervical and urethral). Identification of N. gonorrhoeae was by colonial morphology, oxidase test, sugar fermentation test and the Gram-stain. The Intra-lactam strip method was used to determine which Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates were beta lactamase producers (PPNG). Of the 1115 PPNG strains encountered, 300 were selected for MIC determination against seven (penicillin, cotrimoxazole, tetracycline erythromycin, spectinomycin, norfloxacin and ceftriaxone) antimicrobial agents in current usage in Kumasi, Ghana. Based on our results it was concluded, that PPNG strains are rampant/endemic in Kumasi, Ghana and that most exhibited multiple antimicrobial resistance. This situation requires, therefore, a serious review of the current Ghana Ministry of Health gonorrhoea treatment regimen. Suggestions to this end have been made.
