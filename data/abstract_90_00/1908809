Sequencing upstream from the vanA gene of enterococcal plasmid pIP816 that confers Vm resistance revealed the presence of an ORF which could code for a protein of 322 aa designated VanH. Extensive aa similarity was detected between VanH and 2-hydroxycarboxylic acid dehydrogenase. We discuss possible roles for VanH in the synthesis of a novel type of peptidoglycan precursors with lower affinity for Vm.
