Thirty-nine dogs with severe and/or recurrent lesions of pyoderma were treated with marbofloxacin at an average dosage of 2.12 mg/kg bodyweight, once daily, for time periods varing from 10 to 213 days. Forty-seven strains of bacteria, isolated from 34 cultures, were tested for sensitivity to various antibiotics. At day 0, no resistance to marbofloxacin was found, but one refractory case, a strain of Staphylococcus intermedius resistant to marbofloxacin, was cultured at day 28. Thirty-three dogs (84.6 per cent) showed an excellent response (cure), one (2.6 per cent) a clear improvement and one (2.6 per cent) a smaller improvement, while the remaining four dogs showed no response after 11 to 60 days. Fifteen dogs (45.5 per cent) relapsed over the follow-up period of three to 191 days, but none of the dogs in the study exhibited any adverse effects.
