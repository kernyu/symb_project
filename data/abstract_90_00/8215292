The susceptibility patterns of group A streptococci over the last 6 years in our hospital were determined. Since our last study, carried out in 1987, all isolates have remained very susceptible in vitro to penicillin and all of the other beta-lactam agents tested. We observed resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, and ofloxacin. The prevalence of erythromycin-resistant group A streptococci did not change appreciably throughout the study period.
