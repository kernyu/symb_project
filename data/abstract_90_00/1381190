Activity of the interferon-induced enzyme 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase (2-5 OAS) was measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and serum of patients with chronic phase Ph'-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) treated with interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) (4 x 10(6) IU/m2) alone or in combination with 50 micrograms IFN-gamma. At the beginning of IFN therapy, marked elevation of 2-5 OAS titers was detected in PBMCs (pretreatment 0.03-1.62, median 0.2; during treatment 0.8-13.14, median 4.31; 22 patients studied) and in serum (pretreatment 21-156 pmol/dl, median 62; during treatment 532-1740 pmol/dl, median 800; eight patients studied). However, 2-5 OAS titers were not related to clinical outcome or IFN therapy and also during IFN resistance elevated 2-5 OAS activity in PBMCs (median 3.45; range 1.05-13.14; 11 patients studied) were detected. These data argue against direct involvement of the 2-5 OAS system in the therapeutic effect of IFN in CML. However, 2-5 OAS titers in PBMCs or serum appear to be a reliable control of biologically active IFN therapy.
