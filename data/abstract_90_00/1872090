The capacity of the bacteriocin-like factor of tomicid being adsorbed on microbial cells, depending on the sensitivity of test microorganisms to the preparation, its form and concentration, the duration of the contact of microbial cells with tomicid, the temperature and pH of the incubation medium, was studied. The bacteriocin-like factor of tomicid was found to be capable of nonspecific sorption on microbial cells (in an amount of 64-128 units per mg of dried cell mass). The decrease of the temperature of the incubation medium to 0 degrees C and its pH to 4.8 and 5.4 inhibited the process of binding this bacteriocin-like factor by microbial cells. The presence of the substance with lysozyme properties in the preparation influenced the process of the adsorption of the main antibacterial component on microbial cells sensitive to lysozyme.
