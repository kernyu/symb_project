A mutant of Escherichia coli, isolated as hyper-resistant to UVC, is found to be hyper-resistant to UVA, H2O2, low concentrations of nalidixic acid, novobiocin, UVA plus H2O2 and UVA plus 8-methoxypsoralen. A mutational site (uvh) conferring the hyper-resistance phenotype to UVC, and presumably to other DNA damaging agents, has been mapped at the 89.9 min region on the chromosome. Complementation analysis with an F-prime uvh+/uvh- diploid strain showed that the uvh+ allele is dominant over uvh- in trans. Studies with a variety of plasmids, carrying various LexA regions, introduced into the UV hyper-resistant strain show that mutation at the uvh locus may be responsible for derepression of the SOS inducible repair system. Based on the results, it is suggested that uvh is a part of the SOS inducible system. A plausible explanation for the hyper-resistance phenotypes for various DNA damaging agents and a model for the genetic control of a second set of putative SOS regulons are presented.
