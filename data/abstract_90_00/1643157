In this study the hypothesis that inhibition of the de novo pathway results in stimulation of salvage pathway activity was tested. The key enzyme in the balance between these two pathways is ribonucleotide reductase (RR), which can be inhibited by hydroxyurea (HU). The metabolism of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine and 5-Aza-2 deoxycytidine (Aza-dC), which are activated via the salvage pathway, was evaluated in cells from Ara-C-sensitive and -resistant myelocytic leukemia cell line (BNML-Cl/0 and BNML-Cl/Ara-C). The combination of HU and Ara-C caused as much as a threefold increase of Ara-CTP; it significantly increased the incorporation of Ara-C into DNA and induced synergistic cytotoxicity, as evaluated in a colony assay. Even in the deoxycytidine (CdR) kinase-deficient Ara-C-resistant cell line, HU was partially able to restore sensitivity to Ara-C and Aza-dC. dCTP levels are reduced during the first 10 h after incubation with HU, but this effect vanishes at the time when phosphorylation is maximal. Increased CdR kinase activity in cell-free extracts could explain the enhanced synthetic salvage pathway activity, which is likely due to the fact that more enzyme is present (Vmax has increased by Km unchanged). RR inhibition combined with Ara-C might provide a means of eliminating leukemic cells with suboptimal anabolic salvage pathway activity, which otherwise survive Ara-C chemotherapy.
