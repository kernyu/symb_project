The morbidity of the infections caused by methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus increased in recent years. In order to know the resistance of MRSA to antimicrobial agents, the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antimicrobial agents against S. Aureus isolated from inpatients were measured. The presence of beta-lactamase in and the types of coagulase of the strains tested were determined as well. The results showed that MRSA accounted for 50.7% of the strains tested, the incidence of MRSA producing beta-lactamase was 85.1% and the coagulase of MRSA was all of type II. MRSA showed resistance to most of the lactam antibiotics and some of the aminoglycosides. Vancomycin and arbikacin had the highest activity against MRSA; other effective antibiotics were in the following order: amikacin, minocycline, tosulfloxacin and imipenem. It is suggested that serious infections caused by MRSA may be cured by using vancomycin, arbikacin or other antibiotics mentioned above.
