The development of resistance to antimicrobial agents by many bacterial pathogens has compromised traditional therapeutic regimens, making treatment of infections more difficult and frequently more expensive. Three factors have contributed to the development and spread of resistance: mutations in common genes that extend their spectrum of resistance, transfer of resistance genes among diverse microorganisms and increases in selective pressures in and outside of the hospital environment that enhance the development of resistant organisms. Some new resistance mechanisms are difficult to detect in the laboratory. Thus, resistant microorganisms may go unnoticed until they are widely disseminated in a hospital. The challenge for pharmacists, microbiologists and physicians is not only to contain the spread of existing resistant organisms, but also to prevent the emergence of new resistant pathogens by encouraging the rational and prudent use of antimicrobial agents.
