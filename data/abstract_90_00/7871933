The in vitro susceptibility of recently isolated respiratory tract pathogens (217 S. pneumoniae, 202 H. influenzae and 178 M. catarrhalis, has been examined against minocycline, doxycycline, amoxycillin, amoxyclavulanate, cefuroxime, clarithromycin and ciprofloxacin. M. catarrhalis was fully susceptible to all antibiotics except amoxycillin (62% susceptible). H. influenzae showed full susceptibility to minocycline, cefuroxime and ciprofloxacin but different percentages of resistance to the other antibiotics. Among S. pneumoniae isolates resistance was observed to all antibiotics tested between 12% to beta-lactams and 22% to doxycycline.
