OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the efficacy of lansoprazole, clarithromycin, and metronidazole (LCM) administered twice daily for 7 days. Because there is growing concern about the development of metronidazole-resistant H. pylori (HP) strains, we also tested a novel regimen consisting of lansoprazole, clarithromycin, and bismuth subsalicylate (LCB). METHODS: Patients with active HP infection and peptic ulcer, a history of peptic ulcer, or nonulcer dyspepsia were randomized to either lansoprazole 30 mg b.i.d., clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d., and metronidazole 500 mg b.i.d. or lansoprazole 30 mg b.i.d., clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d., and bismuth subsalicylate 524 mg b.i.d. (LCB) for 7 days. Compliance and side effects were recorded by using a diary. RESULTS: "Per protocol" eradication with LCM was achieved in 41 of 47 (87%). By using "intention to treat" analysis, LCM eradicated HP infection in 43 of 53 patients (81%). By using "per protocol" analysis, LCB eradicated HP infection in 40 of 47 patients (85%). On an "intention to treat" basis, LCB led to HP eradication in 42 of 52 (81%). The most common significant side effects observed with LCM were altered taste (39%) and abdominal pain (19%). With LCB, the most common significant side effects were altered taste (23%) and dark stools (23%). CONCLUSIONS: LCB for 7 days was as effective in eradicating HP infection as a 7-day course of LCM. Further studies evaluating the role of bismuth compounds in proton-pump inhibitor based triple therapy are warranted. Such therapy may have particular importance in areas where high metronidazole resistance is a concern.
