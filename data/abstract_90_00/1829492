Thirty-two patients with native valve infective endocarditis who presented over a 10-year period at our hospital were analyzed retrospectively. The presenting symptom was a persistent fever in 22 patients. In 30 patients, the New York Heart Association functional class was less than II before the development of endocarditis. Blood cultures were positive on all occasions in 24 out of 29 culture-positive patients. All of the viridans streptococci, accounting for 79% of the isolated pathogens, were highly susceptible to ampicillin. Treatment consisted of a 6 week course of antibiotics, usually ampicillin, at a dose of 12 grams/day. In 9 cases, we had to change or stop the antibiotics because of severe side effects. The longer the period before making a diagnosis, the more severe were the symptoms of congestive heart failure and the more frequent was the incidence of cerebral hemorrhage. To initiate treatment as early as possible, in order to minimize valve destruction and to reduce the risk of cerebral hemorrhage, serial blood cultures are recommended in patients with valvular heart disease or congenital heart disease and a persistent fever, with minimal cardiac symptoms.
