This survey was carried out on 35 cases of malaria, having occurred during a period of 4 months in a population of expatriates living in a zone III of chloroquino-resistance. So, the authors can recall actual frequency of non-typical forms of this endemia. They underline the sensitivity of orange acridine test and its interest in the biological diagnosis of the forms offering a low parasitemia. The survey demonstrates once again the limits of the recommended chemoprophylaxis and the remarkable efficiency of halofantrine, while suspecting a possible coming up of a resistance.
