A P-glycoprotein gene probe from the sheep parasitic nematode Haemonchus contortus was developed and used to analyse restriction fragment length polymorphisms between susceptible isolates and isolates resistant to either benzimidazole; levamisole and benzimidazole; or benzimidazole, ivermectin and closantel. No polymorphism could be correlated with any of the different resistances. A P-glycoprotein gene probe was also isolated from the human nematode parasite Onchocerca volvulus and an Onchocerca-specific PCR was developed.
