Parameters of natural and probe fluorescence of peripheral blood lymphocytes have been studied in 25 normal persons and 72 patients suffering from extensive forms of pulmonary tuberculosis who live in various radioecological conditions. It was found that in cell suspension the intensity of fluorescence of protein and the membrane-bound merocyanine 540 dye was 2.0-3.2 and 3.9-7.1 times higher, respectively, for the lymphocytes of the examined patients. For lymphocytes of the patients who live in radionuclide-contaminated areas fluorescence of reduced pyridine nucleotides and some fluorescent probes (ANS, DPGT, the ratio of eximer to monomer fluorescence of pyrene) and the merocyanine-photosensitized cell death were also found to increase. These can indicate some changes of cell membranes and reduction of the oxidation resistance of lymphocytes. There was not any substantial dependence on the changes in the parameters determined in the patients calculated radiation doses was revealed. It was found that biophysical tests, in particular, photosensitized cell death, are informative for estimation of severity of the tuberculous process and prognosis of its outcome in patients who live in adverse radioecological conditions.
