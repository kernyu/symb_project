Four species of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae harboring extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) were recovered in a single patient hospitalized in an intensive care unit. Among these isolates, we describe for the first time an ESBL-producing Providencia rettgeri strain. Bacteria from the same species were shown to be genetically related by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis. These strains produced the same TEM derivative ESBL, characterized as TEM-24. This enzyme had the peculiarity of being encoded by a large conjugative plasmid of 180 kb, never previously described for such an ESBL.
