The role of cytokine- and T helper (Th)-dependent lung mucosal antifungal immunity in murine invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) was investigated. Intact or leukopenic DBA/2 mice were resistant or highly susceptible, respectively, to infection caused by multiple intranasal injections of viable Aspergillus fumigatus conidia. Resistance was associated with unimpaired innate antifungal activity of pulmonary phagocytic cells, concomitant with high-level production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-12 and the presence of interstitial lymphocytes producing interferon-gamma and IL-2. Conversely, production of TNF-alpha and IL-12 was down-regulated in highly susceptible mice, which also had defective innate antifungal immunity and high-level production of IL-4 and IL-10 by lung lymphocytes. Resistance was increased in susceptible mice upon local IL-4 or IL-10 neutralization or IL-12 administration. These results indicate that, similar to observations in mice with disseminated aspergillosis, innate and Th1-dependent immunity play an essential role in host defense against IPA.
