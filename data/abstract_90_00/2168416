The transposon Tn10-encoded tetracycline resistance protein functions as a metal-tetracycline/H+ antiporter (Yamaguchi, A., Udagawa, T., and Sawai, T. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 4809-4813). The Ser65-Asp66 dipeptide is conserved in all known tetracycline antiporter proteins and is an important target for site-directed mutagenesis. When Asp66 was replaced by Asn, the transport activity was completely lost, whereas when it was replaced by Glu, the activity was reduced to 10% of the wild-type level, indicating that a negative charge at position 66 is essential for tetracycline transport. Replacement of Ser65 by Cys or Ala, in contrast, caused only a minor change in tetracycline transport activity. However, the Cys65 mutant antiporter was sensitive to sulfhydryl reagents. Complete inactivation of the Cys65 antiporter by N-ethylmaleimide was not prevented by the substrate. A less bulky reagent, methyl methanethiosulfonate, caused partial inactivation of the Cys65 antiporter without changing its affinity to the substrate. These results indicate that a region including the dipeptide plays an important role in metal-tetracycline transport except for substrate binding. It may act as a gate which opens on the charge-charge interaction between Asp66 and the metal-tetracycline.
