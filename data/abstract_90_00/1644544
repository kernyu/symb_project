The treatment of septic complications of cholecystectomy patients requires special attention. In a prospective study of 1009 consecutive cholecystectomy patients (including all acute and elective patients, excluding cases of malignancy), we routinely took cultures from the cystic duct and the gallbladder, and checked the strain for sensitivity. Positive cultures were found in 31.4% of the series, the most frequent bacteria being E. coli (50.3%). The aminoglycosides and the second and third generations of cephaloridins were found more specific for the strains that were cultured. While the new cephaloridins are the first choice for prophylaxis, the combination of aminoglycosides with ampicillin is to be preferred from the medical and cost effective standpoint while the aim is therapeutic.
