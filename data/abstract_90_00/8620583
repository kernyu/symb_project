Sterilization and disinfection in dental clinics and laboratories are important in controlling disease vectors such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We determined the inactivation of disinfectant effects of "Taisalite" and "Taifresh Ace" containing Irgasan DP300 on MRSA, Streptococcus pyogenes, Candida albicans, and HIV. Exposure for 10 seconds to 50% or 5% Taisalite solution inactivated HIV completely. HIV was also completely inactivated by 10 minutes of exposure to 50% or 5% of Taifresh Ace solution. Taisalite possessed strong bactericidal activity against S. pyogenes and MRSA. C. albicans was resistant to 10 to 30 second exposures to Taisalite. MRSA and C. albicans were killed completely by exposure to 90% Taifresh Ace solution for 10 minutes. S. pyogenes was not highly sensitive to Taifresh Ace. The present study showed that Irgasan DP300 containing Taisalite is an excellent disinfectant against HIV and MRSA and that Taifresh Ace is a useful detergent against these micro-organisms.
