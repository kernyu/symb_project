Following monochemotherapy with fludarabin phosphate (fludara), complete (18%), and partial remission (27%) with stabilization (45%) was recorded in patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, most of whom were resistant to alkylating cytostatic drugs and their combinations containing anthracyclines. Long-term remission was registered in patients with low and moderate grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, resistant to standard cytostatic treatment, due to the therapeutic synergism of fludara and cytosinarabinoside (FAVAMP).
