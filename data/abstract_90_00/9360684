Recent studies demonstrate that 14-membered macrolides increase permeability and destruction of Pseudomonas biofilms. The effect of a macrolide antibiotic, erythromycin, on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) biofilm on Silastic catheter materials in comparison with two different quinolone antibiotics, sparfloxacin (SPFX) and a new quinolone, SYN 1193, was examined. Two different MRSA strains were grown in biofilm, using Mueller-Hinton broth with and without the addition of 10% pooled normal human serum (PNHS), in a modified Robbins device, at 37 degrees C for 24, 48, and 72 hours. Two different clinical MRSA strains were used and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined at the time intervals mentioned. Three different dosages of each antibiotic were tested: 5.0, 20.0, and 50.0 micrograms/mL. In addition, a constant dosage of SPFX and SYN 1193, in combination with varying dosages of erythromycin, was tested under similar experimental conditions. SYN 1193 demonstrated the highest MBC in comparison to SPFX; addition of PNHS did not alter the effect of SYN 1193. However, erythromycin alone and in combination with SPFX and SYN 1193 had no effect on MBC. We conclude that (1) macrolide antibiotic erythromycin has poor MRSA biofilm permeability and killing in comparison to SPFX and SYN 1193, and (2) SYN 1193 had the highest MBC to MRSA biofilm.
