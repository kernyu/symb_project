Resistance or susceptibility to disseminated and mucosal Candida albicans infections in mice correlates with the development of protective or nonprotective T helper (Th) cell responses. To determine whether immunomodulatory activity on Th cell functions is an effect beyond that provided by antifungal therapy, mice with disseminated or gastrointestinal infection were treated with amphotericin B or fluconazole and assessed for mortality, fungus burden in the organs, and parameters of Th cell-dependent immunity. Both antimycotics produced protective CD4+ Th1 cell responses, as revealed by increased production of interleukin (IL)-12 and interferon-y, decreased production of IL-4, delayed-type hypersensitivity to fungal antigen, and the disappearance of antigen-specific IgE. Concomitant neutralization of endogenous IL-4 greatly increased the antifungal efficacy and the Th1-promoting activity of both agents. These results indicate that successful antifungal therapy alone or in combination with cytokine antagonists may rely on the induction of an appropriate Th antifungal cell response.
