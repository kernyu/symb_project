Sequence-specific PCR was used in six laboratories and a ligase detection reaction was used in one laboratory to detect the zidovudine-resistance mutation at codon 215 of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase DNA. The genotypes of 27 different clinical samples, including cultured HIV-1 isolates, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and plasma, were correctly identified by 140 of 154 (91%) assays. The sensitivity for detecting a mutation was 96% for HIV-1 reverse transcriptase DNA clone mixtures containing 30% mutant DNA and 62% for mixtures containing 6% mutant DNA.
