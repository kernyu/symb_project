The susceptibility of six Vibrio harveyi strains to antibiotics was studied. Four strains originally isolated from diseased penaeids and two reference strains originally isolated from either sea water (ATCC 25919) or diseased Talorchestia sp. (ATCC 14126) were used in the present study. Results revealed that all three strains isolated in Taiwan exhibited resistance against nitrofurantoin, novobiocin and sulphonamide. The two reference strains and the strain isolated in Indonesia were susceptible to these three antibiotics.
