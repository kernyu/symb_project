Postoperative infection remains a complication of surgical procedures, resulting in increased morbidity, mortality, and cost. The frequent polymicrobial etiology and emerging patterns of resistance continue to compromise cure rates. Although quinolones have many attractive properties for the surgical setting, combination therapy is routinely indicated for appropriate coverage. Advanced-generation quinolones, such as trovafloxacin, offer an increased antimicrobial spectrum, including activity against important surgical pathogens, and longer elimination half-lives. These newer agents may be used intravenously or orally as once-daily single-agent therapy for surgical prophylaxis, and in place of combination therapy for complex intra-abdominal and pelvic infections.
