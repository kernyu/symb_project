Two groups of proteins of 50-68 kD (A) and 12-14 kD (B) are the components of DNP preparations from rat thymus and liver obtained by washing with 0.075 M NaCl-0.024 M EDTA solution and deproteinization with phenol and dodecylsulfate (SDS). Immediately after irradiation with a dose of 10 Gy, there observed an approximately 1.5-fold increase in the content of only B proteins in the rat thymus fraction precipitated upon treatment with SDS-NaCl. The acidic amino acid content of this fraction and DNP preparation obtained without treatment with SDS amounts to 25 mol%; the ratio to basic amino acids was 1.3-1.4. The comparison of the amino acid content in the above DNP preparation and the "supramolecular DNA" preparation, described in the literature, that was obtained by the same phenol deproteinization and contained about 50 mol% of acidic amino acids, indicates the presence in the "supramolecular DNA" preparation of a component that increases upon irradiation: the component consists almost completely of acidic amino acids and is eliminated completely from the DNP preparation by washing with 0.075 M NaCl-0.024 M EDTA prior to deproteinization. The amino acid composition of the protein fraction A is presented.
