We have previously established a vincristine resistant human lung cancer cell line (PC-9/VCR) by a stepwise exposure of parental line PC-9 to vincristine. In this study the resistant cells showed enhanced vincristine cytotoxicity in the presence of cytochalasin B and D. The increase in cytotoxicity was associated with an enhanced accumulation and a reduced efflux of vincristine. Colchicine and taxol had no effects on vincristine accumulation. Several cytoplasmic proteins were overexpressed in the resistant cells. The two major ones, with molecular weights of 58.8 kDa and 83.2 kDa, were shown by western blotting to be beta-tubulin and actin, respectively. The polymerized tubulin level in the resistant cells was significantly (p < 0.05) higher than that in the parental cells. These results suggest that the cellular cytoskeletons might play an important role in VCR resistance in the PC-9/VCR human lung cancer cell line.
