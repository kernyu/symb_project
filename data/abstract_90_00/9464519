The mouse Lsh/Ity/Bcg locus regulates macrophage activation for antimicrobial activity against intracellular pathogens, and the Nramp1 gene was isolated as its candidate. In the present study, a full length cDNA for human NRAMP2 has been isolated and characterized. Nucleotide sequence analysis reveals that the cDNA, 4142 bp in length, coded for a protein of 561 amino acid residues with a molecular weight mass of 61,456. Predicted amino acid sequence analysis of the NRAMP2 molecule indicates that NRAMP1 and NRAMP2 sequences share 64% identical residues overall, whereas only 21% at the NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain, where the NRAMP1 molecule was associated with microtubules, was found to be identical. This suggests that the NH2-terminal region of the NRAMP2 molecule may have a particular function, different from that of the NRAMP1 molecule.
