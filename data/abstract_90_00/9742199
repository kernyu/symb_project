We review and illustrate the wild-type mitotic cycle of Aspergillus nidulans and report the sequence alterations in six mutant alleles of the A. nidulans benA, beta-tubulin, gene. These alleles confer heat sensitivity and resistance to the antifungal, antimicrotubule compound benomyl, and they have been very important in the study of mitosis and microtubule function in A. nidulans. The mutations are novel and fall at amino acids 50, 134, and 257. We have examined the phenotypes conferred by the mutations at restrictive temperatures. None blocks the assembly of microtubules. One allele, benA33, blocks anaphase A and partially inhibits the disassembly of cytoplasmic microtubules in mitosis. We also often observe abnormal spindle morphologies in strains carrying benA33. Another allele, benA31, causes arrest in mitosis with short mitotic spindles and, thus, appears to inhibit spindle elongation.
