A big problem of nosocomial infections is some refractory infections, so that present important nosocomial infections are deep infections by MRSA and weakly virulent gram-negative bacilli such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are not susceptible to many antimicrobial agents. It is also noteworthy that MRSA can infect to both immunonormal and immunocompromised patients, although clinical signs of that infection are much more severe in the latters. On the other hand, weakly virulent bacilli can infect to only immunocompromised patients. Immunocompromised states are divided into two categories, namely general and local deficiencies. The mechanism of general immunodeficiency is mainly depend upon leukopenia or diminishment of phagocytic activity of them, and that of local immunodeficiency is bases on formation of biofilms which protect bacteria from phagocytosis and killing effect of antimicrobial agents. In this paper, it is emphasized that both countermeasure for nosocomial infections and adequate use of antimicrobial agents or immunomodulators are necessary to decrease number of patients with hospital infections.
