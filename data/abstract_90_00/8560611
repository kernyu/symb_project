The efficacy of cyclosporin-A, a potent immunosuppressive agent, has not been clearly proven in the management of childhood nephrotic syndrome. The occurrence of early relapse as the dose of cyclosporin is tapered or as soon as the drug is stopped and the potential nephrotoxic effects of prolonged treatment have caused it to be used in limited cases. We report an eighteen-month-old boy with steroid toxicity and alkylating agents-resistant nephrotic syndrome, who subsequently went very quickly into remission lasting at least one year after receiving cyclosporin-A for only three months.
