Neurons containing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) diaphorase exhibit high resistance to several excitotoxins. In the neocortex and striatum, however, these neurons are sensitive to kainic acid. Here we report that, 2 weeks after i.p. injection of kainic acid, the number of NADPH diaphorase neurons in the hilus and CA1 subfield was decreased, whereas the cell counts in the other hippocampal areas were to a great extent similar to those for the controls. We propose that the loss of NADPH diaphorase neurons in the hippocampus after systemic injection of kainic acid is associated with the pathophysiological processes involved in the spreading of epileptic seizure activity rather than to the direct neurotoxic effect of the kainic acid per se.
