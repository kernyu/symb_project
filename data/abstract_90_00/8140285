Actinomycetes have the genetic capability to synthesize many different biologically active secondary metabolites and of these compounds, antibiotics predominate in therapeutic and commercial importance. Intensive research often centres on the use of molecular techniques to investigate the physiology and genetics of antibiotic biosynthesis with a view to improving production. The isolation of clones of Streptomyces hygroscopicus, the producer of geldanamycin, which synthesizes geldanamycin in S. lividans, is reported. Molecular approaches using genes for elongation factors (tuf) were used in attempts to increase the fermentation yield of kirromycin, whilst probes for aphD and sph, genes for streptomycin phosphotransferases, were used to gather information on streptomycin genes in soil. Actinomycete populations in soil and earthworms may help in developing a strategy for discovering additional antimicrobials in soil. The relationship of proline metabolism to the secondary metabolite undecylprodigiosin and the carbon regulation of spiramycin biosynthesis in S. ambofaciens is also reported.
