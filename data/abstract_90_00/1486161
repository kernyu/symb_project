Twenty-eight Helicobacter pylori-positive patients with metronidazole-resistant isolates and 25 with metronidazole-sensitive isolates were treated for 14 days with 40 mg omeprazole nocte plus 500 mg amoxycillin t.d.s. Eradication of H. pylori, defined as absence of the organism one month after cessation of treatment, was assessed using the [14C]urea breath test. The eradication rate in patients with metronidazole-resistant isolates was 14/28 (50%) while that in patients was metronidazole-sensitive isolates was 12/25 (48%). In contrast to these encouraging eradication rates, very poor results were obtained with a 7-day course of omeprazole (40 mg nocte) in combination with erythromycin ethylsuccinate (500 mg q.d.s.) and tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate tablets (120 mg q.d.s.). The latter eradication rates were 3/20 (15%) in patients taking erythromycin tablets and 3/19 (16%) in those taking a liquid formulation of erythromycin. All treatment regimens were well tolerated and all patients completed the prescribed course of therapy.
