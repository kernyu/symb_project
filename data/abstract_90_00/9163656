Transmission of multidrug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) presents a serious problem for infection control in hospitals, particularly in the context of co-infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We report on the use of molecular genetic tools to allow rapid assessment of samples from patients potentially infected with MDR-TB. Sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage samples were obtained from two HIV-positive patients with suspected tuberculosis, who had previous contact with a known MDR-TB index case. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used directly on clinical samples to amplify genetic loci associated with rifampicin resistance (rpoB), and strain-specific polymorphisms (the direct repeat (DR) region). Drug resistance was determined using a commercially available kit for detection of point mutations in the rpoB gene (Inno-Lipa RifTB; Innogenetics, Belgium), and confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Strain variation was determined using the spoligotyping method, based on the presence or absence of variable linker sequences within the DR region. In one patient, infection with a MDR strain identical to that of a known index case was demonstrated. A second patient, although positive for M. tuberculosis, was found to be infected with a rifampicin-sensitive strain. Results were obtained within 48 h, allowing appropriate treatment to be initiated and infection control measures to be implemented. PCR-based tests for strain-typing and for identification of rifampicin resistance provide important tools for identifying patients with MDR-TB and for rapid monitoring of potential nosocomial spread of MDR-TB. Prompt confirmation or exclusion of possible transmission allows early clinical intervention to prevent future outbreaks of multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis.
