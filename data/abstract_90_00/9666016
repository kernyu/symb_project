The methyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside (MDG) test has been shown to be superior to motility testing in differentiating Enterococcus faecium from E. gallinarum. In the present study, 33 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) isolates collected as part of a stool surveillance study were compared by using motility and MDG. Motility testing identified all 33 isolates as E. faecium, whereas MDG identified 11 of the 33 isolates as nonmotile E. gallinarum. The MDG results were confirmed by sequencing the 16S rDNA V6-to-V8 region. We conclude that the MDG test is a necessary component of routine VRE screening.
