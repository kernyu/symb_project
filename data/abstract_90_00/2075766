The dynamic study of the microecological state of the intestine in 41 newborns up to the age of 3 months has been made by biochemical and bacteriological investigation methods. The results of the biochemical rapid analysis have been found to be in complete agreement with those of the bacteriological analysis and, besides, to provide essential additional data. The biochemical rapid analysis permits the evaluation of the state resistance to the colonization of the intestine in children, starting from the age of 6 days. The presence of beta-alanine and ninhydrin-positive unidentified Nos. 7, 8a-1, 8d, 9, 10, 11 and 21 is indicative of a greater decrease in the level of the colonization of the digestive tract.
