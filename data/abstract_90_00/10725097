Stable and lectin-recognizable DNA-carbohydrate conjugates were prepared by diazo coupling of lactose and cellobiose derivatives to fragmented salmon testes DNA. The diazo coupling is suggested to take place selectively to guanine bases since the amount of lactose moiety introduced was directly proportional to the G content of various DNAs with different G contents. According to the CD spectra, the conjugates bearing carbohydrate less than 25% content kept a typical B-type conformation similar to native DNA. The conjugates possessed higher melting temperature and stronger nuclease resistance both to exo- and endonucleases than native DNA. Gel shift assay and fluorescence binding assay showed that the DNA-lactose conjugates were specifically bound to galactose-specific lectin RCA(120) with strong binding affinity (Ka = 10(4)-10(5) M(-1)) due to glycoside cluster effect. This facile method will be a useful protocol of molecular design for cell-targeted gene therapy.
