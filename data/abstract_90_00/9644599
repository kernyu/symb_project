Antimicrobial activity of 6 macrolides was determined using a micro-broth dilution method, against 535 clinical isolates of 22 species, which were isolated in 1996 from 325 facilities in Japan. Results were as follows. 1. In general, antimicrobial activities of 14-membered macrolides were higher than those of 16-membered macrolides. The antimicrobial activities of 14-membered macrolides were in the order of clarithromycin (CAM), erythromycin (EM), roxithromycin (RXM). Among 16-membered macrolides, rokitamycin (RKM) was the most potent, josamycin (JM) was next potent followed by midecamycin (MDM). More numbers of highly-resistant strain of > 100 micrograms/ml were recognized in 14-membered macrolides than in 16-membered macrorides. 2. Most of S. pyogenes (group A) strains were distributed in the susceptible range and almost none was found in the resistant range. 3. S. pneumoniae strains were distributed widely from the susceptible range to the highly resistant range, and as high as 37.1% fell into the high resistance of > 100 micrograms/ml range. 4. Against Peptostreptococcus spp. and MRSA, 16-membered macrolides were more effective than 14-membered macrorlides, and their antibacterial activities were in the order of RKM, JM, MDM. Ratio of high-resistant strains of > 100 micrograms/ml against 14-membered macrolides was much higher than that against 16-membered macrolies. 5. Most of M. (B.) catarrhalis strains were distributed in the susceptible range of < or = 1.56 micrograms/ml, and most of H. influenzae strains were distributed within the moderately resistant and the resistant ranges. 6. In M. (B.) catarrhalis and H. influenzae, no correlation between macrolide resistance and beta-lactamase production was recognized. 7. Most of C. jejuni strains were susceptible to all macrolides used in this study.
