Managing patients infected with antibiotic resistant bacteria is becoming one of the major clinical obstacles facing physicians who treat patients in long-term care facilities (LTCFs). Penicillin-resistant pneumococci (PRP), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), gram-negative bacteria that produce extended-spectrum and ampC-type beta-lactamase enzymes, and quinolone-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria are the major resistant pathogens that are emerging in these settings. The mechanisms responsible for the evolution of these antibiotic resistant organisms (molecular rearrangement of penicillin binding protein genes, acquisition of a mobile genetic element, and point mutation that alter the active site) are reviewed. Vancomycin intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA) and multidrug efflux pumps in gram-negative bacteria are also threatening our most potent antimicrobials. Aggressive screening, education, antibiotic-control measures, and immunization are advocated as important preventive measures. The combined efforts of the medical directors, infection-control personnel, and administrators are needed to stem this problem.
