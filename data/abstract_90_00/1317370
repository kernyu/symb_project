The in-vitro activity of four peptide antibiotics against 43 penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was evaluated. The activity of SKF104662 was slightly greater to that of vancomycin, teicoplanin and daptomycin (MICs for 90% of the isolates tested 0.06, 0.25, 0.12 and 0.25 mg/L, respectively) and superior to the other 15 drugs tested. The serotype of these penicillin-resistant strains was also determined. The strains that belonged to the predominant serotype 9 were resistant only to penicillin. All six erythromycin- and clindamycin-resistant strains belonged to serotype 6 and three of them were also resistant to chloramphenicol and tetracycline (plus penicillin).
