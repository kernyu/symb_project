A 74-year-old man with multiple myeloma developed facial and cervical cellulitis and severe sepsis as a complication of surgery (alar region basal cell carcinoma). The etiological agent was, surprisingly, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP). The patient successfully received 16 days of antibiotics. Amoxicillin was given as monotherapy during the last 14 days of treatment. PRSP can be responsible not only for otitis media, pneumonia or meningitis, but also for various other types of infection in patients with predisposing factors.
