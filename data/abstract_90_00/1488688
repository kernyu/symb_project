A comparative trial of the combination of mefloquine or MSP with tetracycline was carried out in fifty-one adult Thai male patients with acute falciparum malaria. The patients were randomized to receive either the combination of tetracycline (250 mg qid for 7 days) with mefloquine 4 tablets (1,000 mg) or with MSP 4 tablets (one tablet contains 250 mg mefloquine, 500 mg sulfadoxine and 25 mg pyrimethamine). Fifty patients had a complete 28-day follow-up period. Both regimens produced similar efficacy with no difference in adverse effects. In the mefloquine plus tetracycline group, the cure rate was 72% (18/25). One patient had an RIII response, the others showed initial response to the treatment with FCT and PCT of 40.7 +/- 27.4 and 76.2 +/- 34.2 hours (mean +/- SD) respectively. However, 6 patients developed recrudescence between days 17 and 29 (RI), 3 of these had vomiting. In the MSP plus tetracycline group, the cure rate was 76% (19/25). The means (+/- SD) of FCT and PCT were 44.7 +/- 38.0 and 80.6 +/- 25.0 hours, respectively. Six patients had recrudescence between days 17 and 31 (RI), 2 of these had vomiting. Although the addition of tetracycline improved the cure rate of mefloquine when compared with standard dose of mefloquine alone (3 tablets), these combinations seem to be useful in areas where alternative drugs are not available.
