The clinical analysis of 59 cases of Streptococcus faecalis sepsis in infants aged 1 to 5 months has been presented. Streptococcus faecalis strains isolated from the blood were characterized by drug resistance especially against penicillin or its derivatives. The clinical picture of the Streptococcus faecalis sepsis in a majority of cases is similar to that of other Gram-positive sepsis. Meningitis, first of all purulent, was noted in twenty percent of infected children. About one third of neonates with the Streptococcus faecalis sepsis showed intrauterine infection. The mortality index in children with the Streptococcus faecalis sepsis was equal to 10.2%.
