A series of compounds related to the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor (NNRTI) oxathiin carboxanilide (UC84) were evaluated for activity against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to determine structural requirements for anti-HIV activity. Twenty-seven compounds representative of the more than 400 Uniroyal Chemical Company (UC) compounds were evaluated for structure-activity relationships. Several of the compounds evaluated were highly active, with 50% effective concentrations in the nanomolar range and therapeutic indices of > 1,000. Highly synergistic anti-HIV activity was observed for each compound when used in combination with 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine; additive to slightly synergistic interactions were observed with the compounds used in combination with dideoxycytidine. In combination with the NNRTI costatolide, only UC38 synergistically inhibited HIV type 1. Residues in the RT which, when mutated, impart resistance to the virus isolates selected in cell culture, against virus variants with site-directed mutations, and against RTs containing defined single amino acid changes. The mutations included changes in RT amino acids 100, 101, 103, 106, 108, and 181. The results with isolates selected in cell culture indicate that the carboxanilide compounds interact with the RT at two vulnerable sites, selecting UC-resistant virus isolates with the Y-to-C mutation at position 181 (Y181C) or the L100I substitution. A resistant virus isolate containing both Y181C combination with calanolide A, an NNRTI which retains activity against virus with the single Y181C mutation, UC10 rapidly selected a virus isolate with the K103N mutation. The merits of selecting potential candidate anti-HIV agents to be used in rational combination drugs design as part of an armamentarium of highly active anti-HIV compounds are discussed.
