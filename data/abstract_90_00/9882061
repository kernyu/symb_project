A retrospective study of patterns of infection in 168 patients admitted during 1995 and 1996 in the burns-unit of Khoula hospital at Muscat, Oman was performed. Out of 819 isolates positive for pathogenic bacterial culture, there were 326 (39.8%) isolates positive for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. Incidence of MRSA infection was marginally more than that of Pseudomonas aeroginosa. The proportion of patients developing MRSA infection sometime or the other during their burns-unit stay ranging from 1 to 112 days rose from 48% in 1995 to 52.7% in 1996. No sophisticated tests were done to identify the MRSA strain but study of the antibiograms of each MRSA positive isolate showed very similar patterns of sensitivity to different antibiotics. This suggests the source of infection to be common and in all probability 'noscomial', since all patients acquired MRSA infection in the hospital. The susceptibility of MRSA to ciprofloxacin, cotrimoxazole and fucidin was 76, 51 and 37% of isolates in 1995, and 59, 44 and 26% in 1996 were susceptible to these drugs. Vancomycin was the antibiotic to which most MRSA cultures were susceptible, but partial resistance was reported due to very low susceptibility observed in 1.4% of the isolates in 1995 and 1.1% of the isolates in 1996. The control measures being practiced in the burns-unit of Khoula Hospital, especially mechanical cleaning and chemical disinfection of all surfaces, are discussed in detail. This paper emphasizes the need for preventive measures against MRSA infection in the burns-unit.
