We report a neonatal case of severe, life-threatening Kasabach-Merritt syndrome that was successfully treated with interferon-alpha: This patient had a huge hemangioma of the right leg and a general bleeding tendency. Although the condition initially responded to steroid and radiation therapy, after a relapse, no therapy including steroids, radiation, aspirin, and dipyridamole was effective. Because of severe thrombocytopenia and extension of the hemangioma to the pelvic region, surgical intervention was not indicated. Interferon-alpha therapy was started on day 61 of life. During the therapy the platelet counts increased by more than tenfold and reached the normal level in a month. The size of the hemangioma dramatically decreased. The administration of interferon-alpha might be indicated as a therapy for severe, life-threatening Kasabach-Merritt syndrome, especially when there is resistance to steroid or radiation therapy.
