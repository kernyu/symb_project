Whole-kidney function and glomerular hemodynamics were evaluated after acute (50 mg/kg, iv, in bolus) and short-term chronic (50 mg mg/kg, ip, 5 days) acyclovir (ACV) and short-term chronic ganciclovir (Gan; 30 mg/kg, ip, 5 days) treatment in envolemic Munich-Wistar rats. The evaluation of whole-kidney function of the ACV groups showed a significant reduction in total GFR (0.96 +/- 0.10 to 0.28 +/- 0.02 mL/min in the acute group, P < 0.05, and 1.04 +/- 0.09 to 0.33 +/- 0.04 mL/min in the chronic group, P < 0.05) with a marked increase in total renal vascular resistance (TRVR) (33 +/- 5 to 122 +/- 26 mm Hg.min/mL in the acute group and 28 +/- 3 to 74 +/- 18 mm Hg.min/mL in the chronic group, P < 0.05) and a reduction in RPF (2.29 +/- 0.25 to 0.81 +/- 0.15 mL/min in the acute group and 2.57 +/- 0.36 to 1.30 +/- 0.40 mL/min in the chronic group, P < 0.05). Conversely, urinary flow (V') was unchanged (3.6 +/- 0.4 to 3.6 +/- 0.2 microL/min in the acute group) or elevated (3.7 +/- 0.6 to 6.6 +/- 1.4 microL/min in the chronic group, P < 0.05). The evaluation of glomerular hemodynamics after ACV treatment showed a reduction in single-nephron GFR (SNGFR) (46.4 +/- 5.3 to 26.2 +/- 3.4 nL/min in the acute group and 38.7 +/- 5.7 to 21.1 +/- 5.7 nL/min in the chronic group, P < 0.05), a significant elevation in total arteriolar resistance (RT) (2.90 +/- 0.44 to 4.94 +/- 0.77 x 10(10) dyn.s.cm-5 in the acute group and 3.72 +/- 0.45 to 9.00 +/- 2.40 x 10(10) dyn.s.cm-5 in the chronic group, P < 0.05) and a severe reduction in glomerular plasma flow rate (QA) (152.6 +/- 29.5 to 103.8 +/- 27.8 nL/min in the acute group and 149.1 +/- 29.8 to 68.5 +/- 10.0 nL/min in the chronic group, P < 0.05). However, the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient, Kf, was changed only in the chronic group (0.1002 +/- 0.0165 to 0.0499 +/- 0.0090 nL/(s.mm Hg), P < 0.05). After Gan treatment, no changes were observed in GFR (1.04 +/- 0.09 to 0.96 +/- 0.08 mL/min, with the maintenance of RPF (2.57 +/- 0.36 to 2.66 +/- 0.34 mL/min) and a nonsignificant reduction in TRVR (28 +/- 3 to 20 +/- 3 mm Hg.min/mL. The short-term Gan treatment also showed a different pattern in glomerular hemodynamics by inducing an elevation in SNGFR (38.7 +/- 5.7 to 50.3 +/- 2.8 nL/min, P < 0.05) with no changes in QA (150 +/- 30 to 135 +/- 22 nL/min) and a mild vasodilation, RT (3.7 +/- 0.5 to 2.7 +/- 0.3 x 10(10) dyn.s.cm-5, P < 0.05) associated with an increment in Kf (0.1002 +/- 0.0165 to 0.2400 +/- 0.0700 nL/(s.mm Hg), P < 0.05). Thus, ACV induced acute renal failure by reducing GFR and SNGFR by an increase in TRVR and RT with a reduction in RPF and QA. Also, after short-term treatment with ACV, a reduction in Kf led to a reduction of SNGFR. On the other hand, Gan treatment did not induce acute renal failure by the adopted techniques.
