Fortimicin-A (FTM-A; astromicin)-resistance genes (fmr genes) isolated from six producers of the FTM-group of antibiotics were analysed. These genes could be classified into two types by the resistance profiles to aminoglycoside antibiotics and by their DNA homologies. Three genes, fmrT from the istamycin producer Streptomyces tenjimariensis ATCC 31603, fmrS from the sannamycin producer Streptomyces sannanensis IFO 14239 and fmrH from the sporaricin producer Saccharopolyspora hirsuta ATCC 20501, conferred resistance to FTM-A, kanamycin (Km) and neomycin B (Nm-B), but not to gentamicin (Gm). The other three genes, fmrO from the FTM-A producer Micromonospora olivasterospora ATCC 21819, fmrM from the antibiotic SF-2052 producer Micromonospora sp. SF-2098 (ATCC 31580) and fmrD from the dactimicin producer Dactylosporangium matsuzakiense ATCC 31570, conferred resistance to FTM-A, Km and Gm, but not to Nm-B. No DNA homology was detected between the two types of the resistance genes in Southern-blot analysis. The present results revealed that, in spite of the similarity of their biosynthesis genes, there are at least two different types of resistance genes among the FTM-group antibiotic producers.
