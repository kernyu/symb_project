We treated six patients with mucosal leishmaniasis who failed to respond to glucantime (20 mg/kg/day) with ambisome (2-5 grams total dose). The daily dose was 2-3 mg/kg/day given for a minimum of 20 days. After 26-38 months of follow up, five patients were clinically cured. One relapsed after six months. No side effects of therapy were observed apart from headache after infection. Ambisome is a therapeutic option for patients with mucosal leishmaniasis unresponsive to antimonials.
