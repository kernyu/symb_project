In contrast to adult mice, young A/J mice, developed an acute hepatitis following infection with Mouse Hepatitis virus type 3. 100% of the young animals died 4 to 5 days after the infection and high levels of virus were found in the liver and peritoneal exudate. Very low levels of IFN-gamma were found in the serum and peritoneal exudate of infected young mice. This was in contrast to the levels observed in adult mice. Spleen cells and macrophage cultures from young A/J mice, again in contrast to adult A/J mice, were shown to be unable to synthesize IFN-gamma and IFN-alpha/beta respectively. Macrophages from either young or adult A/J mice were able to be activated with exogenous recombinant IFN-gamma or IFN-alpha/beta, enabling both sets of cells to restrict MHV3 replication. The results indicate that the ability of the immune system to synthesize IFN-gamma and IFN-alpha/beta may play a major role in the age-dependent resistance of A/J mice to MHV3.
