Two synthetic 2,6-disubstituted 4-anilinoquinazolines exerted a significant effect on the G+ bacteria Bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus. None of 12 tested derivatives influenced Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Derivatives having the aromatic ring non-substituted or substituted by bromine, the pyrimidine ring by phenyl, morpholine or piperidine and the aniline skeleton non-substituted or substituted by methyl or amino group exerted a considerable antibacterial activity.
