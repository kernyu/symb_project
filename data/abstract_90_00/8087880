Botryotinia fuckeliana, the causal agent of grey mould, was biolistically transformed to hygromycin B resistance using a plasmid (pOHT) containing a bacterial hygromycin phosphotransferase gene fused to regulatory sequences from Aspergillus nidulans. Multiple copies of the plasmid, precipitated onto tungsten particles, were delivered into the conidia by a helium-driven gene gun. Southern analysis showed that the plasmid was integrated into the fungal genome at one single locus. After five subsequent transfers on selective medium, all transformants were mitotically stable. When propagated on non-selective medium, four out of eight transformants retained their resistance to hygromycin B. Southern analysis of the fifth generation of transformants showed that no genetic rearrangements occurred during vegetative growth of stable transformants.
