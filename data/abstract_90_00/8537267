SYN987, 1193 and 1253 are new fluorinated quinolones with enhanced activity against Gram-positive bacteria. The MICs of SYN 987, 1193 or 1253 were studied by an agar dilution method against 88 streptococci (including penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae), 30 enterococci and 62 Staphylococcus aureus. SYN 987, 1193 and 1253 were 2 to 4 times more active than sparfloxacin and 16-64 times more active than older fluoroquinolones against all streptococci and ciprofloxacin-resistant S. aureus. This study demonstrates that SYN 987, 1193 and 1253 are extremely potent antibacterial agents which deserve further evaluation.
