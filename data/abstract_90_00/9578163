The activities of cefepime and amikacin alone or in combination against an isogenic pair of Enterobacter cloacae strains (wild type and stably derepressed, ceftazidime-resistant mutant) were compared using an experimental model of pneumonia in non-leucopenic rats. Animals were infected by administering 8.4 log10 cfu of E. cloacae intratracheally, and therapy was initiated 12 h later. At that time, the animals' lungs showed bilateral pneumonia and contained more than 7 log10 E. cloacae cfu/g tissue. Because rats eliminate amikacin and cefepime much more rapidly than humans, renal impairment was induced in all animals to simulate the pharmacokinetic parameters of humans. In-vitro susceptibilities showed an inoculum effect with cefepime proportional to the bacterial titre against the two strains, but more pronounced with the stably derepressed mutant strain, whereas with bacterial concentrations of up to 7 log10 cfu/mL, no inoculum effect was observed with amikacin. In-vitro killing indicated that antibiotic combinations were synergic only at intermediate concentrations. At peak concentrations, the combination was merely as effective as amikacin alone. At trough concentrations, a non-significant trend towards the superiority of the combination over each antibiotic alone was noted. Moreover, cefepime was either bacteriostatic or permitted regrowth of the organisms in the range of antibiotic concentrations tested. Although each antibiotic alone failed to decrease bacterial counts in the lungs, regardless of the susceptibility of the strain used, the combination of both antibiotics was synergic and induced a significant decrease in the lung bacterial count 24 h after starting therapy when compared with tissue bacterial numbers in untreated animals or animals treated with either antibiotic alone. No resistant clones emerged during treatment with any of the antibiotic regimens studied.
