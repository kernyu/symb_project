Administration of empirical antibiotic therapy is now standard practice in the management of febrile neutropenia, but there has been considerable debate about the selection of an efficacious empirical antimicrobial regimen over the past 2 decades. A variety of approaches, including both monotherapeutic and multidrug regimens, have been demonstrated to be effective, although no one regimen has been proven to be superior to another. Changes in the epidemiology of infectious organisms and the growing emergence of highly drug-resistant strains make it necessary to continually reevaluate the therapeutic options. Fortunately, the number of therapeutic options has also been broadening as new antimicrobial agents, including third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenem antibiotics such as imipenem and meropenem, become available. Optimal management is directed by the findings of a clinical evaluation of the patient as well as an awareness of institutional patterns of infection and susceptibility of likely infecting organisms.
