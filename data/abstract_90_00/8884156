A 42-year-old woman presented with a well-defined pruritic erythematous scaly plaque on the sole of each foot. The lesions, first noted about 15 years previously, were located in the medial plantar region and extended laterally. Mycological study revealed infection by Scopulariopsis brevicaulis. Treatment with oral itraconazole led to temporary improvement, but the symptoms returned after treatment had been stopped (presumably due to re-infection from ungual foci). Similar results were subsequently obtained with oral terbinafine. S. brevicaulis is an aetiologic agent of onychomycosis, panophthalmia following a penetrating eye injury and generalized infections in immunocompromised patients, but it is not considered as habitual fungal pathogen of the skin. Cutaneous lesions caused by S. brevicaulis are very rare. Our case was resistant to terbinafine and itracomazole.
