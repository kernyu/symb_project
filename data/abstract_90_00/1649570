High-level resistance to quinolones has previously been shown to occur in Campylobacter spp. both in vitro and in patients treated with quinolones. We have selected isolates that are resistant to quinolones by plating cells from a susceptible C. jejuni strain, UA535, on medium containing nalidixic acid at 32 micrograms/ml. Fluctuation analysis indicated that resistance occurred by mutation at a frequency of 5 x 10(-8) per cell plated. Unlike what is observed with other gram-negative organisms, the nalidixic acid-resistant mutants demonstrated high-level cross-resistance (MIC, greater than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml) to newer quinolones, including ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and temafloxacin, yet remained susceptible to coumermycin A1 and several other unrelated antibiotics. Mutants with an identical resistance phenotype could also be selected from UA535 with ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin at a similar frequency. To study the mechanism of quinolone resistance, DNA gyrases were purified from C. jejuni UA535 and two resistant mutants by heparin-agarose and novobiocin-Sepharose chromatography. After the respective enzyme concentrations were adjusted to equivalent units of activity in the DNA supercoiling reaction, the DNA gyrases from the resistant mutants were found to be 100-fold less susceptible than the wild-type enzyme to inhibition by quinolones. Subunit switching experiments with purified A and B subunits from the wild type and one of the quinolone-resistant mutants indicated that an alteration in the A subunit was responsible for resistance. These results show that a single-step mutation can occur in vitro in the gene encoding DNA gyrase in C. jejuni, producing clinically relevant levels of resistance to the newer quinolones.
