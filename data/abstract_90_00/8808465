We describe a strategy to introduce preferentially the dominant selectable marker neoR into the human chromosome within a monochromosome hybrid cell line. Integration of a construct containing the marker is mediated by human-specific repeat elements that promote multilocus human-specific integration with a single targeting vector. We tested two classes of repeat elements: the Alu family of SINE repeats and the Line1 repeat family. We show that Alu sequences alone are insufficient to direct human-specific integration but when used in combination with a Line1 element, or when only Line1 elements are included, integration of the vector into the human component of a monochromosome somatic cell hybrid is favored. The vectors also carry sequences that facilitate mapping and selective cloning of the targeted region. This strategy provides a means to generate selectable human subchromosomal fragments that can be used for localization of genes through positional cloning and, more important, for the identification of functional units through DNA transfer.
