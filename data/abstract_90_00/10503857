OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the pathogenicity of Staphylococcus lugdunensis in acute oral infection. STUDY DESIGN: S. lugdunensis was isolated from patients with acute oral infections and from healthy control subjects. Antibiotic susceptibility, in vitro cellular toxicity, in vivo virulence, and hemolytic activity testing and dot blot analysis were performed. The statistical significance of in vitro cellular toxicity was determined by means of analysis of variance. RESULTS: Isolated from the infected patients, S. lugdunensis showed resistance to penicillin, ampicillin, methicillin, cephalothin, and clindamycin, exhibited virulence in vivo, and showed delta-like hemolysin activity. Four of the 6 strains of S. lugdunensis gave synergistic hemolysis. In dot blot analysis, S. lugdunensis showed a positive reaction to the probe of the delta-hemolysin gene in S. aureus. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that S. lugdunensis may be a potential pathogen in acute oral infection.
