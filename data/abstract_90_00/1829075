The disruptive effect on, and potentially hazardous exposure to nosocomial infection, together with the relative cost of hospitalization, of children favours the need for ambulatory care. An increasing proportion of infections in children are due to beta-lactam resistant Gram-positive organisms. Teicoplanin is proposed as a suitable candidate for treating paediatric patients with serious Gram-positive infections in hospital or ambulatory care. The experience acquired in children is still limited. However, over 200 paediatric patients have been treated with once or twice daily im or iv teicoplanin in daily doses of 3-10 mg/kg. The main clinical diagnoses were skin and soft tissue infections, skeletal infections and septicaemia. The drug was safe and clinical efficacy was greater than 90%. Comparative studies with defined uniform protocols are now required to assess the potential of this drug.
