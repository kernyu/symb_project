A randomized placebo-controlled trial treating cutaneous lesions due to Leishmania major with intralesionnel glucantime, was conducted in El Guettar between december 1994 and June 1995, in order to assess efficacy of this therapy under field conditions. It included 109 patients: 52 were administrated glucantime and 57 received local treatment (eosin 5% and alcohol 95%). Prognostic factors were similar in both groups. Results did not reveal a significant difference between glucantime and eosin regarding the rapidity of the healing of lesions. However, scars seem to be of better quality among the glucantime group. Bacterial super infection was noticed among 57.6% of humid lesions sampled among 33 patients. Isolated strains included group A streptococcus (22%), staphylococcus aureus (16.7%) or an association of both agents (61.1%). Resistance profile indicated that streptococcus and staphylococcus respond well to macrolids compared to other antibiotic groups.
