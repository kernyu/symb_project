The in vitro susceptibilities of 102 human campylobacter strains isolated between 1978 and 1980 and 100 strains isolated in 1990 to ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, and doxycycline were examined. The biotypes and heat-stable serotypes of the strains as well as antimicrobial treatments and travel history of the campylobacter-positive patients were also studied. The results indicated that susceptibility to erythromycin, gentamicin, and doxycycline has remained the same during the past 10 years. No gentamicin-resistant strains were found. Resistance to erythromycin was 3% in both groups of strains. However, the number of norfloxacin-resistant strains increased from 4 to 11% in the follow-up period, and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains, which had not occurred 10 years ago, composed 9% of the strains isolated in 1990. Thus, the increase of fluoroquinolone resistance in Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli has been significant in Finland in the past 10 years.
