A cross-section study was carried out to assess the general patterns in use of antimicrobial agents and the trends of bacterial resistance in Huashan Hospital. Of 2,400 patients whose charts were reviewed, 61% were given such drugs. 3,596 antibiotic courses were prescribed. Gentamicin was most frequently used. Results of the susceptibility test of 320 bacterial strains showed a high percentage of resistance against gentamicin, ampicillin, and chloramphenicol. Our findings suggest that antibiotic policies in the hospital need reappraising.
