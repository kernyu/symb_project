From 1979 to 1982, 606 strains of Salmonella have been isolated in the Laboratories of the CHU of Dakar, Senegal. The endemics serotypes are S. typhi (73%), S. enteritidis (5% and S. typhimurium (5%). Among the epidemics serotypes of Salmonella, the more commonly isolated is S. ordonnez (10%). These four serotypes represented 93% of the strains of Salmonella. Seventy per cent of the strains had been isolated from patients aged under less than twenty years. The epidemic serotypes provide essentially from infant. Five antibiotics among the eighteen tested, have inhibited 100% of Salmonella. A multiresistance to more than five antibiotics have been observed for sixty four strains (11%). Some strains of S. typhi (4%) are resistant to the chloramphenicol and three of them were multiresistants; this may result from the transfer of plasmidic's resistance of multiresistant epidemics serotypes Salmonella circulating in Dakar. In Senegal, periodics studies of the epidemiology of Salmonella are justified.
