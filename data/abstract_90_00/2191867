In a controlled, randomized trial of 133 patients with proven urinary tract infections (UTIs), significantly more pathogens were found to be susceptible to norfloxacin than to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) (p less than 0.01). Among patients with pathogens susceptible to both drugs, more of those treated with norfloxacin were cured or improved (p = 0.06). When at least one patient variable, i.e., prior history of therapy, was corrected for, this difference became significant (p = 0.03). Norfloxacin eradicated 11 of 13 infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 6 of 7 due to enterococci. Five patients treated with norfloxacin and two treated with TMP-SMZ had relapses within 6 weeks. Significantly fewer adverse experiences occurred in patients receiving norfloxacin (p less than 0.01).
