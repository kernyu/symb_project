The morphological responses of primary bovine bronchial epithelial cells (BBECs) cultured in serum-free medium to protein activators have been examined. When attached to type I collagen-coated tissue culture dishes, the cells responded to tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA), calcium ionophore A23187, and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) by extruding filopodia. In contrast, no morphological changes were elicited by exposures to either epinephrine or dibutyryl-cAMP. Formation of filopodia was accompanied by actin filament reorganization as demonstrated by staining with labeled phalloidin. Exposures to varied TPA concentrations for 2 h showed maximal stimulation of filopodial extrusions at 10 nM TPA with half-maximal stimulation at 1 nM. Time-course measurements with 10 nM TPA showed filopodia formation within 30 min of exposure, with 85% of the BBECs being filopodia positive after 5 h. Filopodia induction in 20-30% of the cells could be achieved by 1-100 microM LPA concentrations. BBECs acquired increasing resistance to TPA-induced filopodia during the initial 5 days in culture; however, responsiveness to TPA was regenerated by mild treatment with trypsin. Inclusion of fibronectin or vitronectin into the attachment matrix had no effects on the rates or extent of TPA-induced filopodia formation.
