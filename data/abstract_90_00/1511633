Bacillus subtilis strain ATCC 6633 was examined for susceptibility to 30 additional antimicrobial drugs, the majority of which had been released during the 1980s. The data served to update previous findings with regard to the suitability of this assay strain for the detection of chemotherapeutic agents in fluid clinical specimens.
