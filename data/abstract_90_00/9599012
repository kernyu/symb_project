To exploit prokaryotic antioxidant enzymes for protection of animal cells from oxidative damage, we expressed catalase-peroxidase of cyanobacterium Synechococcus PCC 7942 in 104C1 cells. The gene for this enzyme was inserted into the mammalian expression vector pRc/CMV. The stable transfectants obtained had higher specific activities of catalase and as a result became more resistant to H2O2 or paraquat than the parental cells. Subcellular fractionation and immunoblot analysis revealed that the expressed catalase-peroxidase was confined to the cytosol; this localization may be the basis for the effective protection of the transfectants from the oxidative cell damage.
