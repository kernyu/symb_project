The in vitro antimalarial activities of 46 alkaloids and extracts from Strychnos species were evaluated. Two types of quasidimeric alkaloids exhibit high and selective activities against Plasmodium. Strychnopentamine and isostrychnopentamine were active against chloroquine-sensitive and -resistant strains (50% inhibitory concentration [IC(50)] approximately 0.15 microM), while dihydrousambarensine exhibited a 30-fold higher activity against the chloroquine-resistant strain (IC(50) = 0.03 microM) than it did against the chloroquine-sensitive strain.
