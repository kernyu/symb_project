The rise in the number of multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria that has occurred in recent years has resulted in the development of infections that are difficult to treat, and also in severely restricted treatment options. In particular, the incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has increased, with strains shown to cause up to 21% of skin infections and 59.6% of nosocomial pneumonia. Recently, strains of S. aureus with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin (glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus or GISA) are causing great concern, particularly as vancomycin has been the agent of choice in the treatment of infection caused by MRSA. GISA has been identified in Japan, the USA and Europe. New agents that have anti-MRSA activity are now being investigated. These include the novel streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin. This report examines the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against strains of S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, including multidrug-resistant MRSA and GISA.
