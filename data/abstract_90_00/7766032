Overproduction of TmrB protein, a 22.5-kDa protein with an N-terminal ATP-binding region and a C-terminal amphiphilic alpha-helix, confers resistance to tunicamycin on Bacillus subtilis. TmrB protein was found to bind Sepharose 6B to which tunicamycin was covalently linked. Experiments with mutant proteins found that the C-terminal region of TmrB protein might be involved in the binding to tunicamycin.
