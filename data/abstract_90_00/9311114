Bacillus cereus ATCC 10987 and ATCC 14579 can be induced to high levels of resistance to tetracycline. The chromosomal B. cereus gene bctl encodes a transmembrane protein with homology to Gram-positive tetracycline efflux proteins and relation to other members of the major facilitator superfamily of transport proteins. A mutant strain containing an insertionally inactivated bctl gene did not show impaired tetracycline resistance. No additional altered phenotype was observed in the mutant. Accumulation studies suggested that the resistance mechanism involves a reduced sensitivity to intracellular tetracycline.
