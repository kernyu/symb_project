A patient with deteriorating pulmonary melioidosis rapidly recovered after treatment with ceftazidime. To prevent possible relapses, an oral maintenance regimen of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid was prescribed for a period of three months. Melioidosis is caused by Pseudomonas pseudomallei. It is an insidious disease because of its variable clinical presentation, possible long-term asymptomatic carriage, broad-spectrum resistance to first-line antibiotics, and high mortality rate. As in our patient, the diagnosis should be particularly considered when there is reduced immunologic resistance and previous exposure in endemic areas, such as Southeast Asia.
