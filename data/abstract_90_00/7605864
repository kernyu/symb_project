AIM: To compare H. pylori eradication rates using omeprazole in conjunction with either amoxycillin or clarithromycin. BACKGROUND: Omeprazole with amoxycillin is the most widely used dual therapy regimen for eradication of H. pylori. A recent open study suggested a high eradication rate combining omeprazole with the newer macrolide, clarithromycin. METHODS: A randomized prospective trial in 54 patients was conducted to compare 2 weeks of treatment with omeprazole 40 mg once daily and either amoxycillin 500 mg three times daily or clarithromycin 500 mg three times daily. H. pylori eradication was assessed using the 13C urea breath test. RESULTS: Eradication was achieved in 18/26 (69.2%) of subjects treated with omeprazole and amoxycillin and 18/25 (72.0%) of those treated with omeprazole and clarithromycin (P = N.S.). Minor side effects, most commonly altered taste, were reported by 16% of patients and were more frequent in those randomized to clarithromycin (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These regimens are similarly effective. However, clarithromycin is more expensive, associated with a greater frequency of side effects and, unlike amoxycillin, resistance by H. pylori has been reported. This suggests that clarithromycin may be a useful alternative when there is penicillin allergy or previous treatment failure, but it should not replace amoxycillin as first choice in omeprazole-based dual therapy.
