A patient with a history of alcohol abuse and pancreatitis presented with a pleural effusion resulting from a fistula between the pancreatic duct and left pleural space. Two weeks into her hospitalization, fever and persistent bloodstream infection with Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae and Candida albicans developed. The patient had no history of exposure to animals. To our knowledge this is the first report of an E. rhusiopathiae infection presenting during hospitalization. This case suggests the possibility of a carrier state of infection and illustrates that a high index of suspicion is necessary for identification of unusual pathogens in hospitalized patients.
