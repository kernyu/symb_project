Loading pigs onto trucks and transporting them for 30 min resulted in a significant increase in proportion of antimicrobial resistance of gram-negative enteric bacteria in fecal material. Similarly, the mean number of antimicrobial agents in the resistance patterns of these bacteria increased during loading and transportation. However, the increases were of a transient nature, as resistance values were similar to those of a nontransported control group 1 day after the pigs had been transported.
