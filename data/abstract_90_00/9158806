Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) collected between July 1991 and February 1994 were tested in vitro against RP 59500 and ramoplanin using agar dilution and standard macro broth dilution procedures. Colony counts were determined at 0, 4, and 24 h. RP 59500 had an MIC range of < or = 0.5-8 micrograms/ml with an MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml and a MBC range of < or = 0.5-16 micrograms/ml with an MBC90 of 16 micrograms/ml. Ramoplanin had an MIC range of < or = 0.125-1 microgram/ml with an MBC range of < or = 0.125-4 micrograms/ml. The MIC90 for ramoplanin was 1 microgram/ml and the MBC90 was 4 micrograms/ml for the tested isolates. Against these isolates of E. faecium, RP 59500 was bactericidal at 8x MIC, a potentially achievable level using a high drug dosage. Ramoplanin was bactericidal at 2x MIC.
