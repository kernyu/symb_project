Plasmids of 70MDa from 6 Shigella sonnei isolates originating in Kaohsiung, Taiwan were found. All of them encoded resistance to chloramphenicol and tetracycline. These plasmids belonged to the H II incompatibility group. The fertility inhibition property of plasmids was the fi- type. Restriction endonuclease analysis revealed the six plasmids all had identical restriction patterns with BamH I, Hind III and Nru I. All six plasmids carried the type I chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene and the class B tetracycline resistance gene as determined by Southern hybridization with DNA probes of various antimicrobial resistance genes. The results demonstrated that S. sonnei isolates harboured the same R plasmid.
