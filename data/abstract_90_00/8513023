Forty-three strains of Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, isolated from pigs with chronic swine erysipelas, were examined for the presence of plasmid DNA by agarose gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy. Seven of these strains were found to contain plasmids of which number were varied from 1 to 6. The plasmids ranged from 1.4 to 86 kb in size. This is the first reported evidence for plasmid DNA in E. rhusiopathiae. The functions of the plasmids are unknown at present.
