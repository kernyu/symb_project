The lymphokine production by pregnant mice infected with a lethal dose of Toxoplasma gondii was evaluated in comparison with that by virgin mice infected with a sublethal dose of this protozoan parasite. Splenocytes taken from mice before and on the day after infection produced considerable amounts of IL-2 in response to concanavalin A (Con A) stimulation, but the titers rapidly declined in both pregnant and virgin mice as infection progressed. A trace amount or undetectable level of IL-2 was produced by splenocytes from acutely infected mice when stimulated with Toxoplasma lysate antigen (TLA). In contrast to the kinetics of IL-2 production, the levels of IFN-gamma produced by splenocytes cultured with Con A or TLA increased steadily in the later stage of infection in both pregnant and virgin mice. Thus, the response to Con A or TLA of splenocytes to produce IL-2 and IFN-gamma differed strikingly in acute toxoplasmosis in mice. The administration of rHuIL-2 resulted in a significant decrease in the mortality of pregnant mice infected with a lethal dose of Toxoplasma. The combination of rHuIL-2 and rMuIFN-gamma increased the survival rate slightly but not significantly compared with pregnant mice receiving either rHuIL-2 or rMuIFN-gamma. Moreover, exogenously administered rHuIL-2 enhanced the production of both IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma in the bloodstreams of pregnant mice, in accordance with the decreased mortality. These results indicate that IL-2 may play a significant role in modulating the host defense against Toxoplasma infection in pregnant mice.
