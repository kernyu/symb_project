Transposon Tn1545 was introduced into the chromosome of the ruminal cellulolytic bacterium Eubacterium cellulosolvens. This was achieved by conjugal transfer of the transposon from Clostridium beijerinckii at a frequency of about 1 per 10(4) recipient cells. Transconjugants of E. cellulosolvens were resistant to both tetracycline and erythromycin. E. cellulosolvens could also serve as a donor for conjugal transfer of Tn1545 back into C. beijerinckii.
