Acute otitis media (AOM) and otitis media with effusion (OME) in children can present with a variety of middle ear effusions (MEE). Even though the character of the effusion may vary, the underlying pathogenesis is often similar. In the last decade, there has been an abundance of new information in the fields of immunobiology and immunochemistry to explain the chronicity of MEE. There are also studies examining the efficacy of vaccination and immunoprophylaxis for recurrent AOM. Diagnosis of otitis media (OM) in a child can be difficult but good visualization by pneumatic otoscopy improves the accuracy of diagnosis of OME. The development of increasing bacterial resistance to antimicrobial therapy reinforces the need to be more rational in treating AOM and OME. The variability of the natural history and the long term sequelae of OME makes medical management more difficult. All children with chronic MEE should have audiologic evaluation. Surgery is recommended should the condition be refractory to medical therapy or if the complications of MEE develop.
