Three different strains of Haemonchus contortus (susceptible to ivermectin, S-IVM; selected for resistance to ivermectin, R-IVM; a multiple resistant strain, i.e. resistant to benzimidazole and ivermectin, R-IVM/SA) were examined for isoenzyme variation by starch gel electrophoresis. Using stains for seven enzymes separated in five different buffer systems, no differences in the electrophoretic mobility could be detected between any of the strains. Results demonstrate a low level of enzyme variation in H. contortus and no differences in enzyme electrophoretic profile between IVM-sensitive and IVM-resistant parasites. Differences between the ivermectin-sensitive and both ivermectin-resistant strains were observed with the propionyl esterases and although some of the differences are probably associated with benzimidazole resistance, others are associated with resistance to ivermectin. The three strains of H. contortus are generally identical; however, differences between all strains of H. contortus and a strain of Dictyocaulus viviparus were detected.
