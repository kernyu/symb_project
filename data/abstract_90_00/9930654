Gelsolin, an 80 kDa actin-severing protein, has been recently identified as a substrate for the cell death-promoting cysteinyl protease caspase-3 (CPP32/apopain/YAMA). We investigated the role of gelsolin and its cleavage product in apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) induced by the proinflammatory cytokines interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Treatment with a combination of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha reduced viability of SMC in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Immunoblotting revealed that SMC treated with the cytokines generated a 41 kDa gelsolin fragment. The gelsolin fragmentation required activation of caspase-3, as the caspase-3 inhibitor diminished cytokine-induced cell death as well as the fragmentation. Gelsolin cleavage was accompanied by a reduction in F-actin content and by a marked disruption of cell structure. Adenovirus-mediated transfection of this N-terminal gelsolin fragment into SMC altered cell morphology, reduced cell viability, increased the number of TUNEL-positive cells, and promoted internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Compared to wild-type cells, gelsolin-deficient SMC showed resistance to apoptosis induced by the inflammatory cytokines. These results suggest a mechanistic role for gelsolin cleavage during SMC apoptosis, a process implicated in vessel development as well as stability of atherosclerotic plaque.
