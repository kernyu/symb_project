We evaluated combined effects of sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ) with each of imipenem/cilastatin (IPM), cefuzonam, flomoxef, amikacin (AMK) and tobramycin (TOB) against 324 clinical strains. Through this study, we obtained the following results. 1. Against Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter cloacae, good synergism was obtained by combining SBT/CPZ with IPM, AMK, or TOB. 2. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, good synergism was obtained by combining SBT/CPZ with AMK or TOB. 3. When SBT/CPZ was used in combination with IPM, antagonism was observed among about 45% of strains of P. aeruginosa.
