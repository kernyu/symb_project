Surveillance of antibiotic resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae showed a decrease in the percentage of beta-lactamase-producing isolates but an increase in intermediately penicillin-resistant strains and strains resistant to a high level of tetracycline. MICs for the ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates that emerged increased, and these isolates had mutations in gyrA and parC similar to those observed in the Far East.
