Stepwise increases in methotrexate (MTX) concentration over a 4-year period led to the selection of a highly drug-resistant (2 x 10(-4) M MTX) Drosophila cell line. Uptake experiments with [3H]MTX showed a slightly lower level of intracellular MTX in the resistant S3Mtx cells than in the susceptible S3 parental cell line. Southern blot analysis demonstrated that the gene for the MTX target, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), was not significantly amplified in the resistant line. To determine the molecular basis for resistance, the DHFR cDNA sequence was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from both the resistant and susceptible cells. Sequence comparison revealed a single T to A base change at nucleotide 89, which resulted in the substitution of Gln for Leu at residue 30 in S3Mtx cells. Expression and purification of the wild-type and mutant DHFR from E. coli cells showed that the S3Mtx enzyme had a reduced binding affinity for the antifolates, MTX and trimethoprim, with 15-fold higher K[d] and K[i] values than those from the wild-type enzyme. Molecular modeling confirmed that the replacement of the hydrophobic Leu by the more polar Gln was in the substrate binding site and thus would decrease the binding of MTX. These results suggest that the high level of MTX resistance in the selected cell line can be attributed to the mutation in the DHFR gene and also provides a model for pesticide resistance in insects.
