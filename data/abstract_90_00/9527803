Three hundred and thirty-three Shigella isolates obtained in 1986 to 1995 were tested for their susceptibilities to 19 antimicrobial agents. Nalidixic acid resistance had emerged in 59.6% of Shigella flexneri isolates during 1994 to 1995, with all tested resistant isolates having the mutation in gyrA encoding the Ser-83 alteration. Multiresistance (resistance to four or more agents) was more common in S. flexneri than in Shigella sonnei.
