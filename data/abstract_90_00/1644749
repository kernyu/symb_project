TEM-1 beta-lactamase is the most prevalent plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase in gram-negative bacteria. Recently, TEM beta-lactamase variants with amino acid substitutions in the active-site pocket of the enzyme have been identified in natural isolates with increased resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins. To identify other amino acid substitutions that alter the activity of TEM-1 towards extended-spectrum cephalosporins, we probed regions around the active-site pocket by random-replacement mutagenesis. This mutagenesis technique involves randomizing the DNA sequence of three to six codons in the blaTEM-1 gene to form a library containing all or nearly all of the possible substitutions for the region randomized. In total, 20 different residue positions that had been randomized were screened for amino acid substitutions that increased enzyme activity towards the extended-spectrum cephalosporin cefotaxime. Substitutions at positions 104, 168, and 238 in the TEM-1 beta-lactamase that resulted in increased enzyme activity towards extended-spectrum cephalosporins were found. In addition, small deletions in the loop containing residues 166 to 170 drastically altered the substrate specificity of the enzyme by increasing activity towards extended-spectrum cephalosporins while virtually eliminating activity towards ampicillin.
