OBJECTIVES: To describe the population in whom bloodstream infections with vancomycin-resistant enterococci occur and the clinical and microbiologic features of infection. METHODS: From June 1, 1991, to January 31, 1994, 73 patients with bloodstream infections with vancomycin-resistant enterococci were identified by retrospective review of hospital charts and microbiology records. RESULTS: Fifty-two (73%) of 71 patients with evaluable data were hospitalized in an intensive care, unit, the adult oncology unit, or the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome unit. Before the development of the bloodstream infection with vancomycin-resistant enterococci, patients were hospitalized and received antibiotics for a median of 26 and 25.5 days, respectively. A hematologic malignancy, respiratory failure, or renal failure requiring dialysis was present in 59 patients (83%). Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores of the patients ranged from 6 to 35 (median, 17). Forty-five (63%) of the patients died. Compared with 37 patients who had only a single positive blood culture, the 34 patients with 2 or more blood cultures positive for vancomycin-resistant enterococci more often were neutropenic or had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (74% vs 35%; P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Bloodstream infections with vancomycin-resistant enterococci predominantly affect severely ill patients who have received extensive antibiotic treatment during a prolonged hospitalization. Immunocompromised patients are more likely to have a persistent blood-stream infection with vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
