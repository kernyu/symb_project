In this study the susceptibility of 91 methicillin-resistant and -susceptible Staphylococcus intermedius strains (MRSI and MSSI, respectively) against 15 antimicrobial agents was determined. The activity of the antimicrobial agents was studied at pH 7.2 and pH 8.5. Methicillin was more active at pH 7.2 (28 strains methicillin-resistant) than at pH 8.5 (55 strains methicillin-resistant). Gentamicin showed excellent activity, with only 3 strains resistant at pH 8.5. However, gentamicin would have to be administered parenterally. Oxytetracycline cannot be recommended for treatment of canine staphylococcal dermatitis, due to the high percentage (over 25%) of strains that were found to be resistant. Clindamycin showed little activity in inhibiting growth of the strains studied, the percent resistance at pH 7.2 was 93.4%. Rifampin behaved differently at the two pH values. However, a close relationship was noted between methicillin-resistant and rifampin-resistant strains, particularly at the lower pH. Of the fluoroquinolones, ciprofloxacin or enrofloxacin would be a good useful alternative for the treatment of methicillin-resistant strains of S. intermedius. Lastly, very high resistance to sulphamethoxypyridazine was found, as was the case with trimethoprim and a combination of trimethoprim/sulphamethoxypyridazine, against not only MRSI but also MSSI strains.
