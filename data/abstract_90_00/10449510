We described the molecular epidemiology of expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacilli (RGN) recovered from inanimate surfaces. RGN were isolated from 9% of environmental cultures. Numerous species, each with multiple unique strains, were recovered. Epidemiological links between environmental, personnel, and patient strains suggested the exogenous acquisition of RGN from the hospital environment.
