The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the relationship between carriage of antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A total of 554 pernasal swabs was taken during a six-month period from 554 adult patients attending three outpatient clinics and from inpatients from a hospital in Nairobi, Kenya. Overall, 121 swabs (22%) yielded Staphylococcus aureus, there being significantly higher carriage in HIV-positive patients (71/264, 27%) than in HIV-negative patients (50/290, 17%); p = 0.008. Antimicrobial resistance rates were determined for 110 isolates and were high for penicillin (91%) and tetracycline (72%) and low for erythromycin (8%), methicillin (3%), gentamicin (5%) and chloramphenicol (0%). Genetic analysis showed plasmids in the range of 24-42 MDa to be associated with beta-lactamase production and plasmids in the range of 3-5 MDa to be associated with resistance to tetracycline, erythromycin and trimethoprim. All nine erythromycin-resistant strains were from HIV-positive patients (p = 0.02). There was a significant association of tetracycline resistance with HIV seropositivity (p = 0.002). The association of HIV seropositivity with Staphylococcus aureus carriage and carriage of antibiotic-resistant strains against the background of the HIV epidemic are of relevance in individual patient care and raise concern for public health.
