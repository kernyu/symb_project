Four patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation were treated with liposomal (3 patients) and conventional (one patient) amphotericin-B for disseminated candidosis. Candida krusei was isolated from 3, and C. glabrata from 1 patient. The patients were treated with liposomal amphotericin-B in doses from 3 to 5 mg/kg. The fourth patient received conventional amphotericin-B in a reduced dose due to renal impairment. The patients died from multiorgan failure due to disseminated fungal infection. In 1 case, the switch to the conventional drug resulted in clearance before death. The 3 fungus isolates, together with the fourth strain obtained from patient no. 4 without any exposition to liposomal amphotericin-B were tested for their susceptibility to conventional, liposomal and discoidal amphotericin-B. All strains showed good sensitivity to the conventional and discoidal drug. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of liposomal amphotericin-B were 1 to 3 titre steps higher indicating a reduced sensitivity of the tested strains to this preparation. We conclude that the use of liposomal amphotericin-B is recommended mainly on the base of the low incidence of side-effects. Intensive microbial resistance tests, pharmacokinetic investigations and randomized studies are necessary before the conventional drug is replaced as the gold standard for systemic antimycotic therapy.
