Four Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates (LB1, LB2, LB3, and LB4) with increased antimicrobial resistance were obtained from the same patient. The four isolates were indistinguishable in biotype, plasmid content, lipopolysaccharide, and DNA analysis by pulse-field gel electrophoresis. Isolate LB1 made TEM-1 and SHV-1 beta-lactamases. Isolates LB2, LB3, and LB4 produced SHV-5 in addition to TEM-1 and SHV-1. MICs of cefoxitin, ceftazidime, and cefotaxime against LB1 were 4, 1, and 0.06 micrograms/ml, respectively. MICs of ceftazidime against K. pneumoniae LB2, LB3, and LB4 were > 256 micrograms/ml, and those of cefotaxime were 2, 4, and 64 micrograms/ml, respectively. MICs of cefoxitin against K. pneumoniae LB2 and LB3 were 4 micrograms/ml, but that against K. pneumoniae LB4 was 128 micrgrams/ml. K. pneumoniae LB4 could transfer resistance to ceftazidime and cefotaxime, but not that to cefoxitin, to Escherichia coli. Isolate LB4 and cefoxitin-resistant laboratory mutants lacked an outer membrane protein of about 35 kDa whose molecular mass, mode of isolation, resistance to proteases, and reaction with a porin-specific antiserum suggested that it was a porin. MICs of cefoxitin and cefotaxime reverted to 4 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively, when isolate LB4 was transformed with a gene coding for the K. pneumoniae porin OmpK36. We conclude that the increased resistance to cefoxitin and expanded-spectrum cephalosporins of isolate LB4 was due to loss of a porin channel for antibiotic uptake.
