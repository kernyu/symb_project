Effect of trifluoroacetoprimaquine oxalate (M8506) and primaquine (PQ) on blood schizonts of Plasmodium berghei were determined using the method of 4-day suppressive test within extended observation period of 60 d. When mice infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA strain were treated ig with M8506 or PQ at a same daily dose of 20 mg/kg for 4 d, the cure rates were 100% and 90%, respectively. The two drugs also showed prominent suppressive effects on chloroquine-resistant P. berghei NS line and pyronarine-resistant P. berghei RP line, but the parasitemia still remained positive or all of the mice treated recrudesced, indicating the existence of cross resistance between trifluoroacetoprimaquine and other erythrocytic schizonticides, including chloroquine and pyronaridine.
