An experiment was undertaken to determine the effect of salinomycin on Giardia in vitro and on Giardia and coccidia in growing lambs. Concentrations of salinomycin above (3.9 micrograms/mL) reduced the adherence (index of viability) of Giardia S2 trophozoites by more than 50%. This strain did not develop resistance after repeated exposure to sublethal concentrations of salinomycin. Five of 40 lambs escaped natural infection by Giardia, and these were inoculated with > or = 500,000 cysts. Giardiasis (presence of cysts in feces) was confirmed in all lambs before commencement of the experiment. Coccidiosis (presence of oocysts) developed by natural exposure. Lambs were assigned randomly to diets containing 0, 4, 10, or 16 ppm of salinomycin. Giardia cyst and coccidia oocyst excretions were determined on 6 d during the first week and weekly thereafter. Giardia cysts were detected at each sampling date in all treatments (highest release, 2.3 x 10(6) cysts/g feces). The number of Giardia cysts shed in feces was not affected (P > .05) by salinomycin but did decline (P < .05) with time. Average infection rates remained above 50% until d 41 of the experiment and declined linearly (P < .05) with salinomycin concentration and time. The number of coccidia oocysts in feces was low (highest release, 6.8 x 10(4) oocysts/g feces), but shedding occurred in 38 of the 40 lambs. Treatment with salinomycin had a cubic effect (P < .05) on coccidia oocyst excretion, and no oocysts were detected beyond d 28. Treatment effect on average daily gain (P < .002), dry matter intake (P < .02), and final live weight (P < .07) was cubic, whereas carcass weight (P < .003) and dressing percentage (P < .08) were linearly affected by salinomycin concentration. Although a beneficial effect of 10 ppm salinomycin on lamb performance was apparent, the development of natural resistance makes it difficult to attribute this response to the control of coccidiosis or giardiasis.
