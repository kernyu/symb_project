Antimicrobial resistance is becoming increasingly important in the treatment of enteric infections, particularly those due to Shigella, Vibrio cholerae, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (associated with traveler's diarrhea), and Salmonella typhi. The rate of antimicrobial resistance is highest in the developing world, where the use of antimicrobial drugs is relatively unrestricted. Of greatest immediate concern is the need for an effective, inexpensive antimicrobial that can be used safely as treatment for small children with dysentery due to Shigella, primarily Shigella dysenteriae type 1.
