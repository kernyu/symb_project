The effect of verapamil, a multidrug-resistance (Mdr)-reversing agent on the absorption of a pour-on formulation of ivermectin was evaluated in rats. Absorption of ivermectin was effectively enhanced (40%) by the presence of verapamil, suggesting that absorption of ivermectin involves Mdr-P-glycoprotein and that verapamil should act as a competitive inhibitor for the transport and extrusion of ivermectin by P-glycoprotein. This hypothesis is consistent with other studies describing verapamil as a blocking agent of P-glycoprotein involved in the efflux of ivermectin in a resistant strain of Haemonchus contortus.
