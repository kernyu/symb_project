Cytomegalovirus (CMV) polyradiculopathy is a rare complication of AIDS in which ascending motor weakness, sensory loss and urinary retention are associated with polymorphonuclear pleocytosis and positive CMV polymerase chain reaction in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We describe three patients with this syndrome. One patient's paresis improved after ganciclovir therapy. Another patient deteriorated despite foscarnet treatment, but improved after ganciclovir was added. The third patient died from ascending paralysis despite ganciclovir-foscarnet combination. Reviewing the literature, we conclude that antiviral treatment reduced mortality from 100 to 22%. In patients with ascending paralysis treatment, failure may be caused by viral drug resistance, at least in some patients. Risk factors for treatment failure are preceding monotherapy for other CMV diseases or persistent CSF pleocytosis on serial CSF analysis. We suggest that these patients should therefore be treated with the alternative drug or a ganciclovir-foscarnet combination therapy.
