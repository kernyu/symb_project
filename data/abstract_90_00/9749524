To understand the coordinated functions of the different classes of defense-related genes expressed in plant disease resistance, the expression patterns of pathogenesis related (PR) protein genes and genes involved in antioxidation and the production of secondary metabolites were examined. The expression patterns of the respective defense-related genes were monitored following TMV infection or salicylic acid treatment. Northern blot analyses showed that PR genes such as PR-1, beta-1,3-glucanase and chitinase were strongly induced in tobacco leaves upon TMV infection or salicylic acid treatment. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGR) and phenylalanine ammonialyase (PAL), involved in isoprenoid and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, respectively, were mildly induced at the late stage of normal hypersensitive response (HR) or after salicylic acid treatment when compared with the PR-gene expressions. However, in acute HR, they were strongly expressed at the early stage. Interestingly, the expression of the antioxidative genes, anionic peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase, were inversely expressed following TMV infection and salicylic acid treatment. Differential expression of 3 groups of genes involved in plant defense responses are discussed in relation to different signal transduction pathways.
