The mef(A) gene from a clinical isolate of Streptococcus pneumoniae exhibiting the M-type resistance to macrolides was found to be part of the 7,244-bp chromosomal element Tn1207.1, which contained 8 open reading frames. orf2 encodes a resolvase/invertase, and orf5 is a homolog of the macrolide-streptogramin B resistance gene msr(SA).
