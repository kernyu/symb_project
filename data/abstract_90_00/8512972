BACKGROUND: References about isolation of strains of Salmonella typhi multiply resistant to antimicrobials and native from Spain are very scant. We describe here two cases of typhoid fever produced by two identical strains of Salmonella typhi. Both strains are multiresistant and autochthonous, judging from epidemiological investigations. METHOD: Microbiological diagnosis was made by means of isolation of causative microorganism from blood and stool, in the first case, and only from stool, in the second one. Antimicrobial susceptibility was ascertained using a minimal inhibitory concentration micromethod. RESULTS: Identification of Salmonella enterica ser. typhi and determination of its resistance to many antimicrobials. Native origin of both strains verified by means of epidemiological investigation. Healing achieved in both cases with ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: We stand out the rarity of isolating native multiresistant strains of Salmonella typhi in our country, as well as the great epidemiological interest of our finding. We think that diagnosis of these diseases must be made by culturing suitable specimens and isolating causal microorganisms, what will us to determine antimicrobial susceptibility. Finally, we emphasize the resolution of the illness with ciprofloxacin. We consider that this third generation quinolone is a suitable alternative in these cases.
