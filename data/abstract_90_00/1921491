Imipenem is the first of a new class of beta-lactam antibiotics, the carbapenems, to be released for clinical use. It has the broadest antibacterial activity of all antibiotics available for systemic use in humans. It is active against streptococci, methicillin-sensitive staphylococci, Neisseria, Haemophilus, anaerobes, and the common aerobic gram-negative nosocomial pathogens including Pseudomonas. Resistance to imipenem may emerge during treatment of P. aeruginosa infections, as has occurred with other beta-lactam agents; P. maltophilia and P. cepacia are typically resistant to it. Like the penicillins, imipenem has inhibitory activity against enterococci. Daily doses may range from 500 mg to 1 g, every 6 to 8 hours, in patients with normal renal function. The principal toxic effects have been nausea and vomiting, which occur during intravenous infusion, and seizures, which develop in 1 to 3% of treated patients and are likely to occur in the setting of renal insufficiency and underlying disease of the central nervous system. Imipenem should be considered for treatment of mixed bacterial infections and treatment of resistant aerobic gram-negative bacteria that are not susceptible to other beta-lactam agents. In addition to provoking unnecessary toxicity, indiscriminate use of this agent will promote dissemination of resistance against it.
