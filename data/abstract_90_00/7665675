Forty-eight clinical isolates identified as either Enterococcus faecium or Enterococcus faecalis with the MicroScan system (Dade International, MicroScan Inc., West Sacramento, Calif.) were further characterized by two supplementary biochemical tests (pigment production and motility). Twenty isolates (42%), all initially identified as E. faecium, were motile. Of these 20, 8 isolates (17%) produced yellow pigment and were identified as Enterococcus casseliflavus and the remaining 12 (25%) were nonpigmented and were identified as Enterococcus gallinarum. Identical identification results were obtained when PCR amplification of regions of the vanC gene was used as a technique for differentiating these organisms. The results of this study indicate that motility and pigment production tests together with commercial test systems are sufficient for reliable identifications of E. faecium, E. casseliflavus, and E. gallinarum.
