Tobramycin and dioxidine sensitivity of 57 strains belonging to 14 actinomycetes genera was studied. The cultures of Streptomyces were much more sensitive to tobramycin than the cultures of rare genera. The majority of the Streptomyces cultures showed a high resistance to dioxidine (MIC greater than or equal to 50 micrograms/ml). At the same time the majority of the cultures of rare genera were inhibited by low concentrations of dioxidine (no more than 50 micrograms/ml). For isolation of actinomycetes from soil samples, tobramycin, dioxidine, ceftriaxone and novobiocin were used. Tobramycin added in a concentration of 10 micrograms/ml to the Gauze agar organic medium No. 2 promoted a 2-fold increase in detection of actinomycetes of the rare genera as compared to the control. It was especially favourable for detection of cultures belonging to Micromonospora, Amycolatopsis, Streptosporangium and Nocardiopsis. Dioxidine in concentrations of 10 and 50 micrograms/ml inhibited the growth of the cultures belonging to rare genera. Ceftriaxone in the same concentrations inhibited the growth of the cultures of both Streptomyces and the rare genera. Novobiocin favoured detection of the cultures belonging to Amicolatopsis and Micromonospora. Therefore, among the tested compounds tobramycin and novobiocin appeared to be the most useful selective agents for isolation of actinomycetes of rare genera.
