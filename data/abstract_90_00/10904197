Outbreaks of invasive infection caused by methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus occur in hospitals, long term care institutions, and in patients discharged from these settings. In contrast, epidemic S. aureus infection has not been reported in well persons in the community. Here, we describe a group of healthy young adults who resided in the same neighborhood and participated together in school sports, and who developed serious S. aureus infections within 3 weeks of each other, suggesting a true community outbreak. Timely use of molecular epidemiological tools, however, demonstrated that their illnesses were caused by unrelated bacterial strains.
