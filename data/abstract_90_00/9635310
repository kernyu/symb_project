PURPOSE: Fungal infections in HIV-infected individuals are associated with advancement of disease. In pediatric HIV infection, symptomatic children have a significantly higher incidence of clinical candidiasis and persistent drug-resistant candidiasis than do asymptomatic HIV-infected children. The purpose of this preliminary cytologic study was to determine the prevalence of fungal organisms in whole unstimulated saliva from children with vertically acquired HIV infection. METHODS: The subjects included 27 HIV-infected and 11 HIV-exposed, but uninfected, children. Whole unstimulated saliva was obtained for cytologic evaluation (hematoxylin and eosin, silver stains) with selected samples evaluated by electron microscopy. RESULTS: Yeast and hyphae were identified cytologically in 19% of HIV-infected (22% symptomatic HIV-infected, 11% asymptomatic HIV-infected) and 9% of HIV-exposed, but uninfected, children. Fungal organisms were found more frequently in HIV-infected with moderate (18%) and severe (27%) suppression. Fungi were more frequent with antiretroviral therapy (22%) vs no antiretroviral therapy (0%) and no antifungal therapy (20%) vs. antifungal therapy (7%). Yeast and hyphal fungal forms are more prevalent in symptomatic HIV-infection with moderate and severe suppression, and those receiving antiretroviral agents, but no antifungal medications. CONCLUSION: Fungal organisms in the saliva may reflect oral carriage or mucosal colonization, which may influence the development of clinically significant candidiasis in these immunocompromised children.
