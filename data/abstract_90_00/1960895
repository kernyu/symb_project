In the present study, we investigated how the recent clinical use of antibiotics have altered the antibiotic susceptibility of strains isolated from postoperative infections, especially Gram-negative rods. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, serogroup E strains accounted for about 20 per cent of postoperative infections, but were unable to be isolated from either the feces of patients on admission or from the appendix contents of patients with appendicitis. It therefore appeared that serogroup E strains were responsible for the nosocomial infections in our department. The strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa serogroup E, which we assumed to be nosocomial pathogens, acquired a high level of resistance to antibiotics soon after third-generation cephems became widely used. On the other hand, the antibiotic susceptibility of Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and the serogroups of Pseudomonas aeruginosa other than E, which were considered to originate from the bacterial flora of patients, did not vary throughout the several years of the study period.
