Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) represents 80% of adult acute leukemias. A standard-dose chemotherapy allows to obtain 52% to 72% of complete remission (CR). A major limitation for success in chemotherapy of AML is dominance of drug-resistant subpopulations of cells. Cytosine-arabinoside (Ara-C) is a basic drug in AML treatment. Myeloblasts resistance to Ara-C could be kinetic or pharmacological. The classical multidrug resistance (MDR) depends on presence in resistant myeloblasts ATP-dependent drug-efflux pump with ability to remove cytotoxic drugs from the cells. It is a product of MDR1 gene called P-glycoprotein (Pgp). Pgp is responsible for cell resistance to cytotoxic compounds of natural origin, such as anthracyclines, vinca alkaloids, epipodophyllotoxins, taxanes, colchicine and amsacrine. There were also identified not Pgp-dependent multidrug resistance mechanisms (non-Pgp MDR) in AML. All mentioned above drugs are involved but not taxol. Non-Pgp MDR depends on topoisomerase II alfa activity alterations, multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) expression and lung resistance-related protein (LRP) expression. Pgp positive AML patients have poorer complete remission (CR) rate, decreased remission duration and overall survival. Pgp expression is detected among 70% AML patients older than 55. The most promising drugs in circumventing classical MDR seems cyclosporin A (CsA) and cyclosporin D (SDZ PCS 833). They are successfully used in refractory and relapsed AML.
