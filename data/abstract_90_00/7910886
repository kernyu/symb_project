Azithromycin has antimalarial activity and favourable pharmacokinetic properties for a prophylactic antimalarial agent. We investigated the ability of azithromycin to prevent malaria in volunteers infected with a chloroquine-resistant strain of Plasmodium falciparum. 4 volunteers received oral azithromycin 500 mg followed by 250 mg daily for 7 further days. Subjects were infected on the third day of azithromycin. 3 subjects were protected compared with none of 15 controls. The volunteer not protected by azithromycin had unquantifiable plasma levels of azithromycin, probably because of poor absorption. Azithromycin could be a promising prophylactic agent for P falciparum malaria.
