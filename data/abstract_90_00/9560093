New materials and coatings are now being developed to resist permanent bacterial contamination of implanted medical devices. This study exposed several styles of middle ear ventilation tube materials and coatings to high concentrations of Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus. Electron microscopy was then used to evaluate these tubes' resistance to bacterial biofilm formations. Ionized, processed silicone tubes were the only tubes resistant to Pseudomonas adhesion. Tubes that were made of fluoroplastic or that were ionized processed were very resistant to Staphylococcus contamination when compared with untreated silicone or silver oxide-treated silicone. This study suggests that ionized, coated fluoroplastic would be a highly effective tube material in preventing bacterial biofilm contamination of implanted ventilation tubes.
