From 14 strains of S. typhimurium which were resistant to three cephalosporins (cephalexin, cefadroxil and sodium cefotaxime) the resistance plasmids were transferred to two different strains (Escherichia coli K12F-Lac-Rifr and S. typhimurium LT2). The plasmids were autotransferable and the donors as well as transconjugants showed high levels of MIC (80-320 micrograms/ml or more) against these antimicrobial agents. The resistance was demonstrated to be mediated by a 15 kilobase plasmid.
