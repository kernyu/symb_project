Induction of CD95 ligand (CD95-L) may contribute to drug-induced apoptosis in chemosensitive leukemias and solid tumors. Here we report that induction of CD95-L and apoptosis by doxorubicin in leukemic and neuroblastoma cells is regulated by the redox state and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Preincubation of chemosensitive cells with antioxidants such as N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) or glutathione (GSH), significantly reduced doxorubicin-induced apoptosis, hyperexpression of ROS, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) and upregulation of CD95-L expression. Doxorubicin-resistant cells exhibited higher levels of GSH in comparison to chemosensitive cells and were deficient in hyperproduction of ROS, loss of DeltaPsim and upregulation of CD95-L in response to cytotoxic drugs. Downregulation of intracellular GSH concentrations reversed deficient drug-induced hyperproduction of ROS and CD95-L upregulation. In addition, overexpression of Bcl-XL in CEM cells blocked doxorubicin-triggered ROS and CD95-L expression. These findings suggest that induction of CD95-L by cytotoxic drugs is modulated by the cellular redox state and mitochondria derived ROS.
