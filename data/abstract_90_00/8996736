A total of 312 clinical beta-hemolytic streptococcal isolates (Streptococcus pyogenes, group A = 63; Streptococcus agalactiae, group B = 145; group C = 50; group F = 27; group G = 27) were examined for susceptibility to 23 and 24 antimicrobial drugs with the Bauer-Kirby agar disk diffusion and the agar dilution method, respectively. Sheep blood Mueller-Hinton agar served as the reference medium. Wilkins-Chalgren agar supported optimal growth of group A and B, but not of all group C, F, and G streptococci. The group A streptococci were susceptible to all beta-lactam antibiotics, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, rifampin, teicoplanin, and vancomycin, but resistant to cotrimoxazole, fusidic acid, and, except for 2 strains, to fosfomycin. Resistance (R)/intermediate susceptibility (I) rates (R/I%) to ciprofloxacin (0/2%), ofloxacin (1/2%), erythromycin (1.6/0%), and clarithromycin (0/1%) were low. Higher resistance rates were noted with tetracyclines (doxycycline 23.8/15.9%; tetracycline 39.7/3.2%). Among the group B streptococcal isolates, one strain was resistant against oxacillin and of intermediate susceptibility to penicillin G and cefoxitin. All isolates were susceptible to teicoplanin and rifampin. Conversely, all group B isolates were resistant to cotrimoxazole and fusidic acid; 69% and 51% of these isolates were susceptible to fosfomycin and rifampin, respectively. R/I rates of the group B streptococcal isolates were low for ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin (0/0.7%), clindamycin (0.7/0%), erythromycin (1.4/ 3.5%), clarithromycin (1.4/0%), and chloramphenicol (0.7/0%). Resistance to tetracyclines was significant (doxycycline: 72.4/2.1%; tetracycline; 74.5/1.4%). Among the non-A, non-B beta-hemolytic streptococci, 2 group C strains were resistant to oxacillin and showed intermediate susceptibility to penicillin G. All isolates were susceptible to third and fourth-generation cephalosporins, imipenem, chloramphenicol, rifampin, teicoplanin, and vancomycin. R/I rates to the other antimicrobial drugs were: ciprofloxacin (3.9/1.9%), ofloxacin (2.9/1.9%), clindamycin (2.9/1%), erythromycin (5.8/0%), clarithromycin (3.8/2.9%), and cotrimoxazole (16.4/3.9%). Resistance against tetracyclines was more frequent (doxycycline: 18.3/2.9%; tetracycline: 20.2/6.7%). On the basis of various minor discrepancies between MIC and disk diffusion test results, it is proposed that the current NCCLS inhibition zone (diameter, mm) criteria indicative of intermediate susceptibility of beta-hemolytic streptococci be changed for the following antimicrobial drugs: ampicillin: 22-27 mm (only for group A and B beta-hemolytic streptococci); ciprofloxacin: 16-18 mm; clindamycin: 15-18 mm; doxycycline: 17-19 mm; tetracycline: 17-19 mm, and erythromycin: 14-19 mm.
