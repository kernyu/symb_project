A case-control study was done to evaluate factors associated with nosocomial infections by multiresistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MRPA). Results showed that MRPA was associated with the use of immunosuppressive and antimicrobial drugs. Five typing methods indicated that the MRPA infections were due to multiple strains rather than a single strain.
