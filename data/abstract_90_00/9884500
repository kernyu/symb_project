The purpose of our investigation was the detection of S. pneumoniae and the isolation frequency of PRSP/PISP from the patients of the area. 457 strains of S. pneumoniae were isolated from the clinical specimens which had been requested for cultivation from the individual general practitioners in the city. Screening of the PRSP/PISP in 457 strains was carried out with the oxacillin (MPIPC) disk method. The MIC (benezylpenicillin: PCG) was measured at the same time in 73 strains, and compared with the disk method. The results were as follows: 1) Regarding the detection rate of S. pneumoniae, nose discharge was the highest (11.4%) in all the specimens. 2) There was a greater number of isolation of S. pneumoniae in one year from November to March. Then it was scarce in August and September. This change in seasons was noted. 3) There were many 9-year olds and over-60 year olds in the age group of the patients in whom the S. pneumoniae was isolated. 4) All 30 strains where a 6 mm diameter was found when a MIC was compared with the MPIPC disk method were resistant (PRSP/PISP). All 20 strains with a > or = 20 mm diameter were sensitive (PSSP). But in the 23 strains which had a 7 mm -19 mm, 7 strains (30%) were PSSP, and 16 strains (70%) in the intermediate (PISP). 5) A diameter of 6 mm was found in 194 strains (42.5%) with the MPIPC disk method, among the 457 strains isolated from the clinical specimens. 141 strains (30.9%) were found with a diameter of 7 mm -19 mm and 122 strains (26.7%) with a diameter of > or = 20 mm. 6) More than 70% in PRSP/PISP were multiple antimicrobiotics resistant strains to PCG, EM and MINO. 7) The distribution of the serotype in PRSP/PISP was in the order of 19 type (41.3%), 23 type (21.7%), 6 type (13.0%). Moreover, it was in the order of 3 type (18.5%), 6 type (11.1%), 19 type (11.1%), and there were few 23 type (3.7%) for PSSP. The distribution of the serotype was different for PRSP/PISP and PSSP.
