In vitro killing by a new semisynthetic echinocandin, LY-303366, was characterized using clinical isolates of fluconazole-sensitive (Y58) and -resistant (Y180) Candida albicans as well as Candida glabrata (Y7) and Candida krusei (Y171). The 24-h kill curves for Y58 and Y180 demonstrated dose-independent killing of between 1 and 2 log10 with LY-303366 at concentrations of 0.1, 1, 10, 50, 100, and 1,000 times the MIC. Regrowth did not occur at 24 h with either C. albicans isolate at the aforementioned LY-303366 concentrations. At their MICs, LY-303366 and amphotericin B produced similar killing kinetics in cultures of Y58, Y180, Y7, and Y171, while all cultures exposed to fluconazole at its MIC demonstrated stasis or growth over 24 h.
