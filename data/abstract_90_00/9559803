The impact of bacterial adherence on antibiotic activity was analyzed with two isogenic strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis that differ in the features of their in vitro biofilm formation. The eradication of bacteria adhering to glass beads by amikacin, levofloxacin, rifampin, or teicoplanin was studied in an animal model and in a pharmacokinetically matched in vitro model. The features of S. epidermidis RP62A that allowed it to grow on surfaces in multiple layers promoted phenotypic resistance to antibiotic treatment, whereas strain M7 failed to accumulate, despite initial adherence on surfaces and growth in suspension similar to those for RP62A. Biofilms of S. epidermidis M7 were better eradicated than those of strain RP62A in vitro (46 versus 31%; P < 0.05) as well as in the animal model (39 versus 9%; P < 0.01).
