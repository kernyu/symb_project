In France, bacterial resistance monitoring in animals is based on a national network of local veterinary laboratories organised by CNEVA following two methodologies. As part of the epidemiological surveillance of Salmonella, LCHA in Paris has been receiving since 1969 most of the strains isolated from animals (sick and healthy carriers) but also from food, feed and environment. For many years sensitivity tests have been carried out on strains collected: animal ones, mainly from cattle and poultry, show multiple antibiotic resistance more frequently than those of food or environment. Taking into account of the importance of antibiotic resistance in E. coli and Salmonella isolated from sick calves, LPB in Lyon has set up since 1982 a national system for collecting and analysing antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of main bovine pathogens determined routinely by local veterinary laboratories. In order to ensure comparability and coherency of data from different laboratories it was necessary to introduce standard techniques and reference reagents. The major bacterial species being tested concern enteric, respiratory and mammary flora. This network is useful to detect new resistances. The resistant strains collected are useful to carry out studies on the mechanism of resistance and the efficacy of new molecules. Results constitute the basis of a real predictive epidemiology necessary to lay down a policy for rational use of antimicrobials in animal breeding and veterinary medicine.
