A study was undertaken to evaluate the potential risk of wound infection in cervical disk disease, the appropriateness of the current prophylactic regimen of intravenous cefazolin at Good Samaritan Hospital, and the increasing resistance of coagulase-negative staphylococci in nosocomial infections. In addition, the methodology used in three prior studies was used to verify that double-gloving is a more effective barrier to bacterial contamination than single-gloving and that topical streptomycin lavage is superior to constant irrigation with plain saline. No wound infections were documented in the 40 patients who underwent cervical disk surgery in a 12-month period. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species were the most common bacterial isolate, but only 20% were resistant to cefazolin. Of the 11 S. aureus isolates, 9 were sensitive to cefazolin and 2 were methicillin resistant. A remarkable 95% (114/120) of the intraoperative wound cultures were free of bacteria. In only 2 cases was there a serial increase in colonies of the same organism over the course of the operation. There was one positive glove culture--coagulase-negative Staphylococcus sensitive to cefazolin. The patient's skin was identified as the source of contamination in 3 intraoperative cultures of the wound and 2 cultures of the ambient operating room air. Neither individual biotyping of bacteria nor antimicrobial susceptibility testing uncovered any consistent source or pattern to account for the organisms in the surgical wound or ambient operating room air. Bacteria resistant to cefazolin were found in 36% of the intraoperative environmental cultures but in only 16% of the isolates from patients' skin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
