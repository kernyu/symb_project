Among 204 strains isolated from infected burn wounds of 188 patients in the years 1987-1989 resistance to methicillin and oxacillin was found in 116 Staphylococcus aureus strains (group A). They accounted for 56.6% of the isolates. These data were compared with those of 1815 strains isolated from surgical cases in which 901 were MORSA strains (group B). In both groups MORSA were tested for their sensitivity to 9 various antibiotics. They were most sensitive to vancomycin and cefamandole.
