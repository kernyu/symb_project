The in vitro activity of ABT773, a ketolide antimicrobial agent, was investigated and compared with those of seven other antibiotics. Type strains and 733 Gram-positive, Gram-negative and anaerobic isolates of clinical origin and four CHLAMYDIA: isolates were used. The activity of ABT773 was very similar to that of telithromycin, the other ketolide tested. The MIC(90) was < or = 0.5 mg/L for all bacteria examined except methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Haemophilus influenzae and BACTEROIDES: spp. The antichlamydial activity of ABT773 was greater than that of telithromycin, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. Neither an increase in the size of the inoculm nor the addition of human serum had any marked affect on the in vitro activity of ABT773.
