The taxonomy of the genus Cryptosporidium remains ambiguous, because the current criteria for speciation are insufficient to validate the 6-8 named species. Cross-transmission experiments have shown varying and conflicting results, and the limited genetic data available do not necessarily support currently proposed species designations. The reasons for this ambiguity lie with the ubiquitous nature of Cryptosporidium, probably infecting all vertebrates and variety of tissues therein, and the absence of reference strains with defined virulence attributes that can be linked to genetic markers for comparative analysis. The inability to classify oocysts or confidently to identify their origin, implicate oocysts from all sources as hazardous to humans. Another major issue is the unusual degree of resistance that Cryptosporidium has shown to antiprotozoan and antimicrobial agents. The intracellular but extracytoplasmic domain the parasite occupies is in itself a significant barrier to drug entry. In support of this we outline how the intracellular niche of this parasite differs from the related Apicomplexans, Plasmodium and Toxoplasma, and delineate why the feeder organelle membrane, rather than, or in addition to, the parasitophorous membrane, is the major portal of nutrient entry for Cryptosporidium. The broad conclusion is that anticryptosporidial agents will have to enter the parasite via the multiple apical membranes that camouflage the parasite, or via the host cell, possibly transported by vesicles to the feeder organelle membrane. This may have major implications for rational drug discovery and design.
