Integrative expression vector pST6 was developed for dicote plant transformation. The vector contains neomycin phosphotransferase gene under control of PNOS promoter which confers kanamycin resistance to transformed plant cells. The vector also includes expression cassette with strong constitutive 35S CaMV promoter for cloning of foreign genes. The human recombinant alfa interferon gene has been inserted into the expression cassette of pST6. Recombinant plasmid obtained was transferred into Agrobacterium tumefaciens cells, where the plasmid integrated into disarmed Ti plasmid pVG2260. Transgenic tobacco plants were obtained via transformation of leaf discs. It was determined that the interferon gene was inserted into plant genome. Transcription and translation of human interferon was observed in the plants transformed.
