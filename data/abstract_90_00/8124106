Malaria attacks by Plasmodium falciparum have been observed in the European population living in Burkina Faso despite the use of bednets and regular chemoprophylaxis. In some cases, the diagnosis has been difficult because of an absence of severe symptoms. In other cases, malaria attacks have been severe after a dangerous delay in diagnosis and start of treatment. Moreover, treatment using halofantrine has, on occasion, been followed by relapses a few weeks later. These facts put into question the advisability of the routine use of chemoprophylaxis in an area of endemic infection and increasing drugs resistance.
