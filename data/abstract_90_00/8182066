Glutathione transferase P1-1, normally very low in adult rat liver, is induced by a single intravenous dose of lead nitrate. In this transient induction, there are at least three sites of regulation or control. These are transcription, post-transcription, and post-translation. The increase in transcription is evident both by nuclear run-off analysis and by measurement of mRNA levels. The other two sites of control were seen in actinomycin D-treated animals in which RNA synthesis was inhibited by over 80%. Treatment with actinomycin D increases the stability of the mRNA and also somehow inhibits the conversion of a glutathione transferase protein to an enzymatically active form. These three sites offer possibilities for the study of mechanisms of control for this interesting enzyme that may play a role in chemical carcinogenesis and in drug resistance.
