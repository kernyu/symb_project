Hexadecylphosphocholine (HePC) is a new ether lipid analogue with remarkable antineoplastic activity in vitro and in vivo. As the precise molecular mechanism by which this substance and probably other ether lipids exert their biological effects is still not defined, we tried to approach this problem by generating a cell line resistant to the antiproliferative properties of HePC. This was successfully accomplished by slow adaptation over a period of 14 months, of the very sensitive human leukemia cell line HL60. HePC resistant HL60 cells (HL60R) tolerate 8- to 10-fold higher doses of HePC and are continuously cultured in medium containing 10 micrograms/ml of HePC. An immunophenotypic and karyotypic characterization of HL60 and HL60R cells showed only marginal differences between the two cell lines. Total phospholipids, total cholesterol, protein and vinyl ether lipid content were equal in both cells. A down-regulation of the ether lipid mass in HL60R of about 40% could reflect one mechanism of tolerance induction. Though HePC uptake in HL60R cells was significantly lower than in the parental line, steady state measurements of cellular HePC content revealed similar HePC content in the membranes at HePC concentrations that were cytotoxic for HL60 but did not affect HL60R. This observation indicates that uptake and cellular accumulation of HePC do not determine HePC resistance. The resistant HL60R cells also showed a considerable degree of cross-resistance to ether phospholipids ET-18-OCH3 and BM 41.440, suggesting a common mode of action for HePC and other ether lipid analogues.
