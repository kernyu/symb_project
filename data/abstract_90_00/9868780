In this study, internal size variations in the VanA gene cluster Tn1546, encoding resistance to glycopeptides, is described. Studies of previously uncharacterized size variations of an internal region, encoding the vanX and vanY genes of Tn1546, revealed that these variations were due to the presence of the IS sequence, IS1216V. This IS sequence has previously been found integrated in Tn1546. Integration of the IS1216V element created both deletions and a duplication in a non-essential region of Tn1546. In several isolates, the entire vanY gene was deleted, proving that this gene is non-essential for vancomycin resistance.
