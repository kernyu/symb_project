The activity of meropenem, a new carbapenem, as well as imipenem, ceftazidime, aztreonam, tobramycin, amikacin and ciprofloxacin against 18 strains of Xanthomonas maltophilia and 23 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to imipenem was tested. All strains of X. maltophilia were resistant to both penems. Ceftazidime, tobramycin and ciprofloxacin were the most active antimicrobial agents against this specie. 17% of imipenem-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa were sensitive to meropenem. Ciprofloxacin, amikacin and aztreonam were the most effective agents against these strains.
