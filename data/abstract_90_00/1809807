During the period of 1980-1990, 581 Proteus vulgaris strains were obtained in a general hospital. They were considered as the significant isolate in 0.6% of soft tissue infections, 0.6% of urinary tract infections and in 0.2% of bacteremic episodes. Sixty-three percent of the 393 tested strains showed resistance to ampicillin, cefazolin and cefamandole or cefuroxime. About 7% were susceptible to all beta-lactam drugs, and showed a very low beta-lactamase activity and 5% of the strains showed a phenotype of resistance including ampicillin, carbenicillin-ticarcillin, cefazolin and cefamandole or cefuroxime, and presented increased chromosomal beta-lactamase activity. Cefotaxime-resistance was detected in 2% of the isolates which appeared in the period 1987-1990.
