Hypertension is a frequent complication after organ transplantation in both children and adults and is a significant risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease and graft dysfunction. There are multiple mechanisms responsible for the development of posttransplant hypertension. In the precyclosporine era, chronic rejection was the most common cause. The introduction of cyclosporine A has increased the prevalence of hypertension in solid organ transplant recipients. Cyclosporine increases renal vascular resistance by causing vasoconstriction of the afferent arteriole. From a pathophysiologic point of view, a calcium channel blocker should be used as the initial therapy in patients with cyclosporine-associated hypertension. Hypertension needs to be treated aggressively in all transplant recipients in an attempt to minimize allograft and cardiovascular damage.
