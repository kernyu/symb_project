Our previous observations indicated that mutants partially resistant to IFN-gamma cytotoxicity were defective in the induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, (IDO). Two mutants highly resistant to IFN-gamma were isolated following a second round of mutagenesis. The resistance to IFN-gamma was inversely correlated with the inducibility of IDO in these mutants. Moreover, several other IFN-gamma responsive genes, including those encoding 2-5A synthetase, GTP cyclohydrolase and HLA-DR alpha, were also differentially altered in their expression upon INF-gamma treatment. IFN-gamma receptor gene expression was not changed nor was the binding of the receptor to IFN-gamma. Southern blot analysis failed to reveal any significant abnormality in the IDO gene structure in these mutants. We therefore suggest that these mutants are defective in the IFN-gamma signaling pathway and will be useful in further analysis of the biochemical mechanism of IFN-gamma activated gene expression in target cells.
