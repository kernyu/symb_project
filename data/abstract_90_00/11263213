The unilateral mucosal samples were taken from 42 patients and were cultured for bacteria. Meanwhile, the antimicrobial susceptibility was determined for 11 antibiotics and the beta-lactamase-producing bacteria(beta LPB) were examined. In 85.71% of all samples, bacterial growth was present. Anaerobic bacteria were present in 21.43% of cases. Predominant aerobic bacteria were alpha-hemolytic streptococci and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Predominant anaerobic bacteria were peptostreptococcus species and bacteroides species. The beta LPB were isolated from 40% patients, which were responsible for the resistance to some antibiotics. The antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that the antibiotics containing beta-lactamase inhibitor, third-generation cephalosporins and third-generation quinolones had good efficacy. Our findings indicated the bacterial infection may not play the key role in the development of chronic sinusitis and the bacterial infection may not play the key role in the development of chronic sinusitis and the resistance to some antibiotics due to the high prevalence of beta-lactamase production must be considered when the antibiotics therapy is taken.
