Sensitivity patterns of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pyogenes were studied prospectively in an outpatient population seeking medical advice for respiratory tract infections (RTI) in the Southern parts of Stockholm. In total, 3,214 nasopharyngeal and 1,907 throat swabs were cultured during January-February 1996. 32% of the patients had received antibiotics during the previous year. Reduced penicillin sensitivity in S. pneumoniae was rare (1.3%) and only seen in patients treated with antibiotics during the previous 4 months. Beta-lactamase production in H. influenzae was found in 13.4% of patients who had been treated with antibiotics during the last 4 months and in 7.9% of the others. No resistance (< 1%) to erythromycin was seen in S. pyogenes. In this population-based surveillance, the levels of resistance in common respiratory tract pathogens were thus low and correlated to previous antibiotic treatment. Strict indications for antibiotic treatment in uncomplicated RTI are advocated to maintain a low resistance rate. Penicillin is still the drug of choice in patients without frequent recurrences of RTI in a setting similar to the one studied.
