Resistance to new generation beta-lactam antibiotics in Gram-negative bacteria is increasing worldwide. This resistance is due to EBS enzymes in Klebsiella spp., and Type-I chromosomal enzymes in Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter, P. aeruginosa, Providencia, M. morganii and S. marcescens. In this study, the types of beta-lactamases in 16 Klebsiella spp. and 15 Enterobacter spp. which are resistant to newer beta-lactam antibiotics was investigated by isoelectric focusing. The results of the study showed that TEM-1 enzymes are prevalent in these isolates. pI (isoelectric point) values and antibiotic susceptibility test results suggest that there are EBS enzymes in Klebsiella spp., and Type-I enzymes in Enterobacter spp. These results have to be supported by further investigations.
