We compared, some fitness-related traits of benzimidazole resistant (rr) and susceptible (rS, SS) worms of Teladorsagia circumcincta, a gastrointestinal parasite of the small ruminants, under laboratory conditions. PCR was used to determine the genotypes (rr, SS, rS) and the fitness of each was compared within the same strain. There was no significant difference in egg production, development rate from egg to infective larvae stage, establishment of these larvae in the host or the survival of adult worms and infective larvae for the 3 genotypes. The same results were obtained for the establishment rate of larvae in the host and the production of infective larvae under conditions of strong competition between resistant and susceptible worms. The fact that there were no differences in fitness suggests that the installation of benzimidazole resistance in a worm population is irreversible. This agrees with field observations.
