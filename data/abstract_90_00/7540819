Molecular characterization of a streptomycin-dependent mutant of Mycobacterium tuberculosis revealed the presence of a novel mutation in the rrs gene encoding 16S rRNA. Insertion of an additional cytosine in the 530 loop of 16S rRNA, a region known to be involved in streptomycin susceptibility and resistance, was associated with streptomycin dependence.
