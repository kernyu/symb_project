The in vitro activity of trospectomycin against 97 clinical isolates of oral pigmented Bacteroides species was compared with the activities of five other antimicrobial agents. At 4 micrograms/ml, more than 90% of isolates were inhibited by trospectomycin. Overall, strains that produced beta-lactamase (n = 41) were more resistant to trospectomycin, penicillin G, cefoxitin, piperacillin, and tetracycline but not to clindamycin. In this study, trospectomycin had excellent in vitro activity against oral pigmented Bacteroides species.
