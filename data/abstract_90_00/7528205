The yeast TOR1 and TOR2 proteins were previously discovered as putative targets of the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin. Although their cellular function is unknown, they are predicted to be at least 215 kDa in size and possess a C-terminal phosphatidylinositol (PI) kinase-related domain. We previously identified a conserved Ser residue, within the PI kinase-related domain of both yeast TOR proteins (Ser1972 in TOR1; Ser1975 in TOR2), as being the site of missense mutations conferring dominant rapamycin resistance. The Ser1972/1975 residue of yeast TOR is conserved in mammalian TOR homologs. One possibility is that this residue is critical for a direct interaction between TOR and the FKBP12-rapamycin complex. There is very recent biochemical evidence for an interaction between mammalian TOR and FKBP12-rapamycin (Brown, E. J., Albers, M. W., Shin, T. B., Ichikawa, K., Keith, C. T., Lane, W. S., and Schreiber, S. L. (1994) Nature 369, 756-758; Sabatini, D. M., Erdjument-Bromage, H., Lui, M., Tempst, P., and Snyder, S. H. (1994) Cell 78, 35-43). Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we now have obtained genetic proof of a physical interaction between FKBP12-rapamycin and TOR and have demonstrated that this interaction requires the conserved Ser residue. We have found that a small fragment of wild-type yeast TOR2 spanning Ser1975 is capable of interacting with human FKBP12 in the presence of rapamycin, whereas an Arg1975 mutant fails to interact. This effect is dependent upon rapamycin and is antagonized by FK506.
