This study evaluated the microleakage resistance of various glutaraldehyde-containing dental adhesives in Class V preparations. The materials tested were Gluma Bond System (3 Step), Prisma Universal Bond 3, and Syntac. The Class V preparations extended just beyond the cemento-enamel junction of extracted human molars. The restored teeth were stored in tap water for 24 hours and then thermally stressed for 100 cycles. Marginal leakage was assessed by measuring the dye linear penetration. The results indicated that all three dentin bonding agents provided leak-proof seals under certain conditions. The sealing ability of the Gluma Bond System (3 Step) appeared to be significantly affected by the resin composite used in the restoration.
