Several polycationic peptides isolated from animals, plants, and bacterial species possess a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. A rat model was used to investigate the efficacies of two peptides, ranalexin and buforin II, in the prevention of vascular prosthetic graft infections. The effect of peptide-soaked collagen-sealed Dacron was compared to that of rifampin-soaked collagen-sealed Dacron in the rat model of graft infection caused by methicillin-susceptible rifampin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis and methicillin-resistant rifampin-susceptible S. epidermidis. Graft infections were established in the back subcutaneous tissue of 240 adult male Wistar rats by implantation of 1-cm(2) Dacron prostheses, followed by topical inoculation with 2 x 10(7) CFU of S. epidermidis. The study included a control group (no graft contamination), two contaminated groups that did not receive any antibiotic prophylaxis, two contaminated groups to which perioperative intraperitoneal cefazolin prophylaxis (30 mg/kg of body weight) was administered, six contaminated groups that received a peptide- or rifampin-soaked graft, and six contaminated groups that received a peptide- or rifampin-soaked graft and perioperative intraperitoneal cefazolin prophylaxis (30 mg/kg). The grafts were sterilely removed 7 days after implantation, and the infection was evaluated by using sonication and quantitative agar culture. Overall, the efficacies of the polycationic peptides against the methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant strains were not significantly different from that of rifampin. Nevertheless, the combinations of ranalexin- and buforin II-coated grafts with cefazolin treatment demonstrated efficacies significantly higher than that of the combination of rifampin-coated grafts and cefazolin treatment against the methicillin-resistant strain.
