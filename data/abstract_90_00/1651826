LY264826 a new naturally occurring glycopeptide inhibited 90% of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus at 1 micrograms/ml. LY264826 had similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci. The LY264826 MIC90 for Streptococcus pyogenes was 0.25 microgram/ml, twofold more active than vancomycin and twofold less active than teicoplanin. LY264826 was eightfold more active than vancomycin and twofold more active than teicoplanin against enterococci. LY264826 inhibited Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.25 microgram/ml and Listeria monocytogenes at 0.5 microgram/ml. Clostridium were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml of LY264826 and peptococci, peptostreptococci, and Fusobacterium were inhibited by less than 0.5 microgram/ml. Bacteroides species were LY284826 -resistant as were all Enterobacteriaceae, Flavobacterium, and Neisseria spp. Minimum bactericidal and inhibitory concentrations (MBCs and MICs) were within a dilution for S. aureus, S. pyogenes, and S. pneumoniae, but greater than or equal to 32-fold greater for enterococci.
