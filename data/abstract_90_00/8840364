Enterococci are the second most common cause of hospital-acquired infections, and drug resistance among these organisms is a growing problem. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) now account for 7.9% of the nosocomial enterococcal infections. There is no standard therapy for VRE. Although some agents have shown in vitro activity alone or in combination, including ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, novobiocin, teicoplanin, chloramphenicol, and rifampin, treatment options are limited to combinations of drugs with marginal efficacy against the pathogens. Quinupristin-dalfopristin is a new investigational agent with activity against gram-positive cocci, including VRE.
