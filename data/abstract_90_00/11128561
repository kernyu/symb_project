Oxacillin-resistant staphylococci are the most serious pathogens in chronic osteomyelitis and only glycopeptides have been shown to be efficacious against them. We assessed the safety and efficacy of a regimen of teicoplanin 400 mg/day i.m. as long-term treatment in outpatients with osteomyelitis. A total of 76 patients received teicoplanin. Twenty-five patients had chronic prosthetic osteomyelitis (20 hip) and 51 patients had osteomyelitis caused by osteo-synthesis devices. Oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in pure culture in 55 patients (72%). A total of 21 patients had polymicrobial infection with a total of 48 isolated strains. All patients were treated with teicoplanin 400 mg i.m. once-a-day alone or with other drugs for a minimum of 4 months. Only one patient had side effects requiring discontinuation of treatment. The teicoplanin dose was reduced to 200 mg/day i.m. in 2 patients to decrease creatinine clearance values. Seventy out of 76 patients were cured.
