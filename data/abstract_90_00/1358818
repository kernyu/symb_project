A hybrid hybridoma (quadroma), secreting antibodies with double specificity to alpha-endorphin (alpha-EP) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP), has been produced. The bispecific antibodies constituted about 28-29% of all immunologically active IgG, produced by quadroma. The quadroma was isolated by fusion of two mouse hybridomas (anti-HRP and anti-alpha-EP) with distinct phenotypes: double mutant AMDR/HAT(S), and wild type (AMDS/HATR). A novel strategy for the construction of a double-mutant was applied, based on the use of an actinomycin D-resistant (AMDR) mouse myeloma for initiation of one of the parental hybridomas.
