Herpes simplex virus (HSV) requires the host cell secretory apparatus for transport and processing of membrane glycoproteins during the course of virus assembly. Brefeldin A (BFA) has been reported to induce retrograde movement of molecules from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum and to cause disassembly of the Golgi complex. We examined the effects of BFA on propagation of HSV type 1. Release of virions into the extracellular medium was blocked by as little as 0.3 microgram of BFA per ml when present from 2 h postinfection. Characterization of infected cells revealed that BFA inhibited infectious viral particle formation without affecting nucleocapsid formation. Electron microscopic analyses of BFA-treated and untreated cells (as in control cells) demonstrated that viral particles were enveloped at the inner nuclear membrane in BFA-treated cells and accumulated aberrantly in this region. Most of the progeny virus particles observed in the cytoplasm of control cells, but not that of BFA-treated cells, were enveloped and contained within membrane vesicles, whereas many unenveloped nucleocapsids were detected in the cytoplasm of BFA-treated cells. This suggests that BFA prevents the transport of enveloped particles from the perinuclear space to the cytoplasmic vesicles. These findings indicate that BFA-induced retrograde movement of molecules from the Golgi complex to the endoplasmic reticulum early in infection arrests the ability of host cells to support maturation and egress of enveloped viral particles. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the effects of BFA on HSV propagation are not fully reversible, indicating that maturation and egress of HSV type 1 particles relies on a series of events which cannot be easily reconstituted after the block to secretion is relieved.
