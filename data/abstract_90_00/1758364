A comparison of the efficacy of albendazole, medamine, and Vermox using an experimental model of Trichocephalus muris in DBA-2 mice showed that Vermox was most effective at all stages of the parasite development. The therapeutic activity of albendazole and medamine depends on daily dose, its dividing through the day and the duration of the treatment. At larval stages of T. muris complete recovery might be achieved using a daily dose of 25 mg/kg for albendazole and 150 mg/kg for medamine, but at the adult stage the doses of the drugs should be 3-4 times higher to achieve 100% effect. The resistance of T. muris to the drugs especially increases at the beginning of egg production.
