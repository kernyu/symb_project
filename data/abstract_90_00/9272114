An in vitro study of the combined cytotoxicity of either cisplatin (CDDP) or carboplatin and amphotericin B (AmB) was undertaken on a set of different ovarian carcinoma (IGROVI, IGROVI-C10, OAW42) and peritoneal malignant mesothelioma (CFB-CARP1) cell lines and ascitic cells freshly obtained from ovarian cancer patients so as to investigate the possibility of overcoming their resistance to platinum compounds. Growth-inhibition curves obtained 6 days after a 2-h period of exposure to the drugs showed that AmB at 5-10 mg/l allowed a 5- to 10-fold decrease in the 50% growth-inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of CDDP and carboplatin on either sensitive or resistant cells. Intracellular platinum assays with IGROVI cells showed that AmB acted by increasing dramatically the platinum uptake at a proportion that accounted for the increase in cytotoxicity. In the subline IGROVI-C10, a 10-fold resistant subline of IGROVI, AmB at 10 mg/l allowed recovery to the level of sensitivity seen in the parental cell line in the absence of AmB but not to the level observed in the presence of AmB. Acquisition of resistance mechanisms that are independent of the regulation of platinum uptake might be involved in this cell line. Thus, AmB might act by increasing the intracellular concentration of platinum without modifying the resistance mechanism involved downstream. However, in our models an increase in the intracellular level of platinum was always sufficient for the recovery of chemosensitivity in vitro. We also show that the phosphodiesterase inhibiting methylxanthines act synergistically with AmB. The latter drugs are weakly toxic and could also attenuate the nephrotoxicity of AmB.
