So far, P. aeruginosa has matched each new therapeutic advance with an antibiotic resistance or toxin move of its own. The result has been a persistently high mortality rate for Pseudomonas pneumonia, which is unacceptable. Further research to define aspects of the organism important in infection and to determine more effective treatment and prevention strategies are clearly needed.
