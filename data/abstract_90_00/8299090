BACKGROUND: Trimetrexate is an antifol that differs from methotrexate in ways that may be clinically important. Because methotrexate has activity in advanced bladder cancer, this trial was initiated. METHODS: Ambulatory patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma were treated with the nonclassic antifol trimetrexate at the intravenous dose of 8 mg/m2 daily for 5 consecutive days every 3 weeks (4 mg/m2 daily for 5 consecutive days for patients with creatinine levels greater than 1.6 mg/dl). RESULTS: Of the 48 patients in the study, one had a complete response and seven had partial responses, for an overall response rate of 17% (exact 95% confidence interval, 7-30%). The response rate in patients who had received prior methotrexate was 18%, suggesting lack of complete cross-resistance. Toxicity was manageable and primarily mucosal, gastrointestinal, and myelosuppressive. CONCLUSIONS: Trimetrexate has as much activity as other single agents in advanced urothelial carcinoma. Combination therapy, possibly with cisplatin, platinum analogs, or other antifols, using trimetrexate should be studied.
