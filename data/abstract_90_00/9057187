Despite the fact that alcoholism is one of the major causes of pancreatitis, the pathogenesis of this disorder remains obscure. Factors such as the pattern of ethanol consumption, diet, and genetic predisposition may be contributing factors. The failure to produce alcoholic pancreatitis in experimental animals suggests that experimental provision of ethanol may only increase the predisposition to pancreatitis. To test this possibility, we developed an assay system using the in vitro model of cerulein-induced pancreatitis. In this system, pancreatic lobules were first exposed to a supraphysiologic concentration (10(-6) M) of the cholecystokinin analogue, cerulein, after which homogenates were incubated for up to 6 h. Activation of trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen was observed only in cerulein-treated preparations. We then investigated the effects of the duration of ethanol feeding on cerulein-induced changes in rat pancreas. The pancreata from rats fed ethanol for 9-12 months were more susceptible to cerulein-induced activation of chymotrypsinogen compared to the pancreata from pair-fed control animals. This susceptibility also paralleled morphologic changes, such as dilatation of endoplasmic reticulum, only in the ethanol-fed group. In contrast, during the early stages (up to 3 months) of ethanol consumption, there was resistance (p < 0.01) to cerulein-induced changes. These results suggest that long-term ethanol consumption increases susceptibility to pancreatitis and raises the possibility that a similar mechanism may operate in human alcoholics.
