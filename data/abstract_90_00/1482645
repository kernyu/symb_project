A child with congenital nephrotic syndrome underwent renal transplantation, was treated for acute rejection, and then developed nephrotic syndrome and renal failure. He was felt to have minimal change disease on allograft biopsy, but failed to respond to therapy with corticosteroids. Cyclophosphamide was substituted for cyclosporine and rapidly induced a complete remission of his nephrotic syndrome. We feel that this case not only represents an important example of a useful therapeutic approach to the child with congenital nephrotic syndrome who develops nephrotic syndrome post transplantation, and also raises questions concerning the pathogenesis of congenital nephrotic syndrome.
