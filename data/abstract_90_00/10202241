The common gamma chain (gammac) of cytokine receptors is mutated in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency, a lethal disorder characterized by the absence of both humoral and cellular immune defenses. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from HLA-identical siblings usually results in complete reconstitution of the immune system and is the current treatment of choice. Genetic correction and reinfusion of autologous hematopoietic stem cells represents an alternative therapeutic approach for those patients who lack suitable marrow donors. In this study, we show that retroviral-mediated transfer of the gammac gene results in efficient expression in CD34+ cells and high transduction rate of colony-forming progenitors.
