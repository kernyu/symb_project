A large-scale malaria intervention programme using insecticide-treated bed nets and chemoprophylaxis administered to children was introduced into a rural area of The Gambia. The operation was carried out using the existing primary health care (PHC) service in the region. Training of the village health workers, sensitization of the communities, and implementation of net impregnation and the drug delivery programme are described. This delivery system resulted in over 90% of nets being treated with insecticide and 80% of children receiving over 90% of their tablets during the rainy season. There was considerable variation in the distribution of permethrin on a bed net and between individual nets, which is likely to facilitate the spread of insecticide resistance in the local mosquito populations. Bed nets made from heavier fabrics tended to absorb more insecticide than those made from lighter materials. Four months after dipping, 89% of the insecticide had been lost from treated nets. This was probably due mainly to women washing their nets, an activity carried out on average once every 2 months during the rainy season. The high number of insecticide-treated bed nets in the study area demonstrated that a malaria control programme operated through a PHC system can be implemented successfully.
