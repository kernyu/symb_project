Activation of endothelin receptors on the vasculature can produce a variety of responses from potent vasoconstriction to mild vasodilation, depending on the receptor complement within the tissue. To elucidate the potential role of endothelin analogues as tumour blood flow modifiers, we have evaluated the effect of the ET(B) receptor agonist, IRL 1620 ([Suc-(Glu9, Ala(11,15))-ET-1(8-21)]) in CBH/CBi rats bearing an HSN fibrosarcoma. Tissue blood flow and vascular resistance were determined, 20 min following administration of IRL 1620 (bolus intravenous), using the uptake of radiolabelled iodoantipyrine (125I-IAP). Blood flow was unchanged in most tissues. However, at doses > or = 1.0 nmol kg(-1) IRL 1620, blood flow in the brain and heart was increased, whereas in the small intestine it was reduced. Blood flow in the skeletal muscle was reduced at 1.0 nmol kg(-1) only. Tumour blood flow was significantly reduced at 3.0 and 5.0 nmol kg(-1). Vascular resistance was unchanged in most tissues although it was increased in the skeletal muscle at 1.0 nmol kg(-1), in the kidney at 1.0 and 3.0 nmol kg(-1) and in the brain and heart, it was reduced at 5.0 nmol kg(-1) IRL 1620. Vascular resistance was significantly increased in the tumour and the small intestine at doses > or = 1 nmol kg(-1) IRL 1620. Pretreatment of rats with BQ-788, an ET(B) receptor antagonist, selectively attenuated the tumour vascular response to 3 nmol kg(-1) IRL 1620 with no changes observed in the normal tissue responses. Our results demonstrate that the HSN tumour vasculature is selectively responsive to IRL 1620 at doses > 1 nmol kg(-1) compared with the majority of normal tissues with the exception of the small intestine, and that only the tumour response is highly sensitive to BQ-788 antagonism, under the experimental dosing regime investigated. These differences may be exploitable for therapeutic benefit.
