BACKGROUND: A fundamental principle in the therapeutic strategy for recurrent lymphomas is the employment of agents that are not part of the usual front line combination regimens. Ideally, the cytotoxic agents should lack complete cross resistance with those utilized up front. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A three-drug combination of ifosfamide, epirubicin and etoposide (IEV) was used to treat 20 patients with relapsing or refractory high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (HG-NHL) or Hodgkin's disease (HD). RESULTS: Of 14 patients with HG-NHL, 5 (36%) achieved a complete response (CR) and 4 partial remission (PR), giving an overall response rate of 64%. To date, all the complete responders are still in CR at +5, +5, +6, +7, and +9 months, respectively. Of 6 patients with HD, 4 (66%) obtained CR and 2 PR, giving an overall response rate of 100%. The 4 CRs are still in remission after +4, +5, +9, and +13 months, respectively. Clinical and hematologic toxic effects were moderate: neutropenia was responsible for delaying treatment for a week in 6 patients. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the efficacy of the IEV regimen in inducing a good remission rate with moderate side effects in relapsing/refractory HG-NHL and HD patients and they show that further investigations with this combination are warranted.
