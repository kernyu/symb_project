The clinical isolate Staphylococcus aureus WBG1024 was resistant to cadmium, benzyl penicillin, kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, tetracycline and trimethoprim and harboured a conjugative plasmid pWBG637 (34.5 kb) and non-conjugative plasmids of 23.8, 4.4, 2.8 and 1.9 kb. Transduction and mixed-culture transfer experiments demonstrated that the 4.4-kb plasmid (pWBG632) encoded resistance to tetracycline and the 23.8-kb plasmid (pWBG628) encoded resistance to cadmium, benzyl penicillin, kanamycin, neomycin and streptomycin. The conjugative plasmid pWBG637 was able to mobilise a further 4.4-kb plasmid (pWBG633) encoding streptomycin resistance and recombined with the multiresistance plasmid pWBG628 to produce transconjugantes of various resistance phenotypes.
