The rate of reversion from azidothymidine (zidovudine; AZT) resistance was studied by direct sequencing of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) virion RNA in sera from four patients who discontinued long-term treatment. Before cessation of treatment, all four patients harbored HIV-1 with multiple mutations reported to confer AZT resistance. In three patients, slow reversions of these mutations starting after 9, 9, and 18 months were detected. The slow reversions indicate that AZT-resistant HIV-1 variants are likely to have an unaltered replicative capacity and pathogenic potential. Furthermore, there were discrepancies between the in vivo RNA sequences and the sequences of virus isolates, indicating that the isolation procedure may select for nonrepresentative virus variants.
