We did a statistical study of 294 strains of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) isolated from skin infections during the period from January of 1989 to December of 1991 in the Department of Dermatology, Kansai Medical University Hospital. We especially examined methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) from the point of view of incidence, variety of skin infections with MRSA, coagulase type, phase type, and resistance against antimicrobial agents. The frequency of isolation of MRSA has been increasing. In 1991, the proportion of MRSA isolates among all S. aureus strains isolated from skin infections was 41.5%. MRSA was isolated most often from infectious decubitus. Coagulase type II and phage group NT (not typable) MRSA were most frequently isolated. The resistance of MRSA to OFLX and IMP/CS had remarkably increased. Notably, the resistance to MINO was low before 1991.
