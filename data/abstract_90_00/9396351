We analyzed the in vitro antibiotic susceptibility pattern and serovar for 192 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated at Beijing Hospital(China) from October 1991 to October 1993. The frequency of resistant strains was high, more than 15%, for ceftazidime, cefsulodin, cefoperazone, aztreonam, gentamicin, tobramycin, tosufloxacin, ofloxacin and fosfomycin. The incidence of resistants against piperacillin and imipenem was significantly low. Among the 192 strains, 16 were designated as being multi-drug resistant strains(i.e.; resistant to more than 8 drugs out of 11 drugs), and all of the multi-drug resistant strains were isolated from inpatients. Predominant serovar of 192 strains were 60(31.3%) for G, 28(14.7%) for E, and 24(12.5%) for I. Multi-drug resistant strains have no characteristic serovar. Restriction enzyme SpeI digestion analysis(using pulse field electrophoresis) of P. aeruginosa-genome yielded several common patterns, and was shown to be useful for tracing the route of nosocomial infection. Further, isolates with closely related genome type, in which the size of one digested band was different, showed a different minimum inhibitory concentration of fosfomycin in one genome type or new quinolones in the other genome type. Analysis of genome type and antibiotic susceptibility pattern may exhibit the antibiotic resistant gene.
