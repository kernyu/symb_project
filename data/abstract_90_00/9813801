STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The survival of pulpless teeth restored with a post and core system is a controversial issue. PURPOSE: This study compared the fracture resistance of 2 types of restorations: teeth restored with prefabricated carbon-fiber posts and composite cores to cast dowel-core restored teeth. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 44 recently extracted sound premolars were randomly distributed into 2 equal groups: group I, restored with prefabricated carbon-fiber post and a composite core; and group II, with custom-cast type III gold alloy post and cores. The size and shape of the posts were identical in the 2 groups. All teeth were fully covered with a nonprecious cast crown. Fracture resistance was measured by applying a point force at 45 degrees to the long angle of the tooth. RESULTS: Mean fracture threshold was 103.7 +/- 53.1 kg for group I versus 202.7 +/- 125.0 kg for group II (differences significant with P = .003). In group II, however, fracture nearly always affected the tooth itself, whereas in group I, the post-core nearly always failed first. CONCLUSIONS: Significantly higher fracture thresholds were recorded for the cast post and core group. Teeth restored with cast posts typically showed fracture of the tooth, although at loads rarely occurring clinically.
