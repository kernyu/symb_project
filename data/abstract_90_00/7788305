Some novel furogamma lactams have been synthesised by one step condensation of arylaminomalonates with substituted furyl acryloyl chlorides. The annulation of substituted monocyclic gammalactams followed by cyclization produced novel tricyclic furogamma lactams. Some of these furogammalactams are found to exhibit Gram-positive and Gram-negative antibacterial activity at very high concentrations.
