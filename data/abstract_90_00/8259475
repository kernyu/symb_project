In view of the increasing incidence of non-typhoid salmonellosis, the effect of early treatment with ciprofloxacin on the permanent elimination of salmonella was evaluated. In a prospective study, 14 patients with non-typhoid salmonellosis were treated with 2 x 500 mg/d ciprofloxacin for 10 days within 5 days of onset of symptoms. Relapse occurred in 4/14 (29%) patients 2-3 weeks after termination of therapy. Using sero- and ribotyping, relapse was confirmed and reinfection ruled out in 4/4 patients. Furthermore, ribotyping suggested double infection in one patient. Development of resistance to ciprofloxacin was not observed. We conclude that the use of antimicrobial chemotherapy to treat non-institutional salmonellosis in immunocompetent patients cannot generally be recommended but must be considered carefully in each case. Indications for ciprofloxacin therapy in the treatment of non-typhoid salmonellosis are discussed.
