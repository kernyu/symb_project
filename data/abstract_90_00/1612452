Ribosomal (r) resistance to gentamicin in clones containing DNA from the producing organism Micromonospora purpurea is determined by grmA, and not by kgmA as originally reported. The kgmA gene originated in Streptomyces tenebrarius and is identical to kgmB. Both grmA and kgm encode enzymes that methylate single specific sites within 16S rRNA, although the site of action of the grmA product has not yet been determined. In either case, the methylated nucleoside is 7-methyl G. Inducible resistance to lincomycin (Ln) and macrolides in Streptomyces lividans TK21 results from expression of two genes: lrm, encoding an rRNA methyltransferase and mgt, encoding a glycosyl transferase (MGT), that specifically inactivates macrolides. The lrm product monomethylates residue A2058 within 23S rRNA (Escherichia coli numbering scheme) and confers high-level resistance to Ln with much lower levels of resistance to macrolides. Substrates for MGT, which utilises UDP-glucose as cofactor, include macrolides with 12-, 14-, 15- or 16-atom cyclic polyketide lactones (as in methymycin, erythromycin, azithromycin or tylosin, respectively) although spiramycin and carbomycin are not apparently modified. The enzyme is specific for the 2'-OH group of saccharide moieties attached to C5 of the 16-atom lactone ring (corresponding to C5 or C3 in 14- or 12-atom lactones, respectively). The lrm and mgt genes have been cloned and sequenced. The deduced lrm product is a 26-kDa protein, similar to other rRNA methyltransferases, such as the carB, tlrA and ermE products, whereas the mgt product (deduced to be 42 kDa) resembles a glycosyl transferase from barley.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
