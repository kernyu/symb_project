The parC and gyrA genes of 73 ciprofloxacin-resistant and 6 ciprofloxacin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium clinical isolates were partly sequenced. Alterations in ParC and GyrA, possibly in combination with other resistance mechanisms, severely restricted the in vitro activities of the nine quinolones tested. For all isolates, clinafloxacin and sitafloxacin showed the best activities.
