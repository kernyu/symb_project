Limitations of currently used antimicrobial agents for the treatment of skin and skin-structure infections (e.g., increased resistance to penicillin and erythromycin and inconvenient dosing schedules) have led to an adjustment in the kinds of antimicrobial agents prescribed for these diseases. Three recently completed clinical studies have demonstrated some therapeutic advantages of cefprozil, a new broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin, over cefaclor and erythromycin in the treatment of skin and skin-structure infections. Specifically, cefprozil offers clinical efficacy equivalent to those of cefaclor and erythromycin both at lower total doses and on a less frequent dosing schedule (once or twice daily vs. three to four times daily). The advantage of once-daily or twice-daily dosing with cefprozil may contribute to patient convenience and compliance.
