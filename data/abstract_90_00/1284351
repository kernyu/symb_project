To study the modes of actinomycin biosynthesis and the mechanism responsible for resistance to the antibiotic producing S. chrysomallus No. 2, the authors undertook an examination and studies into the cloning system for gene(s) of resistance to actinomycin from a S. chrysomallus No. 2 actinomycin C producer and the cloning of a S. chrysomallus No. DNA fragment to the actinomycin-sensitive Streptomyces Sp. 26-115 H-I on the vector plasmid pIJ702. The cloning gave rise to actinomycin-resistant strains. The character of actinomycin resistance is inheritable in a steady fashion.
