Liver transplantation in patients infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) commonly results in reinfection that, if untreated, often compromises the viability of the allograft and negatively influences survival. Posttransplant treatment with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) is now the standard of care, but patients appear to require lifelong treatment to prevent reinfection. In the past several years, new management strategies in patients with HBV have been developed, with an aim to decrease HBV-DNA replication before transplantation. Such an approach should increase the success of transplantation by decreasing the risk of reinfection and thus preventing recurrent disease posttransplantation. Nucleoside analogues, either alone or in conjunction with HBIG, are currently in use and are being studied in clinical trials as a means of preventing viral recurrence. Ganciclovir, famciclovir, and lamivudine all have demonstrated efficacy, although they vary in terms of effectiveness. Resistance may develop with the use of these agents and leads to reinfection by the mutant virus. Combination therapy may minimize the risk of viral mutation. Research continues to search for more effective ways to prevent and, if necessary, treat viral recurrence in patients undergoing liver transplantation for HBV.
