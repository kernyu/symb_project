The tuberactinomycins are a group of cyclic peptide antibiotics, which are potent inhibitors of prokaryotic protein synthesis. We report the inhibitory effect of viomycin, di-beta-lysyl-capreomycin IIA and tuberactinomycin A on group I intron self-splicing. They compete with the guanosine cofactor for the G-binding site located in the conserved core of the intron. They are 100-fold more active than all other competitive inhibitors described so far (dGTP, arginine or streptomycin), inhibiting splicing at concentrations between 10 and 50 microM. Mutation of the G-binding site leads to partial resistance, and the inhibitory effect of these drugs is dependent on Mg2+ concentration. This suggests that the tuberactinomycins have more than one contact site with the intron RNA: via the G-binding site and via additional contacts with the RNA backbone. Positioning the tuberactinomycins in the three-dimensional model of the td intron core suggests that the charged lysyl side-chain (R1) is in contact with the backbone of the P1 helix. Structure/function analyses with various tuberactinomycin analogues with different activities confirm the involvement of this sidechain in inhibition of group I self-splicing. The demonstration of a new class of splicing inhibitors, the peptide antibiotics, illustrates how antibiotics may interact with catalytic RNA.
