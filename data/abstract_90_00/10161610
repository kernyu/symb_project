Numerous factors are considered in the design of an antibiotic formulary, consisting primarily of indicators of clinical efficacy and safety, as well as economic viability. Similarly, there are many potential strategies for subsequent antibiotic formulary management ranging from global educational efforts to comprehensive required antibiotic justification programs. Antibiotic formulary management programs should be tailored to individual institutions and utilize a multidisciplinary approach where possible. The primary outcome goals of such programs are generally controlled antibiotic costs, optimized clinical efficacy, minimization of adverse events, and reduced microbial resistance development, although quantification of program impact on these parameters continues to be a challenge.
