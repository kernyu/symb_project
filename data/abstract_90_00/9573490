Clinafloxacin, levofloxacin, sparfloxacin and trovafloxacin were tested by Etest against 188 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. Clinafloxacin and trovafloxacin were 2-4-fold more potent than sparfloxacin and 8-fold more than levofloxacin. Two isolates, both serotype 6, with high-level quinolone resistance (> or = 8 micrograms/ml) were detected. The Etest is a practical means for determining S. pneumoniae susceptibilities to new fluoroquinolones.
