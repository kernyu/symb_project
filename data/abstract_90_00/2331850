Sulbactam inhibits the hydrolytic activity of several, clinically important beta-lactamases including those produced by anaerobic bacteria. This study was undertaken to determine the effect of sulbactam on the activity of cefoperazone against 250 anaerobic bacteria including 174 isolates belonging to the Bacteroides fragilis group and to compare the activity of cefoperazone/sulbactam with other antimicrobial agents. beta-lactamase activity was detected in 98% of the isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group but not in the other species evaluated. Antagonistic activity between cefoperazone and sulbactam was not observed with any of the species. Forty-two percent of the isolates belonging to the B. fragilis group were resistant to cefoperazone. Ninety-four percent of these were converted to either the susceptible or moderately susceptible range upon the addition of sulbactam. Sixty-seven percent were susceptible to the combination cefoperazone/sulbactam and 27% were moderately susceptible. Overall, metronidazole and chloramphenicol were the most active antimicrobials. Significant differences in the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of members of the B. fragilis group were observed. Sulbactam demonstrated some intrinsic activity against all of the species tested.
