The hygromycin B (Hy) phosphotransferase-encoding gene (hph), was tested as a selectable marker in the protozoan, Trypanosoma brucei. The hph gene was placed under the control of the promoter of a procyclic acidic repetitive protein-encoding gene, and was integrated by homologous recombination into an intergenic region of the alpha beta-tubulin-encoding gene tandem array of T. brucei. In contrast to many other selectable markers tested, spontaneous Hy resistance was not observed, making Hy a second useful marker for transformation of this protozoan.
