Several cosmid clones from Streptomyces ambofaciens containing the spiramycin resistance gene srmB were introduced into S. fradiae PM73, a mutant defective in tylosin synthesis, resulting in tylosin synthesis. The DNA responsible for this complementation was localized to a 10.5-kilobase EcoRI fragment. A 32-kilobase DNA segment which included the srmB spiramycin resistance gene and DNA which complemented the defect in strain PM73 were mutagenized in vivo with Tn10 carrying the gene for Nmr (which is expressed in Streptomyces spp.) or in vitro by insertional mutagenesis with a drug resistance gene (Nmr) cassette. When these mutagenized DNA segments were crossed into the S. ambofaciens chromosome, three mutant classes blocked in spiramycin synthesis were obtained. One mutant accumulated two precursors of spiramycin, platenolide I and platenolide II. Two mutants, when cofermented with the platenolide-accumulating mutant, produced spiramycin. Tylactone supplementation of these two mutants resulted in the synthesis of a group of compounds exhibiting antibiotic activity. Two other mutants failed to coferment with any of the other mutants or to respond to tylactone supplementation.
