OBJECTIVES: To determine and compare the efficacy and tolerability of two 1-week regimen comprising omeprazole, clarithromycin and amoxycillin or metronidazole in the eradication of Helicobacter pylori, and to determine the influence of bacterial resistance to metronidazole and clarithromycin on the outcome of treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with unequivocal evidence of H. pylori infection based on culture, histology and rapid urease test of both antrum and corpus biopsies were recruited for the study. The study was a randomized, investigator-blind, comparative study. Patients received either omeprazole 20 mg o.m., clarithromycin 250 mg b.d. and amoxycillin 500 mg b.d. (OAC) or omeprazole 20 mg o.m., metronidazole 400 mg b.d. and clarithromycin 250 mg b.d. (OMC) for 1 week. Patients were assessed for successful eradication, which was defined as absence of bacteria in all tests (culture, histology and urease test on both antral and corpus biopsies), at least 4 weeks after completion of therapy. RESULTS: Eighty-two patients were recruited for the study. Eradication rates on intention-to-treat analysis were--OAC: 36/41 (87.8%, 95% CI: 73.8, 95.9); OMC: 33/41 (80.5%, 95% CI: 65.1, 91.2). On per protocol analysis were--OAC: 36/40 (90%, 95% CI: 76.3, 97.2); OMC: 32/38 (84.2%, 95% CI: 68.7, 94.0). All side-effects encountered were mild and no patient discontinued treatment because of intolerance to medications. The most common side-effects were altered taste (OAC 31.7%, OMC 53.7%) and lethargy (OAC 14.6%, OMC 19.5%). Pre-treatment metronidazole resistance was encountered in 34/63 (54.0%) patients. No bacterial strains were found with primary resistance to clarithromycin. Metronidazole resistance did not significantly affect eradication rates. Emergence of resistance to clarithromycin was not seen post-therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Both the OAC and the OMC regimens were convenient and well-tolerated treatments for H. pylori. However, eradication rates were lower than anticipated.
