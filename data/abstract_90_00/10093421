A short term investigation on the Campylobacter enteritis among children under 10 years of age was carried out in Chennai. The study revealed an isolation rate of 11 per cent in 100 patients suffering from acute diarrhoea comprising C. jejuni (8%) and C. coli. (3%). Among the two culture methods used, the candle jar method was found to be superior to plastic bag incubation system in recovering campylobacters on charcoal cefeperazone deoxycholate agar. While all the isolates were sensitive to ciprofloxacin, all of them exhibited resistance to nalidixic acid.
