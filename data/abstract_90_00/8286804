OBJECTIVE: To present a case of Rhodococcus equi (RE) pneumonia and discuss its pathophysiology and treatment. CASE SUMMARY: An HIV-positive patient presented with pneumonia. A lung biopsy was performed after sputum and thoracentesis cultures failed to identify a pathogen. The lung biopsy revealed an unidentifiable, diphtheroid-like, gram-positive rod. A bronchoscopy performed five days after the lung biopsy produced the same diphtheroid-like, gram-positive rod. The patient was treated with several injectable antibiotics, but emergence of resistance to two of the antibiotics was suspected. Two weeks after the bacterial isolate was sent to a reference laboratory, it was identified as RE. The patient was discharged on oral antibiotics and experienced no recurrence of RE pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: RE can be difficult to identify in the microbiology laboratory, or it may be assumed to be a colonizing diphtheroid. The isolation of difficult-to-identify, gram-positive rods, or diphtheroids, from a pulmonary source in a patient with decreased cell-mediated immunity should cause one to suspect RE. RE has been noted to develop resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics during therapy. A prolonged course of combination antibiotic therapy directed at the intracellular component of infection is necessary.
