Porcine colonic spirochetosis is a nonfatal diarrheal disease that affects pigs during the growing and finishing stages of production. The disease is caused by Serpulina pilosicoli, a newly recognized species of pathogenic intestinal spirochete. Antimicrobial therapy aimed at reducing the infection may be helpful in controlling spirochetal diarrhea. In this study, the in vitro antimicrobial susceptibilities of the reference isolate S. pilosicoli P43/6/78 from the United Kingdom and 19 field isolates obtained from pigs in Canada (n = 5) and the United States (n = 14) were determined against the antimicrobial agents carbadox, gentamicin, lincomycin, and tiamulin, all of which are commonly used for control of the related pathogenic intestinal spirochete S. hyodysenteriae. Additionally, the susceptibility or resistance of each isolate against each antimicrobial agent was estimated on the basis of available data on the in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility breakpoints of S. hyodysenteriae. Each isolate was identified on the basis of phenotypic and genotypic markers, and the minimum inhibitory concentration of each antimicrobial agent was determined by the agar-dilution method. All the isolates were susceptible to carbadox and tiamulin. The percentages of isolates susceptible, intermediate, and resistant to lincomycin were 42.1%, 42.1%, and 15.8%, respectively. Slightly less than half of the isolates (47.4%) were susceptible to gentamicin, and the remainder (52.6%) were resistant. Implementation of rational control measures to reduce infection by S. pilosicoli should improve overall health and productivity in swine herds.
