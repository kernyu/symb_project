In search of adhesion-variant strains of Candida albicans the adherence of a number of polyenes and/or azole-resistant strains of this yeast was studied (C. albicans 6406, 6406/8 and 799-XL, -XS, -YS, -R and YL). For comparison C. albicans KCCC 14172, known for its high adhesion and proteinase production, was also used. All isolates showed significantly lower adhesion (P < 0.001) compared with KCCC 14172. The exception was 6406/8 which showed superior adherability to all strains tested (2.5-4.8 times more adherent). This superiority prompted us to study the possible variation between this strain and the others in parameters that contribute to pathogenicity. Strain 6406/8 had the smallest average cell size (0.5-0.75 the size of cells from other strains). Variation in proteinase production and germ-tube formation existed among strains, with strain 6406/8 producing the lowest levels of inducible proteinase (2-4-fold less than the others), as well as being the least germ-tube former (10 times less than other strains). Ultrastructural comparisons between strain 6406/8 and its parent showed that the mutant strain had a thinner cell wall with a dense floccular layer throughout the cell wall compared to the parent strain. The cytoplasmic membrane of the mutant was more conspicuous than that of the parent strain. Comparison of the pathogenicity of strain 6406/8 and its parent (6406) revealed that although the mutant strain initially showed higher colonization than the parent strain, it was cleared much faster.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
