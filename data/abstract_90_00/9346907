Wortmannin is a natural product that inhibits signal transduction. One target of wortmannin in mammalian cells is the 110-kDa catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). We show that wortmannin is toxic to the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and present genetic and biochemical evidence that a phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI 4-kinase), STT4, is a target of wortmannin in yeast. In a strain background in which stt4 mutants are rescued by osmotic support with sorbitol, the toxic effects of wortmannin are similarly prevented by sorbitol. In contrast, in a different strain background, STT4 is essential under all conditions and wortmannin toxicity is not mitigated by sorbitol. Overexpression of STT4 confers wortmannin resistance, but overexpression of PIK1, a related PI 4-kinase, does not. In vitro, the PI 4-kinase activity of STT4, but not of PIK1, was potently inhibited by wortmannin. Overexpression of the phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase homolog MSS4 conferred wortmannin resistance, as did deletion of phospholipase C-1. These observations support a model for a phosphatidylinositol metabolic cascade involving STT4, MSS4, and phospholipase C-1 and provide evidence that an essential product of this pathway is the lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate.
