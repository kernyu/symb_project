OBJECTIVES: Bacteriological data indicate that there is an increased incidence of Streptococcus pneumoniae strains with an intermediate sensitivity to penicillin. The goals of the present study was i) to investigate the profile of sensitivity of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from patients with bacterial pneumonia in the area of Montpellier and ii) to compare this profile with the findings of the national center registry to better appreciate geographical specificity. METHODS: Fifty-six patients with bacterial pneumonia were enrolled into the study. From September 1989 to March 1994, we performed bacterial sampling including blood cultures, protected brushes and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens. We examined the antibiotic sensitivity of the germs which were isolated. All patients were followed using clinical and radiological criteria. RESULTS: A precise bacteriological diagnosis was established in 83.6% of the population. Streptococcus pneumoniae was found in 47.2% of the samples. In 19%, the strains displayed an intermediate sensitivity to penicillin. All patients recovered. CONCLUSION: We found a higher rate of resistance to penicillin in Montpellier than the common rate of the national reference center in France. The location of Montpellier closed to the Spanish border might, at least in part, explain this difference.
