About 5% of patients admitted to acute-care hospitals acquire nosocomial infections. A variety of factors contribute: increasing age of patients; availability, for treatment of formerly untreatable diseases, of extensive surgical and intensive medical therapies; and frequent use of antimicrobial drugs capable of selecting a resistant microbial flora. Nosocomial infections due to resistant organisms have been a problem ever since infections due to penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus aureus were noted within a few years of the introduction of penicillin. By the 1960s aerobic Gram-negative bacilli had assumed increasing importance as nosocomial pathogens, and many strains were resistant to available antimicrobials. During the 1980s the principal organisms causing nosocomial bloodstream infections were coagulase-negative staphylococci, aerobic Gram-negative bacilli, S. aureus, Candida spp., and Enterococcus spp. Coagulase-negative staphylococci and S. aureus are often methicillin-resistant, requiring parenteral use of vancomycin. Prevalence of vancomycin resistance among enterococcal isolates from patients in intensive care units has increased, likely due to increased use of this drug. Plasmid-mediated gentamicin resistance in up to 50% of enterococcal isolates, along with enhanced penicillin resistance in some strains, leaves few therapeutic options. The emergence of Enterobacteriaceae with chromosomal or plasmid-encoded extended spectrum beta-lactamases presents a world-wide problem of resistance to third generation cephalosporins. Control of these infections rests on (i) monitoring infections with such resistant organisms in an ongoing fashion, (ii) prompt institution of barrier precautions when infected or colonized patients are identified, and (iii) appropriate use of antimicrobials through implementation of antibiotic control programs.
