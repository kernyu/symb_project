Enterococcus faecalis 226, isolated from natural whey cultures utilized as starters in the manufacture of mozzarella cheese from water-buffalo milk, produces a bacteriocin designated enterocin 226NWC. The bacteriocin was isolated from culture supernatant fluids of the producer strain and was active against strains of the same species and Listeria monocytogenes, but not against useful lactic acid bacteria. Enterocin 226NWC is a protein with an apparent molecular weight of about 5800; it is relatively heat-stable and has a bactericidal mode of action. Listeria monocytogenes, growing in the presence of the enterocin 226NWC producer strain in broth and in reconstituted skim milk, was inhibited.
