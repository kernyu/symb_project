Susceptibilities of Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia spp. isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 hospitals during June 1994 to May 1995 to various antimicrobial agents were compared with those in the same period of previous years according to a classification, uncomplicated UTIs, complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter, and complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter. No remarkable changes were found in susceptibilities of Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp. and Serratia spp. The susceptibilities of E. faecalis to amikacin and quinolones were better than those in 1993. As for S. aureus, susceptible strains to all drugs increased in uncomplicated UTIs. Against E. coli in 1993, the antimicrobial activities of piperacillin, cefotiam and aminoglycosides have decreased, however, in 1994, these activities have turned to the better state. As for Klebsiella spp. susceptible strains to ABPC decreased. The susceptibilities of P. mirabilis to all drugs except minocycline were good. Against P. aeruginosa in 1993, the activities of aminoglycosides have decreased, but, in 1994, these activities have turned to the better state. These data should be considered in clinical treatment of various urinary tract infections.
