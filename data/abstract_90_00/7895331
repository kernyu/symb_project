In perinatal lungs, veins contribute substantially to total pulmonary vascular resistance. The present study was designed to determine the role of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (EDNO) in modulating the responsiveness of pulmonary veins and arteries in newborn lambs. Fourth-order pulmonary arterial and venous rings of newborn lambs were suspended in organ chambers filled with modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution (95% O2/5% CO2, 37 degrees C), and their isometric force was measured. Nitro-L-arginine had no effect on the resting tension of pulmonary arteries but caused an endothelium-dependent contraction of pulmonary veins. During contraction to endothelin-1 or U46619, acetylcholine, bradykinin, and calcium ionophore A23187 induced larger endothelium-dependent relaxation in pulmonary veins than in arteries. The endothelium-dependent relaxation of pulmonary vessels was abolished by nitro-L-arginine. In vessels without endothelium, nitric oxide induced significantly greater relaxation in pulmonary veins than in arteries. All vessels relaxed similarly to 8-bromo-cGMP. Radioimmunoassay showed that the basal level of intracellular cGMP of pulmonary veins with endothelium was higher than that of arteries with endothelium. Acetylcholine, bradykinin, and calcium ionophore A23187 induced a significantly larger endothelium-dependent increase in the intracellular content of cGMP in pulmonary veins than in arteries. In vessels without endothelium, nitric oxide induced a larger increase in cGMP content in pulmonary veins than in arteries. The present study suggests that EDNO may play a larger role in modulation of pulmonary venous than arterial reactivity, which may be mainly due to a difference in the activity of soluble guanylate cyclase in vascular smooth muscle.
