Bacteria were isolated from soil samples, containing high exchangeable lead concentrations, obtained from a busy freeway in the Mexico City metropolitan area. Forty-five selected strains (86.7% Gram-positive) had a single MIC distribution pattern for lead (800-1600 micrograms/ml lead nitrate) and were considered lead-resistant. The isolates showed variable levels of resistance to arsenate (86.7%), chromate (66.7%), cadmium (57.6%), and mercury (31.1%) ions. Multiple inorganic-ion resistance was shown by all strains.
