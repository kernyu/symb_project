The MICs of ofloxacin for 743 strains of Escherichia coli isolated from 1988 to 1994 were determined by testing. The strains were from patients with urinary tract infections complicated by functional or anatomical disorders of the urinary tract. Those determined to be ofloxacin resistant (MIC, > or =12.5 microg/ml) comprised 3 of 395 strains (1.3%) from the 1988 to 1990 group, 2 of 166 strains (1.2%) from the 1991 to 1992 group, and 7 of 182 strains (3.8%) from the 1993 to 1994 group. The incidence of resistant strains increased significantly during this period. The percentage of isolates with moderately decreased susceptibilities to ofloxacin (MIC, 0.39 to 3.13 microg/ml) also rose during the same period. To determine the incidence of gyrA mutations in urinary-tract-derived strains of E. coli, we developed a simple and rapid assay based on PCR amplification of the region of the gyrA gene containing the mutation sites followed by digestion of the PCR product with a restriction enzyme. Using this assay, we examined all 182 strains isolated in 1993 and 1994 for the presence of mutations at Ser-83 and Asp-87 in the gyrA gene. Of these strains, 33 (18.1%) had mutations in the gyrA gene. The incidences of mutations at Ser-83, at Asp-87, and at both codons were 10.4 (19 strains), 4.4 (8 strains), and 3.3% (6 strains), respectively. To determine the correlation of the mutations in the gyrA gene with susceptibilities to quinolones (nalidixic acid, ofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin), we further examined 116 strains for which the MICs of ofloxacin were > or =0.2 microg/ml that were chosen from the isolates in the 1988 to 1992 group. The MICs of nalidixic acid for the strains without mutations at either Ser-83 or Asp-87 were < or =25 microg/ml, whereas those for the strains with single mutations or double mutations were from 50 to >800 microg/ml. For the fluoroquinolones, significant differences in the distributions of the MICs were observed among the strains without mutations, with single mutations, and with double mutations. The accumulation of mutations in the gyrA gene was associated with an increase in fluoroquinolone resistance. Ofloxacin MICs for the majority of the strains with single and double mutations were 0.39 to 3.13 and 6.25 to 100 microg/ml, respectively. This study demonstrates a chronological increase in the percentage of not only highly fluoroquinolone-resistant strains, corresponding to those with double mutations in the gyrA gene, but also strains with moderately decreased susceptibilities to fluoroquinolones, corresponding to those with single mutations. This increase in the incidence of strains with a single mutation in the gyrA gene portends a further increase in the incidence of strains with clinically significant resistance to fluoroquinolones.
