Mouse brain infected with the ME7 strain of scrapie agent was exposed for 24 h to a range of concentrations of PAA, either as fragments of intact brain or as supernates of homogenised brain. Two % PAA inactivated the infectivity in intact tissue but not in a supernate. None of the concentrations tested (up to 19%) was effective with supernates, and this was considered to result from the protection afforded by aggregation of infectivity-containing particles.
