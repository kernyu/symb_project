The membrane transport of ara-C and intracellular ara-CTP accumulation were investigated in P388 murine leukemic cells resistant to vincristine (P388/VCR) and its parent cell line. The transport of ara-C in P388/VCR cell line was a 1.4-fold increase at 30 sec compared to that in P388 parent cell line (P less than 0.01). The increase of the transport of ara-C in P388/VCR cell line, however, was not completely abolished by the nucleoside transport inhibitor, nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBTI) to the level in parent cell line. Scatchard analyses revealed that the resistant cells had significantly less NBTI binding sites than the parent cells had. These results suggested that the changes in ara-C transport in P388/VCR cells were due, in part, to increase of NBTI-insensitive transport sites in the membrane. The measurement of the intracellular ara-CTP concentration by high-performance liquid chromatography revealed that the intracellular ara-CTP level in P388/VCR cells was also significantly higher than that in parent cells (1.4-fold, P less than 0.01). As the transport of ara-C is rate limiting at a concentration of 1 microM in the both cell lines, we concluded that the accumulation of ara-CTP in P388/VCR cells might have partially resulted from the enhancement of the ara-C transport.
