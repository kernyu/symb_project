Peptic ulcer disease associated with H pylori infection is curable. The important factors in selecting therapy are efficacy of eradication, prevention of resistance, avoidance or minimization of adverse effects, patient compliance, and cost. The most effective regimens include a bismuth preparation or antisecretory drug (proton pump inhibitor or H2 receptor antagonist) plus two antibiotics administered for 14 days. Dual-drug therapies are not recommended. Triple-drug regimens are more likely to eradicate H pylori and less likely to generate resistant strains among surviving organisms. In general, cure of the infection should be confirmed 4 weeks after completion of the treatment. Antibiotic resistance is an important consideration in choosing therapy, and patients should be taught the importance of compliance. When treatment fails, antibiotic combinations should not be repeated. Considerations for anti-H pylori treatment in a managed care environment mirror those for good medical practice in general, with special attention to stringent cost-control or outcomes-driven measures.
