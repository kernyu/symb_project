OBJECTIVES: Assess the evolution of viral load in HIV-infected patients whose viral load was < 500 copies/ml during the first three months of 1997. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The viral load during the first three months of 1998 was recorded for comparison. Data were collected from the DM12 database implanted in the CISIH and concerned 2113 patients. RESULTS: Virological failure was observed in one-third of the patients in the study cohort whose viral load was undetectable in 1997 (< 500 copies/ml) as their load was > 500 copies/ml one year later in 1998. The percentage of patients in a situation of virological failure in 1998 who were taking tritherapy in 1997 (38%) was lower than that in those who were not (47%). The clinical and immunological characteristics were however similar. The difference in the therapeutic regimen would probably explain the difference. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that virological failure is an important problem. Other analyses should be conducted in other cohorts to determine the influence of non compliance or resistance to antiretroviral treatments. Future therapeutic strategies should take into account the results of such studies.
