We explored the role of the NF-kappa B pathway in the survival of primary human CD4+ T lymphocytes during CD28 costimulation. Transduction of proliferating CD4+ T cells with a tetracycline-regulated retrovirus encoding for a dominant-interfering, degradation-resistant I-kappaBalpha (inhibitor of kappa B alpha factor) mutant induced apoptosis. Using DNA arrays, we show that Bcl-xL features as a prominent anti-apoptotic member among a number of early CD28-inducible genes. A 1.2-kb segment of the proximal Bcl-xL promoter, linked to a luciferase reporter, responded to CD3/CD28 stimulation in Jurkat cells. Mutation of an NF-kappa B site around -840 decreased, while ectopic expression of I-kappa B kinase-beta (IKK beta) enhanced reporter gene activity. Na+-salicylate and cyclopentenone PGs, direct inhibitors of IKK beta, interfered in the activation of the Bcl-xL promoter and induced apoptosis in CD28-costimulated CD4+ T cells. Moreover, salicylate blocked nuclear localization of NF-kappa B factors that bind to the NF-kappa B binding site in the Bcl-xL promoter, as well as the expression of Bcl-xL protein. HuT-78, a lymphoblastoid T cell line with constitutive NF-kappa B activity, contained elevated levels of Bcl-xL protein and, similar to proliferating CD4+ T cells, was resistant to apoptotic stimuli such as anti-Fas and TNF-alpha. In contrast, the same stimuli readily induced apoptosis in a Jurkat T cell clone with no detectable Bcl-xL expression. Jurkat BMS2 cells also differed from HuT-78 in collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential and superoxide generation in the mitochondrium. Taken together, these data demonstrate that CD3/CD28-induced activation of IKK beta and expression of Bcl-xL promote the survival of primary human CD4+ T lymphocytes.
