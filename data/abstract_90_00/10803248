In mixed cultures of staphylococci a transfer of the resistance to methicillin and penicillinase plasmids as well as tetracycline and chloramphenicol plasmids was investigated. It was shown that the resistance to methicillin was transferred in mixed cultures from one strain of S. aureus to another and from S. epidermidis to S. aureus. In both cases transfer of methicillin resistance required, the presence of penicillinase plasmid in recipient or donor strain. In the case of other markers transmission was independent. Moreover it was shown that the transfer of resistance genes in mixed cultures was mediated by bacteriophage of the serologic group A.
