BACKGROUND: In-vitro and clinical efficacy of a combination therapy consisting of 3 antibiotic agents was to be assessed in neonatal septicemia. METHODS: From 1980 to 1987, 152 newborns with septicemia as proven by blood culture were treated with an initial antibiotic regimen consisting of azlocillin (150 mg/kg bw), cefotaxime (100 mg/kg bw), and tobramycin (5 mg/kg bw). RESULTS: According to the microbiologic testing, antimicrobic therapy was effective in each of the 152 organisms: 101/152 bacteria were susceptible to all 3 agents; resistance to 1 or 2 of the antibiotics was evident in 33/152 and in 18/152 organisms, respectively. Mortality due to septicemia was 7.2%. CONCLUSION: As no difference was observed in the frequency in which one of the three antibiotic substances was the only effective drug, each of the 3 agents seemed to be necessary for clinical effectiveness of this antibiotic combination.
