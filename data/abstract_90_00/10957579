The transferability and expression of beta-lactam resistance were compared in multiresistant clinical isolates of Enterobacter spp. collected from different hospitals in Bratislava, Slovakia (n = 15) and Innsbruck, Austria (n = 19) during 1996-1997. The strains from Bratislava were resistant to ampicillin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone. All strains from Innsbruck were resistant to ampicillin and cefoxitin; 17 were also resistant to ceftazidime and aztreonam but the majority remained susceptible to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. All strains were susceptible to cefepime and imipenem. The majority of the tested strains transferred resistance determinants to E. coli recipient by conjugation. Production of beta-lactamase including ESBL was the major mechanism of beta-lactam resistance. Large plasmids of 77-88 and 91 kb were confirmed in clinical isolates from Bratislava and Innsbruck.
