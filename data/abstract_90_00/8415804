We hypothesized that 5-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase products might be mediators of cardiopulmonary and systemic vascular effects induced by a 4 h continuous infusion of platelet-activating factor (PAF, 10 ng/kg/min) in anesthetized pigs. Indomethacin (cyclooxygenase inhibitor) potentiated and CGS 8515 (5-lipoxygenase inhibitor) attenuated PAF-induced increases in total peripheral resistance (TPR) from 2.5 to 4 h. However, the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor failed to modify pulmonary vasoconstriction and hypertension caused by PAF. Except for a delay in onset (approximately 44 s) and rate of development of pulmonary hypertension during the initial 10 min of PAF infusion, the pulmonary hemodynamic changes were also not attenuated by indomethacin. On the other hand, at 4 h, the PAF-induced pulmonary hypertension and systemic vasoconstriction were completely or partially reversed, respectively, by WEB 2086 (PAF receptor antagonist). The PAF-induced increases in plasma thromboxane B2 (TXB2) were blocked by indomethacin but not by CGS 8515, and at 4 h the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor potentiated the levels of TXB2 in pigs treated with PAF. The plasma concentrations of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) were not modified by PAF or CGS 8515 + PAF. We conclude that PAF-induced increases in TPR (2.5-4 h) are potentiated by indomethacin and are dependent on 5-lipoxygenase products other than LTB4. Although the early pulmonary vascular response (< 10 min) to PAF is dependent on cyclooxygenase products, the sustained response (after 10 min) cannot be explained by either 5-lipoxygenase or cyclooxygenase products but may be mediated directly by PAF receptors.
