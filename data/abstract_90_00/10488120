With increasing size, multicellular prostate tumor spheroids develop regions of quiescent, multidrug-resistant cells expressing the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(kip1). Treatment of small (diameter 60 +/- 20 micrometer) spheroids with 200 microM hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) resulted in cell cycle arrest owing to up-regulation of p27(kip1) and down-regulation of the transcription factor c-Fos. Incubation with 100 nM-1 microM H(2)O(2) led to up-regulation of c-Fos and enhanced tumor growth. Growth stimulation was inhibited by bisindolylmaleimide I, indicating a role for protein kinase C in the signaling cascade that involved the mitogen-activated protein kinase members MEK1,2, ERK1, -2, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Changes in Ca(2+) influx underlined the differential effects of H(2)O(2). Incubation with 200 microM H(2)O(2) released [Ca(2+)](i) from intracellular stores followed by prolonged Ca(2+) influx. Inhibition of influx by Ca(2+)-free media or Ni(2+), La(3+), Mn(2+) and SKF-96365 prevented the induction of quiescence and stimulated spheroid growth. Consequently, treatment with 200 microM H(2)O(2) in Ca(2+)-free media down-regulated p27(kip1) and increased Fos protein. ATP exerted effects comparably to those observed with H(2)O(2). Encoding growth stimulation by [Ca(2+)](i) release and induction of cell quiescence by prolonged Ca(2+) influx may provide a general mechanism for the control of tumor growth.
