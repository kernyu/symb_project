53-year-old man with chronic lymphocytic leukemia resistant to alkylating agent containing regimens, was treated with fludarabine phosphate. Hematological data before the administration of fludarabine phosphate was as follows: RBC 216 x 10(4)/microliter, Hb 7.7 g/dl, WBC 69,400/microliter (lymphocyte 96%), PLT 0.2 x 10(4)/microliter. Bone marrow was fully occupied with lymphocytes. Red blood cells and platelets transfusions were frequently required. Fludarabine phosphate was administered at a dose of 40 mg (23 mg/m2) intravenously for 5 days every 4 weeks. After the start of the therapy, peripheral lymphocyte counts were markedly decreased and recovery of normal hematopoiesis was observed in bone marrow. Any transfusions were no longer necessary. Fludarabine phosphate may be active even for advanced, refractory and terminal stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
