Conjugative transposons are integrated DNA elements that excise themselves to form a covalently closed circular intermediate. This circular intermediate can either reintegrate in the same cell (intracellular transposition) or transfer by conjugation to a recipient and integrate into the recipient's genome (intercellular transposition). Conjugative transposons were first found in gram-positive cocci but are now known to be present in a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria also. Conjugative transposons have a surprisingly broad host range, and they probably contribute as much as plasmids to the spread of antibiotic resistance genes in some genera of disease-causing bacteria. Resistance genes need not be carried on the conjugative transposon to be transferred. Many conjugative transposons can mobilize coresident plasmids, and the Bacteroides conjugative transposons can even excise and mobilize unlinked integrated elements. The Bacteroides conjugative transposons are also unusual in that their transfer activities are regulated by tetracycline via a complex regulatory network.
