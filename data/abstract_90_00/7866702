Small cationic peptides with antimicrobial properties are part of the innate immune response of a wide variety of animal species, including insects, amphibians and mammals. Bacterial pathogens have evolved distinct mechanisms to avoid, inactivate or resist the killing effects of these peptides. Determinants necessary for resistance to peptides often contribute to the virulence properties of recognized pathogens.
