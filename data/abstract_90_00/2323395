The effects of Ca2+ antagonists, verapamil, nicardipine, and diltiazem, on susceptibility to chloroquine were examined in mice infected with chloroquine-sensitive and chloroquine-resistant lines of Plasmodium chabaudi. In mice that received no chloroquine, daily injections of 50 mg/kg of verapamil, nicardipine, or diltiazem did not affect the growth of both sensitive and resistant parasites. When mice were injected daily with verapamil plus 2 to 3 mg/kg chloroquine, the chloroquine-sensitive parasite became more susceptible to chloroquine than the parasite in mice given chloroquine alone. On the other hand, in mice infected with chloroquine-resistant parasites, verapamil severely suppressed the growth of the parasite when accompanied by daily injections of 2 to 3 mg/kg of chloroquine, at which doses resistant parasites grew steadily in the absence of verapamil, indicating reversal of chloroquine resistance. This reversal was dose-dependent between 5 and 50 mg/kg of verapamil. Daily injections of nicardipine or diltiazem at 50 mg/kg also reversed resistance to chloroquine in resistant parasites. These results indicate that Ca2+ antagonists increase the susceptibility to chloroquine in a sensitive line of P. chabaudi and reverse chloroquine resistance in a resistant line.
