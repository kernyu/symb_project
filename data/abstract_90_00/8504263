An in vivo study of P. falciparum sensitivity to chloroquine was conducted at Anjouan island (Republique federale islamique des Comores) from December 1990 to March 1991. The 27 patients included in the study were given chloroquine at a dose regimen of 25 mg/kg over 3 days and were followed up 7 days. Six patients (22.2%) still harboured parasites up to day 7, thus showing a RII/RIII level of resistance. This is likely related to an increased chloroquine consumption by the inhabitants of this island since 1987.
