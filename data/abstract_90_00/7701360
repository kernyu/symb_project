One hundred and thirty-seven children with Campylobacter diarrhoea were reviewed. The predominant species was C. jejuni. Ninety-five percent of the children were below 5 years of age with 61% of these being 2-12 months old. A slight male preponderance was noted. About half the cases presented with fever and bloody diarrhoea; vomiting was seen in 28% and abdominal colic in only 8%. Moderate to severe diarrhoea was present in 48% of the children. Thirty-seven percent had a history of recent or concurrent illness. Other bacterial enteropathogens together with Campylobacter were isolated in 15% of the children. Erythromycin, the most useful drug, when indicated for Campylobacter infections, had an MIC90 of 2 mg/l with 96.2% of the strains being sensitive.
