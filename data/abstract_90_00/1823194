A study was carried on a group of 145 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis in the area of Physiology Office of Bistrita [correction of Bistritza] County Polyclinic. These patients were included, between 1977 and 1986 in the I-B group considered to be "exposed to the risk of chronic evolution". Males were predominant in a ratio of 7/1, and patients from rural areas made up two-thirds of the lot. Twenty-five percent of the patients were aged between 41 and 50 years when they were included in the I-B group. In 62.7% of the cases the duration of the disease varied between 1 and 2 years at the start of the study. In 36.6% of the cases there was resistance to chemotherapy. In 55.2% of the cases a series of other affections were associated that had a negative impact on the first course of therapy, as well as on the following courses. The first associated affection was chronic ethyl intoxication. Therapy was applied according to schemes defined by the Ministry of Health. In none of the cases were the short-term (3 + 3) therapy courses applied. The first course of therapy was followed regularly by only 23.4% of the patients. An analysis of data at the end of the second course of therapy shows that 55.9% of the patients were recuperated, 23.4% had a chronic evolution (and were included in group I-C), and 20.7% died. It is concluded that over half of the patients in this critical stage of the disease could be recuperated when the therapy was followed correctly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
