The study reports on chloroquine resistance of Plasmodium falciparum among Sudanese children (6 month to 16 years) living at Wad Medani, Central Sudan. All RI-III levels of resistant response were confirmed, while in vitro sensitivity test indicated that 25 per cent of P. falciparum isolates examined had exhibited maturation of schizonts at CQ level greater than or equal to 1.6 pmol/microliters blood. CQ was sufficiently retained for 7 days after drug administration whereas an average peak level of CQ in blood (348 ng/ml) was recorded on day 1. Patients were successfully treated by an age-measured dose of parenteral quinine (10 mg/kg).
