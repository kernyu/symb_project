A transferable 55-MDa plasmid which encoded resistance to both vancomycin and high concentrations of gentamicin was identified in a clinical isolate of Enterococcus faecalis. The plasmid hybridized with probes for the vanB and aac6'aph2" resistance genes. This is the first report of linkage of glycopeptide and high-level aminoglycoside resistance genes in an Enterococcus sp.
