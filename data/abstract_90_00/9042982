BACKGROUND: Peptic ulcer patients need to be treated with antimicrobials to cure Helicobacter pylori infection. Seven-day quadruple therapy is the regimen with the highest cure rates. An ultra-short quadruple therapy was evaluated prospectively. METHODS: Forty-six consecutive H. pylori positive patients (33 had proven ulcer disease) were prescribed lansoprazole 30 mg b.d. on days 1-4, and on day 4 they received in addition tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate 120 mg, tetracycline 250 mg and metronidazole 250 mg at 09.00, 11.00, 13.00, 15.00, 17.00, 19.00, 21.00, 23.00 hours. Repeat endoscopy with biopsies for CLOtest, Giemsa stain and culture was carried out 6 weeks later. RESULTS: Follow-up was complete. Overall cure rate (all three biopsy-based tests negative) was 26/46 (57%; 95% CI: 41-71%). Antibiotic sensitivity was available in 42. Thirty-nine carried a metronidazole sensitive strain and 23/39 (59%) were cured, three carried a resistant strain and therapy failed in all. Three out of four in whom susceptibility was unknown were cured. Metronidazole resistance was induced in 8 out of 16 with a sensitive strain. Only one patient (3%) reported severe side effects. CONCLUSIONS: This convenient quadruple regimen showed that a short contact time is sufficient to kill H. pylori in vivo. Since 57% of patients are cured with a 14-h treatment, a slightly longer treatment duration may increase the cure rate to above 90%.
