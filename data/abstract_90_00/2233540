415 nonimmune patients with acute signs and symptoms of falciparum malaria have been examined. The study has shown that 2/3 of patients had a moderate form of the disease, a severe form was noted only in 4.57% of patients. Classical symptoms of malaria--chill, body ache, headache--were observed only in half of the patients, 1/3 of patients had so-called masks of malaria--respiratory catarrh, pharyngitis, allergy, symptoms of enterocolitis. Early diagnosis and complex treatment with chloroquine or chloroquine combined with fansidar (1.16% of patients) promoted to a rapid improvement of the clinical symptoms and to favourable outcome. No fatal outcomes or severe complications have been observed. The mean duration of the disability period was 8.9 days. The first-degree resistance to chloroquine (clinical data) was noted in 11 patients, repeated manifestations of malaria occurred in 8.12% of patients and were more severe.
