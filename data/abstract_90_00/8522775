Six strains each of Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis were investigated with respect to their resistance to heat and sodium hypochlorite. All enterococci survived the temperatures and holding times specified by the Department of Health (DoH) for the disinfection of 'foul and used' or 'infected' linen (65 degrees C for 10 min or 71 degrees C for 3 min). In addition, three strains (one E. faecium and two E. faecalis) could withstand 150 ppm available chlorine for 5 min, the treatment suggested by the DoH for the disinfection of heat labile materials. Further, our results showed that four strains of E. faecium were able to survive the British Standard for heat disinfection of bedpans (80 degrees C for 1 min). The significance of these findings with particular reference to the potential for enterococci to survive and disseminate in the hospital environment is discussed.
