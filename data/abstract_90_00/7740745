Recently, an increased resistance of Campylobacter to fluoroquinolones, a newer class of antimicrobial agents in both human and veterinary medicine, has been reported. Campylobacter isolates (617) from 150 broiler flocks were tested for their susceptibility to cephalothin (control), ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, and the quinolones nalidixic acid, flumequine, enrofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin by a disc diffusion method. Almost complete cross-resistance was found between the quinolones tested. Campylobacter isolates (181, 29%), originating from 55 flocks (37%), were quinolone resistant. Salmonella isolates (94) from 40 flocks were also tested for their antimicrobial susceptibility. Eight isolates (8.5%), from three broiler flocks (7.5%), showed resistance to nalidixic acid and flumequine (and tetracycline), but not to ciprofloxacin or enrofloxacin.
