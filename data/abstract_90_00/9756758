The PSE-4 enzyme is a prototype carbenicillin-hydrolyzing enzyme exhibiting high activity against penicillins and early cephalosporins. To understand the mechanism that modulates substrate profiles and to verify the ability of PSE-4 to extend its substrate specificity toward expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, we used random replacement mutagenesis to generate six random libraries from amino acids 162 to 179 in the Omega loop. This region is known from studies with TEM-1 to be implicated in substrate specificity. It was found that the mechanism modulating ceftazidime hydrolysis in PSE-4 was different from that in TEM-1. The specificity of class 2c carbenicillin-hydrolyzing enzymes could not be assigned to the Omega loop of PSE-4. Analysis of the percentage of functional enzymes revealed that the hydrolysis of ampicillin was more affected than hydrolysis of carbenicillin by amino acid substitutions at positions 162 to 164 and 165 to 167.
