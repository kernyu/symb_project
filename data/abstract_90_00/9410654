Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) rapidly is becoming a significant cause of nosocomial infections. VRE lives in the environment (e.g., bedside tables, side rails, door knobs) for five to seven days, making transmission difficult to eliminate. Patients who are immunosuppressed or are receiving multiple antibiotics are particularly susceptible to developing VRE infections. Nursing management is the cornerstone of prevention and treatment. Nurses need to identify patients at risk, maintain isolation, and educate patients, family members, and other healthcare team members.
