Reports of thrush clinically refractory to azoles in AIDS patients are increasing with the more widespread use of these agents. We studied our own oral preparation of amphotericin B in the treatment of two AIDS patients who developed oral thrush due to Candida glabrata after prolonged fluconazole use. Improvement occurred in both in less than 1 week, with eventual clearing and absence of side effects. Oral amphotericin B may have advantages over alternatives for this increasing problem.
