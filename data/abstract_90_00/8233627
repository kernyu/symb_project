Susceptibility of 213 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated in a general intensive care unit during two years 1989 and 1990 was tested against 11 antibiotics: ticarcillin (TIC), ticarcillin+clavulanic acid (TCC), cefsulodin (CFS), ceftazidime (CAZ), imipenem (IMP), gentamicin (G), tobramycin (TOB), amikacin (AN), ofloxacin (OFX), norfloxacin (NOR) and ciprofloxacin (CIP). Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by disk agar diffusion test and by measuring minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICS using test agar dilution. 65% of strains were isolated from respiratory tract infections. Resistance frequency of this antibiotics was: TIC: 41.3%, TCC: 33.8%, CFS: 26.5%, CAZ: 23.2%, IMP: 11.6%, G: 72.5%, TOB: 46.5%, AN: 12.6%, OFX: 29.3%, NOR: 21.3%, CIP: 17.6%. We observed by measuring CMI that imipenem and amikacin were the most active antibiotics. From 1989 et 1990, the increase number of strains resistant to imipenem, amikacin and fluoroquinolones could be explained by massive use of those antibiotics. Besides their high level of resistance, strains isolated in intensive care unit ere characterized by their multiresistance: 24 strains were resistant to 8 of 11 antibiotics tested; four of them showed resistance to all antibiotics the multiresistance of those strains suggest strongly that decreased permeability could be the cause.
