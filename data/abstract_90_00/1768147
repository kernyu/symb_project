A total of 264 bacterial strains tentatively or definitely classified as Vibrio anguillarum were examined. The strains were isolated from diseased or healthy Norwegian fish after routine autopsy. With the exception of five isolates from wild saithe (Pollachius virens), the strains originated from nine different species of farmed fish. The bacteria were subjected to morphological, physiological, and biochemical studies, numerical taxonomical analyses, serotyping by slide agglutination and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, DNA-plasmid profiling, and in vitro antimicrobial drug susceptibility testing. The results of the microbiological studies were correlated to anamnestic information. The bacterial strains were identified as V. anguillarum serovar O1 (n = 132), serovar O2 (n = 89), serovar O4 (n = 2), serovar O8 (n = 1), and not typeable (n = 1) as well as Vibrio splendidus biovar I (n = 36) and biovar II (n = 1), Vibrio tubiashii (n = 1), and Vibrio fischerii (n = 1). V. anguillarum serovar O1 or O2 was isolated in 176 out of 179 cases of clinical vibriosis in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). V. anguillarum serovar O1 was the only serovar isolated from salmonid fish species other than Atlantic salmon, while V. anguillarum serovar O2 was isolated from all marine fish suffering from vibriosis. A 48-Mda plasmid was isolated from all V. anguillarum serovar O1 isolates examined. Serovar O2 isolates did not harbor any plasmids. Resistance against commonly used antibiotic compounds was not demonstrated among V. anguillarum isolates. Neither V. splendidus biovar I nor other V. anguillarum-related species appeared to be of clinical importance among salmonid fish.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
