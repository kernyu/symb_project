Membrane permeability was examined in liver mitochondria isolated from hypothyroid rats. It was found that such a thyroid status provides substantial protection from membrane leakiness as induced by Ca2+ loading. Thus, these mitochondria are less prone to undergoing permeability transition than mitochondria from euthyroid rats. The above conclusion was reached on the basis of the following two facts: (1) hypothyroid mitochondria are not strictly dependent on the addition of ADP to retain high matrix Ca2+ concentrations, and (2) carboxyatractyloside, antimycin A or carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenyl hydrazone failed to promote Ca2+ efflux. We discuss the possible relevance of the low content of membrane cardiolipin as well as the low expression of the adenine nucleotide translocase as responsible for the resistance to membrane damage.
