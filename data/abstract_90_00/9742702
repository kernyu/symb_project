The distribution of the antiseptic-resistance genes qacE and qacE delta 1, originally isolated from Gram-negative bacteria, was studied in a large number of Gram-positive bacteria by a method that included the polymerase chain reaction. A total of 151 strains of Staphylococcus and Enterococcus, isolated from clinical sources and obtained from the Japanese Collection of Microorganisms, was used in this analysis. We found the qacE delta 1 gene in 36 of 103 strains of Staphylococcus and in nine of 48 strains of Enterococcus. All of the strains in which we detected the qacE delta 1 gene were clinical isolates. The qacE gene was not detected in any of the strains examined in this study. The nucleotide sequences of the qacE delta 1 genes from the strains of Staphylococcus and Enterococcus were identical to that of the gene located on integron InC in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These results indicate that the antiseptic-resistance gene qacE delta 1 is present in Gram-positive, as well as Gram-negative, bacteria.
