Isolation of Mycobacterium xenopi from the respiratory tract may indicate pneumonia, often clinically indistinguishable from tuberculosis. Resistance to the classic antituberculous drugs renders the treatment of these infections problematic. We report on a case of cavernous pneumonia caused by M. xenopi in a 36-year-old male with natural killer cell deficiency but without severe immunodeficiency. He was successfully treated with a novel triple-drug combination comprising clarithromycin, sparfloxacin, and rifabutin. An impressive subsequent regression of pathological pulmonary changes was observed, and mycobacteria could no longer be detected. The therapeutic potential of clarithromycin and sparfloxacin in the treatment of M. xenopi infections is discussed.
