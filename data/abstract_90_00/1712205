Viral transformation and DNA-transfection assays were employed to investigate the differential toxic effect of caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), an extract of the honeybee hive product propolis, on adenovirus type 5 (Ad5)-transformed cloned rat embryo fibroblast (CREF) cells. CAPE inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, both de novo and carcinogen-enhanced transformation of CREF cells by H5hr1, the cold-sensitive (cs) host-range mutant of Ad5. CAPE had a selective inhibitory effect on Ad5-induced transformation when a wild-type (wt) Ad5 E1A gene or a cs Ad5 E1A gene (at 37 degrees C, but not at 32 degrees C) was cotransfected into CREF cells with a dominant-acting bacterial hygromycin-resistance gene. A requirement for the expression of Ad5 E1A-encoded mRNAs and transforming proteins and sensitivity to CAPE was demonstrated using CREF cells stably transformed by a cs Ad5 E1A gene and an Ad5 E1A gene under the transcriptional control of a mouse mammary tumor virus promoter. To distinguish between the effects of the two Ad5 E1A-encoded proteins of 289 amino acids (aa) and 243 aa, CREF cells were stably transformed with cDNAs encoding either the 13S or the 12S E1A mRNA. CREF cells expressing the 13S E1A-encoded 289-aa protein were more sensitive to the growth-suppressing effect of CAPE than cells producing only the 12S E1A-encoded 243-aa protein. However, the growth-suppressing and toxic effects of CAPE were greatest in cells expressing both E1A-encoded transforming proteins. Analysis of the effect of CAPE on E1A and beta-actin gene expression in wt and cs E1A and H5hr1-transformed CREF cells indicated that low levels of CAPE, which were growth suppressive, did not selectively suppress E1A expression. These results demonstrated that cellular changes induced in CREF cells by the 13S E1A-encoded 289-aa protein of Ad5, when expressed alone or in combination with the 12S E1A-encoded 243-aa protein, rendered transformed cells sensitive to the growth-suppressing and toxic effects of CAPE.
