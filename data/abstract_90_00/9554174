We report the activity of LY333328 against 35 clinical isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (including organisms carrying the vanA, vanB, vanC-1, and vanC-2/3 genes, as determined by PCR), 33 clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and 29 clinical isolates of high-level penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae. All isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were inhibited by 2 micrograms/mL LY333328, and 8 micrograms/mL LY333328 was bactericidal against all isolates tested. All isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus were inhibited by 1 microgram/mL LY333328, and 4 micrograms/mL LY333328 was bactericidal against all methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates tested. All isolates of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae were inhibited by < 0.125 microgram/mL LY333328, and 0.25 microgram/mL LY333328 was bactericidal against all S. pneumoniae isolates tested. LY333328 is a promising new glycopeptide antimicrobial agent.
