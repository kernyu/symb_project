We determined a partial sequence of the Klebsiella pneumoniae parC gene, including the region analogous to the quinolone resistance-determining region of the Escherichia coli gyrA gene, and examined 26 clinical strains of K. pneumoniae for an association of alterations in GyrA and ParC with susceptibilities to quinolones. The study suggests that in K. pneumoniae DNA gyrase is a primary target of quinolones and that ParC alterations play a complementary role in the development of higher-level fluoroquinolone resistance.
