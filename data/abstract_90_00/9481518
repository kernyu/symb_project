Three thermophilic bacteria strains, designated strain BS1, BS2 and BS3, resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics, and leaving at an optimal temperature for growth of about 50 degrees C, were isolated from traditional baths in Meknes-city in Morocco. Physiological and biochemical studies showed that these organisms belong to Gram positive Bacilli. They could not be identified with the Bergey's Manuel of Systematic Bacteriology (1986). The dosage of beta-lactamase during the exponential growth phase has revealed that the strain BS3 produces a maximal amount of this enzyme. Studies aimed at determining the optimal conditions for incubation and growth have been performed in order to optimize the excretion of beta-lactamase by BS3 cells and thus facilitate the purification and and characterization of this enzyme.
