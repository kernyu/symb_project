The internal concentrations of the cations H+, Na+, K+ and the intracellular ATP concentration were measured on B succinogenes adapted to the presence of the ionophore monensin (0.5 microM). Adapted bacteria were still able to regulate the intracellular concentrations of Na+ and K+, but their internal pH and ATP concentration were lower than in control bacteria.
