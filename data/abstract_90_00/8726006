Aminoglycoside adaptive resistance was characterized in one reference strain and four clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Adaptive resistance was initiated with a 2-h gentamicin or tobramycin exposure at the MIC. Each P. aeruginosa strain demonstrated an adaptive-resistance period of between 8 and 12 h when tested with both aminoglycosides. Aminoglycoside adaptive resistance was shown to correlate with a decrease in [3H] gentamicin accumulation and a small (5%) but significant (P < 0.05) reduction in proton motive force. The mean generation time of P. aeruginosa during peak levels of adaptive resistance (i.e., maximum reductions in aminoglycoside killing) was not significantly different from that of control organisms (P < 0.05). No changes in outer membrane protein or lipopolysaccharide sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis profiles were noted when control, adaptively resistant, and postadaptively resistant cells were compared. Cytoplasmic membrane profiles of adaptively resistant cells, however, demonstrated several band changes when compared with control and postadaptively resistant cells. We conclude that the decrease in aminoglycoside accumulation associated with adaptive resistance in P. aeruginosa may be, in part, a function of reductions in proton motive force and/or cytoplasmic membrane protein changes. However, the importance of these changes requires further investigation.
