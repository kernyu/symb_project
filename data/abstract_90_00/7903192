In an experimental study, endothelial cell seeding on glutaraldehyde-fixed and detoxified bioprosthetic tissue, suitable for valve fabrication, was investigated in vitro. These findings were compared to spontaneous endothelial cell ingrowth on vascular grafts fabricated from the same materials. Special consideration was given to the quality of cell attachment with regards to improved shear stress resistance in the endothelial layer covering the bioprosthetic surface. On glutaraldehyde detoxified bovine pericardium, in vitro endothelial cell seeding resulted in uninhibited cell proliferation, but the cells were loosely bound to the underlying tissue. In vivo, endothelial cells grew spontaneously over the surface of vascular implants in direct contact with the bioprosthetic material. In contrast to standard fixed bovine pericardium, a significant decrease in thrombotic appositions could be observed. Cells exhibited intensive production of extracellular matrix, which renders the method of spontaneous in vivo cell ingrowth as the most promising approach for further research.
