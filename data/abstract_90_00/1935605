Most cases of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis respond well to chemotherapy. The standard regimen is isoniazid + rifampicin daily for 6 months, with the addition of pyrazinamide for the first 2 months. Chemotherapy is given for 9 or 12 months in meningitis, and in some cases of lymphadenitis and bone and joint disease. If initial drug resistance is suspected, either streptomycin or ethambutol should be added to the first phase of treatment. Only a minority of cases need surgical treatment but surgical diagnostic procedures are often useful. Corticosteroids are not recommended for routine use but can be valuable in lymphadenitis, meningitis, pericarditis and genito-urinary disease.
