It has been shown that hepatitis C virus (HCV) populations in infected individuals are composed of quasispecies with diverse mutations. The analysis of these variants may reveal mechanisms of the persistence of HCV infection, carcinogenesis and resistance to antiviral therapy. Recently, genetic features of interferon-resistant HCV have been elucidated through the analysis of interferon-resistant quasispecies, making it possible to predict interferon efficacy by detecting interferon-resistant strains.
