The transformation of Mycobacterium aurum and Mycobacterium smegmatis with the Gram-negative RSF1010-derived cosmid pJRD215 is described. The plasmid is stably maintained in both species and the antibiotic resistance determinants for kanamycin and streptomycin are expressed. Southern blot analysis shows that rearrangements take place both in M. aurum and in M. smegmatis. The use of pJRD215 in mycobacterial cloning systems is discussed.
