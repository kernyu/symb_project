Fungal resistance is caused by an acquisition of intrinsically resistant species, by selection of resistant strains from a population or by mutation of an initially susceptible strain. According to different classes of antimycotics there are different resistance mechanisms: differences in the uptake mechanisms, drug target alterations, mostly the ergosterol-biosynthesis pathway, and the efflux or pumping mechanisms to the outside.
