Strategies to reduce the spread of hospital-acquired microorganisms resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents are discussed. Because hospitals have experienced a rapid increase in the incidence of infection and colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in the past 5 years, the Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued recommendations for preventing the spread of vancomycin resistance. Controlling VRE dissemination in pediatric patients requires prompt detection of VRE by microbiology laboratories, education of staff and families about VRE, use of infection control measures to prevent person-to-person VRE transmission, and prudent vancomycin use.
