As part of a multicenter collaborative study the relative frequency of enteropathogenic agents in children less than 5 years of age with acute diarrhea was determined. Rates of isolation were similar as regards sex, age, and season. The frequency of polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) in the stools was significantly higher among patients requiring admission in comparison with ambulatory patients. Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) was isolated more frequently in that group in comparison with outpatients (p < 0.001), mainly among children less than 5 months of age. The most prevalent agents were EPEC (26.1%), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) (9.7%), Shigella (8.5%), Rotavirus (5.1%), Giardia (3.6%), Campylobacter (3.2%), and Salmonella (2.4%). The EPEC predominant serogroups were 0 111, 0 55, 0 26, and 0 119. ETEC serotypes 0 153:H45 and 0 128:H21 were more often isolated. The predominant species in the genus Shigella were S. flexneri (80.5%), and S. sonnei (9.5%); in the genus Campylobacter, the species were C. jejuni (81.3%), and C. coli (18.7%). Shigella was clearly related to the presence of PMN in the faeces, in children less than 5 months old. Campylobacter was more frequent in ambulatory patients more than one year of age. Rotavirus was found predominantly in autumn and winter. Salmonella and ETEC were more frequent in summer. Giardia was associated with weight loss. In about 10% of the cases there were simultaneous mixed isolations of two or more agents. Salmonella isolates were sensitive to the majority of antimicrobial agents probed. Many Shigella and E. coli were resistant to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and ampicillin (40-80%). Nearly all enterobacteria were sensitive to gentamicin and norfloxacin.
