We examined in vitro susceptibilities of 3,109 isolates belonging to 5 species of Proteeae to 2 penicillins, 5 cephems and 2 aminoglycosides. The isolates were collected from 69 hospital laboratories throughout Japan between 1986 and 1988. Minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined using the agar dilution method with inoculation of 10(8) cells/ml of bacteria. Proteus mirabilis had marked susceptibilities to the penicillins and cephems tested. Proteus vulgaris and Morganella morganii were similar in their susceptibilities to ampicillin (ABPC), piperacillin (PIPC), cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM), latamoxef, gentamicin (GM) and netilmicin (NTL), but M. morganii was slightly more resistant to cefmetazole and ceftizoxime (CZX) than P. vulgaris. Providencia rettgeri also had a susceptibility pattern similar to that of P. vulgaris, except that P. rettgeri showed higher resistances to CZX, GM and NTL. Providencia stuartii had a very similar susceptibility pattern to P. rettgeri, but P. stuartii was much more resistant to GM and NTL than the latter. Some major differences on susceptibilities were clearly evident among the 5 species of Proteeae tested. Notable species-specific differences included higher susceptibilities of P. mirabilis to ABPC, PIPC, CEZ and CTM than others and stronger resistances of P. rettgeri and P. stuartii to GM and NTL.
