Since 1993, trends in perinatal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission have been monitored by use of chart review of patients identified at a central diagnostic laboratory. In the population studied, either pre- or postnatal antiretroviral therapy to the infant increased from 21% in 1993 to 95% in 1997. Concurrently, the number of HIV-infected infants declined from 25 in 1993 to 4 in 1997. The complete Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group Protocol 076 regimen was the most effective in reducing transmission (3.1%). Twenty-two of 35 infants who became infected in 1995-1997 had mothers who did not receive antiretroviral therapy, although counseling practices improved with time. In 1995, 87% of the mothers of HIV-seropositive infants were counseled, whereas in 1997, 96% were counseled (P<.005). None of 59 infants tested had high-level phenotypic zidovudine resistance, although 5 (8.8%) of 57 infants had virus isolates with at least one mutation in the reverse transcriptase gene associated with reduced phenotypic susceptibility to zidovudine.
