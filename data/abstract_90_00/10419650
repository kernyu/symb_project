We have demonstrated that ingested murine interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) suppressed clinical relapse in chronic relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (CR-EAE), decreased inflammation and suppressed the adoptive transfer of EAE, and is a biological response modifier in patients with multiple sclerosis. We examined the relative levels of the Mx mRNA signal using semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis on splenocytes from mice and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from man after IFN-alpha ingestion. Both mice and man demonstrated inducible levels of Mx mRNA after ingesting IFN-alpha. Murine spleen T cells and CD8(+)T cells also demonstrated upregulation of Mx mRNA. Murine whole splenocytes demonstrated upregulation of Mx mRNA after IFN-alpha ingestion of 10 and 100 U, but not after 0, 1000, 5000 U. Ingested IFN-alpha acts via established pathways of type 1 IFN signalling.
