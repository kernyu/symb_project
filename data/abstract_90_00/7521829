Quinolones are a class of antibiotics structurally related to nalidixic acid. They exhibit bactericidal activity primarily by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase. The early quinolones had a limited spectrum of activity, low potency, high frequency of spontaneous bacterial resistance, low serum drug concentrations and short half-lives, which virtually restricted their use to urinary tract infection. The new fluorinated quinolones differ from their predecessors in their broad antibacterial spectrum, including both Gram-negative and Gram-positive aerobic, and facultative anaerobic bacteria as well as many Mycobacterium spp., Chlamydia spp., Legionella spp. and Mycoplasma spp., in addition to many strains of bacteria that are multiresistant to beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides. They also exhibit high potency, a low incidence of resistance, high oral bioavailability, extensive tissue penetration, low protein binding and long elimination half-lives. They are generally well tolerated apart from some gastrointestinal disturbance and rashes, including photosensitive eruptions and a propensity to cause central nervous system excitation. Clinically important interactions include those with antacids, theophylline, fenbufen and warfarin. Potential toxic effects include cartilage damage, ocular toxicity, teratogenicity and impairment of spermatogenesis. The role of fluoroquinolones continues to widen, encompassing infections of the urinary tract, respiratory tract, skin and soft tissues, bone and joints, infections in immunocompromised patients, sexually transmitted diseases, infectious diarrhoea, gynaecological infections and surgical prophylaxis. The convenience of oral therapy is an added advantage of the new fluoroquinolones.
