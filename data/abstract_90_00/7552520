The Inter-Company Collaboration for AIDS Drug Development (ICC) represents a collaborative effort among member companies to facilitate the conduct of clinical trials on AIDS drugs. One of the goals of the ICC is to expedite the development of combination antiretroviral therapy through data and compound sharing. Recently, the ICC formed a consensus master protocol to evaluate rapidly the safety and efficacy of triple-drug combinations of antiretroviral therapy for treatment of HIV-infected patients. This concept builds upon historical work with combination chemotherapy that resulted in treatments to successfully control chronic immunosuppressive, infectious or malignant diseases, such as tuberculosis, leprosy, childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and Hodgkin's lymphoma. Because of limitations on potency and the continuing emergence of drug resistance seen with use of currently available antiretroviral agents in monotherapy and two-drug combination regimens, triple-combination regimens should represent a more promising approach to maximize antiviral activity, maintain long-term efficacy, and reduce the incidence of drug resistance. The ICC master protocol is a randomized, controlled, double-blind study with a treatment duration of 52 weeks. Patients eligible to enroll in this study must have documented HIV infection, with CD4 counts between 200 and 500 cells/mm3, and no history of antiretroviral therapy. The first four triple-drug combinations will be evaluated in two trials. These regimens have been selected based on encouraging data from laboratory and clinical studies. Each ICC trial will consist of three arms, with 75 patients per arm. Protocol ICC 001 will include AZT + zalcitabine (ddC) + saquinavir, AZT + ddC + nevirapine, and AZT + ddC as the control arm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
