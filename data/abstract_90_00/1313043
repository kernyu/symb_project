The standard selective Legionella medium that contains cefamandole failed to grow legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, subtype Bellingham, from a sputum sample from a patient with nosocomial Legionnaires' disease; the isolate did grow on a similar selective medium that substitutes vancomycin for cefamandole. Two Bellingham isolates from this patient's hospital environment also failed to grow when tested on the cefamandole medium. We tested 106 additional L. pneumophila serogroup 1 isolates that belonged to nine different monoclonal antibody subtypes and demonstrated that susceptibility to cefamandole was rare (10%) and limited to the Bellingham subtype. The diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease may be missed unless the culture protocol includes both a nonselective medium and a selective medium that does not contain cefamandole. In vitro susceptibility to cefamandole also provided an epidemiologic marker that linked a water source for a patient to nosocomial Legionnaires' disease.
