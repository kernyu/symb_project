Anisomycin, an antibiotic that specifically inhibits the peptidyl transfer function of eukaryotic ribosomes, has been used to select resistant mutants in Tetrahymena thermophila. A mutation conferring anisomycin resistance (an-r) has been localized to a 1.2-kb fragment of the large subunit ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene by transformation via microinjection. A single base pair change was detected within this region. Nine independently isolated an-r mutants had the same base pair change. T. thermophila strains that are homozygous for this mutation are cold sensitive, unable to mate and grossly abnormal in cell morphology.
