A 67-yr-old patient with septic shock caused by gram-positive infection fell into circulatory collapse. Direct hemoperfusion with an endotoxin-removing column was then carried out for 120 min. As a result, blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance increased significantly during this therapy. Cardiac output changed from hyperdynamic to normodynamic, and plasma endotoxin level decreased. After this treatment, the patient recovered. From this experience, we consider that the endotoxin-removing column may be effective for septic shock patients.
