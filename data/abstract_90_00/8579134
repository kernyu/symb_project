Infections with nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are being identified with increasing frequency, but the otologic manifestations of NTM infection are not well defined. Mycobacterium abscessus is a ubiquitous rapidly growing mycobacterium (RGM) known to cause disease by inoculation after trauma. Though reported following open heart and breast augmentation surgery, it is not recognized as a cause of sporadic post-tympanostomy tube otorrhea. This report presents detailed clinical information on six sporadic cases and partial information on 15 additional cases of ear infection caused by RGM over the past 7 years. Of these, 20 of 21 cases (95%) were attributable to M. abscessus, 14 of 21 (67%) subjects lived in a southern coastal state and 16 of 16 with available histories had previously undergone placement of tympanostomy tubes. Each isolate exhibited resistance to many antibiotics, with 50 percent exhibiting high level mutational resistance to aminoglycosides related to prior topical aminoglycoside use. Therapy was difficult, requiring debridement and prolonged antibiotic therapy. M. abscessus is a problematic infection requiring specific diagnosis and treatment and should be sought as a cause of refractory post-tympanostomy tube otorrhea.
