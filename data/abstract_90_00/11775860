OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of molecular biotechnology for direct, rapid detection of rifampicin-resistance mutations in M. tuberculosis. METHODS: 45 M. tuberculosis clinical isolates and 70 sputum samples were tested by polymerase chain reaction-single stranded conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) technique. M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv was used as control and compared with the result of susceptibility test. DNA sequencing was also performed in some of the strains. RESULTS: All tested susceptible isolates displayed identical SSCP patterns. Of 29 RFP resistance strains, 26(90%) had distinct mobility shifts that can be discriminated from susceptible isolates. 9 sputum samples which were succeasfully evaluated by PCR-SSCP showed concordant result acquired from BACTEC 460 method. As the result of DNA sequencing, it was observed that seven RFP-resistance phenotype of M. tuberculosis strains had missense mutation, in which 5 isolates displayed TCG-->TTG or CAG mutations at codon 531.2 had CAC-->TAC mutation at codon 526. On the other hand, one strain which was susceptible to rifampin exhibited identical nucleotide alignment to the sequence of rpoB gene. CONCLUSIONS: PCR-SSCP could be used as a method for simple, rapid, and reliable detection of rifampicin-resistance mutations in clinical samples of M. tuberculosis.
