There has been recently a rise in tuberculosis morbidity rates in the countries of Western and Eastern Europe, in the USA. At the same time high tuberculosis morbidity and mortality rates have remained in the developing countries. Along with tuberculosis endogenic reactivation in adults, there is exogenic superinfection is observed, which causes tuberculosis, including that by multidrug resistant mycobacteria. In the latter, patients were found to have a prolong disease which is characterized by acute progressive forms. This leads to a downward trend in therapeutical efficiency. The high onset drug resistance requires that a combination of 4 or 5 antituberculous agents should be used early in the disease.
