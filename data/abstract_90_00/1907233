Treatment of dentin hypersensitivity will become of increasing importance in the daily practice of dentistry. The goal of any therapy should be the closure of opened dentinal tubules. The present study made an SEM evaluation of the effect of anti-sensitive toothpastes on root dentin with regard to the superficial changes and possible penetration by toothpaste particles. Further, the study performed an evaluation of the wear-resistance of two dentin-bonded resins during brushing, using the same anti-sensitive toothpastes. Having induced coverage of the dentinal tubules with the toothpastes (Sensodyne, Emoform and Macleans Sensitive), no particles were found within the tubules. The application of dentin-bonded resins seems an alternative solution for treating dentin hypersensitivity.
