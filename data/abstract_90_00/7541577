T cell homeostasis and CD4/CD8 ratios are normally reestablished by apoptotic clearance of activated T cells after immune stimulation. In allograft recipients with cytomegalovirus infection, CD8 lymphocytosis persists after negativation of viral cultures, contrary to immunocompetent hosts. We investigated the expression of Bcl-2 protein, an intracellular suppressor of apoptosis, and of CD95 (APO-1/Fas), a membrane inducer of apoptosis, in peripheral blood lymphocytes from 45 solid organ recipients. During the viremic phase of CMV infection, we found absence or diminished expression of Bcl-2 protein and increased expression of CD95 antigen in activated CD8+ T cells. Opposite evolution of these molecular regulators of apoptosis was reflected by the presence of 10-25% of apoptotic lymphocytes with fragmented DNA, as shown by both in situ nick translation and electrophoresis. Normalization of Bcl-2 expression was progressive over several months but still lower than in uninfected allograft recipients. These results suggest that the initial evolution of CMV infection in allograft recipients resembles acute viral infection in immunocompetent hosts. Conversely, we showed that overexpression of Bcl-2 protein in lymphocytes from uninfected allograft recipients, and culture of unstimulated normal lymphocytes with 0.5 micrograms/ml cyclosporine led to an increase in the expression of intracellular Bcl-2. This up-regulation of Bcl-2 protein by cyclosporine suggests the acquisition of resistance to apoptosis. Thus, the reversion of balance between T cell death and survival after acute CMV infection might be impeded by cyclosporine. Combination of CMV latent infection and cyclosporine therapy appears therefore critical to shift the homeostatic maintenance of the peripheral lymphocyte compartment toward persistingly high numbers of CD8+ T cells.
