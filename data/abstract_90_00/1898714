Human HeLa cells resistant to cisplatin were established by stepwise selection. The selected cells showed a 15- to 20-fold cisplatin resistance (CPR) at the dose level resulting in 50% inhibition. These cells were cross-resistant to mitomycin C, melphalan, and ethyl methanesulfonate but not to Adriamycin, colchicine, or vinblastine. The expression of cisplatin-damaged plasmid DNA carrying the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene after its transfection into CPR cells was enhanced by approximately 3-fold. This did not correlate with the degree of CPR. However, the development of the CPR phenotype paralleled the enhanced CAT activity. The addition of aphidicolin (an inhibitor of DNA alpha-polymerase) to CPR cells effectively diminished the enhanced CAT activity and CPR. These studies have identified an enhanced host cell reactivation of the damaged plasmid in the acquisition of CPR, suggesting that DNA repair is a potential mechanism for the development of CPR phenotype in human cells.
