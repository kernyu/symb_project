OBJECTIVE: To determine efficacy of fenbendazole for treatment of giardiasis in calves. ANIMALS: Twenty male and 15 female Holstein calves (100 to 180 kg), naturally infected with Giardia sp. PROCEDURE: In vitro fenbendazole susceptibility and resistance development was determined for a ruminant Giardia isolate by use of an adherence assay. Calves were treated as follows: group 1, a single administration of 5 mg of fenbendazole/kg of body weight; group 2, a single administration of 10 mg of fenbendazole/kg; group 3, 5 mg of fenbendazole/kg, every 24 hours for 3 days; group 4, 10 mg of fenbendazole/kg, every 24 hours for 3 days; group 5, 20 mg of fenbendazole/kg, every 24 hours for 3 days; group 6, 0.833 mg of fenbendazole/kg, every 24 hours for 6 days; and group 7, saline solution. Fecal Giardia cysts were counted on days -3 through -1 and 1 through 7, 9, 11, 13, 21, and 28 by use of sucrose gradient concentration and staining with a fluorescent monoclonal antibody. RESULTS: The 50% adherence inhibition concentration was 0.024 +/- 0.002 microgram/ml, and resistance could not be detected after 5 weeks of continuous culture at sublethal concentration of fenbendazole (0.01 microgram/kg). Fenbendazole was 100% effective in eliminating cysts from the feces within 6 days for calves in treatment groups 2-6. Reinfection was observed in some calves within the 28-day study period. CONCLUSIONS: Fenbendazole is effective in the elimination of Giardia infections in calves, but repeat treatments may be required in reinfected animals. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Fenbendazole is an effective and economical treatment for Giardia-associated diarrhea and growth rate reduction in calves.
