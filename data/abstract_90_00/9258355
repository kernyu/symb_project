Lipophilic esters of 3'-azido-3'-deoxy-5'-O-(carboxyphosphinyl)thymidine (PFA-AZT) were synthesized and tested for antiretroviral activity in CD4+ HT4-6C cells infected with either wild-type HIV-1LAI, a PFA-resistant strain encoding a single-point mutation in reverse transcriptase (E89K), or an AZT-resistant clinical isolate (A018-post). Arbuzov condensation of 1-octadecyl, 1-eicosanyl, and 1-docosanyl chloroformate with trimethyl phosphite yielded the corresponding dimethyl long-chain alkyl triesters of PFA. Selective removal of one methyl group from the triesters with sodium iodide yielded monosodium salts, whereas treatment with bromotrimethylsilane cleaved both methyl groups while leaving the long-chain alkyl group intact. Neutralization of the resulting [(alkyloxy)carbonyl]phosphonic acids with 2 equiv of sodium methoxide afforded disodium salts of the phosphonic acid moiety. Similar chemistry was used to obtain the mono- and disodium salts of the cholesterol ester of PFA. Reaction of the triesters with phosphorous pentachloride, followed by coupling with AZT and O-demethylation with sodium iodide, afforded 3'-azido-3'-deoxy-5'-O-[[(1-octadecyloxy)carbonyl]phosphinyl ]thymidine (9a), 3'-azido-3'-deoxy-5'-O-[[(1-eicosanyloxy)carbonyl]phosphinyl ]thymidine (9b), 3'-azido-3'-deoxy-5'-O-[[(1-docosanyloxy)carbonyl]phosphinyl ]thymidine (9c), and 3'-azido-3'-deoxy-5'-O-[[(3 beta-cholest-5-enyloxy)carbonyl]phosphinyl]thymidine (9d). Concentrations of 9a-d found to inhibit replication of wild-type HIV-1LAI by 50% (EC50 values) as measured in a plaque reduction assay were in the 0.1-0.3 microM range as compared with 0.013 microM for AZT and 133 microM for PFA. The concentration at which toxicity was observed in 50% of the host cells (TC50 values) as measured by a visual grading scale of cellular morphology was 10 microM for 9a and 9d, 32 microM for 9b, and 320 microM for 9c. Thus, the TC50/EC50 ratio or selectivity index (SI) was 100 for 9a, 230 for 9b, and 1000 for 9c but only 33 for 9d, suggesting that the straight-chained fatty alcohol esters were more therapeutically selective. Similar TC50 and SI values were obtained for rapidly dividing CEM lymphoblasts as for HT4-6C cells. In assays against E89K, 9a-c had mean EC50 values of 0.13, 0.009, and 0.17 microM, whereas the EC50 of PFA was > 1000 microM and that of AZT was 0.009 microM; thus, E89K was highly resistant to PFA but not cross-resistant to either AZT or the lipophilic PFA-AZT conjugates. In viral replication assays against the A018C-post isolate, the mean EC50 values of 9a-c were 0.30, 0.53, and 0.77 microM as compared with 2.9 microM for AZT and 65 microM for PFA; thus, the virus recovered from a patient pretreated with AZT was not cross-resistant to either PFA or 9a-c. A notable feature of these results was that, in addition to being > 1000-fold more potent than PFA against the PFA-resistant mutant, the lipophilic PFA-AZT conjugates were more potent than PFA, as well as AZT, against AZT-resistant HIV-1.
