The authors suggest new methods for the choice of drugs and physiotherapeutic modalities for the treatment of female genital inflammations, based on the suppression of the agents' antilysozymic activities, factors of the agent intracellular persistence. Clinical trials of these methods in 91 patients have shown their high efficacy: the incidence of complete remissions has increased by 60.7%, incidence of disease recurrences reduced by 53%, and remission periods in chronic patients were prolonged by 2.5-3 times (from 0.5-1 year to 2.5-3 years).
