Susceptibility of 230 penicillin- and erythromycin-susceptible and -resistant pneumococci to HMR 3647 (RU 66647), a new ketolide, was tested by agar dilution, and results were compared with those of erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin, rokitamycin, clindamycin, pristinamycin, ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, doxycycline, chloramphenicol, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, imipenem, and vancomycin. HMR 3647 was very active against all strains tested, with MICs at which 90% of the strains were inhibited (MIC90s) of 0.03 microg/ml for erythromycin-susceptible strains (MICs, < or =0.25 microg/ml) and 0.25 microg/ml for erythromycin-resistant strains (MICs, > or =1.0 microg/ml). All other macrolides yielded MIC90s of 0.03 to 0.25 and >64.0 microg/ml for erythromycin-susceptible and -resistant strains, respectively. The MICs of clindamycin for 51 of 100 (51%) erythromycin-resistant strains were < or =0.125 microg/ml. The MICs of pristinamycin for all strains were < or =1.0 microg/ml. The MIC90s of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin were 4.0 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, and were unaffected by penicillin or erythromycin susceptibility. Vancomycin and imipenem inhibited all strains at < or =1.0 microg/ml. The MICs of cefuroxime and cefotaxime rose with those of penicillin G. The MICs of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, doxycycline, and chloramphenicol were variable but were generally higher in penicillin- and erythromycin-resistant strains. HMR 3647 had the best kill kinetics of all macrolides tested against 11 erythromycin-susceptible and -resistant strains, with uniform bactericidal activity (99.9% killing) after 24 h at two times the MIC and 99% killing of all strains at two times the MIC after 12 h for all strains. Pristinamycin showed more rapid killing at 2 to 6 h, with 99.9% killing of 10 of 11 strains after 24 h at two times the MIC. Other macrolides showed significant activity, relative to the MIC, against erythromycin-susceptible strains only.
