The Stichting Werkgroep Antibioticabeleid (SWAB, Foundation Antibiotic Policy Team) issued guidelines for empirical antimicrobial therapy in the hospital of sepsis in adults. A distinction is made between sepsis in patients with and patients without neutropenia. Patients without neutropenia are subdivided according to the setting where they contracted sepsis: at home, in the hospital or in the intensive-care unit. Because of the diversity in antibiotic spectrum of the different classes of cephalosporins, they can be used in all the categories of sepsis. The use of antibiotics with a very broad spectrum, like carbapenems and piperacillin-tazobactam, or antibiotics which can be applied in infections with microorganisms difficult to treat, like quinolones and glycopeptides, is limited in the empirical treatment of sepsis in order to combat development of resistance. It is crucial to streamline antibiotic therapy as soon as the causative agent of the sepsis is known; this includes choosing an antibiotic with the narrowest possible spectrum.
