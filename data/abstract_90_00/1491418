This paper is apparently the first report of resistance of helminths of equids to anthelmintics in South Africa. While a strain of Cyathostominae from an Arab horse stud near Pretoria showed greatly reduced susceptibility to benzimidazoles in faecal egg reduction tests, ivermectin was apparently still unaffected. It is suggested that integrated methods of control such as alternation of horses and ruminants on pasture and mechanical removal of faeces should be used in addition to anthelmintics.
