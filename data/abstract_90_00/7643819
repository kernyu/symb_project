We reviewed 4,277 sputum cultures performed in our FC patients during antipseudomonas courses of antibiotic therapy. The median age of colonization is 8.6 years, and the chronically infected subjects are 33.65% of all our patients. The most efficient antibiotics were imipenem, aztreonam, ceftazidime and amikacin. Ceftazidime gave the best results in terms of antibiotic resistance.
