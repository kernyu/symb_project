Pyronaridine, a hydroxyanilino-benzonaphthyridine derivative synthesized in 1970, is a new antimalarial compound which has been in use in China for more than 10 years. The drug is highly effective against Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax. Furthermore, it is efficacious in combatting chloroquine-resistant strains of falciparum malaria both in vitro and in vivo, in human patients. Extensive field studies involving several thousand cases have shown that pyronaridine has promising therapeutic value in the treatment of malarial infection, including chloroquine-resistant infections. Pyronaridine given orally, intramuscularly or by intravenous drip is not only effective against malaria but also has low toxicity.
