157 bacterial isolates from cases with urinary tract infections (UTI) were studied for their susceptibility to some of the available quinolones as compared to other commonly used antimicrobial agents in UTI. Resistance to nalidixic acid was observed in 62.4% of isolates whereas for pefloxacin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and lomifloxacin it was 54.7%, 52.5%, 51.5% and 50.3% respectively. Aminoglycosides and third generation cephalosporins showed resistance in fewer isolates. Gentamicin resistance was observed in 21% and corresponding figure for amikacin, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone was 7%, 8.9% and 12.1% respectively. Nitrofurantoin showed resistance in 36.3% of isolates and 48% isolates were resistant to cephalexin. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of quinolones was more than 64 mcg/ml which is > 8 times in resistant strains as compared to sensitive isolates.
