A series of dipyridodiazepinones have been shown to be potent inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase. The lead compound, BI-RG-587, had a 50% inhibitory concentration of 84 nM against HIV-1 reverse transcriptase activity. This compound reduced plaque formation of HIV-1 in HeLa cells expressing the CD4 receptor by 50% at 15 nM. BI-RG-587 at comparable concentrations inhibited the production of p24 antigen following the acute infection of CEM T-lymphoblastoid cells or primary human monocyte-derived macrophages with HIV-1. No inhibitory effects against HIV-2 or against three picornaviruses were detected. Zidovudine (3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine [AZT])-susceptible and AZT-resistant isolates of HIV-1 were equally susceptible to BI-RG-587. AZT and BI-RG-587 exhibited synergistic inhibition of HIV-1BRU at all concentrations examined.
