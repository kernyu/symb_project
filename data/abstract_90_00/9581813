In this study, we examined the ability of wortmannin to modulate chlorambucil (CLB) cytotoxicity in lymphocyte samples from patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). It has been suggested previously that enhanced cross-link repair is a primary mechanism of resistance to nitrogen mustards (NMs) in B-CLL. DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is involved in the repair of double-strand breaks and in rejoining steps in recombination mechanisms. Mutants defective in this process are hypersensitive to alkylating agents. We have recently demonstrated that the activity of DNA-PK is a determinant in the cellular response of B-CLL to CLB. The DNA-PK gene has homology to the P110 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K). Wortmannin, an inhibitor of P110 PI 3-K, also inhibits DNA-PK activity in vitro. We investigated the effect of wortmannin on DNA-PK activity and CLB toxicity in the lymphocytes from 11 patients with B-CLL. Our results demonstrate that DNA-PK activity is decreased after exposure to wortmannin in a dose-dependent manner. Wortmannin, at nontoxic concentrations, synergistically sensitized B-CLL lymphocytes to the effects of CLB. Moreover, we observed a significant correlation when we compared the fold decrease in DNA-PK activity and the synergistic value (I), obtained when wortmannin was used at 0.1 microM. In the resistant B-CLL lymphocyte samples, there was a highly significant correlation between the ability of wortmannin at 0.1 and 0.25 microM to decrease the level of DNA-PK activity and to increase CLB sensitivity. In a model of primary human tumor cells, our findings suggest that the inhibition of DNA-PK activity may be a powerful way to overcome resistance to NMs such as CLB and point to new possibilities to improve the effectiveness of NM therapy.
