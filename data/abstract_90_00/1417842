In this report we show that the adenovirus E3 region 14.7 kDa protein, heat and sodium arsenite, which have been defined previously as inhibitors of cytolysis, inhibit the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF)-induced release of 3H-arachidonic acid from cycloheximide-sensitized C3HA fibroblasts. Since the A23187-induced release of 3H-a.a. was unaffected, our results suggest that these inhibitors provide resistance to lysis by selectively interfering with the lytic response pathway. Our results also show that heat and sodium arsenite can themselves induce the release of 3H-arachidonic acid. These results raise the possibility that stressor-induced resistance to TNF results from the selective desensitization of phospholipase A2.
