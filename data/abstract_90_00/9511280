In the submitted paper the author investigated the effectiveness of cefpirome on Klebsiella pneumoniae strains producing beta-lactamases with an extended spectrum (ESBL). From a total of 1348 examined strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae ESBL production was confirmed in 59 strains (4.4%). Resistance of ESBL-positive strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae to ceftazidime was 83.1%, to cefotaxime 93.2%, while resistance to cefpirome was recorded only in 45.8%.
