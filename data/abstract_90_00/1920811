Although it has been reported that the incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections is extremely low in the obstetrics/gynecology setting, we recently had 5 patients with MRSA infections in the obstetrics/gynecology departments of 4 clinics in Yamagata Prefecture from September 1990 to February 1991. 1) Classified by disease, 4 of the patients had intrauterine infections (3 puerperal intrauterine infections and 1 intrauterine infection) and 1 had a postoperative wound infection. 2) Classified by treatment after the MRSA isolates had been determined, 2 of the patients were given imipenem/cilastatin alone (which turned out to be effective), 2 were given concomitant IPM/CS + quinolone agents (ofloxacin, tosufloxacin; effective) and 1 was given minocycline and OFLX. The principal lessons we learned from these cases are that attention should be paid to the occurrence of MRSA infection even in the obstetrics/gynecology field and that the method of selecting and administering antibiotics to prevent and treat such infections should be reconsidered.
