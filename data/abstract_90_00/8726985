Tuberculosis is re-emerging as a major health threat. Between 1985 and 1990, the number of TB cases reported in the United States increased by more than 15%. In addition, multidrug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis have begun to proliferate. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is extremely difficult to treat and is associated with high mortality rates. Tuberculosis poses tremendous risk to certain populations, including HIV-positive or otherwise immunocompromised patients, the homeless and individuals in correctional facilities or nursing homes. Also, tuberculosis is the sixth most common occupationally acquired infection among laboratory workers. This article traces the etiology of tuberculosis and outlines diagnostic techniques and treatment modalities. It also discusses the role of radiologic technologists in screening patients with suspected tuberculosis.
