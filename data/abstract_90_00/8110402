Eight-three isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae obtained from children hospitalized with several infections in Mexico City and Cuernavaca, and from healthy children attending a day-care center in Cuernavaca, from January to September 1992, were screened for antimicrobial resistance patterns by in vitro susceptibility testing against antimicrobial agents of potential use in the treatment of diseases caused by S. pneumoniae (39 infected patients and 44 from healthy children). 21.6% of strains were resistant to penicillin, 52% of the strains were multiresistant without a commun pattern. Children attending a day-care center had a higher rate of S. pneumoniae strains resistant to one or more antimicrobial than hospitalized children. Serotypes or serogroups 6, 23F, 14 and 19 were most prevalent. There are evidence that strain 23F has an intercontinental link, this strain is associated with disseminated diseases and multiresistance to antimicrobials. The results indicate that changes can occur in the susceptibility of S. pneumoniae and that selective susceptibility testing and epidemiologic studies in hospitalized patients and children in day-care centers are necessary.
