Cefotetan was tested in a multilaboratory study to standardize susceptibility testing criteria and quality control guidelines for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Cefotetan was most active against penicillinase-producing and penicillin-susceptible strains (MIC for 50% of strains tested, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and was least active against the chromosomally resistant isolates (MIC for 50% of strains tested, 2 micrograms/ml). The recommended 30-micrograms disk cefotetan interpretive criteria were as follows: susceptible at greater than or equal to 26 mm (less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml), intermediate at 20 to 25 mm (4 micrograms/ml), and resistant at less than or equal to 19 mm (greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml). Quality control guidelines for agar dilution and disk diffusion tests were established by using numerous GC agar lots, three cefotetan 30-micrograms disk lots, two quality control organisms, and a volume of tests consistent with National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards M23-T guidelines.
