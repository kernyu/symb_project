This study was undertaken to determine the comparative incidence of drug-resistant Vibrio cholerae non-01 in the environmental samples (water, sediment, and plankton) and in the seafood samples (finfish, shellfish, and crustacean) of estuarine, coastal, and mangrove communities. A total of 770 V. cholerae isolates were examined--all of the strains were sensitive to 100% against cephalothin (30 mcg), chloramphenical (30 mcg), and polymyxin-B (300 mcg). However, all of the strains isolated form environmental and seafood samples showed higher resistance (> 25%) to oxytetracycline, streptomycin, sulphadiazine, tetracycline, and to streptomycin, sulphadiazine, and tetracycline, respectively. The percentage of strains resistant to other antimicrobial substances depended on the antibiotic and on the isolation source. Among the isolates tested, a significantly higher number of drug-resistant bacteria was found to occur in water and finfish samples.
