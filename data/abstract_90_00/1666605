Previously we established that the pressure drop along arteries remained nearly constant during the many-fold increase of blood flow rate. In anesthetized rats, functional damage of saphenous artery endothelium eliminates this local regulation of its resistance to flow. Hence, it is determined by the sensitivity of the endothelium to the shear stress. The sensitivity threshold has been estimated to be about 50-70 dyn/sm2. This is considerable more than the values characteristic of the cultured endotheliocytes. Possible reasons of this discrepancy under in vivo and in vitro conditions are discussed.
