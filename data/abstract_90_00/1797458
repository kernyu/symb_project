We determined the efficacy and safety of orally administered ofloxacin, 400 mg twice daily, in the treatment of infections due to multiply-resistant bacteria. Patients (n = 99) were treated for 84 infections in 82 patients evaluable for efficacy with a bacteriologic response of 71%. Organisms treated included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (39), Staphylococcus aureus (11), Serratia marcescens (9), Enterobacter species (7), five each of Escherichia coli, Citrobacter, Salmonella, Klebsiella, and other organisms. The overall clinical responses was 89%: 28 (90%) of 16 osteomyelitis, 10 (83%) of 12 urinary tract infections, and three of three bacteremias. Insomnia occurred in 27% and responded to dose reduction. Resistance of P. aeruginosa to ofloxacin developed in 15% of isolates. No hepatic, renal, or hematologic toxicity developed in spite of long therapy, 283 days. Ofloxacin was an effective therapy for lower respiratory, urinary, bone, and soft tissue infections due to multiply-resistant Gram-negative bacteria and is effective for selected Staphylococcus aureus infections.
