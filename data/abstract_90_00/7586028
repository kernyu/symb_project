Although oxidative stress is involved in many human diseases, little is known of its molecular basis in eukaryotes. In a genetic approach, S. cerevisiae was used to identify elements involved in oxidative stress. By using hydrogen peroxide as an agent for oxidative stress, 34 mutants were identified. All mutants were recessive and fell into 16 complementation groups (pos1 to pos16 for peroxide sensitivity). They corresponded to single mutations as shown by a 2:2 segregation pattern. Enzymes reportedly involved in oxidative stress, such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase, as well as glutathione concentrations, were investigated in wild-type and mutant-cells. One complementation group lacked glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and was shown to be allelic to the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase structural gene ZWF1/MET19. In other mutants all enzymes supposedly involved in oxidative-stress resistance were still present. However, several mutants showed strongly elevated levels of glutathione reductase, gluconate-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. One complementation group, pos9, was highly sensitive to oxidative stress and revealed the same growth phenotype as the previously described yap1/par1 mutant coding for the yeast homologue of mammalian transcriptional activator protein, c-Jun, of the proto-oncogenic AP-1 complex. However, unlike par1 mutants, which showed diminished activities of oxidative-stress enzymes and glutathion level, the pos9 mutants did not reveal any such changes. In contrast to other recombinants between pos mutations and par1, the sensitivity did not further increase in par1 pos9 recombinants, which may indicate that both mutations belong to the same regulating circuit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
