We present four cases of verified late Lyme borreliosis with persistent symptoms and positive serology despite repeated courses of high-dose intravenous penicillin G and/or cephalosporins (including cefoperazone). The patients were now treated with cefoperazone 2 g plus sulbactam 1 g bid iv for 14 days. At the end of treatment, patients were symptom free and have remained so for the following 12 months. By then, IgG against Borrelia burgdorferi had decreased. It is concluded that the addition of beta-lactamase inhibitors to intravenous treatment could be beneficial in Lyme disease refractory to conventional treatment.
