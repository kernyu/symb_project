Sixty-five samples of traditionally made fresh sausages obtained from retail shops and butcher shops in northern Greece were screened for the presence of Salmonella spp. and Listeria spp. Salmonella spp. were found in 20% of the samples tested (54% Salmonella typhimurium and 46% Salmonella enteritidis). The prevalence of Listeria spp. in the samples was 26% (12% Listeria monocytogenes, 76% Listeria innocua, and 12% Listeria welshimeri). Nine of 13 Salmonella isolates were found to be resistant to ampicillin and 4 of 13 showed intermediate sensitivity; 1 of 13 was found to be resistant to chloramphenicol and 1 of 13 to tetracycline. Two strains of Salmonella typhimurum were multiresistant (resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and norfloxacin). All Listeria isolates were sensitive to the antibacterial agents tested that are commonly used for the treatment of human listeriosis.
