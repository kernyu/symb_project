Acute sore throat is a very common pathology, but should not because of this be considered as banal. In effect, the beta-haemolytic streptococcus A, which is responsible for most of the bacteriological etiologies is not only responsible for distant inflammatory complications, acute articular rheumatism (RAA) and glomerulonephritis, which are re-appearing in the United States, but also a fulminating septicemia and a syndrome of visceral failure that makes a grave prognosis for life. Moreover, today, streptococcus A is one of the factors involved in a series of fatal fasciites and necrosing myosites seen in several European countries. Understanding of these complications gives better definition of the causative immunological mechanisms and particularly the adverse role of the "superantigens" of streptococci in the start of an increase in the responses of immunocompetent cells and pro-inflammatory and prothrombic mediators. Finally, availability now of rapid diagnostic tests with monoclonal antibody techniques confirms the presence of streptococci A in acute sore throat and should help the physician to make an etiological diagnosis that takes into account the clinical signs. Unfortunately, these tests are not widely available in France and are not subject to reimbursement. All these factors justify the introduction of an antibiotherapy targetted at streptococcus A in the context of bacterial sore throat. Oral penicillin V (phenoxymethyl penicillin, Oracilline) is always the reference, with an excellent anti-bacterial and clinical activity and without risk of production of strains of streptococcus that are of reduced sensitivity or resistant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
