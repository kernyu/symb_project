Polymyxin B nonapeptide, derived by cleavage of the fatty acyl diaminobutyric acid from polymyxin B, is considerably less toxic, lacks bactericidal activity, and retains its ability to render gram-negative bacteria susceptible to several antibiotics by permeabilizing their outer membranes. The peptide rendered all 53 polymyxin-susceptible strains tested more susceptible to novobiocin, lowering the MIC of novobiocin eightfold or more. The combination of polymyxin B nonapeptide with novobiocin or with erythromycin administered intraperitoneally in multiple doses synergistically protected mice infected with gram-negative bacteria. This combination may be clinically useful because of the apparent rarity of the acquisition of resistance.
