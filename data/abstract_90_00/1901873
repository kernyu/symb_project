Sixty-one cultures of Gram-negative anaerobic rods were isolated from deep periodontal pockets of patients with rapidly progressive periodontitis. Isolates were speciated as Bacteroides gingivalis (18 isolates), Bacteroides intermedius (8), Bacteroides oris (1), Bacteroides gracilis (17) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (17). Their susceptibilities, to seven antimicrobial agents, were determined in vitro using a plate dilution technique. Amoxycillin and amoxycillin with clavulanic acid were active against all isolates (MIC less than 1 mg/l) and proved the most effective agents tested. F. nucleatum and B. gracilis showed resistance to erythromycin; F. nucleatum had MIC values ranging from 0.03 mg/l up to 128 mg/l when tested with this, least effective agent. Metronidazole was effective against all isolates except for a few strains of B. gracilis (MIC less than 4 mg/l). Tetracycline hydrochloride and minocycline were active against all isolates except for a few strains of B. gracilis (MIC less than 2 mg/l with both minocycline and tetracycline hydrochloride). Penicillin proved less effective than amoxycillin with regard to inhibition of B. gracilis.
