The effects of low doses of luminal ethanol on the amiloride-sensitive apical membrane potential of Necturus antral mucosa were studied using conventional microelectrode techniques. Luminal ethanol (0.250-4.0% vol/vol) caused a dose-dependent hyperpolarization of the apical membrane potential (Vmc), an increase in transepithelial resistance (Rt) and resistance ratio (Ra/Rb), and a decrease in transepithelial potential (Vms). Luminal amiloride (100 microM) to 4% ethanol-treated antra did not cause any additional hyperpolarization of Vmc. Compared with luminal 2% ethanol-Ringer, an equivalent osmotic mannitol solution depolarized Vmc and basolateral potential (Vcs), decreased Rt and Ra/Rb, and increased Vms. A single dose of 0.50% ethanol attenuated the effects of a second 2% ethanol exposure on Vmc. No change in periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive mucous granule content could be found between control and 2% ethanol-treated antra. The Ca2+ ionophores A23187 or ionomycin (0.25-5.0 microM) dose dependently hyperpolarized the Vmc and Vcs, increased Rt and Ra/Rb, and decreased Vms. Luminal Ca(2+)-free Ringer had no effect on luminal 2.00% ethanol-induced changes in membrane potentials or resistances. Pretreatment with BAPTA blocked by approximately 70 and 55% the Vmc hyperpolarization of 2 and 4% ethanol, respectively. Pretreatment with ruthenium red (10-50 microM) also dose dependently reduced the 2% ethanol-induced changes in Vmc. The data indicate that 1) low doses of luminal ethanol and Ca2+ ionophores have similar effects on Necturus gastric antral membrane potentials and resistances, 2) ethanol-induced hyperpolarizations of the Vmc are partially mediated through an alteration in intracellular Ca2+, and 3) low doses of luminal ethanol do not cause the release of antral epithelial mucous granules at the time when significant changes are occurring in the Vmc.
