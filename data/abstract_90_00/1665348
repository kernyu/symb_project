We have developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for detection of integrated retroviral transgenomes containing the neo G418 resistance gene in colonies (40 cells or more) grown in G418 selection after exposure to the neo-positive retrovirus LNL6. This assay also provides for simultaneous characterization of these colonies as belonging to a chronic myelogenous leukemic (bcr-abl positive) or nonleukemic population (bcr-abl negative). Using these techniques, we assessed transduction of the LNL6 retrovirus into the normal and leukemic cells of a blast-crisis chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patient. This work was designed to support the use of the LNL6 retroviral marker to help identify the origin of relapse after autologous marrow infusion. The data from these experiments show that the majority of CML blast crisis cells that, following exposure to the LNL6 virus, produce colonies under rigorous G418 selection are indeed transduced by the virus, as shown by the presence of the neo retroviral gene. Most of these colonies are also shown to be leukemic by PCR detection of the bcr-abl RNA. This demonstrates the feasibility of the study of CML marrow for retroviral marking. These procedures will be of use in establishing if relapse arises from leukemic blasts which contaminate purged autologous bone marrow infused following intensive therapy for leukemia.
