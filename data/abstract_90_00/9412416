The main pathogens of inflammatory diseases of the kidneys and upper urinary tracts in inpatients of an urological unit were gramnegative organisms of the family Enterobacteriaceae while the pathogens of the infection of the lower urinary tracts (nonspecific urethritis) and male genitalia were grampositive cocci. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter agglomerans and Proteus spp. (indole positive) were the chief causative agents of the hospital infections. The analysis of the materials revealed a tendency towards an increase in the microflora resistance to the most widely used antibiotics: aminoglycosides, cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. This especially applied to the "problem" pathogen P.aeruginosa. Thus, in 1987 the portion of the P.aeruginosa gentamicin susceptible strains amounted to 52 per cent whereas in 1996 it was 13 per cent. The strains susceptible to ofloxacin equaled 79 per cent in 1988 and 44 per cent in 1995. At present the drugs of choice in the treatment of urinary tract infections due to P.aeruginosa are ceftazidime, cefpirome and amikacin (65, 64 and 62 per cent of the susceptible strains respectively). The importance of permanent microbiological monitoring and the respective correction of the therapy are indicated.
