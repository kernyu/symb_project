Strains of Mycobacterium smegmatis, a mycobacterium which shares genetic sequences, grows more rapidly, and is nonpathogenic in man as compared with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, were utilized for the initial development of new antimycobacterial therapy. Drug-resistant strains of M. smegmatis which are known to arise in a manner identical to the emergence of drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis were isolated and utilized as models for the antimycobacterial activities of modified and unmodified oligodeoxynucleotide phosphorothioates in broth cultures. Under normal conditions, oligodeoxynucleotide phosphorothioates do not enter mycobacteria, and several strategies were successfully utilized to afford entry of oligonucleotides into the mycobacterial cells. One involved the presence of very low levels of ethambutol, which enables the entry of oligonucleotides into mycobacteria because of its induced alterations in the cell wall, and another involved the utilization of oligonucleotides covalently attached to a D-cycloserine molecule, whereby entry into the mycobacterial cell is achieved by a receptor-mediated process. Another low molecular weight, covalently attached ligand that enabled the entry and subsequent antimycobacterial activities of oligodeoxynucleotide phosphorothioates in the absence of a cell wall modifying reagent was biotin. Significant sequence-specific growth inhibition of wild-type, as well as of drug-resistant, M. smegmatis was obtained by modified oligonucleotides complementary in sequence to a specific region of the mycobacterium aspartokinase (ask) gene when utilized in combinations with ethambutol (as compared to ethambutol alone) or as D-cycloserine or biotin covalent adducts without the presence of any other cytotoxic or cytostatic agent.
