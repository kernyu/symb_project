Obligate anaerobic bacteria were cultured from 15 orofacial abscesses. Bacteroides species constituted 43 per cent, Clostridium 21 per cent, Fusobacterium 14 per cent, Peptostreptococci 11 per cent, peptococci 7 per cent and Veillonella 4 per cent of the isolates. This study confirms the polymicrobial nature of orofacial infections. Sensitivity to antibiotics was unpredictable. Clostridium difficile, Clostridium tetani, Peptostreptococcus productus and Veillonella parvula showed resistance to some of the most frequently used antibiotics. Ampicillin and tetracycline were the most effective antibiotics and the highest resistance was shown against erythromycin.
