Candida dubliniensis is a newly recognized fungal pathogen causing mucosal disease in AIDS patients. Although preliminary studies indicate that most strains of C. dubliniensis are susceptible to established antifungal agents, fluconazole-resistant strains have been detected. Furthermore, fluconazole-resistant strains are easily derived in vitro, and these strains exhibit increased expression of multidrug resistance transporters, especially MDR1. Because of the potential for the development of resistant strains of C. dubliniensis, it is prudent to explore the in vitro activities of several of the newer triazole and echinocandin antifungals against isolates of C. dubliniensis. In this study we tested 71 isolates of C. dubliniensis against the triazoles BMS-207147, Sch 56592, and voriconazole and a representative of the echinocandin class of antifungal agents, MK-0991. We compared the activities of these agents with those of the established antifungal agents fluconazole, itraconazole, amphotericin B, and 5-fluorocytosine (5FC) by using National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards microdilution reference methods. Our findings indicate that the vast majority of clinical isolates of C. dubliniensis are highly susceptible to both new and established antifungal agents. Strains with decreased susceptibilities to fluconazole remained susceptible to the investigational agents as well as to amphotericin B and 5FC. The increased potencies of the new triazole and echinocandin antifungal agents may provide effective therapeutic options for the treatment of infections due to C. dubliniensis.
