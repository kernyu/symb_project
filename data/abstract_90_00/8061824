In this paper we present a new HPLC method for the determination of novobiocin in human serum. The assay uses mitomycin C as an internal standard, protein precipitation with acetonitrile, an ODS reversed-phase column with an isocratic mobile phase of acetonitrile-0.01 M phosphoric acid (80:20, v/v), and UV detection at 340 nm. The assay has a lower limit of quantitation of 1 microgram/ml and is linear over the range of 1-1000 micrograms/ml. The assay is ideally suited for use in clinical trials as it requires minimal amounts of serum, is highly sensitive and reproducible, is performed with minimal sample preparation, and involves a short run time. It should prove important in evaluating the potential of novobiocin as a means to modulate resistance to antineoplastic chemotherapy and in therapeutic drug monitoring of the growing number of patients receiving novobiocin to control methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections.
