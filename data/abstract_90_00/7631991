INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of mucocutaneous herpetic infection is especially high in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In these patients, 8 p. 100 of the chronic or recurrent herpetic lesions are due to a mutant strain. CASE REPORT: A case of very large (900 cm2) genital chronic herpetic infection is reported in a patient with AIDS (stade C3-CDC/WHO 1993). It was characterised by an acyclovir resistant strain which emerged after several anterior treatment with acyclovir. A treatment with foscarnet was administered and clinical improvement was observed as early as the fourth day, with complete reepithelialization 50 days later. DISCUSSION: We discussed essentially the pathogenicity of the herpetic infections due to mutant strains in immunocompromised patients and on the therapeutic modalities. At the present time, foscarnet is the treatment of choice for acyclovir-resistant mucocutaneous herpes simplex.
