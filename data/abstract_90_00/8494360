Two patients (patients A and B) infected with Salmonella typhimurium failed ciprofloxacin therapy, and the posttherapy isolates had reduced susceptibilities to quinolones; 6 of 11 isolates from patient B were also cross-resistant to chemically unrelated agents. No transferable resistance, chloramphenicol-acetylating enzymes, or beta-lactamases were detected. For 13 of 14 isolates, the concentrations of ciprofloxacin that inhibited DNA synthesis by 50% were similar to the MICs, suggesting a mutation in gyrA. Insertion of pNJR3-2 (gyrA) in the posttherapy isolate from patient A and 5 of 11 of the posttherapy isolates from patient B resulted in lower quinolone MICs, also suggesting that resistance was due to a mutation in gyrA. Three of the five isolates also had reduced levels of accumulation of quinolones. All six cross-resistant isolates from patient B had reduced levels of accumulation of quinolones, but only one isolate had increased susceptibility when pNJR3-2 was inserted. Despite the lack of OmpF seen in five isolates from patient B, there was no correlation with decreased levels of quinolone accumulation. All isolates had identical smooth lipopolysaccharide profiles. The mechanism of apparently reduced accumulation has yet to be determined.
