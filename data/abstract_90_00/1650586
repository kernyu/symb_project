Retroviral vectors carrying the neomycin phosphotransferase (neo) gene have been shown to confer G418 resistance to canine keratinocytes at relatively high frequency. To investigate the usefulness of keratinocytes as potential target cells for gene therapy, we used a retroviral vector (LASN) that contains both human adenosine deaminase (hADA) and neo genes. We show here that LASN-transduced canine keratinocytes expressed high levels of hADA, a human protein of therapeutic relevance. Selection of LASN-transduced keratinocytes in medium containing G418 resulted in a population of cells that expressed even higher levels of hADA, about 80-fold higher than the endogenous canine ADA level. However, the G418-selected cells had a reduced proliferative potential and altered morphology indicative of terminal differentiation. To test whether L-histidinol is more beneficial for selection of keratinocytes than G418, we constructed two retroviral vectors that contain both the neo and the histidinol dehydrogenase (hisD) genes. Cocultivation of primary keratinocytes with lethally irradiated PA317 retrovirus packaging cells that produce these vectors gave rise to 12-53% drug-resistant colonies in either G418 or L-histidinol. In contrast to G418, selection of transduced keratinocytes in L-histidinol had no apparent effect on the proliferative potential or morphology of drug-resistant cells containing the vectors. Given the utility of this selection system, two hisD-based generic constructs containing cloning sites for cDNA expression from either the retroviral promoter or from an internal human cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter were constructed. Our results suggest that hisD will be a useful selectable marker for use in studies of keratinocyte differentiation and for transfer of genes into keratinocytes for the purposes of gene therapy.
