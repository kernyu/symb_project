Two 1.7 Md plasmids of Staphylococcus epidermidis and three ones of Staphylococcus simulans determining inducible macrolide-lincosamide resistance are identical as judged by restriction endonuclease fingerprinting. These plasmids designated pEI2101, pEI9105, pE1107, pEI1108 and pEI6104, respectively, belong to the incompatibility group 12. Dot-blot hybridization by photobiotin-labelled gene probe developed from S. aureus erythromycin ribosomal methylase gene showed cross hybridization between methylase-coding reference plasmids and the tested ones. The examined plasmids proved to be no transmissible in mating experiments into S. aureus recipients.
