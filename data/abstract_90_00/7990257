In order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of ciprofloxacin (CPFX), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of CPFX and other drugs were determined against clinical isolates that were obtained in our laboratory from January to December of 1991, and of 1993. The results are summarized as follows: 1. CPFX-resistant strains were on the increase in various strains, compared to those in the early 1980s. However, many of CPFX-resistant strains were multi-drug resistant including beta-lactams. In addition, they showed cross resistance to other fluoroquinolone agents. 2. MIC distribution of other drugs suggested that there were increased frequencies of benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP) and CEPs-resistant Escherichia coli. However, MIC distribution of CPFX to these resistant strains were in a relatively low range. 3. When isolates of 1991 were compared to those of 1993, we confirmed that CPFX-resistant strains decreased among certain bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus. Also we confirmed that fewer CPFX-resistant strains were found among bacteria that may be highly related to infections encountered in daily medical care.
