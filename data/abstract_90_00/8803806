Amphotericin B resistant mutants of Cryptococcus neoformans were isolated accumulating mainly ergosterol. Cross-resistance to azole antifungals was not observed. Together with previous data this indicates that at least three categories of amphotericin B resistance can arise: sterol mutants, amphotericin B and azole cross-resistant mutants and amphotericin B resistant mutants with no azole cross-resistance.
