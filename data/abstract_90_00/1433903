Antimicrobial activities were examined for major antibacterial agents against clinically isolated microbial strains which were isolated and identified from materials collected from inpatients with various infections in 1988, 1989 and 1990, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. Among strains isolated each year, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were found frequently. 2. CEPs-resistant Escherichia coli strains were observed among strains isolated each year. 3. Increasing tendencies in resistances of Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens to cephems and new quinolones were observed. 4. Increasing tendencies in resistances of Proteus vulgaris to ceftazidime (CAZ) and new quinolones appeared to exist. 5. Among strains isolated each year, resistances of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to CAZ and quinolones were observed in high rates, but also their resistances to imipenem appeared to increase. 6. Many of recently increasing multiple resistant bacteria seem to have different sites of drug action and/or to have non-hydrolytic modes of resistance.
