Control of viral replication by interferon (IFN) is thought to be principally mediated by the 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)/RNAse L, double-stranded dependent protein kinase (PKR), and myxovirus resistance protein (Mx) pathways. In this study, we monitored the constitutive and IFN-induced antiviral activity in mouse embryo fibroblasts lines derived from mice with targeted disruption of either PKR or PKR/RNAse L genes. At high multiplicity of infection (moi = 10), the absence of PKR had no effect on replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) but moderately enhanced encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) growth and greatly increased replication of herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1). Replication of EMCV, HSV-1, and VSV was modestly higher in PKR-/- RNAse L-/- fibroblasts when compared with control cells. Although the antiviral action of IFN-alpha was unaffected by the absence of PKR, IFN action was significantly impaired in the double knockout cells but was dependent on the stage of the virus cycle. At early stages, it appeared that anti-EMCV and anti-HSV-1 action of IFN-alpha was significantly compromised, although weak residual antiviral activity was seen. The action of IFN-alpha against VSV was specifically compromised at a late stage of virus replication. The results showed that PKR is an important mediator in constitutive resistance against HSV-1 and that RNAse L is also necessary for the full antiviral activity of IFN against a variety of viruses. These results supported the existence of novel pathways aimed toward specific stages of the virus life cycle.
