The good results achieved in the treatment of malaria with a 7 and 5 days one of quinine (orally dose 8 mg/kg/8 h), incited the authors to try a 3 days long treatment at the same dose. They experimented this protocol on hospitalised children. All patients were free of parasites at day 7 with an average residual concentration quinine of 2.7 +/- 0.8 mg/l. Among the 7 patients with malaria at day 14, 4 didn't require another treatment and 2 presented new infestation. 50% of plasmodial isolated strains were chloroquine resistant and 40% amodiaquine resistant. The efficiency of this protocol could be in favour of its larger use.
