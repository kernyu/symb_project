OBJECTIVES: Assess the efficacy of preventive and curative treatments of imported malaria. METHODS: The in vitro drug susceptibility of mefloquine, chloroquine and cycloguanil was determined against African isolates of Plasmodium falciparum from imported malaria cases by an isotopic in vitro test or a genomic approach. RESULTS: Plasmodium falciparum resistance to mefloquine, chloroquine or to the dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor was present in 5.2%, 46% and 42% of isolates respectively. Plasmodium falciparum drug resistance to chloroquine or antifolinics was more frequent in permanent than in seasonal malarial transmission areas. Simultaneous resistance to chloroquine and antifolinics was observed in 17% of isolates between 1991 and 1994 and in 28% between 1995 and 1997.
