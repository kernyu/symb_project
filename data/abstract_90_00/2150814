The interaction between imipenem and two glycopeptides against staphylococci was examined for potential synergy. Imipenem in combination with vancomycin or teicoplanin exerted a synergistic or additive effect against a majority of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates tested by the checkerboard method. Synergistic inhibitory effects were frequently accompanied by synergistic bactericidal effects. For a proportion of bacterial isolates of both species, the demonstration of synergy by the checkerboard method was confirmed by time-kill studies using antibiotic combinations at the MICs or at achievable serum antibiotic levels. Only with a single isolate of Staphylococcus epidermidis was antagonism with either antibiotic combination recorded.
