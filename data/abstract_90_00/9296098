We selected 20 clinical Enterococcus isolates in order to represent the different types of amoxicillin and/or gentamicin-resistance present in our hospital. Bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities of amoxicillin, pefloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, vancomycin, alone or associated with gentamicin, were evaluated on those 20 isolates. Sparfloxacin or ciprofloxacin were more frequently bacteriostatic and/or bactericidal than pefloxacin or ofloxacin. The effect of quinolones and gentamicin in combination use was not only synergistic but antagonistic, which is not in agreement with others' results.
