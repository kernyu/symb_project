This study investigated the differential hemodynamic effects of small to high doses of ethanol in conscious age-matched spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and Wistar Kyoto rats (WKYs). Changes evoked by ethanol (0.25, 0.5, or 1 g/kg, i.v.) or equal volume of saline in mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV), and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were followed for 90 min in the two rat strains. The baseline MAP (163 +/- 4 vs. 113 +/- 2 mm Hg) of SHRs was significantly (p < 0.05) higher, compared with WKYs due mainly to the presence of an elevated TPR 13.82 +/- 0.12 vs. 2.51 +/- 0.09 mm Hg/ml/min/100 g, p < 0.05) in SHRs. In both rat strains, all doses of ethanol produced immediate increases in MAP at 1 min, after which the MAP responses varied and depended on the rat strain and dose of ethanol used. In WKYs, 0.25 g/kg ethanol had no effect on MAP, but caused significant decreases in CO and SV and increased HR. Ethanol (0.5 and 1 g/kg) produced a short-lived (10 min) and dose-related increase in MAP. The higher dose (1 g/kg) of ethanol elicited significant (p < 0.05) increases in TPR that were counterbalanced by concomitant decreases in CO and SV. In SHRs, the two higher doses (0.5 and 1 g/kg) of ethanol elicited significant (p < 0.05) decreases and increases in MAP, respectively, compared with control (saline-treated) values. The pressor response to the 1 g/kg dose of ethanol was associated with an increase in TPR that achieved a statistical significance (p < 0.05) at 50 and 80 min after ethanol administration. HR was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced by the two higher doses of ethanol, whereas SV and CO were not changed. Blood ethanol concentrations measured 10, 30, and 60 min after ethanol administration were similar in SHRs and WKYs. These findings suggest that acute administration of ethanol to conscious rats elicits hemodynamic responses that are strain- and dose-dependent. In contrast to a short-lived and dose-related pressor response in WKYs, ethanol (0.5 and 1 g/kg) elicited opposite and longer lasting effects on MAP (decreases and increases, respectively) in SHRs. In both rat strains, the pressor response to the higher dose of ethanol was associated with an increase in TPR; an effect that was compromised by a concomitant decrease in CO in WKYs but not SHRs.
