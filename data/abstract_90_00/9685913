The effect of current, its magnitude and penetration enhancers (propylene glycol/oleic acid) on the transdermal flux of AZT (Zidovudine) across hairless mouse skin was studied and the results were compared. The in vitro iontophoretic flux from AZT solution increased to about 5-40 fold that obtained by passive diffusion, depending on the magnitude of current density. When the donor side was karaya gum matrix, instead of solution, the flux enhancement effect by iontophoresis was much smaller. Incorporation of penetration enhancers into the matrix increased the passive flux 2-50 fold, depending on the amount of penetration enhancers in the matrix. These enhancers worked synergistically with iontophoresis in the transdermal transport: a much larger flux than that expected from a simple additive effect was observed. Electrical resistance data from our previous work is utilized to further discuss this synergistic effect.
