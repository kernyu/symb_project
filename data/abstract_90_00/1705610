Comparative analysis of the results of studying M. tuberculosis drug resistance in the material from 223 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis by the bacteriologic method and of antibody production studied in 3 serologic tests (passive hemolysis, complement consumption, and indirect hemagglutination--PH, CC, and IHA, respectively) has shown the highest number of positive results in CC in the patients excreting streptomycin-resistant strains, whereas patients excreting isoniazid-resistant strains had the highest titers in IHA. The levels of complement-fixing and hemagglutinating antibodies accumulation depended on the type and degree of drug resistance and were not related to the form or phase of tuberculous process.
