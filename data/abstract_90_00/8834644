The aim of the paper was to compare the efficacy of two therapeutical protocols employed in children with steroidresistant nephrotic syndrome. Group 1 consisted of 10 children treated with methylprednisolone (Met P). In six of them morphologic studies revealed glomerulosclerosis, and in four--submicroscopic glomerulonephritis. Group 2 included 7 children treated with cyclosporin A (CsA). In six of them morphological studies showed glomerulosclerosis, and in one--mesangial glomerulonephritis. There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to age and biochemical parameters. In Group 1, improvement was achieved in six children (3 cases of glomerulosclerosis and 3 cases of submicroscopic glomerulonephritis), and partial improvement in two patients. Two cases of glomerulosclerosis yielded no improvement at all. In Group 2 improvement was seen in five children, partial improvement in one, and no improvement in another patient with mesangial glomerulonephritis. The efficacy of treatment employing Met P and CsA is comparable. No firm conclusions can be formulated due to a shorter time of CsA treatment. CsA seems to be justified in patients who showed no improvement following the MetP therapy.
