Nickel(II) is a human carcinogen causing respiratory cancers. The purpose of this study was to determine whether Ni(II) may induce microsatellite mutations in human cells. We transfected the three human lung tumor cell lines A427, HCC15 and NCI-H2009 with a mammalian expression vector containing a (CA)(13) repeat in the coding sequences of the reporter hygromycin gene (hyg). A total of 33 clones carrying the integrated vector derived from the three cell lines was investigated for spontaneous and Ni(II)-induced hygromycin-resistant (hyg(r)) reversion mutants. Significantly higher frequencies of hyg(r) reversion mutations were observed in Ni(II)-treated cells (NCI-H2009 and HCC-15) than control cells. In the majority of the colonies hyg(r) phenotype was due to mutations within the integrated (CA) repeat sequence. The type of mutations consisted of both contraction and expansion of the (CA) repeat unit. The finding that Ni(II) promotes microsatellite mutations raises the possibility that genetic instability may be a mechanism involved in nickel carcinogenesis.
