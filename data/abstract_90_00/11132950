In order to improve the antibacterial activity of cefozopran (CZOP) against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), we initiated chemical modification to introduce a 2-(5-amino-1,2,4-thiadiazol-3-yl)-2(Z)-hydroxyimino acetyl group at the C-7 position and a 3- or 6-substituted imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazinium or 5-substituted imidazo[1,2-a]pyridinium group at the C-3' position. Although this approach successfully enhanced the anti-MRSA activity of CZOP two to eight times, a slight decrease in the activity against Gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa was involved. Among the novel derivatives, 3-(6-aminoimidazo[1,2-b]pyridazinium-1-yl)methyl-7beta-[2-(5-amino-1,2,4-thiadiaz ol-3-yl)-2(Z)hydroxyiminoacetamido]-3-cephem-4-carboxylate (44a) showed an excellent balance of activity against MRSA and Gram-negative bacteria.
