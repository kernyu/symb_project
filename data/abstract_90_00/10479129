Many amino acid (aa) sites in reverse transcriptase (RT) have been implicated in resistance to nucleoside (NRTI) and nonnucleoside antiretrovirals. Interactions between these in response to combination therapy remain poorly understood. In a trial (ACTG 241) of zidovudine/didanosine (ddI) versus zidovudine/ddI/nevirapine in nucleoside-experienced patients, baseline sequence data from the RT coding region was analyzed from 55 individuals. Sequences were clustered by use of a parsimony method and the virological responses (ratio of baseline viral load to viral load after of therapy) for each cluster were analyzed at week 8 and week 48. Both clusters and genotype at aa 215 were significantly associated with virological response at both time points, whereas viral load showed a stronger association with sequence clusters. Sequence clusters identified one group of patients who never developed high-level resistance to NRTIs despite prior nucleoside exposure and poor suppression of viral replication.
