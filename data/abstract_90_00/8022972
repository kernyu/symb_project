Tuberculosis, an ancient disease undergoing recent control by public hygiene and drug therapy, has experienced a recrudescence in the United States. Factors leading to the increased incidence of tuberculosis include the high incidence of tuberculosis among the AIDS population, an increase in Asian immigrants, and the emergence of drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis. Radiographically, the picture also has changed with a much higher incidence of primary tuberculosis in the adult population.
