We studied the efficacy of continuous intravenous infusion of ampicillin compared with that of intermittent administration of ampicillin alone or in combination with gentamicin for the therapy of highly aminoglycoside-resistant enterococcal experimental endocarditis. Rabbits were infected with a gentamicin-susceptible (MIC, 256 micrograms/ml) strain of Enterococcus faecalis or a strain of E. faecalis which was highly resistant to gentamicin in vitro (MIC, greater than 2,000 micrograms/ml). Administration of ampicillin by continuous intravenous infusion did not significantly enhance the killing of enterococci in vivo compared with that by intermittent administration of ampicillin for either the aminoglycoside-susceptible or the aminoglycoside-resistant strain. In combination with gentamicin, there were no significant differences in efficacies obtained with intermittent versus continuous intravenous infusion of ampicillin therapy for experimental endocarditis caused by either strain of E. faecalis.
