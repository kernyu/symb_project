Vancomycin-resistant enterococci recently isolated from patient specimens were tested with both Streptex and PathoDx group D latex agglutination antisera. Using routine protocols, all isolates from patients at Temple University Hospital were positive with the PathoDx reagents and were negative with the Streptex reagents. Isolates required extensive boiling for positive reactions to occur using Streptex reagents.
