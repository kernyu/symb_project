Levels of cytokine mRNA were studied in the central nervous system (CNS) of SCID mice infected with Toxoplasma gondii. This infection led to 100% mortality by day 23 postinfection. Inflammation was observed in the lungs on day 7 and in the heart, liver, and kidneys on days 14 and 18 of infection. In the CNS, necrotic, acellular lesions that contained numerous parasites, accompanied by a localized astrocyte activation, were evident on day 14. Polymerase chain reaction-assisted amplification of RNA revealed that, although transcripts for interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) and IL-1 beta were present in the brains of uninfected mice, increased levels of these transcripts were detected on day 7 of infection. Transcripts for macrophage inflammatory protein 1 and transforming growth factor beta were also detected in brains of infected mice at this time point. On days 14 and 18, levels of these transcripts had increased and transcripts for IL-6, IL-10, gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were also detected. Transcripts for IL-2 or IL-4 were not detected at any of the time points. Detection of locally produced cytokine transcripts may reflect involvement of the cytokines in the immunopathogenesis of this infection or involvement in mediating antitoxoplasma activity. To assess the possible role of endogenous IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-10, IL-6, and GM-CSF, cytokine-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies were administered to infected SCID mice. Neutralization of IFN-gamma or TNF-alpha led to earlier mortality than that in controls. In contrast, treatment with antibody to IL-10 and IL-6 increased survival time. Treatment with anti-GM-CSF did not alter the time to death. These results indicate that TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma are both involved in T-cell-independent mechanisms of resistance to T. gondii in SCID mice and that IL-10 and IL-6 may downregulate the immune response to this pathogen.
