In a retrospective analysis, patients with bacteremia due to Enterococcus faecalis with and without high-level gentamicin resistance (GRE; MIC greater than 2000 micrograms/ml) were compared. Bacteremic patients with GRE (n = 32) had significantly higher rates of nosocomial acquisition and bladder catheterization, longer hospitalizations, and more frequent prior treatment with cephalosporins than did bacteremic patients without high-level resistance (n = 19). Overall mortality was significantly associated with septic shock, high-risk source (intraabdominal, wound, respiratory tract, multiple, unknown), and polymicrobial bacteremia. Higher mortality was observed in GRE bacteremia (47%) than in bacteremia without high-level resistance (37%), but this difference was not statistically significant. For patients with monomicrobial bacteremia, low-risk source (genitourinary tract, intravascular), or treatment with antibiotics appropriate for the enterococcus, higher mortality with GRE bacteremia approached statistical significance. These results suggest that high-level resistance adversely affects survival with a pure E. faecalis bacteremia or low-risk bacteremic source. Also, response to antibiotic therapy may be diminished by high-level resistance.
