Public health agencies across the country uniformly retain three core functions, as identified in a 1988 Institute of Medicine report: assessment, assurance, and planning and policy development. The conduct of these functions will influence the ways the Public Health Service recommendations for postexposure prophylaxis are implemented locally. State, territorial, and local health departments play a key role in the monitoring and prevention of occupationally acquired human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. Through assessment, public health agencies often are responsible for investigating healthcare workers who apparently have contracted HIV infection through an occupational exposure. In their function of providing assurance, public health agencies disseminate the national recommendations and may provide expert consultation taking into consideration local conditions. Specific healthcare worker exposure situations may pose complex medical and legal challenges best handled by public health agencies. In their role of providing policy development, public health agencies may convene an expert panel to review local data that affect postexposure prophylaxis, such as antiretroviral drug resistance and drug availability. The recommendations may result in legislative action in the form of mandatory testing of patients or other groups, and public health agencies must be wary of such attempts that are of unproven efficacy. Public health agencies nationwide must see that exposed healthcare workers and the clinicians counseling them are adequately informed about the risks of HIV transmission and the options available for prophylaxis.
