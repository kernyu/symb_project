Sixty-five isolates of Aeromonas salmonicida were assessed for antimicrobial sensitivity by disc diffusion tests and the results compared with the minimum inhibitory concentration for each isolate. The results demonstrated that disc diffusion, using a standard technique, may be used to categorize isolates as sensitive or resistant provided that the corresponding minimum inhibitory concentrations are known.
