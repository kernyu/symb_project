We sought to determine if commercially available susceptibility tests were accurate in detecting penicillin resistance and relative resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae. We compared the reference MIC method with oxacillin disk screening and three commercial tests, E-test (AB Biodisk), JustOne (Radiometer America), and MicroScan Pos MIC Panel Type 6 (Baxter Diagnostics), with 80 selected clinical isolates. Thirty-three additional isolates were tested by the reference method and the E-test to further validate the latter method. Oxacillin screening was effective in detecting all penicillin-resistant and relatively resistant strains of S. pneumoniae. The MicroScan method was not effective in detecting penicillin resistance or relative resistance. The JustOne system classified only 6 (35%) of 17 resistant strains correctly, with 11 resistant strains classified as relatively resistant. The E-test correctly classified 30 (83%) of 36 resistant isolates, with 6 resistant isolates interpreted as relatively resistant. For determining penicillin MICs for S. pneumoniae, the E-test was the most accurate of the commercial systems that we studied.
