From 1973 to 1995, 29 new and reemerging pathogenic microbes were recognized. However, in discussions about emerging infectious diseases, the focus is often on the clinical effects of the host-parasite relationship, rather than the examination of the biology of the pathogen. Many of what we refer to as emerging diseases are characterized better as 'diseases of human progress'. Thus, the aerosolization of water has played an important role in the emergence of Legionella pneumophila infections. New diseases are superimposed on endemic diseases such as diarrhoeal diseases, malaria and tuberculosis. In addition, many pathogens are becoming increasingly resistant to standard antimicrobial drugs, making treatment difficult and in some cases impossible. We summarize our experience on emerging parasitic diseases (primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, respiratory cryptosporidiosis, and diplogonoporiasis), and selected problems of bacterial resistance (MDR tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium bovis and macrolide-resistance mechanisms of Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. pyogenes).
