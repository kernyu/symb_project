The major components of the 2-5A system, responsible for the mammalian interferon-induced antiviral response, are the 2',5' oligoadenylate synthetase (2-5Aase) and 2',5' oligoadenylate (2-5A) dependent ribonuclease (RNase L). Transgenic tobacco plants expressing these two enzyme activities were produced by crossing the transgenic plants expressing RNase L with those expressing 2-5Aase. The double transgenic plants showed complete resistance against cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), infection with necrotic spots only forming on the virus-inoculated leaf. On the other hand, although plants inoculated with potato virus Y (PVY) formed necrotic spots on the inoculated leaf and virus amplification could not be detected, all plants died within 20 days of inoculation. The transgenic tobacco plants expressing either 2-5Aase or RNase L activity showed typical disease symptoms with CMV- or PVY-inoculation. These results suggest that the introduced 2-5A system is activated in tobacco cells by dsRNA, the replicating intermediates of RNA viruses, leading to death of the host cells, which has not been observed in mammalian cells.
