The global resurgence of tuberculosis and rampant drug resistance have rekindled the need for and interest in the development of new antitubercular drugs. Delineation of the possible drug targets furnished by the various mycobacterial cell components might result in rational approaches to the development of such agents. In the future, molecular genetics might help both in the bioengineering and rapid screening of the activity of new compound. Collaboration is anticipated between the pharmaceutical industry and academic institutions in these areas.
