MICs of piperacillin, sulbactam/cefoperazone, minocycline (MINO), gentamicin, amikacin, flomoxef, ceftazidime, cefozopran, cefsulodin and imipenem were determined, against 189 clinical isolated strains of glucose non-fermentative Gram-negative Rods (NFGNR; Acinetobacter baumannii (44), Alcaligenes faecalis (5), Alcaligenes xylosoxidans (25), Burkholderia cepacia (12), Chryseobacterium indologenes (23), Chryseobacterium meningosepticum (9), Pseudomonas fluorescens (8), Pseudomonas putida (12), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (51). Most species of these NFGNR show resistance to many antibiotics tested. Among the antibiotics used in this study, the only antibiotic effective against all species of NFGNR tested is MINO. The spectrums of antibacterial activities of various antibiotics determined by MICs may be useful in preliminary test for identification of these NFGNR.
