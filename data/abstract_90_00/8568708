Blood culture reports were studied in 1266 cases of clinically suspected neonatal septicemia, to determine the bacteriological profile and antibiotic sensitivity pattern of the cultured isolates. Blood culture was positive in 24.88% of cases. Gram negative septicemia was encountered in 87.1% of these neonates. Klebsiella and Enterobacter species were the predominant pathogens amongst Gram negative organisms. Of Gram positive isolates, Staphylococcus aureus was the predominant isolate (79.0%). Salmonella species was isolated in 2.4% of these cases.
