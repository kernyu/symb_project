Heterophils are the predominate granulated leukocyte in the acute inflammatory response in gallinaceous birds. Heterophils are highly phagocytic and are capable of a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. They accumulate in inflamed tissue, causing tissue damage and forming heterophil granulomas that are morphologically similar to inflammatory lesions in reptiles. The avian heterophil lacks myeloperoxidase and depends primarily on nonoxidative mechanisms for antimicrobial activity. The beta-defensins found in heterophil granules can kill a wide variety of bacterial pathogens and are a major component of the heterophil antimicrobial arsenal. Heterophils form the first line of cellular defense against invading microbial pathogens in the lungs and air sacs where resident macrophages are lacking.
