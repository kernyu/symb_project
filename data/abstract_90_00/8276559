The drug resistance of 202 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infection (UTI) at urinary colony counts of 10(5) or more between 1989 and 1991 was studied. Of the 202 strains, 185 were submitted from UTI patients with underlying urinary disorders (complicated UTI patients) and became rapidly resistant to the majority of drugs tested. In addition, the incidence of methicillin-resistant or multiple drug resistant CNS tended to increase. These resistant strains were significantly more frequently isolated in patients with fever, which was strongly suspected to be due to CNS UTI. These results suggest that the prevalence of drug resistance in CNS from the urinary tract rapidly increases and drug-resistant CNS aggravate CNS UTI.
