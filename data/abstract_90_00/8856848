The purpose of the present study was to determine whether heat shock pretreatment would protect pulmonary endothelial cells and alveolar macrophages against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced injury. The bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (BPAECs) heat-shocked (42 degrees C for 2 h) prior to exposure to H2O2 (1 mmol/L for 45 min) showed significant decrease in H2O2-mediated increment of release of lactate dehydrogenase and production of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, and obvious alleviation in H2O2-induced decrease in activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase. Heat-shocked (42 degrees C for 2 h) rat pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) also obtained acquired resistance to injury by subsequent exposure of 1, 2, or 3 mmol/L H2O2 for 45 min. Simultaneously with this acquired oxidative resistance, Northern blot analysis showed that heat-shocked BPAECs and PAMs, contained an increased level of mRNA coding for the inducible form of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), and Western blot analysis indicated that there were increased expression of HSP70. Inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide (25 micrograms/mL) and inhibition of RNA synthesis by actinomycin D (5 micrograms/mL) prevented the cytoprotection against H2O2. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that heat shock pretreatment would protect pulmonary endothelial cells and alveolar macrophages against H2O2-induced injury, and possibly that HSPs play a role in this cytoprotection.
