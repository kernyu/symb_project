Intravenous injections of big endothelin (ET)-1 (700 pmol/kg) in the pig increased arterial plasma levels of ET-1-like immunoreactivity (ET-1-LI) from 11.1 +/- 0.7 pM to 46.3 +/- 6.7 pM in the control situation and from 11.5 +/- 0.4 pM to 58.2 +/- 17 pM in the presence of the neutral endopeptidase inhibitor phosphoramidon (3 mg/kg). Big ET-1 increased splenic vascular resistance by 29% in the control situation. The vasoconstriction evoked by big ET-1 in the spleen was reduced after phosphoramidon treatment whereas the elevation of arterial ET-1-LI was not influenced. Furthermore the splenic vasoconstriction evoked by ET-1 was reduced after phosphoramidon without influencing plasma ET-1-LI. Also in rats the pressor effect of big ET-1 (1 nmol/kg) was inhibited by phosphoramidon (5 mg/kg) whereas the elevation of plasma ET-1 was not influenced. It is concluded that the vasoconstrictor effects of both big ET-1 and ET-1 are inhibited, but the increase in plasma ET-1 is unaffected by phosphoramidon.
