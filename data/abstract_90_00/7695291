An uncommon dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), type IIIc, was coded for by Shigella sonnei that harbors plasmid pBH700 and that was isolated in North Carolina. The trimethoprim resistance gene carried on pBH700 was subcloned and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding type IIIc DHFR was identical to the gene encoding type VIII DHFR. The type IIIc amino acid sequence was approximately 50% similar to those of DHFRs commonly found in enteric bacteria. Furthermore, this gene was flanked by IS176 (IS26), an insertion sequence usually associated with those of aminoglycoside resistance genes. The gene for type IIIc DHFR was located by hybridization within a 1,993-bp PstI fragment in each of eight conjugative plasmids from geographically diverse strains of S. sonnei. Each plasmid also conferred resistance to ampicillin, streptomycin, and sulfamethoxazole and belonged to incompatibility group M. Plasmids carrying this new trimethoprim resistance gene, which is uniquely associated with IS176, have disseminated throughout the United States.
