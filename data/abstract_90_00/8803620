Septic shock is a common life-threatening problem, usually presenting with fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and often a source of infection. The cardiac index is increased, with a decreased systemic vascular resistance, and a reversibly decreased ejection fraction with an increased end diastolic volume. The myocardial depression is most likely caused by a circulating humoral substance that depresses myocardial contractility. The initial treatment of septic shock is aggressive fluid resuscitation and antibiotic therapy, with vasopressors and inotropes being indicated in those patients who do not respond adequately to fluids. Therapy directed against the mediators of septic shock is theoretically promising, but to date has not been successful.
