BACKGROUND: Obstetric and gynecologic complications associated with bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis have heightened awareness of these conditions, and thus metronidazole's role in obstetric and gynecologic practice continues to increase. GOAL OF THIS STUDY: To review the clinical indications for metronidazole in the obstetric and gynecologic setting, as well as the pharmacokinetics and potential adverse effects of the drug. STUDY DESIGN: Review of the current literature concerning metronidazole. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Metronidazole remains a valuable agent for the treatment of anaerobic and protozoal infections with little evidence of resistance. Although issues of mutagenicity and carcinogenicity remain theoretical concerns, current data do not support the existence of these risks in humans.
