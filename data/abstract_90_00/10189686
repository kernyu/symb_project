One of the most important factors, inhibiting the success of antiretroviral treatment of HIV infections is the development of drug resistant HIV strains in the patients during therapy. Detection and identification of such resistant virus strains is therefore becoming increasingly important for the clinical management of the patients, as well as for the detection of the transmission of already resistant virus strains. In the following paper different methods for the genotypic and phenotypic screening for resistant HIV-strains are compared and the problems of resistance testing are discussed.
