The authors reviewed the evolution of Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance in greater Abidjan for the year 1990. They used the classical course of treatment consisting of 25 mg per kg of bodyweight distributed on three days. Parasitaemia and body temperature controls were carried out on day O, day 2 and day 7. The study, which involved 547 children averaging 38.3 months of age disclosed an early in vivo resistance in the range of 18.20% as against 29.6% in 1988.
