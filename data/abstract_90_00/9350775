Susceptibility of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to gentamicin, the primary treatment for gonorrhea in Malawi since 1993, was determined by using agar dilution MICs, E-test MICs, disc diffusion, and clinical cure rate. Agar dilution MICs were slightly higher in 1996 than in 1993 isolates, with a concomitant drop in the clinical cure rate. E-test MICs were substantially lower than agar dilution determinations, with only 77.4% within 1 log2 concentration.
