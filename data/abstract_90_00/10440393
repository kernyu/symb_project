BACKGROUND: Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is known to be associated with a high recurrence rate and poor prognosis. Lamivudine, a nucleoside analogue, is a potent inhibitor of HBV replication, but it is associated with a 14-39% rate of resistance. METHODS: We report on four patients who underwent OLT for HBV infection. In all cases, the HBV infection recurred in the grafted liver and was treated with lamivudine (100 mg daily) on a compassionate-use basis. The patients were monitored closely for serum liver enzymes, hepatitis B surface antigen and HBV DNA (by hybridization). Liver biopsy was performed before and after lamivudine therapy. HBV DNA was amplified from serum for each patient and sequenced through a conserved polymerase domain, the tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate (YMDD) locus. RESULTS: All four patients exhibited lamivudine resistance 9-20 months after initiation of the drug. In all patients with a clinically mild disease, liver histology findings (12-24 months after lamivudine therapy) showed progressive fibrosis as compared to biopsies performed before lamivudine therapy, with a significant increase (> or =2 points) in the Knodell score in three patients. Moreover, two patients exhibited worsening of the necroinflammatory process. A mutation at the YMDD motif of the HBV polymerase gene was detected in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: Lamivudine resistance frequently occurs in patients with recurrent HBV infection after OLT and is associated with advanced hepatic fibrosis and necroinflammatory process. A combination of antiviral therapies may be necessary.
