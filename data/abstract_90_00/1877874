Aminoglycoside resistance patterns of 56 strains isolated from man, cattle and environment were determined. 34 out of 42 gentamicin-resistant strains were shown to produce AAC(3)-II and 7 strains produced ANT(2"). All the 48 kanamycin resistant strains produced APH(3')-I. Spot hybridization of the 42 gentamicin resistant strains with the inner fragment of the aacC2 gene revealed positive signals for all the strains. Hybridization of the 48 kanamycin-resistant strains with the aphA1 gene probe provided positive results in all the strains. The AAC(3)-IV encoding gene was not detected by DNA-DNA hybridization in the strains studied.
