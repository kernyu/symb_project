The results of a one-year clinical, epidemiological and microbiological survey of gonococcal infection presenting to the Patrick Clements Clinic (PCC), a London district general hospital (DGH) genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic, are presented. Clinical and epidemiological patient data were collected by a combination of questionnaire and retrospective case-note review. Microscopy performance within the PCC, outcome of treatment, return for tests of cure and efficacy of contact tracing were assessed. Isolates were tested for susceptibility to penicillin, tetracycline and ciprofloxacin. The study showed the PCC continues to diagnose and treat over 200 cases of gonorrhoea per year. High level resistance to penicillin, tetracycline and ciprofloxacin was documented among the year's isolates and antibiotic resistance was linked to acquisition of gonorrhoea overseas. Despite interviewing 183 patients concerning health advice and contact tracing issues, only 55% of new episodes re-attended for a first test of cure. In addition, only 29% of reported sexual contacts attended GUM clinics for investigation and treatment.
