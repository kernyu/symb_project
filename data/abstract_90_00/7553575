Human protozoal infections are ubiquitous and occur worldwide. In many cases, antiprotozoal agents currently in use predate the modern antibiotic era. Despite the relative lag in development of new antiprotozoal agents, the 1990s have witnessed an increasing level of interest in these infections, inspired by international travel and immigration, a growing awareness of antiprotozoal drug resistance, and the significance of acute and recrudescent protozoal infections in immunosuppressed hosts. This review summarizes for nonclinician readers the past, present, and future therapies for common human protozoal infections, as well as pharmacologic mechanisms of action and resistance and common toxicities associated with these agents.
