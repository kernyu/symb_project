Cibacron blue F3GA (CB) was found to reduce the MIC of oxacillin for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). This effect was not observed with methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. CB alters the resistance level of MRSA through a factor(s) other than mecA-related products, major autolysins, or femAB products. The exact target(s) of CB in causing the effect is unknown.
