In 1991, a multidrug-resistant strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was isolated from eight people with tuberculosis at a state correctional facility in New York. This strain, which is designated strain W (IS6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism type 212072), was resistant to isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, streptomycin, kanamycin, ethionamide, and rifabutin. Since that outbreak, the W strain has been associated with outbreaks in five hospitals in the New York City area and is a continuing public health problem in the area. To be able to identify this strain rapidly, we developed a multiplex PCR assay which targets a direct repeat of IS6110 with a 556-bp intervening sequence (NTF-1). The amplification generates two amplicons from strain W, which indicate the presence and orientation of the NTF-1 sequence between the direct repeat of IS6110, and a third amplicon, which serves as an internal PCR control. The assay was evaluated with 193 isolates of M. tuberculosis, and all 48 strain W isolates among those 193 isolates were correctly identified.
