Since 1988, we have isolated HIV-1 from 614 HIV-1-infected persons (total sample=2,785) in Japan. During the past 12 years, we have found a decline in the HIV-1 isolation rate in Japan, with two identifiable turning points, 1991-1992 and 1996-1997. The two turning points correspond to shifts in anti-HIV-1 therapy. These findings suggest that HIV-1 in Japan is currently biologically well controlled, probably due to anti-HIV-1 therapy. On the other hand, this decline is inconsistent with the recent increase of genetic drug-resistant HIV-1 in Japan. Further studies are needed to clarify mechanisms that might explain the discrepancy.
