A transformation system employing selectable resistance to hygromycin B has been developed for the mushroom-forming fungus, Pleurotus ostreatus. Vector pAN7-1, a commonly used non-replicative vector for integrative transformation in fungi, yielded 5-46 resistant colonies per micrograms of DNA per 10(7) viable protoplasts. Southern blot analysis of certain transformants revealed unexpected replicative plasmids containing pAN7-1 sequences, but modified for size, methylation and restriction enzyme pattern when compared to the initial transforming vector. Two such replicative derivatives of pAN7-1 have been rescued from P. ostreatus by cloning into Escherichia coli. Rescued plasmids have been used to probe DNA from untransformed P. ostreatus in an effort to identify fungal sequences that recombined in vivo with pAN7-1 to form replicative plasmids. Such replicative sequences have been localized in high molecular weight (chromosomal) DNA of wild-type P. ostreatus. Transformation has been obtained for P. ostreatus using a rescued plasmid, thereby confirming the role of this recombinant plasmid as a shuttle vector.
