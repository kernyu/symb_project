The resistance of bacteria, fungi and viruses to antimicrobials is increasing rapidly, with deleterious consequences. Dentistry's role in this development is unclear, because the necessary information has not yet been collected. Nevertheless, dentists should recognize that it is essential to use antimicrobials in an appropriate and responsible manner, both to treat infection effectively, and to minimize the likelihood that the bacteria in the general population will develop resistance to antimicrobials. The purpose of this article is to make dentists aware of the concerns raised by antimicrobial resistance, and how it can be avoided.
