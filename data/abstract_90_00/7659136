We report on three siblings, children of a farmer, aged 3-8 years, suffering from tinea capitis due to Microsporum canis. Initially, the infection was treated systemically with griseofulvin as well as externally for 5 months without success. Therapy was changed to itraconazole 33 mg per day orally. Laboratory investigations followed every 4-6 weeks. Dependent on the dose per kg body weight the children were cured clinically after 2-5 months and microbiologically after 5-8 months. Thus, itraconazole seems to be superior to conventional treatment with Microsporum canis-induced tinea capitis.
