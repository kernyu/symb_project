AIM: A 54-kDa protein overexpressed by chloroquine-resistant (CR) Plasmodium berghei ANKA strain was first reported by us. This study is conducted to detect the protein in pyronaridine-resistant (PR) P berghei ANKA strain. METHODS: Immunoblotting analysis and immunoelectron microscopy were used. RESULTS: PR parasites, like CR parasites, mainly overexpressed 2 major bands of 37 (36-38) kDa and 16 (15-17) kDa which were considered to be 2 subunits of 54 (52-62) kDa protein. Three of 7 times of experiments showed a 54-kDa and a 96 (95-100) kDa bands. The proteins were localized to be mainly scattered in cytoplasm of trophozoites, schizonts, and merozoites of erythrocytic stage of P berghei. Some of them were distributed in cytoplasm of erythrocytes infected with parasites. CONCLUSION: Both PR and CR parasites overexpressed the same proteins.
