Multiply-resistant Acinetobacter has emerged as an important organism in the Burns Unit of the Singapore General Hospital. From November 1990 onwards, a strain that was resistant to all antibiotics except Polymyxin B emerged in the Burns Unit. We present two cases where the Acinetobacter isolated was resistant to all antibiotics including Polymyxin B. These cases serve as an important reminder to adhere to strict infection control procedures.
