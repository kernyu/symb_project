The Vibrio cholerae strain of biotype El Tor and serotype Ol Ogawa was isolated from a 45-year old man after his return from India, hospitalized in Glogow (WSSE Legnica) with symptoms of food poisoning and considerable dehydration. From culture on alkaline agar, the Vibrio cholerae strain was isolated and manifested typical biochemical and serological properties except for resistance to the vibriostatic factor 0/129 (2,4-diamino-6,7-diisopropyl-pteridine). In addition, the strain was resistant to sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, cotrimoxazole and colistine, and susceptible to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, furazolidone and nalidixic acid. In Poland this is the first case isolation of Vibrio cholerae resistant to the vibriostatic factor. Most striking is the fact that Vibrio cholerae resistant to 0/129 is spreading geographically and it isolation is more and more frequent.
