BACKGROUND: The incidence of cutaneous bacterial infection after carbon dioxide (CO2 laser resurfacing is increasing. Patients with staphylococcal colonization of their anterior nares may be at greater risk for postoperative cutaneous colonization and/or infection, which can potentially cause scarring. OBJECTIVE: We present a case report of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus secondary infection of the skin after CO2 laser resurfacing. We discuss the possible etiologies of this patient's infection, her postoperative management, and preoperative suggestions for possibly preventing infection. METHODS: A 49-year-old woman was treated with CO2 laser resurfacing for moderate actinic damage and facial rhytides. She developed a cutaneous infection with methicillin-resistant S. aureus, which caused diffuse linear scarring on her cheeks and upper lip. RESULTS: The patient was successfully treated with oral minocycline, rifampin, and topical mupiricin ointment to her cutaneous erosions. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that it would be helpful for patients undergoing CO2 laser resurfacing to have their nares cultured to see if they are staphylococcal carriers. If a patient is found to be a carrier, mupiricin ointment can be used preoperatively treat to the nares, to help decrease the risk of infection of the skin from this potential source.
