The E test is a quantitative technique for determining antimicrobial susceptibility; it is based on the diffusion of a stable predetermined gradient of a specific antifungal agent along an inert plastic strip which is applied to a solid culture medium. The E test is an alternative method for determining inhibitory concentrations of antimicrobial agents. The aim of the present study was to determine the in vitro susceptibility of different yeasts to 5 antifungal agents using the E test. The antifungal susceptibility of 87 strains, 73 of which were yeasts obtained from clinical samples, 11 were Prototheca strains and 3 controls, were examined using a gradient diffusion technique (E test). Of these isolates, 13% of Candida albicans were resistant to flucytosine, and 20%, 17% and 33% showed resistance to ketoconazole, itraconazole and fluconazole, respectively. All Candida krusei isolates showed resistance to flucytosine and fluconazole. The Candida parapsilosis and Candida tropicalis strains all presented in vitro susceptibility to all the agents tested. Prototheca strains were only susceptible in vitro to amphotericin B. It was found that the E test was easy to perform, and provided MIC values similar to those obtained with other well documented techniques. It was therefore concluded that the E test could be implemented as a standard procedure in clinical mycology laboratories.
