Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates that were collected from 44 consecutive patients during 1 year in a community hospital were tested for susceptibility to five commonly used topical antibacterial agents. Agar-well susceptibility testing, which was based on zones of inhibition, was used to compare the effectiveness of the antibacterials against MRSA. Nitrofurazone was effective in inhibition of bacterial growth and was relatively inexpensive. Mupirocin was found to be effective but more costly for treatment of MRSA. Varying degrees of susceptibility to silver sulfadiazine, mafenide acetate, and bacitracin were noted in the cultures that were obtained at this medical center. On the basis of our findings from susceptibility tests compared with those of another center, we recommend that all hospitals undertake topical sensitivity testing of their MRSA isolates. Appropriate and effective topical antibacterial therapy can then be planned within each center.
