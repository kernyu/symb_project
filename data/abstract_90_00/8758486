During 2 months (01.01.95-28.02.95), we noted for each Staphylococcus aureus (SA) isolates, identification and susceptibility methods, hospital size, medical speciality, source, penicillin (P) and methicillin (M) susceptibility. For each non repetitive methicillin resistant SA we noted phenotype of aminoglycoside resistance of SA to 6 antistaphylococci drugs. We isolated 399 SA, SAP sensitives 6.5%, methicillin resistant SA (MRSA) 31.8%. MRSA in acute care unit 28.4%, non acute care unit 61.7%, surgery 28.6%, medicine 36.5%, orthopedics 34.5%, pediatrics 4%, ICU 38.8%, others 10.3%. MRSA from wound 28.2%, respiratory tract 38.3% blood 22.5%, urine 58.5%, others 25.8% - MRSA kanamycin 1.7%, kanamycin tobramycin 36.2%, kanamycin, tobramycin, gentamicin 56.9% - MRSA erythromycin 79.5%, pefloxacin 91.3%, rifampicin 53.5%, acide fusidique 8.7%, fosfomycine 18.9%, TMP SMZ 5.5%. The proportion MRSA is equivalent among medical specialities predominant in urine cultures and respiratory tract. It should be better to carry on the survey for more than two months in each hospital.
