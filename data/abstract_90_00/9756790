A single point mutation in the 23S rRNA gene of Helicobacter pylori is known to confer resistance to clarithromycin. Most prevalent among clarithromycin-resistant clinical H. pylori isolates are the mutations from A-2142 to G and A-2143 to G in the 23S rRNA gene. The bias in the 23S rRNA gene mutations conferring clarithromycin resistance may result from the higher MIC, stability of resistance, and growth rate found for the strains with the above-mentioned mutations.
