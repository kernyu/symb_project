Fluconazole inhibition of Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288c growth was evaluated in media containing ammonia, L-proline or L-leucine as a nitrogen source. Growth inhibition by fluconazole was maximum when L-proline was used as a nitrogen source, while rhodamine 6G accumulation and fluconazole resistance were the highest when ammonia was the sole nitrogen source.
