The clinical efficacy was evaluated on 1% silver sulfadiazine (AgSD) cream (Geben cream) for the treatment of ulcerative skin lesions infected with MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). 1% AgSD cream was applied once a day to cutaneous ulcers such as burns or decubitus or various other ulcers, infected with MRSA, in 13 patients. MRSA was eradicated in 45.5% of 11 evaluable patients. The clinical efficacy rate of 1% AgSD cream was 72.7% in this series of treatment. No side effects were noted in any of the patients, either locally or systemically. The results of the present study have indicated that 1% AgSD cream is useful for cutaneous ulcers such as burns or decubitus, infected with MRSA.
