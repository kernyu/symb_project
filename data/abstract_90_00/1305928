Methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) constitute a serious diagnostic and therapeutic problem. Over 500 strains of Staphylococcus aureus were tested for susceptibility to methicillin. By application of a screening method, 13.7% of these strains were classified as methicillin-resistant. Over 95% of these strains were isolated from hospital infections. Applying criteria of belonging of these strains to methicillin-resistance classes it was found that 49.3% belonged to class II, 31.2% to class III and 19.5% to class IV. Analysis of susceptibility to antibiotics of MRSA strains demonstrated significant differences between class II and between class III and IV in resistance to imipenem, gentamycin, erythromycin and tetracycline. All tested strains were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, vancomycin and teicoplanin. The screening method (25 mg methicillin/l of TSA medium) results in obtaining of univocal results of determination of methicillin-resistance in S. aureus.
