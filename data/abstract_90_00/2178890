A multicenter study aimed at assessing the in vitro activity of sulbactam/ampicillin against a wide range of bacterial pathogens was performed using 2,209 clinical strains, all recently collected from inpatients in seven Italian centers and preliminarily screened as being ampicillin-resistant and beta-lactamase producers. In comparative disk diffusion trials using 8 large-spectrum antimicrobials, the percentage of resistance to sulbactam/ampicillin in staphylococci was similar to the percentage of resistance to netilmicin and lower than to the other antibiotics; with gram-negative bacteria, only netilmicin, ofloxacin, and, less consistently, cefotetan showed lower incidences of resistance. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ampicillin alone and sulbactam/ampicillin together were determined using the agar dilution method. The Enterobacteriaceae strains which shifted to ampicillin susceptibility in the presence of sulbactam averaged 68%, but values significantly above or below average were observed in some genera of this family. The percentage of strains which the presence of sulbactam rendered ampicillin-susceptible in vitro reached 97% in Haemophilus strains and 100% in branhamellae and gonococci. High percentages were also recorded in staphylococci, with a peak of 100% in oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus strains. In general, center-to-center differences were relatively limited.
