Multiresistant tuberculoses are on the increase. The conversion rates in "additional" therapy are only modest. 17 multiresistant patients and 6 treatment-refractory tuberculoses were treated by us with ofloxacin-cycloserin-protionamide-INH. 16 of these patients were HIV positive. 21 patients converted after 3 months of treatment by the latest. 3 patients died of HIV syndrome. There was otherwise no difference between HIV positive and HIV negative patients. As a rule, the combination was well tolerated. In multiresistant tuberculosis, it is mandatory to administer at least 3 drugs to which there is no resistance.
