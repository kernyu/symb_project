Clinical isolates of different Enterobacteriaceae strains and genetically modified variants which were resistant to the disinfectant formaldehyde were investigated. In cell-free extracts of all formaldehyde-resistant strains a glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase activity was demonstrated. In contrast cell extracts from formaldehyde sensitive strains did not show any formaldehyde dehydrogenase activity. The enzymatic degradation of formaldehyde seems to play an important role in formaldehyde resistance.
