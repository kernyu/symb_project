An epidemiological survey of 703 bacterial strains isolated in Pordenone was performed in the first eight months of 1998, to verify the predominant bacterial incidence, the susceptibility to antimicrobial drugs in this period, and variations in the resistance patterns. The study demonstrated some interesting variations in this period: for example, there is a considerable increase in antimicrobial resistance of Escherichia coli (especially to cotrimoxazole, ampicillin, piperacillin and ciprofloxacin) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (to aztreonam and ciprofloxacin). The results suggest the importance of constant epidemiological surveillance in the hospital and community setting.
