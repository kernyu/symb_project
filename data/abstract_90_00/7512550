One of the pleiotropic phenotypes of mutations affecting DNA gyrase activity in Salmonella typhimurium is the constitutive deattenuation of the histidine operon. In the present work, we isolated and characterized a suppressor mutation which restores his attenuation in the presence of a defective gyrase. Such a suppressor, initially named sgdA1 (for suppressor gyrase deficiency), was found to correct additional phenotypes associated with defective gyrase function. These include the aberrant nucleoid partitioning of a gyrB mutant and the conditional lethality of a gyrA mutation. Furthermore, the sgdA1 mutation was found to confer low-level resistance to nalidixic acid. The last phenotype permitted isolation of a number of additional sgdA mutants. Genetic analysis established the recessive character of these alleles as well as the position of the sgdA locus at 57 U on the Salmonella genetic map. All of the sgdA mutants result from the same molecular event: a deletion removing three of the four tandemly repeated copies of argV, the gene which specifies tRNA(2Arg), the major arginine isoacceptor tRNA. These findings, combined with the observation of some Sgd-like phenotypes in a tRNA modification mutant (hisT mutant), lead us to propose that protein synthesis contributes, directly or indirectly, to the pathology of gyrase alterations in growing bacteria. We discuss plausible mechanisms which may be responsible for these effects.
