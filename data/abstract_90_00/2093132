Three hundred and forty-nine methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates from veterans were tested (by disc agar diffusion) for their in vitro activity against 18 antimicrobial agents. At least 90% of the isolates were susceptible to bacitracin, nitrofurantoin, hydrogen peroxide, novobiocin, netilmicin and vancomycin. We feel that the aminoglycoside, netilmicin, might provide an alternative agent (to intravenously administered vancomycin) for treating multiply-antimicrobial resistant MRSA. In addition, hydrogen peroxide exhibited very good activity against the test isolates and may have some use as a topical agent for reduction of MRSA on skin and some mucous membranes. This study suggests that further evaluation of netilmicin and hydrogen peroxide (topical only) might be useful.
