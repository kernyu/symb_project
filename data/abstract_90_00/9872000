Among recent clinical isolates in Japan, strain CU264 was discovered which formed unusual colonies. This strain was identified as Rahnella aquatilis which is usually found in water. The antibiotic susceptibilities against tetracycline, carbenicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, sulphonamide, neomycin, fosfomycin, rifampicin, norfloxacin and nalidixic acid, were investigated. The result demonstrated that the strain was highly resistant to fosfomycin only. It was further shown that this resistance was transmissible with low frequency to Serratia marcescens whereas it was not transmissible to Escherichia coli.
