The ability of macrophages to phagocyte granulocyte debris ("cleaning" reaction) is evolutionary developed and represents the mechanism of cellular resistance preceding immunity. Activation of the mononuclear phagocyte system and acquisition by the macrophages of the capacity to the intracellular chlamydia destruction as well as other infectious agents parasitizing in the intact cells occurs in the process of the granulocyte debris phagocytosis. This phenomenon termed by the author as a resorptive cellular resistance is one of host barrier mechanisms.
