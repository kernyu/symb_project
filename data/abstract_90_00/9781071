There is no longer malaria transmission in Europe and North America, while the transmission decreases in sub-tropical areas and increases in tropical countries. Most of malarias are now due to Plasmodium falciparum and happen in Africa. In the regions where the transmission is high, malaria is stable, baby mortality is high, and protective immunity is achieved in early childhood. Falciparum resistant malaria originates from mutations on drug target decreasing affinity to antifols, or mutations preventing accumulation of chloroquine in parasitized red blood cells. Resistance is a rapid event following large use of antifols, even associated, while falciparum chloroquine resistance is now widespread. Resistance to quinine, mefloquine and halofantrine is still at low levels out of Thailand, as their use remains through medical hands. Non resistance was observed yet with artemisinin derivatives.
