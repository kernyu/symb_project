Five percent fine granule preparation of cefdinir (CFDN, FK482) was administered to 30 patients with acute febrile respiratory tract infections (RTI) at 4.9-21.1 mg/kg/day divided into 3 portions. And 10% fine granule preparation of CFDN was also administered to 11 patients with acute febrile RTI and 1 patient with urinary tract infection at 10.0-20.0 mg/kg/day divided into 3 portions. Good clinical effects observed in 21 of 24 patients (87.5%) with acute pharyngitis, 12 of 13 patients (92.3%) with acute tonsillitis, 2 of 4 patients (50.0%) with pneumonia and a patient with urinary tract infection. From these patients, 34 causative organisms were isolated. Ten (83.3%) of 12 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, all 6 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and 1 strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 6 (46.2%) of 13 strains of Haemophillus influenzae and 1 strain of Escherichia coli were eradicated from these patients. Among the patients with pneumonia, CFDN 20 mg/kg/day dose group showed better clinical responses and better bacteriological effects against H. influenzae among the patients given CFDN 20 mg/kg/day dose group than those given CFDN 5 mg/kg/day dose group. Side effects were noted in 2 cases, one case had soft stools and the other had diarrheas.
