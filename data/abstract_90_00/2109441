The paper deals with the results of clinical preparations for the application of allogenic bone marrow transplantation at the Clinic of Hematology in Novi Sad. The obligation of the definite treatment of patients below 45 years by allogenic and autologous bone marrow transplantation results from the acceptance of the Yugoslav protocols for acute leukaemia treatment. Thus immunogenotypical analyses, so far performed in patients with severe aplastic anaemia have been extended to patients with acute leukaemia as well and then to patients with chronic myelogenous leukaemia, high risk lymphocYtic lymphoma and myeloma multiplex with resistance to standard chemotherapy and their potential sibling donors. The bone marrow transplantation Unit has been set up, the team of specialists has been formed and educated and the protocol for allogenic transplantation with Busulfan and cyclophosphamide combination for pretransplant conditioning has been adopted. In research work concerning the field of bone marrow transplantation a particular emphasis has been put on the working out of a mathematical model for optimal timing of bone marrow transplantation in patients with acute myelogenous leukaemia.
