The aim of this study was to assess the occurrence of anaerobic non-sporeforming bacteria upper airways flora in the exacerbation of COPD. Sputum from 35 COPD patients was sent to the laboratory in sterile, filled with CO2 containers and cultured under anaerobic conditions. In all patients bacteriological tests were positive. The most common anaerobic bacteria were as follows: Peptostreptococcus - in 28 pts, Fusobacterium - in 27 pts, Bacteroides - in 26 pts and Prevotella in 24. Less common were: Propionibacterium, Actinomyces, Eubacterium, Porphyromonas and Peptococcus. The susceptibility to most common antimicrobial agents was evaluated. All anaerobic bacteria show a significant sensitivity to amoxicillin either with clavulanic acid or ampicillin with sulbactam. Gram-positive rods were resistant to metronidazole and tinidazole.
