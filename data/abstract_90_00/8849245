RP 59500, a combination of the streptogramins quinupristin and dalfopristin, and sparfloxacin are new antibiotics with good in vitro activities against Enterococcus faecium, which is an increasingly important nosocomial pathogen with resistance to multiple antimicrobials. Since fluoroquinolones and related macrolides have displayed high intracellular concentrations inside host cells, we evaluated the intracellular activities of these agents inside neutrophils against three strains each of vancomycin-susceptible E. faecium (VSEF) and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VREF). At concentrations equal to four times the MIC, RP 59500 and sparfloxacin decreased the number of intracellular VSEF organisms, while both antibiotics were at best bacteriostatic against intracellular VREF strains. At concentrations equal to one-fourth of the MIC, both antibiotics were bacteriostatic against intracellular VSEF strains but were ineffective in inhibiting the growth of VREF strains. Despite their anticipated markedly higher intracellular human neutrophil (PMN) concentrations, RP 59500 and sparfloxacin activities in medium alone were equal to or greater than those inside PMNs against almost all strains. We conclude that the intracellular PMN concentrations of these antibiotics may not be directly related to their intracellular activities in our assay. The reason for the differences in their activities against VSEF versus VREF remains undefined.
