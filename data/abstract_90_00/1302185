The evidence that secondary metabolites serve sophisticated roles in the survival strategy of the producer is briefly reviewed. This evidence stems from the common involvement of tens of kilobases of DNA in the programming of their synthesis, of up to several tens of discrete enzymic conversions in their biosynthesis, and of the existence of sophisticated mechanisms in the producers for resistance against their physiological effects. It also stems from a study of the molecular basis for these physiological effects. The molecular basis for the antibacterial action of the vancomycin group antibiotics is presented, and demonstrates that essentially every portion of these molecules appears to be finely honed to promote efficient antibacterial action.
