A strain of Enterococcus faecium SF 68 (sensitive to penicillin, tetracycline, virginiamicin and tylosin, but resistant to streptomycin) was administered to five groups of germ-free mice. Each group was subsequently given 40 micrograms/ml and then 80 micrograms/ml of a single antibiotic. The following determinations were made: a) colonization of the bacterial strain before and after administration of the antibiotic and b) the MICs in the original strain and after administration of the antibiotic (80 micrograms Iml). The results show that in the mice treated with streptomycin, colonization is not influenced by the antibiotic treatment; in mice treated with antibiotics to which the strain is sensitive, the colonization increases in proportion to the level of the antibiotic resistance (tylosin and tetracycline).
