Mutations of the rpoB gene conferring resistance to rifampin were analyzed in 40 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates obtained from six countries. Interestingly, the majority of clinical isolates showed multiple mutations within rpoB. The amino acid substitution 481His-->Asn was the most prevalent one, capable of conferring low-level resistance on its own. Cross-resistance to rifampin, rifabutin, and rifapentine was demonstrated for all mutants identified. The level of resistance to rifamycins correlated with both the mutation position and type of amino acid substitution.
