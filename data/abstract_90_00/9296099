Bactericidal activities of 8 antibiotics (ticarcillin, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem, amikacin, ciprofloxacin) and of 7 combinations have been studied by time-killing curve technique for 16 Pseudomonas aeruginosa selected for their beta-lactams resistance phenotypes (3 wild strains, 5 penicillinases, 2 extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, 3 high level cephalosporinases and 3 non enzymatic resistance). Bactericidal activities of beta-lactams used alone were as follows: imipenem > cefepime > ceftazidime, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam > ticarcillin. All the antibiotics combinations were synergistic or additive. However, only the combination of imipenem with amikacin was bactericidal for all strains. For the strains with penicillinases, piperacillin-tazobactam was not more effective than piperacillin. For the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, we have observed a synergy with piperacillin-tazobactam and ciprofloxacin or amikacin.
