Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and polymorphonuclear neutrophilic granulocytes (PMN) as well as embryonic equine dermal fibroblasts and the equine fibroblast line E. Derm which were used as controls, were treated with recombinant equine interferon-beta 1 (rEqIFN-beta 1) in vitro which induced the expression of different proteins in these cells. A 74 kDa protein was induced in PBMC and an 82 kDa protein was additionally found in the equine fibroblast E. Derm cell line following treatment with rEqFN-beta 1. Both proteins reacted with anti-mouse and anti-human Mx protein antisera in immunoblot tests. The 74 kDa and perhaps the 82 kDa components may thus represent equine 'Mxanalogous proteins'. The 74 kDa protein was only detected in PBMC of ten out of 20 horses examined. The induction of Mx protein in the horse by Type 1 interferon may therefore resemble that in the mouse, where Mx protein is involved in selective resistance to influenza virus. The influence of rEqIFN-beta 1 on protein expression in equine PBMC and PMN was monitored by metabolic labeling and 2-D gel electrophoresis. Proteins of 82, 74, 58 and 40 kDa were induced in PBMC following exposure to rEqIFN-beta 1. A constitutively expressed 35 kDa protein, however, was no longer demonstrable upon treatment with interferon. None of the proteins induced within PBMC was found in highly purified PMN treated with interferon. PMN exposed to rEqIFN-beta 1 synthesized four proteins in the range of 25 to 27 kDa. These proteins have not been described in interferon-treated PMN of any other species.
