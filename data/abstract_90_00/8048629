We studied the responses of total renal blood flow (RBF) and renal medullary blood flow (RMBF) to changes in renal perfusion pressure (RPP) within and below the range of renal autoregulation in the anesthetized dog (n = 7). To measure RMBF, we developed a technique in which the medulla is exposed by excising a section of infarcted cortex and a multiple optical fiber flow probe, connected to a laser-Doppler flowmeter, is placed on the medulla. At the baseline RPP of 120 +/- 1 mmHg, RBF was 2.58 +/- 0.33 ml.min-1.g perfused kidney wt-1, and RMBF was 222 +/- 45 perfusion units. RPP was then decreased in consecutive 20-mmHg steps to 39 +/- 1 mmHg. At 80 +/- 1 mmHg, RBF remained at 89 +/- 4% of the baseline value; however, RMBF had decreased significantly (P < 0.05) to 73 +/- 4% of its baseline value. The efficiency of autoregulation of RBF and of RMBF within the RPP range of 120 to 80 mmHg was determined by calculating an autoregulatory index (AI) for each parameter using the formula AI = (%delta blood flow)/(%delta RPP). An AI of 0 indicates perfect autoregulation, and an index of 1 indicates a system with a fixed resistance. The AI for RBF averaged 0.33 +/- 0.12 over this pressure range and showed a significantly greater (P < 0.05) autoregulatory ability than did the RMBF (0.82 +/- 0.13). Decreasing perfusion pressure < 80 mmHg produced significant decreases in both RBF and RMBF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
