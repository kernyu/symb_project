A complex comparative study of the characteristics of nonspecific resistance in different species of laboratory animals immunized with vaccine STI against anthrax has revealed the existence of marked interspecific differences between noninbred white mice, guinea pigs, rabbits and noninbred white rats in such characteristics as phagocytic activity, oxygen-dependent function of polymorphonuclear blood leukocytes, serum beta-lysin and lysozyme.
