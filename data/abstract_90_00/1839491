In a previous study (C. C. Hall, J. D. Watkins, and N. H. Georgopapadakou, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 33:322-325, 1989), the elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) from Staphylococcus aureus was found to be insensitive to a series of kirromycin analogs which were inhibitory to the EF-Tu from Escherichia coli. In the present study, the EF-Tu from S. aureus was partially purified and characterized. Its apparent molecular mass was approximately 41,000 Da, and the enzyme copurified with EF-Ts (molecular mass, 34,000 Da). S. aureus EF-Tu differed from its E. coli counterpart in that it bound negligible amounts of [3H]GDP, in addition to being insensitive to pulvomycin and aurodox (50% inhibitory concentrations, approximately 100 and 1,000 microM, respectively, versus 2 and 0.2 microM, respectively, for E. coli). The results are consistent with the formation of a stable EF-Tu.EF-Ts complex that affects the interaction of EF-Tu with guanine nucleotides and inhibitors.
