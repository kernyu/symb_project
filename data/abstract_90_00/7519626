To study the functional properties of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) from intact viral particles without the requirement for tissue culture expansion, a method that couples HIV-1 reverse transcription utilizing its endogenous RT (ERT) with polymerase chain reaction amplification (PCR) was developed. Detection of endogenous reverse transcripts from HIV particles by ERT-PCR was compared to HIV RNA PCR detection using avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) RT from plasma samples from 45 HIV-1 infected patients. The HIV ERT-PCR method was capable of detecting plasma viremia with the same efficiency (29/29 patients) as the AMV RT HIV RNA PCR in patients with CD4 cell counts of less than 500/mm3. The determination of HIV-RT drug sensitivities using four well-characterized HIV-1 lab strains was assessed. The ERT-PCR method detected reduced sensitivity to TIBO R82150 (10 microM) in a TIBO resistant strain but not in the TIBO sensitive HTLV-IIIB viral mixture or an HTLV-IIIB clone. In summary, the HIV ERT-PCR method provides a useful approach for the detection of HIV and the characterization of RT sensitivities among HIV-1 strains.
