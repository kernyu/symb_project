The purpose of this study was to characterize Escherichia coli isolates from avian cellulitis, particularly with respect to the occurrence of potential virulence factors. At slaughter, five broilers with lesions of cellulitis were selected from each of 20 farms from among the broilers processed. One hundred E. coli isolates from the lesions were characterized with respect to serotype; biotype; drug susceptibility; plasmid profile; ability to produce aerobactin, colicin, colicin V, and hemolysin; and cytotoxicity for Vero cells and chicken fibroblasts. The same properties were determined from a collection of 25 E. coli from the feces of chickens. Serotyping showed that, among the cellulitis isolates, 23 belonged to O group 78, 14 belonged to O2, eight belonged to O115, and seven belonged to O(21.83); 25 were untypable. Isolates from a single farm typically belonged to three to five O groups. More than half of the fecal isolates were untypable, and the rest were distributed among seven O groups. Biotype, drug-resistance pattern, and plasmid profile could not be used as markers of avian cellulitis E. coli. No plasmid was detected in 12% of cellulitis isolates and 48% of fecal isolates. No isolate was hemolytic or showed cytotoxic effects. Aerobactin was produced by 90% of cellulitis isolates, and colicin was produced by 85% of these isolates; the corresponding percentages for the fecal isolates were 16% and 40%. Production of colicin V was detected in 21% of cellulitis isolates and 24% of fecal isolates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
