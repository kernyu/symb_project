A questionnaire survey to examine worm control practices on angora and other goat farms in Denmark was undertaken in 1993. Questionnaires were inserted in the July, 1993 issue of the official journal of the angora goat farmers in Denmark (Mohair News) and 72 questionnaires posted directly to other goat farms selected from a list of 150 farms registered with the Goat Breeders Association. Data from 51 angora and 41 other goat farms indicated that anthelmintics were used on more than 80% of the farms. On 51% of the farms, no predetermined drenching programmes were followed. On 72% and 64% of the farms, kids (< 1 year of age) and adult goats (> 1 year old) were drenched 1-3, and two or three times per year, respectively. Only 9% of the farmers used the recommended weight of the heaviest animal in a herd to determine anthelmintic doses for groups of both kids and adult goats. Visual perception which may result in underdosing was used to determine weights for drenching on 41% and 69% of the farms for kids and adult goats, respectively. From 1986 to 1993, Class I anthelmintics (benzimidazoles) were the most commonly used. Anthelmintic classes were not alternated annually on the majority of farms, which would enhance selection for resistance. While the majority of farmers (58%) rotated goats regularly between paddocks, only 21% drenched the goats when being moved. Anthelmintic treatment for newly introduced goats was not carried out on 45% of 55 respondent farms, nine of which had imported stock. This increases the likelihood of introducing resistant worms to the farms.
