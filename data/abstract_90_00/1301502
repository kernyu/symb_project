Modern data on prevalence, structural and functional organization of the tetracycline resistance determinants in bacteria are reviewed. The three mechanisms of the antibiotic resistance are the tetracycline efflux, the ribosomal protection and the antibiotic modification. The problems of evolution of tetracycline resistance genes are discussed.
