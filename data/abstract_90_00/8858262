In order to evaluate the susceptibility of the microorganisms isolated from chronic suppurative otitis media to ciprofloxacin, cultures of specimens from 127 patients with chronic suppurative otitis media and their antibiotic sensitivity results were examined. The most common aerobic isolates were Pseudomonas sp., Proteus sp., and Staphylococcus aureus with recovery rates of 40.7%, 21.6% and 19.1% respectively. Sensitivity results showed that 6.2% of Pseudomonas isolates, 2.9% of Proteus isolates, 10% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates and 8.3% of Escherichia coli isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin.
