Expression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), the drug efflux pump which mediates multidrug resistance (MDR), has been widely reported in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and improved accumulation of daunorubicin has been reported using the MDR reversing agent cyclosporin A (CSA). We have investigated the effects on cell kill of the addition of CSA and its analogue PSC 833 to daunorubicin, doxorubicin, idarubicin, mitozantrone and fludarabine in samples from 51 patients with CLL using an MTT [3(4,5-dimethylthaizol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay. Pgp expression was assessed by immunocytochemistry using the JSB-1 monoclonal antibody. Of the 51 samples, 10 (20%) were Pgp positive and all of these samples were from treated patients. With the exception of mitozantrone, the addition of CSA and PSC 833 to cytotoxic agents failed to significantly improve cytotoxicity, even in the Pgp positive group. With mitozantrone significant responses were seen in both Pgp positive and negative groups suggesting that the responses were due to direct cytotoxicity of the cytotoxic-modifier combination rather than reversal of MDR. Both CSA and PSC 833 showed significant direct cytotoxicity (P = 0.004 and 0.04 for PSC 833 at 1000 ng/ml and 500 ng/ml respectively; P < 0.001 for both concentrations of CSA). The responses were disappointing compared to the highly significant improvements in cytotoxicity seen using cells from the Pgp positive CEM VLB 100 acute myeloid leukaemia cell line, and it was not possible to demonstrate the superiority of PSC 833 over CSA which is also seen in cell lines. Our data do not support a role for Pgp modifiers in CLL. Further studies using larger numbers of Pgp positive CLL cells and higher doses of PSC 833 would be useful.
