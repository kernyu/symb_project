The photosensitizer benzoporphyrin derivative monoacid ring A (BPD) has been investigated regarding its ability to destroy free and cell-associated human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) when activated by light. Experiments with free virus in tissue culture medium indicate that light-activated BPD was effective in rendering HIV uninfectious. Azidothymidine (AZT)-resistant strains of HIV appear equally susceptible to photodynamic inactivation under drug and light conditions that proved effective in inactivating AZT-sensitive strains of HIV. Experiments conducted on whole blood from individuals infected with HIV demonstrate that BPD and light treatment could significantly reduce cell-associated virus, under conditions that appear not to damage red blood cells. The amount of culturable virus from infected leukocytes surviving photodynamic treatment could be further reduced by the addition of AZT to the culture.
