The purpose was study the feasibility of ESHAP + G-CSF for peripheral blood hematopoietic progenitor cell (PBPC) mobilisation in resistant/relapsed Hodgkin's disease (HD) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Twenty-two consecutive patients with HD (8) and N-HL (14) received ESHAP chemotherapy and G-CSF (5 microg/Kg/d). When a minimum number of 10,000 peripheral blood CD34+ cells/mL was observed patients underwent leukapheresis until a CD34+ cell dose > or = 2.5x10(6)/Kg was collected or the PBPC peak was lost. Blood cells kinetics and toxicity were analysed. Data concerning the day of first apheresis, number of procedures per patient, and cellular yield of the aphereses were recorded. Correlation between the CD34+ cell content in the apheresis product and the two diagnosis groups was attempted. Twelve patients (54%) developed short-lived severe neutropenia (<0.5x10(9)/L). Thrombocytopenia (<25x10(9)/L) had a median duration of 1 day. Fever appeared in 4 patients and CN Staph bacteriemia in 2 cases. Bleeding events did not supervene and no deaths occurred. Aphereses started at day +15 (median) and the median number of apheresis/patient was 2. Seventeen patients underwent 1 or 2 leukaphereses. Thirteen patients (59%) achieved the CD34+ cell target in the first apheresis. NHL patients obtained statistically significant better CD34+ cell collections than HD. Only 2 HD patients failed to mobilise, 1 previously treated with high-dose therapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation. ESHAP + G-CSF has been shown to be feasible for PBPC mobilisation in resistant/relapsed lymphoma. Toxicity was low and CD34+ cell yield high, especially in N-HL. This mobilisation regimen should be further explored in a larger patient population.
