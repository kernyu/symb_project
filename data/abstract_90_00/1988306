In adult neutropenic patients with hematological malignancies, we explored imipenem-cilastatin as empirical antibiotic therapy in a dose of 500 mg four times daily. Changing to second-line treatment was only resorted to if clinical deterioration, new infections or recurrence of fever occurred. A clinically or microbiologically documented infection was apparent in 115 of 150 episodes studied (76.7%). Imipenem-cilastatin was successful in 70.7% of all episodes and in 67.8% of all proven infections. Modification was necessary and successful in 22.0% of all episodes. 11 patients died while still febrile, 6 of them by infection (4%) and 5 because of progressive disease (3.3%). Imipenem-cilastatin is safe initial therapy in neutropenic febrile patients.
