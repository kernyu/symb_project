Placental and fetal infections with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) were determined by virus titration, indirect fluorescence antibody (IFA), and in situ hybridization with cDNA probes. Experiments were designed to determine the effects of gestational age, timing of maternal LDV infection, and immunological (antibody and cytokine) factors on mouse placental and fetal LDV infection. Virus infection of the placenta was detected at high levels (almost all placentas infected) within 24 h post-maternal infection (p.m.i.), whereas fetal LDV infection was detected only at a low level by 24 h p.m.i. The percentage of fetuses becoming LDV infected progressively increased between 24 and 72 h p.m.i. When fetal infection was studied at 72 h p.m.i., earlier gestational ages (9-11 days) were associated with fetal resistance to infection, whereas between 12.5 and 15 days of gestation, virus infection was detected in 50-71% of fetuses. Maternal treatment with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) or anti-LDV monoclonal antibodies was associated with reduced rates of fetal, but not placental, LDV infection. These results demonstrate that both developmental and immunological factors are important in the regulation of transplacental LDV infection.
