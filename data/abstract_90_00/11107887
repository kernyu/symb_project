The antigenic structure and antimicrobial susceptibility were studied in 99 strains isolated from patients with acute diarrhea (6 strains from an outbreak of digestive transmission disease in Santiago de Cuba) and a strain isolated from a patient who died from infections neurological syndrome (INS, meningitis). Four new serotypes (093, 994, 095, 096), which had not been described in the world classification, were identified from the Cuban isolated strains and were included in the International Serotyping Scheme by the International Reference Center located in Prague, Czech Republic. For the first time in Cuba, the circulation of serotypes 017:H11, 011: H2, 023. H1alc, 057: H3 which show cross reaction to Shiguella species was proved. Those strains from the outbreak of digestive disease belonged to serotype 050: H11 and had a thermostable toxin. The first case of infectious neurologic syndrome with Plesionomas shigelloides etiology reported in Cuba was described; the strain corresponded to serotype 050: H11. The worldwide reported pattern of antimicrobial resistance was demonstrated.
