In these studies, heat radiosensitization in normal human colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) and several different leukemic cell lines sensitive or resistant to chemotherapeutic agents were measured. Extent of heat radiosensitization was then correlated with the level of DNA polymerases alpha and beta in control and heat-shocked cells in order to examine whether there is a positive correlation between the degree of heat radiosensitization and the level of these enzymes. Our results show that human bone marrow CFU-GM have an x-ray response with D0 of 1.56 Gy and a small amount of heat radiosensitization with a thermal enhancement ratio (TER) of 1.2. K562, a human erythroleukemic cell, showed a D0 of 1.32 +/- 0.2 Gy and TER of 1.4. However, in contrast to normal CFU-GM which showed no shoulder in the X-ray survival curve, K562 cells showed a small shoulder with a quasi-threshold dose, (Dq) of 2 Gy and n of 2. K562 cells resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs such as 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine and etoposide (VP-16) showed D0 of 1.47 +/- 0.13, and 1.77 +/- 0.18 Gy; Dq of 4 and 0 Gy; and n of 5 and 1; and TER of 1.6 and 2, respectively. The level of DNA polymerases alpha and beta activity and their respective mRNA levels were approximately the same in all cells. The reduction in the level of DNA polymerase beta after heat treatment however, correlated with the TER obtained for various leukemic cells. These studies indicate that normal CFU-GM and variety of human leukemic cells show only a small amount of heat radiosensitization. However, drug-resistant leukemic cells show a higher amount of heat radiosensitization than their drug-sensitive parent line. This suggests that hyperthermia may be beneficial in eradicating drug-resistant leukemic cells when combined with X-ray. Furthermore, the inactivation of DNA polymerase beta activity results in a higher amount of heat radiosensitization.
