Treatment of human HeLa and amnion U cells with gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), either alone or in combination with alpha interferon (IFN-alpha), reduced the steady-state level of mRNA encoding the catalytic (C) subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) as measured by Northern gel-blot (RNA) analysis. In addition, IFN-gamma treatment increased the ratio of C alpha to C alpha 2 (the two splice-site variants of PKA C alpha subunit mRNA produced in HeLa cells) as measured by a polymerase chain reaction assay. IFN-gamma greatly reduced the amount of a novel splice-site variant of PKA, C alpha 2, which retains introns G and H, relative to the amount of C alpha, which lacks introns G and H. IFN-alpha treatment in combination with IFN-gamma did not further reduce the level of PKA C alpha transcripts beyond that of IFN-gamma alone, as measured by Northern blots; however, IFN-alpha in combination with IFN-gamma did cause a synergistic increase in the level of human Mx transcripts.
