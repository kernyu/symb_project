We have recently developed a method of in vitro cultivation of P. falciparum using a portable incubator and AnaeroPack.CO2 (Onda et al.), we applied semi-microtechnique drug susceptibility tests to the culture method to evaluate the system using several P. falciparum strains or isolates of different susceptibilities to chloroquine (SGE-1, FCR-3, K-1, Patient 1 and 2). The new method gave comparable results to those shown by the standard test employing a modular incubator chamber with standard gas composition of 5% O2, 5% CO2 and 90% N2. Many useful data on the epidemiology of drug resistant malaria such as the emergence of multi-drug resistant isolates could be collected by applying this new method to the field survey.
