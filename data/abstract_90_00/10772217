Thermal and chemical resistance of five autochthonal bacteriophages of Streptococcus thermophilus, isolated from Cuartirolo cheese wheys and yogurt, was investigated. Times to obtain 99% inactivation of phages (T99) at 63 degrees C and 72 degrees C in three suspension media (enriched tryptic soy broth, reconstituted commercial nonfat skim milk, and tris magnesium gelatin buffer) were determined. The thermal resistance was dependent on the phages studied but not detectable counts (<10 PFU/ml) were only achieved by heating at 90 degrees C during 5 min. The data obtained for the three assayed media did not permit verifying significant differences among them. Sodium hypochlorite (100 ppm) provided a fast inactivation of bacteriophage particles (<10 PFU/ml after 5 min). Ethanol, at concentrations of 75% and 100%, was also effective for phage destruction. Isopropanol was slightly less effective than ethanol at the same concentrations. Peracetic acid (0.15%) was also a very effective agent for phage inactivation. The results showed that these autochthonal bacteriophages were not completely inactivated neither by normal pasteurization treatments nor by some biocides commonly used in disinfection, except sodium hypochlorite and peracetic acid. The practical implications of these findings have pointed out the necessity of recognizing the importance of establishing adequate conditions to assure effective thermal and chemical treatments in dairy plants and laboratory environments.
