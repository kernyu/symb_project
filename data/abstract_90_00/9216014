The susceptibility of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) to vancomycin (VC) is excellent, but excessive dosing of VC leads to severe side effects. In this study, we present a way of administration planning for each patient based on personal data. To this end, we employed the Sawchuck-Zaske equation to calculate VC clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (Vd) on the basis of three different plasma concentrations of VC, and we used CL and Vd values as prior information before employing the parameter estimation and dosage adjustment program to treat a patient with postsurgical endophthalmitis caused by MRSA and a patient with acute dacryocystitis also caused by MRSA. They had good remissions without any severe side effects.
