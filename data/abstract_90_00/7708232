Staphylococcus epidermidis is a bacterial organism found in almost 75% of such shunts becoming infected. This is due to its production of an extracellular slime responsible of adherence to implantable devices and resistance to antibiotic therapy. Use of antimicrobial prophylaxis prevents production of such slime. In 100 shunt operations the A. used antimicrobial prophylaxis with ceftriaxone (2 g before operation). Follow up of 3 years showed no shunt infection. Choice of ceftriaxone was due to its pharmacokinesis.
