Since 1995 patients with infections with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have been reported in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. From prevalence studies in the Netherlands at the end of 1995 and the start of 1996, it appeared that 2% of the patients studied in and outside hospitals had VRE. Restrictive antibiotic prescription in human and veterinary medicine is indicated in order to postpone the problem.
