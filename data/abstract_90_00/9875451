To elucidate of role(s) of tTA as a repressor in the tTA-mediated gene repression system, we introduced mutations into the acidic domain of VP16 and examined the effects of such various mutations. In the transient repression experiment, a region containing 34 amino acids of the activation domain of VP16 (412-456) which interacts with TFIIB was found to be necessary and sufficient for the tTA-mediated repression of gene expression. However, in the experiment to investigate the fact that tTA-regulated repression is related to the activation function of VP 16, we found that the repression abilities of tTA derivatives did not correlate exactly with their activation abilities. Therefore, we conclude that increased mass of VP16 in tTA might be also important for efficient repression in addition to functional domain of VP16.
