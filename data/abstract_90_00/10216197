Extracellular 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA) and quinine depolarized the neuropile glial cell membrane and decreased its input resistance. As 4-AP induced the most pronounced effects, we focused on the action of 4-AP and clarified the ionic mechanisms involved. 4-AP did not only block glial K+ channels, but also induced Na+ and Ca2+ influx via other than voltage-gated channels. The reversal potential of the 4-AP-induced current was -5 mV. Application of 5 mM Ni2+ or 0.1 mM d-tubocurarine reduced the 4-AP-induced depolarization and the associated decrease in input resistance. We therefore suggest that 4-AP mediates neuronal acetylcholine release, apparently by a presynaptic mechanism. Activation of glial nicotinic acetylcholine receptors contributes to the depolarization, the decrease in input resistance, and the 4-AP-induced inward current. Furthermore, the 4-AP-induced depolarization activates additional voltage-sensitive K+ and Cl- channels and 4-AP-induced Ca2+ influx could activate Ca2+-sensitive K+ and Cl- channels. Together these effects compensate and even exceed the 4-AP-mediated reduction in K+ conductance. Therefore, the 4-AP-induced depolarization was paralleled by a decreasing input resistance.
