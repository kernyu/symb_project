In an effort to study the mechanism underlying the observed phenotype-specific response of human lung cancer cell lines to a polyamine analogue, N1,N12-bis(ethyl)spermine(BESpm), we have isolated a BESpm resistant cell line from the BESpm-sensitive large cell lung carcinoma line NCI H157. The mutant line exhibits identical growth rates in the presence or absence of the analogue. However, the overall growth of mutant cells reaches stationary phase earlier than that of the parental cells. In contrast to the parental cells, where a superinduction of spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) is associated with BESpm toxicity, treatment of this resistant line with BESpm did not induce SSAT mRNA or enzyme activity. BESpm treatment was not effective in depleting the intracellular polyamine pools and very low intracellular BESpm levels were detected. This BESpm resistance is not mediated by multidrug resistance (MDR) protein, since these cells maintain their sensitivity to the antineoplastic agent adriamycin. Treatment of these cells with methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) (MGBG), an AdoMetDC inhibitor which enters cell using polyamine transport system, shows no inhibition of cell growth. Our data suggest that these mutant cells are deficient in polyamine transport. Consistent with this hypothesis, exogenous polyamines did not prevent difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) induced growth inhibition in the mutant cells.
