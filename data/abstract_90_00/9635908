The in vitro activities of six fluoroquinolones were determined against 1482 Enterococcus species isolates collected as part of a 1996 Canadian surveillance study. Clinafloxacin MIC90s were 4 or 8 microg/mL, trovafloxacin and BAY 12-8039 MIC90s were 8 or 16 microg/mL, sparfloxacin MIC90s were 32 microg/mL, and ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin MIC90s were >32 microg/mL for the vancomycin-sensitive Enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-sensitive Enterococcus faecium, and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium isolates collected.
