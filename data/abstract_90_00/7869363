The intracellular distribution of the anthracyclinic antibiotic adriamycin in living cultured cells has been investigated by confocal microscopy. In human melanoma cells (M14), adriamycin was localized inside the nuclei. When adriamycin-treated M14 cells were allowed to recover in drug-free medium, a complete efflux of the drug from the nucleus was revealed. In recovered cells, a weakly fluorescent signal was observed in the perinuclear region. When M14 cells were recovered in a medium containing colcemid, a microtubule depolymerizing agent, the drug transport from the nucleus to the cell periphery appeared to be inhibited, suggesting that the microtubule network is strongly involved in drug transport mechanisms. In multidrug-resistant (MDR) cells the intracellular location of adriamycin was shown to be noticeably different from that of the parental wild-type cells. In particular, in resistant human breast carcinoma cells (MCF-7), adriamycin appeared to be exclusively located within the cytoplasm whereas the nuclei were shown to be completely negative. When adriamycin treatment was performed in association with MDR revertants, such as Lonidamine (inhibitor of the energy metabolism) or verapamil (inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein efflux pump), a marked enhancement of the cytoplasmic signal was observed in resistant cells. Under these conditions, adriamycin appeared concentrated in the perinuclear region, but the nuclei were still negative. Confocal microscopy proved to be a very useful method for the study of the intracellular transport of fluorescent substances, such as anthracyclinic antibiotics, and for the investigation of the multidrug resistance phenomenon in tumour cells.
