The efficacy of treatment with cambendazole was tested in 1-year-old horses on a farm in Dubrovka, Ukraine. Thirty-five horses were treated. Their egg output was compared on the day of treatment and 14 days later with that of 33 untreated horses. Before treatment the mean number of eggs g-1 faeces was 614 in the controls and 766 in horses that had been treated. After 14 days the mean egg output in the controls was 580 and in the treated horses 369. This means a reduction of 54.5%. Only cyathostome larvae could be cultured from faeces collected after treatment. It can be concluded that benzimidazole resistance in cyathostomes is present in the Ukraine.
