This study describes results of in vitro examination of susceptibility to metronidazole of clinical strains of Helicobacter pylori isolated from patients with gastritis. The susceptibility was determined by disc diffusion test. H. pylori was isolated from 44 (67.7%) of patients. Thirty six (81.8%) of the strains were resistant to metronidazole: 17 (85%) from 20 strains isolated from women and 19 (79.2%) from 24 strains isolated from men. This study emphasises the importance of monitoring the drug resistance of H. pylori during therapy.
