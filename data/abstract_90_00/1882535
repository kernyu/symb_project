A method to prevent operative wound suppuration is offered. An experimental animal model of operative wound suppuration was elaborated to specify rational antibiotic-antiseptic prophylaxis and adequate wound drainage. This yielded a complex of measures to prevent purulent complications on the part of the operative wound. In addition, an original turbidimetric technique to assess the resistance of the biological fluid microflora to antisepsis was elaborated. The complex prophylaxis against suppuration of infected wounds was clinically tested on 124 patients operated on for different acute surgical conditions of abdominal organs. The wound process was controlled by means of an original endoscopic-bacteriologic technique. The postoperative period was complicated by the wound suppuration in two of the 124 patients (1.6 per cent). The postoperative hospital stay in most cases lasted 5-7 days.
