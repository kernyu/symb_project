Acidiphilium multivorum AIU 301 isolated from acid mineral water had strong arsenic resistance. This bacterium harbored a number of plasmids with different molecular sizes. A plasmid of 56 kbp, named pKW301, was isolated from A. multivorum AIU 301. When pKW301 was transferred into Escherichia coli JM109 by electroporation, an E. coli transformant carrying pKW301 exhibited resistance to sodium arsenite, sodium arsenate, and mercuric (II) chloride.
