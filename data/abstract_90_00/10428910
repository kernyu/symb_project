The susceptibilities of Streptococcus pneumoniae (1,476 strains) and untypeable Haemophilus influenzae (1,676 strains) to various oral beta-lactam, macrolide-azalide, and fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents were determined by broth microdilution. Organisms were isolated from specimens obtained from outpatients in six geographic regions of the United States. MIC data were interpreted according to pharmacodynamically derived breakpoints applicable to the oral agents tested. Among H. influenzae strains, 41.6% were beta-lactamase positive. Virtually all H. influenzae strains were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanate (98%), cefixime (100%), and ciprofloxacin (100%), while 78% were susceptible to cefuroxime, 57% were susceptible to amoxicillin, 14% were susceptible to cefprozil, 9% were susceptible to loracarbef, 2% were susceptible to cefaclor, and 0% were susceptible to azithromycin and clarithromycin. Among S. pneumoniae isolates, 49.6% were penicillin susceptible, 17.9% were intermediate, and 32.5% were penicillin resistant, with penicillin MICs for 50 and 90% of the isolates tested of 0.12 and 4 microg/ml, respectively. Overall, 94% of S. pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate, 69% were susceptible to azithromycin and clarithromycin, 63% were susceptible to cefprozil and cefuroxime, 52% were susceptible to cefixime, 22% were susceptible to cefaclor, and 11% were susceptible to loracarbef. Although ciprofloxacin has marginal activity against S. pneumoniae, no high-level fluoroquinolone-resistant strains were found. Significant cross-resistance was found between penicillin and macrolides-azalides among S. pneumoniae isolates, with 5% of the penicillin-susceptible strains being macrolide-azalide resistant, compared with 37% of the intermediate isolates and 66% of the resistant isolates. Resistance was highest in S. pneumoniae isolates from patients younger than 10 years of age, middle ear and paranasal sinus specimens, and the southern half of the United States. With the continuing rise in resistance, judicious use of oral antimicrobial agents is necessary in all age groups.
