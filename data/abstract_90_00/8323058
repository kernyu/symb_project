Vaginal aerobic bacterial flora was studied in 5 healthy bitches before, during, and after a 10-day period of treatment with ampicillin and an equally long period of treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Blood variables and antimicrobial drug susceptibility also were studied. Bacteria were isolated from all bitches before the first treatment period. Bitches from which only a sparse number of bacteria were isolated had flora that varied from day to day. In most instances when bitches were given an antibiotic to which their vaginal bacterial flora was susceptible, these bacteria were eradicated after only 1 day of treatment. This was true for pasteurella, streptococci, and, in all but one case, Escherichia coli. Staphylococcus intermedius was more difficult to eradicate, and, although susceptible in vitro, it was unaffected by antibiotic treatment in 1 bitch and it took 7 days to eradicate in another. Eradication of aerobic bacteria in the vagina was total only in the bitch that had sparse flora from the beginning. Bacteria colonized within 0 (in 4/5 bitches) to 4 days after termination of treatment with ampicillin and within 0 (in 4/5 bitches) to 3 days for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Mycoplasmas emerged during and after both treatment periods, and E coli became apparent during treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Because mycoplasmas may be genital pathogens in bitches and E coli is a common uropathogen, their appearance should be an argument against widespread use of antibiotics in healthy breeding bitches. Two bitches developed a vaginal discharge during treatment or shortly after. Blood variables did not change during the study, nor did antimicrobial drug resistance of the isolated bacteria.
