Oxygenated chalcones (3a,b) and bischalcones (4a-j) have been synthesized and evaluated for antimalarial activity against chloroquine sensitive and resistant strains of Plasmodium berghei in mice. Some of the screened compounds, 3a, 4c, 4e, 4f and 4i, have shown significant activity at 100 mg/kg dose against sensitive strain.
