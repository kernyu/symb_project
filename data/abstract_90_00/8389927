Polarized epithelial cells represent the primary barrier to virus infection of the host, which must also be traversed prior to virus dissemination from the infected organism. Although there is considerable information available concerning the release of enveloped viruses from such cells, relatively little is known about the processes involved in the dissemination of nonenveloped viruses. We have used two polarized epithelial cell lines, Vero C1008 (African green monkey kidney epithelial cells) and Caco-2 (human intestinal epithelial cells), infected with poliovirus and investigated the process of virus release. Release of poliovirus was observed to occur almost exclusively from the apical cell surface in Caco-2 cells, whereas infected Vero C1008 cells exhibited nondirectional release. Structures consistent with the vectorial transport of virus contained within vesicles or viral aggregates were observed by electron microscopy. Treatment with monensin or ammonium chloride partially inhibited virus release from Caco-2 cells. No significant cell lysis was observed at the times postinfection when extracellular virus was initially detected, and transepithelial resistance and vital dye uptake measurements showed only a moderate decrease. Brefeldin A was found to significantly and specifically inhibit poliovirus biosynthetic processes by an as yet uncharacterized mechanism. The vectorial release of poliovirus from the apical (or luminal) surface of human intestinal epithelial cells has significant implications for viral pathogenesis in the human gut.
