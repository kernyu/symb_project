Burn wound sepsis is still a common cause of death in burn injuries. Eighty percent of this infection is with colonisation from the patient and twenty percent as a result of cross infection. Most of the mortality is due to virulent cross infection. Pseudomonas has almost disappeared and multiple resistant staphylococcus aureus is the main pathogen today. It can cause loss of skin grafts and septicaemia, particularly due to colonisation of intravenous lines. The risk increases with the time since the burn injury. Early excision and grafting is important. With a large burn it is not possible to do this in one session and so the risk is increased with a compromised patient. Maintenance of a good diet and vitamin supplements is important, preferably orally or through a naso-gastric tube. Parenteral nutrition increases the risk of infection. Clinical infection is combated by good cleaning procedures, preferably with chlorhexidine solution and the application of a good topical agent such as Silvazine. The presence of bacteria in the wound must be monitored. Strict barrier nursing and personal hygiene, particularly hand washing, are the mainstay of cross infection prevention. Antibiotics may be required, monitored by blood cultures. Documenting MRSA is a good way to monitor the unit's infection prevention programme. The main preventive measures are early referral, early excision and grafting, good nutritional support, good topical agents and barrier nursing.
