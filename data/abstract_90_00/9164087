We evaluated the relationship between rifampicin (RFP)-susceptibility and genetic alterations in rpoB gene of clinically isolated Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains, collected from different geographic locations within Japan. Alterations in rpoB gene were detected by PCR-direct sequencing analysis, and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of RFP were determined by broth microdilution method using Middlebrook 7H9 broth. One hundred and sixty six epidemiologically unrelated M. tuberculosis strains were examined. A total of 99 genetic alterations in the 69 bp core region of rpoB gene were detected in 95 out of 166 strains. Among them, 96 out of 166 strains showed RFP-resistant phenotypes with MICs > or = 2 micrograms/ml. Examination of the correlation between the MICs of RFP and amino acid substitutions in 69 bp core region of rpoB gene revealed that 58 out of 59 strains containing amino acid substitution in codon 531 showed highly RFP-resistant phenotypes with MICs > or = 64 micrograms/ml. In contrast, a variable level of RFP-susceptibility was observed among strains containing amino acid substitutions in either codon 516 or 526. On the other hand, the MICs of three strains with a point mutation in either codon 515 or 533 were all < or = 1 microgram/ml. Our results suggest that rpoB gene sequencing is useful for not only the detection of RFP-resistant M. tuberculosis strains, but also the prediction of RFP-susceptibility of the strains.
