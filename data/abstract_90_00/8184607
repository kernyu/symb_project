The comparative study of the biological properties of H. influenzae strains isolated from healthy children and from patients with acute and chronic respiratory diseases has been made, taking into account the biochemical features (biotypes) and adhesive activity of these strains. Differences in various biotypes of H. influenzae strains isolated from patients with bronchopulmonary diseases and from healthy carriers have been established. H. influenzae strains isolated from various sources differ by their adhesive properties: strains isolated from patients with acute bronchopulmonary diseases have the highest adhesive activity, while strains isolated from healthy controls have the lowest adhesive activity. The data thus obtained indicate the possible dependence of the degree and duration of the colonization of the respiratory tract by H. influenzae on the biological properties of these microorganisms. The monitoring of the sensitivity of H. influenzae strains to antibiotics has demonstrated that these strains retain high sensitivity to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin and exhibit a tendency towards an increase in resistance to penicillin and erythromycin.
