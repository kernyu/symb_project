The interrelationships among glucose uptake, GLUT-4 protein, and citrate synthase activity in insulin-resistant skeletal muscle were investigated. Female obese (fa/fa) Zucker rats were randomly assigned to treadmill training, ingestion of the selective beta 2-adrenergic agonist clenbuterol, or sedentary control groups. After 7-8 wk of treatment, hindlimbs were perfused to determine maximal insulin-stimulated (10 mU/ml) 2-[3H]deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) uptake. Exercise training significantly enhanced 2-DG uptake and GLUT-4 protein in red gastrocnemius and plantaris. Alternatively, 2-DG uptake was not altered in soleus after exercise training despite a 52% increase in GLUT-4 protein. The increases in GLUT-4 protein in red gastrocnemius, plantaris, and soleus of the trained rats were accompanied by increases in citrate synthase activity. In contrast to exercise training, clenbuterol administration decreased citrate synthase activity in red and white gastrocnemius, yet had no effect on GLUT-4 protein levels or maximal insulin-stimulated 2-DG uptake. Clenbuterol treatment did, however, increase citrate synthase activity and GLUT-4 protein in soleus. These findings indicate that total GLUT-4 protein largely determines the maximal rate of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in fast-twitch muscle, whereas in slow-twitch muscle it does not. In addition, the results demonstrate that coordination of proteins governing glucose uptake and disposal may be disrupted in a fiber type-specific manner. Overall, the findings raise important questions as to whether regulation of proteins governing glucose uptake and disposal differs significantly among fiber types.
