A laboratory surveillance study was developed in Brazil in 1993 to determine capsular types and antimicrobial susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae strains. By studying 360 strains isolated from children with invasive infections in three different cities, 8 out of 34 types were identified as being the most prevalent and considered as the reference group for further analyses. This group comprised 77.7% of all strains studied, and includes the types 1, 5, 6A/B, 9V, 14, 19F, 19A, and 23F. The prevalence of this reference group was significantly higher among strains isolated from children with pneumonia than meningitis. Similarly, this group was more prevalent among strains isolated from children 3 to 6 years of age than from children under 2 years of age. Most strains (78.6%) were found to be susceptible to penicillin and only 1.4% showed high resistance to this antibiotic. However, intermediate resistance to penicillin was detected in 20% of the strains. This laboratory surveillance will be maintained and extended to other cities of Brazil to better define and monitor the trends of pneumococcal infections for proper control and prevention.
