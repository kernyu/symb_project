LY191145 is a p-chlorobenzyl derivative of LY264826 (A82846B) with activity against both vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococci. Incorporation of L-[14C]lysine into peptidoglycan of intact vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant Enterococcus faecium was inhibited by LY191145 (50% inhibitory concentrations of 1 and 5 microgram/ml, respectively). Inhibition was accompanied by accumulation of UDP-muramyl-peptide precursors in the cytoplasm. This agent inhibited late-stage steps in peptidoglycan biosynthesis in permeabilized E. faecium when either the UDP-muramyl-pentapeptide precursor from vancomycin-susceptible E. faecium or the UDP-muramyl-pentadepsipeptide precursor from vancomycin-resistant E. faecium was used as a substrate. Inhibition of late-stage steps led to accumulation of an N-acetyl-[14C]glucosamine-labeled lipid intermediate indicative of inhibition of the transglycosylation step. Inhibition of peptidoglycan polymerization without affecting cross-linking in a particulate membrane-plus-wall-fragment assay from Aerococcus viridans was consistent with this explanation. The fact that inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis by LY191145 was not readily antagonized by an excess of free acyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine or acyl-D-alanyl-D-lactate ligands indicates that the manner in which this compound inhibits transglycosylation may not be identical to that of vancomycin.
