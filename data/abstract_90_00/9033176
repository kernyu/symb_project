For the past 3 years, ofloxacin has been widely used in treating patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis in Taiwan. To study its usefulness in treating these patients, 139 isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from patients treated at the Taiwan Provincial Chronic Disease Control Bureau from September 1994 to September 1995 were tested to determine the in vitro antituberculosis activity of ofloxacin. Of these, 131 had not been previously exposed to ofloxacin, and 130 (99.2%) were susceptible to ofloxacin. Sixty-four isolates were found to be susceptible to all conventional antituberculosis drugs, and all of these were also susceptible to ofloxacin. Of the remaining 67 isolates that were resistant to one or more conventional antituberculosis drugs, 66 (98.5%) were susceptible to ofloxacin. There was no association between susceptibility to ofloxacin and susceptibility to conventional antituberculosis drugs among the isolates tested. Of the eight isolates of M. tuberculosis previously exposed to ofloxacin, seven (87.5%) were resistant. Our results indicate that patients with multidrug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis who have not received prior ofloxacin treatment may be safely treated with ofloxacin even without knowing the result of pretreatment ofloxacin susceptibility tests. We also found that ofloxacin resistance emerges frequently. Therefore, an adequate combination of antituberculosis drugs, along with ofloxacin, should be prescribed to prevent the development of resistance to ofloxacin.
