We have examined the ability of SV40 to induce changes in drug or temperature resistance in mouse, hamster, and mouse-human hybrid cells. SV40 induced a substantial increase of cells resistant to 5-bromodeoxyuridine + trifluorothymidine in Balb/c 3T3 cells and induced an increase of hybrid cells resistant to 6-thioguanine. SV40 was found to be nonmutagenic or weakly mutagenic in other test systems. The 3T3 cells were T-antigen positive, exhibited a marked reduction in TK activity, were heterogeneous for [3H]BrdU incorporation by autoradiography, and exhibited instability of the drug-resistance phenotype, suggesting that SV40 may be inducing resistance by an epigenetic process. SV40-induced 6-thioguanine resistance in the hybrids appears to occur predominantly by chromosome loss.
