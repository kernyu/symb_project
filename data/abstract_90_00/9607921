The serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 (PAI-2) is well characterized as an inhibitor of extracellular urokinase-type plasminogen activator. Here we show that intracellular, but not extracellular, PAI-2 protected cells from the rapid cytopathic effects of alphavirus infection. This protection did not appear to be related to an effect on apoptosis but was associated with a PAI-2-mediated induction of constitutive low-level interferon (IFN)-alpha/beta production and IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) activation, which primed the cells for rapid induction of antiviral genes. This primed phenotype was associated with a rapid development of resistance to infection by the PAI-2 transfected cells and the establishment of a persistent productive infection. PAI-2 was also induced in macrophages in response to viral RNA suggesting that PAI-2 is a virus response gene. These observations, together with the recently demonstrated PAI-2-mediated inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-alpha induced apoptosis, (a) illustrate that PAI-2 has an additional and distinct function as an intracellular regulator of signal transduction pathway(s) and (b) demonstrate a novel activity for a eukaryotic serpin.
