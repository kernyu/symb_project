A phenomenon of bacteriocinogeny is studied in 83 K-type strains of Klebsiella. Physicochemical (permeability through cellophane, thermo-resistance, diffusion rate in agar, inactivation by trypsin, induction by UV irradiation) and biological (activity spectrum, specificity) properties are studied. Eight preparations of klebocins are examined by electron microscopy. Conclusions are made on the possibility to use klebocinogenic and indicating K-type cultures of Klebsiella for bacteriocin typing of clinical isolates of these microbes.
