Conjugal transfer of a multiresistance plasmid from Pseudomonas fluorescens to halophilic and halotolerant bacteria was studied under in vitro and in situ conditions. Mating conducted in broth as well as on plates yielded a plasmid transfer frequency of as high as 10(-3). Among these two, plate mating facilitated conjugal transfer of plasmid, because the cell-to-cell contact is more in plate mating. When P. fluorescens was incubated in seawater, the organism progressively lost its colony forming activity within 15 days. Microscopic examination revealed the presence of very short rods, indicating that the cells have become viable but nonculturable (VNC). Mating conducted in natural seawater without any added nutrients revealed that the conjugal transfer is influenced by the physical state of the donor and the recipients as well as the availability of nutrients. But a plasmid transfer frequency of 10(-7) was obtained even after the donor cells have become VNC suggesting that the nonculturable state and nutrient deprived condition may not limit plasmid transfer. The results suggest that the terrestrial bacteria entering into the seawaters with antibiotic resistance plasmids may be responsible for the prevalence of resistance genes in the marine environment.
