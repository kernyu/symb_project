The phenomenon of resistance to azidothymidine during the infection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is reviewed. Different aspects of AZT resistance, including biological and virological characteristics of resistant HIV isolates, genetical mechanisms of resistance, cross-resistance to other nucleoside analogs and non-nucleoside inhibitors, are analyzed. The role of target cells in AZT resistance is also discussed.
