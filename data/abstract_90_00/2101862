Esophageal candidosis was found endoscopically in 135 of 496 AIDS patients with upper gastrointestinal symptoms. Vomiting, dysphagia and retrosternal pain were the leading symptoms. Endoscopy showed different stages of esophagitis with Candida patches as early changes up to severe esophagitis with hemorrhage. 36 patients were treated with fluconazole orally or intravenously administered (100 mg per day). In 33 of 36 patients clinical, endoscopic and microbiological results were good with complete cure of the lesions after 7, 14 or 21 days of treatment. In 3 patients with wasting syndrome and severe opportunistic infections a resistance to the drug was discussed because of lack of sufficient therapy results. Maintenance therapy seems to be necessary to prevent relapses.
