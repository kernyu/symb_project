Tet(M) protein interacts with the protein biosynthesis machinery to render this process resistant to tetracycline by a mechanism which involves release of the antibiotic from the ribosome in a reaction dependent on GTP hydrolysis. To clarify this resistance mechanism further, the interaction of Tet(M) with the ribosome has been examined by using a gel filtration assay with radioactively labelled Tet(M) protein. The presence of GTP and 5'-guanylyl imido diphosphate, but not GDP, promoted Tet(M)-ribosome complex formation. Furthermore, thiostrepton, which inhibits the activities of elongation factor G (EF-G) and EF-Tu by binding to the ribosome, blocks stable Tet(M)-ribosome complex formation. Direct competition experiments show that Tet(M) and EF-G bind to overlapping sites on the ribosome.
