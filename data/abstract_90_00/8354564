An outbreak called 'Dombivali fever' started in March 1990 and spread rapidly all over Bombay and adjoining area. A concomitant and steady increase in multidrug resistant Salmonella typhi isolation was observed. Later this outbreak called 'Dombivali fever' was proved to be resistant typhoid fever only. The present paper deals with comparison of this outbreak with previous two years laboratory data from Sir J.J. Hospital, Bombay. A very high isolation rate of S. typhi (215 isolates) in 1990 as compared to 62 isolates in the last two years (1988-89), was observed in this laboratory. The incidence of multidrug resistance in cases of enteric fever (EF) was also very high (67.6%) in 1990, as compared to 6.2% in 1988 and 23.3% in 1989. All the strains tested in 1990 were sensitive to ciprofloxacin.
