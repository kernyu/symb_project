We present three patients with otogenic meningitis, whose illness varied in extent and clinical course. Meningitis and otitis media are associated in 19-22% of all meningitis-patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the predominant microorganism with hemophilus influenzae being the second most important. We discuss the importance and problems of spinal puncture, early CT-scan as well as further, more extensive and sophisticated examinations to exclude late complications or predisposing factors. We emphasize an early start of antibiotic treatment, which should not be delayed for diagnostic reasons. With the appearance of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci antibiotic therapy may become more difficult in the future, but for the moment pneumococcal infections in Switzerland can initially still be treated with cephalosporins or high dose penicillin. The use of steroids, although of unproven efficacy, may be considered in some cases. An otolaryngologist should initially be consulted for diagnostic reasons as well as for possibly indicated early surgery.
