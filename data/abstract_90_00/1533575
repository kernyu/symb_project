Changes in the mechanisms of folate incorporation were studied in cells treated with low concentrations of methotrexate in order to evaluate their contribution to the development of resistance to antifolate drugs. The uptake of methotrexate via reduced-folate system, the membrane-associated high-affinity folate binding capacity and the activity, levels and affinity for methotrexate of dihydrofolate reductase were measured in L5178 murine leukemic lymphoblasts and in a subline, MTX/R16, 16 times more resistant to methotrexate which was isolated after a short exposure to the antifolate. Various simultaneous changes were characterized in MTX/R16 cells which co-participated in the development of resistance: a decreased affinity of the carrier for methotrexate uptake via the reduced-folate system of entry, the increase of dihydrofolate reductase activity and levels and a two-fold increased expression of a membrane-associated high-affinity folate-binding protein (mFBP). The increase of the mFBP expression, besides ensuring the growth of resistant cells by its contribution to the reduced folate intake, also participates in the methotrexate resistance by the internalization of folate cofactor which would compete with methotrexate hindering the effective inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase by the antifolate.
