A case of Lactobacillus rhamnosus-associated peritonitis in a patient undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis is reported. The patient was treated with vancomycin after isolation of glycopeptide-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci. After a skin rash developed, vancomycin was discontinued and replaced with teicoplanin. Seven weeks after the glycopeptide therapy was discontinued, a Lactobacillus strain was isolated in pure cultures. The isolate was identified first incorrectly as L. acidophilus but later correctly as L. rhamnosus. Antibiotic susceptibility testing showed that the isolate was resistant to glycopeptides but susceptible to several other antibiotics. The antibiotic treatment was then switched to imipenem and was successful.
