Fifteen weaned crossbred (Suffolk x Louisiana Native) lambs were treated with albendazole (10 mg kg-1) to remove existing nematode infections. They were inoculated with Haemonchus contortus infective larvae from a residual population surviving treatment with the oral formulation of ivermectin (0.2 mg kg-1). One group of five lambs remained untreated, another group of five was treated with the injectable formulation of ivermectin (0.2 mg kg-1), and a third group of five was treated with the oral formulation of ivermectin (0.2 mg kg-1). Subsequent to the treatments, there was essentially no difference in mean fecal egg count or mean number of H. contortus recovered at necropsy between the three groups.
