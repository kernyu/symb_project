Cefixime (CFIX) was evaluated clinically in pediatric respiratory tract infections, particularly those caused by Haemophilus influenzae: 1. The total number of children in this study treated with CFIX was 232, out of which 215 cases were evaluated for clinical efficacy and 224 cases were investigated for safety. A daily dosage of 3-6 mg/kg/day was given divided into 2 to 3 times daily for 3-15 days. 2. Causative organisms were identified in 146 cases, out of which 128 cases were found to be single microbial infections and 18 cases were mixed infections. In single microbial infections, clinical efficacy was 100% for those caused by H. influenzae/Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and was 95% for Streptococcus pyogenes with an overall efficacy of 96.9%. In mixed infections, the clinical efficacy was 100% for those caused by a combination of H. influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and the overall rate was 94.4%. An involvement of H. influenzae was observed in 108 cases with a clinical efficacy rate of 99.1%, and definite involvement of beta-lactamase secreting strains of H. influenzae was found in 32 cases with a clinical efficacy of 96.9%. 3. Bacteriological effect was studied for 164 strains identified in 146 cases, and eradication rates were 89.5% for H. influenzae, 100% for H. parainfluenzae and S. pyogenes, and 71.4% for S. pneumoniae. The overall eradication rate was 91.4%. Superinfection was observed in 21 cases. MICs against 78 strains of H. influenzae were in a range of less than or equal to 0.10 microgram/ml regardless of beta-lactamase production, and far superior to cefaclor and amoxicillin. MICs against S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae were in ranges of less than or equal to 0.10 microgram/ml and 0.39 micrograms/ml, respectively. 4. Clinical efficacy was 93.0% in 215 cases (excellent: 136, good: 64, fairly good: 10, poor: 5). CFIX attained a high efficacy in the range of 89.4-95.7% in acute pharyngitis, acute tonsillitis, acute bronchitis and acute pneumonia. 5. Safety was monitored in 224 cases and there were only one case of loose stool and another of diarrhea as side effects. There were no abnormal findings in 31 cases of the laboratory test. In conclusion, it was confirmed that CFIX is excellent and safe in the treatment of the respiratory tract infections.
