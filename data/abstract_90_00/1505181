In working situations where there is a possibility of acquiring blood-borne infections, the use of disinfectants is important. It is also important to use protective gloves, both to protect the skin against disinfectants and to protect against infections. Changes in the structure of the glove material may, however, interfere with the protective capability of the gloves. The influence of 4 disinfectants on the material structure and protective effect of 6 different brands of protective gloves was studied. The proposed International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard method for determining the liquid chemical resistance of air-impermeable materials was used for permeation testing. Pieces of latex and vinyl glove were also exposed to isopropanol and ethanol for 10, 30 and 60 min and then viewed in a scanning electron microscope. Isopropanol permeated through latex and vinyl gloves in less than 10 min. The polyethylene (PE) gloves were of quite variable quality, and the breakthrough time ranged from 4 to greater than 240 min. The latex and vinyl gloves were also permeated by ethanol, but at a much lower rate. The disinfectants Blifacid, based on p-chloro-m-cresol, and Cidex, based on glutaraldehyde, did not permeate any of the gloves tested within 60 min. Isopropanol had a destructive effect on the material, which became opaque, stiff and brittle. This change in structure was verified with the scanning electron microscope. The tested gloves of latex, vinyl and PE, gave acceptable protection from contact with Blifacid and Cidex for at least 60 min. The same gloves do not give any total protection from contact with isopropanol and ethanol.
