A collaborative study to determine the precision of the 1987 Method of test for the antimicrobial activity of disinfectants in food hygiene is described. The repeatability and reproducibility of the test was found to vary according to the nature of the test organism, the type of disinfectant product and the skill of the operator. Results indicate that significant differences in microbicidal effect (ME values) occur within test laboratories between test periods as well as between laboratories, and that much of this variability derives from apparently random variations in the resistance of test strains from day to day and test period to test period. Indications are that although the test is sufficiently reliable to be used as a standard method, adequate test replication must be specified to distinguish borderline pass from borderline fail disinfectant concentrations. The implications of the results in relation to current work on the development of unified European test methods for disinfectants is discussed.
