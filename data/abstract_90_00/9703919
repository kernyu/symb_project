IPCAR is a pyrazole nucleoside analog which belongs to a class of compounds structurally related to the inosine monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitors ribavirin, selenazofurin and tiazofurin. Unlike other anticancer drugs, IPCAR showed a potent and broad-spectrum antiproliferative activity in vitro coupled with low cytotoxicity for resting PBL and CFU-GM. IPCAR proved fully inhibitory against human nasopharyngeal carcinoma KB cells expressing the MDR phenotype, whereas IPCAR-resistant renal adenocarcinoma ACHN/R1 cells were fully susceptible to inhibition by a number of anticancer drugs, with the exception of 6TG, 6MP and 5FU towards which they showed a partial cross-resistance. In combinations studies, IPCAR proved synergistic with 6MP, 6TG, 5FU and ribavirin, and additive with ara-A, MTX, doxorubicin, taxol and tiazofurin. Antagonistic effects were never observed. Although the precise molecular target of IPCAR remains to be identified, the data presented herein suggest that, unlike ribavirin and tiazofurin, this drug inhibits a step of the de novo purine biosynthesis different from the conversion of IMP into GMP. In vivo, IPCAR showed low acute toxicity (DL10 > 1000 mg/kg) and was active against the L1210 murine lymphocytic leukemia model. Drug doses of 125 and 250 mg/kg on a day-1, -3 and -5 dosing schedule increased the life span (ILS) relative to untreated control mice of 36.4 and 68.2%, respectively, whereas administration of 500 mg/kg on days 1 and 3 resulted in a ILS of 86.4% and also increased the 30-day survival rate (25% of the mice).
