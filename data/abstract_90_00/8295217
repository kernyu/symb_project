The outstanding limitations to the oligopeptide as a therapeutic agent are poor oral availability and rapid biliary clearance. To address these concerns a series of eight peptidic HIV-1 protease inhibitors containing the structural segment of the vitamin biotin have been prepared. These have been evaluated with regard to the hypothesis that this vitamin would cloak the peptidic character of these oligopeptides, and thus impart to these inhibitors the potential for absorption and distribution via biotin transporters and receptors. By iterative optimization about a -Cha psi[CH-(OH)CH(OH)]Val- core inhibitory insert, three particularly potent inhibitors (K(i) < or = 10 nM) of the HIV-1 protease were obtained. Although excellent cell culture antiviral activity is observed for other peptidic protease inhibitors of comparable affinity, none in this series exhibited satisfactory antiviral activity. This failure is attributed to the incompatibility of the hydrophilic and hydrogen-bonding biotin segment, with the facile membrane permeability and intracellular access presumably required for antiviral activity. The ability of the biotin to cloak the peptide, and thus render the overall appearance of the conjugate as that of a vitamin, was evaluated. Four of this series were evaluated for recognition by the Caco-2 cell intestinal biotin transporter. None inhibited competitively biotin uptake, indicating a lack of recognition. A vitamin may bind to a specific protein carrier, and thus attain an improved serum profile (by resistance to biliary clearance) and advantageous delivery to cells. Therefore, the serum concentrations of three were evaluated following an iv bolus in a rat model for serum clearance. One of the three protease inhibitors (L-idonamide, 6-cyclohexyl-2,5,6-trideoxy-2-(1-methylethyl)-5-[[3-methyl-1-oxo-2-[[5- (hexahydro-2-oxo-1H-thieno[3,4-d]imidazol-4-yl)-1- oxopentyl]amino]butyl]amino]-N-[2-methyl-1-[[(2- pyridinylmethyl)amino]carbonyl]butyl]-, [3aS-[3a alpha, 4 beta (1R*,2R*,3R*),6 alpha]]-) sustained a more than 5-fold increase in serum concentration at all time points relative to the benchmark structure. The remaining two had serum concentrations at least equal to the benchmark, suggestive of improved resistance to clearance. One (L-idonamide,6-cyclohexyl-2,5,6-trideoxy-5-[[2-[[5-(hexahydro-2-ox o-1H- thieno-[3,4-d]imidazol-4-yl)pentyl]thio]benzoyl]amino]-2-(1- methylethyl)-N-[2-methyl-1-[[(2-pyridinyl- methyl)amino]carbonyl]butyl]-, [3aS-[3a alpha, 4 beta(1R*,2R*),6a alpha]]-) was prepared as a complex with the biotin-binding protein avidin. Avidin may resemble an endogenous serum biotin carrier protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
