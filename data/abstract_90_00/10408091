In Escherichia coli, dihydrofolate reductase is required for both the de novo synthesis of tetrahydrofolate and the recycling of dihydrofolate produced during the synthesis of thymidylate. The coding region of the dihydrofolate reductase gene, folA, was replaced with a kanamycin resistance determinant. Unlike earlier deletions, this mutation did not disrupt flanking genes. When the mutation was transferred into a wild-type strain and a thymidine-(thy) requiring strain, the resulting strains were viable but slow growing on rich medium. Both synthesized less folate than their parents, as judged by the incorporation of radioactive para-aminobenzoic acid. The derivative of the wild-type strain did not grow on any defined minimal media tested. In contrast, the derivative of the thy-requiring strain grew slowly on minimal medium with thy but exhibited auxotrophies on some combinations of supplements. These results suggest that when folates are limited, they can be distributed appropriately to folate-dependent biosynthetic reactions only under some conditions.
