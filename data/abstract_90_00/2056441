7-Aminoalkoxy-1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinoline-3- carboxylic acid and their derivatives were synthesized and their antibacterial activities were evaluated. Among them, compounds having an alkyl group at alpha-position of the amino group were found to have in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity comparable to that of ciprofloxacin. Structure-activity relationship of these compounds was also stated.
