Control of Helminthosporium solani, the cause of silver scurf in potato tubers, has been impaired by selection of benzimidazole-resistant strains as a result of repeated use of the fungicide thiabendazole. Identification of thiabendazole-resistant strains of H. solani by conventional techniques takes several weeks. Primers designed from conserved regions of the fungal beta-tubulin gene were used to PCR amplify and sequence a portion of the gene. A point mutation was detected at codon 198 in thiabendazole-resistant isolates causing a change in the amino acid sequence from glutamic acid to alanine or glutamine. Species-specific PCR primers designed to amplify this region were used in conjunction with a restriction endonuclease to cause cleavage in sensitive isolates only and thus provide a rapid diagnostic test to differentiate field isolates.
