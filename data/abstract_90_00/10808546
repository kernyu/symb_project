Cytotoxic and mitogenic activities of human and rabbit defensines (HNP and NP-2, resp.) and pig antimicrobial peptides from leukocytes (PR-39, prophenin PF-2 and protegrin PG-2) were studied. The above peptides were added to serum-free cell culture medium of the target cell lines K562, L929 and Hep22a. Cytotoxicity was estimated within 1, 3, 6, 24 and 48 h of cell incubation with the tested peptides in concentrations 1, 10, 25 or 100 micrograms/ml. All the examined peptides exhibited a distinct time- and concentration-dependent cytotoxicity. Moreover, by contrast to pig peptides, defensines could induce proliferation in cell subpopulations from cell lines L929 amd Hep22a, or L929 (defensines HNP and NP-2, resp.), keeping resistance to their cytotoxic action.
