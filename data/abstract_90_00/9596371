A rare case of recurrent mastoiditis is described with abscess formation caused by a nontuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) Mycobacterium chelonae abscessus. The exceptionally slow wound healing after repeated surgical debridement was striking. A literature study showed that in contrast with NTM infections of other parts of the body, infections of the middle ear were most commonly seen in immunocompetent children. If a case of chronic unilateral otitis media shows insufficient response to antibiotic therapy and surgical debridement, mycobacterial infection should be considered. The case described below illustrates the importance of histopathological and microbiological investigations.
