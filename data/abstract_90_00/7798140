NAD- and glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase (GD-FALDH) of Paracoccus denitrificans has been purified as a tetramer with a relative molecular mass of 150 kDa. The gene encoding GD-FALDH (flhA) has been isolated, sequenced, and mutated by insertion of a kanamycin resistance gene. The mutant strain is not able to grow on methanol, methylamine, or choline, while heterotrophic growth is not influenced by the mutation. This finding indicates that GD-FALDH of P. denitrificans is essential for the oxidation of formaldehyde produced during methylotrophic growth.
