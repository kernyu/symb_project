Earlier, we have shown that the overexpression of an ABC transporter, CDR1, is involved in the emergence of multidrug resistance in Candida albicans. In this study, we checked its function in vivo by expressing it in different isogenic Saccharomyces cerevisiae erg mutants, which accumulated various intermediates of the ergosterol biosynthesis and thus altered the membrane fluidity. Functions like the accumulation of rhodamine 123, beta-estradiol, fluconazole and floppase activity associated with Cdr1p were measured to ascertain their responses to an altered membrane phase. The floppase activity appeared to be favoured by an enhanced membrane fluidity, while the effluxing of substrates and Cdr1p's ability to confer multidrug resistance were significantly reduced. We demonstrate that only some of the functions of Cdr1p were affected by an altered lipid environment.
