Oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) may be instrumental in the development of atherosclerosis. We have examined the effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors captopril and quinaprilat and the -SH containing compound N-acetylcysteine on LDL oxidation. Oxidation of isolated human LDL was initiated with CuCl2. Conjugated diene formation (monitored spectrophotometrically at 234 nm) gave a measure of LDL oxidation. Captopril inhibited LDL oxidation but quinaprilat did not. The lag phase to the rapid increase in absorbance at 234 nm determined was 109 (65-157) min median and range for control samples and rose to 209 (168-305) min with captopril 10 microM, a ratio of 2.1:1 for drug to control (P = 0.01). N-acetylcysteine had a similar effect to captopril (drug to control lag time ratio 2.0:1, with NAC 10 microM), i.e. suggesting resistance to oxidation was due to the -SH group of both drugs. Captopril may have a potentially anti-atherosclerotic property not shared by other ACE inhibitors.
