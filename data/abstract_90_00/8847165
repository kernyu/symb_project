There are three areas in which Australian scientists have made outstanding contributions to the study of the chemotherapy of human parasitic infections. Naturally occurring products of plants have great potential as antiparasitic agents and although several native species have been shown to have antimalarial and anthelmintic activity, their potential as chemotherapeutic agents has not been fully realised; secondly, the demands of war ensured that the Army Malaria Unit at Cairns carried out meticulous and exceptional studies to evaluate new antimalarial compounds. Not only were they able to prove the effectiveness of atebrin, Proguanil and chloroquine as prophylactics, they also obtained much new information on the pharmacokinetics of antimalarials and about the infection itself. Full recognition of these pioneering studies involving over 1000 volunteers infected with malaria, which can never be repeated, has not been appreciated. The third significant contribution is the molecular studies on the mechanisms of drug resistance Plasmodium falciparum of both the antifolate- and quinoline-containing drugs and the identification and subsequent biochemical and molecular analysis of drug resistance in Giardia intestinalis infections.
