Activity of four fluoroquinolones i.e. ofloxacin, enoxacin, pefloxacin and ciprofloxacin was studied on a model of purulent meningoencephalitis caused by intracerebral contamination of mice with P. aeruginosa. 900 mice were involved in the experiment. Ofloxacin and enoxacin were administered per os and pefloxacin and ciprofloxacin were injected subcutaneously. Ofloxacin, pefloxacin and ciprofloxacin were shown to be highly active. Enoxacin showed a low activity. ++Non-fluorinated quinolones were inactive in the model. The activity of the fluoroquinolones was compared with that of gentamicin and dioxidine.
