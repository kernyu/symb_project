A two step simple procedure for antibody stabilization in soluble form was developed. The antibody is first treated with low molecular weight polyaldehyde (polyglutaraldehyde). Following removal of non-bound polyaldehyde the antibody-polyaldehyde conjugate is crosslinked by polyamine (alkyl amine derivative of polyglutaraldehyde). Feasibility studies were successfully conducted employing monoclonal antibody raised against horseradish peroxidase as model system. The stabilized antibody preparation exhibited improved thermal stability, enhanced resistance to proteolytic digestion and higher 'specific binding activity' in ELISA test, without losing its capability to bind large antigen (enzyme) or being recognized by another antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG).
