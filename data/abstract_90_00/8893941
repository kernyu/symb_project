Pyomyositis, purportedly a common tropical infection affecting mainly healthy adults and children, appears to be most uncommon in this region. We report a case of pyomyositis caused by a Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in a previously healthy army officer. This case serves to illustrate the difficulty in recognising this disease entity, which is why many cases may have been missed. With the increasing incidence of MRSA nosocomial infections, the emergence of MRSA in a hitherto community-acquired infection poses a major concern especially since intravenous drug abuse and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) are on the rise in our country. We hope to inculcate greater awareness of this infection.
