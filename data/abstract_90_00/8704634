We found that essential, tocopherol acetate, and lidocaine hydrochloride enhance the immune response to T-dependent antigen under active physical loading. Essential induces the appearance of immunostimulating properties in heavy erythrocytes whereas tocopherol acetate, and lidocaine hydrochloride increase the resistance of light erythrocytes to the effect of blood serum compounds (extracted from swimming animals) which induce the immunosuppressive properties in them.
