Cefprozil (CFPZ), a newly developed cephalosporin in fine granular form, was administered to pediatric patients with skin and soft tissue infections. MICs were determined for 6 drugs including CFPZ, cephalexin (CEX), cefaclor (CCL), ampicillin (ABPC), methicillin (DMPPC), cloxacillin (MCIPC) against 53 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus from these patients. An inoculum size of 10(6) CFU/ml was used in the MIC-determinations. CFPZ was given to 73 patients with ages ranging from 6 months to 10 years and 8 months and 71 cases were evaluable for clinical effects as follows; impetigo (65), Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (1), furuncle (1), subcutaneous abscess (3), and periproctal abscess (1). To study clinical efficacy, bacteriological effects and safety of this drug, a mean dose of 8.4 mg/kg with 3-4 daily dosages (57 cases of t.i.d. and 14 cases of q.i.d.) was administered for an average of 6 days. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. With regard to the 53 isolates of S. aureus, MICs of CFPZ against 52 strains (98.1%) ranged from 0.78 to 3.13 micrograms/ml. 45 strains (84.9%) were inhibited at 0.78 micrograms/ml. MIC90 of CFPZ was 1.56 micrograms/ml, but MIC against 1 strain of Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was 100 micrograms/ml. The MIC90 of CEX and CCL were 6.25 micrograms/ml and MIC of CEX and CCL against 1 MRSA strain were 200 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 of ABPC, DMPPC and MCIPC were 6.25, 3.13 and 0.39 micrograms/ml, respectively. CFPZ showed the second highest activity after MCIPC against S. aureus. 2. CFPZ showed very good clinical responses and clinical effects in 71 patients all of whom judged by doctors in charge as having "good" or better responses. 3. For impetigo patients, the evaluable cases by score 3, 5 and 7 days after administration of the drug were 52, 39 and 20 patients, respectively. The efficacy rates on these days were 90.4, 100 and 100%, respectively. The efficacy rate at a daily dose of 30.1-45.0 mg/kg on day 3 was 17.2% higher than that at 22.5-30.0 mg/kg, and the "excellent" response rate of 30.1-45.0 mg/kg group was 45.3% greater. Because of these results, it is expected that good clinical effects can be obtained at a daily dose of 22.5-30.0 mg/kg of CFPZ, but better responses can be expected at 30.1-45.0 mg/kg in 3-4 divided doses given for 5 days. 4. Bacteriological effects of CFPZ were determined against 60 strains of S. aureus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
