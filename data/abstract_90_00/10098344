Ten of 12 strains of Mycobacteria (11 M. tuberculosis, 1 M. bovis) including 7 resistant strains were found to be sensitive to tetradecyl-dimethyl-benzyl-ammonium fluoride (TDBAF) at a concentration of 15-7.75 micrograms/ml (end point 10 micrograms/ml). A single multi-resistant strain of M. tuberculosis and a culture of M. bovis were also sensitive but at a slightly higher level.
