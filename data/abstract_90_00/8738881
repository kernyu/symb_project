To determine whether lysylbradykinin (LBK, kallidin) causes bronchoconstriction in animals and if peptidase inhibitors modulate the response, we studied the effects of LBK administered by aerosol in rats and assessed whether pretreatment with aerosolized solutions of enalaprilat, an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), or phosphoramidon, an inhibitor of endopeptidase 24.11 (EP 24.11, neutral endopeptidase), altered the response. Accordingly, LBK-induced bronchoconstriction was measured in anesthetized, mechanically ventilated, specific pathogen-free, Sprague-Dawley rats by body plethysmography and followed by continuous determination of lung resistance (RL) and maximal expiratory flow (MEF). Incremental doses of aerosolized LBK were administered by nebulization to obtain a concentration that caused a 5-15% increase in RL, which was designated the BC10 dose. We found that pretreatment with aerosolized enalaprilat (1 mM) 3 min prior to a BC10 dose of LBK significantly increased RL as compared to the BC10 dose alone (129 +/- 4.1% vs. 105 +/- 2.4%, P < 0.002, n = 4) and significantly decreased MEF (83 +/- 1.5% vs. 97 +/- 1.4%, P < 0.008, n = 4). Following pretreatment with aerosolized phosphoramidon (1 mM), significant increases in RL (113 +/- 1.4% vs. 106 +/- 1.6%, P < 0.019, n = 7) and decreases in MEF (92 +/- 0.9% vs. 95 +/- 0.9%, P < 0.035, n = 7) were observed (paired Student's t-test). The above findings demonstrate the effects of LBK on airway caliber for the first time in an animal model, and suggest that ACE and EP 24.11 contribute to degradation of the peptide in the airway.
