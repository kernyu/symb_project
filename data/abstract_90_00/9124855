Emergence of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia as a nosocomial pathogen is becoming increasingly apparent. Pleiotropic resistance characterizes S. maltophilia. Furthermore, a slow growth rate and an increased mutation rate generate discordance between in vitro susceptibility testing and clinical outcome. Despite original susceptibility, drug-resistant strains of S. maltophilia are often recovered from patients receiving beta-lactams, quinolones, or aminoglycosides. Given the disparity among various in vitro susceptibility methods, this study incorporated a unique pharmacodynamic model to more accurately characterize the bacterial time-kill curves and mutation rates of four clinical isolates of S. maltophilia following exposure to simulated multidose regimens of ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and ticarcillin-clavulanate. Time-kill data demonstrated regrowth of S. maltophilia with all four agents. With the exception of ticarcillin-clavulanate, viable bacterial counts at the end of 24 h exceeded the starting inoculum. Ciprofloxacin only reduced bacterial counts by less than 1.0 log prior to rapid bacterial regrowth. Resistant mutant strains, identical to their parent strain by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, were observed following exposure to each class of antibiotic. Mutant strains also had distinct susceptibility patterns. These data are consistent with previous reports which suggest that S. maltophilia, despite susceptibility data that imply that the organism is sensitive, develops multiple forms of resistance quickly and against several classes of antimicrobial agents. Standard in vitro susceptibility methods are not completely reliable for detecting resistant S. maltophilia strains; and therefore, interpretation of these results should be done with caution. In vivo studies are needed to determine optimal therapy against S. maltophilia infections.
