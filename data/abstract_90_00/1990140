Of 166 strains of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from hospital patients and staff in Ile-Ife, Nigeria, 32% were non-typable (NT). The strains were isolated from skin lesions, eye infections, wounds and nasal flora. Isolates from skin lesions or eye and wound infections were more likely to produce protease (95% and 78% respectively) than nasal isolates (11%). Nearly all (99%) of the strains isolated were resistant to penicillin and 78% were resistant to tetracycline. Streptomycin resistance occurred in 25% of isolates; 19% were resistant to chloramphenicol and 9% to methicillin.
