The ermA, ermB, ermC and msrA/msrB genes were detected in multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus spp. strains by PCR. Among 25 human clinical staphylococcal isolates the ermA, ermB, ermC and the msrA/msrB genes were detected in 88, 72, 4 and 100% of the strains, respectively. Among 24 poultry isolates the ermA, ermB, ermC and the msrA/msrB genes were detected in 100, 16.6, 50 and 12.5% of the strains, respectively. The ermA gene was found exclusively on the chromosome, whereas the ermC gene was found on 2.4-4.2 kb plasmids. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the ermA gene with Eco RI revealed five patterns (25.0, 21.0, 10.5, 6.2 and 4. 8 kb) for the clinical strains and two (8.0 and 6.2 kb) for the poultry strains. The 6.2 kb RFLP pattern, in both the poultry and human clinical isolates, indicates a common lineage for the ermA gene.
