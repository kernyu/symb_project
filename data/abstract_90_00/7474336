A comparison was made for frequencies of isolation o glucose non-fermentative Gram-negative rods ((G)NF-GNR) from clinical specimens during a period from July, 1986 to June, 1987 (the first period) and that from January, 1994 to December, 1994 (the second period). Also, minimum inhibitory concentrations of principal drugs were determined against these isolates. The obtained results are summarized as follows: 1. Thirty four (34) species of (G)NF-GNR were found from 35,200 clinical specimens in the two periods. Numbers of strains of (G)NF-GNR obtained were 4,575 during the first period and 4,704 during the second period, thus no significant difference existed in numbers of strains isolated in the two periods. 2. Among the 34 species to which the 4,704 strains were classified into, Pseudomonas aeruginosa comprised 68.4%, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia 6.9%, Acinetobacter baumannii 5.6%, Burkholderia cepacia 3.1%, Acinetobacter Iwoffii 2.6%, Alcaligenes xylosoxidans subsp. xylosoxidans 2.4%, Flavobacterium indologenes 1.7%, Pseudomonas putida 1.1%, Acinetobacter junii 1.1% and Moraxella subgenus Moraxella lacunata 0.9%. When these frequencies of isolation were compared with those in the first period, it was found that B. cepacia decreased significantly (P < 0.01) and that S. maltophilia increased significantly (P < 0.001). 3. MIC determinations revealed multiple drug resistance strains in many different species of bacteria. Minocycline, however, were active against many such strains, and ofloxacin was found to have strong antibacterial activity against some strains.
