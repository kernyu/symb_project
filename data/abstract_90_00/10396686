Antimicrobial activities of oral beta-lactam antimicrobial agents against clinically isolated 131 strains of Haemophilus influenzae were studied. The peak of MICs of ampicillin (ABPC) was 0.20 microgram/ml. Those of cefaclor (CCL), cefotiam (CTM), cefteram (CFTM), cefpodoxime (CPDX), cefdinir (CFDN), cefditoren (CDTR), cefcapene (CFPN), and faropenem (FRPM) were 1.56, 0.39, 0.013, 0.05, 0.20, 0.013, 0.013, and 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. The antimicrobial activities of CFTM, CDTR and CFPN were superior to those of others. There was 74.8% of ABPC-sensitive strains, of which the MICs were below 0.78 microgram/ml. The percentages of beta-lactamase-positive strains and beta-lactamase-negative ABPC-resistant H. influenzae (BLNAR) were 14.5% and 14%, respectively.
