Granulysin is a novel antimicrobial protein produced by human cytolytic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. It is active against a broad range of microbes, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and parasites. The fact that it kills Mycobacterium tuberculosis is particularly important, since the current vaccine (Bacille Calmette-Guerin, BCG) is of limited efficacy and antibiotic resistance is increasing. Although functionally related to other antibacterial peptides, defensins and magainins, granulysin is structurally distinct. Like porcine NK lysin and amoebapores made by Entamoeba histolytica, granulysin is related to saposins, small lipid-associated proteins present in the central nervous system. The identification of this novel molecule indicates a broader and perhaps more significant role for T lymphocytes in both innate and acquired antimicrobial defenses.
