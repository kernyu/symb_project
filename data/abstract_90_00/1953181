Genetic determinants of tetracycline resistance of classes A, B and C were detected with DNA probes labeled with radioactive phosphorus (32P) in Shigella (44 strains) and Salmonella (50 strains). It was shown that in the Shigella strains the frequency of the Tet A gene amounted to 66 per cent, the frequency of the Tet B gene was equal to 84 per cent, the frequency of their combination was equal to 50 per cent and the frequency of the Tet C gene was nil. In the Salmonella strains the frequency of the Tet A, Tet B and Tet C genes was equal to 0.100 and 20 per cent, respectively, and that of their combination amounted to 20%. Possible use of the DNA probes in epidemiological analysis of outbreaks of Shigella and Salmonella infections is suggested.
