A simple screening method for fluconazole susceptibility of Cryptococcus neoformans using 2% dextrose Sabouraud dextrose agar (SabDex) with fluconazole was compared to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) broth macrodilution method. By this method, fluconazole-susceptible C. neoformans isolates are significantly smaller on medium with fluconazole than on fluconazole-free medium. Isolates with decreased susceptibility have normal-size colonies on medium containing fluconazole. The 48-h NCCLS broth macrodilution MICs (NCCLS MICs) for isolates with normal-size colonies on 8- or 16-microg/ml fluconazole plates were predicted to be > or =8 or > or =16 microg/ml, respectively. On medium with 16 microg of fluconazole per ml, all strains (84 of 84) for which the NCCLS MICs were <16 microg/ml were correctly predicted, as were all isolates (7 of 7) for which the MICs were > or =16 microg/ml. Agar dilution appears to be an effective screening method for fluconazole resistance in C. neoformans.
