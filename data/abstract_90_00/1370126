Some interferon (IFN)-regulated genes are induced as a primary response to virus as well as secondarily through virus-induced IFN. Here we investigated whether this dual control mechanism would also regulate the activity of the human and mouse Mx genes that encode proteins with intrinsic antiviral potentials. To distinguish between a primary response to virus and a secondary response to virus-induced IFN, we studied virus-induced Mx gene expression in cell lines that lack a functional IFN system and in cells with blocked protein synthesis. In contrast to the two IFN-regulated human genes ISG56 and ISG15, the human MxA gene showed almost no primary response to Newcastle disease virus (NDV) or influenza virus. Similarly, direct activation of the mouse Mx1 gene by NDV or influenza virus was not significant in mouse embryo cells or explanted peritoneal macrophages. A moderate primary Mx1 response to NDV was observed in the permanent cell line L1210. Lack of a strong IFN-independent Mx response to virus indicates that this mode of gene regulation does not play a significant role in Mx-mediated resistance to viral disease.
