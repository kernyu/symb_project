The hybrid hybridomas (tetradomas) were produced from the fusion of the double mutant actinomycin Dr (ADr)/HATs hybridoma to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and wild type hybridoma to alpha-endorphin (EP). The double mutant phenotype was constructed using the new strategy, based on the fusion of immune mouse splenocytes with mouse myeloma (X63.Ag8, 653) cell variants, made resistant to 30 ng/ml of AD by stepwise selection. This allowed the direct introduction of the dominant selective marker (ADr) into the hybrid cells. Tetradomas secreted the bispecific monoclonal antibodies (bi Mabs), simultaneously binding to EP and HRP in double antigen ELISA, the ELISA plates covered with EP-bovine serum albumin conjugate. Using rat pituitary the bi Mabs were shown to be effective for immunostaining of EP-producing cells. EP-producing cells.
