A microdilution antifungal susceptibility test for yeasts was evaluated, based on the macro broth dilution method standardized by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) Subcommittee on Antifungal Susceptibility Testing. Both methods were compared using six reference strains with different patterns of susceptibility to the following antifungal drugs: amphotericin B (AMB), flucytosine (5FC), fluconazole (FCZ), itraconazole (ITZ), ketoconazole (KTZ) and miconazole (MCZ). Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) results obtained by both methods differed only in 1 or 2 dilutions. Microdilution MIC's determined as visual endpoints and as quantitative measurement of 80% inhibition of relative growth showed a significant correlation (p < 0.001) for AMB, 5FC, FCZ, MCZ and ITZ, conversely no correlation (p = 1.00) for KTZ was observed as determined with 47 local isolates of Candida albicans.
