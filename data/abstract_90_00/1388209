The nonstructural (NS) transcription unit of minute virus of mice (MVMp) encodes proteins that are involved in viral DNA replication and in the regulation of homologous and heterologous promoters. Moreover, it has been shown that NS-protein accumulation is toxic for transformed cells. With the aim of identifying the NS-protein function(s) responsible for cytotoxicity, point mutations and deletions were introduced in the NS-protein-coding sequence of MVMp. This strategy indicated that in transformed human NBE cells, the NS-1 protein is indispensable for MVMp DNA replication, trans activation of the late parvoviral promoter P38, trans inhibition of the long terminal repeat promoter of the Rous sarcoma virus, and cytotoxicity. Moreover, some mutations led to the dissociation of the replicative and regulatory functions of the NS-1 protein and showed that cytotoxicity correlated with the latter, more particularly with the capacity to trans inhibit the heterologous promoter. The NS-1 sequences required for cytotoxicity were found to be restricted to the amino- and carboxy-terminal portions of the protein. Although the cytotoxicities of NS-1 extremities were weak when the extremities were tested separately, the cytotoxicities were comparable to that of the full protein when the extremities were fused. Interestingly, an overall negative charge can be predicted from the NS-1 sequence over about 100 amino acids at both ends. The conservation of this charge distribution among the NS proteins of different parvoviruses suggests that NS-1 may bear some similarities to acidic transcriptional activators.
