Beta-lactam susceptibility and beta-lactamase patterns of a random sample of 44 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains that had been isolated from nosocomial infections at Dokuz Eylul University Hospital in Izmir, were investigated. All strains were amoxycillin resistant but in the presence of clavulanic acid 26 became sensitive. Similarly 39 of the strains were resistant to ceftazidime and cefotaxime; clavulanic acid restored sensitivity to ceftazidime in 28 and to cefotaxime in 25 of these resistant strains. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production was positive in 84% of the isolates as determined by the double disk synergy test. Isoelectric focusing revealed that each strain produced one to four beta-lactamases, pI 7.6 enzymes being the most prevalent. Other enzymes with pIs of 8.4, 8.2, 5.4, 7.8 were also detected. Resistance to ceftazidime was transferred from 18 of the 44 isolates to the recipient Escherichia coli K-12 at 37 degrees C. The transconjugants were examined for their plasmid content and the plasmids were characterized by their size and resistance profile. Fourteen different restriction pattern groups were identified with Eco R1. The results indicate a high prevalence of ESBL production in nosocomial K. pneumoniae isolates in Izmir and have major implications concerning the clinical use of later generation cephalosporins.
