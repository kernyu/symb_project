Lipopeptide L-733,560 is a water-soluble derivative of pneumocandin B0 that exhibits enhanced anti-Candida activity. We investigated the in vitro activity of L-733,560 compared with those of amphotericin B, flucytosine, and itraconazole, against fluconazole-resistant (n = 44) and fluconazole-susceptible (n = 46) Candida albicans isolates. Tests were performed with a photometer-read broth microdilution method with RPMI-2% glucose and National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards reference strains. Except for those of itraconazole, MICs were not significantly different between the two groups of isolates, as expected for agents with different mechanisms of action. L-733,560 was the most active agent against C.albicans, with MICs for 50 and 90% of the strains tested of 0.01 and 0.06 microgram/ml, respectively.
