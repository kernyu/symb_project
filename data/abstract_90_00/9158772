Scarce information is available on the real mechanism by which carbapenemes penetrate in Enterobacteriaceae, although a considerable amount of evidence suggests that in many species of this family the lack of certain outer membrane proteins is associated with the acquisition of resistance to these antibiotics. The existance of specific pathways for the carbapenems has never been demonstrated, although at times it has been postulated in both wild and mutant strains, on the basis of evident discordances between permeability patterns and suceptibility data. By using the Zimmerman and Rosselet technique, which requires the strain under investigation to harbor a suitable beta-lactamase, the permeability of intact Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae cells to meropenem and imipenem was investigated by transferring a constructed vector carrying the carbapenem hydrolyzing CphA metallo-beta-lactamase gene into the parental strains and their porin-deficient mutants. Reduced amounts of nonspecific porins significantly reduced the penetration of both carbapenems. The virtual absence of porins caused the MICs of meropenem to increase, mostly in Enterobacter cloacae, while it did not affected the MICs of imipenem. No evidence of specific porin pathways of the type described in Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found.
