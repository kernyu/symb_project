Crude extracts from 115 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were analyzed biochemically. The TEM-3 type was encountered 108 times, SHV types were encountered 7 times, and the TEM-26 type was encountered only once. For the last one, the gene was identified; an adenine was detected at position 925, as in blaTEM-26B not in blaTEM-26.
