Mutants resistant to 3-aminobenzamide, a known inhibitor of ADP-ribosyltransferase, were obtained from Streptomyces griseus IFO 13189, a streptomycin-producing strain. One (strain no. 4), which had significantly reduced ADP-ribosyltransferase activity, was analysed in detail. Mutant 4 displayed a conditional phenotype with respect to cultivation temperature. At 30 degrees C, it exhibited severely reduced ability to produce aerial mycelium (on solid medium) and submerged spores and streptomycin (in liquid culture), but this ability was fully restored at 25 degrees C. The mutant produced A-factor normally, regardless of cultivation temperature, and exhibited normal ability to accumulate ppGpp intracellularly. SDS-PAGE analyses of cellular proteins labelled by [32P]NAD revealed that an ADP-ribosylated protein with a molecular size of 44 kDa, which appeared in sporulating cultures of the parent strain, was missing from the mutant grown at the non-permissive temperature (30 degrees C). Genetic analysis showed that the aba mutation conferring resistance to 3-aminobenzamide was tightly linked to the altered phenotype. Failure to ADP-ribosylate certain cellular protein(s), presumably due to the aba mutation, may be responsible for impaired differentiation in this mutant.
