The potential role of quinolones is discussed on the basis of data obtained during the past 2 years from epidemiological studies, in vitro investigations, animal experiments and clinical trials. Although the newest compounds exhibit good activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae and intracellular pathogens in animal models, the role of quinolones as first line therapy in community-acquired pneumonia is still debatable and may be modified according to clinical presentation and the rate of resistance of pneumococci to beta-lactams and macrolides. Cost-utility and cost-benefit studies are required to delineate precisely the role of quinolones in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. In addition, promising results indicating a possible future for the clinical use of quinolones in the therapy of mycobacterial infections have been obtained.
