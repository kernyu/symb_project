Y. pestis, the causative agents of plague, have been found to be incapable of using heme iron bound to haptoglobin and hemopexin complexes in human blood and blood serum, and protein components of the serum are not the factors inhibiting this process. At the same time iron of free hemoglobin can be successfully utilized by Y. pestis in the systems used in this study. On the contrary, hemin not only produces any stimulating effect on the growth of Y. pestis in blood serum, but leads to the death of these bacteria [correction of lasteria].
