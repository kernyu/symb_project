A chronic dialysis patient developed persistent bacteremia as a result of infection with Enterococcus faecium. During the patient's illness, resistance to ampicillin, gentamicin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin developed. Despite arteriovenous (AV) graft removal and an extensive but inconclusive search for the source of the infection, bacteremia persisted. On autopsy, the patient was found to have had aortic-valve endocarditis. Endocarditis is a well-known complication in dialysis patients. Multidrug-resistant organisms are becoming more prevalent in hospitalized patients as well. Risk factors for the development of endocarditis in dialysis patients include catheters, AV grafts, and calcific valvular disease, all in conjunction with frequent access to the circulation. Avoidance of temporary catheter use by prompt placement of AV fistulas or grafts and consideration of their early use, the meticulous care of catheters once in place, and treatment of the nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus may lower the incidence of bacteremia and therefore endocarditis in dialysis patients. The removal of infected catheters and/or AV grafts if prompt clearing of the blood with antibiotics does not occur is the next step, followed by valve replacement in selected cases. The routine use of vancomycin in the dialysis population should be reevaluated in light of the development of high-level antibiotic-resistant organisms.
