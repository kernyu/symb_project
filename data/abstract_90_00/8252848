Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a bacterium that can colonize or infect people. MRSA strains are not more virulent than methicillin susceptible strains. Colonized and infected patients represent the most important reservoir of MRSA in hospitals. MRSA is transmitted by direct person-to-person contact, usually on the hands of health care workers. Limiting the spread of MRSA is desirable because the organism is resistant to oxacillin, nafcillin, cephalosporins, and imipenem. Treatment of choice for MRSA infection is usually intravenous vancomycin. The preferred methods for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of S. aureus include oxacillin-salt screening plates, microdilution broth tests with 2% NaCI, and disk diffusion tests incubated for 24 hours at 35 degrees C. Hospitals and LTCFs should monitor the incidence of nosocomial transmission of MRSA in their facility. Hospital admission because of MRSA infection is acceptable medical practice because treatment can best be accomplished in an acute care setting. However, given special circumstances, treatment of MRSA infection can be accomplished in an extended care facility or at home. This decision is based on the clinical judgement of the attending physician. Hospital admission solely because of MRSA colonization is unwarranted. MRSA colonization is not a contraindication to discharge from an acute care hospital to home or another facility. When a hospitalized patient who is colonized with MRSA no longer needs to receive acute nursing care (i.e. their MRSA infection and/or other acute medical problems are under control), they can be discharged. If they are discharged to another institution, that institution should be notified in advance that the patient is colonized with MRSA.
