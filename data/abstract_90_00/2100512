59 cases of Plasmodium falciparum malaria fever occurring in non-immune Caucasian subjects having got a correct chemoprophylaxis by chloroquine were treated by halofantrine (HALFAN). They were given 1500 mg divided in 3 doses of 500 mg every 6 hours from D1 to D8. All them were back from a malarial highly endemic zone with chloroquine resistance. Analysis of the main biological and clinical efficiency parameters displayed very satisfactory results: disappearances of fever (mean 22 H) and parasitemia (mean 36 H) are short. After two months of monitoring, no malaria recrudescence was noted. With an efficacy of 10 p.c. associated to a noticeable clinical and biological tolerance Halofantrine is a first-class treatment of chloroquine resistant malaria fever.
