In four areas with different types of atmospheric pollution 534 children of school age were examined for serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE), saliva IgA (sIgA), lysozymes (LYS) and acute phase reactants (alfa-l-antitrypsin - A1AT, alfa-2-macroglobulin -A2M, ceruloplasmin -CPL, transferrin - TRF). The children were divided into two groups: those with altered resistance (AR) comprising allergoses of all types and recurrent or persistent infections and those without the above health problems, i.e. healthy (H). There were more children with AR in areas with higher atmospheric pollution than in control areas. The frequency of AR was higher among boys than among girls. In the control area BN, a number of parameters in the AR group differed significantly from those in the H group. In areas with substantial atmospheric pollution these differences were generally less pronounced. Significant differences were found between the control and polluted areas in many indicators. In the area KO characterized by an intermediate degree of industrial pollution the means of the tested parameters were habitually elevated, whereas in the heavily polluted areas they were decreased. The most sensitive tests for evaluating differences between the areas were the levels of A1AT, LYS, and IgE, while the variations of sIgA, sLYS and CPL were less pronounced.
