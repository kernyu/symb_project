Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolated in Saudi Arabia and Great Britain were examined for susceptibility to antibiotics and biocides. The strains differed in their sensitivity patterns. None of the Saudi strains showed resistance to propamidine isethionate, but most of the British gentamicin methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus (GMRSA) strains were highly resistant to this compound and to some other nucleic acid-binding (NAB) compounds. Both groups showed a low level of resistance towards quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs), but resistance to these compounds was not associated with resistance to gentamicin in the Saudi strains. The aminoglycoside-resistant determinants were non-conjugative in these strains. Natural MRSA strains were good recipients for pWG613, but transferred this plasmid in reciprocal crosses at significantly lower rates.
