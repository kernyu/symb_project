Gram-positive isolates (n = 290) were tested for their susceptibility to three fluoroquinolone antibiotics by standard disk-diffusion technology. Overall, 59%, 72%, and 85% were susceptible and 29%, 25%, and 11% were resistant to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and trovafloxacin, respectively. Of Staphylococcus aureus isolates (n = 84), 55%, 57%, and 88% were susceptible to the three antibiotics, respectively. Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 45), too, was more susceptible to trovafloxacin, although the differences were smaller (60%, 62%, and 78%). Of 35 Enterococcus faecalis isolates, 66% and 74% were susceptible to levofloxacin and trovafloxacin, respectively, but only 9% were susceptible to ciprofloxacin.
