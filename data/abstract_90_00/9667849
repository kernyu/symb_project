Antimicrobial agents active against multi-resistant Gram-positive bacteria are considered to be of major commercial potential. Commercially viable agents that have been included in recent successful trials include the streptogramins, novel glycopeptides, oxazolidinones and potent quinolones. Cationic peptides have generated much interest, but their utility as successful drug candidates remains questionable. Novel compound classes for possible exploitation include non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitors, inhibitors of lipid A biosynthesis and tRNA synthetase inhibitors.
