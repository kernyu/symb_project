The yeast pleiotropic (multiple drug) resistance gene PDR5 encodes a product with homology to a large number of membrane transport proteins including the mammalian multiple drug resistance family. In this study, we identified four genes on chromosome II that affect the steady-state level of PDR5 transcript in addition to a previously identified positive regulator, PDR1. The genes in question are PDR3, PDR4, PDR7 and PDR9. We also analyzed the interaction between PDR5 and YAP1. YAP1 encodes a positive regulator with a leucine zipper motif that causes pleiotropic drug resistance when overproduced. YAP1-mediated pleiotropic drug resistance is not dependent on the presence of PDR5 and must act through other genes.
