In vitro testing of 229 group B streptococcal isolates from a variety of patients with invasive infections indicated uniform penicillin G susceptibility. However, 17 (7.4%) isolates were resistant to erythromycin and 8 (3.4%) were resistant to clindamycin. These results support the continued use of penicillin G as the drug of choice for the treatment and prevention of group B streptococcal disease.
