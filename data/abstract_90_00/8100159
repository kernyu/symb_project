The present work was aimed at defining novel strategies to reverse chemoresistance to anticancer drugs, especially by interfering with cellular glutathione metabolism, peroxisomal and/or extraperoxisomal hydroperoxide metabolic pathways. Preliminary results are presented about molecules we demonstrated to be capable of interfering with hydrogen peroxide metabolism in cells. Prior to describing these molecules, a short overview of glutathione and free radical metabolic pathways is presented as well as a rapid presentation of the characteristics of chemo-sensitivity and -resistance towards the anticancer drug adriamycin, with special emphasis on hydrogen peroxide metabolism. The strategies currently developed to reverse chemoresistance are further presented in subsequent sections, our own strategy to achieve inhibition of hydrogen peroxide breakdown and stimulation of peroxisomal hydrogen peroxide production is illustrated on the basis of molecular modelling studies and biochemical investigations on extraperoxisomal and peroxisomal metabolic pathways. Preliminary studies on cultured cells have been initiated. The perspective for future studies is presented as well as other possible models of chemoresistance as target for the design of hydrogen peroxide metabolism-interfering pharmacomolecules.
