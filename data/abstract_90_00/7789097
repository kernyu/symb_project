Emerging resistance to the current fluoroquinolones has encouraged synthesis of new compounds in this class. We have evaluated the activity of DU-6859a, a novel halogenated quinolone, against a panel of 300 bacteria, relative to the activity of ciprofloxacin, clinafloxacin, fleroxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin, and sparfloxacin. DU-6859a was the most active of the fluoroquinolones studied and retains potentially useful activity against 80% of isolates resistant (minimum inhibitory concentration, > or = 4 micrograms/ml) to ciprofloxacin. Continued clinical investigation of DU-6859a and similar new quinolones is urged.
