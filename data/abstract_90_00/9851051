Germinated conidia of the thermophilic fungus Humicola grisea var. thermoidea were transformed to hygromycin B resistance using the plasmid pAN7.1. Transformation was achieved using lithium acetate treatment or electroporation. The efficiency of transformation was up to 32 and 25 transformants per microgram of plasmid DNA with the two methods, respectively. Transformants obtained by the lithium acetate method were more stable and showed a high copy number of the hph gene integrated into their genome. The other transformants, from the electroporation procedure, were stable, but unable to grow in the presence of high levels of hygromycin, and detection of the hph gene was only possible by polymerase chain reaction analysis.
