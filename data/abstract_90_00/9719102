Genes encoding trimethoprim (TMP)-resistant and -susceptible dihydrofolate reductases (DHFR) in Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated in Saitama Prefecture were compared with the TMP-resistant DHFR gene of S. aureus, dfrA. The nucleotide sequences of TMPr and TMPs genes in five S. epidermidis isolates tested could be divided into three types: type 1, identical with the TMPr gene dfrA that had been found in S. aureus; type 3, identical with the TMPs gene dfrC in S. epidermidis; and type 2, having only two nucleotide substitutions to dfrC with no amino acid change. TMPr isolates carried either one of the type 2 or type 3 sequences in addition to the type 1 sequence. A Southern hybridization analysis revealed that, in TMPr S. epidermidis, the type 1 sequence was located on a 5.5 kb EcoRI-EcoRV restriction fragment together with the sequence for the gentamicin (GM)-resistant gene, while the type 2 or type 3 sequence was located on the 1.0 kb EcoRI-EcoRV fragment. No plasmid-carrying dfrA-homologous sequence was detected in the S. epidermidis isolates we tested. These results suggest that the TMPr and GMr genes are closely linked and located on the chromosome in S. epidermidis isolated in Japan.
