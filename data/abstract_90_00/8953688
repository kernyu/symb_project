We report on a strain of Salmonella enteritidis which was found to be resistant to both ciprofloxacin and beta-lactams and chloramphenicol in a patient treated with ciprofloxacin for a splenic abscess. We conclude that in invasive infections such as a splenic abscess caused by Salmonella, early surgical intervention is important. Multiple-drug-resistant strains of Salmonella may be selected by treatment with ciprofloxacin alone.
