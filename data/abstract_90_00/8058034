Previous work has shown that two unlinked, partially homologous transgene loci can interact in plant nuclei, leading to reversible methylation and inactivation of one transgene locus in the presence of the second. To study whether the chromosomal location of a transgene influences its susceptibility to trans-inactivation, we retransformed four transgenic lines, which contained the same construct (H) integrated in different chromosomal locations, with a second, partially homologous construct (K). At least 50 double transformants (DTs) were regenerated from each single transformants (ST) and screened for inactivation of markers [chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT); hygromycin resistance (HYGR)] at the resident H locus. For two STs, H locus markers were inactivated in less than 1% of the DTs, suggesting that, at these integration sites, H was relatively resistant to trans-inactivation. In contrast, the other two STs appeared to be more sensitive to trans-inactivation: 4-10% of the DTs were CAT- and/or Hygs. Inactivation of H locus markers could be attributed to two distinct phenomena: 1. Regeneration from cells containing different epigenetic states of H, in which either both, one or none of the H alleles was active. This instability in the expression of the H locus, which was independent of K, was more pronounced in the homozygous state, and was associated with cellular mosaicism of expression and methylation. 2. The presence of an unlinked K locus could weaken the HygR phenotype by transcriptional inactivation and increased methylation of the hph gene at the H locus. These results indicated that a susceptible transgene locus is inherently unstable and partially methylated, and that these characteristics are exacerbated when the locus is homozygous for the transgene and/or when an unlinked homologous transgene is present.
