The checkerboard method was used to determine the antimicrobial activity of the combination cefotaxime/ofloxacin against 217 bacterial isolates involved in serious infections. Synergy or partial synergy was observed against 19 of 34 (55.8%) Staphylococcus aureus methicillin-susceptible isolates, 4 of 47 (8.4%) Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 28 of 34 (82.2%) Escherichia coli isolates and 70 of 102 (68.5%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. Antagonism was not observed with any of the isolates examined.
