The construction of a new retroviral vector, pSKV, is described. This vector carries two unique cloning sites, located between two Moloney leukemia virus-derived LTR, into which genes of interest may be introduced. The gene encoding hygromycin resistance (HyR) was subsequently introduced into one of the two sites, producing a second vector (pSKV/HyR) containing a unique SfiI site for the introduction of cDNA clones under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (P-CMV). The cDNA (mH13), encoding a protein that has been shown to serve as a murine ecotropic retroviral receptor in transient assays, was cloned into the SfiI site (pSKV/HyR/mH13). Both constructs can be packaged into retroviral particles following transfection into an appropriate packaging cell line. Stable transfectants of the human glioblastoma cell line (U118MG) carrying each of these two constructs were generated by transfection and subsequent Hy selection. Clones expressing both the selectable marker and the mH13 gene, but not those expressing only the selectable marker, are shown to be susceptible to infection with murine ecotropic retroviral particles. These cells (HyR and mH13 positive) were then exposed to CRE/Xtk culture supernatant, a packaging cell line producing ecotropic retroviral particles carrying the HSV-TK (Herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase) and neoR (neomycin-resistance) genes. Selection was in the presence of G418. In vitro growth of the U118MG/HyR/mH13/TK cells, but not that of the U118MG/HyR/mH13 cells, was inhibited by ganciclovir (GCV), indicating the successful transfer of HSV-TK by infection of human cells with murine retroviruses via the mH13 product.
