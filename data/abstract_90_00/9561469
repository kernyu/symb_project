The susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare to the disinfections used for spillage and heat sensitive instruments has received much attention in recent years. The use of clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis and M. avium-intracellulare as test organisms is considered unsuitable for standard tests due to their hazardous nature (category 3 pathogens and slow growth rates). This has led to much debate in standards committees on the selection and use of a possible surrogate which would be safer and more practical to use and yet mimic the susceptibility of clinical isolates. This study compared the susceptibility of one possible surrogate Mycobacterium terrae NCTC 10856, with that of clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis H37 Rv and M. avium-intracellulare using a quantitative suspension test. The instrument and environmental disinfectants tested were a chlorine-releasing agent, sodium dichloroisocyanyurate (NaDCC) at 1000 ppm and 10,000 ppm av. Cl, chlorine dioxide at 1100 ppm av. ClO2 (Tristel, HayMan MediChem), 0.35% peracetic acid (NuCidex, Johnson & Johnson), 70% industrial methylated spirit (IMS), 2% alkaline glutaraldehyde (Asep, Galen), 10% succine dialdehyde and formaldehyde mixture (Gigasept, Schulke and Mayr). Results showed that the clinical isolate of M. avium-intracellulare was the most resistant of the three test organisms. M. terrae, which is not a category 3 pathogen, was slightly more resistant than M. tuberculosis and this would appear to be a suitable surrogate for establishing tuberculocidal activity. However, with an increase in the clinical significance of M. avium-intracellulare, particularly in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and immunocompromised patients, a more resistant surrogate is required. In the absence of such a surrogate, testing with M. avium-intracellulare in a clinical laboratory equipped for handling category 3 pathogens is still advised to establish mycobactericidal activity.
