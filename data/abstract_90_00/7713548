Complicated and extrapulmonary manifestations of tuberculosis (TB) may cause prolonged suffering for the individual patient and represent a high economic burden for the society concerned. Complications of pulmonary TB may be the consequence of reduced individual resistance, immunosuppression or specific immune defects. In HIV patients, pulmonary TB is often associated with extrapulmonary lesions, while the radiologic appearance of lung infiltrates may be less prominent compared to HIV negative persons. The present review summarizes data obtained during a 12-year study of extrapulmonary TB in Berlin, Germany, and outlines the role of residual TB lesions for disease reactivation in later life. Indications and limitations of INH preventive chemotherapy will be discussed.
