Meropenem was compared in vitro with imipenem as well as with several other contemporary beta-lactams, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin against a group of highly antibiotic resistant members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and a collection of oxidase-positive and/or glucose-nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli. In this study, meropenem was more active than imipenem against isolates of Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Morganella, Providencia, Alcaligenes, Aeromonas, and Pasteurella.
