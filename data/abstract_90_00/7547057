N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant agent which has been shown to benefit patients with fulminant hepatic failure. We have examined its effect in patients with chronic liver disease undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation by giving NAC during operation. In a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 50 patients, NAC appeared to induce mild vasodilatation, improve oxygen delivery and consumption, and reduce base deficit, but data interpretation was difficult. There were no significant effects on mortality, morbidity or postoperative graft function.
