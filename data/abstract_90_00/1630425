Farm workers are approximately six times more likely to develop tuberculosis (TB) than the general population of employed adults. These recommendations are presented to assist health-care providers serving migrant and seasonal farm workers. The following services, listed by priority, that should be available for migrant and seasonal farm workers and their family members are: a) detection and diagnosis of those with current symptoms of active TB; b) appropriate treatment and monitoring for those who have current disease; c) contact investigation and appropriate preventive therapy for those exposed to infectious persons; d) screening and appropriate preventive therapy for asymptomatically infected workers who may be immunosuppressed, such as those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; e) screening and appropriate preventive therapy for children of migrant and seasonal farm workers; and f) widespread tuberculin test screening for workers and families with preventive therapy prescribed, as appropriate. Health-care providers should immediately perform appropriate diagnostic studies for persons with a productive, prolonged cough, or other symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis. Health departments should be immediately notified when TB is suspected or diagnosed to enable examination of contacts and initiation of other health department diagnostic, preventive, or patient management services. Workers and family members with uncomplicated pulmonary TB should be treated with a regimen that includes isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol (or streptomycin). Drug-resistant TB is an important consideration since it requires altered treatment regimes and because higher rates of resistance have been found in ethnic and social groups comprising much of the migrant farm worker-force. Patients should be monitored carefully for compliance, treatment response, and toxicity. Ideally, patients should be placed on directly observed therapy given by a well-trained, outreach worker from the same cultural/language background as the patients.
