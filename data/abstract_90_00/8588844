The in vitro susceptibility of 32 Mycobacterium chelonae strains to 10 antimicrobial agents was determined. The sources of the different strains were: clinical samples from patients treated at the Hospital Universitario de Canarias and Hospital del Torax (General and Chest facilities) and from environmental sources (water supply, sewage, swimming pools and the sea). The susceptibility tests were performed by a broth microdilution method (Mueller-Hinton Broth). The results showed amikacin as the most effective antimicrobial agent against M. chelonae isolates, then ofloxacin and cefoxitin. However no statistical difference was detected among them. The least effective was imipenem, followed by ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin.
