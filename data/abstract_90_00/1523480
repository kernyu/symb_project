Blood schizontocidal effect of antimalarials were compared by 4-day suppressive test with an extended observation period of 31 days. On a drug-sensitive Plasmodium berghei ANKA strain, pyronaridine (PND) exhibited the best effect, followed by amodiaquine (ADQ), mefloquine (MFQ), and qinghaosu (QHS). On a moderately chloroquine-resistant P. berghei NS line, the order of effects was the same, PND greater than ADQ greater than MFQ greater than QHS. On a highly pyronaridine-resistant P. berghei RP line, ADQ, MFQ and QHS showed cross resistance with PND.
