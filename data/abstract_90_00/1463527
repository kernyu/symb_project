Loracarbef (LY163892), a carbacephem, is the first of a new class of beta-lactam compounds. A 14-day, double-blind, randomized, parallel treatment study compared loracarbef (400 mg b.i.d.; n = 169) and amoxicillin (500 mg t.i.d.; n = 167) in the treatment of lobar pneumonia and bronchopneumonia. Forty-four patients in the loracarbef group and 40 patients in the amoxicillin group were evaluable for efficacy analysis. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were isolated from pure or mixed cultures in 45.5% of the evaluable patients, with S. pneumoniae being isolated most frequently. Favourable clinical responses (cure or improvement) in the loracarbef-treated group (42/44; 95.5%) were similar to those in the amoxicillin-treated group (38/40; 95%). A favourable bacteriological response was observed for 36/44 (81.8%) loracarbef-treated patients compared with 28/40 (70%) amoxicillin-treated patients (p = 0.2). Adverse events were similar in both groups. Withdrawal of treatment was required in three patients in each group due to gastrointestinal events or rash/allergic exanthema. These data support the conclusion that loracarbef and amoxicillin have comparable efficacy and safety in the treatment of bronchopneumonia and lobar pneumonia caused by susceptible pathogens. However, loracarbef can be administered twice daily, offering the advantage of improved patient compliance. It is also active against beta-lactamase producing organisms.
