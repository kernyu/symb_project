Fusafungine is an antibiotic extracted from the fungus Fusarium laterium WR strain 437. The antimicrobial activity of fusafungine was determined on strains from laboratory collections and clinical isolates; since fusafungine is not soluble in the classical media, the usual techniques had to be modified. MICs for all the Gram-positive cocci and bacteria tested, aerobic, or anaerobic, were below 30 mcg/ml. The antimicrobial activity included Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MIC less than 18 mcg/ml) and Streptococcus mutans (MIC less than 30 mcg/ml). An antifungal activity was shown for most of the Candida albicans tested (MIC less than 32 mcg/ml) and for different Nocardia sp. (MIC less than 13 mcg/ml). Moreover, fusafungine induced neither acquired resistance nor cross-resistance towards the antibiotics classically used in therapy.
