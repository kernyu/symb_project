After 15 years of intense AIDS research several fascinating new findings have recently produced real hope for people infected with HIV and new optimism among scientists. A second group of powerful antiretroviral drugs (proteinase inhibitors) has been introduced. These drugs can virtually stop viral replication when used in combination with other drugs (nucleoside or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors), which also almost totally eliminates the emergence of HIV-resistance. New moleculargenetic methods (plasma HIV-RNA assays) made a new marker to quantify and survey therapeutic effects and to accurately predict individual progression of HIV infection available. These new instruments also provided us with a more realistic imagination about pathogenesis and viral dynamics in HIV infection. In neonates prophylactic antiretroviral treatment of pregnant women already prevents two thirds of vertically acquired infections, and the vertical transmission rate may well continue to decline with new prophylactic regimens and/or other interventions (e.g. cesarean section). Given these splendid innovations, a huge impact on prognosis can well be anticipated in the near future.
