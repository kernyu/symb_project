Milk samples and milk products (69 in toto) were screened for the presence of Klebsiella pneumoniae (52%), and maximum isolations (77%) were from ice cream samples (13). The isolates were hydrophobic, non-haemolytic and possessed both mannose resistant (MR) and mannose sensitive (MS) pili or only MR pili when tested with human or sheep blood, respectively. All isolates were resistant to one metal at least whereas about 98% exhibited resistance to two or more metal ions. The resistance frequency of 93%, 90% and 66.7% was observed against silver (20 micrograms/ml), cadmium (20 micrograms/ml) and mercuric ions (20 micrograms/ml), respectively. Multiple drug resistance (MDR) was observed in 10% of the isolates only. A direct correlation between the metal ion and antibiotic resistance was found in MDR strains. The klebocin typeability of 53% and 61% was observed with 153-158 and 153-156, U-5 and U-6 groups, respectively. The most common typing patterns involved strains 424 (21%) and 442 (31.8%). Only 61% of the isolates showed enterotoxigenicity by the coagglutination test.
