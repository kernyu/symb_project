INTRODUCTION: Erosive pustular dermatosis of the scalp is a rare and chronic dermatosis of unknown etiology with non specific histology and without effective treatment. It affects mostly old women. We have observed a 80 year-old male suffering from an erosive pustular dermatosis of the scalp following application of 5 p. 100 fluorouracile cream (Efudex) and his resistance to various treatments including skin graft. OBSERVATION: An 80 year-old man had been suffering, for many years from recurrent episodes of pustules, erosions and crusts of the scalp, following treatment with 5 p. 100 fluorouracile cream for skin lesions diagnosed as actinic keratosis. Different topical and systemic treatments were tried without much improvement. A skin graft of the scalp lesional area was finally done, showing a severe recurrence as a Koebner's reaction. Despite this recurrence, we have observed an easier control with a topical mixture of steroid and antibiotic. CONCLUSION: This recurrence of erosive pustular dermatosis of the scalp following skin graft had never been previously observed before, showing that removing affected skin did not control the disease, suggesting that anti-inflammatory agents probably originating from trauma persist.
