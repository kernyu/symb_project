Loss of the human DNA mismatch repair pathway confers cross-resistance to structurally unrelated anticancer drugs. Examples include cisplatin, doxorubicin (adriamycin), and specific alkylating agents. We focused on defining the molecular events that link adriamycin to mismatch repair-dependent drug resistance because adriamycin, unlike drugs that covalently modify DNA, can interact reversibly with DNA. We found that adriamycin, nogalamycin, and actinomycin D comprise a class of drugs that reversibly inhibits human mismatch repair in vitro at low micromolar concentrations. The substrate DNA was not covalently modified by adriamycin treatment in a way that prevents repair, and the inhibition was independent of the number of intercalation sites separating the mismatch and the DNA nick used to direct repair, from 10 to 808 base pairs. Over the broad concentration range tested, there was no evidence for recognition of intercalated adriamycin by MutSalpha as if it were an insertion mismatch. Inhibition apparently results from the ability of the intercalated drug to prevent mismatch binding, shown using a defined mobility shift assay, which occurs at drug concentrations that inhibit repair. These data suggest that adriamycin interacts with the mismatch repair pathway through a mechanism distinct from the manner by which covalent DNA lesions are processed.
