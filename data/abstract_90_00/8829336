The intrinsic resistance of many mycobacterial species to chemotherapy is largely attributable to their impermeable cell wall. The composition of the cell wall of a particular species appears to be influenced by the environmental niche that the species occupies. The complex regulatory and biosynthetic pathways involved in cell wall biosynthesis and construction offer useful chemotherapeutic targets against mycobacteria.
