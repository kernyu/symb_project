Urethral or cervical swab of 255 patients attending Skin and Social Hygiene Centre and found positive for gram negative intracellular diplococci on direct microscopy were inoculated on Modified New York City (MNYC) medium and chocolate (heated blood) agar for isolation of neisseria gonorrhea. Growth of N. gonorrhea was obtained in 134 (52.5%) cases. These strains were tested for penicillin susceptibility by disc diffusion method and for the production of beta-lactamase by rapid penicillinase paper strip test and rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method. Penicillin resistance was found in 31 (23%) strains, of which twelve (9%) were beta-lactamase producers (PPNG), the remaining 19 (14%) strains were penicillin resistant beta-lactamase negative (Pen RB Neg). We conclude that PPNG as well as other penicillin resistant strains (Pen RB Neg) of neisseria gonorrhea are prevalent in our country and appropriate changes in the conventional therapeutic regime are desirable.
