In a previous paper (S. Kawai, S. Murao, M. Mochizuki, I. Shibuya, K. Yano, and M. Takagi, J. Bacteriol. 174:254-262, 1992), we showed that in each genome of several yeast species, there is one of two types of L41 gene, one for an L41 (Q-type) protein which confers cycloheximide (CYH) resistance or one for an L41 (P-type) protein which does not. These genes have been suggested to be responsible for the CYH response used in taxonomy. For example, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is CYH sensitive, has a P-type L41 gene, while Kluyveromyces fragilis and Candida maltosa, which are CYH resistant, have Q-type L41 genes. However, in contrast to K. fragilis, which is constitutively resistant to CYH, C. maltosa is inducibly resistant to CYH. Here, we show that C. maltosa has both types of the L41 gene in its genome and that expression of the Q-type L41 gene is induced by CYH while the P-type L41 gene is constitutively expressed.
