Characterization of Candida albicans isolates from the oral cavity of Ethiopian Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-positive patients and HIV-negative individuals was undertaken. After identification of isolates using conventional methods and determination of carbohydrate assimilation profiles, serotyping was performed by slide agglutination with the Iatron IF6 serotyping system. Sensitivity of the isolates to 5-Fluorocytosine (5-FC) was assessed using the broth macrodilution method. There was no difference in phenotype, by any of the three methods used, between the HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals. Serotype A was found to be dominant in strains isolated from both HIV-positive (34/40 = 85%) and HIV-negative (17/20 = 85%) study subjects. These data suggest that the C. albicans strains causing oral candidiasis in patients with HIV infection are identical to the commensal ones found in healthy individuals.
