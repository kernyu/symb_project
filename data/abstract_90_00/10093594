OBJECTIVES: Determine the frequency and nature of interruptions in HIV-1 protease inhibitor treatment in HIV-infected patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A longitudinal study included patients treated with antiretroviral protocols including at least one antiprotease and followed from 1 March 1996 through 1 March 1998. RESULTS: Among the 309 patients followed for the duration of the study, 137 (44.3%) interrupted their antiprotease treatment at least once. Withdrawal was warranted by therapeutic failure in 49.6% of the cases and by drug intolerance in 45.4%. Drug intolerance concerned 37%, 36.7%, 5.7% and 2.9% of the patients taking ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir respectively (p < 106). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that saquinavir was significantly associated with better tolerance and with efficacy at least as good as ritonavir or indinavir. The most frequent cause for interrupting treatment were digestive disorders for ritonavir (20% of the treated patients) and lithiasic manifestations for indinavir (9.4%). The ritonavir-hepatitis C association appeared to predispose to drug-induced perturbed liver tests. CONCLUSION: Drug intolerance is a frequent cause of treatment interruption. Therapeutic success in HIV infection requires improved efficacy but also better tolerated antiretorviral drugs, particularly antiretroviral drugs.
