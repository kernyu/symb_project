A retrospective study was conducted in 91 patients treated at the Clinic of Hematology in Novi Sad in the period January 1, 1994,-November 15, 1997. The frequency, types, characteristics and outcome of infections were examined. The causative microorganism was determined in 65% of 133 febrile episodes, in 55% Gram-negative bacteria, 39% Gram-positive bacteria and in 6% fungi. Gram-negative bacteria were causative microorganisms in 80% of pneumonia. 77% of skin infections and 93% of urinary infections. Gram-positive bacteria were causative microorganisms in 53% of sepsis, Gram-negative in 41% of sepsis and Candida in 6%. The significant resistance to antibiotics was present in 47% of Gram-negative sepsis (causative microorganisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species) and in 18% of Gram-positive sepsis (susceptibility to imipenem only in Gram-negative sepsis and susceptibility to vankomycin in Gram-positive sepsis). Infections were the cause of death in 62.8% of patients.
