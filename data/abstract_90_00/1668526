A simple and effective system for the transformation and regeneration of Lycium barbarum L. has been developed. Young stem segments from Lycium barbarum L. were infected by Agrobacterium tumefaciens harboring a vector containing neomycin phosphotransferase II (npt-II) gene derived from non-oncogenic Ti plasmid. Calli originating from young stem segments on selective induction medium could differentiate into buds on selective differentiation medium rapidly and finally developed into whole plants. NPT-II enzyme activity assay and DNA hybridization indicated that the foreign gene had been integrated into the genome of Lycium barbarum L. and could be expressed in plants.
