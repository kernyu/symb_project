Strain Serratia marcescens SMG40 was nonpigmented but yielded pigmented variants at low frequency. Of 15 tested bacteriocins, 10 were active against the original strain, but only 7 were active against the pigmented variant Pdg+. Moreover, active cephalosporins, e.g., cefotaxime, were more active against the Pdg+ variant than against strain SMG40. These reciprocal differences in susceptibility to some bacteriocins and to cefotaxime were maintained in subclones derived from Pdg+/- sectored colonies. However, mutants of pigmentation isolated from the Pdg+ variant were not modified with regard to bacteriocins and cefotaxime. Other clinical isolates of Serratia were examined for comparison, but strain SMG40 appeared to be unique.
