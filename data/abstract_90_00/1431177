A previously healthy breast-fed baby was admitted at 10 days of age to a hospital in the north of Pakistan with diarrhoea and fever. He was treated for suspected sepsis with intravenous cefotaxime and tobramycin. Cultures of blood and faeces at that time proved negative. At 12 days of age, seizures began and examination of CSF revealed evidence of pyogenic meningitis but bacteria were neither seen microscopically nor isolated in culture. Ceftazidime was substituted for cefotaxime and carbenicillin was given also. Since the baby's condition continued to deteriorate with persistent fever, vomiting and recurrent seizures, he was transferred to the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi. Examination of CSF there confirmed the diagnosis of pyogenic meningitis and revealed Gram-negative bacteria. Cultures of CSF and faeces yielded Salmonella paratyphi A but the blood culture was negative. The isolate was found to be multiple antimicrobially resistant but sensitive to ciprofloxacin. Treatment with this drug was therefore started 3 days after the baby's admission to the Aga Khan Hospital. Within 36 h, improvement was observed. From then onwards, the baby made a progressive recovery and was healthy when seen at 7 months of age.
