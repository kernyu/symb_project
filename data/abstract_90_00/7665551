Analysis of mutational effects in the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) provirus has revealed that as few as four amino acid side-chain substitutions in the HIV-1 protease (M46I/L63P/V82T/I84V) suffice to yield viral variants cross-resistant to a panel of protease inhibitors either in or being considered for clinical trials (Condra, J. H., Schleif, W. A., Blahy, O. M., Gadryelski, L. J., Graham, D. J., Quintero, J. C., Rhodes, A., Robbins, H. L., Roth, E., Shivaprakash, M., Titus, D., Yang, T., Teppler, H., Squires, K. E., Deutsch, P. J., and Emini, E. A. (1995) Nature 374, 569-571). As an initial effort toward elucidation of the molecular mechanism of drug resistance in AIDS therapies, the three-dimensional structure of the HIV-1 protease mutant containing the four substitutions has been determined to 2.4-A resolution with an R factor of 17.1%. The structure of its complex with MK639, a protease inhibitor of the hydroxyaminopentane amide class of peptidomimetics currently in Phase III clinical trials, has been resolved at 2.0 A with an R factor of 17.0%. These structures are compared with those of the wild-type enzyme and its complex with MK639 (Chen, Z., Li, Y., Chen, E., Hall, D. L., Darke, P. L., Culberson, C., Shafer, J., and Kuo, L. C. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 26344-26348). There is no gross structural alteration of the protease due to the site-specific mutations. The C alpha tracings of the two native structures are identical with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.5 A, and the four substituted side chains are clearly revealed in the electron density map. In the MK639-bound form, the V82T substitution introduces an unfavorable hydrophilic moiety for binding in the active site and the I84V substitution creates a cavity (unoccupied by water) that should lead to a decrease in van der Waals contacts with the inhibitor. These changes are consistent with the observed 70-fold increase in the Ki value (approximately 2.5 kcal/mol) for MK639 as a result of the mutations in the HIV-1 protease. The role of the M46I and L63P substitutions in drug resistance is not obvious from the crystallographic data, but they induce conformational perturbations (0.9-1.1 A) in the flap domain of the native enzyme and may affect the stability and/or activity of the enzyme unrelated directly to binding.
