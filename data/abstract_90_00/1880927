Cefpirome (CPR, HR 810), a new cephem antibiotic, was investigated for its penetration into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and its clinical efficacy against bacterial infections. 1. CSF concentrations of CPR following intravenous injection was investigated in 2 patients with purulent meningitis. In one of them, the concentrations were 2.11 micrograms/ml and 1.31 micrograms/ml on 3 and 8 days, respectively, after start of administration. In the other patient, they were 24.2 micrograms/ml, and 1.35 micrograms/ml on 2 days and 7 days after administration, respectively. 2. Antibacterial activities of CPR against clinical isolates, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, except those against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were clearly superior to those of ceftazidime. 3. Clinical efficacies evaluated in 15 patients were "excellent" in 9, "good" in 5 and "unknown" in 1. The overall efficacy rate was 93.0%. 4. Clinical efficacies were "excellent" in 1 patient with bacteremia, "excellent" in 6 and "good" in one of 7 patients with pneumonia, and "good" in both of the 2 patients with purulent meningitis. Clinical efficacies against other diseases were "excellent" or "good", in 1 patient with pyothorax, 1 patient with purulent lymphadenitis, and 2 patients with facial cellulitis. In 1 patient with biliary tract infection, the results of treatment with CPR were "unknown" due to insufficient clinical data. 5. No adverse reactions were observed except in 1 patient who showed an increase in platelet count.
