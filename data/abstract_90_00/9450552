The effects of protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors on the metallothionein (MT) gene expression induced by metals were investigated. When PKC inhibitor (H7 or chelerythrine) was administered to Cd resistant, MT gene-amplified Chinese hamster ovary (CdR) cells, the induction of MT mRNA by Cd or Zn was blocked. Treating the CdR cells with a PKA-specific inhibitor, HA1004, did not cause an inhibition of metal-induced MT gene transcription. The inhibitory effect was effectuated by adding inhibitors within 40 min of exposing the cells to Cd. Apparently, AP1 was not involved in this down-regulatory effect of PKC inhibitor on MT gene expression since the inducibility of MT promoter was blocked by H7 even in the absence of the AP1-binding sequence. For Cd-treated cells, Cd accumulation in the cell was similar with or without H7 treatment. However, H7 markedly reduced cellular Zn accumulation when the cells were treated with Zn. Cycloheximide treatment increased the level of MT mRNA. This elevation can also be blocked by treating the cell with PKC inhibitor. Results in this study suggest that PKC participates in the process of metal-induced MT gene expression.
