The multiple evaluation of the persistence characteristics, including antilysozyme, anti-interferon and anticomplement activity, as well as other biological properties, such as adhesiveness, colicinogenicity and resistance to antibiotics, was carried out in 173 E. coli strains isolated from water, healthy and sick children. This evaluation revealed that each group of E. coli, depending on the source of its isolation, had its characteristic set of properties (or bioprofiles) to be analyzed, making it different from other bacterial populations. The comparative intergroup analysis showed differences between E. coli isolated from children with pathological conditions (enteric coli-bacteriosis, pyelonephritis) and E. coli isolated from water and feces of healthy children. These differences were manifested by more pronounced persistence characteristics. Dispersion analysis, having confirmed this feature, revealed that the most labile characteristics of E.coli, subject to the influence of ecological conditions, were their markers of persistence and antibiotic resistance. The results of factor analysis made it possible to unite the above mentioned properties which determined, together with adhesiveness, pathogenic potential of these bacteria.
