This is a status report of a retrospectively assembled cohort of 3357 smear-positive patients initiated on anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy in the North Arcot district between April 1986 and March 1988. The patients were contacted once at their homes between November 1988 and June 1989 (6 and 36 months after start of treatment), and information on their status, including death, could be obtained from 76% of them. Regimens were selected by the patients. 2306 (69%) had accepted short course regimens (SCC) and 1051 (31%) had been started on standard chemotherapy (non-SCC), 43% and 35% in SCC and non-SCC respectively had completed 80% or more of their treatment. Overall mortality was 28%. Of those remaining, 31% had active disease and were excreting bacilli, among which 65% of the cultures were resistant to isoniazid and 12% to rifampicin. Combined resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin was seen in 4% and to isoniazid and streptomycin was seen in 19%. A significant finding was that even among those who had taken less than 50% of their treatment, 56% were bacteriologically negative. However, inadequate or irregular chemotherapy resulted in over four times the mortality and about twice the rate of smear positivity as compared with those taking adequate chemotherapy. No comparisons are made between patients on short-course and standard regimens as the patients selected their treatment and the groups are not comparable.
