Teicoplanin (4 micrograms/ml) combined with 4 micrograms/ml of ampicillin, mezlocillin, and piperacillin, respectively, proved more efficacious than vancomycin (4 micrograms/ml) combined with the three beta-lactam antibiotics against three representative clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecalis that showed high-level-gentamicin resistance (HLGR). In the presence of 65% (v/v) of fresh defibrinated human blood, teicoplanin (4 micrograms/ml) alone afforded significant bactericidal activity, but failed to completely sterilize assay tube contents, whereas teicoplanin combined with any of the three beta-lactam antibiotics consistently and completely killed HLGR E. faecalis inocula.
