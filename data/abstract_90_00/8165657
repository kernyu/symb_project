Pasture helminthoses of sheep and goats should permanently be under parasitological control. Starting from 6 principles the economically most important pasture helminthoses--Trichostrongylidosis, Dictyocaulosis, Protostrongylinosis, Monieziosis, Fasciolosis and Dicrocoeliosis--are reviewed under the aspect of control strategies. The controlled use of highly effective anthelmintics of different compound classes is suitable in regulating helminth populations. The problems of anthelmintic resistance and anthelmintic residues are mentioned.
