Pseudomonas aeruginosa encodes three types of xenobiotic efflux pumps, MexAB-OprM, MexCD-OprJ, and MexEF-OprN, which are regulated by the nalB, nfxB, and nfxC genes, respectively, and their high expression renders the cells resistant to multiple species of antibiotics. We evaluated the role of the outer membrane permeability barrier and the efflux pump in lowering the intracellular concentration of fluorescent probes. The wild-type, nalB, nfxB, and nfxC strains with an intact outer membrane showed equally high capability in draining out intracellular fluorescent dye, 2-(4-dimethylaminostyryl)-1-ethylpyridinium and ethidium bromide. When the outer membrane barrier was dismantled by the EDTA treatment, wild-type, nfxC, nfxB, and nalB strains showed significantly different levels of dye accumulation. The polymyxin B-treated cells showed an even more pronounced difference in dye accumulation among the nfxC, nfxB, and nalB mutants. We concluded from these results that the xenobiotic extrusion pumps interplay with the outer membrane permeability barrier in lowering the intracellular substrate concentration. Among three extrusion pumps in P. aeruginosa, MexAB-OprM was the most efficient, followed by MexCD-OprJ and MexEF-OprN pumps for the fluorescent dye extrusion.
