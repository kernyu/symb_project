The susceptibility of 45 strains of Neisseria gonorrhoea was studied measuring minimal inhibitory concentrations of five antimicrobials. Results show that 66.7% of strains are resistant to tetracycline and 11.2% to penicillin. All strains were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime. This results should prompt to perform surveillance in different areas of Santiago and to establish new therapeutic norms for the treatment of gonococcal infections.
