Increasing antibiotic resistance of bacteria that infect prosthetic joints has stimulated interest in the incorporation of more effective antimicrobial agents into polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). Vancomycin and daptomycin are effective against nearly all staphylococci and streptococci, and amikacin has a broader spectrum against gram-negative bacilli than do other aminoglycosides such as gentamicin. These three antibiotics maintained bioactivity after incorporation into several commonly used preparations of PMMA and eluted readily into the surrounding medium. Preparing PMMA under negative atmospheric pressure, which decreases porosity, caused a 50% reduction in antibiotic release; the addition of 25% dextran, which increases porosity, greatly facilitated elution of these antibiotics. Based on their broad antibacterial effect against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, inclusion of vancomycin and amikacin in PMMA merits clinical study. The addition of these antibiotics to PMMA, together with dextran, may be applicable when structural integrity is unimportant but a substantial local antimicrobial effect is desired, such as in the use of antibiotic-containing beads to treat osteomyelitis.
