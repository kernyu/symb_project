We studied 266 patients with drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis at national sanatoria in Japan. The patients included 218 men (mean age, 58 years) and 48 women (mean age, 62 years). The levels of isoniazid and rifampicin resistance were determined at 1 mcg/mL and 50 mcg/mL, respectively. The results were as follows. (1) Most patients with drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis were middle-aged or past middle-aged. (2) There were many cases of drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis in previously treated tuberculosis patients with active disease and several cases in previously untreated pulmonary tuberculosis patients. However, in some previously untreated patients active tuberculosis was convert relatively easily to inactive tuberculosis. (3) Concerning life style, bachelors who drank heavily were more likely to develop drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis. (4) Most cases of drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis had at least one cavity on chest radiographs. (5) Several patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis left the hospital against the advice of their attending doctors; therefore, it was difficult to treat their illnesses. (6) In more than half the cases in which Mycobacterium tuberculosis was resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin, tolerance to streptomycin and ethanbutol was also seen. (7) When patients with drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis continued to have tuberculous bacilli in their sputum after 3 months of chemotherapy, there was a tendency for them to expectorate tuberculous bacilli in their sputum. For these drug-resistant tuberculosis patients, we must pay attention not only to the medical aspects but also to the social aspects of their disease.
