The authors present their clinical experience with fibre-carbon posts, which has been carried on for more than 4 years, supporting it with studies made in European and U.S.A. Universities, specially regarding the mechanical resistance and retention of those posts. Tests show luting procedures as the critical and improvable point. No real retention increase results using Sealbond and Flexi-Flow composite cements; failure always occurs at cement-post junction. Using a special fibre-carbon post, named Composipost Retentive, which presents circumferential grooves, very superior retention is obtained. Using 5 types of composite cement (Sticky Post, Flexi-Flow, Sealbond, Super Bond and All Bond II), we reach a very high retention. Super Bond and All Bond II specially show a tensile strength over 120 kg measured with Instrom machine. Those two composite cements massively penetrate in dentinal tubules, giving best results in cement-root channel interface.
