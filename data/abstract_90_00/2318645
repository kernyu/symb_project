In a retrospective study, the efficacy of tetracycline therapy was assessed in 48 men with non-gonococcal urethritis who only harbored Ureaplasma urealyticum in their urethras. After 2 weeks of therapy with 2.0 g oxytetracycline per day, U. urealyticum was still found in the urethra of 8 patients (17%). Urethritis was still present in 8 patients (17%) according to clinical criteria and in 11 patients (23%) according to microscopic findings. The persistence of U. urealyticum in the urethra did not correlate with the persistence of urethritis to a statistically significant degree. Therapy compliance, antibiotic resistance in a few cases, reinfections in 2 cases and a special host-parasite relationship are discussed with respect to the treatment failures.
