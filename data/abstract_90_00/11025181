Fluconazole susceptibility was tested in 100 clinical yeast isolates (65 Candida albicans, 13 C. glabrata, 8 C. tropicalis, 7 C. parapsilosis, 3 Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 1 each of C. krusei, C. lusitaniae, Cryptococcus neoformans, Rhodotorula glutinis) and two control strains (Candida krusei ATCC 6258, C. parapsilosis ATCC 22019) using broth microdilution (reference method), disk diffusion, Etest strips, Sensititre YeastOne, Candifast, Integral System Yeasts. Using M27-A breakpoints, isolates were classified as susceptible (81%), susceptible-dose dependent or Resistant with broth dilution. Rates of concordance with the reference method were good for Sensititre YeastOne, Etest and disc-diffusion (81.2%-94.7%) but very low for the Candifast (3.1%) and Integral System (16.6%), which classified most susceptible isolates as resistant. Lack of standardisation (inoculum, medium composition) and non-objective interpretation schemes may be the cause of their poor performance. Sensititre YeastOne, Etest and disc-diffusion are potentially useful for fluconazole antifungal susceptibility testing of yeasts in clinical laboratories.
