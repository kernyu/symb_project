We previously showed that stress failure of pulmonary capillaries occurs at transmural pressures of approximately 50 cmH2O (40 mmHg) and above in rabbit lung. In this study, we examined whether pulmonary capillaries are more resistant to failure in dogs than in rabbits. This might be expected because of the greater athletic ability of dogs and therefore their presumably greater tolerance to large cardiac outputs and higher pulmonary vascular pressures. The lungs of 12 anesthetized mongrel dogs [22.1 +/- 5.2 (SD) kg] were perfused in situ with autologous blood and then with saline-dextran (5 min) and glutaraldehyde solution (10 min), all three perfusions at the same preset transmural pressure of 32.5, 72.5, 92.5, or 112.5 cmH2O. In dogs, the stress failure curves relating break number per millimeter of epithelium and endothelium were right shifted by approximately 40 cmH2O compared with rabbits. Blood-gas barrier thickness was significantly greater than in rabbits at 32.5 cmH2O, and unlike in rabbits, neither total nor interstitial thickness increased significantly with increasing pressure. These results indicate that pulmonary capillaries are more resistant to stress failure in dogs than rabbits.
