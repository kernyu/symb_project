Wild-type spores of Bacillus subtilis were resistant to eight cycles of freeze-drying, whereas about 90% of spores lacking the two major DNA-binding proteins (small, acid-soluble proteins alpha and beta) were killed by three to four cycles of freeze-dryings, with significant mutagenesis and DNA damage accompanying the killing. This role for alpha/beta-type small, acid-soluble proteins in spore resistance to freeze-drying may be important in spore survival in the environment.
