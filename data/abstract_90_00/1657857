The susceptibility of sparfloxacin, a new broad spectrum fluoroquinolone, was determined for 72 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 15 Xanthomonas maltophilia, and 19 Pseudomonas spp. The activity of sparfloxacin was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and other reference antibiotics. Sparfloxacin was the most active antibiotic tested against X. maltophilia (MIC90 1 mg/l) and the most active quinolone against P. cepacia and P. putrifaciens. Ciprofloxacin, however, demonstrated greater activity than sparfloxacin against P. fluorescens and P. stutzeri. P. aeruginosa was most susceptible to ciprofloxacin with an MIC90 of 2 mg/l, compared with an MIC90 of 8 mg/l for sparfloxacin and ofloxacin. Although cross-resistance between quinolones was noted, cross-resistance between antibiotic classes was not seen. Aminoglycoside-resistant and aminoglycoside-susceptible P. aeruginosa strains were equally susceptible to sparfloxacin. Kill curves showed sparfloxacin to be rapidly bactericidal against P. aeruginosa at 1 x MIC. Sparfloxacin demonstrated greater bactericidal activity than ciprofloxacin at 1 x and 2 x their MICs. Unlike ciprofloxacin and gentamicin, sparfloxacin showed sustained bactericidal activity at greater than or equal to 1 MIC for 24 h.
