A total of 426 cultures for nonspecific organisms, made at the Bacteriological Laboratory of the Antituberculosis Dispensary, were analyzed. Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus were most common among the isolated pathogens. Evaluation of antibiotic sensitivity by using the disks showed augmentin, cefuroxime axetil, and ciprofloxacin to be most effective. Streptomycin and rifampicin resistance of pathogens was highest. In patients with tuberculosis, the non-tuberculosis flora showed resistance to the drugs widely used in general practice (ampicillin, carbenicillin, oxacillin, lincomycin, erythromycin). Among macrolides, rovamycin was more effective than erythromycin. It is concluded that when wide-spectrum antibiotics are prescribed, new and potent drugs should be used in a tuberculosis hospital.
