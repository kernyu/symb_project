The in vitro activities of teicoplanin and vancomycin against 288 gram positive cocci were determined by broth macrodilution method. MIC 90 values for teicoplanin were lmcg/ml for coagulase positive staphylococci (n = 115), 4 mcg/ml for coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 93), 0.50 mcg/ml for S. faecalis (n = 50) and 0.125 mcg/ml for S. pyogenes (n = 30). MIC 90 values for vancomycin were lmcg/ml 1 mcg/ml, 1 mcg/ml and 0.25 mcg/ml respectively. We were not able to detect in vitro resistance against teicoplanin and vancomycin.
