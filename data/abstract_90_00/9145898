The fluoroquinolone trovafloxacin was bactericidal (0.47 +/- 0.23 delta log10 CFU/ml x h after 10 mg/kg of body weight and 0.78 +/- 0.15 delta log10 CFU/ml x h after 30 mg/kg) in the treatment of experimental meningitis caused by a highly penicillin-resistant (MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration = 4 and 4 microg/ml) strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
