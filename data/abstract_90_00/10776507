A total of 326 salmonella strains was isolated and studied from suspected enteric fever cases in Mumbai (Bombay) during a 2 year period from May 1992 to July 1994. These were identified using standard biochemical and serological tests. Bacteriophage typing, antibiotic sensitivity and conjugation experiments were also carried out. S. typhi was the most common serotype accounting for 75.46% of the strains. Among S. typhi strains 87% were biotype I and 13% were biotype II. 9.5% strains were of S. paratyphi A, 5.52% of S. typhimurium, 4.60% of S. worthington, 4.30% of S. havana and 0.62% of S. enteritidis. The commonest bacteriophage type of S. typhi was E1, and of S. paratyphi A type 1, whereas 88.88% strains of S. typhimurium were untypable. Most of the strains were multidrug resistant including commonly used antibiotics such as chloramphemicol, ampicillin, and cotrimaxazole. Quinolone derivatives such as Ciprofloxacin were found to be the most effective drugs. In the conjugation experiments there was direct transfer of resistance pattern and enbloc transfer of resistance was observed in most strains. Salmonella typhi is still the most commonly encountered species. There is an alarming increase in multidrug resistance.
