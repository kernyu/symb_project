AIMS: Multi-drug resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria is a rapidly increasing problem in the world, particularly Thailand. Practical antimalarial regimens which are highly effective against multi-drug resistant parasites with short-term course of administration are needed. In this study, we assessed the patient compliance of a short course regimen using artemether-mefloquine. METHODS: Clinical effectiveness (efficacy, tolerability and patient compliance) of a 2-day regimen of artemether-mefloquine was evaluated in 126 patients with acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria who were attending the two malaria clinics in an area of highly multi-drug resistant P. falciparum malaria (Thai-Myanmar border). Patients were treated with a single oral dose of 300 mg artemether on the day of attendance. Two additional doses of mefloquine were given for home treatment on the following day (750 and 500 mg after breakfast and lunch, respectively). RESULTS: The combination regimen was effective, with a cure rate of 92.6%. Based upon the concentrations of whole blood mefloquine on day-2, compliance for this 2 day regimen of artemether-mefloquine was 98.1% (full compliance 86.8%, partial compliance 11.3%, non-compliance 1.9%). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the 2 day regimen of artemether-mefloquine is, at present, a good alternative regimen for the treatment of uncomplicated multi-drug resistant falciparum malaria.
