Human hepatitis B virus, the leading pathogen for hepatitis B, is a compact DNA virus with viral genes that largely overlap. An increasing number of mutations have emerged following human interventions such as vaccination and anti-viral therapy. While vaccine escape mutants are characterized by mutations on the antigenic hepatitis B surface antigen, those carrying mutations in other viral proteins are either resistant to anti-viral therapy or implicated in acute liver diseases. Molecular identification of these various mutants should shed new lights on the underlying mechanism of hepatitis B virus viral escape and resistance and provide helpful information on their effective eradication.
