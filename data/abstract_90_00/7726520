The in vivo efficacy of ciprofloxacin or pefloxacin alone or in combination with fosfomycin was evaluated in experimental aortic valve endocarditis induced in 133 rabbits by a multidrug-susceptible or multidrug-resistant strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Therapy was initiated early (12 h after infection), when bacterial counts in aortic valve vegetations were relatively low, or late (48 h after infection), when vegetations contained a larger inoculum. Antibodies were administered as a continuous 24-h intravenous infusion. Mean steady-state levels of ciprofloxacin (64 mg/kg), pefloxacin (64 mg/kg), and fosfomycin (300 mg/kg) in serum were 2.5, 4.2, and 63.9 mg/liter, respectively. For the multidrug-susceptible strain, all regimens except pefloxacin alone significantly reduced the number of CFU per gram of vegetation versus controls, whether treatment was performed early or late. For the multidrug-resistant strain, none of the regimens showed differences from untreated controls, except ciprofloxacin-fosfomycin, which significantly reduced bacterial counts in vegetations compared with controls when therapy was begun early (4.1 +/- 1.1 log10 CFU/g of vegetation; P < 0.001 versus the control). These data suggest that combination of fosfomycin with ciprofloxacin or pefloxacin is more effective than ciprofloxacin or pefloxacin alone for the therapy of severe infections caused by multidrug-susceptible P. aeruginosa.
