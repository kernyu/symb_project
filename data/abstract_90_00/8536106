We and others have previously observed that the antiviral effects of autocrine interferon (IFN)-alpha/beta activity cannot be abolished by neutralizing antibodies, even when present to a large excess. This raises the possibility that the major part of autocrine activity is triggered intracellularly, possibly bypassing the transmembrane IFN-alpha/beta receptor. To examine this possibility, cells derived from IFN-alpha/beta Ro/o knockout mice lacking a functional IFN-alpha/beta receptor were stably transformed with pHMB-KbMuIFN beta or pMFG-MuIFN beta plasmids encoding a constitutively expressed murine IFN-beta gene. Four different clones were isolated and examined for resistance to a retrovirus, MFG-LacZ, and to Semliki Forest virus. Despite the production of autocrine IFN-beta at levels inducing high antiviral resistance in control cells, none of the clones displayed antiviral resistance. Thus, despite its failure to be neutralized by potent antiserum, the antiviral activity of autocrine IFN-beta takes place via the transmembrane IFN-alpha/beta receptor, and no additional pathway is involved.
