In view of the newer antibiotics that can cover the spectrum of organisms in mixed infections, single agents are now a viable option for antimicrobial therapy. In addition, monotherapy is relatively nontoxic and possibly less costly than combination therapy. Combinations may be more effective in preventing the emergence of resistance, however, and can also provide synergistic effects. They are a necessity in mycobacterial infections, enterococcal endocarditis, and deep-seated pseudomonal infections, as well as in patients with gram-negative bacillary infection with profound granulocytopenia.
