The increasing antimicrobial resistance in Helicobacter pylori has led to the search for new therapeutic agents. In this in vitro study, novel compounds combining bismuth with sialic acid inhibitors were investigated for bactericidal activity using time-kill methodology. The activity of these compounds was compared to bismuth subcitrate against a type strain and a clinical isolate of H. pylori. The compounds tested showed cidal activity which was related to the bismuth component of each drug. These compounds may offer a potential advantage over current bismuth preparations with the sialic acid inhibitor moiety interfering with adhesion of H. pylori to gastric epithelium.
