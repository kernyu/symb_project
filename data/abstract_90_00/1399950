The activity of RP 59500 against Gram-positive cocci was determined by an agar dilution method and compared with that of erythromycin, cefotaxime and ampicillin. Of the 344 clinical isolates tested, none was resistant to RP 59500; this compound was active both against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and against macrolide-resistant Gram-positive cocci. The bactericidal activity of RP 59500 was confirmed by killing curve determinations.
