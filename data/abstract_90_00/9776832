BMS 181184 (BMS), an analogue of pradimicin, was administered intravenously to neutropenic mice infected with either a fluconazole-susceptible or a fluconazole-resistant clinical isolate of Candida tropicalis. BMS prolonged survival at doses >3 mg kg -1 day-1, and at higher doses reduced tissue counts in mice. BMS was less potent mg for mg than amphotericin B. Combined BMS and amphotericin B were no more effective than either of the individual drugs.
