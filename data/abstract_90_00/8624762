Substantial differences have been described in the response of individual patients to zidovudine (ZDV) therapy, both in the clinical impact and in virus load. Genotypic changes associated with the appearance of drug resistance may also be different or occur at different rates. We have obtained the nucleotide sequence of the RT domain of individual HIV-1 genomes extracted from 10 plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples donated by two haemophiliac patients before, during, and after long-term ZDV therapy. Although the plasma virus load was similar throughout, the order and timing of appearance of resistance-associated substitutions differed in the two patients. In patient p74, K70R appeared after 4 months, T215Y at 5.5 months, and M41L at 13 months. In p87, K70R also appeared at 4 months, but T215Y and K219Q were not observed until 18 months and M41L not at all. Much greater sequence change overall occurred in p74. The evolution of the viral population in that patient was dominated by the unique appearance of T215Y and subsequently M41L, with all sequences from the last time point being descended by a single path from the pretreatment samples. However, in p87, several different lineages of RT sequences were found to persist throughout treatment. We propose that these differences in outcome may be determined by differences in genetic background at sites other than the five generally considered to be associated with ZDV sensitivity.
