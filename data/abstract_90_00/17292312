Animals are a wide source of salmonellas for humans and their environment. Domestic ruminants play an important role because of their high susceptibility to salmonellas infection giving an acute disease with massive salmonella excretion and mortality if lack of treatment. As in human medicine use of antibiotics at therapeutic doses in animals can lead to the selection of resistant strains may be pathogenic for humans by direct contact or through environment and food. Taking into account the importance of salmonellosis on calves in rearing units, CNEVA Lyon has set up since 1982 a national network for antimicrobial resistance monitoring of main bacterial pathogens in bovine. This network allowed to detect a recent evolution of antimicrobial susceptibility in salmonella from dairy cows related with new problem of salmonellosis in cattle.
