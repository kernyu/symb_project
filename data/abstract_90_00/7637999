Plasmodium falciparum susceptibility to chloroquine in vivo and to chloroquine, mefloquine, quinine, amodiaquine and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine in vitro was investigated in children living in Goundry village, Oubritenga Province (Burkina Faso) in November 1992. An extended WHO in vivo field test was used, with follow-up on days 2, 4, 7, 14, 21 and 28 after treatment with 25 mg chloroquine per kg body weight given over 3 days, in children from 2 to 8 years old with P. falciparum monospecific infection, asexual parasitaemia > 800 parasites/microliter of blood and negative Bergqvist urine tests. At the same time, the in vitro response was assessed using WHO standard test kits. Out of the 71 in vivo responses examined, 50 (70.4%) were classified as resistant to chloroquine at RI (43.6%) or RII (26.8%) levels. There were no RIII responses. Out of the 43 isolates tested for chloroquine susceptibility in vitro, 32 (74.4%) were resistant to the drug with mean EC50 and EC99 values of 1.41 mumol and 10.96 mumol/l of blood, respectively. Resistance to sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine in vitro was observed in one out of 19 tested cases, with mean EC50 and EC99 values of 0.00002 mumol and 35.05 mumol/l of blood, respectively. All isolates were inhibited by mefloquine at 12.8 mumol/l of blood, quinine at 51.2 mumol/l of blood and amodiaquine at 0.4 mumol/l of blood, indicating full sensitivity to these 3 drugs. The present study demonstrates the high prevalence of chloroquine-resistant strains of P. falciparum in the study area of Burkina Faso and indicates that isolates resistant to sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine may also be present.
