MICs of imipenem (IPM), panipenem (PAPM), cefozopran (CZOP), cefpirome (CPR), gentamicin (GM), tobramycin (TOB) and amikacin (AMK) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were determined using Mueller-Hinton agar and low-amino-acid agar. On Mueller-Hinton agar, the antibacterial activity of TOB was superlative, followed in order by GM, CZOP, IPM, AMK, PAPM and CPR, whereas on low-amino-acid agar, the order changed to IPM, PAPM, TOB, CZOP, GM, AMK and CPR. The largest decrease of MICs was seen with PAPM on low-amino-acid agar, and the antibacterial activity of PAPM was not stronger than that of IPM. The growth of P. aeruginosa on the low-amino-acid agar were significantly weaker than that on Mueller-Hinton agar, hence the evaluation of appearance colonies was difficult and misjudgement may result. Based on the above observations, we believe further investigations are needed before the application of low-amino-acid agar becomes routine.
