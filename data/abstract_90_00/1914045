Beta-lactams and aminoglycosides are widely used in the therapy of serious Gram negative infections in pediatrics. In order to survey acquired resistance, the phenotype of resistance to beta-lactams and aminoglycosides were characterized for 260 strains of enterobacteriaceae among the mainly isolated species in pediatrics. These phenotypes were established according to the results of the disk susceptibility tests for beta-lactams respectively ampicillin, ticarcillin, cefaloridin and cefotaxim, and aminoglycosides, streptomycin (S), gentamicin (G), tobryamycin (T), amikacin (A), and netilmicin (N). 49% of E. coli and 73% of P. mirabilis strains were resistant to 3 beta-lactams (RRRS). 72% of Salmonella spp. strains were resistant to 4 beta-lactams (RRRR). For the majority of strains, the mainly observed resistance phenotype to aminoglycosides was streptomycin resistance excepted for Salmonella spp., which was S + KGTNA. The high level of acquired resistance to beta-lactams and aminoglycosides among Enterobacteriaceae with the selection of multiresistant strains would be explained by the wild use of cefotaxim and amikacin in pediatrics.
