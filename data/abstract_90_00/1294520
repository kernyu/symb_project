In order to assess the resistance profile for fosfomycin trometamol after several years of clinical use in Italy, this study has explored the susceptibility to fosfomycin and eight other antibacterial drugs of 6,021 strains isolated from 23,816 urines during 1990 in three teaching hospitals located in Genoa, Parma and Catania. Gram-negative strains, notably Escherichia coli (41.6%), were primarily involved. Amoxicillin was the least active compound with resistance in 41.4% of the isolates. Fosfomycin showed the lowest rate of resistance in both gram-negative (2.8%) and gram-positive (2.1%) pathogens. This was followed by norfloxacin with a resistance rate of 11.8% and netilmicin with 12.2%. These results indicate that fosfomycin-trometamol may continue to be used in single-dose treatment of urinary tract infections even in the absence of microbiological data since the prevalence of resistance to the drug is, at present, so low that therapeutic failure is highly improbable.
