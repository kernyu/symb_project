Antimicrobial therapy is an important tool in reducing the enormous losses in the poultry industry caused by Escherichia coli infections (colibacillosis). However, resistance to existing antimicrobials is widespread and of concern to poultry veterinarians. Antimicrobial resistance testing of 468 avian E. coli strains isolated in Spain showed very high levels of resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (67%) and the new fluoroquinolones (13 to 24%). As these antimicrobial agents may cause cross-resistance with human enteric pathogens, prudent use of them in veterinary medicine is highly recommended.
