When Mycobacterium bovis BCG and Staphylococcus aureus were plated on agar containing increasing concentrations of fluoroquinolone, colony numbers exhibited a sharp drop, followed by a plateau and a second sharp drop. The plateau region correlated with the presence of first-step resistant mutants. Mutants were not recovered at concentrations above those required for the second sharp drop, thereby defining a mutant prevention concentration (MPC). A C-8-methoxy group lowered the MPC for an N-1-cyclopropyl fluoroquinolone.
