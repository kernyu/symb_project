A collection of 39 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) stains derived from six different hospitals in Ankara and one hospital in Barsa, Turkey, were analyzed by multiple genotyping. In agreement with the other genotyping assays, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of DNA macrorestriction fragments identified genetic homogeneity among all MRSA isolates studies. It is concluded that a major clone of MRSA has spread through a large part of Turkey, causing longitudinally persistent colonization in all of the institutions surveyed.
