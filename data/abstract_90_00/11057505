The emergence of invasive penicillin-resistant (PRSP) and multidrug-resistant (MDRP) Streptococcus pneumoniae was tracked from 1989 to 1998 in one medium-sized metropolitan area in the USA, encompassing western West Virginia, including Huntington, the only major city, and neighboring sections of Kentucky and Ohio. Capsular serotyping and antibiotic sensitivity tests were performed on 350 community-acquired isolates comprising 93.1% of all pneumococcal isolates identified. The incidence of PRSP increased from 3 to 10% during the 10 years of the study. Twenty-nine (22.1%) of 131 isolates of serotypes 6, 9, 14, 19, and 23 were PRSP (one-fourth were MDRP) and 1 (0.5%) of 219 other serotypes was PRSP (serotype 35). Invasive PRSP occurred most frequently in young children and in adults aged 80 years and older, 8.9 and 10.9 cases per 100,000 persons, respectively.
