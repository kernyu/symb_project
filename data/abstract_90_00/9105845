The in vitro activity of fosfomycin in combination with ceftazidime, imipenem, amikacin, or ciprofloxacin was studied by an agar plate checkerboard method against 40 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa with various antibiotic resistance profiles. Fosfomycin/ciprofloxacin appeared to be the most effective combination (synergy 15%, addition 80%, indifference 5%), followed by fosfomycin/amikacin (synergy 7.5%, addition 52.5%, indifference 40%), fosfomycin/imipenem (addition 37%, indifference 63%), and fosfomycin/ceftazidime (addition 20%, indifference 80%). The effects of the combinations were not significantly influenced by the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of the strains.
