Coagulase-negative staphylococci are resident flora of the human being and not harmful for ordinary patients. However they cause serious infection for the compromised host, especially the patients with prosthetic valve, prosthetic joint, cerebrospinal fluid shunt, or intravascular catheter. Recent progress of medicine has resulted in the increase of compromised hosts. So, coagulase-negative staphylococci became one of the significant pathogens of hospital infections. Moreover, some hospital strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci demonstrate the resistance against most of the antibiotics recently. To prevent the hospital infection caused by those strains, the contamination control of the prosthetic insert is essential. When once the infection is caused on the prosthetic insert, they have to be removed in most cases.
