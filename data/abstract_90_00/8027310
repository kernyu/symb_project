The ability of MicroScan rapid panels (Baxter MicroScan, West Sacramento, Calif.) to detect oxacillin resistance in 92 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and 103 coagulase-negative staphylococci was evaluated by comparing results with those of MicroScan 24-h MIC panels and, to resolve discrepancies, oxacillin agar screening. Both panels were interpreted by the MicroScan WalkAway-96 system. Rapid panels detected 96.7% of resistant S. aureus isolates and 72% of resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, 22 of which did not grow in the panels.
