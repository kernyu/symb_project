The in vitro activity of LY333328 was evaluated for 1,479 nosocomial gram-positive pathogens isolated in 12 countries during 1997. LY333328 MICs at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited for Enterococcus faecalis (n = 351), Enterococcus faecium (n = 100), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 593), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species (n = 325), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 110) were 1, 1, 2, 2, and 0.015 microg/ml, respectively. LY333328 demonstrated potent activity against isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci, oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci.
