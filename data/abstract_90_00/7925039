One hundred and three children (1% of seriously ill children referred to the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra) were admitted with bacterial meningitis over a 17 month period. 43 of these children had been ill for more than 4 days before arrival at our centre. The main causative organisms were S. pneumoniae (47.9%), Neisseria meningitides (38.4%) and Haemophilus influenzae (9.6%). All bacterial isolates were highly sensitive to ceftriaxone. Resistance to penicillin and chloramphenicol was however present in 5-17% of isolates. All cerebrospinal fluid samples were sterilised within 48 hours of antibiotic treatment. Case fatality rate was 22% with the majority of deaths occurring within hours of admission and closely related to S. pneumoniae infection. Neurological complications occurred in 22%; mild diarrhoea in 33% and secondary fever in 14.8% of survivors. No significant difference was noted among the three treatment regimens of ceftriaxone alone, penicillin plus chloramphenicol, and ceftriaxone alone for 48 hours followed by penicillin/chloramphenicol combination. Our overall outcome would have been better if patients had been started on appropriate antibiotic treatment within the earlier hours of the infection. Furthermore, the latter generation cephalosporins, including ceftriaxone, must be given consideration as antibiotics of first choice world wide.
