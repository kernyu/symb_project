Reverse transcriptase plays an essential role in the early steps of the replicative cycle of retroviruses. Because of the resistance against nucleoside analogue inhibitors such as 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine, the importance of the investigation of non-nucleoside analogue inhibitors is increasing. We have investigated the influence of trifluoperazine (TFP--a species of phenothiazines) and its newly prepared TFP-metal complexes (TFP-VO(IV), TFP-Cu(II), TFP-Ni(II), TFP-Pd(II), TFP-Sn(IV)). The compounds were tested on Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase assay. The inhibitory effect of metal complexes was higher than that of TFP. TFP-VO(IV) showed higher effectiveness compared the added effect of parent tricyclic chemical and metal. Therefore we concluded that the improved biological action depends on the formation of metal complexes. This phenothiazine and its metal coordination complexes could become a new non-nucleoside analogue group of compounds inhibiting the retrovirus replication.
