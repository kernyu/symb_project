A new agglutination test (Monostaph +; Bionor, Skien, Norway) has been developed. This new agglutination test has been compared with two other agglutination tests for the identification of 128 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and 82 coagulase-negative staphylococci. The sensitivities of both Monostaph + and Pastorex Staph-Plus were excellent (98.7 and 97.4%, respectively) in detection of oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The specificity was 96.4% (two Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates and one Staphylococcus hominis isolate were false positive).
