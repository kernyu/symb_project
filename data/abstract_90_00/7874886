Susceptibilities of 414 nasal and 586 nonnasal Staphylococcus aureus isolates, both methicillin resistant and methicillin susceptible, to the topical antimicrobial agent mupirocin were compared. A susceptibility of 99.1% was observed for the 1000 isolates. Nasal and nonnasal isolates showed a similar 90% minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90) and statistically equivalent percent susceptibilities.
