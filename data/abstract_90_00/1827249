One hundred and sixty two antibiotic resistant strains of Salmonella isolated within 1984-1988 in Leningrad and the Leningrad Region were tested with respect to their sensitivity to new antibiotics and chemotherapeutics developed or being developed in the USSR. At the background of high numbers of circulating Salmonella strains resistant to the routinely used antibiotics such as doxycycline, streptomycin and gentamicin they appeared to be highly sensitive to amikacin, ciprofloxacin, pefloxacin and the 3rd generation cephalosporins i.e. ceftazidime and cefotaxime as well as to thienamycin. These modern antibacterial agents are possibly to be the drugs of choice in etiotropic treatment and chemoprophylaxis of septic acute intestinal infections due to Salmonella strains with multiple resistance. Resistance of individual Salmonella strains to cefotaxime and ceftazidime indicated that it was possible to use their property for additional labeling of the pathogens within a serological type of Salmonella while conducting epidemiological examinations during outbreaks of acute intestinal infections of Salmonella etiology.
