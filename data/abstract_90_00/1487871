The study was undertaken to examine 84 patients mainly with coronary heart disease and various cardiac arrhythmias. Quinidine monotherapy was found to normalize heart rate depending on its baseline values: it reduced heart rate in tachycardias and increased it in bradycardia. In patients with severe myocardial damage, especially in hypertension, quinidine decreased cardiac index, whereas total peripheral resistance increased. With quinidine, systolic pressure, stroke and cardiac indices showed a more decrease, whereas diastolic pressure and total peripheral resistance displayed a more increase in the standing position. Supplement of digoxin corrected negative quinidine-induced hemodynamic changes and orthostatic failures.
