Until recently, therapy for most Nontuberculous Mycobacterial (NTM) disease, especially disease caused by Mycobacterium avium-complex (MAC), has been difficult and frustrating. The introduction of the newer macrolides (clarithromycin and azithromycin) has significantly added to the efficacy of regimens for both disseminated and pulmonary MAC disease. Clinical activity of these agents is lost when a MAC isolate develops in-vitro resistance that is facilitated by use of the macrolides as single agents. These valuable drugs should, therefore, never be used as single agents for the treatment of disseminated or pulmonary MAC disease. The newer macrolides also show promise for the treatment of other NTM infections such as those caused by M. abscessus, M. fortuitum, M. chelonae, M. xenopi, M. marinum, M. haemophilum, and M. genavense. Rifabutin, a derivative of rifamycin S, is an effective agent for prophylaxis against disseminated MAC and may have utility for treatment of pulmonary and disseminated MAC disease. Interactions between clarithromycin and rifamycin may alter efficacy of the macrolide and enhance toxicity of rifabutin. Although therapy of many NTM infections remains difficult with somewhat unpredictable results, the introduction of newer drugs, particularly the macrolides, has appreciably improved a previously dismal outlook for successful therapy.
