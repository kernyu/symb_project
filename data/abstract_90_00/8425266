Hepatocyte resistance against inhibition of DNA synthesis by transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) was studied in vitro. Hepatocytes were isolated from rats that had received diethylnitrosamine (DEN) for 6 weeks. The effect of TGF-beta 1 and phenobarbital (PB) on DNA synthesis in different cell populations was studied using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation and placental glutathione S-transferase (GST-P) as markers. It was found that GST-P-positive cells were resistant to the growth inhibitory effect of TGF-beta 1 and PB, whereas GST-P-negative cells were inhibited. It is concluded that resistance to TGF-beta 1-dependent growth control may develop early during DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis.
