The dipeptide permease (Dpp) is one of three genetically distinct peptide-transport systems in enteric bacteria. Dpp also plays a role in chemotaxis towards peptides. We have devised three selections for dpp mutations based on resistance to toxic peptides (bacilysin, valine-containing peptides, and bialaphos). All dpp mutations mapped to a single chromosomal locus between 77 and 78 min in Salmonella typhimurium and at 79.2 min in Escherichia coli. Expression of dpp was constitutive in both species but the absolute level of expression varied widely between strains. At least in part this difference in expression levels is determined by cis-acting sequences. The dpp locus of E. coli was cloned. The first gene in the operon, dppA, encodes a periplasmic dipeptide-binding protein (DBP) required for dipeptide transport and chemotaxis. Downstream of dppA are other genes required for transport but not for chemotaxis. The dipeptide-binding protein was found to share 26.5% sequence identity with the periplasmic oligopeptide-binding protein OppA.
