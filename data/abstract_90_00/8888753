PURPOSE: Frequently recurrent leukemia is encountered in childhood and is usually resistant to multidrug therapy. We evaluated the efficacy of differentiation induction therapy in a child with leukemia. PATIENT AND METHODS: We administered all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) alone, and then a combination of low-dose 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (Ara-C), to a 7-year-old boy who had leukemia secondary to etoposide with chromosomal abnormality 11q23. RESULTS: The patient exhibited a good response to ATRA and had a complete remission after combination therapy of ATRA and low-dose Ara-C. CONCLUSION: Differentiation induction therapy with ATRA was effective in treating a patient with recurrence of leukemia without t(15;17) translocation, and which is resistant to conventional cytotoxic treatment.
