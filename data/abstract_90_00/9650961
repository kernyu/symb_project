Studies were conducted on a method of direct inoculation of MicroScan dried overnight and of rapid panels with positive aerobic blood cultures obtained from the BacT/Alert to determine antimicrobial susceptibilities. Inocula were limited to specimens that appeared unimicrobic on Gram stain. Results were compared to those obtained from panels inoculated following subculture. For 133 gram-negative bacilli, there were 94.7 and 93.5% categorical agreements between direct and standard methods for all drugs tested with overnight and rapid panels, respectively. For 104 gram-positive cocci, there were 93.2 and 93.1% categorical agreements for overnight and rapid panels, respectively. The major error (false resistance) rate for gram negatives was 1.4% for overnight versus 0.7% for rapid panels. The very major error (false susceptibility) rate was 2.7% for overnight versus 8.1% for rapid panels. The total error rates were 1.6% for overnight panels and 1.5% for rapid panels. The major error rates for gram-positive direct susceptibility tests were 2.6% for overnight and 2.5% for rapid panels. The very major error rates were 8.8 and 7.2% for overnight and rapid panels, respectively. Total error rates were 3.6% for overnight and rapid gram-positive panels. These findings suggest that susceptibility results obtained from directly inoculated gram-negative overnight panels have the greatest correlation to those obtained by standard methods. When discrepant results occur with direct-susceptibility testing, they are more likely to show false susceptibility than false resistance.
