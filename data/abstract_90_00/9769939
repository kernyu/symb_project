We described an in vitro 3-dimensional model to study the bactericidal activity of piperacillin (P), tazobactam (T) and amikacin (A) in combination against 5 strains of enterobacteria with different resistance patterns of beta-lactam antibiotics. A synergy was defined by calculation of sigma FBCP,T,A = BCp/MBCp + BCT/MBCT + BCA/MBCA and classic sigma FBCs for each double combination. The therapeutic value of each antibiotic was estimated by comparison of its bactericidal concentrations alone and in double or triple combination.
