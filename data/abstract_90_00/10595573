The resistance of mycobacteria to beta-lactam antibiotics is attributed to their ability to synthesize beta-lactamase. In our previous studies, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase-inhibitor combinations suppressed the growth of several mycobacteria in axenic cultures and ampicillin/sulbactam was bactericidal to Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv in vitro, and to Mycobacterium leprae multiplying in mouse foot-pads. Since both these organisms multiply in phagocytic cells in the host, it is important to know whether the drug combination is active against mycobacteria multiplying in macrophages. We tested the action of ampicillin/sulbactam against four potentially pathogenic (to humans or to animals) mycobacteria, M. simiae, M. haemophilum, M. avium, M. microti, when phagocytosed by mouse macrophages. Bacteria were exposed to monolayers of peritoneal macrophages harvested from BALB/c mice. Unphagocytosed bacilli were removed and three concentrations of ampicillin/sulbactam were tested. Optimum activity was observed at 100 mg/l which killed 58-97% of the mycobacteria within macrophages, as determined by the CFU. beta-Lactam/beta-lactamase-inhibitors, especially ampicillin/sulbactam, might provide an effective alternative therapy against infections caused by mycobacteria resistant to other drugs.
