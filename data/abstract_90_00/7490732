The major cause of viral resistance to the potent human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor nevirapine is the mutation substituting cysteine for tyrosine-181 in RT (Y181C RT). An evaluation, against Y181C RT, of previously described analogs of nevirapine revealed that the 2-chlorodipyridodiazepinone 16 is an effective inhibitor of this mutant enzyme. The detailed examination of the structure-activity relationship of 2-substituted dipyridodiazepinones presented below shows that combined activity against the wild-type and Y181C enzymes is achieved with aryl substituents at the 2-position of the tricyclic ring system. In addition, the substitution pattern at C-4, N-5, and N-11 of the dipyridodiazepinone ring system optimum for inhibition of both wild-type and Y181C RT is no longer the 4-methyl-11-cyclopropyl substitution preferred against the wild-type enzyme but rather the 5-methyl-11-ethyl (or 11-cyclopropyl) pattern. The more potent 2-substituted dipyridodiazepinones were evaluated against mutant RT enzymes (L100I RT, K103N RT, P236L RT, and E138K RT) that confer resistance to other non-nucleoside RT inhibitors, and compounds 42, 62, and 67, with pyrrolyl, aminophenyl, and aminopyridyl substituents, respectively, at the 2-position, were found to be effective inhibitors of these mutant enzymes also.
