We report a case of lung abscess caused by Eikenella corrodens and reviewed the literature. A 51-year-old man was hospitalized because of an infiltrative shadow in the left upper lung on chest X-ray. The patient was intravenously given CEZ (2 g/day) followed by CEZ (4 g/day) and AMK (200 mg/day). We nevertheless deteriorated and was subsequently treated with CTM (4 g/day) and LCM (6 g/day), and the shadow improved but remained. Only Eikenella corrodens was isolated from aspiration materials obtained from the resected lung. We examined the susceptibility of 60 strains of Eikenella corrodens to various antimicrobial against. The organisms were very susceptible to PCG, ABPC, PIPC, CTM, CTX and LMOX, but were all resistant to LCM, CLDM, GM and AMK.
