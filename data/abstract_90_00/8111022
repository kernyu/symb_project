We report here the isolation of cDNAs encoding two abscisic acid-responsive pea (Pisum sativum L.) proteins, ABR17 and ABR18, which are synthesized during late seed development in vivo. Southern blot analyses suggest that ABR17 cDNA corresponds to a single-copy gene, but ABR18 is one member of a family of closely related sequences in the pea genome. The deduced amino acid sequences of ABR17 and ABR18 cDNAs showed similarity to those of the pea disease resistance response proteins, to pathogenesis-related and to stress-induced proteins in other species and to the major birch pollen allergen Betv1.
