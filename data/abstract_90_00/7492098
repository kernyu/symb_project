Fluconazole was observed to inhibit sterol 14 alpha-demethylase in the human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, and accumulation of a ketosteroid product was associated with growth arrest. A novel mechanism(s) of azole and amphotericin B cross-resistance was identified, unrelated to changes in sterol biosynthesis, as previously identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Reduced cellular content of drug could account for the resistance phenotype, indicating the possible involvement of a mechanism similar to multidrug resistance observed in higher eukaryotes.
