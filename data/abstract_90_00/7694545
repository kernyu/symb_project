We have examined the resistance of Pseudomonas pseudomallei biofilm cells to ceftazidime and cotrimoxazole. A large number of these biofilm cells remained viable at 12 and at 24 h, except in the biofilm treated with 200 times the MIC of ceftazidime. The inherent resistance of P. pseudomallei biofilms to conventional antibiotics may explain the lack of success in the treatment of the chronic manifestations of this bacterial infection.
