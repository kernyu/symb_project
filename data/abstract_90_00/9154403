Questions and controversies involving many aspects of medical mycology have increased in recent years. Case histories are described in which fungal infection causes unexpected and atypical problems. Molecular techniques of diagnosis need to be used alongside traditional culture methods. Increased drug use has led to genuine concerns and differing views regarding the definition and development of resistance by fungi. The use and value of combinational antifungal therapy and the employment of immunomodulatory agents concomitant with antimycotics have been debated. Nonetheless, good standards have been developed in the testing of antifungal agents. These, together with the commercial viability of antifungal drugs and hence increased interest in their development, mean that although we have entered the golden age of mycology we have also entered the golden age of antifungal therapy.
