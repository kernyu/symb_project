Using the dynamic chequerboard technique, we confirmed that rifampicin produces a synergistic bactericidal effect when combined with amikacin or netilmicin. Adaptive resistance was suppressed when rifampicin was added to aminoglycoside after, but not during, first exposure to amikacin or netilmicin. The effect of rifampicin on adaptive resistance could account for the synergy between rifampicin and aminoglycosides.
