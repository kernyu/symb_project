A variant of the vga(A) gene (1,575 bp), encoding an ATP-binding cassette protein conferring resistance to streptogramin A and related antibiotics, was cloned from the chromosome of a Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolate and sequenced. The sequence of the variant was similar to that of the vga(A) gene (83.2% identity). However, the G+C content of the variant (35.6%) was higher than that of vga(A) (29%) and there was no cross hybridization between vga(A) and the variant at high stringency (> or =60 degrees C), the highest temperature at which a signal was detected being 55 degrees C. Unlike previous reports for vga(A) and vga(B), the variant of vga(A) may be present in multiple copies in the genome. These copies are chromosomal in some isolates and both chromosomal and plasmid-borne in others. Nucleotide sequences hybridizing at 65 degrees C with the vga(A) variant were found in all the staphylococcal strains harboring plasmids carrying both vga(B) and vat(B), which also encode resistance to streptogramin A.
