The aims of this study were to evaluate the impact of a fermented milk product containing viable Enterococcus faecium on human intestinal microflora and to evaluate any risk of development of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Twenty Danish and 20 Swedish healthy volunteers were given 150 ml of the fermented milk product once daily, equivalent to a daily dose of 4.5 x 10(9) to 7.5 x 10(9) CFU E. faecium, for 10 d. Half of the volunteers also received 125 mg vancomycin orally q.i.d. for 10 d. Faecal samples were collected on day 0 before intake, on day 10 directly after end of intake and on day 31, 3 weeks after the end of the experiment. There was a significant increase in the total number of enterococci on day 10 (p < 0.01) in the group receiving only the E. faecium supplement, but 3 weeks later the level was as before intake. In the vancomycin group, the total number of enterococci was reduced on day 10 (p < 0.01) but had increased on day 31 (p < 0.01) in relation to day 0. In none of the Swedish and 4 of the Danish volunteers, VRE were sporadically detected, but without relation to intake of the probiotic or vancomycin. In healthy young Danish individuals the VRE carrier rate tended to be higher than previously found.
