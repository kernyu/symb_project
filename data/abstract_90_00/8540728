Certain new fluoroquinolones have high activity against enterococci. Against Enterococcus faecalis (n = 18), MICs at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited were as follows (in micrograms per milliliter): clinafloxacin, 0.125; CI-990, 0.5; and PD 138312, 0.25 (compared with 1 microgram/ml for ciprofloxacin and 2 micrograms/ml for ofloxacin). Strains producing beta-lactamase or that were vancomycin resistant or resistant to high-level gentamicin were not quinolone cross-resistant. The drugs were bactericidal and were unaffected by 50% human serum. Oral efficacies (in milligrams per kilogram of body weight for 50% protective doses) in lethal mouse infections with quinolone-susceptible strains were 4.3 to 24 for clinafloxacin, 7.2 to 39 for CI-990, 7.2 to 76 for PD 138312, and 41 to > 100 for ciprofloxacin; when the drugs were given subcutaneously, the order was similar and values ranged from 1.1 to 12.5. Clinafloxacin, CI-990, and PD 138312 may have therapeutic potential in systemic enterococcal infections in humans.
