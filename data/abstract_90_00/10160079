Selection of macrolide antibiotics for formulary addition can be a difficult task, with the increasing availability of new agents as well as the numerous differences in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of available agents. Nonetheless, appropriate evaluation of the important characteristics of macrolide antibiotics should allow selection of the most cost-effective agents for formulary addition. Most importantly, differences in antimicrobial activity and efficacy, product formulation, tolerability and cost should be carefully considered when making formulary decisions. Notably, evidence from in vitro studies and clinical trials indicate differences between the macrolide antibiotics, especially in the management of a variety of opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients. For selected clinical situations, it may be important to select an effective agent available in both oral and intravenous formulations, especially in severe pneumonia caused by Legionella spp. In addition, the availability of generic formulations should be considered for its potential to reduce cost. Comparative drug costs, as well as costs associated with noncompliance, should also be evaluated carefully. Dosage regimens should also be considered, as shorter durations of therapy and less frequent dose administration may lead to increased compliance and thereby improved effectiveness and economic efficiency.
