Microbiological studies indicate that stimulating the multiplication of Mycobacteria tuberculosis, electric UHF fields at 40 and 70 W make them available for drug exposure despite drug resistance. Unlike the electric UHF fields, MILI has a direct inhibitory effect on Mycobacteria tuberculosis that are sensitive and resistant to antibiotic drugs, by potentiating their action. In the clinical setting, chemotherapy in combination with electric UHF fields and MILI therapy reduces the time of disappearance of clinical signs of the disease, infiltration resolution, bacterial isolation, and decay cavity closure.
