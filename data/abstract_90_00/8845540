OBJECTIVE: To review the current knowledge on RP 59500 (quinupristin/dalfopristin, Synercid), a new streptogramin antibiotic, with respect to its pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, mechanism of resistance, and in vitro inhibitory and bactericidal activity. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search using keywords RP 59500, pristinamycin, virginiamycin, and streptogramin was performed. Relevant abstracts presented at recent scientific conferences also were consulted. STUDY SELECTION: Because RP 59500 is a relatively new investigational agent, relevant in vitro and animal studies were selected. All available human studies were included as well. DATA EXTRACTION: Data from in vitro and in vivo studies were included, with particular emphasis on human studies. DATA SYNTHESIS: RP 59500 is a new injectable streptogramin antibiotic consisting of a mixture o 2 synergistic pristinamycin compounds. RP 59500 possesses in vitro inhibitory and bactericidal activity against most isolates of gram-positive organisms including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, selected gram-negative bacteria, and most anaerobic organisms. Based on preliminary data, the drug appears to be metabolized rapidly and extensively while exhibiting a significant postantibiotic effect. Data from ongoing clinical trials suggests that RP 59500 is well-tolerated except for mild injection site irritations. However, before the role of RP 59500 within the vast armamentarium of antimicrobials can be elucidated, additional studies need to be conducted to document its clinical efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Based on in vitro susceptibility testing, in vivo studies, and preliminary clinical data, RP 59500 may be an alternative to the glycopeptides, especially for inherently resistant organisms. Further studies are needed to confirm this agent's in vitro activity and to establish its clinical efficacy.
