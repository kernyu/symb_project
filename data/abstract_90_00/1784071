Results of the treatment of 5 cases of males with uncomplicated gonoccocal urethritis using levofloxacin (LVFX, DR-3355), the L-type optical isomer of ofloxacin (OFLX), were compared with those treated with OFLX itself. Three hundred mg/day of LVFX or 600 mg/day of OFLX was given to each patient for 5 days. Both drugs showed excellent clinical results in all the patients. When MICs of the 2 drugs were compared against 57 isolated strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae including 3 penicillinase-producing N. gonorrhoeae, it was found that MICs of LVFX were approximately one half of those of OFLX.
