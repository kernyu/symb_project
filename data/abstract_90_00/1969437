Three chlorhexidine-resistant strains, two of Achromobacter xylosoxidans, one of Pseudomonas cepacia, were isolated from clinical sources. The three strains showed cross-resistance to benzethonium chloride, benzalkonium chloride and alkyldiaminoethylglycine. Resistance persisted after treatment of the strains with acridine orange (12.5 mg-25 mg l-1). Conjugation to appropriate recipients of Escherichia coli was unsuccessful and plasmid DNA could not be detected. These results suggest that plasmids do not play a role in resistance to multiple disinfectants in the strains of bacteria studied.
