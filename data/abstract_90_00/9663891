OBJECTIVE: Despite many improvements in connectology, peritonitis continues to be a major burden in peritoneal dialysis. Because of the high variety in causative organisms and of the differences in their sensitivity patterns, surveillance of the epidemiology of peritonitis and the appropriate adaptation of the therapy are necessary. This study was performed to evaluate the influence of the nature of causative bacteria on the effectiveness of empirical treatment protocols. Based on this information, a new empiric treatment protocol was proposed. SETTING: Peritoneal dialysis program of a university hospital. DESIGN: All episodes of peritonitis at the University Hospital Gent between 1 January 1994 and 31 December 1996 were analyzed retrospectively. Results of microbiological cultures, microscopic evaluation of dialysate, and clinical course were noted. RESULTS: During 1240 patient-months at risk, 50 episodes of peritonitis with identifiable responsible bacteria were observed. Gram-positive organisms were cultured in 34 episodes, and gram-negative organisms were found in 16 episodes. No responsible organism could be identified in 25 additional cases. Resistance to methicillin was registered in 33% of the cultures with staphylococci. There was no resistance to vancomycin. A new empirical treatment protocol was proposed, using a single dose of vancomycin and gentamicin intraperitoneally the first day, followed by oral treatment with ciprofloxacin. With this protocol, a 96% coverage rate is obtained, as opposed to a 78% coverage by using the Ad Hoc Advisory Committee protocol (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Individual centers should continue to monitor the epidemiology of peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis and the epidemiology of the causative organisms and their sensitivity patterns in order to adapt general guidelines into a center-tailored empirical treatment protocol.
