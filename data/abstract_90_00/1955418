The effects of some antibiotics and biocides on the conjugative transfer of the Staphylococcus aureus gentamicin resistance plasmid pWG613 were investigated. Gentamicin and vancomycin were found to stimulate plasmid transfer frequency by 10- to 20-fold whereas methicillin and three inhibitors of protein synthesis each reduced it by various degrees. Most significantly, mupirocin inhibited plasmid transfer frequency by more than 1000-fold. All the biocides tested (cationic agents, sodium dodecyl sulphate and an organomercurial) reduced plasmid transfer.
