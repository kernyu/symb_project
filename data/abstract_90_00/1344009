Characteristics of peritoneal macrophages recovered from mice infected with two attenuated strains SER and Jena of Salmonella enteritidis were compared. Strong resistance against lethal infection with a virulent strain 116-54 of S. enteritidis was seen in a group of mice immunized with strain SER, but not in a group of mice immunized with strain Jena as well as in a control group. Peritoneal macrophages from mice immunized with strain SER showed an enhanced Salmonella-killing activity, an increased generation of O2- and an increased expression of Ia antigen on 7 to 14 days after infection when compared with those from mice immunized with strain Jena and thioglycollate(TG)-elicited macrophages as a control. The bacterial number of strain Jena in organs decreased more rapidly than that of strain SER after day 4 of infection. These observations suggest that the survival of an attenuated Salmonella bacilli at reticulo-endothelium is essential to increase of their activities of macrophages. Macrophages from mice injected with recombinant interferon(IFN)-gamma for 3 days induced the activated stage of the same characteristics as noted in activated macrophages from mice immunized with strain SER. Effect of oxygen intermediates (OI) scavengers such as superoxide dismutase and catalase on Salmonella-killing activity of activated macrophages was not seen at all. These results suggest that an increased generation of OI may be not primarily responsible for the ability to inhibit the intracellular growth of a virulent strain of S. enteritidis in macrophages activated by immunization with live, attenuated strains and injection with rIFN-gamma.
