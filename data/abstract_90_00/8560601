Enteric fever is still a common health problem in many countries, especially in children. Thus a ten-year retrospective study was carried out to evaluate the clinical and laboratory properties of enteric fever and the incidence of antimicrobial resistance in children. Throughout the past 10 years, Salmonella was isolated in 105 patients by blood culturing, 27 of which were Salmonella typhi. Most of the patients were above the age of two. Besides the typical symptoms and signs of enteric fever, 29.2% of the patients had some neurologic findings. Besides, 68.5% had elevated liver enzymes while only 44.4% had hepatomegaly with or without splenomegaly. Anemia was present in 44%, leukopenia in 16% and leukocytosis in 11.1% of the cases. The emergence of antimicrobial resistance during the last five years against ampicillin, chloramphenicol and trimetoprim-sulfamethoxazole has created a challenge in treating these infections.
