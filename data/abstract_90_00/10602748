We examined the antimicrobial susceptibilities of 85 Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates, classified according to the presence of amino acid substitutions in the GyrA and ParC proteins, to 12 fluoroquinolones and 7 other antibiotics. Sitafloxacin and HSR-903 showed excellent activity against N. gonorrhoeae, including strains with both GyrA and ParC substitutions. Among the strains with various GyrA substitutions, strains with a serine-91-to-phenylalanine mutation required the highest MICs of all of the fluoroquinolones tested and were cross-resistant to structurally unrelated beta-lactams.
