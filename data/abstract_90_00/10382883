Ten clinical isolates of high-level gentamicin-resistant (HLGR) Enterococcus faecium, collected from six hospitals throughout the UK, were studied to determine whether HLGR was attributed to widespread dissemination of a single plasmid or whether different plasmid types were implicated in the dissemination of this phenotype. HLGR was attributed to the presence of the AAC6'-APH2" bifunctional aminoglycoside modifying enzyme. The aac6'-aph2" gene was present on a 70 kb plasmid in all ten isolates. Conjugation studies indicated that the HLGR marker could transfer with varying frequency, with or without the associated 70 kb plasmid. Detailed molecular genetic analysis suggested that four of the isolates harboured a transposon similar to Tn5281, originally identified in Enterococcus faecalis strain HH22 isolated in the USA. The UK transposon, however, lacked the two symmetrically located HaeIII sites found in Tn5281. The six remaining isolates appeared to have a Tn5281-truncated structure in which the aac6'-aph2" gene is flanked by an IS256 element at the 5' end. Further studies with nine restriction endonucleases showed that the aac6'-aph2" gene was associated with two different plasmid types in E. faecium. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis identified three different patterns. The four E. faecium isolates harbouring the Tn5281-like structure were indistinguishable from each other, while the remaining six isolates exhibited two distinct PFGE patterns. This is the first study to indicate that there is heterogeneity among the plasmids that confer the HLGR phenotype in E. faecium isolates in the UK and to report on the presence of a transposon, similar to Tn5281, in E. faecium harbouring the aac6'-aph2" gene.
