The sensitivity of 701 Gram negative strains, representing 16 species or bacterial genera, towards 4 antiseptics (cetrimide, chlorhexidine, hexachlorophene, mercuric chloride) and 6 antibiotics (ampicillin, streptomycin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, tetracycline) was analysed. For 3 antiseptics (cetrimide, chlorhexidine, mercuric chloride) minimal inhibitory concentration distribution showed strains to be heterogeneous, particularly in the group Pseudomonas. Most strains were resistant to antibiotics. The statistical analysis of correlation showed positive resistance links between antiseptics (cetrimide, chlorhexidine, hexachlorophene) or between these antiseptics and antibiotics for S marcescens and Alcaligenes. Many strains proved resistant, at the same time, to mercuric chloride and to several antibiotics. These associations of resistance suggest either a common mechanism of action or a crossed resistance.
