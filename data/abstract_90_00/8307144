The recurrent cholera epidemic in Angola has been occurring in the rainy hot season since 1987. About 350 cases were registered in the Luanda province in the first quarter of 1992. Out of 110 analysed cases, 13 were positive for V. parahaemolyticus and 57 were positive for multiresistant V. cholerae O1. Such strains were also isolated in the Bengo river, which feeds the Luanda water supply.
