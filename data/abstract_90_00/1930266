The present study aimed to investigate the role of protein kinase C (PKC), the phosphatidylinositol pathway (PI) and cytosolic calcium in multidrug resistance (MDR) in human ovarian carcinoma cells. Binding of the phorbol ester 13,14-dibutyrate (PDBu) was 3-fold higher in resistant A2780AD versus sensitive A2780 cells indicating increased PKC activity. However, when inositol phosphate production (IP) was measured in quiescent cells similar total IP release was seen in both lines suggesting no difference in the basal turnover of PI. Non-specific stimulation of the PI pathway was achieved with the calcium ionophore A23187 which increased IP production in a time- and dose-dependent fashion in both cell lines but was significantly less effective in A2780AD. The PI pathway was investigated further using the agonists aluminium fluoride, serum and bombesin but these agents failed to elicit a response. The effect of a wide range of Adriamycin concentrations on the PI cycle and cell growth was also studied. Intracellular calcium was measured with the fluorescent dye fura-2-pentaacetoxymethylester (Fura-2). A23187 produced a rise in cytosolic calcium in A2780 and A2780AD but from a level 3-fold lower in the unstimulated resistant cell line. The dose responsiveness of this effect was greater but irreversible in A2780AD cells. Collectively these results imply that alterations in PI turnover appear not to be responsible for the differences in PDBu binding and calcium handling observed between A2780 and A2780AD and suggests only a minor role for the PI cycle in the maintenance of MDR in human ovarian cancer cell lines.
