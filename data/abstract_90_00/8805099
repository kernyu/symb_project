Drug-resistant mutants of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) emerge during treatment with various reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. However, the virological nature and pathogenic importance of these mutants have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we have examined HIV-1 mutants resistant to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) and nonnucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs) for their infectivity, RT activity, and replication in MT-4 cells. Although the infectivity of AZT- and NNRTI-resistant mutants was similar, the RT activity of AZT-resistant mutants was much higher than that of NNRTI-resistant mutants and their wild types. Furthermore, the RT activity of NNRTI-resistant mutants was significantly lower than that of the wild types. In contrast, the replication of NNRTI-resistant mutants was found to be greater than that of AZT-resistant mutants and the wild types. When HIV-1 proviral DNA (cDNA) synthesis was examined by PCR in MT-4 cells infected with the wild type, AZT-resistant mutant, or NNRTI-resistant mutant, the PCR signal of the NNRTI-resistant mutant was found to be much higher than those of the wild type and AZT-resistant mutant. These results suggest that the drug-resistant mutants differ from their corresponding wild types not only in drug sensitivity but also in other virological properties.
