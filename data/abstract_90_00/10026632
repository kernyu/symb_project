Enterococci are the second most common cause of nosocomial infections in the United States, and primarily cause urinary tract, surgical wound, soft tissue, and bloodstream infections. Patients at greater risk of acquiring VRE are those with lengthy hospital stays, those who have undergone multi-antibiotic treatment, surgical patients (transplants, cardiothoracic, and intra-abdominal), and the immunocompromised. Because the mode of transmission is via the hands of health care workers, good handwashing technique is key to prevention and control.
