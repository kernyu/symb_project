We have used the toxic non-metabolizable glucose/mannose analogue 2-deoxyglucose to isolate a comprehensive collection of mutants of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system from Streptococcus salivarius. To increase the range of possible mutations, we isolated spontaneous mutants on different media containing 2-deoxyglucose and various metabolizable sugars, either lactose, melibiose, galactose or fructose. We found that the frequency at which 2-deoxyglucose-resistant mutants were isolated varied according to the growth substrate. The highest frequency was obtained with the combination galactose and 2-deoxyglucose and was 15-fold higher than the rate observed with the mixture melibiose and 2-deoxyglucose, the combination that gave the lowest frequency. By combining results from: (i) Western blot analysis of IIIMan, a specific component of the phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose phosphotransferase system in S. salivarius; (ii) rocket immunoelectrophoresis of HPr and EI, the two general energy-coupling proteins of the phosphotransferase system; and (iii) from gene sequencing, mutants could be assigned to seven classes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
