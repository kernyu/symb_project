Two similar strains of a coryneform bacterium were isolated from human clinical material. Both strains were resistant to vancomycin but susceptible to teicoplanin. Detailed biochemical, chemotaxonomical, and molecular genetic investigations revealed that both isolates were members of a hitherto undescribed species of genus Aureobacterium. The name Aureobacterium resistens sp. nov. is proposed for the new bacterium and the type strain is CCUG 38312.
