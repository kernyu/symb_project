We found that the previously reported SS-B drug-supersusceptible mutant of Salmonella typhimurium (S. Sukupolvi, M. Vaara, I. M. Helander, P. Viljanen, and P. H. Makela, J. Bacteriol. 159:704-712, 1984) had a mutation in the acrAB operon. Comparison of this mutant with its parent strain and with an AcrAB-overproducing strain showed that the activity of the AcrAB efflux pump often produced significant resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in the complete absence of beta-lactamase. The effect of AcrAB activity on resistance was more pronounced with agents containing more lipophilic side chains, suggesting that such compounds were better substrates for this pump. This correlation is consistent with the hypothesis that only those molecules that become at least partially partitioned into the lipid bilayer of the cytoplasmic membrane are captured by the AcrAB pump. According to this mechanism, the pump successfully excretes even those beta-lactams that fail to traverse the cytoplasmic membrane, because these compounds are likely to become partitioned into the outer leaflet of the bilayer. Even the compounds with lipophilic side chains were shown to penetrate across the outer membrane relatively rapidly, if the pump was inactivated genetically or physiologically. The exclusion of such compounds, exemplified by nafcillin, from cells of the wild-type S. typhimurium was previously interpreted as the result of poor diffusion across the outer membrane (H. Nikaido, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 433:118-132, 1976), but it is now recognized as the consequence of efficient pumping out of entering antibiotics by the active efflux process.
