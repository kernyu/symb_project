To determine whether there is mutual resistance to avermectin and milbemycin anthelmintics, ivermectin and moxidectin sheep drenches were tested against ivermectin-resistant and susceptible isolates of Ostertagia circumcincta and Trichostrongylus colubriformis in sheep. None of the isolates had been exposed to moxidectin previously. The dosage of ivermectin required to remove 95 per cent of the ivermectin-resistant O circumcincta and T colubriformis were 23 times and six times larger, respectively, than the dosages required to remove the same percentage of susceptible isolates. The dosages of moxidectin required to remove 95 per cent of the ivermectin-resistant O circumcincta and T colubriformis were 31 times and nine times larger, respectively, than the dosages required to remove the same percentage of susceptible isolates. It is concluded that the worms resistant to ivermectin were also resistant to moxidectin.
