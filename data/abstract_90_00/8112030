The detection of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae was assessed by six different methods: agar dilution, oxacillin screen by disk diffusion, E-test, and three overnight microdilution test methods that included commercial panels from MicroScan and Micro Media and in-house-made conventional panels using a commercial Haemophilus test medium (HTM) broth. Of the 52 pneumococcal isolates tested, 12 were resistant, 16 were relatively resistant, and 24 were susceptible to penicillin as defined by the reference agar dilution method. The oxacillin screen detected as resistant all 28 resistant and relatively resistant strains. The percentage of penicillin-resistant isolates detected by each minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test method was as follows: E-test (100%), Micro Media (75%), MicroScan (0%), and HTM (0%). With the relatively resistant isolates, the detection percentage was as follows: E-test (88%), Micro Media (94%), MicroScan (69%), and HTM (69%). In conclusion, the E-test and Micro Media MIC tests are acceptable confirmatory tests for detecting penicillin resistance among S. pneumoniae isolates.
