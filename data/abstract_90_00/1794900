A total of 150 strains of E. coli isolated from faecal samples of normal population (Group I), hospital personnel (Group II) and hospitalised patients (Group III) were studied for the transfer of R-plasmids. Auto-transferable R-plasmids were observed in 72.0, 82.0 and 80.0 per cent of groups I, II and III respectively. 77.0 per cent strains were typable. 04 was the most common serotype found in groups I and II, 0134 in group III.
