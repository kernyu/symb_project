The in vitro activity of LY333328 was compared with those of vancomycin and teicoplanin against 425 gram-positive clinical isolates, including a variety of multiply resistant strains. LY333328 at </=4 microgram/ml inhibited all microorganisms tested, including methicillin- and teicoplanin-resistant staphylococci, glycopeptide-resistant enterococci, penicillin- and multiply resistant pneumococci, and viridans and beta-hemolytic streptococci.
