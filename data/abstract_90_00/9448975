Fever in the critical care unit (CCU) may be on an infectious or noninfectious basis. Many noninfectious disorders have clinical and laboratory features mimicking infections.

Selection of appropriate antibiotic therapy is straightforward once the likely source of sepsis is determined. This article provides a clinical diagnostic approach.
