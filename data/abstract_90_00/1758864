The results of a study of a new synthetic drug dimephosphon used as a pathogenetic means in the treatment of experimental tuberculosis are presented. Dimephosphon was found to be responsible for both the in vivo and in vitro decrease of the degree of MBT resistance to rifampicin. The findings of macroscopic, histologic and bacteriologic examinations demonstrated a significant increase in the effectiveness of antituberculous therapy. Dimephosphon monotherapy in mice elicited manifested stimulation of peritoneal macrophages: increase in O2- production, and decline in extracellular 5-nucleotidase activity. Nemolysine-synthetic cellular splenic activity in mice rose essentially. No direct stimulating influence of dimephosphon on functional macrophage activity in vitro was found.
