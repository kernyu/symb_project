Recent results from human clinical trials have established the critical role of HIV protease inhibitors in the treatment of acquired immune-deficiency syndrome (AIDS). However, the emergence of viral resistance, demanding treatment protocols, and adverse side effects have exposed the urgent need for a second generation of HIV protease inhibitors. The continued exploration of our hydroxylaminepentanamide (HAPA) transition-state isostere series of HIV protease inhibitors, which initially resulted in the identification of Crixivan (indinavir sulfate, MK-639, L-735,524), has now yielded MK-944a (L-756,423). This compound is potent, is selective, and competitively inhibits HIV-1 PR with a K(i) value of 0.049 nM. It stops the spread of the HIV(IIIb)-infected MT4 lymphoid cells at 25.0-50.0 nM, even in the presence of alpha(1) acid glycoprotein, human serum albumin, normal human serum, or fetal bovine serum. MK-944a has a longer half-life in several animal models (rats, dogs, and monkeys) than indinavir sulfate and is currently in advanced human clinical trials.
