S-2720 and other members of the quinoline/quinoxaline class of HIV-1-specific nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) select for a glycine to glutamate substitution at residue 190 (Gly 190 Glu) of the reverse transcriptase (RT), when drug-resistant viruses are generated in cell culture. This mutation has not been described to appear upon selection for resistant viral variants using derivatives of any other class of NNRTIs. Notably, the RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity of the Gly 190 Glu mutant enzyme is drastically diminished with respect to the wild-type RT. We describe here the effects of other amino acid substitutions at position 190 of the RT that were introduced by using site-directed mutagenesis. Polymerase activities and sensitivities to inhibition by a number of NNRTIs were determined for the different RT mutants. In general, an inverse correlation was found between the enzymatic activity and increasing length of the side chain, whereas the size of the residue and the level of resistance to NNRTIs appeared to be positively related. Double mutants, which contain the Gly 190 Glu mutation together with substitutions that confer resistance to other RT inhibitors, were all shown to possess severely diminished polymerase activity.
