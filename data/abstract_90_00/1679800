The peritoneal cavity of patients undergoing CAPD is critically immunocompromised and infectious peritonitis is the most important complication of the technique. Nevertheless, recent research into the epidemiology and pathogenesis of infections caused by the most important microorganisms has enabled significant reductions in peritonitis rates to be made. Peritonitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa can be prevented by eliminating their principal source, an infected Tenckhoff catheter wound. The source of infection for coagulase-negative staphylococci and other pseudomonads cannot be eliminated, but peritonitis caused by these organisms may be prevented by interrupting their routes of entry into the peritoneal cavity. The identification of host factors predictive of enhanced susceptibility to infectious peritonitis offers the further possibility of prevention by immunological approaches. Although the main difficulties surrounding the diagnosis of infective peritonitis have been clarified, approximately 20% of episodes remain culture-negative, with multifactorial aetiology. Initial (empirical) combination antibiotic therapy can be both appropriate and effective in approximately 85% of cases. Intraperitoneal monotherapy with fluoroquinolones has been equally successful, and these agents may prove effective by the oral route, offering considerable advantages in cost and convenience. Approximately 5% of episodes of bacterial peritonitis are unresponsive to antibiotic therapy. These cases may be conveniently managed by the technique of Tenckhoff catheter removal and replacement at a single operation.
