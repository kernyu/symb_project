A total of 39 Salmonella cultures isolated from raw minced beef and chicken (gizzard, liver, and heart) samples in Addis Ababa were examined for susceptibility to a group of 10 selected antimicrobials. 34 isolates (87.2%) were resistant to one or more antibiotics. The antibiotics to which isolated Salmonella strains were most often fully resistant included nitrofurantoin (48.7%), furazolidone (48.7%) and streptomycin (46.2%). Only 4 antimicrobials (gentamycin, kanamycin, rifampicin and sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim) were effective against all Salmonella isolates with the exception of 2 which were intermediate in resistance to kanamycin (1) and sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim (1). 77.8% of the S. Enteritidis strains showed multiple resistance to up to four antibiotics followed by S. Typhimurium (60.0%) and S. Dublin (33.3%). The high level of antibiotic resistance of foodborne Salmonella isolates in the study area is an indication of indiscriminate and continuous use of subtherapeutic doses of antibiotics in animals.
