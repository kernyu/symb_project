A model system capable of investigating immunological changes was first established in Babesia rodhaini infected mice with an aid of a drug, diminazene diaceturate (DD). Intraperitoneal (ip) inoculation with B. rodhaini resulted in acute death in euthymic (nu/+) and athymic (nu/nu) BALB/c mice. Treatment with DD at an early stage of infection saved both mice from acute death. Parasitemia recurred in some of them but resulted in death only in nu/nu mice. A re-challenge with 10(5) parasitized erythrocytes (PE) on the surviving mice on day 28 post infection revealed resistance in nu/+ but not in nu/nu mice. The results suggested a participation of the thymus in the protective mechanisms. Immunological changes were then observed on nu/+ and nu/nu mice which were inoculated ip with 10(4)PE and treated with the drug, and then challenged with 10(5)PE ip on day 28. An antibody response was measured with immediate reaction by footpad injection of a soluble antigen of B. rodhaini and by ELISA of serum antibody using the antigen and protein A, on day 10 and later, and further a pronounced response was detected after re-challenge in nu/+ mice. No response was detected by ELISA in nu/nu mice. Delayed footpad reaction was seen in nu/+ mice by day 14 and later but it was suppressed after the re-challenge.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
