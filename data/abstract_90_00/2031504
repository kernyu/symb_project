Among 68 patients with resistant multiple myeloma, alpha-interferon was combined with either the VAD regimen for those in relapse, or high-dose dexamethasone for those who had never responded. Neither the response rate nor the survival time improved in comparison with similar treatments without interferon. Results affirmed no benefit with added interferon in myeloma patients with advanced disease resistant to standard therapies. Certain prognostic features for low likelihood of response and for short survival identified patients who should be considered early for intensive therapies that require bone marrow or blood stem cell support.
