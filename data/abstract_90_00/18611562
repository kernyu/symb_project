Recent in-vitro test results showed that in Seoul (Korea) aerobic Gram-negative bacilli are often resistant to ampicillin and to the first-generation cephalosporins, but chloramphenicol-resistant Salmonella typhi are extremely rare. Almost all isolates of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, 49% of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and 31% of Haemophilus influenzae were beta-lactamase producers. Seventhy-two percent of pneumococci were penicillin G resistant and 62% of staphylococci were methicillin resistant. Among the Enterococcus faecium, 59% were resistant to high-level gentamicin, but glycopeptide-resistant isolates were not found. Thirty-eight percent and 5% of Bacteroides fragilis were resistant to clindamycin and cefoxitin, respectively. In conclusion, antimicrobial-resistant bacteria are prevalent in Korea.
