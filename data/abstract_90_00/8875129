Therapy with antimicrobial combinations has been used as long as antimicrobials have been available. Combinations of antibiotics are often used to take advantage of different mechanisms of action and/or toxicity profiles. Well established indications for combination antimicrobial therapy include: (a) empirical treatment of life-threatening infections; (b) treatment of polymicrobial infections; (c) prevention of the emergence of bacterial resistance; and (d) for synergism. Disadvantages of combination therapy include: (a) increased expense; (b) increased risk of adverse effects; (c) antagonism; and (d) superinfection. Combination antimicrobial therapy should be considered for the treatment of serious Gram-negative infections caused by Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens, and certain Gram-positive infections caused by Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp. Selection of agents should be dependent upon local susceptibility patterns, clinical experience, site of infection, potential toxicities and cost.
