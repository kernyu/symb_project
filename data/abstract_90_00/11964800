Studies published within the past year have highlighted the potential morbidity associated with polyomaviruses and novel herpesviruses (e.g. human herpesvirus-6, 7 and -8). Although antiviral therapy has not been shown to be effective for polyomaviruses, attempts at management of human herpesvirus-6 and -8 infections with antiviral agents appear anecdotally promising. Bacterial infections remain the most frequently occurring infections in transplant recipients, and the challenges that face the transplant care providers pertain to a striking rise in antimicrobial resistance among these pathogens. Effective prophylaxis and management of invasive mould infections continue to be the focus of clinical studies, but an optimal approach remains elusive.
