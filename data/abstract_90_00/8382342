Thirty-three insertions of transposon Tn10 delta 16 delta 17 into genes involved in the control of rod cell shape were isolated in Salmonella typhimurium by the characteristic glossy appearance of colonies composed of spherical cells. Genetic tests demonstrated that 25 (76%) were insertions in the rodA gene, 7 (21%) were mre mutants, and 1 (3%) was a divD mutant. No insertion in the pbpA gene were found. Insertions in cell shape genes only appeared when strains displaying resistance to mecillinam (not caused by beta-lactamase production) were employed. Neither rodA nor mre insertions could be transduced to wild-type strains but they were normally accepted by mecillinam-resistant derivatives and by cya and crp mutants, which, unlike the corresponding Escherichia coli strains, did not display resistance to mecillinam. On the other hand, the divD insertion could be efficiently transduced to any strain. It is concluded that the rodA, mre, and divD genes are involved in the control of rod cell shape but, in addition, the RodA and Mre products perform some function(s) that is essential for wild-type cells but dispensable for some mecillinam-resistant strains, and for cya and crp mutants.
