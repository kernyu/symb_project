In vitro susceptibilities of 4,208 enterococci (83% Enterococcus faecalis isolates, 13.6% Enterococcus faecium isolates, and 3.4% isolates of other species) from patients in 27 European countries towards 16 antibiotics were determined. High-level resistance to gentamicin varied by country (range, 1 to 49%; mean, 22.6% +/- 12. 3%) and per species (19.7% E. faecalis isolates, 13.6% E. faecium isolates, 3.4% by other species). Vancomycin resistance was detected in 0.06% E. faecalis, 3.8% E. faecium, and 19.1% isolates of other species. All enterococci were susceptible to LY 333328 and everninomicin, and 25% of E. faecalis isolates and 85% of other enterococci were susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin. The MIC of moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin for ciprofloxacin-susceptible E. faecalis at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited was 0.25 to 0.5 microg/ml.
