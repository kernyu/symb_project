Patients with cancer cachexia exhibit increased glucose flux and lactate production in skeletal muscle. The aim of this study was to examine the direct effect of cancer cell-conditioned media on glucose metabolism in L6 myoblasts. Media from PANC-1 and Colo 320 cells caused a marked time-dependent and concentration-dependent increase of 2-deoxyglucose uptake in GLUT-4 transfected L6 myoblasts. This effect was greater than maximal acute stimulation by insulin and the effect of insulin was additive. Glucose utilization and lactate production increased in parallel to glucose uptake. The effect was inhibited by the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide and the glucose transport inhibitor, cytochalasin B. The bioactive factor had a molecular weight of approximately 5,000 and the biological activity was destroyed by proteinase K digestion. Radioimmunoassay and immunoneutralization studies indicated the major factor involved is not TNFalpha, IL-1beta, insulin, IGF-I or IGF-II. Further purification and characterization are needed to reveal the identity of this novel factor or factors which may have other metabolic effects that contribute to the cancer cachexia and insulin resistance.
