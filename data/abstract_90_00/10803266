An analysis was carried out of the microbiological investigations of clinical material samples obtained from the patients of two oncology centres belonging to the Warsaw Oncology Centre. Microorganisms cultured from urine, blood, catheters, smears of wounds and other materials were analysed. From 4839 clinical material samples from the Ursynow centre 1755 bacterial strains were isolated. From 423 samples from the centre in Wawelska Street 171 strains were obtained. In infections of patients from the centres the number of Gram-positive cocci was twice that of Gram-negative rods. In the investigated clinical material S. aureus was the most frequently isolated Gram-positive coccus, while E. coli was the most frequent species among Gram-negative bacteria. In the infections of oncological patients a considerable frequency was noted of yeast-like fungi, especially C. albicans. Particularly disquieting was the increasing number of isolates of C. glabrata and C. krusei strains resistant to fluconazole.
