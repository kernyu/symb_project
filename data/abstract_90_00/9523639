A dermatophyte-like fungus was isolated from skin biopsies of three different species of captive chameleon in which fungal elements had been observed by histologic examination. An adult Parson's chameleon (Chamaeleo parsonii) presented with vesicles that became crusty brown lesions on the limbs and body. Skin biopsies revealed fungal hyphae in the affected epidermis and underlying dermis. The lesions regressed fully after oral administration of itraconazole. An adult jewel chameleon (Chamaeleo lateralis) from the same private collection presented with localized black skin lesions and died while being treated with itraconazole. A pulmonary granuloma was also present in this chameleon at autopsy. Cultures obtained from skin and lung lesions yielded the same fungus. A third isolate was obtained from a skin biopsy of a Jackson's chameleon (Chamaeleo jacksoni) with deep ulcerative cutaneous lesions located at the base of the tail. The fungus, in all three cases, has been identified as the Chrysosporium anamorph of Nannizziopsis vriesii, a poorly known ascomycetous species recorded previously from the skin of a lizard and from soil, on the basis of its keratinolytic activity, resistance to cycloheximide, strongly restricted growth at 37 degrees C, formation of clavate or pyriform single-celled or two-celled aleurioconidia, and alternate and fission arthroconidia.
