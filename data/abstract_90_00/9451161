Gram-negative bacilli (GNB), enterococci, and staphylococci are common members of the human microflora and are often the cause of infectious complications in the elderly, the severely ill, and the immunocompromised patient. In addition, patients with invasive devices (e.g., trachs, feeding tubes, catheters), open wounds, and those whose normal microbial flora have been altered by antimicrobial therapy are also at risk for infection with these microorganisms. Urinary tract infection, bacteremia, and infected wounds are the principal anatomic sites involved.
