We have investigated the antioxidant properties of V79 Chinese hamster cells rendered resistant to menadione by chronic exposure to increasing concentrations of this quinone. MD1, a clone of resistant cells, was compared to the parental M8 cells; the former showed increased activity of catalase (3 fold), glutathione peroxidase (1.6 fold) and DT-diaphorase (2.6 fold), as well as an increase in glutathione (3.2 fold). Although one of the products of menadione metabolism is superoxide anion, no changes in total superoxide dismutase activity was observed in MD1 cells. MD1 menadione resistant cells were also resistant to killing by hydrogen peroxide and contained tandem duplication of chromosome 6. A similar duplication of chromosome 6 was seen in several independently derived menadione resistant clones and therefore seems closed linked to the establishment of the resistance. Upon removal of menadione from the medium, some of these properties of MD1 cells, viz., resistance to menadione, elevated glutathione levels, and glutathione peroxidase activity, were lost and the cells resembled M8 cells. However, resistance to H2O2, elevated catalase activity and the duplicated chromosome remained stable for more than 40 cell passages in the absence of menadione. The increase in catalase activity was correlated with an increase in catalase mRNA content and a 50% amplification of catalase gene, as determined, respectively, by Northern and Southern blot analysis. The role of the chromosome 6 duplication in resistance to oxidative stress remains to be established. It is not responsible directly for elevated catalase levels since the catalase gene is on chromosome 3.
