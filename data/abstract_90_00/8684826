Two genetically defined parents of Eimeria tenella, each characterized by a selectable phenotype, were mated to provide "recombinant' oocysts for an analysis of the inheritance of DNA markers into the sporocyst stage of the life-cycle. A total of 23 populations was established from infection with a putative single sporocyst and their inheritance of DNA markers provided compelling evidence that the 2 sporozoites within each sporocyst are genetically identical. EAch of the 5 polymorphic DNA markers used segregated independently within the "recombinant' parasites and only 1 of the parental forms was inherited in 22 of the populations aimed to have been established from a single sporocyst.
