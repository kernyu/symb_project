The authors summarize data on the efficacy of various prefabricated recombinant interferons against virus, bacterial, and chlamydial infections, and in unfavorable environments. The spaceflight factors were shown to have a negative influence on natural killers in the human body providing the immunological resistance and defence not only from foreign microorganisms but also the body cells transformed because of a virus infection or malignancy. Entalferon awakes a particular interest for its convenience in extreme conditions, space flight included. It is still an open issue whether the interferon sensitivity of natural killers is compromised by space flight. This trend of investigation seems to be of paramount importance and promise in the context of enhancing the antiviral, antimicrobic and antineoplastic immunity of cosmonauts.
