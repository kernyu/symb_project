Twenty-nine field isolates of porcine Pasteurella multocida were characterized for their capsular and somatic types and were evaluated for their susceptibility to 10 antimicrobial agents. Plasmid DNA-screening experiments were conducted to determine whether a relationship existed between the presence of plasmids and antibiotic resistance. Field isolates of P multocida were susceptible to most of the antimicrobials tested, but all isolates were resistant to clindamycin. Eleven isolates of serogroup D were resistant to 1 or 2 antimicrobial agents. Resistance to sulfonamides and streptomycin was observed in 7 isolates. These isolates contained R plasmids conferring resistance to streptomycin and sulfonamides. The R plasmids belonged to 2 groups, one of 5.6 kilobase and the other of 5.9 kilobase. Restriction endonuclease mapping and DNA hybridization revealed that these R plasmids were related to RSF1010 from Salmonella panama, which also confers resistance to streptomycin and sulfonamides.
