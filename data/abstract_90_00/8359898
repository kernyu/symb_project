The effects of in vivo administration of monoclonal antibodies against NK-1.1-bearing cells on the early production of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) in vitro and development of Th1-associated immunity were studied in mice infected with a live vaccine strain of Candida albicans. At 1 and 4 days postinfection, natural killer (NK) cell-enriched fractions from the spleens of antibody-treated mice displayed a dramatic reduction in 5E6+ lymphocytes and negligible anti-YAC-1 cytotoxic activity in vitro. Nevertheless, the frequency of IFN-gamma-producing cells in those fractions was reduced by less than half, on average, by anti-NK-1.1 treatment in vivo. In addition, the antibody-treated and infected mice demonstrated unchanged T helper cell responses, as measured by yeast-specific footpad reactions, resistance to reinfection, occurrence of antibodies of different isotypes, and production in vitro of interleukin-2 (IL-2), IFN-gamma, IL-4, and IL-10 by CD4+ cells. Therefore, although NK cells may contribute to early IFN-gamma production in Candida-vaccinated mice, these cells apparently do not play a dominant role in the qualitative development of yeast-specific T helper responses.
