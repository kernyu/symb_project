Sheep infected with a fenbendazole resistant strain of Haemonchus contortus and goats with a levamisole resistant strain of the same parasite were used to evaluate the anthelmintic efficacy of closantel. Closantel at the rate of 10 mg/kg body weight was 100% effective against the 2 resistant strains of the parasite as indicated by faecal egg count and worm reduction. The efficacy of fenbendazole in sheep and of levamisole in goats was 56.68 and 76.90%, respectively.
