Cystic fibrosis patients suffer from recurrent and chronic lung infections mainly caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The fluoroquinolones, notably ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, represent an important addition to the therapy of P. aeruginosa infections. They offer the possibility of effective oral treatment for early colonisation as well as chronic infections, even in children. They are associated with only few and mild adverse effects. Development of resistance represents an increasing problem.
