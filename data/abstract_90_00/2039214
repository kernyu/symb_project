Meropenem was 8- to 32-fold more active (MIC for 90% of strains = 0.125 micrograms/ml) than imipenem against a collection of Haemophilus influenzae strains characterized as either susceptible to ampicillin or resistant to that agent by virtue of beta-lactamase or nonenzymatic mechanisms. MBCs and kinetic kill curve tests showed that meropenem (as well as imipenem, several cephalosporins, and amoxicillin-clavulanate) was bactericidal against all strains at or within four times the respective MICs. Thus, meropenem demonstrated greater inhibitory activity than imipenem and activity comparable to that of cefotaxime against these selected strains.
