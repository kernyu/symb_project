Cephalosporins are widely used in chemotherapy of bacterial infections and resistance mechanisms seriously impair their antibacterial activity. Several resistant strains of Enterobacter aerogenes, a frequently isolated nosocomial pathogen, were analyzed. One isolate exhibited a strong modification of the porin antigenic pattern, especially with an immunological probe directed against an epitope located inside the pore lumen. A strong decrease of cefepime uptake was evidenced for this isolate, similarly to ones observed for porin-deficient strains: these kinetics show a serious alteration of the channel properties which may support cephalosporin resistance. This is the first E. aerogenes isolate using such adaptive response which defines an original enterobacterial answer to cephalosporin.
