Mitochondria isolated from streptomycin-resistant (S(r)) protoplasts of Phytophthora parasitica were transferred into chloramphenicol-resistant (Cpr) protoplasts of P. parasitica or Phytophthora capsici with an average successful rate of 1.7 x 10(-4), using a selective medium containing streptomycin. No colonies appeared when self-fusion products of donor mitochondria or recipient protoplasts were exposed to the selective medium. Mitochondria isolated from Cpr protoplasts of P. capsici were also transferred into S(r) protoplasts of P. parasitica with a similar success rate using a selective medium containing chloramphenicol. Zoospores produced by the Cpr + S(r) intraspecific mitochondrial hybrid gave rise to S(r) and Cpr + S(r) cultures. The second generation zoospores produced by S(r) and Cpr + S(r) cultures also gave rise to S(r) and Cpr + S(r) cultures, suggesting the possible occurrence of fusion between some of the Cpr mitochondria and S(r) mitochondria, and the displacement of non-fused Cpr mitochondria in the receptor protoplast by the donor S(r) mitochondria. Zoospores produced by the interspecific mitochondrial hybrid gave rise to Cpr, S(r), Cpr + S(r), and Cps + Ss cultures. The second generation zoospores produced by Cpr + S(r) or S(r) cultures also gave rise to the same four types of cultures, suggesting the existence of residual antibiotic-sensitive mitochondria (Cps + Ss) in the parental isolates and the random distribution of Cpr, S(r), and Cps + Ss mitochondria during asexual reproduction. Results suggest that the phenotype of antibiotic resistance/sensitivity was the end result of the interactions among the three types of mitochondria.
