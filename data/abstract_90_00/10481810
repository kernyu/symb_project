Antibacterial activity of various antibiotics against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from each hospitals depends on the variety or amount of antibiotics used in each hospital. The antibiotic, which is effective to P. aeruginosa in a certain hospital is not always effective to that in other hospital. The excellent antibiotics in antibacterial activity have low MIC and hard to progress in resistance, and such antibiotics may be effective against P. aeruginosa isolated from any hospitals. Therefore we thought that the antibiotic, which was progress to resistance, would show a great difference in MIC among hospitals, and we investigated MIC and difference of MIC of various antibiotics against P. aeruginosa isolated from six hospitals. Furthermore, we converted the data of MICs and difference of MIC among six hospitals into the score, and tried to estimate antibacterial activity of various antibiotics by using those scores. From the results of analysis in this report, we think the antibiotics actually surpass in antibacterial activity may be imipenem, cefozopran, cefsulodin and amikacin. New analytical method proposed in this report will become one of potential methods to estimate antibacterial activity of antibiotics against bacteria isolated from inpatient with bacterial infections.
