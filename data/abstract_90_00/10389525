Sputum samples from 100 patients of pulmonary tuberculosis were processed. These patients were admitted in group of Tuberculosis Hospital at Sewri, Mumbai, which is a referral tuberculosis hospital. Isolates were identified as M. Tuberculosis by biochemical tests. Antitubercular sensitivity testing for Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Ethambutol and Streptomycin was performed by resistance ratio method. Total resistance was 36% in our study. Resistance to Isoniazid was 61%: to Rifampicin was 50%, to Ethambutol was 8% and to Streptomycin was 41%. Primary drug resistance to Isoniazid was 45% to Rifampicin was 27%, to Ethambutol was 9%, and to Streptomycin was 54%. Secondary drug resistance to Isoniazid was 68% to Rifampicin was 60%, to Ethambutol was 8% and to Streptomycin was 36%. Secondary drug resistance to Isoniazid and Rifampicin is rising as compared to primary drug resistance to Isoniazid and Rifampicin. This is statistically significant (p < 0.001). 11 out of 36 cases (30%) showed multi drug resistance to Isoniazid and Rifampicin.
