The emergence of rifampin-resistant strains of pathogenic mycobacteria has threatened the usefulness of this drug in treating mycobacterial diseases. Critical to the treatment of individuals infected with resistant strains is the rapid identification of these strains directly from clinical specimens. It has been shown that resistance to rifampin in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae apparently involves mutations in the rpoB gene encoding the beta-subunit of the RNA polymerases of these species. DNA sequences were obtained from a 305-bp fragment of the rpoB gene from 110 rifampin-resistant and 10 rifampin-susceptible strains of M. tuberculosis from diverse geographical regions throughout the world. In 102 of 110 rifampin-resistant strains 16 mutations affecting 13 amino acids were observed. No mutations were observed in rifampin-susceptible strains. No association was found between particular mutations in the rpoB gene and drug susceptibility patterns of multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains. Drug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains from the same outbreak and exhibiting the same IS6110 DNA fingerprint and drug susceptibility pattern contained the same mutation in the rpoB gene. However, mutations are not correlated with IS6110 profiling outside of epidemics. The evolution of rifampin resistance as a consequence of mutations in the rpoB gene was documented in a patient who developed rifampin resistance during the course of treatment. Rifampin-resistant strains of M. leprae, Mycobacterium avium, and Mycobacterium africanum contained mutations in the rpoB gene similar to that documented for M. tuberculosis. This information served as the basis for developing a rapid DNA diagnostic assay (PCR-heteroduplex formation) for the detection of rifampin susceptibility of M. tuberculosis.
