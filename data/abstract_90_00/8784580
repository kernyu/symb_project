Six separate human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients with cryptococcal meningitis were each found to have been infected with a unique strain of Cryptococcus neoformans on the basis of genomic DNA finger-printing analysis with the microsatellite sequence-containing oligonucleotide probe (GGAT)4 and by random amplification of polymorphic DNA. Two patients (A and B) experienced a recurrent episode of infection. Between 12 and 16 single-colony isolates recovered from primary isolation media (> 50% of C. neoformans colonies recovered) from cerebrospinal fluid specimens were fingerprinted from both patients during each episode. The fingerprints of both isolate collections from patient B were very similar, although minor polymorphisms were evident in both sets of profiles. The fingerprints of the isolate collection from the initial episode of infection in patient A were also identical to each other, apart from minor polymorphisms, but they were clearly different from the corresponding profiles of the isolate collection from the recurrent episode, the latter of which were completely identical, apart from minor polymorphisms in a single isolate. Furthermore, prolonged storage and in vitro subculture of the isolates did not alter the fingerprint profiles. These results provided convincing evidence that patients A and B were each infected with a single C. neoformans strain during each episode of infection and that in patient B, the same strain persisted and caused both episodes, while in patient A, a different strain was responsible for each episode. The prevalence of polymorphisms in multiple single-colony isolates from both patients also suggested that C. neoformans populations may undergo microevolution.
