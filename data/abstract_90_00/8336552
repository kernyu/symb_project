The in vitro sensitivity to lysozyme of twelve isolates of Candida (three isolates each of C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata and C. krusei) pre-incubated in sucrose supplemented media, was determined by a growth inhibition assay. In general, C. albicans and C. tropicalis exhibited increased susceptibility to lysozyme as the sucrose concentration in the growth medium was reduced. Candida krusei demonstrated the reverse effect and C. glabrata isolates showed different trends. Although generally the Candida species examined were susceptible to lysozyme in the decreasing order of C. glabrata, C. albicans, C. tropicalis and C. krusei, differences in susceptibility were noted among different isolates within a given species. These results imply that salivary lysozyme and dietary carbohydrates may exert selective pressure on oral colonization by Candida species.
