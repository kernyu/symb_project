The patterns of aminoglycoside inactivating enzymes were determined by AGRP in 31 clinical isolated of Serratia marcescens. The results were compared with the data on identification of the aminoglycoside resistance genes by the specific DNA probes. It was shown that all the isolates of Serratia marcescens contained the AAC(6')-Ic gene which was not expressed in some isolates. The other detected aminoglycoside inactivating enzymes were the following: AAC(3)-V in 17 isolates, ANT(2'') in 7 isolates, AAC(3)-I in 4 isolates and APH(3')-I in 13 isolates. Reliability of the methods of AGRP and DNA-DNA hybridization was estimated in the assay of the aminoglycoside resistant clinical strains of Serratia marcescens.
