BACKGROUND: The emergence and spread of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) has presented serious therapeutic difficulties because of the lack of reliably active antibiotics. Quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new injectable streptogramin antibiotic that is active against most strains of VREF. Experience with this agent in adults with VREF infections is well-documented; however, there are few reports of its use in children. We report on eight children with VREF infections who received quinupristin/dalfopristin under a compassionate use protocol. METHODS: Quinupristin/dalfopristin was administered according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Clinical and laboratory data were recorded for each patient. RESULTS: The infections treated comprised six cases of bacteremia and two of peritonitis. All patients had serious underlying conditions. Seven patients recovered fully. One patient died, having experienced a relapse of his infection after quinupristin/dalfopristin was discontinued. None of the patients experienced side effects or other adverse events. CONCLUSION: Quinupristin/dalfopristin was well-tolerated and generally effective in children with infections caused by VREF. There is increasing evidence that it may be more effective than other currently available antibiotics in some such patients.
