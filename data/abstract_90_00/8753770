A novel membrane-soluble prodrug of the 5'-monophosphate derivative of 3TC containing a phenyl group and the methyl ester of L-alanine linked to the phosphorus through a phosphoramidate bond with the primary amino moiety (designated Cf 1109) was prepared. The 3TC prodrug proved less potent an inhibitor of HIV-1 and HIV-2 replication in CEM cell cultures than 3TC, but lost only 20-fold antiviral potency in 2'-deoxycytidine kinase-deficient CEM/dCK- cells compared with a more than 2,000-fold decrease of activity of 3TC. In contrast, 3TC and Cf 1109 proved equally highly effective in inhibiting HBV release in supernatants of HBV-transfected Hep G2 2.2.15 cell cultures (50% effective concentration approximately 0.02 microM). Both compounds easily selected for highly resistant HIV-1 strains at a comparable speed of breakthrough. The mutant viruses contained an 184-Ile and/or 184-Val amino acid change in their reverse transcriptase. Our data are suggestive for a relatively poor delivery of 3TC-MP in the intact CEM cells but a remarkably high delivery of 3TC and/or 3TC-MP in the intact Hep G2 2.2.15 cells.
