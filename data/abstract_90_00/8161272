Efficacy of the combined therapy of experimental salmonellosis was studied on albino rats with using ampicillin, gentamicin, tetracycline and immunomodulators such as levamisole and quadevite. The influence of the combined chemoimmunotherapy on the indices of the nonspecific resistance of the animals i.e. the titers of lysozyme and beta-lysines, the complement activity and the blood serum bactericidal index was investigated. An increase in the survival of the animals exposed to the combinations of tetracycline with levamisole and quadevite by comparison with the animal survival after the monotherapy was revealed. The combinations of gentamicin with quadevite and tetracycline with the immunomodulators significantly increased the blood serum bactericidal index.
