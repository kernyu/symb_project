Three imipenem-resistant mutants were obtained from a clinical isolate (C152) of Shigella dysenteriae by selection with increasing concentrations of imipenem. Resistance to imipenem was associated with resistance to several other beta-lactam antibiotics. The penicillin-binding protein (PBP) patterns of the resistant and the wild-type strains were comparable. The permeability of the outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of the most resistant mutant, IM16, was lower than that of the parent strain C152 when imipenem and arabinose were used as test solutes. This mutant had lower levels of both the major OMPs of M(r) 43,000 and 38,000. There were also differences in the patterns of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of the mutants and the wild-type strain. The mutant IM16 had less short-chain LPS than the parent C152. Increasing imipenem resistance was also associated with a concomitant decrease in the level of 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate, a component of the core region of LPS.
