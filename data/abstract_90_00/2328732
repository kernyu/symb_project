The clonal cell line HT29-D4 is able to differentiate by two different ways: i) by replacing glucose by galactose in the culture medium; ii) by addition of suramin (a drug known to interfere with the growth promoting activity of growth factors) in the medium. In both cases the transition in the organization of the cell monolayer occurred without cell loss. The two ways (i.e., glucose starvation or suramin addition) lead to polarized cells which generate electrically active cell monolayers (Fantini et al., Biol. Cell 65, 163-169 (1989) and this paper). Yet several important differences can be observed at the morphological or at the electrophysiological levels. 1) The suramin-treated cells (HT29-D4-S cells) organized into monolayers of high (40-50 microns) columnar cells while glucose-starved cells (HT29-D4-Gal cells) were rather cuboidal (20-25 microns). 2) HT29-D4-S cells were highly polarized; the nucleus was rejected at the basal side of the cell and lysosomes in the upper part of the cytoplasm. Numerous lipid-like droplets surrounded with glycogen were observed underneath the nucleus. HT29-D4-Gal cells never presented such a degree of organization. 3) The transepithelial resistance and the potential difference of HT29-D4-S monolayers reached values significantly higher than those for HT29-D4-Gal monolayers, reflecting a higher degree of organization. Specific proteins such as sucrase-isomaltase, alkaline phosphatase and carcinoembryonic antigen were localized exclusively on the apical membrane while human lymphocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules were restricted to the basolateral membrane for both HT29-D4-S and HT29-D4-Gal cells. The present data demonstrate that the same cells can generate a different degree of cellular organization according to the experimental conditions of cell growth, the most elaborate state of differentiation being obtained in the presence of suramin.
