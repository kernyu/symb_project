Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefditoren pivoxil (CDTR-PI, ME 1207) were performed in children. The results were as follows: 1. A total of 18 patients (19 infections) were treated with CDTR-PI. The doses ranged 2.1-3.2 mg/kg, and it was orally administered 3 times daily, for 4-10 days. Clinical efficacies of CDTR-PI in 18 patients with 19 bacterial infections (3 with tonsillitis, 1 with bronchitis, 7 with pneumonia, 1 with acute maxillary sinusitis, 4 with otitis media, 1 with urinary tract infection, 2 with skin and soft tissue infection) were evaluated as excellent in 13 infections and as good in 6 infections with an efficacy rate of 100%. Twelve causative strains of 5 species were found in 11 patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae in 2 cases out of 3, Haemophilus influenzae in 4/4, Staphylococcus aureus in 2/2, Haemophilus parainfluenzae in 2/2 and Escherichia coli in 1/1 were eradicated. Two patients had mild diarrhea but did not need specific treatment. Severe adverse reaction was not observed in any of the 18 patients. 2. MICs of CDTR were examined against 4 clinically isolated S. pneumoniae strains. Two strains of S. pneumoniae were relatively resistant to penicillins. 3. Pharmacokinetic studies Peak serum CDTR concentrations in 3 patients were 2.38 micrograms/ml, 0.72 micrograms/ml and 2.25 micrograms/ml at a dose of CDTR-PI 3 mg/kg orally administered at 30-minute after meal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
