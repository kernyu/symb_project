Ciprofloxacin is now widely used as the drug of choice for those severe salmonella infections where antibiotic therapy is indicated. Between 1991 and 1994 ciprofloxacin resistance in salmonellas isolated from humans in England and Wales increased from 0.3% to 2.1%. Among the most prevalent serotypes the highest incidence was seen in Salmonella hadar where ciprofloxacin resistance has increased from 2.0% in 1991 to 39.6% in 1994. The incidence of ciprofloxacin resistance remains uncommon in other serotypes and in 1994 5.1% of Salmonella virchow and Salmonella newport were resistant compared with 1.4% of Salmonella typhimurium and 0.4% of Salmonella enteritidis. There has been a number of examples of development of resistance to quinolone drugs during treatment of human infections. Ciprofloxacin resistance also occurs in salmonellas isolated from food animals and human food. This increasing incidence of ciprofloxacin resistance reflects the more widespread use of fluoroquinolone drugs in both humans and food animals.
