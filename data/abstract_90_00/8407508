We compared efficacy of cefadroxil and generic and proprietary cephalexin in treatment of pyoderma in dogs. Forty-four dogs were randomly assigned to receive 1 of the 3 preparations at 22 to 35 mg/kg body weight, every 12 hours. Dogs were examined at the conclusion of treatment period and assessed as to degree of improvement. All 3 cephalosporins were effective and safe antibiotics for the treatment of pyoderma in dogs.
