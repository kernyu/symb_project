In this work the resistance of 172 motile Aeromonas isolates recovered from raw drinking water supplies (56), irrigation waters (60) and runoff waters receiving sewage (56), to some antibiotics and heavy metals was investigated by agar diffusion and agar dilution methods. A high proportion of isolates from all water sources showed resistance to carbenicillin, erythromycin, streptomycin, cephradine and cadmium, and susceptibility to chloramphenicol, kanamycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, nalidixic acid, trimethoprim-sulphametoxazole and chromium. No amikacin-resistant Aeromonas were recovered. No relationship was found between antimicrobial resistance and Aeromonas species, with the exception of cephradine, that exhibited a significantly higher activity against the A. sobria isolates than the other Aeromonas species (P < 0.05). Moderately polluted waters showed lower antibiotic multiresistance and metal susceptibility than unpolluted and highly polluted ones. Although significant differences (P < 0.05), between resistance frequencies to erythromycin, carbenicillin, streptomycin and cephradine were found among isolates from different sources, the antimicrobial resistance patterns of aeromonads could not be related to the level of faecal pollution. These results indicate that aeromonads resistant to antibiotics and heavy metals are easily recovered from water sources in Chile, posing a potential public health risk.
