We examined the efficacy of ampicillin-sulbactam (2:1) and cefoxitin in the treatment of infections caused by Escherichia coli strains exhibiting increasing levels of beta-lactamase-mediated resistance to ampicillin-sulbactam in the rat intra-abdominal abscess model. Cefoxitin was superior to ampicillin-sulbactam in the treatment of infections caused by all strains. Treatment with ampicillin-sulbactam resulted in a statistically significant decrease in CFU per gram of abscess in comparison with treatment with ampicillin alone for both the moderately resistant and the resistant strains, with an inverse correlation between the MIC and the absolute decrease in CFU per gram of abscess.
