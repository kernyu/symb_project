Brefeldin A (BFA) is used to probe trafficking of proteins through the central vacuolar system (CVS) in a variety of cells. Transepithelial Na+ transport by high-resistance epithelia, such as A6 cultured cells, is inhibited by BFA. Apical Na+ channels, as well as basolateral pumps and K+ channels, are complex proteins that probably traverse the CVS for routing to the plasma membrane. BFA (5 micrograms/ml) decreases transepithelial Na+ current near zero and increases resistance reversibly after 4 h. Longer exposures are toxic. When tissues were treated for 20 h with 0.2 microgram/ml BFA, Na+ transport also was reversibly inhibited. Using noise analysis, we found that BFA drastically reduced apical Na+ channel density. The increase in single channel current was consistent with cell hyperpolarization. After apical permeabilization with nystatin, changes in transepithelial current reflect changes in basolateral membrane transport. Transport at this membrane was inhibited by ouabain and cycloheximide, but not by BFA. After BFA, aldosterone was ineffective, suggesting that an intact CVS is required for stimulation by this hormone. Thus BFA inhibition of Na+ transport is localized at the apical membrane. Implications for channel turnover as a mechanism for regulating the Na+ transport rate are discussed.
