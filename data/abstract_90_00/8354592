Seventeen adult patients with chronic osteomyelitis were treated with oral ciprofloxacin, 750 mg twice daily. Treatment ranged from 28 to 254 days. Efficacy was considered to be good, based upon clinical resolution observed in 13 patients (76%). Clinical and microbiological failure was observed in 3 patients (18%), and there was one case of reinfection. Tolerance was very satisfactory, since the adverse reactions were mild and transitory; these occurred in 7 patients (41%), being cutaneous rash in 4 patients and diarrhoea in 3 patients. No patient had to discontinue treatment. Thus, oral ciprofloxacin may be useful option for the prolonged treatment of chronic osteomyelitis, provided that it is always associated with surgical debridement. Due to the probable development of ciprofloxacin resistance in the S. aureus multiresistant strain, already observed in two patients in the present investigation, it is suggested that for the treatment of such infections another drug with antistaphylococcal activity should be associated with the ciprofloxacin.
