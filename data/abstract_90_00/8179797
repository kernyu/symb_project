Bacterial and fungal infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality after orthotopic liver transplantation. In the immunocompromised host, infections are thought to arise from the gut, which is almost always colonized with potential pathogens. Using oral selective bowel decontamination (SBD), potential pathogens can be eradicated from the gut and infections prevented. In this catamnestic study we have reviewed gastrointestinal colonization, bacterial and fungal infections, and bacterial resistance to standard antibiotics in our first 206 liver transplant patients while under SBD. With few exceptions, gram-negatives were eradicated from the gastrointestinal tract and secondary colonization was inhibited. In spite of unsatisfactory elimination of Candida, probably because nystatin doses were too low, Candida infections were rare (n = 4) and none was fatal. One and two-year survival rates were 93% and 92%, respectively. The bacterial and fungal infection rate was 27.8% with an infection-related mortality of 1.95%. Infections with aerobic gram-positive bacteria prevailed and only 11 gram-negative and 11 fungal infections occurred; among the latter, Aspergillus and Mucor were the most serious and responsible for three of the six deaths in this series. With regard to the development of resistance, we found an increasing number of enterococci and coagulase-negative staphylococci resistant to ciprofloxacin and imipenem, respectively, but unlikely as a consequence of SBD.
