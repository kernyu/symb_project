The etiology of rotavirus in acute diarrhoeal illness in children 0-5 years of age, admitted to the Pediatric wards of Kasturba Medical College Hospital, Manipal was studied, over a period of one year. Rotavirus in the faecal samples detected by the slide latex agglutination test accounted for 14.9% of the diarrheas with maximum incidence in the 7-12 months of age group (57.5%). Bacterial enteropathogens continued to play a significant role in diarrheal diseases. Salmonella enteritis was found more in the age group 0-6 months and shigellosis in 37-60 months. In a control study of 100 children who had no diarrhea, 2 were found positive for rotaviruses.
