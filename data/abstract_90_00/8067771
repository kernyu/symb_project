Children with meningitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates that are relatively or fully resistant to penicillin and have decreased susceptibility to broad-spectrum cephalosporins (MIC, > or = 2.0 micrograms/ml) who have failed treatment with broad-spectrum cephalosporins have been reported. The National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards has newly revised guidelines indicating that S. pneumoniae isolates associated with meningitis for which the MICs are > or = 0.5 micrograms/ml should be considered resistant to broad-spectrum cephalosporins. This recommendation is not clearly based on data related to clinical outcome and may be too conservative. We present data on five children who had S. pneumoniae meningitis due to isolates that were relatively or fully resistant to penicillin (MIC range, 0.125 to 4.0 micrograms/ml) and had cefotaxime or ceftriaxone MICs of 0.50 to 2.0 micrograms/ml. Their clinical courses and outcomes were comparable to those of five children with S. pneumoniae meningitis due to strains that were relatively or fully resistant to penicillin and were inhibited by cefotaxime at concentrations of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml, as well as to those of 25 patients with S. pneumoniae meningitis due to penicillin-susceptible isolates identified during the same period. Children with meningitis due to S. pneumoniae with cefotaxime or ceftriaxone MICs of < or = 1.0 micrograms/ml may be adequately treated with these antibiotics. Further clinical data are required before solid recommendations can be made regarding cephalosporin breakpoints for S. pneumoniae.
