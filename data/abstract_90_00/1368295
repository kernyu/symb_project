A host-vector system was established in Lactobacillus helveticus with beta-galactosidase activity as a selection marker. Plasmid pBG10 was constructed by joining the beta-galactosidase gene from L. bulgaricus, the promoter region of the erythromycin resistance gene from pAM beta 1, the replication region of pBR329, and the replication region of the L. helveticus cryptic plasmid pLJ1. L. helveticus SBT2195 (Lac- mutant), transformed with pBG10, was selected on skim milk plates. The structural gene of alpha-amylase (1536 bp) from Bacillus licheniformis, inserted downstream of the promoter region of the erythromycin resistance gene of pBG10, was expressed in L. helveticus SBT2195. Plasmid pBG10 is a food-grade and expression vector in L. helveticus.
