The susceptibilities of 43 pharyngeal isolates of Capnocytophaga to beta-lactam antibiotics, alone or in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors, were tested by an agar dilution method. The 34 beta-lactamase-positive strains were highly resistant to beta-lactams, but the intrinsic activities of clavulanate, tazobactam, and sulbactam against Capnocytophaga, even beta-lactamase producers, indicates that these beta-lactamase inhibitors could be used for empirical treatment of neutropenic patients with oral sources of infection.
