Experimental investigations on the spectrum and degree of the expression of trental antiviral activity were carried out. The investigations were done in cell cultures and laboratory animals using laboratory strains (including drug-resistant ones) of 13 viruses, causative agents of human and animal infections. The drug demonstrated its activity against 8 viruses of 7 families. It was highly active against 5 viruses: herpes simplex virus (including its acyclovir-resistant strain), vaccinia virus (including its methisazone-resistant strain), rotavirus and tick-borne encephalitis virus. As regards other viruses, its activity was less pronounced (hepatitis JA virus) or low (vesicular stomatitis virus, West Nile virus). It was concluded that, being a cardiovascular drug, trental was an effective broad spectrum virus inhibitor.
