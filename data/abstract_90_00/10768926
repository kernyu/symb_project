Our previous study showed that gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), a T-helper 1 (Th1)-type cytokine, plays a detrimental role in Staphylococcus aureus infection in mice. In this study, the role of Th2-type cytokines such as interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-10 in S. aureus infection was investigated. IL-10 mRNA was induced in parallel with IFN-gamma in the spleens and kidneys of mice during S. aureus infection, whereas IL-4 mRNA was induced in the spleens but not in the kidneys of these animals. Spleen cells obtained from S. aureus-infected mice produced lower titers of IFN-gamma and higher titers of IL-4 and IL-10 in response to heat-killed S. aureus than did those from uninfected mice. Administration of anti-IL-4 monoclonal antibody (MAb) or anti-IL-10 MAb inhibited the elimination of S. aureus cells from the kidneys of mice. IFN-gamma mRNA expression was enhanced in the spleens of anti-IL-4 MAb- or anti-IL-10 MAb-treated mice and also in the kidneys of anti-IL-4 MAb-treated animals. Next, we evaluated the role of IFN-gamma in S. aureus infection in IFN-gamma(-/-) mice. An increase in survival rates, a decrease in bacterial numbers in the kidneys, and an amelioration of histologic abnormalities in these organs were observed in IFN-gamma(-/-) mice compared with those in IFN-gamma(+/+) mice. Administration of MAb against IL-4 or IL-10 failed to affect bacterial growth in the spleens and kidneys of IFN-gamma(-/-) mice irrespective of the expression of Th2 response. These results suggest that S. aureus infection induced a Th2 response and that IL-4 and IL-10 might play a protective role through the regulation of IFN-gamma in S. aureus infection.
