Effects of three different types of short-term applications (1-3 times during 1 week) of chlorhexidine (1 or 40%) on the susceptibility of 863 clinical isolates of Streptococcus mutans and 53 isolates of Streptococcus sobrinus from 58 subjects were studied. Chlorhexidine-resistant isolates were not found either before or after the treatment. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to chlorhexidine of all isolates of S. mutans were < or = 1 microgram/ml, and of S. sobrinus < or = 2 micrograms/ml. S. mutans and S. sobrinus were also susceptible to ampicillin, penicillin, cefuroxime, and tetracycline. In conclusion, different short-term chlorhexidine regimens do not induce resistance in S. mutans or S. sobrinus and, furthermore, these species have so far retained their susceptibility to common antibiotics.
