The formation of thiostreptone resistant spontaneous and nitrosoguanidine-induced mutants in the erythromycin-producing organism Saccharopolyspora erythraea was investigated. The investigated collection of the mutants was heterogeneous by the level of the thiostreptone resistance (2.5 to 20 micrograms/ml). The thiostreptone resistance mutations had a pleiotropic effect: 17 per cent of the mutants was characterized by the growth thermosensitivity and 26 and 5.8 per cent of the mutants were characterized by loss of the ability to form melanine and aerial mycelium respectively. Such phenotypes were most frequent in the mutants resistant to low concentrations of thiostreptone (2 to 5 micrograms/ml). The absolute majority of the isolated thiostreptone resistant mutants was unstable and formed both the antibiotic resistant and the antibiotic sensitive clones. The greatest portion of the strains with high antibiotic activity (20 per cent) was detected among the S. erythraea spontaneous mutants on the medium with 2.5 micrograms/ ml of thiostreptone. It was shown that the instability of the high antibiotic activity in the mutants was associated with loss of the thiostreptone resistance property.
