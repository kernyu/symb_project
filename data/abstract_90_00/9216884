Treatment of nonmucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa with gyrase inhibitors such as ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin, which target the A subunit of topoisomerase II, resulted in 100% conversion to the mucoid phenotype. However, antibiotics that partially inhibited growth and macromolecular synthesis (DNA, RNA, protein, or peptidoglycan) of nonmucoid isolates in a gluconate-limited chemostat culture system did not promote conversion to mucoid subpopulations. An increase in resistance was observed in populations that expressed the mucoid phenotype. Both mucoid conversion and antibiotic resistance were completely reversible when ciprofloxacin pressure was withdrawn, but only partially reversible by the removal of norfloxacin and ofloxacin. Thus, these experiments indicate that in the presence of some fluoroquinolones, a conditional response resulting in mucoid conversion and antibiotic resistance may occur.
