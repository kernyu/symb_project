Two Trypanosoma simiae stocks were initiated in culture with tsetse-derived metacyclics. They were propagated axenically as trypomastigote forms at 35 degrees C in 4% CO2 in air. Populations of trypanosomes were incubated with various concentrations of antitrypanosomal compounds. Growth was monitored after 24 h of incubation and the growth inhibition was calculated. Diminazene aceturate, quinapyramine sulphate, DL-alpha-difluoromethylornithine, and Ro 15-0216 showed activity against the stocks. Suramin and Mel Cy showed little effect upon the growth of the parasite populations. Isometamidium chloride gave questionable results in the 24 h growth inhibition test, but the results of a long-term viability assay indicated some degree of drug resistance (or drug tolerance). The results obtained herein correlate with observations obtained from in vivo studies in pigs. It is thus concluded that in many cases the cryptic nature of T. simiae rather than drug resistance is responsible for the failure of chemotherapy of simiae-trypanosomiasis in pigs.
