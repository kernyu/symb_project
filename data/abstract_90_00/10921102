OBJECTIVE: To explore the methods of combined chemosensitivity test in vitro. METHODS: The chemosensitivity of leukemia cells to 7 kinds of combined chemotherapy regimens, including DA, HA, AA, MA, HAD, HAA and HAM, was estimated in 79 patients with ANLL by MTT assay in vitro. The ratios of drug combinations at which synergistic interactions between drugs are to the highest levels were determined by using Chou's "median effect analysis". RESULTS: There were 67 S(sensitive)/S, 9 R(resistant)/R, 2 R/S, 1 S/R(in vitro/in vivo) in 79 patients. The general, positive and negative coincident rates of in vitro with in vivo, specificity and sensitivity were 96.2%, 98.5%, 81.8%, 88.9% and 97.1%, respectively. CONCLUSION: This method is better than the single drug test, and it is more useful to find drug resistant patients.
