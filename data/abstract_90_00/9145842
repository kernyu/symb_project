Bacterial adhesion, which plays an important role in Staphylococcus aureus colonization and infection, may be altered by the presence of antibiotics or/and antibiotic resistance determinants. This study evaluated the effect of fluoroquinolone resistance determinants on S. aureus adhesion to solid-phase fibronectin, which is specifically mediated by two surface-located fibronectin-binding proteins. Five isogenic mutants, derived from strain NCTC 8325 and expressing various levels of quinolone resistance, were tested in an in vitro bacterial adhesion assay with polymethylmethacrylate coverslips coated with increasing amounts of fibronectin. These strains contained single or combined mutations in the three major loci contributing to fluoroquinolone resistance, namely, grlA, gyrA, and flqB, which code for altered topoisomerase IV, DNA gyrase, and increased norA-mediated efflux of fluoroquinolones, respectively. Adhesion characteristics of the different quinolone-resistant mutants grown in the absence of fluoroquinolone showed only minor differences from those of parental strains. However, more important changes in adhesion were exhibited by mutants highly resistant to quinolones following their exponential growth in the presence of one-quarter MIC of ciprofloxacin. Increased bacterial adhesion of the highly quinolone-resistant mutants, which contained combined mutations in grlA and gyrA, was associated with and explained by the overexpression of their fibronectin-binding proteins as assessed by Western ligand affinity blotting. These findings contradict the notion that subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics generally decrease the expression of virulence factors by S. aureus. Perhaps the increased adhesion of S. aureus strains highly resistant to fluoroquinolones contributes in part to that emergence in clinical settings.
