N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant precursor of intracellular glutathione (GSH), usually given in human as a mucolytic agent. In vitro, NAC and GSH have been shown to act on T cells by increasing interleukin (IL) 2 production, synthesis and turnover of IL-2 receptors, proliferation, cytotoxic properties, and resistance to apoptosis. We report here that NAC and GSH decrease in a dose-dependent manner human IL-4 production by stimulated peripheral blood T cells and by T helper (Th) 0- and Th2-like T cell clones. This effect was associated with a decrease in IL-4 messenger RNA transcription. In contrast, NAC and GSH had no effect on interferon gamma and increased IL-2 production and T cell proliferation. A functional consequence was the capacity of NAC and GSH to selectively decrease in a dose-dependent manner IL-4-induced immunoglobulin (Ig) E and IgG4 production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Interestingly, NAC and GSH also acted directly on purified tonsillar B cells by decreasing the mature epsilon messenger RNA, hence decreasing IgE production. In contrast, IgA and IgM production were not affected. At the same time, B cell proliferation was increased in a dose-dependent manner. Not all antioxidants tested but only SH-bearing molecules mimicked these properties. Finally, when given orally to mice, NAC decreased both IgE and IgG1 antibody responses to ovalbumin. These results demonstrate that NAC, GSH, and other thiols may control the production of both the Th2-derived cytokine IL-4 and IL-4-induced Ig in vitro and in vivo.
