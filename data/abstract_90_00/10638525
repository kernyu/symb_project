Five independent populations (lines) of Drosophila melanogaster were selected for female starvation resistance. Females and males from the selected lines were relatively starvation resistant when compared to flies from five control lines. Moreover, flies from selected lines were resistant to other stresses: desiccation, acetone fumes, ethanol fumes, and paraquat (a source of oxygen radicals). Data from a variety of previous studies indicate an association between stress resistance and longevity. In this context, the present study addressed the question of whether flies from the stress-resistant lines were relatively long-lived. Replicate population cages from each selected and control line were used to assess longevity. Neither females nor males from the selected lines were relatively long-lived. In at least some cases, stress resistance may be necessary, but not sufficient, for longevity.
