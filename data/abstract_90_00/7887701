Broad-spectrum versus narrow-spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis for patients who undergo cardiac operations is variously advocated to reduce the incidence of all infections or, conversely, to prevent resistant superinfections. Previous studies of prophylaxis have shown a reduction in the incidence of staphylococcal infections with some increased resistance. We studied preoperative and postoperative wound colonization as a surrogate for infection. Among 78 patients undergoing cardiac procedures, the type of prophylaxis was allocated as follows: narrow-spectrum (nafcillin), 24 patients; midspectrum (cephapirin), 26 patients; and broad-spectrum (ceftriaxone), 28 patients. Seventeen patients who underwent other procedures received no antibiotics and served as controls. Cultures of the operative site were done preoperatively, and 3 and 6 days postoperatively. The incidence of preoperative skin colonization with staphylococci was identical (95%) in all groups. Postoperatively, more patients receiving nafcillin (48%) were culture-negative for all organisms than were either of the other groups receiving antibiotics (27% and 22%) (p < 0.05). Gram-negative bacilli were infrequent colonizers and neither did the incidence of infection with these organisms increase nor did resistance develop in any group. The infection rates were not different among the treatment groups. Thus, a narrow-spectrum antistaphylococcal penicillin may offer an advantage in terms of both prophylaxis for cardiac operations and hospital costs.
