Helicobacter pylori is the most common infection in the world and is associated with some of the most prevalent gastroduodenal diseases. There is now considerable evidence that Helicobacter pylori eradication not only heals duodenal ulcer, but also prevents ulcer recurrences and probably ulcer complication. It is, therefore, universally accepted that, all patients with duodenal ulcer disease should receive eradication therapy. This review represents an attempt to summarize and analyse all the regimens proposed in September at the last International Meetings in Budapest and Wien in which different anti Helicobacter pylori regimens have been used. Despite the large number of clinical trials which had been performed, no significant advances have been made in relation to Helicobacter pylori therapy, so the "optimal" eradication treatment still remains a matter of debate. More than 10,000 patients were treated and most of them (around 5000) were found to have peptic ulcer disease which represents no more than 10-15% of our endoscopic findings. The proton pump inhibitor regimens are definitely the most representative drug policy appearing in the literature and despite several attempts (proton pump inhibitor given for less, one, or more than one week) the short one-week regimen (The Maastricht regimen) has been recognized as the most promising treatment.
