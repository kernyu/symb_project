The focus of this article is to review the development of antimicrobial resistance among several sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and to discuss the frequency and mechanisms of resistance and recommendations for treatment of selected STDs in which resistance to certain antimicrobial agents has increased. For a number of STDs, such as Chlamydia trachomatis and syphilis, no evidence of antimicrobial resistance has developed over the years, although management of these diseases, such as in the case of pelvic inflammatory disease or syphilis in HIV-infected individuals, requires intensive treatment and follow-up to ensure effectiveness of treatment.
