To study the association of multidrug-resistant enteroaggregative Escherichia coli with persistent diarrhea in Kenyan children, stool specimens were obtained from 862 outpatients under 5 years of age from July 1991 to June 1993. E. coli O44 was identified as the sole bacterial pathogen in four patients experiencing at least 14 days of fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. Disk diffusion testing showed E. coli O44 resistance to tetracycline, ampicillin, erythromycin, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, and amoxicillin/clavulanate and sensitivity to chloramphenicol, nalidixic acid, azithromycin, and cefuroxime. Further studies are needed to clarify the epidemiology, clinical spectrum, and pathogenesis of enteroaggregative E. coli infection.
