Gelatinous dressings were exposed to gamma-radiation or treated with formaldehyde to improve their resistance to the proteolytic effects of trypsin. After aging of the preparations, both gamma-irradiated and blank samples of gelatinous dressings were etched at a constant rate. Etching rate of the formaldehyde treated dressings decreases during storage.
