Perhaps the most important recent advance in the field of infections due to the Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) is the identification and development of more effective agents for the treatment and prevention of disseminated disease. These agents include clarithromycin, azithromycin, rifabutin and other rifamycins, ethambutol, clofazimine, fluoroquinolones, amikacin, and liposome-encapsulated gentamicin. Most clinicians currently use multidrug therapy to maximize efficacy and to minimize the emergence of resistance. Prospective clinical trials of multidrug regimens suggest that MAC colony counts in blood decline during therapy, usually with alleviation of clinical symptoms. The small size and short duration of these trials have not permitted an evaluation of survival or quality of life. Because the contribution of any single agent to multidrug trials is difficult to assess, short-term trials of monotherapy have been conducted recently; clarithromycin, azithromycin, ethambutol, and liposome-encapsulated gentamicin have been most active. Rifabutin and rifampin, clofazimine, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin may contribute to the efficacy of multidrug regimens. Current recommendations include the following: (1) disseminated MAC disease should be treated in patients with AIDS; (2) initial treatment should consist of at least two agents; (3) oral clarithromycin or azithromycin is the preferred first agent; (4) ethambutol is the most rational choice for the second agent; and (5) in appropriate cases, additional agents (rifampin or rifabutin, clofazimine, ciprofloxacin, or parenteral amikacin) may be added. Therapy should continue for life.
