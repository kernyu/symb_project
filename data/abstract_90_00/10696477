For the first time, microcin-producing strains showing inhibitory activities against enteropathogen Salmonella enteritidis were isolated from poultry intestinal contents. Among the numerous strains isolated, two strains of Escherichia coli, named J02 and J03, showing the greatest activities against S. enteritidis, were studied. Biochemical tests and purification identified the main antagonist compound produced as microcin J25. In order to evaluate the protective potential of E. coli J02 and J03 against S. enteritidis infection, the ability of these strains to inhibit growth of S. enteritidis was investigated in mixed culture. A strong antagonist activity was obtained with a preculture phase of the active strain in minimal medium before incubation with S. enteritidis. In a bioreactor experiment simulating the chicken gastric and intestinal tract environment, a mixture of the two strains E. coli J02 and J03, provided an enhanced inhibitory effect. Microcinogenic strain activities were not affected by bile, pancreatic enzymes addition, or acidic conditions. These results suggest the relevant role of microcin-producing microorganisms in microbial intestinal ecology. To conclude, this study shows that microcin J25 strains could exert a beneficial protective effect against S. enteritidis growth in situ.
