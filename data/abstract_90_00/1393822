Conidia and mycelial cells of Fonsecaea pedrosoi ATCC 46428 were obtained for analyses of lipid composition. Total lipids, phospholipids, sterols, and qualitative sterols and fatty acid composition were determined. A higher lipid content was detected in conidia than in mycelial cells of Fonsecaea pedrosoi, which could not be attributed to total sterols and phospholipids. In both forms of this fungus, ergosterol was the only sterol detected. The minimal inhibitory concentration of amphotericin B was lower for conidia than for mycelium.
