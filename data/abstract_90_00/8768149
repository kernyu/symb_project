It is important to know the diagnostic procedure and therapy of polymyositis (PM) inspite of its rare incidence. We describe a case with PM, interstitial lung disease, high titers of anti-Jo-1-antibodies and affection of the right hand, that could be followed over 11 years. The differentiation of PM from neurologic diseases and toxic myopathies is mentioned. The patient was successfully treated with cyclosporin over a period of 20 months, but he is now in remission while receiving steroids alone. We emphasize the importance of early treatment of PM with high-dose steroids and the addition of immunosuppressive drugs (azathioprin, methotrexate, cyclophosphamid) in cases with high disease activity or resistance to steroids. In the treatment of PM/DM immunoglobulins play an increasingly important role. The problems of long-term treatment with steroids are of special interest.
