The development of medicine has been accompanied by the increase of the proportion of immunocompromised patients and as a consequence of antibiotic use, bacterial resistance has reached an unexpected level. Along with these changes, we have been witnessing the rapid development of antimicrobial therapy that comprises several components besides the development of new molecules. The learning of pharmacodynamic effects of particular antibiotic classes can improve the efficacy of therapy and a better cure rate can be achieved in empiric therapy by the knowledge of risk factors and local resistance patterns. It has become clear that an antibiotic policy based exclusively on restriction would result in increased bacterial resistance rate after a temporary decrease of antibiotic cost and was unable to prevent the emerge and spread of multiresistant strains. The solution is the rational and adequate use of antimicrobials, based on the modern theory and practice of antibiotic policy and infection control, that cannot be carried out without the activities of experts in this field.
