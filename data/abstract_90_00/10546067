This report describes a method for the assessment of inhibitor binding affinities to wild type HIV-1 aspartic protease and to its drug-resistant mutant forms. We have elaborated a refined method for molecular modeling of the 3D structures of mutant enzymes and enzyme-inhibitor complexes based on the crystal structure of the wild type form, which employs a full thermodynamic cycle. Model complexes of four HIV-1 aspartic protease mutants with ten analogs of the A77003 inhibitor were considered. Predictions of inhibition efficiency, resistance potential, and hydrophilicity of the redesigned A77003 analogs were obtained by employing molecular mechanics for the evaluation of enzyme-inhibitor complexation energy and the polarizable continuum model for the estimation of solvent effects. Simple qualitative indicators for structural modifications aimed at overcoming the emergence of HIV resistance to protease inhibitors and at increasing the bioavailability of pseudopeptide inhibitors are examined. A semi-quantitative method for the description of enzyme-ligand binding and its implications for the rational design of inhibitors with higher binding affinity towards emerging HIV PR mutants is presented.
