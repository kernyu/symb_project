BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The worldwide increase in antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae prompted the authors to evaluate the status and course of resistance in gonococci in Finland. GOALS: The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of penicillin, tetracycline, spectinomycin, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and cefixime were tested for 337 consecutive clinical N. gonorrhoeae isolates collected in 19 Finnish microbiology laboratories in 1993. STUDY DESIGN: The results were compared with data obtained in three Finnish laboratories in 1986 and contrasted with the development of the incidence of gonorrhea and the prevalence of penicillinase-producing N. gonorrhoeae (PPNG) in Finland, 1976 to 1995. The number of strains with an elevated MIC to ciprofloxacin was assessed by questionnaire. RESULTS: A decrease, from more than 50% in 1986 to 20% in 1993, of strains susceptible to penicillin and tetracycline was observed. The prevalence of PPNG increased from 0% (1976) to 5.7% (1995). In 1995, two strains with a ciprofloxacin MIC of > or = 32 micrograms/ml were reported. No resistance to ceftriaxone or spectinomycin was detected. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of the rarity of gonorrhea and the availability of efficient antimicrobials in Finland, monitoring of the antimicrobial resistance of N. gonorrhoeae remains important.
