Streptococcus pyogenes is a common pathogen which may be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Recent information is not readily available, in Canada, regarding the susceptibility of clinical isolates to penicillin, extended spectrum and/or newer agents. We collected and tested 1003 isolates of S. pyogenes to seven antimicrobial agents and found the following susceptibility rates: azithromycin 97%, ceftriaxone 100%, ciprofloxacin 99.4%, clarithromycin 98.5%, clindamycin 99.9%, erythromycin 96.5% and penicillin 100%. These results indicate that antimicrobial resistance is not yet a problem of S. pyogenes in Canada.
