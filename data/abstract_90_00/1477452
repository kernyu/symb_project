OBJECTIVE: To review the epidemiology, clinical presentation, risk factors for transmission, and pathogenesis of leishmaniasis, as well as current treatment options for this disease. DATA SOURCES/DATA SELECTION: We reviewed unclassified medical-threat briefing material, subject-matter reviews, and case reports from the world's infectious disease literature. We concentrated on literature pertaining to the pathogenesis and management of leishmaniasis indigenous to Southwest Asia. DATA EXTRACTION: Data from subject reviews published in the English language were evaluated. Case reports and clinical trials provided supplemental data on evolving theories and management options. DATA SYNTHESIS: The clinical presentation of leishmaniasis is highly variable. Management relies heavily upon the use of parenteral antimonial drugs. Although these agents are effective in most cases, toxicity and the emergence of resistance limit the usefulness of standard therapies. Alternative treatment modalities include heat, surgical curettage, ketoconazole, metronidazole, pentamidine, rifampin, amphotericin B, aminoglycosides, allopurinol, and immunotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Although the number of reported cases of leishmaniasis in the US has generally been low, there is a possibility that more cases may be reported in the future because of the large number of military personnel returning to this country from endemic areas. Medical personnel, particularly those working in governmental institutions, should be familiar with the pathogenesis of this unusual infection as well as potential treatment options.
