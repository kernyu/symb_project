The pteridine derivative BIBW-22 (4-[N-(2-hydroxy-2-methyl-propyl)-ethanolamino]-2,7-bis(cis-2,6-di methyl-morpholino)-6-phenylpteridine), which had been developed for the treatment of multidrug-resistant cancer and binds to P-glycoprotein, was tested against chloroquine resistant Plasmodium falciparum strains in culture. Based on the result that BIBW-22 enhanced rather than lowered chloroquine resistance in vitro, it is concluded that chloroquine resistance in malaria parasites may not be mechanistically linked to the multidrug-resistant phenotype of chloroquine resistant P. falciparum.
