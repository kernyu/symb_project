The relationship between Wiener's topological index and the antiviral activity of a series of 5-vinylpyrimidine nucleoside analogs has been investigated. Values for more than 100 compounds were computed, and an active range was identified. The predicted activity of each compound was compared with reported antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus type I. Due to significant correlation between antiviral activity and Wiener's topological index, it was possible to predict antiviral activity with an accuracy of approximately 83%.
