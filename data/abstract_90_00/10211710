In order to determine whether the efficacy of moxidectin against Ostertagia circumcincta is enhanced by its persistency, therapeutic efficacy was compared at intervals after treatment and with that of ivermectin, a closely related but more transient endectocide. Groups of 7-month-old New Zealand Romney lambs were infected with a strain of O. circumcincta known to be resistant to moxidectin. At patency of the infections, groups of lambs were treated with either moxidectin or ivermectin at the manufacturer's recommended dosages, or left untreated. At 3, 6 and 10 days post-treatment, faecal egg count was measured and groups of lambs were slaughtered for estimation of adult worm burden. Drug-resistant worm burdens were significantly reduced in those animals treated with moxidectin but not in those treated with ivermectin. No effect of time of slaughter on worm burden was observed with either drug, demonstrating that the higher therapeutic efficacy of moxidectin against this parasite was not due to an increased period of drug exposure. Faecal egg counts in the moxidectin treated animals increased with time after treatment indicating a temporary suppression of egg output by surviving worms. The implications of these findings on selection for anthelmintic resistance are discussed.
