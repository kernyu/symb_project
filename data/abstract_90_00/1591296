Multiple myeloma remains a fatal disease. However, in the last few months new biologic and clinical information has been provided about this disease. In particular, the immunophenotype of myeloma cells seems to indicate, at least in some patients, the possibility of a stem cell involvement in the pathogenesis of myeloma. Moreover, the recent progress in understanding the complex cytokine network has revealed the possibility that myelomatous proliferation is highly influenced by some cytokines such as interleukin-6, interleukin-3, interleukin-2, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Furthermore, it has been shown that the mechanism responsible for the resistance of myeloma cells to chemotherapy may be partially overcome by the use of calcium antagonists associated with quinine. Finally, new insights into the pathogenesis and biology of the disease have been provided by studies of molecular biology and flow cytometry undertaken in multiple myeloma patients. The best conventional induction treatment remains to be defined. However, the increased use, as new therapeutic modalities, of interferon-alpha and transplantation procedures in multiple myeloma opens new hopes of a cure. In the future, a better comprehension of the multiple myeloma biology associated with a wider use of new and more effective therapeutic approaches will certainly improve the natural course of the disease.
