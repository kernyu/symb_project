The ampicillin resistance gene from Shigella flexneri 2a strain YSH6000 was cloned and shown by Southern hybridization analysis to be closely linked to the previously cloned streptomycin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline resistance determinants, which are borne on a chromosomally integrated 99-kb element. Analysis of this chromosomal multi-antibiotic resistance locus revealed that it had a high level of sequence and organizational similarity to an equivalent region of the Shigella R-plasmid, NR1. However, the chromosomal locus exhibited several differences, including the presence of two stretches of sequence derived from IS elements, the precise insertion of a beta-lactamase encoding oxal cassette into the Tn21-borne integron In2, a possible 17.5-kb deletion, and the loss or inactivation of the mercury resistance determinant. Based on these data, it is proposed that the chromosomal locus arose following integration of an NR1-like plasmid.
