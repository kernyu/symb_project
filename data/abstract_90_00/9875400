In an attempt to combine the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-inhibitory capacity of 2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydronucleoside analogues [nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors; NRTI] and non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTI), we have designed, synthesized and evaluated for their anti-HIV activity several heterodimers of the general formula [d4T]-NH-(CH2)n-NH-[imidazo[1,5-b]pyridazine]. The synthesis of these heterodimers was conducted in three parts. The first part focused on the synthesis of the NRTI. The second part was devoted to the NNRTI and the NNRTI linked to appropriate spacers: [NNRTI]-NH-(CH2)n-NH2. In the third part, the condensation between the NRTI and the [NNRTI]-NH-(CH2)n-NH2 was performed. The in vitro inhibitory activities against HIV-1 of the [d4T]-NH-(CH2)n-NH-[imidazo[1,5-b]pyridazine] heterodimers were found to be comparable to that of d4T (stavudine) in HIV-infected cells. Moreover, the heterodimers were endowed with anti-HIV-2 activity and with anti-nevirapine-resistant HIV-1 activity. None of the heterodimers proved markedly cytotoxic to CEM-SS or MT-4 cells. There was not a clear trend toward antiviral potency on lengthening the methylene spacer in the [d4T]-NH-(CH2)n-NH-[imidazo[1,5-b]pyridazine] heterodimers.
