The beta-lactamases in 154 clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains were studied. Susceptibilities to beta-lactam antibiotics, their combination with clavulanate (2:1), and two fluoroquinolones were determined in 24 M. tuberculosis strains susceptible to antimycobacterial drugs and in nine multiresistant strains. All 154 M. tuberculosis isolates showed a single chromosomal beta-lactamase pattern (pI 4.9 and 5.1). M. tuberculosis beta-lactamase hydrolyzes cefotaxime with a maximum rate of 22.5 +/- 2.19 IU/liter (strain 1382). Neither amoxicillin, carbenicillin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, nor aztreonam was active alone. Except for aztreonam, beta-lactam combinations with clavulanate produced better antimycobacterial activity.
