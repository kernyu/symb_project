Five phase variants (PV1 to PV5) of the well-characterized, slime-producing, methicillin-resistant, pathogenic strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis sensu strictu RP62A (ATCC 35984) were isolated by the Congo red agar method. In comparison with the parent strain, the phase variants showed a different colonial morphology on Congo red agar, a strongly reduced adherence capacity, and decreased levels of resistance to methicillin, oxacillin, and penicillin. All phase variants yielded biochemical reaction patterns and profiles in pulsed-field gel electrophoresis identical to those of parent strain RP62A, indicating a common origin. All phase variants proved to have the capacity to shift back to the original phenotype of parent strain RP62A. A search for the resistance mechanisms of strain RP62A revealed beta-lactamase production and the presence of mecA in PV1 to PV5 as well as parent strain RP62A. In Northern blots of total staphylococcal RNA, the phase variants showed no detectable mecA-specific transcription product, whereas parent strain RP62A revealed a strong signal, indicating that mecA transcription is not the mechanism responsible for the decreased methicillin resistance phenotype of phase variants PV1 to PV5.
