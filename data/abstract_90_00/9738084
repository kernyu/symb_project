Representative isolates from 10 distinct extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae that caused hospital outbreaks in the United Kingdom from 1991 to 1994 were examined for relationships between their enzymes and plasmids. The beta-lactamases were identified by a combination of isoelectric focusing and gene sequencing. SHV-2 beta-lactamase was produced by isolates from four outbreaks, SHV-5 was involved in three, and SHV-4, TEM-15, and TEM-26 were involved in one outbreak each. All of the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were encoded by self-transmissible plasmids, with sizes ranging from about 70 to 160 kb. No similarities between the restriction digest patterns of the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-encoding plasmids were detected, except to some extent between those that produced TEM-15 and TEM-26. Thus, outbreaks of hospital infection with these organisms in the United Kingdom from 1991 to 1994 involved distinct organisms and resistance plasmids and appeared to be unrelated.
