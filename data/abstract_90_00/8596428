A promoter which controls expression of the pristinamycin multidrug resistance gene (ptr) in Streptomyces pristinaspiralis could be induced by physiological stresses in both Streptomyces spp. and Escherichia coli. In S. pristinaspiralis, the ptr promoter (Pptr) was induced by pristinamycin I (PI) or pristinamycin II (PII). Streptomyces lividans was adopted as a convenient heterologous host for studies of Pptr regulation since it has no known pristinamycin biosynthetic genes. Two key regulatory features were documented in these studies: many (19 of 70) antibiotics and chemicals with no common targets or structural features induced the Pptr; induction with PI was most efficient during a transition phase when antibiotic biosynthetic genes are switched on. In Streptomyces coelicolor, Pptr activity was similarly inducible by PI and not dependent on sigma factors HrdA, HrdC, or HrdD. In E. coli, Pptr cloned in the bifunctional promoter probe vector pIJ2839 was functional and activated upon entry into stationary phase in the absence of exogenous inducer. Finally, gel-retardation studies demonstrated a Pptr-binding protein in S. lividans (where its activity was PI-inducible), S. coelicolor and S. pristinaespiralis. The fact that this activity was not detected in E. coli suggested the existence of another regulatory system perhaps also present in Streptomyces.
