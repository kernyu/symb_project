Antibiotic susceptibility of 279 strains of gram-positive and gram-negative isolates from patients with bronchopulmonary infections was tested. It was shown that the frequency of resistance to ampicillin and sulacillin amounted to 36.5 and 28.8 per cent respectively. The highest clinical efficacy of sulacillin was observed in the treatment of acute pneumonia (good and satisfactory results in 76.2 and 19 per cent of the cases respectively) and chronic nonobstructive bronchitis (good and satisfactory results in 80 and 16 per cent respectively). The clinical efficacy of sulacillin was somewhat lower in the treatment of chronic obstructive bronchitis (good and satisfactory results in 50 and 30 per cent of the cases respectively). In the treatment of chronic purulent bronchitis no clinical effect was detected in 30 per cent of the cases and in 70 per cent of the cases the results were satisfactory. The total frequency of adverse reactions to sulacillin amounted to 18.8 per cent.
