In a prospective survey of 773 healthy schoolchildren in southern Alberta, Canada, Neisseria polysaccharea was isolated from the pharynxes of only 4 (0.5%) subjects, whereas Neisseria lactamica and Neisseria meningitidis were isolated from 110 (14%) and 15 (2%) children, respectively. These strains of N. polysaccharea, together with three other sporadic isolates from Alberta, Canada, were compared with the type strain from France and strains from Spain and Germany. All strains were phenotypically identical, except that the Canadian and German strains, for which the colistin MICs were 1 mg/liter, failed to grow on Thayer-Martin medium (TMM), whereas the type strain and the Spanish strains, for which the colistin MICs were greater than 7.5 mg/liter, were not inhibited. Multilocus enzyme electrophoresis indicated that six distinct electrophoretic types were present among the seven Canadian strains. Our results show that growth on gonococcal selective media which contain colistin is a variable feature of this taxon.
