We have performed a retrospective study of 103 patients with either peptic ulcer or non-ulcer dyspepsia, infected with metronidazole-sensitive strains of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), who were treated with a combination of tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate and metronidazole for a period of at least two weeks. Dual therapy with tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate plus metronidazole showed similarly high eradication rates (greater than or equal to 80%) of H. pylori from patients irrespective of age, gender or clinical diagnosis. Most importantly, dual therapy achieved a similar eradication rate of H. pylori infection in 41 patients who had previously been treated with tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate alone or in combination with an antibiotic other than metronidazole. It therefore appears that H. pylori does not become resistant to treatment with tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate.
