The effects of four immunosuppressive agents on the in vitro blastogenesis of peripheral blood lymphocytes activated by concanavalin A have been studied using cells from 26 healthy subjects, 34 patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) and 30 kidney transplant recipients. Differences in lymphocyte sensitivity to prednisolone between the healthy subjects and the CRF patients were statistically significant (P less than 0.0002), with impaired sensitivity in CRF. Impaired lymphocyte sensitivity occurred in 3.8% and 52.9% of the healthy and CRF subjects, respectively. Lymphocyte sensitivity to prednisolone, both preoperatively and 3 months post-operatively, was strongly correlated with early allograft rejection during co-administration of prednisolone with cyclosporin or azathioprine. Lymphocyte sensitivity to cyclosporin, azathioprine, and mizoribine in CRF was not significantly less than that in healthy subjects. Since the pharmacokinetics of prednisolone are little altered in renal transplantation, it is concluded that lymphocyte sensitivity specific to prednisolone may be a pharmacodynamic marker characteristic of successful graft survival in patients with histo-incompatibility and/or drug resistance.
