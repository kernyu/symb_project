VRE have spread rapidly since their initial description in 1988. Although much has been learned about the epidemiology of VRE, further studies are needed to establish the reservoirs of the organism and the relative importance of various modes of transmission. There is considerable anecdotal evidence that nosocomial transmission of VRE can be thwarted by using measures such as those recommended by HICPAC, especially if they are implemented promptly after VRE have been introduced into hospitals.
