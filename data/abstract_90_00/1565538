In this study 234 children with shigellosis were evaluated during a 6-year period. The ages ranged from 2 days to 13 years (mean, 3.4 years). Sixty percent of the children were in the 1- to 4-year age group. One hundred four children were hospitalized and 130 were outpatients. Most cases of shigellosis presented during the months of April-May and September-November. Shigella flexneri accounted for 44% and Shigella sonnei for 43% of the isolates. Susceptibility testing showed that 54% were resistant to ampicillin, 72% to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and 77% to tetracycline. Eighty percent were resistant to two or more antimicrobial agents. Morbidity and mortality was higher in children who were initially treated with antimicrobials to which the organism was resistant than in those treated with antimicrobial agent to which the organism was susceptible.
