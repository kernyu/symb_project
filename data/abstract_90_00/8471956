Treatment with the surface-active agent Pluronic F-68, shown to modulate the hemodynamic effects of venous air emboli (VAE) in dogs, may be useful for treatment of VAE in divers. We report on the effects of injections of Pluronic F-68 on responses to continuous air infusion in swine. Pretreatment made no significant difference in any hemodynamic or ventilatory variables, but the rise of pulmonary vascular resistance caused by air infusion was greater in surfactant-treated animals; this was also evident after a second treatment during the air infusion. The small effect of surfactant treatment in our study on swine contrasts the effects reported previously in dogs, and could be due to species-specific differences in lung physiology-anatomy, or due to difference in experimental design. We speculate that the minor changes we observed were caused by deeper penetration of the bubbles into the pulmonary arterial tree after surfactant treatment.
