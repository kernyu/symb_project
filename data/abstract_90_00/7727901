Forty-nine tetracycline and minocycline resistant streptococci of serological group B isolated from humans, cattle, pigs and nutrias were investigated for the presence of genes conferring this combined resistance. Southern blot hybridization of EcoRI-digested chromosomal DNA of the bacteria revealed for 39 of the cultures a hybridization signal with tet(M), for four of the cultures a hybridization signal with tet(O) and for none of the cultures a hybridization signal with the tet(Q) gene probe. The restriction endonuclease digested and blotted DNA of six tetracycline and minocycline resistant group B streptococci did not hybridize with any of the available gene probes. The tet(M) gene probes recognized complementary sequences of EcoRI fragments of approximately 10.5 kb and 21.5 kb, the tet(O) gene probe hybridized with fragments of approximately 19 kb. The hybridization of the tet(M) gene probe in two different patterns appeared to be related to the origin of the cultures.
