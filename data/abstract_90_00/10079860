High therapeutic efficacies of ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefotaxime and azthreonam in the treatment of experimental plague induced by beta-lactamase-producing strains of the plague microbe containing R plasmids RP-1, R57b and R40a were shown to correlate with their in vitro antibacterial activities. The therapeutic efficacy of sulbactam/ampicillin was recorded in the treatment of plague induced by the strain containing R plasmids R57b and R40a (the treatment course of 7 days). However, it was lower when the infection was due to the strain containing plasmid RP-1 (beta-lactamase TEM-2). Cefoperazone was not active in the treatment of experimental plague induced by the strains containing plasmids RP-1 and R57b (beta-lactamases TEM-2 and OXA-3). Ceftriaxone versus the antibiotics tested was considered to be the drug of choice for the etiotropic therapy of plague induced not only by the type strains of the plague microbe but also by its variants with the plasmid pattern resistance to penicillins.
