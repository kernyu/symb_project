The ability of green tea components and other antioxidant compounds to function as antimutagens/antioxidants has been well established, and their role in cancer prevention is supported by numerous epidemiological studies. We have utilized modified Ames tests, superoxide scavenging assays, and assays for protection against DNA scissions to compare and contrast the protective effects of various teas and commercial and laboratory-isolated tea components to those produced by compounds such as resveratrol, selenium, curcumin, vitamins C and E, quercetin dihydrate, sulforaphane, ellagic acid dihydrate, glutathione reduced, trolox, butylated hydroxanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). In Ames tests, employing hydrogen peroxide as a mutagen, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) produced the highest level of protection of all antioxidants tested. Measurement of protection against DNA scissions produced results that again showed that EGCG produced the strongest protective effects. In scavenging assays using a xanthine-xanthine oxidase (enzymatic system), epicatechin gallate (ECG) showed the highest scavenging potential. In a nonenzymatic (phenazine methosulfate-NADH) oxidizing system, EGCG once again showed the strongest effects. The implications of these and similar results are discussed in relation to cancer prevention and prevention of drug/antibiotic resistance.
