We have developed the first system for genetic transformation of the multinuclear yeast Dipodascus magnusii. The system is based on a dominant selectable marker and an autonomously replicating sequence. We have constructed a plasmid vector which contains a marker conferring resistance to zeocin and the segment of non-transcribed spacer of D. magnusii ribosomal DNA which supports the autonomous replication of plasmid DNA in yeast cells. Plasmid DNA has been transferred into D. magnusii cells by electroporation.
