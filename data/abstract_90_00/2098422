Studies were carried out in some areas of Assam, Nagaland, West Bengal and Mizoram where chloroquine resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum were present during 1983 and 1984, to see the efficacy of treatment of P. falciparum cases with SLP alone or with quinine sulphate. The findings have indicated that SLP in the dosage of sulfalene (1000 mg) + Pyrimethamine (50 mg) is suitable for treatment of P. falciparum cases not responding to chloroquine therapy in N.E. India. Treatment with sulfalene (1500 mg) + Pyrimethamine (75 mg) has no advantage over the SLP (1000 + 50) mg. Combination of quinine (1000 mg x 3 days) + SLP (1000 + 50) mg is better with 100 per cent cure rate. In Karhi Anglong district (Manja PHC) of Assam response to these drug combination is however less.
