We characterized a Trichoderma viride strain that is resistant to the antimitotic drug methyl benzimidazole-2-yl-carbamate (MBC). This species has two beta-tubulin genes (tub1 and tub2) and by reverse genetics we showed that a mutation in the tub2 gene confers MBC resistance in this strain. Comparison of the tub2 sequence of the mutant strain with that of the wild type revealed that a single amino acid substitution of tyrosine for histidine at a position 6 is responsible for the MBC tolerance. Furthermore, we showed that this gene can be used as a homologous dominant selectable marker in T. viride transformation. Both tubulin genes were completely sequenced. They differ by 48 residues and the degree of identity between their deduced amino acid sequences is 86.3%.
