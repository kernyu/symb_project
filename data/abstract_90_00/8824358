Trimetrexate (TMQ) is a synthetic folate antagonist that has demonstrated non-cross resistance with methotrexate in preclinical screens. A phase II trial was performed with TMQ given to patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. TMQ was administered as an i.v. bolus on a daily x 5 schedule, every 3 weeks; a starting dose of 12 mg/m2 was used for patients with no prior irradiation, and of 8 mg/m2 for patients with prior irradiation. Twenty-four patients were entered onto study, with 23 patients eligible, and a median of 2 courses of TMQ administered per patient. Twenty-three patients were evaluable for toxicity. Toxicities of SWOG grade > or = 3 included granulocytopenia (9 patients), leukopenia (7 patients), thrombocytopenia (4 patients), anemia (3 patients), mucositis (3 patients), nausea and vomiting (2 patients), dermatitis (1 patient), diarrhea (1 patient), and fever (1 patient). Fifteen patients had some hematologic toxicity, and eleven patients had hematologic toxicity of grade > or = 3. Two treatment related deaths occurred in association with myelosuppression. One patient achieved a complete response and one patient achieved a partial response, with response durations of 8.5 months and 6 months, respectively. The overall response rate was 8% [95% confidence interval of 1 to 28%], with a median survival for the 23 eligible patients of 5.1 months.
