Activated protein C resistance is the most frequent cause of venous thrombosis. We describe a patient with extensive ulcerations and severe lymphedema of the legs after recurrent thrombosis. Laboratory tests revealed a pathologic activated protein C resistance and a reduced functional protein S. The underlying genetic defect was identified as a heterozygous coagulation factor V mutation. A combined therapeutic approach of intermittent compression, repeated debridements and systemic antibiotics resulted in marked improvement of both lymphedema and leg ulcers.
