The size of the antibiotic market in developing countries is double that seen in developed countries. There are some valid reasons for this difference, one of which is the higher frequency of diverse infections in the developing world. However, other factors are involved: for example, antibiotics are available without prescription, package insert information is poor, and there is no national antibiotic usage programme, all of which encourage inappropriate antibacterial use. When an antibiotic becomes widely prescribed by physicians, this is interpreted by the general public as meaning that the antibiotic is useful for all types of infections and the process of automedication begins. The newer quinolones, other new antibiotics, and indeed all antimicrobials should be available only by prescription. A package insert that includes all pertinent information should be provided, and each country should implement a comprehensive national antibiotic usage programme. Only through these measures will bacterial resistance be controlled and the effectiveness of each antibiotic class be maintained.
