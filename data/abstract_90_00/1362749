An elderly lady was admitted to hospital for elective resection of an adenocarcinoma of the colon. Following an anastomotic leak she developed intra-abdominal sepsis and underwent abdominal drainage of pus. During recovery from her second operation, she developed pneumonia and a bacteraemia due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). She was treated with vancomycin and co-trimoxazole and survived without further sequelae. Details of the development and treatment of this case are discussed. Procedures for the control and eradication of MRSA infections in hospitals are reviewed.
