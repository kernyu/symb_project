Increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant gram-negative organisms has led to a rise in clinically significant infections with these organisms and an increasing therapeutic dilemma. We present a case of a neurosurgical patient who developed ventriculoperitoneal shunt-associated ventriculitis due to ceftazidime-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae susceptible to cefepime, imipenem, meropenem, and polymyxin B only. Successful management was accomplished by removal of the shunt and therapy with systemic meropenem and intraventricular polymyxin B. Rapid cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sterilization occurred, with CSF bactericidal titers of 1:32 to 1:128. Polymyxin B should be considered as adjunctive therapy for life-threatening multidrug-resistant gram-negative infections. Prior literature on use of intrathecal polymyxin B in therapy for meningitis supports its potential efficacy.
