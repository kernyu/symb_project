One hundred and thirty strains of Corynebacterium diphtheriae isolated in St. Petersburg (42 toxigenic and 88 nontoxigenic) were tested with the method of serial dilutions in solid media for their susceptibility to 20 antibacterial drugs. The MICs of the drugs for the isolates ranged from < or = 0.015 to > or = 32.0 micrograms/ml. 13 per cent of the isolates was resistant at least to one antibacterial drug. The isolates resistant to erythromycin (11.5 per cent), lincomycin (11.5 per cent) and trimethoprim (8.5 per cent) were most frequent. 3 isolates (2.3 per cent) had multiple resistance to 8 drugs: benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, lincomycin, trimethoprim, and nitroxolin. No significant differences in the susceptibility of the toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains of C. diphtheriae were detected. Gentamicin, rifampicin, tetracycline, doxycycline and pefloxacin were the most active antibiotics.
