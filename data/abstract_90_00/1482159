The influence of long-term ceftriaxone administration on the emergence of Clostridium difficile was studied with 80 patients receiving ceftriaxone for 14 days. In five patients (6.3%) C. difficile was cultured. The appearance of gastrointestinal disturbances during treatment with ceftriaxone was common, but the rate of emergence of C. difficile in immunocompetent patients was not high.
