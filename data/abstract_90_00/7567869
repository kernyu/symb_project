Biological properties of M. tuberculosis were investigated in 265 patients with tuberculosis of respiratory organs. Slow but more massive growth in culture medium is characteristic for drug-resistant M.tuberculosis. 32 patients discharging drug-resistant M.tuberculosis had unstable drug resistance to isoniazid, kanamycin, ethambutol and streptomycin. It is suggested that drug-resistant M.tuberculosis by virulence are similar to sensitive varieties.
