A Candida (Torulopsis) glabrata strain (B57149) became resistant to fluconazole after a patient carrying the organism was treated with the drug at 400 mg once daily for 9 days. Growth of the pretreatment isolate (B57148) was inhibited by 50% with 0.67 microM ketoconazole, 1.0 microM itraconazole, and 43 microM fluconazole, whereas growth of B57149 was inhibited slightly by 10 microM ketoconazole but was unaffected by 10 microM itraconazole or 100 microM fluconazole. This indicates cross-resistance to all three azole antifungal agents. The cellular fluconazole content of B57149 was from 1.5- to 3-fold lower than that of B57148, suggesting a difference in drug uptake between the strains. However, this difference was smaller than the measured difference in susceptibility and, therefore, cannot fully explain the fluconazole resistance of B57149. Moreover, the intracellular contents of ketoconazole and itraconazole differed by less than twofold between the strains, so that uptake differences did not account for the azole cross-resistance of B57149. The microsomal cytochrome P-450 content of B57149 was about twice that of B57148, a difference quantitatively similar to the increased subcellular ergosterol synthesis from mevalonate or lanosterol. These results indicate that the level of P-450-dependent 14 alpha-demethylation of lanosterol is higher in B57149. Increased ergosterol synthesis was also seen in intact B57149 cells, and this coincided with a decreased susceptibility of B57149 toward all three azoles and amphotericin B. B57149 also had higher squalene epoxidase activity, and thus, more terbinafine was needed to inhibit the synthesis of 2,3-oxidosqualene from squalene. P-450 content and ergosterol synthesis both decreased when isolate B57149 was subcultured repeatedly on drug-free medium. This repeated subculture also fully restored the strain's itraconazole susceptibility, but only partly increased its susceptibility to fluconazole. The results suggest that both lower fluconazole uptake and increased P-450-dependent ergosterol synthesis are involved in the mechanism of fluconazole resistance but that only the increased ergosterol synthesis contributes to itraconazole cross-resistance.
