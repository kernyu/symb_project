The results of testing 501 specimens of pathological materials containing enterobacteria from 382 patients with various purulent inflammatory diseases treated at the Tashkent Branch of the Research Centre of Surgery in 1989-1991 were analyzed. The findings showed that Enterobacter spp., Escherichia spp. and Proteus spp. played the main role in the etiology of the surgical infections (46.9, 19.4 and 16.2 per cent respectively). Some enterobacteria were tested for their susceptibility to antimicrobial drugs. Enterobacteria resistant to penicillins (81.8-89.9 per cent), aminoglycosides (55.4-75 per cent), tetracyclines (57.1-73.2 per cent), clindamycin (95.7 per cent), rifampicin (87.5 per cent), polymyxin (92.9 per cent) and biseptol (74.6 per cent) were especially frequent. The study showed that claforan, a 3rd generation cephalosporin, and dioxidin were the most active agents despite the species: the number of the isolates resistant to them amounted to 17.9 and 34.7 per cent respectively.
