The association between insulin resistance and coronary heart disease (CHD) is strong in the British Indian-Asian population. Adipocyte metabolism may contribute to both insulin resistance and CHD. We examined insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes and in vivo insulin sensitivity using the fasting insulin resistance index (FIRI) in 60 subjects (45 Caucasian and 15 Asian) with CHD and 30 Caucasian subjects without CHD. In 25 CHD subjects (18 Caucasian and 7 Asian), the relationship between adipocyte insulin sensitivity and non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) suppression to oral glucose was examined. Compared with controls, the CHD subjects had higher values of fasting insulin [51 (46 to 54) pmol l(-1) vs 36 (31 to 41) pmol l(-1) p< 0.01] and FIRI [1.65 (1.5 to 1.79) vs 1.06 (0.89 to 1.23), p < 0.01]. Among the CHD subjects, the Asians had higher values than Caucasian [insulin 58 (48 to 67) pmol l(-1) vs 48 (44 to 53) pmol l(-1) p < 0.01, FIRI 1.89 (1.44 to 2.13) vs 1.62 (1.4 to 1.79), p< 0.01)]. Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes was lower in the CHD than control subjects [56 (50 to 62) vs 115 (75 to 132) attomol min(-1).mm2, p < 0.05], being most reduced among the Asians. It was positively correlated with postprandial NEFA suppression and negatively with insulin release. In conclusion, abnormalities of adipocyte function and insulin sensitivity occur in CHD and may contribute to its aetiology.
