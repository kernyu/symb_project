A total of 24 cases of recalcitrant trichomoniasis were reported from 18 centres widely scattered throughout the UK. Most cases had received numerous courses of unsuccessful treatment. Nine (75%) of 12 tested isolates had a decreased susceptibility to metronidazole. Local laboratories were often unable to evaluate fully trichomonal isolates and it is recommended that consideration be given to the establishment of a national reference laboratory. Although there were no universal cures, successful alternatives to conventional treatments are detailed.
