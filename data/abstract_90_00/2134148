499 N. meningitidis strains were studied, 454 being isolated from CSF and blood and 45 from nasopharynx. Meningococcal serogroup A was prevalent in 1986-1988, having a decreasing tendency from 84.90% in 1987 to 45.0% in 1989. Serogroup C increased from 0.86% in 1986 to 15% in 1989. All strains, examined by diffusiometric method, were sensitive to ampicillin, cephalotin, chloramphenicol and rifampin. For tetracycline, resistance ranged from 2.28 to 6.0% in 1987-1989. The frequency of 52.0-72.14% resistant to sulphamides strains seems to be due to serogroup A prevalence. Six N. meningitidis strains, isolated in 1989, proved to be moderately resistant to penicillin with MIC greater than or equal to 0.1 mcg/ml. The results indicate the necessity of a continuous surveillance of meningococcal infection, both from the point of view of serogroup circulation and also of antibiotics sensitivity.
