The in vitro activity of FCE 22101 against 97 Gram-negative aerobic nosocomial isolates was compared with that of ceftriaxone using the agar dilution method. Thirty-four (79%) of the 43 ceftriaxone resistant (MIC > 16 mg/l) isolates were found to be FCE 22101 susceptible (MIC < or = 8 mg/l), while of the ceftriaxone susceptible isolates, only seven Enterobacter cloacae and one Serratia spp strain were FCE 22101 resistant. The new penem may offer an alternative for treating nosocomial infections due to aerobic Gram-negative strains resistant to third generation cephalosporins, provided that clinical studies confirm its clinical usefulness.
