In 1996-1997 a multicentre study was carried out on 450 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains to compare the MICs and susceptibility categories obtained with the Etest (AB Biodisk) used under routine conditions in 22 hospital laboratories in the Rhone-Alpes region, France, with those obtained by the reference technique of agar dilution performed in a single coordinating centre. Each laboratory detected penicillin resistant pneumococci (PRP) by the oxacillin disk method (1 microgram and 5 micrograms) and determined the MICs of penicillin G (PG), amoxycillin (AMX) and cefotaxime (CTX) by the Etest. All the PRP strains were collected in the coordinating centre where MICs were carried out. The strains were classified as susceptible (S), intermediate (I) and resistant (R) according to the CASFM criteria (Comite de l'Antibiogramme de la Societe Francaise de Microbiologie). The concordance results based on susceptibility categories are as follows: PG = 67.6%, AMX = 63.6%, CTX = 71.5%. Minor errors are as follows: PG = 31.2%, AMX = 36%, CTX = 28.5%. Major and very major errors are rare (0% to 0.6%). Agreement within 1 log2 dilution was obtained for about 80% of the strains. The minor errors results from strains clustering near the breakpoints 1 mg/l (PG) and 0.5 mg/l (AMX, CTX), and from practical difficulties in routine use of the Etest. These discrepancies may result in severe therapeutic problems. This study confirms the limits of the Etest. The authors insist on standardization and rigorous use of the Etest under routine conditions.
