We determined the level of susceptibility of Trypanosoma brucei brucei to the aminoglycoside G418 in vivo and demonstrated that it is possible to select for G418-resistant transfected T. brucei brucei bloodstream parasites in a mouse host by inoculating the drug intraperitoneally at doses between 40 and 80 mg/kg of body weight daily for 3 days. The ability to select for transfectants in vivo offers new possibilities for studies on genetic recombination in these parasites.
