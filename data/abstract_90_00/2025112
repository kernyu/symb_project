The routinely used antibiotics and antiseptics were compared with the same staphylococcal isolates by MIC ranges, the mean MIC for the strains, proportion of the variants resistant to the drugs, distribution of the strains by the resistance spectra and the number increase rate for the resistant variants in natural populations within 5-10-year periods. It was concluded that when used locally the antiseptics had some advantages over the antibiotics especially with respect to hospital strains. The authors believe that in developing new drugs, ++re-estimation of the routinely used ones, choosing the optimal drug for a particular case it is more important to consider the heterogeneity of microbial populations, the frequency of resistant variants and activity of the mechanisms of their selection under hospital conditions.
