The Showa disk susceptibility test using two penicillinase-resistant penicillins, oxacillin and methicillin, was evaluated to discriminate between the strains of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin (MRSA) and those susceptible (MSSA) in the multi-center trials. The study included 651 clinical isolates of S. aureus, comprising of 329 MRSA and 322 MSSA isolates. The inhibitory zone diameters by Showa disks to oxacillin and methicillin highly correlated with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) determined by standard agar dilutions with 0.961 and 0.930 correlation coefficients, respectively. Of 651 duplicate MIC determinations, 79.9% (oxacillin) and 80.3% (methicillin) were within +/- 1 log2 dilutions with each other. When Showa oxacillin and methicillin disks were incubated at 35 degrees C, sensitivity and specificity of oxacillin to detect MRSA were 95.4% and 98.1%, and those of methicillin were 94.8% and 95.2%. When tested on agar plates supplemented with 5% NaCl, sensitivity and specificity markedly improved to > 97%. Also, when incubated at 30 degrees C, sensitivity and specificity became to nearly 100%. Of 329 MRSA isolates, the interpretive criteria combined with incubation at 30 degrees C and testing onto 5% NaCl supplemented agar plates could correctly identify 324 (98.5%) and 329 (100%) isolates, respectively. In conclusion, when the Showa oxacillin and methicillin disk susceptibility tests were employed exactly according to the manufacturer's instruction, the test performances to detect MRSA were enough reliable to screen MRSA isolates in clinical microbiology laboratories.
