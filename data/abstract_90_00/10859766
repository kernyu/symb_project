Percentages of primary and acquired resistance to anti-tuberculosis drugs provide an epidemiological indicator useful for assessing national anti-tuberculosis programs. Rifampicin and isoniazide are widely used in countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis. In tropical Africa, these drugs are the mainstay treatment for tuberculosis, used both in the initial and long-term regimens. Simultaneous resistance to these two antibiotics would seriously jeopardize therapeutic efficacy. We studied simultaneous rifampicin and isoniazide resistance in patients hospitalized for tuberculosis in the respiratory disease unit of the Treichville University hospital in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was isolated in 8 patients. All the strains isolated were resistant to streptomycin. History taking revealed that resistance was observed at the initial prescription in 6 cases. A notion of contagion was present in 4 cases. Six patients were HIV-positive. Surveillance of resistance to anti-tuberculosis drugs is helpful in detecting early changes which could compromise the efficacy of the therapeutic scheme.
