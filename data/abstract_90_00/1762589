In this study, 231 Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus (MRS) and 76 Methicillin-Susceptible Staphylococcus (MSS) strains were investigated. 23 antibiotics were tested by using Modified Kirby-Bauer Technique. The highest resistance ration in MRS strains were found for lincomycin, clindamycin and ampicillin with the ratios of 61.0%, 59.3%, and 56.2% respectively. And the lowest resistance ratios were measured for vancomycin, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin 0.5%, 8.2%, 10.8% respectively. It was found that, resistance of MRS strains to 17 antibiotics were significantly higher than resistance of MSS strains, but not for sulbactam-ampicillin, cefoperazone, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and netilmicin.
