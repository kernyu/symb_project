More then 50 years of antibiotic era has brought to clinical use many antibiotics with, specific and also with broad spectrum activity. Excessive use of antibiotics brought and brings serious problems--the resistance of many important bacteria and so the loss of effectivity of these scarce substances. Significant negative role in this process has the transferability of the resistance genes between bacteria. Bacterial strains are able to accept block of genes for multiresistance, exchange them inter species and spread to susceptible ones. There is an important task for the 3rd millennium to reduce the prevalence of the antibiotic resistance. Changes of the empiric treatment regiments (reduction in antibiotic use, antibiotic rotation, infection control, monitoring of resistance) and the strict hospital hygiene could help to solve the problems of antibiotic resistance in the future.
