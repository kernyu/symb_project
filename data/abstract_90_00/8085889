The data on the value of pharmacokinetic parameters and pharmacologic properties of antibiotics for the development of optimal regimens of antibacterial therapy are presented. The impact of various symptoms and syndromes of purulent septic processes (uremia, anemia, obesity or hyperbilirubinemia) on antibiotic pharmacokinetics is discussed. Approaches to the improvement of schemes for antibiotic therapy of various pathological conditions are noted. Procedures (a microbiological one and those with the use of apparatus) for the determination of antibiotic concentrations in serum and tissues are described. Factors useful for the development of individual regimens of antibiotic therapy of various nosologic forms of infectious inflammatory diseases are indicated: some indices characterizing susceptibility of the pathogen to the drug used (minimum antibacterial, minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations), difficulties with their interpretation (the phenomena of the pathogen persistence, microbial tolerance and Eagle's effect), environmental influences in the infection foci on the drug concentration.
