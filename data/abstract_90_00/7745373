This case-control study examined the impact of HIV infection on clinical presentation, response to treatment, and outcome of pulmonary tuberculosis. Symptoms, radiographic pattern, sputum direct smear, drug susceptibility, treatment outcome and adverse reactions of 88 HIV-infected patients with newly-diagnosed, culture-proved, untreated pulmonary tuberculosis were compared with those of age and gender-matched HIV-seronegative patients. No differences in the frequency of pyrexia, dyspnoea, cough or haemoptysis were evident. Cavitary lesions and upper zone infiltrates were observed significantly less often in the HIV-infected group (p = 0.02 and 0.01, respectively). Direct smear positivity was comparable in the 2 groups. The resistance rates to antituberculous drugs were not different except for Streptomycin which was higher among the HIV-infected patients (p = 0.01). Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions and drug-induced hepatitis occurred more often in the HIV-seropositive group, albeit not reaching statistical significance. Default was much higher in the HIV-infected patients (33%); however, the culture conversion rate was satisfactory among those completed treatment. Twelve HIV-infected patients died during the course of treatment, four of whom as a result of tuberculosis. Based on these observations, physicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for tuberculosis among HIV-seropositive patients for short-course chemotherapy to be promptly instituted.
