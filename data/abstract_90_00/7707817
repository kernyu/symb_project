There is concern that drug-resistant tuberculosis is increasing and may be concentrated among HIV-positive patients. Little information is available from developing countries, where surveillance studies are often unable to distinguish resistance in previously untreated patients (initial resistance) from resistance acquired following drug therapy, and where information on the HIV status of the patients is rare. Initial resistance patterns reflect the strains being transmitted in the community. We have studied patterns of resistance in northern Malawi, where the Lepra Evaluation Project has been collecting data on drug resistance since 1986. Initial drug sensitivity results were available for 373 new cases of tuberculosis. Initial resistance to at least one drug was found in 44 of these patients (11.8%, 95% CI 8.5-15.1): 13 were resistant to streptomycin alone, 13 to isoniazid alone, and 17 to more than one drug. Only 3 patients showed initial rifampicin resistance-1 in isolation, 1 in combination with streptomycin, and 1 with triple resistance. Drug resistance was not related to age, sex, or HIV status of the patient and there was no evidence of any increase over the period studied. There was no evidence of geographic clustering of the resistant strains, or of any increased risk of resistant strains in households with previous tuberculosis cases. Acquired resistance during follow-up was found in 5 of 329 patients with documented initially fully sensitive strains. 5 patients with initial resistance seemed to show reversion to sensitivity. The absence of an increase in drug resistance, despite an increase in tuberculosis cases over the period, is encouraging for the control programme. It emphasises the need to collect information from many areas before assuming that increases in antituberculosis drug resistance are occurring worldwide.
