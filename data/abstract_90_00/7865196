In recent years the frequency and spectrum of antibiotic resistant microorganisms have dramatically increased worldwide. In same cases certain infections turned out to be essentially untreatable with antimicrobial drugs. The antibiotic resistance and its transmissibility among different microorganisms poses serious problems for the near future. It is thus important to search and develop rapidly new antimicrobial drugs with improved activity and able to overcome resistance mechanisms. A more prudent and appropriate use of antimicrobial drug in humans and animals is also recommend.
