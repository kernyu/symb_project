The comparison of the in vitro-susceptibility of Candida isolates collected from the oral cavity of different groups of patients to fluconazole ist reported. The isolates of HIV-patients treated with fluconazole, HIV-patients and dermatological patients without fluconazole exposure were investigated. The in vitro-susceptibility of these isolates was determined by microdilution test and agar diffusion test. 88.7% of the 194 Candida isolates were susceptible in vitro, 6.7% less sensitive and 4.6% resistant to fluconazole. Comparing the susceptibility within the groups there was a higher number of isolates less sensitive (14.7%) and resistant (11.8%) to fluconazole in the group of HIV-patients treated with fluconazole than in the other 2 groups without treatment. The less sensitive isolates were 4 C. albicans and 6 C. glabrata. The resistant isolates were 2 C. albicans, 2 C. glabrata and 4 C. krusei. In the group of HIV-patients without fluconazole exposure there were only 2.7% of the isolates less sensitive (2 C. glabrata) and 1.4% resistant to fluconazole (1 C. glabrata). In dermatological patients there were 2% of the isolates less sensitive (2 C. glabrata) and no resistant isolate. Resistance both in vivo and in vitro was found in 2 patients.
