The ubiquinol:cytochrome c reductase activity of Paracentrotus lividus mitochondria is relatively insensitive to the specific inhibitors myxothiazol and mucidin. The I50 of myxothiazol and mucidin are three and two orders of magnitude higher, respectively, in P. lividus than in bovine heart mitochondria. The natural resistance of the P. lividus reductase to these inhibitors can be correlated with a single amino replacement, an alanine for a glycine at position 143, in the sequence of cytochrome b. This position is located in a conserved region of the molecule, believed to be important in the oxidation of ubiquinol by the reductase.
