A series of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS)-resistant pneumococcal isolates of a variety of serotypes was examined and was found to contain Tn917-like elements by DNA-DNA hybridization. Like Tn1545, Tn917 also encodes an ermAM gene but does not mediate resistance to other antimicrobial agents. Furthermore, nucleotide sequence analyses of the DNAs flanking three of the Tn917-like elements revealed that they were inserted into orf9 of a Tn916-like element in a composite transposon-like structure (Tn3872). Other MLS-resistant strains appeared to contain Tn1545-like elements that had suffered a deletion of sequences including the aphA-3 sequences responsible for kanamycin resistance. Thus, the MLS resistance phenotype in pneumococci appears to be mediated by the ermAM present on a much wider variety of genetic elements than was previously appreciated.
