Modulating agents that circumvent the Plasmodium falciparum resistance to antimalarials are components without any intrinsic antimalarial activity but able, in association with a standard antimalarial drug, to restore the sensitivity of Plasmodium falciparum to this drug. Two hypotheses are forwarded about their possible mechanisms of action : the mechanisms involving the inhibition of the drug efflux and the mechanisms involving the inhibition of antimalarial drug metabolic degradation. None of these mechanisms is able to alone explain the effect of all modulating agents. The future use prospects of these compounds are limited by their in vivo toxicity. That relevant to the calcium channels blockers seems to be circumvented by the use of dextro-enantiomers. A toxicity relevant to a possible accumulation of the antimalarial in healthy, non target cells must be also suspected. Moreover the use of these agents evidences a socio-economic problem : a complete new development of the association (antimalaria plus modulatin drugs) is needed and that, in developing countries. Nevertheless, the agents modulating the Plasmodium falciparum resistance are a new approach for the treatment of resistant malaria which might give a recrudescence of activity to the old antimalarials as chloroquine.
