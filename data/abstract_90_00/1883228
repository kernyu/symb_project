A comparative biochemical study was performed on some strains of Candida rhagii and on strains belonging to different subgroups of Candida parapsilosis. Measurements of alcohol dehydrogenase activity, resistance to drugs and occurrence of an alternative pathway enabled us to confirm the classification between several subgroups within the C. parapsilosis species.
