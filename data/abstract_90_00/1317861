It was shown that Tn551 inactivation of two chromosomal (so-called auxiliary) loci other than the mec gene result in a dramatic reduction of methicillin resistance and decreased cell wall turnover and autolytic capacity in a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain (de Jonge, B. L. M., de Lencastre, H., and Tomasz, A. (1990) J. Bacteriol. 173, 1105-1110). To understand the mechanistic basis of these phenomena we have examined the status of the autolytic enzymes and the muropeptide composition of peptidoglycan using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectral analyses. While no differences could be detected in the number of autolytic hydrolases, the mutants showed major changes in peptidoglycan composition. Nine prominent muropeptides of the parental strain each carrying a pentaglycyl substituent were missing from the cell wall of one group of mutants. The second mutant lacked four parental muropeptides which were composed of the unsubstituted disaccharide pentapeptide and its alanyl-tetraglycine derivative. The auxiliary genes are genetic determinants involved with the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan precursors, the presence of which in the cell wall may be needed for optimal cell wall turnover.
