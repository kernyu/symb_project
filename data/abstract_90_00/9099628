Compared with exponential growing bacteria, carbohydrate-starved cells of Enterococcus faecalis exhibit a high level of resistance to sodium hypochlorite with maximal resistance observed in cultures entering stationary phase. Chloramphenicol treatment, at various stages of growing phase, does not abolish the hypochlorite resistance of starved cells. However, Enterococcus faecalis conditioned by low sodium hypochlorite concentrations does not develop tolerance towards a lethal dose of the disinfectant. Two-dimensional gel analysis shows that protein synthesis is drastically turned off by hypochlorite treatment, whereas synthesis of a few proteins is enhanced by a low concentration of this chemical agent.
