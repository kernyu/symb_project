Lysozyme, a bacteriolytic protein discovered by Fleming in 1922 and found to be phylogenetically ancient and almost ubiquitous among living organisms, is probably the most studied enzyme in biology and medicine. Evidence of its involvement in resistance to bacterial infection is compelling but remains indirect. Muramyl peptides (fragments of bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan) exert many effects on the immune system and the CNS, and appear to contribute to non-specific resistance to infection, fever, fatigue, and the pathogenesis of bacterial infection. Synthetic muramyl peptide analogues are currently used as adjuvants in vaccine trials in humans. Several pathological conditions are associated with changes in lysozyme concentrations, and egg-white lysozyme treatment has been tried on a small scale. With the cloning of the human lysozyme gene in yeast cells the enzyme can now be produced on a large scale, which will enable its therapeutic applications to be evaluated.
