The in vitro antifungal activity of D0870 against eight isolates of fluconazole-resistant Candida albicans was compared with that of itraconazole, ketoconazole and miconazole. The colorimetric MTT [3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H tetrazolium bromide] assay was used to assess the antifungal activities. The 50% minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC50) of D0870 was below 0.031 microgram ml-1 for seven isolates and 0.25 microgram ml-1 for one isolate. The activity of D0870 was superior to that of the other azoles. Ketoconazole was the most effective azole next to D0870. Therefore, the new bis-triazole, D0870, is expected to be promising for the therapy of fluconazole-resistant candidosis. The present data also confirmed that the MTT assay may be useful for evaluation of resistance and detection of resistant C. albicans.
