To study the effect of drug resistance on the response of stage IV astrocytomas to interferon, a human glioblastoma multiforme cell line, GBM-18, was transfected with an expression-vector plasmid containing a human multidrug resistance (MDR) gene (pHaMDR1/A), and clones surviving in colchicine were isolated. GBM-18 multidrug-resistant subclones displayed cross-resistance to other chemotherapeutic agents, including vincristine, doxorubicin, and dactinomycin. The multidrug-resistant phenotype was reversible when GBM-18 multidrug-resistant cells were cultured in colchicine and the calcium-channel blocker verapamil. The level of the MDR1 gene (also known as PGY1) message was increased in GBM-18 multidrug-resistant cells selected for increased resistance to colchicine, and this effect was not correlated with an amplification of the MDR1 gene. In both parental GBM-18 and GBM-18 multidrug-resistant cells, growth was suppressed to a greater degree when cultures were treated with the combination of fibroblast interferon (IFN-beta) and immune interferon (IFN-gamma). Parental cells and multidrug-resistant subclones varied in their de novo and/or interferon-modulated expression of HLA class I and class II antigens, a high-molecular-weight melanoma-associated antigen, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). Of the antigens tested, ICAM-1 and HLA class I antigens were the most sensitive to enhanced expression induced by IFN-beta and IFN-gamma when used alone or in combination. The results of the present study indicate that multidrug-resistant human glioblastoma multiforme cells retain their increased sensitivity to the antiproliferative activity of the combination of IFN-beta plus IFN-gamma, and differences in antigenic phenotype are apparent in independent multidrug-resistant glioblastoma multiforme clones.
