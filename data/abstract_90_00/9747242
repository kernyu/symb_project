INTRODUCTION: High-dose corticosteroids are the primary means of controlling alarming hemangiomas. However, only 2/3 of these life-threatening hemangiomas regress or are stabilized with corticosteroids: and for others there is no regularly safe and effective treatment. Contradictory publications have been reported about the efficacy of interferon (INF) alpha in hemangiomas, we report our experience concerning the management of 7 cases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seven infants have been treated with INF alpha-2b in our Pediatric Dermatology Unit. All hemangiomas were corticosteroid resistant. Hemangiomas were located on head and neck in 6 cases and on lower limb in one case in association with platelet trapping syndrome. Mean age at beginning of treatment was 7.5 months and mean duration of treatment was 5 months. INF alpha-2b was given daily in subcutaneous injections of 3 millions units per square meter of body surface area. RESULTS: After one month of treatment, 2 cases of facial hemangiomas showed a dramatic improvement, and INF alpha-2b was maintained for one year. One case was stabilized, but INF was ineffective in 3 cases after 2 months of treatment (the child with platelet trapping syndrome died at 4 months of age). The treatment had to be stopped in one case because of hepatitis. No long term side effects were noted with a mean follow-up of 27 months. CONCLUSION: INF alpha can be an interesting alternative therapy for infantile hemangiomas. However, only a minority of patients can be considered as excellent responders at current dosages and long term secondary effects cannot be excluded.
