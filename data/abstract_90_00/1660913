We examined the mechanism by which Polyriboinosinic:Polyribocytidylic acid (Poly I:C) augments resistance of thioglycolate-elicited inflammatory macrophages to infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). We show that Poly I:C-induced antiviral activity is completely abrogated by antibodies to interferon-beta (IFN-beta) whereas antibodies to other interferons or to other cytokines have no effect. Furthermore, treatment of inflammatory macrophages with exogenous IFN renders them resistant to HSV-1, whereas treatment with other cytokines does not. In addition, we demonstrate that supernatants from macrophages treated with Poly I:C contain IFN-beta but not IFN-alpha. Taken together these data indicate that the antiviral effects of Poly I:C in inflammatory macrophages are mediated solely by IFN-beta, which acts in an autocrine manner to induce resistance to HSV-1.
