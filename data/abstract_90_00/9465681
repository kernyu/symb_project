The ganciclovir(GCV)-resistant human cytomegaloviruses(HCMV) result from the mutation(s) in either the UL97 phosphotransferase gene, or UL54 DNA polymerase gene, or both. Majority of clinical isolates of GCV-resistant mutant had mutations in the UL97 gene. Because the mutations in the UL97 gene cluster in two regions, sudomain VI and IX, it is almost possible to identify a GCV-resistant mutant by PCR-based DNA analysis. On the contrary, only a few mutants which had mutation(s) in the UL54 DNA polymerase have been analyzed. Therefore, to establish the system which identifies the mutation in UL54 DNA polymerase gene, the more analysis of this type of mutants is required.
