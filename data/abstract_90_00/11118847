Of more than 3500 isolates of enterobacteriaceae, 48-69% were resistant to aminopenicillins and 11-45% to amoxycillin+clavulanic acid. Resistance to second and third generation cephalosporins was present in 11-17 and 3-8% of Escherichia coli, 47-56 and 15-52% of Klebsiella-Enterobacter, 36-57 and 16-27% of Proteus, Providencia and Morganella isolates. Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains varied in their resistance to antipseudomonal beta-lactams. Isoelectric points, inhibitor profiles and substrate profiles of beta-lactamases extracted from representatives of the resistant strains indicated that the resistance was mainly due to the hyperproduction of chromosomally encoded AmpC beta-lactamases. This was confirmed by plasmid profile and PCR investigations. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and metallo-penicillinase producing strains were not found. One Pseudomonas maltophilia strain produced an oxacillinase.
