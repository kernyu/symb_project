Azithromycin is a new semisynthetic, acid stable C15 macrolid. In our study, we compared in vitro activity of azithromycin with 6 other antibiotics usually recommended for treatment of N. gonorrhoeae infections: erythromycin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, ceftriaxone, spectinomycin, ciprofloxacin. 100 strains have been selected: 95 clinical strains with different resistance patterns: 60 susceptible to beta-lactams, 25 PPNG, 10 chromosomal decreased susceptibility to beta-lactams. Among these strains, 13 had a decreased susceptibility to erythromycin (MIC: 2 and 4 mg/l) and 5 WHO reference strains: A: spectinomycin resistance, B: wild phenotype, C: chromosomal decreased susceptibility to penicillin and tetracycline, D: chromosomal resistance to penicillin and erythromycin+chromosomal decreased susceptibility to chloramphenicol, E: beta-lactamase producing strain (PPNG) and decreased susceptibility to tetracycline. MICs have been determined by GC agar dilution method. Azithromycin is more active than erythromycin on all N. gonorrhoeae patterns with a two log 10 difference for MIC50 and MIC90 (p < 0.0001). Because of pharmacokinetic properties and activity against Chlamydia trachomatis and urogenital mycoplasms often associated with N. gonorrhoeae, azithromycin is a good alternative for the treatment of genital infections.
