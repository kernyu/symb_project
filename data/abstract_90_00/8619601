To investigate emerging fluoroquinolone resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolated in Japan, we compared the in vitro antimicrobial susceptibilities of 79 gonococcal isolates from 1992 through 1993 to 14 fluoroquinolones and 14 other antibiotics with those of 27 isolates from between 1981 and 1984. The MICs at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited by nine fluroquinolones, including norfloxacin, enoxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, lomefloxacin, fleroxacin, levofloxacin, and sparfloxacin, for isolates from 1992 to 1993 were 8- or 16-fold higher than those for isolates from 1981 to 1984. Furthermore, the MICs at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited by five fluroquinolones, including OPC-17116, T-3761, DU-6859a, AM-1155, and Q-35, that have recently been synthesized but have not yet been introduced for clinical use in Japan for isolates from 1992 to 1993 were also 2- to 16-fold higher than those for isolates from 1981 to 1984. The gonococcal isolates from 1992 to 1993 showed no significant decreases in susceptibility to beta-lactams, tetracyclines, macrolides, and spectinomycin, compared with those for isolates from 1981 to 1984. Our data indicate that the incidence of gonococcal strains with decreased susceptibilities to fluoroquinolones is increasing in Japan.
