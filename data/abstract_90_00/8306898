Antibiotic resistance patterns among Salmonella and Shigella spp isolated from diarrhoeic human beings were studied. Eleven antibiotic resistance patterns were observed. Plasmid survey of the isolates revealed the presence of multiple plasmids in thirty two of the fifty three strains. More plasmid patterns than antibiotic resistance were observed. Incidence of Salmonellosis and Shigellosis in this environment is caused by genetically unrelated Salmonella and Shigella strains although with identical drug resistance patterns.
