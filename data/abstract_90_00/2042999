In order to study sensitivity or resistance of T.b. gambiense to baboon serum, two species of baboons, P. hamadryas and P. papio were inoculated with T.b. gambiense clone LiTat 1.1. Both species were receptive to infection but, parasitological and immunological parameters showed that P. papio was more trypanotolerant than P. hamadryas. The VAT-specific trypanolysis test and the ELISA, using MoAb for circulating antigen detection may be appropriate for the diagnosis of human trypanosomiasis due to T.b. gambiense.
