In Touba, more important accessibility to antimalarial drugs and their uncontrolled use let to assure that the rate of malarial morbidity would be lower there than in other place in Senegal whereas the rate of chloroquine resistance would be higher. A checking survey of these assumptions has been carried out from october 15 to november 10, 1995 in Touba's health center. Among 227 feverish subjects investigated, 111 were Plasmodium falciparum carriers. Malarial bouts accounted for 48.9% of the feverish fits observed and for the major cause of consultation during the rainy season. These figures are higher than those usually observed in urban environment. Conversely, the rate of chloroquine resistance is lower than those observed in urban zones, since the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine on Plasmodium falciparum was 100% in that survey.
