A total of 300 recent blood stream and pneumonia isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from 32 different medical centers in the United States were used to assess the accuracy of the Vitek System (GNS-107 card) for cefepime, a new "fourth-generation" cephalosporin. The Vitek System test result was compared to the consensus of the three other methods (reference broth microdilution, disk diffusion, Etest (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden)); and 271 of 300 consensus category of susceptibility sets were unanimous. The Vitek System produced a 25.3% error rate (5.3% false resistance, 20.0% minor errors). A consistent trend toward higher MIC results with the Vitek System was observed that produced a 15.3 to 21.3% lower susceptible rate compared with the other susceptibility test methods. The consensus cefepime resistance rate was only 4.3% compared to 14.0% for the Vitek GNS-107 card. The error was reproducible on triplicate repeat testing. These results indicate an unacceptable rate of false resistance being produced by the Vitek System when testing cefepime against P. aeruginosa strains. Alternative methods are suggested for this broad-spectrum antipseudomonal cephalosporin.
