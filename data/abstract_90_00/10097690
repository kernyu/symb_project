Streptococcus pneumoniae is an important pathogen causing invasive infections particularly in children. Penicillin-nonsusceptible pneumococci are very prevalent in Korea and a difficult problem in antimicrobial treatment. Immunization with effective vaccines including viral and bacterial vaccines has proven to be the most effective and reliable method to prevent the target disease. Universal immunization to infants with Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine has dramatically proven to be very effective in reducing invasive Hib diseases and also the carriage rate. The 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine is effective in preventing invasive diseases in young adults and covers most of the penicillin-nonsusceptible types. It has not proven very effective in the prevention of otitis media, and is unable to elicit adequate antibody response in children younger than 2 years of age. Recently a new polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine was developed which can elicit antibody response in children younger than 2 years of age. However, the vaccine is only 8-valent at the moment. Studies are required to determine the possible idiotypic modulation and nonproductive immune response when polysaccharide vaccine is administered to infants. Part of the problem of antimicrobial-resistant pneumococcal infection may be solved in the future with the use of improved vaccine. Preventing pneumococcal infections with safe and effective vaccines will not only reduce the development of antibiotic resistance, but could also be the most cost-effective method to control pneumococcal disease.
