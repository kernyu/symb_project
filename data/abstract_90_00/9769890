Multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MEE) and in vitro antifungal susceptibility testing were used to investigate the Candida albicans strain diversity in twenty nine AIDS patients from Abidjan (Ivory Coast). All patients were monitored for a first episode of oropharyngeal candidiasis and were randomly clustered into three groups of therapy: ketoconazole, amphotericin B or nystatin. Oral swabs were collected before every treatment, 14 and 30 days after the initiation of the therapy; a total of 67 isolates were investigated. No resistant or less susceptible isolate to any antifungal agent was found despite the emergence of clinical relapses, mainly for patients treated with nystatin or amphotericin B. The MEE analysis revealed 27 different electrophoretic types (ETs). Genetic distances between ETs were statistically analyzed and represented on a dendrogram. The 27 ETs clustered into three groups; in each group, ETs represented variants of the same strain. A segregation of the C. albicans isolates seemed to be as a function of the serotype.
