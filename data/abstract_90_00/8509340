A 12.6-kb DNA fragment from Streptomyces glaucescens GLA.0 containing the 12 genes for tetracenomycin (TCM) C biosynthesis and resistance enabled Streptomyces lividans to produce TCM C. Transcriptional analysis of the tcmPG intergenic region in this cluster established the presence of two divergent promoters. The tcmIc mutation, a T-to-G transversion in the -10 region of the tcmG promoter, decreased promoter activity drastically at the stationary growth stage and time of maximum TCM C accumulation. This promoter may direct the transcription of a tcmGHIJKLMNO operon, while the other promoter is for tcmP.
