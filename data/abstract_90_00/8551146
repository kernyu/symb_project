This study retrospectively investigated the microbiology and management of 40 children who suffered from chronic sinusitis. The sinuses infected were the maxillary (15 cases), ethmoid (13), and frontal (seven). Pansinusitis was present in five patients. All aspirates were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 121 isolates (97 anaerobic and 24 aerobic) were recovered. Anaerobes were recovered from all 37 culture-positive specimens, and in 14 cases (38 per cent) they were mixed with aerobes. Twenty-three beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 16 (43 per cent) patients. The 15 patients who received clindamycin had the most rapid response to therapy and a change of therapy and surgical drainage was required in one case. Of the 16 patients who received amoxycillin or ampicillin, 16 responded to therapy, six needed a change of therapy, including four who also had surgical drainage. Of the six who were treated with erythromycin, three needed antibiotic change, two with surgical drainage. Of the three that received cefaclor, two were cured, and one had an antibiotic change. Resistant organisms were recovered in all the cases that required therapeutic change. These findings support the important role of anaerobic bacteria in the polymicrobial cause of chronic sinusitis in children, and the superiority of therapy effective against these organisms.
