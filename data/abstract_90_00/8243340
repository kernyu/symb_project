A recently developed glass ionomer bone cement (Ionos) may be suitable for bonding vertically fractured teeth, but the resulting resistance to repeated fracture of the bonded teeth is unknown. The purpose of this study was to assess in vitro the resistance to repeated fracture of roots which were previously fractured and bonded with Ionos cement and other bonding agents. Thirty-six roots were separated at the cervix and grooved on the coronal surface. Each root was mounted in an Instron machine and a vertical force was exerted until fracture occurred. Both the force required to fracture the root (F) and the root surface area (A) were recorded, and the root halves were bonded with one of the following materials: Ionos bone cement without dentin etching, Permabond 910 cyanoacrylate adhesive, and Gluma bonding system. The bonded roots were maintained in a wet sponge. One week later the roots were re-fractured in the Instron machine, and the forces were recorded (RF). Each one of F, RF, A, and the ratios RF/F and RF/A were compared statistically among the three experimental groups. Overall, RF was at the most 20% of F. Statistically significant differences were obtained only in RF, RF/F, and RF/A (p < 0.0003). Roots bonded with Ionos cement demonstrated significantly lower values than roots bonded with Permabond and Gluma, both of which did not differ significantly. It was concluded that roots bonded with Ionos cement were the least resistant to re-fracture, due to a lesser bonding strength of Ionos bone cement as compared with Permabond and Gluma.
