Urinary tract infections belong to the most frequent infections at all. It can be seen above all in younger women for whom it may be rather burdensome especially due to recurrence. The complicated cystitis thus being a women's disease whereas there is a rare incidence in men. Effective therapy consists in almost all the cases of a short empirical treatment of three days. Further investigating being often superfluous. However, there is a higher incidence in ageing men at times to be seen in combination with prostatic hyperplasia. Apart from the simple and uncomplicated cystitis we know the recurrent simple infections as well as the complicated ones and the asymptomatic bacteriuria. Special care has to be taken of the pregnant woman's cystitis in which case our diagnosing the asymptomatic bacteriuria right at the beginning by way of urine tests proves most significant in order to avoid the risk of a pyelonephritis. Even in geronto-therapy the urinary tract infection is a very common disease. Pathogenetically important are then involutional changes along with a possible multimorbidity. In this patient group the asymptomatic bacteriuria takes its course very often without any further need for therapy. Patients under continuous catheterization presenting with urinary tract infections are very common, every permanent catheter basically causing bacteriuria. Therapeutical measures with regard to resistance are indicated as a rule only in case of symptomatic urinary tract infections.
