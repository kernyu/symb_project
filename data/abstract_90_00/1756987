We have developed a transformation system for the filamentous ascomycete fungus Ashbya gossypii. Mycelial protoplasts were transformed to geneticin-resistance with plasmids containing the Escherichia coli kanamycin-resistance gene as a selectable marker and autonomously replicating sequences (ARS) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ARS1, 2 mu ARS). Transformation frequencies of up to 63 transformants per microgram of plasmid DNA were obtained. The transformants were unstable under nonselective conditions. Southern analysis of DNA separated by conventional and pulsed-field-gel electrophoresis showed that the transforming DNA was present as autonomously replicating plasmid. Plasmid integration into chromosomal DNA was not detected. We concluded that the S. cerevisiae ARS elements are functional in A. gossypii, since vectors lacking such elements did not yield transformants.
