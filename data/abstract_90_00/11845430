A number of 150 samples were prelevated from respiratory tract secretions of 88 patients with respiratory infections and three healthy subjects; 162 haemophilus strains were isolated, identified and studied and the following results were obtained: H. parainfluenzae was isolated from tonsillitis and laryngitis--over 70%, bronchitis--58% and pharyngitis--56.6%; H. influenzae was isolated from pharyngitis--26.4%, bronchitis--16.1% and tonsillitis--13.6% cases; H. parahaemolyticus from bronchitis--19.3%, tonsillitis--13.6% and laryngitis. H. paraphrophilus was isolated (6.8%) from pharyngitis, tonsillitis, sinusitis, bronchitis and pulmonary abscess and H. paraphrohaemolyticus was isolated--4.5% from pharyngitis, synusitis, bronchitis and pulmonary sarcoidosis. Most of the isolates belonged to biotype II H. influenzae and biotypes II, I, III H. parainfluenzae. Haemophils were 100% sensitive to Ofloxacin and resistant to Cro--13.5%, Do--17.9%, C and Caz--22.2%, Aml--24.6%, Rd--40.7%, Amp--41.9% and Te--63.5%; varying according to the haemophilus species. H. influenzae was resistant to Do--14.2%, Caz and C--21.4%, H. parainfluenzae was resistant to Cro--11%, Do--22%, whilst H. parahaemolyticus was resistant to Do--9% and to Aml, Caz and Cro--13.6%. Haemophils isolated from sputum showed a resistance higher by 12-34% and 6-17% than those isolated from other specimens, such as pharyngeal exudate, where the resistance to rifadin was lower by 10%. beta-lactamases were present in 27.7% of the strains: H. parainfluenzae--36%, H. paraphrohaemolyticus--25%, H. influenzae--17.8% and H. parahaemolyticus--15.7%; in strains from sputum--34.2%, pharyngeal exudate--28.8% and from other specimens--6.6%. No correlations were noticed between the biotype and the clinical manifestation or the resistance to the antibiotic, a higher frequency of beta-lactamase production being reported in H. influenzae biotype V and H. parainfluenzae biotypes II and IV.
