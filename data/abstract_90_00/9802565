Eight human cases of melioidosis were diagnosed at Hainan People's Hospital over a period of one year. Four of the cases were of septicemia form, while the rest were of chronic form with abscesses in different organs. All the isolates were intrinsically resistant to cefazolin, cefuroxime, and gentamicin, while being rather sensitive to ampicillin/sulbactam, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, and imipenem. A serological survey of exotoxin antibodies at different farms showed that Xinglong was a farm seriously devastated by Burkholderia pseudomallei, while the mountainous farm of Licai had the lowest prevalence (P< 0.01). From the results of serological survey and melioidosis case distribution, it could be clearly seen that melioidosis predominantly exists in coastal plain regions around this island, where the altitude above sea-level is below 100 m, the annual rainfall is up to 2,300 mm and a rather warm climate in coldest months of December and January.
