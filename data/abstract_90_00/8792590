Five sheep farms located in different geo-climatic regions were surveyed for resistance in gastrointestinal nematodes to albendazole, levamisole and ivermectin. Resistance to albendazole and levamisole was evident on all the farms. Albendazole reduced faecal egg counts by 0-73% and levamisole by 0-61%. No eggs were detected after treatment with ivermectin.
