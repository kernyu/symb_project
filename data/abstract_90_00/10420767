RFLP analysis using a IS6110 probe was used to genetically marked polyresistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains isolated from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis in the north-west of Russia in 1996-1997. Two groups of genetically closely related, but epidemiologically unrelated strains of different territorial origin were identified. The epidemiological value of and the origin of genetically identified and related strains are discussed. The significance and prospects of the use of RFLP-based genome dactyloscopy are shown for follow-ups of the circulation of epidemic strains in order to improve the system of tuberculosis epidemiological surveillance and treatment efficiency control.
