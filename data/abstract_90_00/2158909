Funiculosin is a well-known inhibitor of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, probably acting at the ubiquinone reducing site or center i of QH2-cytochrome c reductase. We report here the isolation, mapping and RNA sequence analysis of yeast apo-cytochrome b mutants resistant to this inhibitor. Funiculosin-resistance was found to be conferred, in 4 independent isolates, upon replacement of a leucine residue by phenylalanine in position 198 of the cytochrome b polypeptide chain.
