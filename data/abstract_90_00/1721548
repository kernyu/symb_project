The effectiveness of interferon (IFN) action depends not only on the type of IFN but also on the sensitivity of target cells to IFN. Revealing the reasons of different sensitivity of cells to IFN is of significant importance for understanding the mechanisms of cell reaction regulation. The review presents the principle historical stages of study of cell resistance to IFN, some aspects of cell insusceptibility to antiviral and antiproliferative action of various types of IFN are considered. Types of cell resistance to specific IFN effects have been determined. The mechanisms of development of cell resistance and possibilities in correction of cell insusceptibility to IFN are discussed.
