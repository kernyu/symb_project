The aim of the present study was to evaluate the acute effect of ethanol on insulin sensitivity, and glucose, insulin, free fatty acid (FFA), and triacylglycerol responses in ten patients with non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes. In the test study an oral dose of 0.66 g ethanol/kg followed by continuous intravenous infusion of 0.1 g ethanol/kg per h was given to maintain a constant ethanol level in the blood. In the control study identical volumes of oral water and intravenous saline (9 g NaCl/l) were given. After 90 min insulin sensitivity was determined by the hyperinsulinaemic, euglycaemic clamp technique. Ethanol caused no change in blood glucose or insulin concentrations. The FFA level was suppressed by ethanol while the triacylglycerol level was unaffected. The insulin sensitivity was not affected by ethanol. No major acute effect of ethanol on the glycaemic control in fasting type 2 diabetic patients was found in comparison with what is seen in healthy people. The present study, along with the sparse literature, indicates that the ability of ethanol to induce hypoglycaemia is attenuated or absent in diet-treated type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, we found no change in insulin sensitivity. Consequently, the risk of acute ethanol-induced aberrations in carbohydrate metabolism in diet-treated type 2 diabetes seems to be less than previously expected, when alcohol is not taken as a part of a meal.
