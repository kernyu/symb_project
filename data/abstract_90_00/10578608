An improved knowledge of HIV disease pathogenesis, the availability of viral load determination and the increasing numbers of available agents have led to major advances in the field of antiretroviral therapy. Antiviral therapy has to be potent while allowing patient adherence to complex regimens and minimizing long-term toxicity. Beyond highly active antiretroviral therapy combining two nucleosides and a protease inhibitor, other triple-drug combinations have been validated or are under study. Therapeutic strategy in case of virological failure depends on the choice of the initial combination option, due to the cross-resistance between drugs from the same class. Viral sensitivity testing on one hand, and adjunctive immunotherapy on the other hand, are two interesting perspectives that may improve the management of HIV-infected patients.
