BACKGROUND: In this report based on data from the Institutional Surveillance System during 1994-1998, we document the continuing emergence of drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains at the Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez in Mexico City. METHODS: We evaluate the clinical course of 49 invasive pneumococcal infection outside the central nervous system (CNS) by a number of factors including the site, severity, and place where the infection was acquired, the underlying health of the patient, and the adequacy of antimicrobial therapy. RESULTS: An underlying illness was present in 21 of 49 (43%) patients, 37 (75%) patients had taken previous antimicrobial therapy, and 25% of the infections were nosocomially acquired. Overall, 25 of 49 (51%) of the pneumococcal strains tested were pencillin-resistant; strains with the highest resistance to penicillin were also resistant to cephalosporins. Twenty-two percent of all strains were considered to be multidrug-resistant. Eleven of 25 penicillin-resistant strains were identified as multidrug-resistant, i.e., to erythromycin, TMP/SMX, and chloramphenicol. Ten serotypes accounted for 88% of the isolates, the most frequent serotypes being 23F, 14, 19V, 6A, and 6B. The overall case-fatality rate was 37% (18 of 49), with most deaths occurring within 3-5 days after antibiotic therapy was initiated. There was no difference in the case fatality rate between children with penicillin-nonsusceptible and penicillin-susceptible pneumococcal infections; instead; case-fatality rate correlated with severity of illness on admission and presence of underlying disease. CONCLUSIONS: Characterizing groups at risk for invasive pneumococcal disease could aid in the development of preventive programs and increase the benefits from wide use of future conjugated vaccines.
