Blood schizontocidal activity of quinine and quinidine has been compared against sensitive as well as chloroquine/mefloquine/quinine resistant strains of Plasmodium berghei and a multiple resistant strain of P. yoelii nigeriensis in Swiss mice. Evaluation of results on ED50/ED90 basis has shown distinct superiority of quinidine over quinine against sensitive as well as drug resistant strain of rodent malaria.
