The adherence of fluconazole-resistant and fluconazole-susceptible isolates of Candida albicans to explanted rabbit esophageal mucosa was examined in vivo. Among six Candida albicans isolates collected from HIV-infected patients, three fluconazole-resistant (MIC > 64 microg/ml) isolates attached more avidly than three fluconazole-susceptible strains (MIC < or = 0.5 microg/ml) to esophageal mucosa (P < or = 0.05). When three strains each of six different Candida spp. were compared, the more inherently fluconazole-resistant isolates adhered more avidly in the following order: Candida glabrata>Candida krusei>Candida albicans fluconazole-sensitive>Candida tropicalis>Candida parapsilosis. Nonetheless, fluconazole-resistant Candida albicans demonstrated the greatest degree of adherence in comparison to all fluconazole-susceptible Candida albicans (P<0.001) and to all Candida spp. tested (P<0.001). Thus, the refractoriness of esophageal candidiasis in patients infected with fluconazole-resistant isolates may be related to both in vitro drug resistance and increased mucosal adherence.
