Plasmids containing the origin of replication, oriP, of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and EBV nuclear antigen-1 genes replicate extrachromosomally in primate cells. However, these plasmids have been believed not to replicate in rodent cells. We demonstrate here that these plasmids can replicate in some types of rodent cells over a long period. This result should offer not only the new insight into the mechanisms of species-specific replication of EBV, but also the possibility that an EBV-based vector can be used for gene transfer experiments in non-primate cells and an animal experiment regarding human gene therapy.
