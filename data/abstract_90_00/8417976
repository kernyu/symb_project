It was shown that 15-min electrical stimulation of the rat sciatic nerve greatly increases the in vitro measured sensitivity of lactate formation, glucose transport, and glycogen synthesis to insulin, impaired by previous tenotomy. The insulin sensitivity of all these processes was, however, still below that found in the stimulated intact soleus muscle. Extending the stimulation up to 30 min did not cause any further changes in insulin sensitivity either in tenotomized or in intact muscles.
