We have increased the production of bovine chymosin in Aspergillus niger var. awamori to more than one gram per liter of secreted authentic enzyme by combining a mutagenesis protocol with a novel robotic screening program. Analysis of the superior chymosin producing strains indicated that they have enhanced capabilities to secrete extracellular proteins.
