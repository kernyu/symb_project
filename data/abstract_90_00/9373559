Four cases of serious MRSA wound infection following head and neck surgery have been identified. One patient died. At post mortem a mediastinal abscess containing MRSA was found to have eroded into the innominate artery causing fatal haemorrhage. The other three suffered serious wound infections, two requiring further surgery. Once MRSA had been identified they were treated with intravenous teicoplanin and all made a full recovery.
