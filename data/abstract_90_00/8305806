A great many reports have been published about the multiresistance to strains of antibiotics in countries with a high incidence of shigellosis. In order to obtain better information about the situation in Germany, we tested 255 Shigella strains to 28 antibiotics during the 1989-1990 period. 153 (60%) of isolates originated from imported cases of infection (Middle and Far East, West and North Africa, Central America), whereas no history of infection in foreign countries was available for the remaining 102 strains. 207 (81.2%) of these strains were resistant to one or more antibiotics. They were divided into 6 phaenotypes according to their resistant pattern. The phaenotypes with the resistance patterns AMP, CMP, SM, SSS, TET as well as SM, SSS, TET in combination with SXT (38.6%) were most frequently isolated, followed by phaenotypes with the resistance pattern AMP, CMP, SM, SSS, or SM, SSS, combined with or without SXT (27.5%), and the phaenotypes AMP, CMP, SM, TET and CMP, SM, SSS, TET (15%). The incidence of resistance was significantly higher in strains from imported cases (93.5%) than in isolates from domestic infections (62.7%; p < 0.001). The similarity of the resistance patterns of strains acquired abroad and those acquired in Germany suggested that such strains might have been introduced from abroad. All strains were sensitive to the quinolones examined (ofloxacin and enoxacin) as well as to cephalosporines of the second and third generations.
