OBJECTIVE: New antiretroviral strategies aim to reduce plasma HIV RNA (viral load) to below the limits of detectability of assays with the objective of reducing viral replication in order to stop or reverse the pathogenic process and prevent development of drug resistance. First use of a protease inhibitor might offer the most realistic chance of achieving this aim. Our objective was to study the virological response to protease inhibitors in patients taking them for the first time. METHODS: A total of 901 patients from a large outpatient clinic were followed a mean of 15 months from the time of starting a protease inhibitor until 1 May 1998. Viral load and CD4 cell count measurements were made on average every 34 days. RESULTS: Overall there was a 79% [95% confidence interval (CI), 76-82] probability of the patients achieving a viral load < 500 copies/ml by 24 weeks after starting the protease inhibitor. In a multiple Cox regression model, those with lower initial viral load [relative hazard (RH), 0.72; P < 0.0001], higher CD4 cell count (RH, 1.07; P = 0.002), those starting other new drugs at same time as the protease inhibitor (RH, 1.46 for two versus none; P = 0.003), those who were antiretroviral-naive, and those using indinavir or nelfinavir were more likely to achieve such levels. In those 651 patients achieving viral load < 500 copies/ml within 24 weeks, there was an estimated 53% (95% CI, 51-55) probability of rebound of viral load to > 500 copies/ml by 52 weeks from the first undetectable value. Again, those who had started other new drugs at the same time as the protease inhibitor (RH, 0.57; P = 0.003 for starting two versus none) tended to experience a lower probability of viral load rebound, as did those with higher initial CD4 cell count (RH, 0.87 per 100 x 10(6)/l higher; P = 0.0007). Those who took saquinavir achieved less durable virological responses than those who took other protease inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Starting protease inhibitor therapy with two other new antiretroviral drugs simultaneously with protease inhibitor therapy offers a better best chance of achieving sustained viral load < 500 copies/ml than starting fewer new drugs.
