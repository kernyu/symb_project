The effect of the type of sugar used as substrate on the susceptibility of Streptococcus mutans to antibiotics was evaluated. Thirty strains, grown in excess of sucrose (s-MIC) and in excess of glucose (g-MIC), were tested for susceptibility to four cephalosporins. About 21% of the strains were sensitive in the presence of sucrose and resistant in the presence of glucose, whereas only 3% of the strains showed the opposite situation. The mean values of the s-MICs of the four cephalosporins were significantly lower than those of the g-MICs. These findings may also be explained by the synthesis, in excess of sucrose, of insoluble glucan by Streptococcus mutans which increases the interbacterial distance and promotes antibiotic diffusion. Given the susceptibility of Streptococcus mutans grown in excess of sucrose to cefotaxime and cefepime, these antibiotics may be used in the primary prevention of infective endocarditis, when subjects predisposed to endocarditis need invasive dental therapy.
