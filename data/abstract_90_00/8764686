To develop a system for gene replacement in Nocardia corallina, a protocol for electroporation was optimized by systematic alterations of growth conditions, field strength, time constant and the electroporation buffer. Transformation efficiencies of 0.5 x 10(6) - 3 x 10(6) transformants/microgram plasmid DNA were obtained routinely. The gene encoding the polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase I of N. corallina was cloned and interrupted by insertion of a kanamycin-resistance gene. The resulting plasmid was introduced into N. corallina by electroporation to inactivate the wild-type gene by homologous recombination. Kanamycin-resistant clones were screened by Southern hybridization for the absence of the wild-type gene and analyzed for PHA accumulation.
