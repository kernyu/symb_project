Rhizoxin is a new macrocyclic lactone isolated from the fungus Rhizopus chinensis. In an attempt to predict the effectiveness of rhizoxin in the treatment of lung cancer, we compared the antitumor activity of rhizoxin with those of cisplatin and etoposide using four small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines, SBC-2, -3, -4, and -7, and two non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, ABC-1 and EBC-1. The concentrations producing 50% inhibition of the growth of these cell lines (IC50) for each drug were obtained by MTT assay. The IC50 of rhizoxin for these cell lines ranged 0.408 nM to 1.56 nM, which were significant lower than those of cisplatin (660 nM to 16,300 nM) and etoposide (275 nM to 31,300 nM). The ratio of IC50 for the most sensitive cell line, SBC-3, to that for the most resistant cell line was less than 4-fold in rhizoxin, in contrast to more than 20-fold in cisplatin and 100-fold in etoposide. Cross-resistance of rhizoxin to cisplatin and etoposide was investigated using a cisplatin-resistant SCLC subline, SBC-3/CDDP, and an etoposide-resistant SCLC subline, SBC-3/ETP. Of interest, the parent cell line, and the resistant sublines were equally sensitive to rhizoxin, indicating rhizoxin being non-cross-resistant to cisplatin and etoposide. In conclusion, rhizoxin may be beneficial in the salvage chemotherapy of drug-resistant SCLC and non-SCLC.
