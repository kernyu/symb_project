Leucocin A is a class IIa bacteriocin produced by Leuconostoc spp. that has previously been shown to inhibit the growth of Listeria monocytogenes. A spontaneous resistant mutant of L. monocytogenes was isolated and found to be resistant to leucocin A at levels in excess of 2 mg/ml. The mutant showed no significant cross-resistance to nontype IIa bacteriocins including nisaplin and ESF1-7GR. However, there were no inhibition zones found on a lawn of the mutant when challenged with an extract containing 51,200 AU of pediocin PA-2 per ml as determined by a simultaneous assay on the sensitive wild-type strain. DNA and protein analysis of the resistant and susceptible strains were carried out using silver-stained amplified fragment length polymorphism (ssAFLP) and one- and two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), respectively. Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE clearly showed a 35-kDa protein which was present in the sensitive but absent from the resistant strain. The N-terminal end of the 35-kDa protein was sequenced and found to have an 83% homology to the mannose-specific phosphotransferase system enzyme IIAB of Streptococcus salivarius.
