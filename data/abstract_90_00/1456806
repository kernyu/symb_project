The results of the experimental study on the effect of the natural and recombinant gamma-interferons (gamma-IFs) of mice on the process of the infection caused by Klebsiella sp. are presented. The infection was reproduced by intraperitoneal contamination of mice with a virulent culture of Klebsiella pneumoniae 5055, line SHK. The gamma-IFs were administered to the animals in a dose of 250 units per mouse on days 1 and 3 after the contamination. Survival of the animals, clearance of the pathogen from the blood and liver and functional activity of the phagocytes in the contaminated mice were investigated. It was shown that both the natural and recombinant gamma-IF stimulated the phagocytic activity and oxidative metabolism of the phagocytes in the contaminated mice. Activation of these functions after the use of the natural gamma-IF correlated with its marked protective effect and accelerated elimination of the pathogen from the host which was not observed after the use of the recombinant gamma-IF.
