Strains of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have emerged and spread widely throughout the United States during the last few years. Multiply-resistant strains of Enterococcus faecium are especially troublesome because they are often resistant to all commercially available antimicrobial agents. At present, VRE infections occur most often in hospitalized patients with severe underlying disease who have undergone invasive procedures and received prolonged courses of broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy. Because therapeutic options are limited, prevention of spread from patients with known cases to other vulnerable patients is essential.
