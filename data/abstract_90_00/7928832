Twenty-four general practitioners completed a questionnaire on behalf of their partners in the practices before attending the symposium. The main points that emerged were that trimethoprim was the most popular antibiotic for treatment of acute urinary infection and that the most common duration of treatment was 5 to 7 days. A panel discussion, with audience participation, covered duration of treatment, antibiotic resistance, specimen collection, management of different patient groups and availability of information concerning resistance patterns. Nineteen of the original 24 general practitioners returned the post-meeting questionnaire, and stated that, as a result of what they had heard at the symposium, they were contemplating changing the way in which they managed urinary infections. Information concerning bacteriuria in pregnancy and changing patterns of bacterial resistance to antibiotics were of particular interest.
