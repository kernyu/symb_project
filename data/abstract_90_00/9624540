The in vitro antibacterial activity of BAY 12-8039, a novel 8-methoxy-quinolone, was compared with those of other quinolones, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefuroxime and erythromycin against species commonly implicated in respiratory tract infections as well as viridans group streptococci. The new compound was highly active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC90 0.125 microgram/ml), penicillin-susceptible and penicillin-resistant pneumococci (MIC90 0.5 and MIC50 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively), penicillin-susceptible and penicillin-resistant viridans group streptococci (MIC90 0.5 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively), group A streptococci (MIC90 0.25 microgram/ml), M. catarrhalis (MIC90 0.125 microgram/ml) and H. influenzae (MIC90 0.063 microgram/ml), irrespective of beta-lactamase production. It was, however, less active against methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MIC50 and MIC90, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively). The new compound demonstrated bactericidal activity at concentrations 2, 4, 8 times the MIC against representative isolates of the above collection. At a concentration of eight times the MIC, the frequency of spontaneous resistance ranged from 2.5 x 10(-7) to < 4 x 10(-8). These results suggested that BAY 12-8039 would be a promising agent for the eradication of respiratory tract pathogens and that clinical trials assessing its efficacy for the management of infections caused by these organisms are warranted.
