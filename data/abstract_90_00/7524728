A genomic (prb1) and two cDNA clones (PRb1-2 and PRb1-3) corresponding to two new barley basic PR-1 proteins (prb1-2 and prb1-3) were isolated from Hordeum vulgare. Genomic analysis of DNA suggests that the barley genome contains at least 6 members corresponding to the gene family encoding PR-1 proteins. Expression of these genes was induced in primary leaf tissues of the H. vulgare cv. Psaknon 4* (F14) Man. carrying Mlp resistance gene (cv. Mlp) and the near-isogenic susceptible cultivar (cv. mlp) after inoculation with Erysiphe graminis f. sp. hordei.
