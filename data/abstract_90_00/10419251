Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have emerged as important nosocomial pathogens since 1988. We report here an outbreak of VRE between April 1997 and May 1997 in our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). All isolates from four patients were identified as Enterococcus faecium positive and were resistant to vancomycin and teicoplanin. All of the patients with VRE were isolated for at least 5 d after admission to the unit and the positive cultures lasted between 13 and 31 d. There were no cases of sepsis or mortality in the patients with VRE. Two cases had previously received vancomycin therapy. All isolates were shown to have the vanA gene and had the same band pattern on repetitive PCR. After the four episodes, all equipment used to care for the patients were decontaminated and the staff engaged in therapy used disposable gloves and gowns. There were no more episodes. However, the NICU is no longer a safety area with regards to vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infection.
