The study was intended to develop a simple and reliable in vivo field test for monitoring of sensitivity of P.falciparum to antimalarials. The test is to be used as a built in sustainable monitoring system and applied at regular frequencies to provide guidance in developing a country-wide antimalarial drug policy. The study was conducted as a hospital based study in Mon State in Mudon, Kamawet and Pa-auk hospitals. The criteria matched malaria patients were treated with standard dosages of chloroquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and mefloquine and blood films were taken on days 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 14 and 28. The assessment of the in vivo drug response of P.falciparum on days 2, 3 and 4 were compared with WHO standard 28 days and 7 day tests. The following successful tests were carried out for 7 days with different antimalarials: 171 tests with chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and 167 tests with mefloquine. Tests were also carried out for 28 days: 59 tests with chloroquine, 77 tests with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and 78 tests with mefloquine. The results found that 3 day tests, taking blood films on days 0 and 3, can be reliably used as an adjunct to 28-day tests. Since the test is simple and can be used extensively and sustainably throughout the country and the results are applicable to be used for epidemiological purposes, the method is suggested for use as a built-in monitoring method for the malaria control program.
