The genome of Herpesvirus saimiri, a lymphotropic virus of non-human primates, was used to develop a vector system for transducing foreign genes into primary human T-cells and T-lymphoid cell lines. Recombinant viruses were obtained by homologous recombination of the viral genome with linearized plasmid DNA. The plasmid used contained a fragment of virion DNA, a hygromycin-B-resistance marker (HyR), and a multiple cloning site for the insertion of additional expression cassettes. The resulting recombinants were efficiently enriched and were plaque-purified. The virus mediating HyR and a H. saimiri strain carrying the Geneticin-resistance marker were used to infect the human T-lymphoid cell line Jurkat. Lymphocytes with a double-resistant phenotype were shown to contain the two different H. saimiri recombinants persisting as episomes at high multiplicity. The H. saimiri vector system will be suitable to study cooperating regulatory genes in T-lymphocytes.
