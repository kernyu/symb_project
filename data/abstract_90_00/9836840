BACKGROUND: Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are important nosocomial pathogens in many hospitals. The true prevalence of VRE in pediatric hospitals is not known. METHODS: A surveillance study was performed at a pediatric tertiary care medical center by using vancomycin-containing screening media. RESULTS: Six children (of 112 screened) were found to be colonized with VRE. Colonized patients had a history of receiving broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. CONCLUSION: In the absence of VRE infections, surveillance studies can help determine the extent of VRE colonization and support infection control measures.
