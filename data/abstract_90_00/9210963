The ex vivo antimalarial activity of plasma samples obtained from 20 healthy Caucasian volunteers following daily proguanil (200 mg) plus dapsone (8 mg) for malaria chemoprophylaxis inhibited five cycloguanil-resistant Thai isolates of Plasmodium falciparum. All volunteers were phenotyped as extensive metabolisers (EMs) of proguanil. Three of the five isolates were obtained from Thai soldiers who had failed malaria prophylaxis on daily proguanil (200 mg) plus dapsone (4.0 or 12.5 mg). The Thai soldiers were also classified as EMs, but had relatively lower plasma cycloguanil concentrations compared to values reported in the literature for Caucasians and black Kenyans. Although the high level of parasite resistance to cycloguanil was the most likely explanation for the Thai soldiers failing prophylaxis on proguanil plus dapsone, their low cycloguanil concentrations may have also contributed to their lack of protection. However, in areas where parasites are more susceptible to cycloguanil, such as in certain regions of Africa, proguanil plus dapsone may still be an effective chemoprophylactic drug combination.
