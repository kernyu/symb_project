A number of integrational vectors were developed for use as genetic tools in the food-borne pathogen Campylobacter coli. Integration of the plasmids occurred following genetic recombination via a Campbell-like mechanism. For an integrative plasmid containing a DNA fragment internal to the C. coli catalase gene, the insertion was mutagenic and led to a catalase-deficient phenotype. A procedure for generating random mutations in the C. coli chromosome, with these suicide-plasmids, was developed. In addition, the construction and utility of an integrable plasmid for generating transcriptional fusions to a cat reporter gene is described.
