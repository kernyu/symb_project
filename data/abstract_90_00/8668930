Four human cytomegalovirus strains with double resistance to both ganciclovir and foscarnet were recovered from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. The four isolates were genetically unrelated and each of them consisted of a single viral population. In addition, for each isolate, UL97 and UL54 open reading frames sequencing showed a single aminoacid change in a conserved domain of each of the two genes.
