Alive cultures of Bacillus subtilis, antagonists of pyogenic microflora, have been studied for their effect on functional activity of macrophagal cells and induction of endogenic serum alpha-interferon in the female mice of the SBA line. It is established that even a single intravaginal and intraperitoneal introduction of bacilli in a dose of 1 milliard cells in 0.1 ml of cultural fluid stimulates migration, absorption and especially bactericidal activity of macrophages of peritoneal exudate. Introduction of alive cultures of aerobic bacilli essentially stimulates the in vivo production of the serum and alpha-interferon induced in vitro by the Newcastle disease virus. The highest immune-stimulating effect under a single introduction of B. subtilis is achieved 66 h later and has a tendency to gradual decrease.
