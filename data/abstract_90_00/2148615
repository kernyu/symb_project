Malaria prevention involves vector control, individual protection against mosquito bites and chemoprophylaxis. Chemoprophylaxis has become more difficult in recent years owing to the spread of chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum strains. Current possibilities are chloroquine and mefloquine (with relatively poor tolerance and a few resistant strains), or the chloroquine-proguanil combination (well tolerated with some failures). Prophylaxis should not be discontinued unless transmission remains at a low level. Among inhabitants of endemic areas, prophylaxis is generally restricted to pregnant women.
