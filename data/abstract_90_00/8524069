Fresh and salt water samples analyzed in Rio de Janeiro city showed the presence of Plesiomonas shigelloides. Forty-six strains were isolated from both environments. A high incidence of P. shigelloides was achieved in polluted fresh and salt waters as well as in samples from non-polluted streams. P. shigelloides isolates had biochemical characteristics similar to those already described in the literature. None of the isolates analyzed produced enterotoxin in the suckling mouse assay. Hemolytic activity against sheep and human type A erythrocytes was detected in the strains tested. The results of the antibiotic susceptibility tests indicated that all the isolates were susceptible to the cephalosporins, penicillins combined with a beta-lactamase inhibitor, aminoglycosides, imipenem, norfloxacin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. All the isolates were resistant to the penicillins.
