PURPOSE: To characterize cidofovir (S)-1-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl) cytosine) transport in the pigmented rabbit conjunctiva and to evaluate the formulation influence on its transport. METHODS: The excised pigmented rabbit conjunctiva was mounted in the modified Ussing chamber. Cidofovir transport was initiated by applying 3H-cidofovir to the donor compartment and assayed by measuring the radioactivity accumulated in the receiver fluid over 180 min. RESULTS: Cidofovir flux in the mucosal-to-serosal direction increased proportionally with drug concentration over the 0.01 to 1 mM range. Cidofovir transport (0.01 mM) at 37 degrees C in the mucosal-to-serosal direction was not significantly different from that in the opposite direction or from that at 4 degrees C. Hypotonicity (80 mOsm/kg), 0.5% EDTA, and 0.0125% benzalkonium chloride increased the apparent permeability coefficient of cidofovir 3, 21, and 49 times, respectively. This was accompanied by a corresponding 43%, 86%, and 96% reduction in the transconjunctival electrical resistance over 180 min. The reduction in transepithelial electrical resistance elicited by hypotonicity was reversible. There was a good correlation between apparent permeability coefficient and the transconjunctival conductance, suggesting that cidofovir may undergo paracellular passive diffusion in the conjunctiva. CONCLUSION: Cidofovir transport in the rabbit conjunctiva may be via paracellular passive diffusion. Formulation changes may improve cidofovir absorption from the conjunctival route.
