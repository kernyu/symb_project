A survey was conducted on the occurrence of anthelmintic resistance of trichostrongylids on commercial sheep farms in the highveld of Zimbabwe. On ten farms the efficacy of fenbendazole, levamisole and rafoxanide was tested by a faecal egg count reduction test. Benzimidazole resistance was additionally examined using an egg hatch assay with thiabendazole. Results of the faecal egg count reduction tests and larval differentiations showed fenbendazole resistance of Haemonchus sp. on all investigated farms. Resistance of Haemonchus sp. against rafoxanide was demonstrated on all farms with reliable egg counts. Levamisole resistance of Haemonchus sp. was found on most farms but 2 farms showed an efficacy of 100%.
