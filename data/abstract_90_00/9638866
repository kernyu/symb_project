Nine isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) collected in a Warsaw hospital in 1996 were typed by phenotypic (resistograms) and genotypic (PFGE and plasmid restriction analysis-REAP) methods. Twenty-four (MRSA) strains collected in this hospital during a period of the same duration in 1992 and typed earlier using resistograms and PFGE were also typed by REAP. Comparison of typing results obtained for isolates from 1992 and 1996 showed that strains characterised by PFGE patterns of two distinct types described as specific of the two clonally related groups of Polish MRSA in a multicentre study in 1992 are continuously present in the hospital. However, MRSA strains representing PFGE patterns not observed before were also found within the collection from 1996. REAP typing has proved to have a discriminatory power similar to that of PFGE analysis. Nevertheless, due to the lack of plasmids or difficulties in plasmid DNA isolation in 3 out of 33 studied strains, the typability of REAP turned out to be lower than that of PFGE.
