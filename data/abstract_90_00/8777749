Some mechanisms of biologic action of gamma-interferon (INF) agents have been studied in mice systems in vivo. The obtained results testify to the possibility of existence of inductor mechanisms for activation of the effector cells of immunobiologic surveillance. It is supposed that gamma-INF is a binding chain of the natural host resistance.
