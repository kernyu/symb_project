BACKGROUND: Cyclosporin has been demonstrated to reverse resistance to several antineoplastic agents including cisplatin in vitro. The purpose of this Phase I trial was to study the potential clinical application of cyclosporin modulation of cisplatin and to establish a tolerable dose of cyclosporin when combined with a standard dose of cisplatin of 75 mg/m2. METHODS: A course of therapy consisted of two cyclosporin infusions over 2 hours each, 24 hours apart, with cisplatin given 6 hours after the first dose. Treatment was repeated every 21 days. Cyclosporin was studied in a Phase I fashion at five different levels, from 1-5 mg/kg per dose. Twenty patients with refractory gynecologic cancer received 81 courses of therapy. All patients had received extensive prior chemotherapy containing cisplatin. RESULTS: Grade 4 nephrotoxicity was seen in 4 of 20 patients: 1 treated at 1 mg/kg, 1 at 2 mg/kg, and 2 at 5 mg/kg of cyclosporin. The patient treated at the 1 mg/kg level was a partial clinical responder and tolerated six courses. The patient at the 2 mg/kg level had received 14 prior courses of cisplatin and tolerated only two additional courses before a Grade 4 renal toxicity developed. Grade 4 nephrotoxicity developed in the two patients receiving 5 mg after two courses of chemotherapy. Two of the 20 patients achieved a complete response (CR) and 3 patients achieved a partial response (PR), for a total response rate of 25% (5 of 20). The two women who achieved CR started treatment with symptomatic ascites; one of whom also had multiple pulmonary lesions that were no longer evident after three courses of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Cyclosporin at a dose of 4 mg/kg per day given for 2 consecutive days in association with 75 mg/m2 of cisplatin can be given with reasonable assurance of safety.
