Plasmids mediating high-level resistance to mupirocin (MIC greater than 1000 mg/L) in staphylococci from various sources were studied by restriction endonuclease cleavage. Several patterns were obtained but six plasmids isolated from various Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis strains were indistinguishable. The diversity and spread of these plasmids is illustrated.
