Recombinant rodent gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) inhibited the infection of cultured BALB/3T3 mouse fibroblasts by Rickettsia tsutsugamushi Gilliam, apparently mainly by clearance of intracellular rickettsiae. No significant effect on rickettsial entry into the cells was noted; IFN-gamma was toxic to infected cells, as measured by the capacity of treated, infected cells to attach to the surfaces of culture vessels. In a small proportion of IFN-gamma-treated cells, rickettsial replication appeared to persist at normal levels. A fraction (28%) of rickettsiae clonally isolated from cultures treated with IFN-gamma was resistant to IFN-gamma-mediated inhibition, but four serial passages of these resistant clones in the absence of additional IFN-gamma resulted in the loss of resistance. In several respects, therefore, the IFN-gamma-mediated inhibition of scrub typhus rickettsiae in cultured fibroblasts was similar to that reported for Rickettsia prowazekii.
