OBJECTIVE: To investigate the resistance of clinical bacterial isolates as a reference for rational use of antibiotics. METHODS: Using Kirby-Bauer method for bacterial susceptibility testing and NCCLS 1997 as assessment criteria. RESULTS: The number of Gram positive organisms was increasing in clinical isolates. Among the Staphylococci aureus (SA) and coagulase negative Staphylococci (CNS), methicillin resistant SA (MRSA) and methicillin resistant CNS (MRCNS) accounted for 70.7% and 54.9% respectively, but no vancomycin resistant strain was found. Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci was about 5%. Resistant rates of Klebsiella spp, Serratia spp, Enterobacter spp and Acinetobacter spp against third generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones increased markedly. The resistant rates of most Enterobacteriaceae species against imipenem were increasing gradually, while the resistant rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa against ceftazidime, cefoperazone and imipenem were significantly higher as compared with the data in 1994. CONCLUSION: The urgent need of restricting the misuse of antibiotics.
