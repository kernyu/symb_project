The role of genetic markers such as dermatoglyphics, sex and INH inactivation in predicting the efficiency of tuberculosis chemoprophylaxis has been studied in 76 children (41 boys and 35 girls) with a tuberculin reaction reversal. The dermatoglyphic signs and the type of INH inactivation were found to be related to the efficiency of chemoprophylaxis. This makes it possible to use the child's phenotype for prognosis and better individual approach to tuberculosis chemoprophylaxis. An association has been found between the INH inactivation type and dermatoglyphics.
