Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains resistant to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) may easily be selected for in vitro and in vivo under a suboptimal therapy regimen. Although cross-resistance is extensive within this class of compounds, newer NNRTIs were reported to retain activity against laboratory strains containing defined resistance-associated mutations. We have characterized HIV-1 resistance to loviride and the extent of cross-resistance to nevirapine, delavirdine, efavirenz, HBY-097, and tivirapine in a set of 24 clinical samples from patients treated with long-term loviride monotherapy by using a recombinant virus assay. Genotypic changes associated with resistance were analyzed by population sequencing. Overall, phenotypic resistance to loviride ranged from 0.04 to 3.47 log10-fold. Resistance was observed in samples from patients who had discontinued loviride for up to 27 months. Cross-resistance to the other compounds was extensive; however, fold resistance to efavirenz was significantly lower than fold resistance to nevirapine. No genotypic changes were detected in three samples; these were sensitive to all of the NNRTIs tested. The most common genotypic change was the K103N substitution. The range of phenotypic resistance in samples containing the K103N substitution could not be predicted from a genotypic analysis of known NNRTI resistance-associated mutations. The Y181C substitution was detected in one isolate which was resistant to loviride and delavirdine but sensitive to efavirenz, HBY-097, and tivirapine. Our data indicate that the available newer NNRTIs which retain activity against some HIV-1 strains selected by other compounds of this class in vitro may have compromised clinical efficacy in some patients pretreated with NNRTI.
