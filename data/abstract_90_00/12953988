In a study of 188 cases of wound infection seen in the University College Hospital, Ibadan, between December 1994 and April 1995, 78 strains of Staphylococcus aureus were methicilin resistant (MRSA). The disc sensitivity pattern of the MRSA was determined using the method of Kirby et al., and the MICs of common antibacterial agents to the MRSA were determined by agar dilution method. Vancomycin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin offered the best effective treatment for MRSA wound infections, and are recommended as reserved drugs while gentamicin and cotrimoxazole are first line drugs.
