Antibacterial activity of 32 chemotherapeutics against 15 strains of Yersinia ++pseudotuberculosis was studied in vitro. The majority of the strains or 80% were sensitive to penicillins, cephalosporins, monobactams, aminoglycosides, tetracyclins , anzamycins, fluorine derivatives of quinolonecarboxylic acid, levomycetin and a combination of trimethoprim and ++sulfamethoxazole. It was shown that with respect to the Y. pseudotuberculosis strains with multiple antibiotic resistance, the fluorine derivatives of quinolonecarboxylic acid (ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and enoxacin), tetracyclines, netilmicin, amikacin, cefotaxime and cefazolin were promising for in vivo studies.
