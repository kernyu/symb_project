This study was conducted to examine the effect of gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma) on experimental metastasis formation by murine colon 26 adenocarcinoma in BALB/c mice. We found that the number of experimental lung metastases was increased after colon 26 cells were pretreated for 1 h with as little as 1 OIU/ml of IFN-gamma. 5-[125I] iodo-2'-deoxyuridine-radiolabeled colon 26 cells pretreated with IFN-gamma remained at higher level in the lung at 24h after intravenous injection than when the cells were not pretreated. In vivo elimination of asialo GM1-positive cells increased the number of lung metastases and, in such mice, there was no longer a difference in metastatic ability between control and IFN-gamma-treated cells. Colon 26 cells were completely resistant to lysis by isolated splenocytes. Splenocytes incubated in vitro with interleukin 2 exhibited moderate cytotoxicity against colon 26 cells, but there were no significant differences between control and IFN-gamma-treated cells. Colon 26 cells pretreated with IFN-gamma demonstrated resistance to tumor necrosis factor alpha-mediated growth inhibition. The enhancement of metastases by IFN-gamma was dependent on de novo protein synthesis since the enhancement was abolished by cycloheximide. Taken together, the data suggest that the metastatic ability of colon 26 cells pretreated with IFN-gamma is significantly higher due to the resistance to asialo GM1-positive cells accompanied with de novo protein synthesis.
