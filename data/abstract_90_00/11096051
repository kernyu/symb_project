Intensive high-flux hemodiafiltration is often used in the management of vancomycin toxicity. We describe two patients who developed hypophosphatemia as a consequence of this form of therapy. The first patient was treated with an intravenous phosphorus infusion. For the second patient, hypophosphatemia was corrected, during hemodiafiltration, with the use of a phosphorus-enriched dialysate. The latter dialysate was prepared by adding sodium phosphate salts to the "base concentrate" of a dual-concentrate, bicarbonate-based dialysate delivery system. This simple method was more efficient than intravenous therapy in ameliorating the hypophosphatemia secondary to aggressive hemodiafiltration treatment.
