1. A ribonuclease isolated from porcine thyroid cytosol using phenol: sodium dodecylsulfate treatment was associated with RNA and identical to latent alkaline ribonuclease. 2. Distribution of activity between aqueous and phenolic phases depended on pH, RNA, and ribonuclease inhibitor. 3. The ribonuclease was totally resistant to urea, guanidinium: HCl, chloroform:isoamyl alcohol, ethanol, heating at 100 degrees C for 10 min or at 80 degrees C plus 100 mM NaCl. It was highly resistant to hydrolysis by proteinase K except in the presence of detergent. 4. The extreme stability and other properties of latent alkaline ribonuclease could be the result of its association with RNA.
