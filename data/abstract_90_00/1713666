The nine possible single-base substitutions were produced at positions 913 to 915 of the 16S ribosomal RNA of Escherichia coli, a region known to be protected by streptomycin [Moazed, D. and Noller, H.F. (1987) Nature, 327, 389-394]. When the mutations were introduced into the expression vector pKK3535, only two of them (913A----G and 915A----G) permitted recovery of viable transformants. Ribosomes were isolated from the transformed bacteria and were assayed for their response to streptomycin in poly(U)- and MS2 RNA-directed assays. They were resistant to the stimulation of misreading and to the inhibition of protein synthesis by streptomycin, and this correlated with a decreased binding of the drug. These results therefore demonstrate that, in line with the footprinting studies of Moazed and Noller, mutations in the 915 region alter the interaction between the ribosome and streptomycin.
