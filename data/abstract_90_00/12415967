Resistance to antibiotics is considered the main reason for failure to eradicate Helicobacter pylori (HP). Resistance rates are different in developed and developing countries and are not known for Israel. We studied HP resistance rates in 40 patients who underwent esophagoduodenoscopy for various indications and were found to have gastric HP colonies. Sensitivity was determined by E-test, using clarythromycin, amoxycillin, clindamycin, erythromycin and metronidazole. The resistance rate for metronidazole was up to 67% but that for clindamycin was only 10%. HP was very sensitive to both macrolide antibiotics, erythromycin and clarythromycin.
