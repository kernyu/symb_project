The objective of this study was to compare the duration of serum bactericidal activity (SBA) for clarithromycin, azithromycin, and cefuroxime axetil in 12 young healthy volunteers after 5 days of therapy (dosed to steady-state) against two strains each of penicillin (PCN)-susceptible, -intermediate, and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. This was a randomized, 3-way crossover study. All isolates were susceptible to clarithromycin (MICs 0.125 mg/l) and azithromycin (MICs 0.25-0.5 mg/l), while cefuroxime axetil susceptibilities correlated with PCN. Results showed that SBA was maintained for 100% of the dosing interval for clarithromycin and 50-100% for azithromycin regardless of PCN susceptibility when standard doses were employed. Cefuroxime axetil was active only against the PCN-susceptible isolate for 50% of the dosing interval, indicating that it should only be used for PCN-susceptible S. pneumoniae.
