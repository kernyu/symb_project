Panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) is a mixture of panipenem (PAPM), carbapenem antibiotic, and betamipron (BP), N-benzoyl-beta-alanine. The adverse reaction to PAPM of the kidney is reduced by the addition of BP to PAPM which inhibits the anion transport in the kidney tubules. We studied the pharmacokinetics and the clinical efficacies of PAPM/BP in children and we evaluated the antibacterial activities of PAPM by determining MIC values of PAPM in vitro against organisms isolated in our children's hospital from January to December, 1990. 1. Pharmacokinetics 10 mg/kg of PAPM/BP (10 mg PAPM/10 mg BP) was administered intravenously by drip infusion to 7 children. The mean blood concentration of PAPM was 14.8 micrograms/ml at the peak, and the mean half life was 0.9 hours in blood. PAPM was not detected in blood 3 hours after the time when the peak values were attained. 2. Clinical studies 10 mg/kg of PAPM/BP was administered intravenously 3 times a day to 18 cases including 15 of respiratory infections, 2 of otitis media and 1 of sepsis. The clinical efficacies of PAPM/BP were excellent or good in 17 out of the 18 cases. All causative organisms isolated in 5 cases, Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (1 case), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Haemophilus influenzae (2) and Branhamella catarrhalis (1) were eradicated in a few days upon the administrations of PAPM/BP. No adverse reactions due to PAPM/BP were observed, but a slight elevation of platelet counts in blood was observed in 1 case, which was normalized soon after the end of the treatment. 3.
