The development of resistance of collection and freshly isolated S. aureus and C. albicans strains to the antiseptic decamethoxim and an original diarylcyclohexane derivative was studied comparatively in vitro. It was shown that the rate of the resistance development was low. After 20 subcultures in the presence of increasing concentrations of decamethoxin, its sensitivity of S. aureus and C. albicans decreased 16-32 and 16-fold respectively. After 20 subcultures in the presence of increasing doses of the diarylcyclohexane derivative, its sensitivity S. aureus and C. albicans decreased 4- and 4-8-fold, respectively. It was found that in the hospital strains of S. aureus and C. albicans, the antibiotic resistance and sensitivity to decamethoxin and the diarylcyclohexane remained high, which indicated that there was no cross resistance to these compounds in the strains studied.
