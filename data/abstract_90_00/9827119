From April to November 1994, we carried out a study in Rufisque, an urban area located in Dakar Region. During dry season, 5.32% of febrile outpatients were infected with Plasmodium falciparum with a mean parasitic density evaluated at 12,471 p/microliter. One case of cerebral malaria was noted. During raining season, malaria represented 58.75% of the fevers. Ten presented neurological signs; the mean parasitic density was high, 131,140 p/microliter. Two children died. Good efficiency of quinine was noted but chloroquine treatment failures was present: 50%. Generally malaria is less prevalent in urban areas. But in Rufisque ecological conditions are main factors which permit spreading of the disease. Prior measures of control such correct treatment of cases and good management of environment must be done.
