The purpose of this study was to determine whether vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) dilates resistance arterioles in the in situ systemic circulation and whether inhibitors of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE), two membrane-bound metalloenzymes that are widely distributed in the microcirculation and cleave and inactive VIP, potentiate this response. Using intravital microscopy, we found that VIP (0.05 and 0.1 nmol) induced significant vasodilation in the hamster cheek pouch (13 +/- 1 and 20 +/- 2% increase from baseline, respectively; mean +/- SE; P < 0.05). These responses were significantly potentiated by topical application of phosphoramidon and thiorphan, two relatively selective NEP inhibitors, but not by captopril, a relatively selective ACE inhibitor. Furthermore, suffusion of a mixture of proteinase inhibitors consisting of leupeptin, Bestatin, and DL-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethylthiopropanoic acid to inhibit serine proteinases, including mast cell tryptase, aminopeptidases, and carboxypeptidase N, respectively, had no significant effects on VIP-induced responses. These data indicate that VIP elicits vasodilation in the in situ systemic microcirculation and that NEP modulates this response.
