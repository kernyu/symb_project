Trimethoprim monotherapy was applied in 50 cases. Recovery was obtained in 18 patients (36%), improvement in 15 patients (30%), and in 17 cases (34%) no change was observed in response to the therapy. Trimethoprim therapy may be successfully used in acute and chronic cystitis and urethritis-especially in E. coli infections. The therapy is significantly less effective in urinary tract infections caused by other Gram-negative and Gram-positive micro-organisms. In the course of drug therapy only a few side-effects were observed.
