We report a case of pulmonary Nocardia (N.) otitidiscaviarum infection in a 76-year-old man with chronic respiratory infection. The patient responded poorly to intravenous imipenem and oral minocycline, but later improved after treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Pulmonary infection with N. otitidiscaviarum should be considered in the differential diagnosis of chronic respiratory infections. Further studies are needed to evaluate the correlation between species and drug susceptibility.
