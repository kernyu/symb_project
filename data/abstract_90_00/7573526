Insulinopenic diabetes is known to produce endothelial dysfunction. This dysfunction could arise from either hyperglycemia or inadequate insulin. It is not known whether endothelial dysfunction occurs when hyperglycemia is present with elevated insulin levels. In this study, we utilized an experimental model of hyperglycemia with hyperinsulinemia to investigate latent endothelial dysfunction. Rats were continuously infused with glucose or saline for 72 h to achieve peak plasma glucose concentrations of approximately 25 mM. Plasma insulin rose by 12-fold in glucose-infused rats. No significant differences in serum electrolyte concentration were noted between control and glucose-infused rats after 72 h. Blood pressure was not altered by this intervention. Aortic rings taken from control rats relaxed to the endothelium-dependent vasodilators, acetylcholine and A-23187, and to the endothelium-independent vasodilator, nitroglycerin. Relaxation to acetylcholine but not to A-23187 or nitroglycerin was impaired in glucose-infused rat aortic rings. Incubation in vitro with either indomethacin or superoxide dismutase did not restore the impaired relaxation to acetylcholine in rings taken from glucose-infused rats. Thus hyperglycemia with hyperinsulinemia selectively impairs receptor-dependent, endothelium-dependent relaxation. These studies suggest that elevated glucose may be a common pathway leading to endothelial dysfunction in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia-induced insulin resistance.
