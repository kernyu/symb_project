Twenty healthy controls and 385 adult patients suffering from acute enteritis or gastroenteritis were enrolled for the study of Campylobacter Jejuni infection over a period of 2 years. Thirty five stool samples showed C jejuni on stool culture. The isolation rates were at peak in the monsoon season and from watery and bloody stool specimens. Pure C jejuni culture was obtained in 18 of 35 samples; the other 17 samples showed polymicrobial infection or infestation. Nine of 35 patients were treated with erythromycin 1 g in divided doses for 7 days. Repeat stool cultures did not grow C jejuni. There was no resistance to erythromycin therapy. C jejuni are fastidious organisms and require special medium and microaerophilic environment for culture.
