Aged or immuno-compromised patients were mostly affected, by pneumonia caused by infection of MRSA, and more than half of the cases were superinfected with glucose-nonfermentative Gram-negative rods including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These patients were treated with a monotherapy of arbekacin (ABK) by intravenous drip administration or with a combination of ABK and imipenem/cilastatin, ceftazidime or antifungals. The clinical efficiencies were 55.6% in 11 monotherapy cases and 83.3% in combined therapy. MRSA was eradicated in 31.9% of the patients. These results are comparable with, or superior to the vancomycin therapy in the treatment of MRSA pneumonia. When MRSA is isolated from sputum of pneumonia patients, the discrimination between colonization and infection is important, but the diagnosis is very difficult in many clinical cases before the initiation of chemotherapy. The number of bacteria and the grade of inflammation should be carefully scored before starting a chemotherapy.
