To understand the cellular and biochemical nature of radioresistance in the strain M5 derived from Chinese hamster V79 cells, the sensitivity of the resistant cells towards CdCl2, Zn(Ac)2, and H2O2 by the colony forming ability has been tested. D0 values for these compounds in Chinese hamster V79 cells were 5.4 microM, 27.8 microM and 4.3 micrograms/ml respectively while for M5 cells these were 8.3 microM, 142.9 microM and 11.9 micrograms/ml respectively. The resistance to heavy metals as well as the oxidative damage could be reversed by the inhibition of glutathione synthesis by the drug buthionine sulfoximine (BSO). These set of data indicate that the cellular antioxidant glutathione plays an important role in the observed oxidant-resistant phenotype as well as heavy metal resistance in M5 cells.
