Three fecal egg count reduction assays (FECR) and one critical trial were performed to determine the efficacy of pyrantel pamoate (PP) at 6.6 mg base kg-1 on a well managed stud farm in Louisiana where a loss of efficacy was suspected. Efficacy of PP based on FECR varied from 25% in mares to 83% in yearlings. Second treatments with PP 2 weeks following an initial treatment failed to reduce eggs per gram (EPG). A critical trial was performed to determine the cyathostome species resistant to PP. Three strongyle-naive ponies which acquired infections on the farm were used for this purpose. Following treatment with PP at the recommended dose, 11 species of cyathostomes remained in the intestine of the tracer ponies. Reduced efficacies (62%-88%) were noted for seven species. Resistance to oxibendazole (OBZ), which was > 90% effective on this farm in 1982, was also evaluated by FECR and found to exist. The results of one experiment indicate that dual resistance of parasites to PP and OBZ also exists.
