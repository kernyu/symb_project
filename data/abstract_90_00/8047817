There is now a persuasive body of evidence linking Helicobacter pylori infection and peptic ulcer disease. Over 90% of duodenal ulcer and 70% of gastric ulcer patients are infected with H. pylori. Only a minority of infected patients develop ulcers, however, and host cofactors, rather than H. pylori strain, are probably critical to the development of peptic ulcer in infected individuals. Conversely, not all ulcers are associated with H. pylori, and in these cases enterogastric reflux and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ingestion may be important. Eradication of H. pylori dramatically reduces ulcer relapse, effectively curing the disease. Eradication may also accelerate duodenal ulcer healing. Triple therapy with bismuth and antibiotics is effective against H. pylori, but there are problems with side effects, compliance and antibiotic resistance. Encouraging results are emerging on the efficacy and safety of omeprazole/antibiotic combination therapy, and this novel approach to H. pylori eradication is an exciting development. H. pylori has established itself as a pivotal factor in peptic ulcer disease and an effective helicobactericidal regimen is now the most rational and cost-effective treatment.
