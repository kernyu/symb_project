Four volunteers were involved for 5 weeks of a baseline period, followed by 7 weeks of a combined supplementation of nicotinamide, zinc, and carotenoids (Nicoplex). Blood sampling and bioassays were carried out every week during the evaluation period. The supplementation of Nicoplex resulted in statistically significant increased resistance to DNA single-strand breaks induced by H2O2 (DNA retained on filter % from 46.7 +/- 1.9 to 59.4 +/- 4.3; p < 0.01), increased DNA repair 60 min after induction of damage (DNA retained on filter % from 74.6 +/- 4.8 to 88.3 +/- 4.2; p < 0.01), elevated poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activity (p < 0.05), and an increased proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) (p < 0.05) when compared with the levels before supplementation. However, when the same subjects were supplemented with nicotinamide, zinc, and carotenoids together with another 17 nutrients or minerals, there were no changes in DNA damage, DNA repair, or proliferative response to PHA. Through the use of a rat model, DNA repair of splenocytes 3 h after 12 Gy whole-body irradiation was significantly enhanced in rats supplemented with Nicoplex for 6 weeks (p < 0.05) and 8 weeks (p < 0.01). Comparison of Nicoplex and its components administered separately revealed that there was an additive effect on DNA repair for both single- and double-strand breaks (both p < 0.05). On the basis of the results, it is hypothesized that the enhanced effect of combined supplement of nicotinamide, zinc, and carotenoids on DNA repair depends on their diversified mechanisms of action while multinutrient supplementation may compromise the effects by inhibitory interactions including uptake and absorption.
