The ability of seven methods to detect high-level gentamicin (58 strains) and streptomycin resistance (56 strains) among 107 Enterococcus faecalis isolates was investigated at the University of Chicago Medical Center and the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Methods included a standard agar screen plate, high-content disk diffusion, Remel (Lenexa, Kans.) EF Synergy Quad plates, standard microdilution panels prepared in house, Pasco MIC Gram-Positive panels (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.), MicroScan MIC Type 5 dry panels (Baxter Healthcare Corp., MicroScan Div., West Sacramento, Calif.), and Vitek GPS-TA cards (Vitek Systems Inc., Hazelwood, Mo.). Results indicating false resistance were not obtained by any method, and there was 100% agreement between the results of the disk diffusion and standard agar screen methods. Prolonging incubation from 24 to 48 h increased resistance detection for both agar and microdilution screens. EF Synergy Quad plates inoculated with micropipettes detected 100% of the streptomycin- and gentamicin-resistant isolates. Resistance detection for streptomycin and gentamicin, respectively, was 93 and 96% by standard microdilution, 93 and 98% by Pasco panels, 88 and 89% by MicroScan panels, and 88 and 91% by Vitek GPS-TA cards. False susceptibility occurred more frequently with streptomycin-resistant isolates than it did with gentamicin-resistant strains and appeared to be strain related in some instances. The use of an increased inoculum size enhanced resistance detection with these strains, but it complicated interpretation of results and led to the selection of streptomycin-resistant mutants. Until results of further studies delineate optimum test conditions, a delay in the final interpretation of agar and microdilution screen results until 48 h for isolates showing no or light growth at 24 h may help to minimize the occurrence of false susceptibility reporting.
