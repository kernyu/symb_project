Most coronal radicular reconstructions are made of cast inlay core metals or prefabricated posts covered in composite. The differences in the mechanical properties of these elements create a heterogeneous mass with inconsistent mechanical behavior. Studies using the Finite Element Method have shown the biomechanical disturbances caused by the inclusion of materials with a modulus of elasticity that is superior to that of dentine (i.e., nickel, chrome, zircon, etc). The use of materials with a modulus of elasticity close to that of dentine does not disturb the flow of stress inside the root. To our knowledge, only a composite material structured with programmable mechanical properties would be capable of producing both high mechanical performance and a modulus of elasticity adapted to dentine values. The C-POST, made of carbon epoxy, accommodates the demands of the dentine, as well as the in vitro stress linked to the prosthesis. The internal structure, consisting of long high-performance carbon fibers, unidirectionally and equally stretched, confers a totally original behavior that is adapted to clinical objectives. In addition, the C-POST has a fracture resistance superior to most metals.
