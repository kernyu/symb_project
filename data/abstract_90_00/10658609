Siderophores are microbial iron chelating agents that sequester physiologically essential iron for microbes. Conjugation of drugs to siderophores allows use of active iron transport for microbially directed drug delivery. Syntheses and biological studies are described of the first multidrug isocyanurate-based siderophore analogues separately containing one, two, and three 5-fluorouridine (5-FU) derivatives as the drug component. The results indicate that a single siderophore can be used to deliver multiple drugs to target pathogenic microorganisms.
