Antibacterial activity of eremomycin, a novel glycopeptide antibiotic, against obligate anaerobic Gram-positive++ bacteria was studied. Eremomycin was shown to inhibit the growth of obligate anaerobic Gram-positive++ cocci and bacteria belonging to Clostridium in rather low concentrations and within narrow ranges of the MIC which was indicative of the antibiotic undoubted advantages. The antibacterial activity of eremomycin was 2 times as high as that of vancomycin and 8 times as high as that of ristomycin with respect to Gram-positive++ anaerobic cocci. Pathogenic strains of Clostridium spp. were 2 to 4 times more sensitive to eremomycin than to vancomycin. A significant property of the novel glycopeptide antibiotic was shown to be its capacity for inhibiting the growth of Gram-positive++ aerobic and obligate anaerobic cocci within the same concentration ranges which might be of importance in monotherapy of mixed aerobic and anaerobic infections.
