In the past, parasite control in domestic animals has relied mainly on the use of drugs and pesticides. Although these compounds are still of great importance in the prevention and treatment of parasitic diseases, in recent years the emphasis has shifted to a more flexible approach, integrating various other control measures. The main reasons for this change are:--development of parasite resistance to the compounds used; --reduced development of new compounds to overcome resistance (increasingly more stringent regulations on toxicity and residues, resulting in very high research and development costs, insufficient return for industry because of the short life-span of new products due to resistance and because the market for compounds in developing countries is limited and poor);--increasing cost of new products for consumers;--problems associated with toxicity, environmental pollution and residues in animal products. Integrated parasite management makes use, where possible, of biological and mechanical control, of acquired and innate host resistance, and genetical, ecological, sanitary and regulatory procedures, although chemical control can seldom be entirely eliminated. Cost-effectiveness and sustainability in all respects are of primary importance.
