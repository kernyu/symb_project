Over the last ten years, opportunistic infections with ubiquitous mycobacteria have increased greatly in importance. In particular immunosuppressed patients are affected. Given that present methods of detection are much improved, there has still been a "real" increase in such diseases. For the interpretation of findings in HIV-positive patients, special criteria apply. In the case of AIDS patients, virtually all the organs may be affected, while in HIV-negative patients, chronic diseases of the lungs, lymphadenopathies and infections of the skin and soft tissues predominate. The differentiation between tuberculosis pathogens and ubiquitous mycobacteria is the all-important task of the diagnostic laboratory. Owing to the high resistance of the pathogens, treatment is often problematic.
