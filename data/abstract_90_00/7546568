The course of drug development for the treatment of HIV-1 infection and AIDS is being revolutionized by high-resolution structures of essential viral proteins. We survey the impact on drug design of the recently elucidated structural knowledge of two essential enzymes, reverse transcriptase and protease, and three new targets, the viral integrase and the gene regulatory protein-RNA interactions, Tat-TAR and Rev-RRE.
