Genotypes that confer drug resistance were evaluated in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) proviral DNA obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and lymphoid tissue at baseline and after 8 weeks of therapy with zidovudine alone or in combination with didanosine from 22 patients (8 zidovudine-naive and 14 zidovudine-experienced). There was evidence of zidovudine resistance at codon 215 in 27.3% (6/22) of patients. All 20 patients evaluable for codon 74 (site of didanosine resistance) had virus that remained wild type during the 8-week study period. When HIV proviral DNA from PBMC was compared with that from lymphoid tissue, 94.7% (18/19) of evaluable samples were concordant at codon 215 at baseline, while 85.7% (12/14) were concordant at week 8. Resistance in PBMC (but not in lymphoid tissue) developed in 1 of 8 zidovudine-naive patients; an increased proportion of resistant strains in PBMC (but not in lymphoid tissue) was observed in 2 of 14 zidovudine-experienced patients. These results suggest high concordance for drug resistance mutations in HIV proviral DNA from blood and lymph node tissue.
