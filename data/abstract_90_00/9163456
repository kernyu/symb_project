The reliability of methods for determination of Helicobacter pylori resistance to metronidazole has been found to depend upon the incubation time. Because the disk diffusion method is more vulnerable than other methods to prolonged incubation, this method has not been recommended for H. pylori. However, because media designed for rapid growth of H. pylori have been introduced, the time has come to look at the clinical usefulness of this inexpensive and simple method again. The correlation of readings obtained with the E test (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) and Rosco's (Taastrup, Denmark) disk diffusion method for in vitro metronidazole resistance determination for H. pylori with a short incubation time (24 to 31 h) was studied. Plates which could not be read after 24 to 31 h were reincubated for another night. Fifty-seven consecutive clinical strains were tested. Because the rate of regrowth of H. pylori depends upon the age of the colonies inoculated, the reproducibility of resistance test results for young colonies versus old colonies was also studied. Resistance plates could be read after 24 to 31 h of incubation for 28 of 29 strains when the inoculum consisted of young colonies (3 to 4 days old). For these 29 strains, a high correlation (r = -0.937) was found between results obtained with the E test and those obtained with the disk diffusion test. A poorer correlation was found for old colonies (> or = 5 days old) (r = -0.742), which required a prolonged incubation for 8 of 23 strains. In conclusion, short incubation was successfully applied with young colonies. Results obtained with the simple and inexpensive disk diffusion method correlated well with those obtained with the E test.
