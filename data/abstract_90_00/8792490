In recent years enterococci, and Enterococcus faecium in particular, have emerged as important nosocomial pathogens. Of major concern is the increasing antimicrobial resistance to traditionally used agents such as ampicillin, gentamicin and vancomycin. We present a patient with prosthetic heart valves colonized with vancomycin-resistant E. faecium. This is the first reported isolation of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium in Sweden.
