The gene specifying the ethidium efflux system of Escherichia coli has been cloned on a 3.2 kbp HindIII fragment and located on a 1.2 kbp fragment within this. Cross-resistance studies indicate that the system has a broad specificity for monovalent cations and the gene shows no hybridisation with similar genes found in Staphylococci.
