Digital image analysis showed that reductions in biofilm plating efficiency were due to the loss of protection provided by two benzoate-degrading strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens. This loss in protection was due to the spatial separation of the protective organisms from benzoate-sensitive organisms during the dilution process. Communities were cultivated in flow cells irrigated with trypticase soy broth. When the effluent from these flow cells was plated on 0.15% benzoic acid, satellite colonies formed only in the vicinity of primary colonies. A digital image analysis procedure was developed to measure the size and spatial distribution of these satellites as a function of distance from the primary colony. The size of satellites served as a measure of growth, and the number per unit area served as a measure of survival. At the three dilutions tested, the size and concentration of satellite colonies varied inversely with distance from the primary colonies. When these measurements were plotted, the slopes were used to quantify the effect of bacterial association on the growth and survivability of the satellites. In the absence of the primary colonies, satellites grew in axenic culture only at low benzoate concentrations. Thus benzoate-degrading organisms are capable of creating a protective microenvironment for other members of biofilm communities.
