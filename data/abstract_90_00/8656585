We measured th in vitro antimicrobial activity of a new quinolone, levofloxacin (LVFX) against seven clinically isolated species of atypical mycobacteria, including 30 strains of M. avium complex. 8 of M. fortuitum, 4 of M. scrofulaceum, 2 of M. kansasii, 2 of M. gordonae, and 1 of M. chelonae (subsp chelonae). LVFX showed a potent antimicrobial activity against M. kansasii, M. gordonae and M. chelonae (subsp chelonae). In addition, it was suggested that LVFX may be effective for the treatment of infections caused by M. avium complex, since satisfactory antimicrobial activity was displayed against some strains of M. avium complex. Considering the fact that LVFX shows good concentration levers in sputum, this drug could be used in the chemotherapy against the infection with M. avium complex.
