The Rhizobium meliloti bacA gene encodes a function that is essential for bacterial differentiation into bacteroids within plant cells in the symbiosis between R. meliloti and alfalfa. An Escherichia coli homolog of BacA, SbmA, is implicated in the uptake of microcin B17, microcin J25 (formerly microcin 25), and bleomycin. When expressed in E. coli with the lacZ promoter, the R. meliloti bacA gene was found to suppress all the known defects of E. coli sbmA mutants, namely, increased resistance to microcin B17, microcin J25, and bleomycin, demonstrating the functional similarity between the two proteins. The R. meliloti bacA386::Tn(pho)A mutant, as well as a newly constructed bacA deletion mutant, was found to show increased resistance to bleomycin. However, it also showed increased resistance to certain aminoglycosides and increased sensitivity to ethanol and detergents, suggesting that the loss of bacA function causes some defect in membrane integrity. The E. coli sbmA gene suppressed all these bacA mutant phenotypes as well as the Fix- phenotype when placed under control of the bacA promoter. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the BacA and SbmA proteins are functionally similar and thus provide support for our previous hypothesis that BacA may be required for uptake of some compound that plays an important role in bacteroid development. However, the additional phenotypes of bacA mutants identified in this study suggest the alternative possibility that BacA may be needed for membrane integrity, which is likely to be critically important during the early stages of bacterial differentiation within plant cells.
