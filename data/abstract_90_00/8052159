The morphologic changes from bacillary to coccoid forms of Helicobacter pylori were studied. These form changes were analyzed by bacterial growth in Brucella broth plus 2% fetal calf serum. The coccoid forms were observed at five days of incubation and a rapid decrease of CFU/ml was recorded. At two weeks of microaerophilic incubation, all coccoid forms observed were not culturable in vitro. The coccoid morphology was observed earlier when the culture of H. pylori was incubated in aerobic conditions and with subinhibitory concentrations of omeprazole and roxithromycin. To evaluate the possibility of resistance of coccal forms, before plating, the cultures were heated to 80 C for 10 min and sonicated. In the absence of these treatments the cultures did not show growth in vitro. The proteic patterns of the same strains of two different morphologies were studied revealing significant differences.
