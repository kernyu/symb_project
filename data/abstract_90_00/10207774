For respiratory tract infection (RTI), antibiotics should have proven clinical efficacy against the major pathogens involved-Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. As the pattern of resistance to antimicrobials changes, the clinical effectiveness of these agents should be reviewed. However, clinical trials are time consuming and costly, and alternative ways of predicting clinical efficacy using susceptibility data have been investigated. Pharmacodynamic breakpoints have been suggested as providing the link between susceptibility data and clinical effectiveness and this is supported by emerging clinical evidence. Thus, using the data collected in the Alexander Project, guidelines for the treatment of RTI can be developed which reflect the local resistance profile and maximize the chances of clinical success.
