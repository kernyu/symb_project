A gramicidin S analog ([Orn1,1']GS.4HCl) containing L-ornithine in place of L-valine at the 1,1' positions was synthesized by the conventional solution method in order to examine whether this analog had antibacterial activity toward Gram-negative bacteria. In the synthesis of [Orn1,1']GS.4HCl, two intermediate analogs ([Orn1,1', Orn(For)2,2']GS.2HCl and [Orn(Z)1,1']GS.2HCl) were obtained. [Orn1,1']GS.4HCl and [Orn1,1', Orn(For)2,2']GS.2HCl showed no activity toward either Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria, whereas [Orn(Z)1,1']GS.2HCl showed appreciable activity toward only Gram-positive bacteria.
