The microbiological surveillance of pneumococci according to the Protocols for the International Surveillance of Pneumococci Resistant to Penicillin and Other Antimicrobial Agents developed by Prof. M. Jacobs (USA) and Prof. P. Appelbaum (USA) made it possible for the first time in Russia to detect the strains with moderate resistance to penicillin. It is necessary to revise the current Russian recommendations for the laboratory diagnosis of pneumococcal infection and the determination of antibiotic susceptibility so as to participate in the united programme of the International Surveillance of Penicillin Resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae.
