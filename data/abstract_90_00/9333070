A beta-lactam-sensitive strain (C152) of Shigella dysenteriae showed two major outer membrane proteins (OMPs) with M(r)s of 43,000 and 38,000, while the clinical isolate M2 lacked the 43,000-Mr OMP, which acted as a channel for beta-lactam antibiotics. Permeability of beta-lactams across the outer membrane (OM) of M2 was lower than that across the OM of C152. Mutants deficient in the 43-kDa OMP could be selected in vitro from strain C152 in the presence of cefoxitin. All beta-lactam-resistant strains were sensitive to imipenem.
