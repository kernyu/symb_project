AIM: To evaluate clarithromycin 500 mg t.d.s., tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate 240 mg b.d. and omeprazole 20 mg b.d. for 7 days as a Helicobacter pylori treatment regimen. METHODS: The H. pylori status of dyspeptic patients undergoing endoscopy was assessed by histology, culture and rapid urease testing of biopsies and by 13C-urea breath test. Fifty patients who were H. pylori-positive were treated with the above treatment regimen for 7 days. Those patients with active duodenal ulcers present at endoscopy were given omeprazole 20 mg nocte for a further 21 days. Not less than 28 days after completing treatment, all tests were repeated to reassess H. pylori status. Bacterial sensitivity of H. pylori cultures was determined and patients recorded any side-effects. RESULTS: On an intention-to-treat basis, H. pylori infection was cured in 90% (95% CI: 78-96%) of patients. Taste disturbance was experienced by 35% patients. Compliance was excellent, with 96% patients taking more than 95% of tablets. Metronidazole resistance was 41% but all cultures were sensitive to clarithromycin. CONCLUSIONS: This 7-day treatment achieved a high level of cure of H. pylori infection with relatively minor side-effects. It may have a role to play, particularly where there is a high level of metronidazole resistance.
