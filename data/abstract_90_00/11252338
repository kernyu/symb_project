The bactericidal activity in vitro of cefpirome plus either vancomycin or teicoplanin was compared with that of a cefamandole-vancomycin combination against ten clinical isolates of homogeneous methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Cefpirome (0.125 x MIC) combined with vancomycin (0.5-2 x MIC) or teicoplanin (0.5-4 x MIC) acted synergically against the ten isolates. Similar effects were observed with the cefamandole-vancomycin combination, except that for one isolate, higher cefamandole concentrations (0.25-1 x MIC) were required.
