For Staphylococcus aureus, stepwise mutations result in high-level quinolone resistance. Methicillin-resistant and -susceptible quinolone-resistant, first-step mutants generated in vitro were obtained and found to be no different than those recovered from murine abscesses. Approximately 10% of all first-step mutants were resistant to ethidium bromide, and selected strains had mutations that mapped to flqB. NorA-mediated resistance among first-step mutants may be more prevalent than previously reported.
