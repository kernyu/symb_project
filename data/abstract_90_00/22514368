A Canadian adult with bacteremic pneumonia caused by a relatively penicillin-resistant (minimal inhibitory concentration 0.25 mug/mL) Streptococcus pneumoniae is reported, and the published literature regarding penicillin-resistant pneumococci in Canada reviewed. Although penicillin resistance has been reported infrequently to date, this case emphasizes the need for routine antimicrobial sensitivity testing of all pneumococci isolated from normally sterile sites, and for ongoing systematic surveillance for penicillin and other antibiotic resistance in Canada.
