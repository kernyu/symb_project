Many Bacteroides clinical isolates carry large conjugative transposons that, in addition to transferring themselves, excise, circularize, and transfer smaller, unlinked chromosomal DNA segments called NBUs (nonreplicating Bacteroides units). We report the localization and DNA sequence of a region of one of the NBUs, NBU1, that was necessary and sufficient for mobilization by Bacteroides conjugative transposons and by IncP plasmids. The fact that the mobilization region was internal to NBU1 indicates that the circular form of NBU1 is the form that is mobilized. The NBU1 mobilization region contained a single large (1.4-kbp) open reading frame (ORF1), which was designated mob. The oriT was located within a 220-bp region upstream of mob. The deduced amino acid sequence of the mob product had no significant similarity to those of mobilization proteins of well-characterized Escherichia coli group plasmids such as RK2 or of either of the two mobilization proteins of Bacteroides plasmid pBFTM10. There was, however, a high level of similarity between the deduced amino acid sequence of the mob product and that of the product of a Bacteroides vulgatus cryptic open reading frame closely linked to a cefoxitin resistance gene (cfxA).
