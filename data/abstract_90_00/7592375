The nucleotide sequence of a region upstream of the type II polyketide synthase genes in the cluster for biosynthesis of the polyketide antibiotic jadomycin B in Streptomyces venezuelae contained an open reading frame encoding a sequence of 196 amino acids that resembeled sequences deduced for a group of repressor proteins. The strongest similarity was to EnvR of Escherichia coli, but the sequence also resembled MtrR, AcrR, TetC, and TcmR, all of which are involved in regulating resistance to antibiotics or toxic hydrophobic substances in the environment. Disruption of the nucleotide sequence of this putative S. venezuelae repressor gene (jadR2), by insertion of an apramycin resistance gene at an internal MluI site, and replacement of the chromosomal gene generated mutants that produced jadomycin B without the stress treatments (exposure to heat shock or to toxic concentrations of ethanol) required for jadomycin B production by the wild type. When cultures of the disruption mutants were ethanol stressed, they overproduced the antibiotic. From these results it was concluded that expression of the jadomycin B biosynthesis genes are negatively regulated by jadR2.
