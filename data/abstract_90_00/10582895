SCH27899, an everninomicin antibiotic, was tested for its in vitro activity against 718 bacterial isolates representing 27 species. The Enterobacteriaceae and nonenteric gram-negative bacilli were resistant to > or = 8.0 microg/ml, but all others were inhibited by < or = 1.0 microg/ml. When tested in combination with 17 other antimicrobial agents against 110 strains, SCH27899 demonstrated no significant antagonism or synergy. Consequently, combination therapy is not contraindicated.
