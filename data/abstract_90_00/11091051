We have analysed the expenditure on antimicrobial drugs in the largest hospital in Italy; over this period, a committee prepared an antibiotic policy document. This formulary lists all antimicrobial drugs available in the hospital. Some drugs were removed from the list and others are only available on special request for a named patient. In the hope of optimising drug utilisation, we included all the reasons for the choice of agent in the document. The introduction of this formulary resulted in an immediate saving and perhaps in the future we shall also observe an improvement in bacterial resistance patterns.
