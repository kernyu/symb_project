Gram-positive cocci are important causes of infection both in the community and in the hospital, with repercussions on mortality and increased economic costs. Treatment of these infections is made difficult by the increasing emergence of multi-resistant organisms, primarily among Gram-positive cocci, such as vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci. Linezolid, a member of the new class of synthetic antimicrobials named oxazolidinones, has several favourable characteristics including high activity against multiresistant Gram-positive cocci. In a number of clinical trials, linezolid showed good clinical and microbiologic efficacy in the therapy of infections caused by these organisms. It can be considered a valid option for treating both community- and hospital-acquired infections due to multiresistant Gram-positive cocci.
