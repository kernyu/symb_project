UNLABELLED: We present here GRANT ( G enotypic R esistance An alysis T ool), a program that automatically detects resistance-related mutations in HIV-1 protein sequences, and comments on the degree of resistance conferred when possible. This program is easily user-customizable, allowing immediate updates as new resistance mutations are discovered, or use with an organism other than HIV. AVAILABILITY: The package is available free of charge over the internet, either directly from the authors, or by anonymous ftp (ftp. infobiogen.fr/pub/logiciels/mac/biology or windows as appropriate). Versions exist for PPC and 68K Apple Macintosh running MacOS 7.5 or higher. Microsoft Excel 5.0 is required for quality output. A PC version is in progress. CONTACT: goujon@infobiogen.fr
