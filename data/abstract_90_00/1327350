The authors present a study of the in vitro susceptibility to O/129 compound and usual antibiotics of 29 strains of V. cholerae O:1 biotype El Tor isolated during epidemics in miscellaneous countries over the world from 1982 to 1991. Several identical isolates from the same epidemic are represented by one strain. Susceptibility testing by diffusion method and MICs by agar dilution method are used. The data show that the resistance to O/129 compound is often associated with the resistance to usual antibiotics such as trimethoprim, sulphonamides, chloramphenicol, ampicillin and tetracycline. This resistance to the vibrostatic compound leads to a double problem of diagnosis and therapy. The nitrofuranes derivatives and tiliquinol-tilbroquinol association, an intestinal antiseptic, are the most active antimicrobial agents as well on the strains O/129 sensitive as on the strains O/129 resistant.
