The transcriptional activation of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes by both type I (alpha/beta) and II (gamma) interferons (IFNs) has been extensively studied, and it has been shown that the upregulation of several DNA-binding proteins is critical for this process. In our laboratory, we introduced the mouse H-2Kb gene into the AKR mouse leukaemia cell line K36.16 to effect the generation of tumor-specific immunity. Individual clones were selected and studied. Whereas the MHC class I genes in most of the clones obtained could be stimulated by interferons, one of the clones obtained, clone Kb-S27, failed to be induced, or was at best poorly induced by IFN-alpha/beta and -gamma. Both the exogenous H-2Kb and the endogenous H-2Dk genes behaved in the same manner and were not stimulated by IFNs. The lack of response to IFNs by clone Kb-S27 also resulted in its resistance to the antiproliferative effects of IFNs. This lack of IFN-induction by clone Kb-S27 was not simply due to a change in its surface interferon receptors. Gel-retardation assay and northern blot analysis both demonstrated the lack of induction of the IRF-1 DNA-binding factor in clone Kb-S27. In addition, northern blot analysis showed that the IRF-2 gene expression in clone Kb-S27 was upregulated when compared with the other IFN-inducible clones.
