Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are multiresistant bacteria, known to cause nosocomial infections. We present a report on a two and a half year-old, recently adopted, child, who suffered from otitis media with discharge. The child was treated with penicillin in Norway without success. Culture revealed methicillin-resistant S aureus. Methicillin-resistant S aureus were also found in the noses of the adoptive parents. After a second unsuccessful course of antibiotics the child was admitted to the Ear, nose, and throat department and was subsequently treated with intravenous vancomycin, mastoidectomy and eradication of the nasal methicillin-resistant S aureus carriage. The admittance to the Ear, nose, and throat department was carefully planned. All departments concerned were thoroughly briefed. The patient was given vancomycin intravenously for 18 days, partly as an out-patient. Subsequent control cultures from the patient and the adoptive parents have all been negative. No one dealing with the patient has been infected. The case illustrates the importance of thorough planning and co-operation between different departments.
