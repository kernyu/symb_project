Three pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins of tobacco are acidic isoforms of beta-1,3-glucanase (PR-2a, -2b, -2c). We have cloned and sequenced a partial cDNA clone (lambda FJ1) corresponding to one of the PR-2 beta-1,3-glucanases. A small gene family encodes the PR-2 proteins in tobacco, and similar genes are present in a number of plant species. We analyzed the stress and developmental regulation of the tobacco PR-2 beta-1,3-glucanases by using northern and western analyses and a new technique to assay enzymatic activity. Stress caused by both thiamine and tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) infection resulted in a dramatic increase in the levels of PR-2 mRNA, protein, and enzyme activities. The increased PR-2 gene expression in upper uninoculated leaves of plants infected with TMV also suggests a role in systemic acquired resistance. During floral development, a number of beta-1,3-glucanase activities were observed in all flower tissues. However, PR-2 polypeptides were observed only in sepal tissue. In contrast, an mRNA that hybridized to the PR-2 cDNA was present in stigma/style tissue and the sepals. Primer extension analysis confirmed the identity of the PR-2 mRNA in sepals, but indicated that the beta-1,3-glucanase gene expressed in the stigma/style of flowers was distinct from the PR-2 genes. The induction of PR-2 protein synthesis by both stress and developmental signals was accompanied by a corresponding increase in the steady-state levels of PR-2 mRNA, suggesting that PR-2 gene expression is regulated, in part, at the level of mRNA accumulation.
