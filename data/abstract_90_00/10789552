The antibiotic susceptibility was analyzed of approximately 400 consecutive isolates of S. pneumoniae isolated from different regions of Saudi Arabia. Most of these isolates were from respiratory (sputum, otitis, 53.8%), blood/CSF (26.3%) and ophthalmic (20%) specimens. Overall 6.2% of the isolates were penicillin-resistant (MICs > or =2 microg/ml) and 51.2% were -intermediate (MICs 0.1-1 microg/ml). The resistance rates to cefuroxime, clarithromycin and ceftriaxone were 14.9%, 14.8% and 4.5% respectively. Only 3.5% of S. pneumoniae showed resistance to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid. The MICs of all tested antibiotics increased as did the penicillin MICs. Penicillin resistance was significantly associated with resistance to cefuroxime (p<0.001) but not with the others. These data indicate the presence of penicillin and multiple-resistant pneumococci in Saudi Arabia and that these strains can spread among individuals. A greater awareness with extended indications for microbiological diagnosis, antimicrobial susceptibility testing and restrictive prescription of antibiotics are needed.
