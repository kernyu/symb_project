Infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) increases the risk of mortality and results in prolonged hospitalization and high utilization of costly treatment modalities. Measures to prevent the spread of MRSA (and possibly VREF) include patient isolation and decontamination, hygiene measures, ward closure, and screening of patients and staff for carriage. In seriously ill patients, the increased use of vancomycin for the treatment of MRSA can lead to the emergence of VREF colonization/infection. Quinupristin/dalfopristin is effective in the treatment of MRSA infections, including nosocomial pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infection, and septicaemia. In the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia, clinical success rates were equivalent between quinupristin/dalfopristin and vancomycin. In the context of a hospital policy which emphasizes effective hygiene measures and the prudent use of antibacterials, quinupristin/dalfopristin is an effective antimicrobial that can help to control the high costs associated with multiresistant MRSA and VREF infections.
