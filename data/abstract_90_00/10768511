From January 1996 to December 1997, we evaluated the in vitro activity of 8 antimicrobials (penicillin, amoxycillin, amoxycillin/clavulanate, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefotaxime, and imipenem) against 350 Streptococcus pneumoniae clinical isolates collected from two hospitals. Imipenem, cefepime and cefotaxime were the most active antibiotics against penicillin-intermediate (PI) and highly penicillin-resistant (PR) S. pneumoniae with MICs 2- to 8-fold lower than penicillin. Against PI and PR pneumococci amoxycillin and amoxycillin/clavulanate were 2-times less active than cefepime and cefotaxime, while cefuroxime was 4-8-times less active. The majority of strains of serotypes 6B, 23F, 14, 9 and 19 were penicillin-resistant, both intermediate (68%) and highly resistant (32%).
