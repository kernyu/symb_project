Mercury chloride toxicity was investigated in two strains of Chlorella and in a strain of Scenedesmus isolated from polluted areas in Tuscany (Italy). No Hg resistance was found in the autotrophic microorganisms isolated, but Scenedesmus sp. strain AR-2489, isolated from the Arno river, was able to grow at concentrations of up to 5 micrograms ml-1 of Hg. This concentration was twice that which inhibited growth of the two Chlorella strains and Scenedesmus acutus 8M, the reference strain from a culture collection. Photosynthesizing cells of Scenedesmus sp. AR-2489 showed reduced Hg uptake, with the highest percentage of Hg removal from the medium. Loss of Hg was not due to Hg(0) volatilization, as shown by a comparison test with the broad-spectrum Hg-resistant Pseudomonas putida FB1. The metabolic differences between Scenedesmus sp. strain AR-2489 and Siacatus strain 8M were: (1) higher growth rate (doubling time of 6.0 h versus 10.6 h); (2) higher O2 production rate (maximum 2 mumol h-1 mg-1 dry weight); and (3) higher intracellular pH during growth. The latter was imaged with a green fluorescence molecular probe (BCEFC-AM) and observed by scanning confocal laser microscopy (SCLM). The distribution of red-autofluorescence chlorophyll-a showed that strain AR-2489 had a rougher and hence more extended specific chloroplast surface than strain 8M. Hg tolerance in strain AR-2489 was related to the rapid increase in dissolved O2 in the medium and in intracellular pH; this caused a loss of soluble mercury transformed to insoluble mercury hydroxide, which is thermodynamically more stable at alkaline pH in highly oxygenated systems.
