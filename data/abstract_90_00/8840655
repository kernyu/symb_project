A marked increase in the incidence of patients of candidaemia is reported from a tertiary care hospital in north India over the last five years (15 patients in 1991 and 275 in 1995). The distribution of Candida species isolated from January 1991 through December 1995 was investigated. Antifungal susceptibility against amphotericin B, 5-fluorocytosine, ketoconazole and fluconazole of 100 randomly selected non-albicans Candida species isolated during 1995 was determined by an in-house standardized disc diffusion method and the standard broth dilution procedure recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS, USA). The disc diffusion method correlated well with NCCLS method except for ketoconazole. Resistance against any antifungal was confirmed only by results of NCCLS method. A shift to higher isolation of non-albicans Candida species was observed during this period (52.6% in 1992 to 89.5% in 1995). Resistance was observed against 5-fluorocytosine in 3 per cent strains of C. krusei; and against fluconazole in 24.2 per cent of C. krusei, 15.4 per cent of C. guilliermondii and 5.7 per cent strains of C. tropicalis. No resistance was detected against amphotericin B and ketoconazole. Thus Candida species with fluconazole resistance have become more prominent in recent years.
