The ERASE Spanish Study Group was founded in 1997 with the primary objective of monitoring both the prevalence and impact of the development of resistance to antiretroviral drugs in HIV-infected sentinel populations. Two major studies, one in 1997 and another in 1998, have been conducted so far. Global data and results derived from substudies are summarized in this presentation.
