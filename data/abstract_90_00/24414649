Some 118 Salmonella strains isolated before and after treatment in stabilization ponds were tested for antimicrobial resistance. In the treatment plant, which decreases the abundance of Salmonella by 99%, a significantly lower level of antibiotic resistance (P<0.01) was identified at the system's inflow point (19%) than at its outflow (29%). The serotypes most frequently identified as having multiple antibiotic resistance were Salmonella paratyphi B and S. typhimurium. High tetracycline resistance was observed at all sampling points, followed by resistance to ampicillin and streptomycin. Antibiotic resistance can be transferred from Salmonella to other members of the Enterobacteriaceae family, such as Escherichia coli K12; transfer frequencies in nutrient broth and filtered sewage water were 4.5x10(-4) and 7x10(-7), respectively.
