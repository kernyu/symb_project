PURPOSE: The aim of this study was the characterization and identification of oral Fusobacterium in patients with and without periodontal disease, and from spittoons and air-water syringes. The antimicrobial susceptibility of this bacterium was evaluated. METHOD: Subgingival samples were taken using sterilized absorbent paper points. Spittoon samples were collected using sterile swabs around the drain area with shut off, and air-water syringe samples by washing the tip with Ringer solution. Samples were transferred in tubes under CO2 flux. Diluted samples were inoculated on to Omata and Disraely agar and blood agar plates, which were incubated in anaerobiosis, at 37 degrees C, for 4 days. Bacterial species were identified biochemically. MIC was determined using an agar dilution method. RESULTS: Periodontal patients, healthy subjects, spittoons and air-water syringes were 80%, 67.6%, 37.8% and 3.3% positive to Fusobacterium, respectively. Clindamycin, imipenem, lincomycin, metronidazole and tetracycline were active against all human and environmental isolates. Eighteen isolates resistant to ampicillin or penicillin G produced beta-lactamases. The presence of human oral bacteria in items of dental equipment supports the hypothesis that such equipment may serve as a vehicle for the transmission of pathogenic organisms. CONCLUSION: Pieces of dental equipment may serve as a vehicle for the transmission of oral pathogenic organisms.
