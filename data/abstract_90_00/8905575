The in vitro activities of 14 anti-microbial agents were determined against 92 strains of E. coli isolated from lambs (60 strains) and kids (32 strains) affected by neonatal diarrhoea. The overall percentage of resistant strains to streptomycin, sulphadimethoxine and tetracycline was very high (above 70%). A high level of resistance (from 30% to 50%) to ampicillin, kanamycin, neomycin and chloramphenicol was also detected. The E. coli strains were highly susceptible to cephalosporins, polymyxin and quinolones. Most of the strains showed multiresistance: 77.2% of isolates were resistant to at least two antibiotics, 55.4% were resistant to at least four antibiotics and 33.7% were resistant to at least six antibiotics. A total of 34 antibiotypes could be distinguished.
