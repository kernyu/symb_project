Vibrio salmonicida is the causative agent of cold-water vibriosis in farmed Atlantic salmon. We cloned a 6.9-kb PstI fragment from the 170-MDa plasmid (pRVS1) containing a tetracycline resistance determinant. A subcloned 1.96-kb HindIII fragment was found to mediate the tetracycline resistance. The 2.5-kb ClaI-PvuI fragment carrying the Tet E determinant from Escherichia coli hybridized under stringent conditions with the cloned 1.96-kb HindIII fragment from V. salmonicida. The 1.96-kb HindIII fragment codes for a protein of 26.5 kDa which represents a candidate for the structural TetA protein of the class E determinant. Deletion of a 0.28-kb BalI fragment from the middle of the HindIII fragment resulted in the loss of tetracycline resistance. We were able to show that when E. coli carries the cloned 6.9-kb PstI fragment, expression of tetracycline resistance is regulated by the concentration of tetracycline in the medium. In contrast, tetracycline resistance was constitutively expressed in the E. coli isolate carrying the 1.96-kb HindIII fragment. The tetracycline resistance gene isolated from the 170-MDa R plasmid of the marine fish pathogen V. salmonicida was characterized and shown to be a class E determinant.
