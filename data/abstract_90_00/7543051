The immunosuppressive macrolide, rapamycin, impedes the G1 to S cell cycle progression in cytokine-stimulated normal lymphocytes and in certain autonomously proliferating cell lines. Here, we found that the rapamycin-induced growth arrest augments homotypic aggregation in the YAC-1 T cell lymphoma. The growth arrest and increased aggregation were both blocked by the rapamycin antagonist, L-685,818, which interacts with the intracellular binding proteins mediating rapamycin's biochemical action. Moreover, rapamycin-induced aggregation was not seen in YAC-1 cells mutants selected for resistance to the drug's antiproliferative effect. Although the inhibition of G1/S progression induced by serum deprivation also resulted in increased cellular aggregation, cell cycle blockade in late G1 by mimosine, early S phase by hydroxyurea, or G2/M by nocodazole all failed to do so. Furthermore, the aggregation induced by rapamycin was blocked by antibodies to the alpha (CD11a) or beta (CD18) subunits of the integrin, LFA-1, or to its ligands, ICAM-1 and ICAM-2, and did not occur in LFA-1-deficient YAC mutants. However, the surface expression of LFA-1, ICAM-1, or ICAM-2 was not augmented in cells aggregated by rapamycin. Finally, the serine/threonine protein phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, was found to abrogate rapamycin-induced aggregation. Therefore, rapamycin's impairment of YAC-1 cell growth in G1 is accompanied by enhanced LFA-1-mediated homotypic cell adhesion that may reflect an increase of the integrin's avidity for its ligands and may involve protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events. This suggests the existence of a link between cell cycle progression and "inside-out" LFA-1 signaling, possibly regulated by rapamycin's biochemical targets.
