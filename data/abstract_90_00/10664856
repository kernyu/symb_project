The fosfomycin resistance gene, fosC, has been cloned from the fosfomycin-producing organism, Pseudomonas syringae PB-5123. Sequence analysis upstream of this gene found a new ORF showing significant homology to 2-hydroxypropylphosphonic acid epoxidase from fosfomycin-producing Streptomyces wedmorensis. The purified recombinant protein of this ORF converted 2-hydroxypropylphosphonic acid to fosfomycin. This result clearly showed the ORF to encode 2-hydroxypropylphosphonic acid epoxidase in PB-5123.
