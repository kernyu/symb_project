Macrophages, widely distributed in the body, play a central role in mediating host defense against herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections. Both intrinsic antiviral activities of macrophages (phagocytic and degradative function leading to presentation of viral antigens, inhibition of viral replication) and extrinsic antiviral resistance (inhibition of the spread of HSV, inhibition of HSV replication in permissive cells and selecting lysing of HSV-infected cells) are modulated by cytokines such as interferons (IFN) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Macrophages in the presence of an interactive network of cytokines are involved in the orchestration of non specific host defense and specific immune responses against HSV infections. Further investigations of physiopathology and complex interactions of macrophages-HSV should lead to the development of immunotherapy for HSV infections in immunocompromised individuals.
