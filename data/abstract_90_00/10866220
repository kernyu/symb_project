The nikO gene encoding a putative enolpyruvyl transferase has been identified within the Streptomyces tendae Tu901/8c nikkomycin gene cluster. nikO encodes a deduced protein of 471 amino acid residues which exhibits significant sequence similarity to UDP-N-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase and 5-enol-pyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate synthase from various origin. The nikO gene was inactivated by inserting a kanamycin resistance cassette; the mutant did not produce biologically active nikkomycins I, J, X, and Z nor the nucleoside moieties, nikkomycins C(x) and C(z), but accumulated the novel component RT 2.0. RT 2.0 has been isolated from culture filtrate and its structure was determined by using mass spectrometry and NMR analyses as ribofuranosyl-4-formyl-4-imidazolone which represents a novel nucleoside. The putative activity of the nikO gene product in nikkomycin biosynthesis will be discussed.
