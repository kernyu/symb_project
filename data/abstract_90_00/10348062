Sinusitis is a prevalent and costly disease that affects >14% of the population and accounts for >$2 billion in yearly healthcare costs. It is one of the most common conditions treated by primary care physicians. The multiple host and environmental factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease and the lack of clear guidelines for diagnosis and treatment pose a challenge to effective management of the problem. The diagnosis of uncomplicated cases rests mainly on the history and clinical examination; attempts have been made to identify the most useful clinical predictors of acute bacterial sinusitis. Microbiologic and imaging studies are rarely performed during the initial assessment and are usually reserved for recurrent or refractory disease. Treatment involves drainage of the congested sinuses and elimination of pathogenic organisms. Although antimicrobial therapy hastens the resolution of symptoms of acute sinusitis, the need for antimicrobial therapy remains questionable, and its judicious use is challenged by the increase in antibiotic-resistant Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, the organisms most commonly implicated in acute sinusitis. A lack of resolution or frequent recurrence of sinusitis warrants evaluation by a specialist.
