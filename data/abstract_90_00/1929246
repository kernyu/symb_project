beta-Lactamase-producing (BL+), aminoglycoside-resistant (AR) Enterococcus faecalis is endemic in our hospital, having caused widespread colonization and infection. Suitable therapy for infections caused by these organisms has been problematic. We compared the antimicrobial and bactericidal activities, by broth macrodilution and time-kill methods, of several antibiotics, alone and in combination, against BL+, AR isolates of E. faecalis and determined the transmissibility of antibiotic resistance markers. Ampicillin-sulbactam, imipenem, daptomycin, and ciprofloxacin were the most active antibiotics with MICs for 90% of isolates tested of 2, 1, 2, and 1 microgram/ml, respectively, against inocula of 10(3) and 10(5) CFU/ml. Little inoculum effect was noted with imipenem, vancomycin, daptomycin, or ciprofloxacin, while the addition of sulbactam to ampicillin partially inhibited the effect of the increased inoculum. Penicillin-sulbactam and ampicillin-sulbactam combinations in a 2:1 ratio were most frequently bactericidal (greater than or equal to 3-log10-unit decrease in bacterial titers at 24 h for 13 of 20 isolates), followed by daptomycin (8 of 20 isolates) and ciprofloxacin (2 of 20 isolates). Bactericidal activity was not demonstrated for imipenem or teicoplanin. beta-Lactamase production and aminoglycoside resistance were associated with a 60- to 65-MDa plasmid which was easily transferred to a plasmid-free E. faecalis recipient. The 840-bp beta-lactamase gene probe hybridized to purified plasmid DNA from BL+ donor isolates of E. faecalis and transconjugants but not from BL- isolates. Ampicillin-sulbactam and daptomycin (an investigational antibiotic) seem to be reasonable choices for the empiric therapy of presumed enterococcal infections in hospitals in which BL+, AR E. faecalis strains are isolated. Their use should ideally be supported by tests for bactericidal activity.
