The effect of plasmid pKM101 on the survival of Escherichia coli AB1157, growing in minimal medium, in the presence of a 4-quinolone DNA gyrase inhibitor was investigated. The presence of this plasmid decreased susceptibility to the quinolone ciprofloxacin, whereas mucAB genes present in a multicopy plasmid did not. The same effect of pKM101 was detected in a recA430 mutant, confirming that it was not really related to the SOS response. In contrast, when survival assays were performed under amino acid starvation conditions, pKM101 did not confer protection against ciprofloxacin. All of these results indicated that the synthesis of a product(s), different from MucAB, which was encoded by the plasmid pKM101 increased the rate of survival of the AB1157 strain in the presence of quinolone. To identify the gene(s) responsible for this phenotype, several plasmid derivatives carrying different portions of pKM101 were constructed. The 2.2-kb region containing korB, traL, korA, and traM genes was sufficient to decrease susceptibility to quinolone. This plasmidic fragment also made the AB1157 host strain grow more slowly (the Slo phenotype). Moreover, the suppression of the Slo phenotype by addition of adenine to the cultures abolished the decreased susceptibility to quinolone. These results are evidence that the protection against quinolone conferred by this region of pKM101 in strain AB1157 is a direct consequence of the slow growth rate.
