In order to identify the alternative effective chemotherapeutic agents for murine babesiosis, some selected drugs were examined for their efficacy against protozoan infection in the mouse-Babesia rodhaini (B. rodhaini) model. Clindamycin was not completely effective for elimination of parasites in a dose of 50 mg or 100 mg/kg BW/day b.i.d. but effective to prolong the life span of hosts, while it completely cured B. rodhaini infections in a dose of 200 mg. On the other hand, a double therapy consisting of 2 treatments with 100 mg clindamycin and 100 mg clindamycin and with 100 mg clindamycin and 100 mg tetracycline; respectively, and a single therapy with 100 mg tetracycline or 200 mg clindamycin, had a possibility to clear away B. rodhaini organisms from hosts. However, almost all the treatment groups, had a relapse of the infection within 10 days post treatment or re-treatment. Cured mice by treatment with clindamycin and clindamycin, or clindamycin and tetracycline showed complete resistance against challenge with B. rodhaini, while mice cured by administration of clindamycin at 200 mg or tetracycline at 100 mg showed incomplete resistance to challenge infection. The present data suggest that the two former chemotherapies can induce effective protective immunity (premunization), but the latter two chemotherapies induce incomplete premunization.
