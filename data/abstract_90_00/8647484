Aim of our study was making easier choice of right antibiotic to treatment newborns with sepsis after receiving results of bacteriological test. We analysed antibiograms that were results of first bacteriological test of blood samples taken from 59 neonates, who were admitted in first week of life to the Neonatal Pathology Clinic in Zabrze. On the ground of our analysis we propose applying netilmicin and cephalotin in every case of neonate with symptoms suggesting the sepsis. These two antibiotics have the best effects in treatment the sepsis.
