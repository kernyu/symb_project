The nucleotide sequence of the gene specifying the ethidium efflux system of Escherichia coli has been determined. The translated open reading frame has identified a membrane-bound polypeptide of 110 amino acids (11,960 Da) which shares 42% identity with a staphylococcal protein specifying resistance to ethidium.
