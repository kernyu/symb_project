The effects of sodium salicylate and sodium tauro-24,25-dihydrofusidate (STDHF) on the aqueous permeability of confluent monolayers of Caco-2 cells were studied. Measurements of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) showed a concentration-dependent effect of both compounds after apical incubation for 1 hr. Reductions in TEER resulting from EC50 concentrations (2.8 mM for STDHF; 173 mM for salicylate) were reversible within 5.75 hr. The transpithelial fluxes of two hydrophilic model compounds, sodium fluorescein F (molecular weight 376) and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextran (mean molecular weight 4000) was significantly increased by STDHF (2.8 mM). Sodium salicylate (173 mM) only enhanced the transport of sodium fluorescein significantly. At the EC50 concentrations, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) visualized both fluorescent tracers mainly in the paracellular route. With higher enhancer concentrations (373 mM sodium salicylate and 8 mM STDHF), both transport markers appeared intracellularly as a result of cell death. STDHF rapidly extracted an exogenous lipophilic membrane probe, 5-(N-hexadecanoyl)aminofluorescein (HEDAF), from the apical part of Caco-2 plasma membranes, indicating qualitatively that STDHF interacts with the lipid portion of cell membranes. These results suggest that both sodium salicylate and STDHF can be used to reversibly increase paracellular permeability of Caco-2 cell monolayers, whereby STDHF appears to be advantageous compared to sodium salicylate. By adapting the Costar cell culture system to CLSM, we have shown that this technique is suitable to study membrane interactions qualitatively and for visualizing transport routes of hydrophilic tracers through nonfixed, filter-grown monolayers.
