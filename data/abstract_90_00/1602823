Several laboratories have shown that AZT-resistant variants of HIV-1 can be isolated from patients who have received prolonged therapy with this drug. Our laboratory has now been able to generate HIV-1 variants resistant to both AZT and ddI, in tissue culture, by using step-wise increases in the concentrations of each of these compounds over a 10-week period. This work has been performed by culturing wild-type clinical strains of HIV-1 as well as the HIV-3b laboratory strain of this virus under such conditions. The ID50 values obtained for the resistant viruses thus generated vary between 50-100 times above those of the parental wild-type strains in each case. Furthermore, we have identified several new mutation sites in the HIV-1 pol gene that are responsible for the observed resistance to AZT and ddI. We have not succeeded, however, in generating drug-resistant strains of HIV-1, under conditions in which several compounds or anti-viral agents were simultaneously present during the in vitro selection process. Combinations of drugs which failed to yield drug-resistant variants included AZT plus ddI, AZT plus alpha-interferon, and ddI plus alpha-interferon. These findings indicate that HIV drug resistance is less likely to occur in tissue culture when combinations of drugs are used, and provide rationale for the development of combination clinical trials for treatment of HIV-associated disease.
