Pharmacokinetic parameters of third generation cephalosporins vary widely, requiring different dosage regimens and adjustment methods for each agent. Although their antibacterial spectrum favours their usage in infections caused by aerobic Gram-negative organisms, due to their limited post-antibiotic effect against these organisms, dosage regimens should ensure that free drug concentrations at the site of infection remain above the minimum inhibitory concentration for as much of the dosage interval as possible in patients with normal host defence mechanisms and for the entire dosage interval in immunocompromised patients. Altered protein binding encountered in various disease states can affect both microbiological and pharmacokinetic properties especially for drugs with high protein binding. Since the concentrations at the site of action are often different from those in serum, a higher or lower range of dosages needs to be selected depending on the target site. Decreased renal function affects the elimination of most third generation cephalosporins, whereas the presence of hepatic disease does not generally necessitate dosage adjustment. Because of the complex age-related physiological changes in paediatric and elderly patients, dosage should be adjusted on the basis of the reported pharmacokinetic data in these populations. The usual recommended dose may or may not be optimal in a given condition depending on the complex interactions between pharmacokinetic, microbiological and other host factors.
