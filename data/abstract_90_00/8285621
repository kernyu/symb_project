Fluorescence measurements and polymerase chain reaction amplification of streptomycete 16S ribosomal DNA sequences were used to show that a number of antibiotic preparations employed for human and animal use are contaminated with chromosomal DNA of the antibiotic-producing organism. The DNA contains identifiable antibiotic resistance gene sequences; the uptake of this DNA by bacteria and its functional incorporation into bacterial replicons would lead to the generation of antibiotic resistance determinants. We propose that the presence of DNA encoding drug resistance in antibiotic preparations has been a factor in the rapid development of multiple antibiotic resistance in bacteria.
