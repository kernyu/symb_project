Rts1 is a multiphenotype drug resistance factor, and one of its phenotypes is temperature-sensitive growth (Tsg) of host bacteria. A 3.65-kb fragment from Rts1 DNA was shown to cause the Tsg phenotype in host cells. This tsg fragment was split by a restriction enzyme, HincII, into four fragments. Two of these fragments were called HincII-S (short) and HincII-L (long), respectively. Each of these two fragments conferred the Tsg phenotype, indicating that, in fact, these two independent regions were responsible for the Tsg phenotype. The HincII-S 783-bp and HincII-L 1,479-bp fragments were sequenced. The region in the HincII-S fragment to which the Tsg phenotype was attributed was narrowed to a 146-bp (nucleotides 1 to 146) fragment by various restriction enzyme digestions. Further digestion of the 146-bp fragment with Bal 31 suggested that the 116-bp (nucleotides 9 to 124) fragment is the minimum sequence required for Tsg. On the other hand, in the HincII-L fragment, a fragment of 249 bp (nucleotides 1210 to 1458) and a fragment of 321 bp (nucleotides 1942 to 2262) contained separate temperature-sensitive growth activity. None of three tsg fragments contained open reading frames. The 249-bp fragment had very weak Tsg activity, while the 321-bp fragment had no Tsg activity. On the other hand, when these two fragments were together in the pUC19 vector, they exhibited very strong Tsg activity equivalent to that of the original 1,479-bp fragment. In addition, two of the 249-bp fragments gave similar, strong Tsg activity. The HincII-L 1,479-bp fragment contained an open reading frame for kanamycin resistance which was found between nucleotides 1423 and 2238. This kanamycin resistance gene sequence was different from that of the reported kanamycin resistance gene of Tn903 at 12 positions which were deduced to change seven amino acids.
