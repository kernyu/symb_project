The bactericidal activities of monotherapy with trovafloxacin (-0.37 +/- 0.15 Delta log(10) CFU/ml. h), vancomycin (-0.32 +/- 0.12 Delta log(10) CFU/ml. h), and ceftriaxone (-0.36 +/- 0.19 Delta log(10) CFU/ml. h) for the treatment of experimental meningitis in rabbits due to a clinical penicillin-resistant pneumococcal strain (MIC, 4 mg/liter) were similar. The combination of ceftriaxone with trovafloxacin considerably improved the killing rates (-0.67 +/- 0.16 Delta log(10) CFU/ml. h) and was slightly superior to ceftriaxone with vancomycin (killing rate, -0.53 +/- 0. 22 Delta log(10) CFU/ml. h), the regimen most commonly used in clinical practice. In vitro, synergy was demonstrated between ceftriaxone and trovafloxacin by the checkerboard method (fractional inhibitory concentration index, 0.5) and by time-killing assays over 8 h.
