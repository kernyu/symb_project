In the past 4 years, interest in drug-resistant herpesviruses has evolved from the realm of academic laboratory studies to that of great clinical importance. Recurrent and persistent infections due to the herpes simplex viruses, varicella-zoster virus, and human cytomegalovirus have been an unwelcome consequence of immunosuppression in graft recipients, cancer patients, and those suffering from AIDS. Treatment of these infections with the available antiviral drugs, such as acyclovir, ganciclovir, and foscarnet, has resulted in both clinical benefit and the emergence of drug-resistant variants. In addition, the role of Epstein-Barr virus is being clarified for an array of disease syndromes, and therapeutic approaches are beginning to emerge. In the present review, the emergence and clinical importance of drug resistance among the herpesviruses have been explored. Furthermore, particular attention has been focused on our understanding of the mechanisms of drug resistance and how that understanding will guide us in the development of more effective antiviral drugs and drug usage.
