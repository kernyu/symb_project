One hundred and three strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolated from a periurban STD clinic in The Gambia were studied for antimicrobial susceptibility, plasmid profile, and serogroup using standard procedures. Seventy-nine (77%) were penicillinase producers (PPNG) and fully resistant to penicillin (MIC > or = 8 mg/l). One isolate showed chromosomally induced resistance to penicillin (MIC 2 mg/l). None of the isolates was sensitive to tetracycline; 16 (16%) showed intermediate resistance (MICs 1-8 mg/l) and 87 (84%) showed high-level plasmid-mediated resistance (TRNG) (MICs > 10 mg/l). This is the first report of TRNG in The Gambia. Only 6 (6%) strains were fully sensitive to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (MIC < 8 mg/l); 78 (76%) showed intermediate level resistance (MICs 8-16 mg/l) and 19 (18%) were fully resistant (MIC > 32 mg/l). Indications of an increase in MIC to ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone were found in 6 (6%) and 1 (1%) strains, respectively, although all remained fully sensitive (MICs 0.004-0.03 mg/l and 0.001-0.015 mg/l). All PPNG and TRNG strains carried the 3.2 MDa and 25.2 MDa plasmids, respectively. All isolates carried the 2.6 MDa cryptic plasmid and 9 (3 PPNG and 6 non-PPNG) carried the 24.5 MDa conjugative plasmid. Forty-four (43%) strains were typed group W1, 58 (56%) W11/111 and 1 had cross-reacting antigens. Because PPNG are frequently encountered and high-level TRNG is now prevalent, the newer cephalosporins and quinolones must now be considered as first-line drugs for the treatment of gonorrhoea in The Gambia.
