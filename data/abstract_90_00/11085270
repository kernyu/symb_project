The kinesin-related Cin8p and cytoplasmic dynein are microtubule-associated motor proteins required for anaphase spindle elongation in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Cells deleted for DYN1 (the gene encoding the dynein heavy chain) and carrying the temperature-sensitive allele cin8-3 cannot grow at temperatures above 35 degrees C. Here, we report that the temperature sensitivity of haploid cin8-3 dyn1delta cells is suppressed by the simultaneous presence of the loci MATa and MATalpha, which contain the regulatory genes that determine mating-type and ploidy-dependent phenotypes. The presence of the two MAT loci also rendered haploid cells more resistant to the antimicrotubule drug benomyl. Our results suggest that, in preparation for handling double the amount of DNA in mitosis, properties of microtubules in diploid cells are modified in a pathway controlled by the mating-type regulatory genes.
