In this paper, the first robust experimental evidence of in vitro and in vivo concentration-dependent selection of low-level antibiotic-resistant genetic variants is described. The work is based on the study of an asymmetric competition assay with pairs of isogenic Escherichia coli strains, differing only (apart from a neutral chromosomal marker) in a single amino acid replacement in a plasmid-mediated TEM-1 beta-lactamase enzyme, which results in the new TEM-12 beta-lactamase. The mixture was challenged by different antibiotic concentrations, both in vitro and in the animal model, and the selective process of the variant population was carefully monitored. A mathematical model was constructed to test the hypothesis that measured growth and killing rates of the individual TEM variants at different antibiotic concentrations could be used to predict quantitatively the strength of selection for TEM-12 observed in competition experiments at these different concentrations.
