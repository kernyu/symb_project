The postantibiotic effect (PAE) and postantibiotic sub-MIC effect (PAE-SME) of sanfetrinem were compared to those of penicillin G, amoxicillin, cefpodoxime, ceftriaxone, imipenem, and clarithromycin against four penicillin-susceptible, four intermediately susceptible, and four resistant pneumococci. The MICs of imipenem were the lowest against all of the strains (0.03 to 0.5 microg/ml), followed by those of sanfetrinem (0.016 to 1.0 microg/ml), amoxicillin and ceftriaxone (0.016 to 2.0 microg/ml), and cefpodoxime (0.03 to 8.0 microg/ml). High-level resistance to clarithromycin (MIC, >64.0 microg/ml) was seen in three selected strains. The PAEs of all of the oral beta-lactams tested were similar for all of the strains, ranging from 1 to 6.5 h. The PAEs of ceftriaxone and imipenem ranged from 1 to 8 h, and those of clarithromycin ranged from 1 to 7 h. The mean PAEs of all of the beta-lactams and clarithromycin were 2.8 to 4.3 and 2.5 h, respectively. PAE-SMEs could not be determined for all of the strains due to complete killing, especially at high subinhibitory concentrations. However, the overall pattern with all of the compounds tested was that PAE-SMEs were longer than PAEs. Measurable PAE-SMEs of sanfetrinem at the three subinhibitory concentrations (0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 times the MIC) were 2 to 7, 2 to 7, and 3 to 6 h, while those of amoxicillin and cefpodoxime were 1 to 7.5, 2 to 4, and 4 to 9 and 2 to 7, 4 to 7, and 4 to 6 h, respectively. Measurable PAE-SMEs of ceftriaxone and imipenem were 1 to 6.5, 2 to 9, and 2 to 9 and 1.5 to 6, 2 to 5.8, and 4 to 7.7 h, respectively. Measurable clarithromycin PAE-SMEs were 1 to 5, 1 to 5, and 1 to 6 h at the three concentrations.
