A variant obtained by a single passage of the initial FPV in the presence of 25 micrograms/ml rimantadine is more resistant to the drug than the parental virus. Sensitivity to rimantadine is higher in a variant obtained similarly by cell culture infection with rimantadine-resistant FPV. Potentiation of the antiviral effect of a combination of ribavirin (12-25 micrograms/ml) and rimantadine (0.1-6 micrograms/ml) is decreased or null if rimantadine dose is increased to 12-25 micrograms/ml; this phenomenon does not depend on the sensitivity of infective virus to rimantadine. Antiviral effect of drug combination with a high concentration of rimantadine is due to ribavirin alone.
