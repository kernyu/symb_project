Ivermectin resistance in the nematode Haemonchus contortus has been reported in many parts of the world and many ivermectin resistant isolates have been found to have reduced sensitivity to moxidectin. However, it is unclear whether parasites that are selected with moxidectin would demonstrate reduced sensitivity to ivermectin. In this study, the effects of moxidectin and ivermectin on an unselected strain and a strain of H. contortus derived from the unselected strain but selected over 14 generations with moxidectin, were compared in jirds. The recovery of adult worms and fourth stage (L4) larvae following treatment were compared between strains and anthelmintics. Moxidectin-selected H. contortus showed reduced sensitivity to ivermectin as well as to moxidectin. Doses of 0.1 mg/kg of moxidectin and 0.4 mg/kg of ivermectin were necessary to obtain an efficacy of 95% or above against the moxidectin-selected strain of H. contortus compared with 0.025 mg/kg for moxidectin and 0.1 mg/kg for ivermectin required for a similar efficacy in the unselected strain.
