Epistatic interactions between unlinked transgene loci in tobacco plants were studied following sexual crosses between different transgenic lines. Three potential "modifier" transgene loci, which were structurally similar but integrated at different chromosomal locations, were tested for their ability to influence the expression of a partially homologous "target" transgene locus. After introduction of an individual modifier locus, the target locus could be either unaffected, completely inactivated and methylated or differentially sensitive, showing more complete inactivation and methylation when homozygous than when hemizygous. The implications of these results for inbreeding depression in plants are discussed.
