The development of the burn disease with infection as the most important complication represents still a major problem in burn patients. With the introduction of the method of early surgical excision of the Af1p4r with immediate grafting in major burns, improved survival has been achieved, particularly in children. However, especially in adults, early massive excisions did not prove to be of much benefit for survival. In these cases, more-or-less sequential staged excisional procedures have been introduced by many renown burn surgeons. In 1976 Monafo et al. presented the cerium nitrate-silver sulphadiazine cream (CSD) combination for topical therapy. The addition of 2.2% of the rare earth metal cerium salt to silversulphadiazine causes the formation of a relatively hard, yellow, leather-like eschar with excellent resistance to infection and good long-term adherence to the burn wound. This allows the surgeon to perform late tangential excision and immediate autografting thus decreasing the open wound size and the rate of severe infections originating in the burn wound itself. We report our experience with the treatment of 20 patients with deep burns exceeding 20% of the BSA with cerium nitrate-silver sulphadiazine cream compared with a similar group of burn patients treated by silver sulphadiazine cream alone. CSD proved to be safe and effective in the treatment of deep and extensive burns. Its advantages include easy and painless application and removal, turning the necrotic skin to yellow, and a leathery crust with good resistance to infection, thus enabling later, or staged, sequential excisions in cases where early massive excisions are not possible.
