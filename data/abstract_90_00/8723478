A total of 234 clinical isolates of Aeromonas, primarily A. hydrophila, were collected for the present study. Most were isolates from blood. By the agar dilution method, more than 90% of the Aeromonas strains were found to be susceptible to moxalactam, ceftazidime, cefepime, aztreonam, imipenem, amikacin, and fluoroquinolones, but they were more resistant to tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, some extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and aminoglycosides than strains from the United States and Australia.
