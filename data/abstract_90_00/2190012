Crede's method was evaluated using of ofloxacin (OFLX) and gentamicin (GM) to show the clinical significance of chemoprophylaxis against ophthalmia neonatorum occurring through vertical infection. The obtained results are summarized as follows. 1. OFLX and GM were separately instilled using Crede's original method to 260 cases selected from all the cases of delivery encountered in this hospital during a period of 6 months from 1987 to 1988. Both groups had similar backgrounds. 2. OFLX and GM were effective in 123 of 129 cases and in 116 of 131 cases, respectively. No side effects were found. 3. OFLX to which recent isolates of Staphylococci and Escherichia coli from obstetric clinics were sensitive was more effective for the prevention than GM to which many isolates were tolerant. These findings indirectly proved the clinical significance of Crede's method. 4. Cases showing ineffectiveness of the prophylaxis may have been due to nosocomial infections.
