The ability to produce IFN-gamma during an erythrocytic infection with P. chabaudi chabaudi is not an indicator of resistance or susceptibility of mice to this infection. However, IFN-gamma may play a transient role in immune control of the parasite. We have shown that after its removal in vivo by antibody treatment the acute phase of infection is clearly exacerbated. After the acute phase of infection the T cell response changes from one characterized by IFN-gamma production to one of a T helper response for antibody production. The IFN-gamma response to parasite challenge can be recovered if the challenge infection is given many weeks after the mice have cleared their primary parasitaemias. These data suggest that the CD4+ T cell response is a heterogenous one and regulated by its cytokine production. The protective mechanisms therefore probably reflect the nature of the ongoing immune response.
