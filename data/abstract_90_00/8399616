The authors have evaluated the pharmacokinetics of four antifungal agents used in the therapy of fungal peritonitis. Amphotericin B (Amph B) poorly diffuses from blood into peritoneal fluid, which intraperitoneal administration induces severe abdominal pain. 5-Fluorocytosine (5FC) easily crosses peritoneum, but resistance may appear when the drug is used alone. Ketoconazole (K) poorly penetrates into peritoneal fluid, while Fluconazole (F), used per os or intraperitoneally, shows a good antifungal activity both in serum and in the peritoneal fluid. In conclusion, from a pharmacokinetic point of view, all the antifungal agents examined, perhaps with the exception of F, do not offer, when used alone, sufficient guarantees in curing peritonitis. Therefore, for treating fungal infections in CAPD, drug combinations such as AmphB + 5FC, K + 5FC or 5FC+F have to be used.
