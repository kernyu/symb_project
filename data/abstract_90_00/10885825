The interaction between microbial resistance and antibacterial agents occurs in a direct and an indirect fashion. Directly--through the development of resistance to the agent used, or to agents of the same class--as exemplified by the induction of beta-lactamase by both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. It also takes place through the development of resistance to compounds of different classes to the compound used, as exemplified by the loss of Streptococcus pneumoniae susceptibility to penicillin that is accompanied by a parallel loss of sensitivity to erythromycin and to tetracycline. As for the indirect way--microbial resistance may develop through selection of resistant organisms when the patient is treated with antibiotics, when the environment is contaminated with antibiotics (hospital) or when antibacterial agents are used in agriculture and animal husbandry.
