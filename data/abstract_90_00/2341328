Resistance to 14 antibiotics was tested in 270 Salmonella strains isolated from different aquatic environments. All the strains were sensitive to nalidixic acid (30 micrograms) and cephalothin (30 micrograms) but more than 90% were resistant to tetracycline (30 micrograms). The percentage of strains resistant to other antimicrobial substances depended on the antibiotic and on the isolation source. Twenty-four resistance patterns were recorded in strains isolated from three environmental sources. The only multi-resistance detected in the three ecosystems was that of sulphadiazine and tetracycline (about 20%). The serotypes most frequently detected with multi-resistance to different antibiotics were Salmonella typhimurium and Salm. blockley.
