Traditional antiviral susceptibility testing methods using cell lines can be applied to no more than about 30% of clinical HIV isolates (Larder et al., 1989a; Fenyo et al., 1989). We tested the cell-free supernatant from low passage clinical HIV isolates using donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Drug susceptibility was assessed by measuring the effect of increasing zidovudine (ZDV) concentrations on HIV P24 antigen production. Susceptibility results were obtained on 24/27 consecutive clinical isolates and 6/6 laboratory isolates. The mean IC90 of isolates from untreated patients was 0.008 microM ZDV (range: 0.002-0.038). The IC90s of isolates from ZDV-treated patients ranged from 0.007 to greater than 10 microM ZDV. All isolates with an IC90 < 0.1 microM ZDV had a wild type sequence at codon 215 of the HIV pol gene; 11/12 isolates with an IC90 > 0.1 microM ZDV had a mutation at codon 215 (P < 0.001). Among 16 ZDV-treated patients, there was a modest correlation between the change in CD4 count from the start of ZDV treatment and the IC90 of the patient's isolate following treatment (r = 0.51). Susceptibility testing using donor PBMC can be a sensitive means of testing a broad range of clinical HIV isolates.
