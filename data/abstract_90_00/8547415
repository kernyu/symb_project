A cohort of 650 prostitutes from Kinshasa, Zaire, was followed at monthly intervals for sexually transmitted diseases as part of an HIV intervention project. Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates, obtained during a period of 30 months, were auxotyped, serotyped and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. Among 1085 gonococcal isolates tested, 725 (67%) produced beta-lactamase (PPNG) and 323 (30%) showed plasmid-mediated resistance to tetracyline (TRNG). Over time, the prevalence of PPNG varied between 60 and 73%, while the level of TRNG increased from 11 to 45%.
