160 ovine isolates of Pasteurella haemolytica, representing each of the 16 serotypes and also untypable strains, were examined for plasmid content. Plasmid DNA was identified in, and prepared from, strains of serotypes A2, T3, A14 and A16 and also from an untypable strain. The relationship between the plasmids present in the different strains was examined both by restriction fragment profile analysis and by DNA/DNA hybridisation. Both methods gave broadly similar results and showed that each serotype tended to contain either a single plasmid species, or a limited range of species, and that structural similarities could traverse serotype boundaries. None of the plasmid-bearing strains showed any significant level of resistance to a range of antibiotics.
