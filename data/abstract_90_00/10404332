This in-vitro study was designed to compare the activity of levofloxacin with that of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, erythromycin, penicillin, amoxycillin, loracarbef, cefaclor, cefpodoxime, ceftriaxone, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, clindamycin and vancomycin against a collection of 202 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (56% susceptible to penicillin, 34% intermediate, 10% resistant). The isolates (60% nasopharyngeal, 40% middle ear) were obtained from otherwise healthy children at child care centres in urban and rural Nebraska, and at a paediatric clinic in rural Kentucky. MICs were determined by NCCLS agar dilution methodology using an inoculum of 10(4) cfu/spot. Using NCCLS breakpoints, the percentage of penicillin-intermediate and -resistant strains susceptible to the evaluable agents were, respectively, as follows: levofloxacin (99%, 100%), ofloxacin (87%, 100%), erythromycin (52%, 65%), ceftriaxone (93%, 25%), trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (7%, 0%), clindamycin (93%, 100%) and vancomycin (100%, 100%). Without NCCLS interpretive criteria, no conclusions could be made concerning the susceptibility of penicillin-intermediate and -resistant strains to the other study drugs. All beta-lactam antibiotics, erythromycin and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole were less active against penicillin-resistant strains, indicating that these may be suboptimal agents for empirical therapy for suspected S. pneumoniae infections in these patient populations. However, levofloxacin, ofloxacin, clindamycin and vancomycin were equally active against penicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains. These data suggest that the efficacy of levofloxacin should be examined in both adult and paediatric S. pneumoniae infections involving body sites where levofloxacin concentrations > 2 mg/L can be achieved safely.
