Twenty isolates of Escherichia coli from poultry, predominantly from birds with colibacillosis, were collected and plasmid profile analysis, antibiogram testing, resistotyping and biotyping were compared as epidemiological tools for the differentiation and identification of the isolates. Plasmid profile analysis, in conjunction with any one of the other three tests, was found to be more valuable as an epidemiological tool than one test alone.
