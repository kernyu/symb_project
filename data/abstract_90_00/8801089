The first case of early-onset postsplenectomy arthritis due to intermediately penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae is reported. After initial parenteral vancomycin and rifampin followed by oral prystinamycin-rifampin, the patient recovered without any sequelae. This case should increase awareness of the risk of invasive disease caused by penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae in the early postoperative period after splenectomy.
