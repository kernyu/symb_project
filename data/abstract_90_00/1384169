Cell surface gangliosides in human melanoma cell lines were modulated by pretreatment and adaptation to 6-thioguanine and 5-bromo-deoxyuridine. Chemo- and radiation sensitivities were compared in original cell lines and modulated cells by the human tumor colony-forming assay. Modulated cells showed decreased expression of cell surface GM2 and GD2 gangliosides. This reduction was correlated with increased resistance to bleomycin, vincristine, cisplatin and radiation treatment. These results suggest that cell surface GM2 and GD2 ganglioside expression in human melanoma cells is intimately associated with several cellular biological properties, such as drug or radiation sensitivity and cellular differentiation.
