BACKGROUND: Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of the hyperdynamic circulation observed in portal hypertensive states. Interferon (IFN)-alpha can stimulate NO formation directly or indirectly via cytokines. However, IFN-alpha concentrations seem to increase or decrease in cirrhotic patients. This study investigated the plasma concentration of IFN-alpha in patients with cirrhosis and its relationship to systemic and portal hemodynamics. METHODS: Thirty-six patients with cirrhosis and 47 healthy controls had blood samples taken for the determination of plasma concentrations of IFN-alpha by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Systemic and portal hemodynamics were measured in patients with cirrhosis on the same day of blood sampling using Swan-Ganz catheterization and the thermodilution technique. RESULTS: As compared with healthy subjects, patients with cirrhosis demonstrated a significantly higher IFN-alpha detectable rate (> 3 pg/ml, 14.9% vs 36.1%, p < 0.05). In cirrhotic patients, the IFN-alpha detectable rates were similar between those with and without decompensation, a hepatic venous pressure gradient greater than 12 mmHg, or the presence of large esophageal varices (p > 0.05). There was no significant difference in the systemic vascular resistance or hepatic venous pressure gradient between cirrhotic patients with and without a detectable plasma IFN-alpha concentration. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma IFN-alpha concentrations tended to increase in patients with cirrhosis. However, IFN-alpha concentrations do not play a role in the hyperdynamic circulation observed in patients with cirrhosis.
