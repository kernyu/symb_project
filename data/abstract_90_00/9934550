We have evaluated the susceptibility of 199 pathogens isolated in pure culture from consecutive urine samples submitted from the community. Rates of susceptibility for all organisms were ampicillin, 48%; amoxycillin/clavulanic acid, 88%; cephalothin, 57%; cefuroxime axetil, 74%; nalidixic acid, 85%; ciprofloxacin, 99%; nitrofurantoin, 78%; and trimethoprim, 67%. Ciprofloxacin resistance and production of extended spectrum beta-lactamase enzymes were detected in Escherichia coli strains isolated from patients in the community.
