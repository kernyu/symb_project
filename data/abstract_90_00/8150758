Cefepime, a novel, injectable alpha-methoxyimino aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, is active in vitro against many of the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria which cause severe infections, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is more active than existing third-generation cephalosporins against multiply-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae because of its low affinity for beta-lactamases and its resistance to hydrolysis by these enzymes. Cefepime retains its high potency of activity against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and streptococci other than enterococci. Seventy-four patients (46 male and 28 female) were treated with cefepime 2 g i.v. every 12 h; 61 patients were evaluable for efficacy (39 male and 22 female). The infections included pneumonia caused by Gram-negative bacilli (21 patients, six with bacteraemia), septicaemia (seven), pyelonephritis (two), osteomyelitis (23, mainly caused by S. aureus), septic arthritis (four) and soft tissue infections (four, one with bacteraemia). Responses were as follows: 52 (85.3%) patients cured; three (4.9%) improved and six (9.8%) failed. The failures included three patients with osteomyelitis, one with pyelonephritis and two with pneumonia. The pathogens and eradication rates were: S. aureus 23/24 (96%), Staphylococcus epidermidis 4/4, Streptococcus spp. 10/10 (100%), P. aeruginosa 11/14 (79%), Enterobacteriaceae 28/28 (100%), Haemophilus spp. 3/3 and others 7/7. Clinical adverse effects included diarrhoea in 11 patients (14.9%) nausea in five (6.8%) and pruritus in three (4.1%). Laboratory abnormalities included leucopenia in three patients (4.1%) and direct Coombs' conversion in 32 (43.2%). Patients were treated for an average of 31.8 days for osteomyelitis and 11.9 days for other infections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
