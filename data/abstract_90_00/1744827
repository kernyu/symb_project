Plasmodium falciparum malaria poses an increasing risk to travellers to West Africa. The development of chloroquine resistant in West Africa has further compounded the risk. Two cases of falciparum malaria from Sierra Leone are presented. One represents the classic missed case and the other a probable case of chloroquine resistant (RI vide infra) falciparum malaria. These cases highlight the danger of the missed or late diagnosis; the need for chemoprophylaxis, even in emigrants; the threat posed to the international traveller by malaria; and the problem of chloroquine resistant Plasmodium falciparum (CRPF) malaria from West Africa. The position of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in West Africa is reviewed along with the problem caused by chloroquine resistance.
