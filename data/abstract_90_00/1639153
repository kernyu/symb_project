The interactions of aging and long-term voluntary ethanol consumption were studied in the alcohol-preferring AA (Alko Alcohol) rats. The mean daily ethanol intake was 6.45 +/- 0.31 g/kg/day (mean +/- SE) at the beginning of the exposure at 3 months of age. The control animals were given only food and water ad libitum. There was no difference in survival or weight gain between the control and ethanol groups. When tested for voluntary ethanol intake at the age of 24 months, the rats in the ethanol group consumed significantly more ethanol than the controls. The two groups did not differ in ethanol-induced motor impairment, sleep-time, or hypothermia, nor in the rate of ethanol elimination. The 24-month-old animals, however, showed higher sensitivity to ethanol than the 3-4-month-old rats in the sleep-time test. It is concluded that the feeding regimen used in this study did not produce any detectable interactions between ethanol and the aging processes in the AA rats.
