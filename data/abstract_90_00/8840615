BACKGROUND: There is a need to develop alternative regimen(s) for treating Helicobacter pylori infection because of problems of drug compliance, side-effects and resistance with the conventional regimen consisting of bismuth, metronidazole and an antibiotic. AIMS: To compare prospectively the efficacy of conventional triple therapy (bismuth subcitrate 120 mg QID, amoxycillin 500 mg QID and metronidazole 400 mg TID for 2 weeks with one containing omeprazole (20 mg OD), bismuth subcitrate and amoxycillin (regimen B). METHODS: Sixty two consecutive patients with H pylori infection associated with antral gastritis and/or duodenal ulcer were randomized to two treatment groups and re- evaluated after completion of 2 weeks of therapy and then after a further 4 weeks for eradication of H pylori, ulcer healing and drug side-effects. RESULTS: Regimen B resulted in higher H pylori eradication rate as compared to regimen A (76.7% vs 63.3%, better ulcer healing rate (90.9%, vs 70.6%), lesser side-effects (10.0% vs 36.7%) and better drug compliance (100% vs 93.3%). The difference between the two regimens was significant (p < 0.05) only in respect to side-effects. CONCLUSION: For H pylori eradication, omeprazole, bismuth and amoxycillin combination for 2 weeks is as effective as the conventional therapy and is better tolerated.
