Azole-resistant oropharyngeal and oesophageal candidiasis is a recent phenomenon observed in patients with AIDS usually previously treated with fluconazole. Some variation has been observed in antifungal susceptibility testing among separate colonies of Candida albicans from the same patient. This raises the question of whether there are multiple clones present or simply phenotypic variation in expression of azole resistance. To address this question we took 18 isolates grown from multiple swabs taken before and after experimental azole therapy from a single HIV-positive individual with fluconazole-resistant oral candidiasis and compared morphotype, karyotype, PCR-based DNA typing and azole susceptibility. Ten of the isolates were from a single 2-day period. Amongst these 10 there were seven morphotypes, five karyotypes and four polymerase chain reaction (PCR) types. Three further morphotypes, one karyotype and two PCR types were found amongst the eight isolates obtained during the subsequent 4 months. Limited variation in susceptibility to two azoles--fluconazole and D0870--was also seen. This work emphasizes both the large genotype and phenotypic variability of C. albicans isolates in the mouth of AIDS patients with fluconazole resistance, and the difficulties in interpretation of present typing methods.
