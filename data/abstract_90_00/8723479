Enterococcus hirae, E. avium, and E. raffinosus isolated in Romania, Tunisia, and Portugal harbored plasmids pICC8, pIP1700, and pIP1701, respectively, encoding resistance to high levels of gentamicin (Gmr). The Gmr marker was carried on pIP1700 by a Tn4001-like element and on pICC8 and pIP1701 by Tn4001-truncated structures. pICC8 carried, in addition to Gmr, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, and tetracycline-minocycline (TetM) resistance determinants. The gene tetM of pICC8 was carried on a Tn916-like element.
