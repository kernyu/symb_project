A novel, broad-host-range 60-kb R-plasmid, which encodes for malonate assimilation, was isolated from Pseudomonas fluorescens and was designated pPSF1. Pseudomonas, which can utilize malonate as a sole carbon source, was unable to grow on malonate medium upon curing with mitomycin C, indicating loss of plasmid pPSF1. Furthermore, Escherichia coli transformed with pPSF1 was able to grow on malonate medium as a sole carbon source. Malonate decarboxylase, a key enzyme in malonate assimilation, was detected in transformed E. coli grown on malonate. pPSF1 also encodes resistance to several antibiotics such as ampicillin, kanamycin, and streptomycin and is transmissible between E. coli and Pseudomonas by conjugation.
