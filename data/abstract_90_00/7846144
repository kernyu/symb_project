An Escherichia coli-Bifidobacterium longum shuttle vector, designated pRM2, was constructed by cloning a B. longum plasmid and an enterococcal spectinomycin resistance gene into a commercial E. coli vector. The plasmid was successfully introduced into B. longum cells by electroporation and into E. coli cells by both electroporation and chemical transformation.
