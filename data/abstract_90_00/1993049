Rodent fibroblasts transformed with the Kirsten and Moloney murine sarcoma viruses exhibit increased resistance to the growth inhibitory and cytotoxic action of the carboxylic Na+/H+ ionophore, monensin. The inhibitory effect of monensin on cell proliferation requires exposure for periods longer than 24 hours. The virus-transformed cells also exhibit increased resistance to the K+/H+ ionophore, nigericin. Since monensin is known to have significant effects upon the function and activity of the Golgi apparatus and the intracellular trafficking and processing of endocytosed as well as cell-derived materials, the results suggest that alterations in the activities of the organelles and pathways involved with intracellular protein trafficking and processing likely make an important contribution to the biological and cellular properties of transformed cells.
