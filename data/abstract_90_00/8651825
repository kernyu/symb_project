Cheilloschisis and uranoschisis are the most important congenital defects in children. This pathology increases the incidence of purulent inflammatory affections due to Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. The isolates were found to have multiple drug resistance determined by R plasmids of different incompatibility groups. The molecular weights of the plasmids were: 3.0, 8.0 and 9.0 MD in Staphylococcus spp., 90.0 and 110.0 MD in P. aeruginosa and P. putida, 33.0, 38.0, 49.0 and 53.0 MD in E. coli. 87.0 per cent of the Staphylococcus strains, 78.9 per cent of the Streptococcus strains, 83.3 per cent of the E. coli strains, 74.0 per cent of the P. aeruginosa strains and 66.6 per cent of the Acinetobacter stains were shown to be sensitive to the commercial pyophage product used in the study.
