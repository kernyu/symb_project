OBJECTIVE: To identify the frequency of drug resistant tuberculosis and to determine risk factors for its development in five health districts in the State of Chiapas, Mexico. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. EMPLACEMENT: Primary care. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with pulmonary tuberculosis diagnosed between September 1 and December 31, 1995. Each patient responded to a questionnaire regarding epidemiological, diagnostic and treatment variables. Sputa were cultured, drug sensitivities and typing of micobacteria were obtained. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There were 142 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis confirmed by acid fast smear. The frequency of resistant M. tuberculosis in 61 positive cultures was 24.2%. Of these, 33.3% was resistant to one drug and 66.7% at two or more drugs. Resistance to isoniazide and rifampicin together was present in 66.7% of the cases. The most frequent resistance, 86.7%, was to isoniazide. A history of multitreatments, either completed or not, resulted in a risk factor 6.48 times greater for drug resistance and patients with a history of abandoning treatment presented an increased risk factor of 5.71. CONCLUSIONS: Drug resistant tuberculosis y a serious problem in Chiapas that requires urgent attention if future control of the disease is to be maintained. The frequency of resistant tuberculosis is high, 24.2%, and the risk factors identified indicate a worsening of the situation with the accumulation of patients inadequeately treated without follow up until cure.
