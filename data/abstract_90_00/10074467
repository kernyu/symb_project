BACKGROUND: Vancomycin-resistant enterococci are pathogenic bacteria that attenuate antibiotic sensitivity by producing peptidoglycan precursors that terminate in D-Ala-D-lactate rather than D-Ala-D-Ala. A key enzyme in effecting antibiotic resistance is the metallodipeptidase VanX, which reduces the cellular pool of the D-Ala-D-Ala dipeptide. RESULTS: We constructed eleven mutants, using the recently determined VanX structure as a basis, to investigate residue function. Mutating Asp142 or Ser114 showed a large effect principally on KM, consistent with roles in recognition of the D-Ala-D-Ala termini. The drastic reduction or absence of activity in the Arg71 mutants correlates with a role in the stabilization of an anionic tetrahedral transition state. Three residues of the Escherichia coli D-Ala-D-Ala ligase (Ddl), Glu15, Ser 281 and Arg255, are similarly conserved and have equivalent functions with respect to VanX, consistent with a convergent evolution of active sites to bind D-Ala-D-Ala and lower energy barriers for formation of the tetrahedral intermediate and transition states. In the N-acyl-D-Ala-D-Ala carboxypeptidase VanY, all active-site residues are conserved (except for the two responsible for recognition of the dipeptide amino terminus). CONCLUSIONS: The mutagenesis results support structure-based functional predictions and explain why the VanX dipeptidase and Ddl ligase show narrow specificity for the D,D-dipeptide substrate. The results reveal that VanX and Ddl, two enzymes that use the same substrate but proceed in opposite directions driven by distinct cofactors (zinc versus ATP), evolved similar architectural solutions to substrate recognition and catalysis acceleration. VanY sequence analysis predicts an active site and mechanism of reaction similar to VanX.
