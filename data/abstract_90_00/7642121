The single gene encoding actin (Act) in the cellulolytic filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei (Tr) has been isolated and characterized. The gene contains five introns located in identical positions when compared to the putative ancestral actin genes (act) present in Thermomyces lanuginosus and Aspergillus nidulans. The 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the gene contains a TATA-like sequence (TAATA), a C + T-rich region and a potential CCAAT motif. This region was used as a homologous promoter to direct expression of hygromycin-B-resistance-encoding gene as a dominant-selectable Tr marker.
