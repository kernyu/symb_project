To strengthen guidelines for vancomycin use, practical guidelines were developed. A prospective survey was conducted of all patients receiving vancomycin during two 1-month periods, 1 year apart, during which significant improvements were noted. Practical guidelines may contribute to appropriateness of vancomycin use, serve as educational tools, and facilitate improved surveillance.
