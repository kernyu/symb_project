Because corynebacteria and mycobacteria have walls of similar composition, it was of interest to test the effects on resistant corynebacteria of two agents with anti-wall effects, i.e., ethambutol (EMB) and isoniazid (INH). Rifampicin was also studied to extend previous data and clarify conflicting results in the literature. INH was not active in levels achieved in vivo with standard dosages. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of EMB was under serum levels for only three of 78 strains. All minimal bactericidal concentration (MBCs) were greater than serum levels. With RIF, 59% of strains were susceptible and 19.2% exhibited intermediate susceptibility as defined by the French Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. CMI and CMB distributions were heterogeneous, suggesting a possible acquired heterogeneous resistance to RIF.
