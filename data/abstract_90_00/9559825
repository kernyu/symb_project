A human cytomegalovirus mutant that was isolated for resistance (10-fold) to the antisense oligonucleotide fomivirsen (ISIS 2922) exhibited cross-resistance to a modified derivative of fomivirsen with an identical base sequence but little or no resistance to an oligonucleotide with an unrelated sequence. No changes in the mutant's DNA corresponding to the fomivirsen target sequence were found.
