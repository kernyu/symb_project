Antimicrobial activity of gemifloxacin (SB-265805), a newly developed fluoroquinolone, to Japanese isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae was compared with those of various fluoroquinolones, including norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, levofloxacin, sparfloxacin, and trovafloxacin. Among the fluoroquinolones tested, gemifloxacin was most active against N. gonorrhoeae isolates. The MIC90 values of gemifloxacin for 94 N. gonorrhoeae isolated from 1992 through 1993 and 100 isolated from 1996 through 1997 were 0.03 and 0.125 microg/ml, respectively. On the other hand, MIC90 values of the other fluoroquinolone for the 1992-1993 isolates and the 1996-1997 isolates ranged from 0.125 to 2 microg/ml and from 0.5 to 8 microg/ml, respectively. Gemifloxacin was also the most potent fluoroquinolone against 31 ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates with the ciprofloxacin MIC of 1 to 16 microg/ml, for which the gemifloxacin MIC50 and MIC90 values were 0.25 and 2 microg/ml, respectively. Moreover, the activity of gemifloxacin against fluoroquinolone-resistant gonococcal isolates containing multiple amino acid substitutions in both GyrA and ParC proteins was superior to those of the other compounds.
