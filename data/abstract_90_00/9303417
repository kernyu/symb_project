The ahpC genes of 57 clinical isolates and one in vitro mutant of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were evaluated by nucleotide sequence analyses. Although compensatory ahpC promoter mutations were identified in 8 catalase-negative, katG-defective strains, the ahpC genes of 25 catalase-positive, isoniazid-resistant isolates and 25 drug-sensitive strains were not altered.
