From the microbiological point of view a variety of highly active compounds has contributed to improved efficacy of antibacterial chemotherapy during the last few decades. In some cases, however, resistance has increased due to different molecular mechanisms. Resistance to the new generation of broad-spectrum beta-lactams is in the cases of TEM and SHV enzymes based upon the stepwise acquisition of point mutations within the structural gene. Multiresistance to aminoglycosides is caused by a combination of different genes coding for aminoglycoside modifying enzymes on transferable plasmids. Resistance to glycopeptides has recently been detected in enterococci and is due to a new mechanism of resistance. These substances have so far had unlimited activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and have been widely used for treatment of pseudomembranous colitis. While all the three mechanisms of resistance mentioned above are transferable among different strains, no evidence exists so far for transferable resistance to 4-quinolones. However, for S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa an increase of resistance has been reported. The underlying mechanisms seem to be unchanged. The detection of global changes in the development of resistance and the discrimination of these changes from local events requires recording of statistically significant data obtained with approved methods and evaluation of the data with standardized international breakpoints. Consequently, the use of new agents should be controlled efficiently.
