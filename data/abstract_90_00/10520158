The effect of human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on the growth of Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida species was tested in RPMI-1640. CSF alone was highly fungistatic for both yeasts and inhibited growth in a concentration-dependent manner. Unlike human serum, CSF did not collaborate with fluconazole for killing C. neoformans. Molecular sieve fractionation of CSF on a G-200 Sephadex column yielded a highly antifungal fraction with a molecular weight around 66 kDa. On SDS-PAGE this fraction migrated as a major and a minor band corresponding to the mobility of bovine serum albumin. These novel findings suggest that CSF contains a factor(s) that provides resistance to the growth of C. neoformans or Candida species.
