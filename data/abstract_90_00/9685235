Like other nonnucleoside inhibitors of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, the dipyridodiazepinone nevirapine (Viramune, 1) selects for drug resistant variants of HIV-1, both in cell culture and in patients. In particular, the mutation of residue 181 from tyrosine to cysteine (Y181C) is associated with resistance to most reported nonnucleoside inhibitors. Introduction of an arylethyl substituent at the 8-position of the tricyclic dipyridodiazepinone skeleton confers enhanced potency against Y181C RT. Several analogues of this series display good broad spectrum potency against a panel of mutant enzymes.
