Three reported cases of infection with strains of Staphylococcus aureus that had only intermediate susceptibility to vancomycin raise fears that high-level vancomycin resistance may soon be seen.

We review treatment options and the recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to identify and slow the spread of resistant strains.
