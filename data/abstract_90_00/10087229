Growth of tumors induced by Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) is controlled by alleles at the major histocompatibility complex locus in chickens, indicating that immunological host defense mechanisms play a major role. We show here that the resistance phenotype of CB regressor chickens can be partially reverted by treating the animals with a monoclonal antibody that neutralizes the major serotype of chicken type I interferon, ChIFN-alpha. Injection of recombinant ChIFN-alpha into susceptible CC progressor chickens resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of RSV-induced tumor development. This treatment was not effective, however, in CC chickens challenged with a DNA construct expressing the v-src oncogene, suggesting that the beneficial effect of type I interferon in this system resulted from its intrinsic antiviral activity and probably not from indirect immunmodulatory effects. By contrast, recombinant chicken interferon-gamma strongly inhibited tumor growth when given to CC chickens that were challenged with the v-src oncogene, indicating that the two cytokines target different steps of tumor development.
