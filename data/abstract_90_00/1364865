The malaria situation in Indonesia is reviewed in the major island group of Java-Bali and the remainder of the archipelago called the Outer Islands. Based on their varying epidemiological patterns the areas for control have been stratified and efforts are directed towards the rational use of antimalarial drugs and the institution of integrated vector control ie chemical control in conjunction with biological control and environmental management. The targets of malaria control vary as well between island groups. Administrative, technical and operational constraints are identified. Drug-resistant malaria, forest-related malaria, lack of personnel, supervision and coordination, inadequate resources, and community participation are among the main issues confronting the national malaria control program. Research and training needs are emphasized in the recommendations.
