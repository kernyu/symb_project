One hundred and ninety seven strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated from urine (59 strains), wound pus (60 strains), sputum (30 strains), stool (30 strains) and eye discharge (18 strains) at Kaohsiung medical College Hospital. These strains were serotyped with antisera against O antigens and tested with twelve different antimicrobial agents. The results showed that the most frequently isolated strains were serotype E (41.1%), followed by serotype B (20.3%), serotype F (10.7%) and serotype L (9.1%). In in vitro susceptibility testing, all isolated strains were resistant to chloramphenicol and tetracycline. Otherwise, these isolates were highly susceptible to ceftazidime (95.4%), enoxacin (89.3%) and piperacillin (87.8%). The isolates from urine exhibited more multiple drug resistance patterns than those of other specimens. When plasmid content was analysed from pseudomonas aeruginosa, only 15.2% (30/197) of isolates carried plasmids. By conjugation, transformation and mobilization experiments, it was shown that 13.3% (4/30) of plasmid carrying strains contained R plasmids.
