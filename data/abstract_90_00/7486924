The efficacy of cefazolin or cefpirome alone or combined with rifampin was compared with that of vancomycin alone or combined with rifampin in an experimental model of methicillin-resistant, beta-lactamase-producing, coagulase-negative staphylococcal endocarditis. Phenotypically, the mecA gene-positive strain used in vivo did not exhibit methicillin resistance by the agar dilution or disk susceptibility method but was resistant in vitro (oxacillin MIC, 64 micrograms/ml) by the microtiter dilution method with 2% NaCl supplementation. Macrodilution broth susceptibilities of standard inocula failed to demonstrate cross-resistance of staphylococci to cefazolin (MIC, 8 micrograms/ml) or cefpirome (MIC, 4 micrograms/ml). In vivo, vancomycin and cefpirome had similar activities, and both regimens were more effective than was cefazolin alone. While the MIC of rifampin was low (0.031 micrograms/ml), monotherapy with rifampin resulted in a bimodal distribution of outcomes due to the expected emergence of resistant mutants. The results in vitro of time-kill synergy studies using rifampin in combination with cefazolin or cefpirome varied with the antimicrobial concentrations tested and did not reliably predict activities in vivo of rifampin-beta-lactam combination therapies. Cefpirome, but not cefazolin or vancomycin, in combination with rifampin was synergistic in vivo. Cefpirome in combination with rifampin was more effective than was cefazolin in combination with rifampin. Both cephalosporin-rifampin regimens were significantly more effective than was cephalosporin or vancomycin monotherapy and were as effective as vancomycin combined with rifampin. These data support further evaluation of rifampin-beta-lactam combinations as possible alternative therapies to vancomycin-containing regimens for selected methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcal infections.
