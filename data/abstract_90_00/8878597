In vivo synergy with beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides has been studied only with penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae strains. We evaluated the interaction between amoxicillin (AMX) and gentamicin (GEN) on the basis of in vitro checkerboard and time-kill curves and of findings in a mouse model of acute bacteremic pneumonia due to a highly penicillin-resistant and -tolerant S. pneumoniae strain of serotype 19 (penicillin and AMX MICs of 4 micrograms/ml; gentamicin MIC of 16 micrograms/ml). Checkerboard results at 18 h of incubation showed indifference. With regard to AMX alone, in vitro time-kill curves demonstrated synergy between AMX (1 microgram/ml) and GEN (16 micrograms/ml) at 5 and 8 h of incubation and for AMX (16 micrograms/ml) in combination with GEN (16 micrograms/ml) at 3, 5, and 8 h of incubation. In leukopenic mice, pulmonary killing curves after a single drug injection demonstrated that AMX (100 mg/kg of body weight) with GEN (16 mg/kg) was more effective than AMX alone (P = 10(-4). With repeated-dose treatment, a synergy was apparent at 8 h after four injections with AMX (100 mg/kg) in combination with GEN (8 or 16 mg/kg) (P < or = 0.05). The cumulative survival rate with AMX (100 mg/kg) every 8 h, combined with GEN (4 or 8 mg/kg) every 8, 12, or 24 h, was better than with AMX alone. Combined use of AMX and GEN may be a valuable therapeutic alternative for pneumococcal pneumonia due to highly penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae strains.
