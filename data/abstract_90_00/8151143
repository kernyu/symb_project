The serotype variants were formed in some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the presence of anti-pseudomonal drugs in vitro. Pyocin type, various biochemical properties and drug susceptibility of these variants were compared with those of the parent cells. Furthermore, the patterns of outer membrane proteins were also examined for some respective parent and variant cells by the SDS-PAGE and compared with their drug susceptibilities. In P. aeruginosa No. 1-S (serotype E) and No. 1-R (serotype C), simultaneously isolated from the identical specimen of the infectious patient, the serotype variants were formed by anti-pseudomonal drugs and accompanied by changes in pyocin types, some biochemical properties and susceptibilities to various kinds of anti-pseudomonal drugs. When the profiles of outer membrane proteins of P. aeruginosa No. 1-R parent and two variant cells were evaluated by the SDS-PAGE, the quantitative differences of the porin proteins between the parent and variant cells were well related to their drug susceptibilities. Although eight variant cells with other serotype were formed from the parent cells (serotype A) of P. aeruginosa No. 13, four variants with serotype M and one non-typable variant showed changes in drug susceptibility such as resistance to imipenem only and no changes in biochemical properties. On the other hand, three other variants showed marked changes in two kinds of biochemical properties and in susceptibilities to various kinds of anti-pseudomonal drugs. From the results of SDS-PAGE, it was found that the porin protein profiles of outer membranes of these parent and variant cells except a few cells which corresponded to their drug susceptibility.
