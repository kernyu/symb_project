Few alternative treatments are available for those patients with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis who fail to respond to the conventional treatment of corticosteroids. Such patients have a poor prognosis and frequently require liver transplantation. We report a patient with autoimmune hepatitis who failed treatment with corticosteroids and azathioprine. He responded to treatment with cyclosporine but relapsed with its discontinuation; reinstitution of the cyclosporine again induced remission. Cyclosporine appears to be an effective alternative treatment in patients with steroid-resistant, autoimmune chronic active hepatitis; its use may preclude or delay liver transplantation.
