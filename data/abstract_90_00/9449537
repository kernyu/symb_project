Resistance usually manifests following long-term dideoxynucleoside therapy of HIV-1 infection. This period appears to coincide with reduced dosage regimens. Resistance that is associated with long-term monotherapy may, in part, be due to decreased intracellular drug concentrations. It has been reported that intracellular uptake of the dideoxynucleosides is enhanced by dipyridamole. Hence, dipyridamole may potentially be used to optimize the effects of zalcitabine in HIV-1 antiretroviral "cocktail". The purpose of this study was to characterize the pharmacokinetics of zalcitabine when administered alone and concomitantly with dipyridamole. Also, we determined, indirectly, whether dipyridamole modulated the intracellular uptake of zalcitabine. Rats were intravenously administered either zalcitabine 100 mg/kg alone or with dipyridamole 15 mg/kg. Except renal clearance (CIR), there were no statistically significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters including the steady-state volume of distribution and distribution coefficient. Zalcitabine plasma concentrations declined rapidly in a bi-exponential fashion, with a terminal half-life of 1.03 +/- 0.18 hr. alone versus 1.08 +/- 0.22 hr. with dipyridamole. The area under the concentration-time curve was not significantly different with or without dipyridamole. ClR, was 1.42 +/- 0.37 l/hr./kg for zalcitabine alone versus 1.09 +/- 0.28 l/hr./kg with dipyridamole. Our single dose study show that zalcitabine disposition kinetics were not significantly modulated by dipyridamole.
