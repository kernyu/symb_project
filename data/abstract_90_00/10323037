Antibiotic options for patients with methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections are severely limited. Unfortunately, infections with S. aureus with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin and teicoplanin have been recently reported for the first time. Commonly used laboratory methods for determining antibiotic susceptibility may be inadequate for detecting reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. Even though no confirmed cases have yet been detected in Australia, a high index of suspicion must be maintained for the occurrence of such organisms. Strategies for prevention of the spread of S. aureus with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin should be prepared by Australian hospitals prior to their first cases being identified. This article outlines the background to this developing issue and discusses laboratory methods and findings, with some current recommendations for diagnostic laboratories.
