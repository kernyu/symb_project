An outbreak of multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter spp. infection in the neonatal unit at King Edward VIII hospital in Durban, South Africa, is described. Nine out of a total of 218 neonates were infected during the study period. The outbreak was characterized by early onset infection [median postnatal age 3 days (range 1-23 days)] in pre-term babies [median gestational age 33 weeks (range 30-35 weeks)] with an attributable mortality of 22%. The source of the outbreak, determined by ribotyping, was presumed to be contaminated suction bottles and catheters in the neonatal admission room. Five neonates were successfully treated with ciprofloxacin and amikacin. Enforcement of strict infection control practices curtailed the outbreak.
