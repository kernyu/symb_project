Resistance to erythromycin and doxycycline and more recently to fluoroquinolones has been reported to occur in Campylobacter spp. both in vitro and in patients treated with these antibiotics. The frequency of resistance to 14 antimicrobial agents in Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli isolated from patients infected in Sweden or abroad is described. For some agents, a comparison of susceptibility in strains of Campylobacter spp. isolated in 1978 with those isolated in 1988 is made. No general increase in in vitro resistance to antibiotics commonly used for the treatment of human gastroenteritis caused by C. jejuni or C. coli has occurred during the last 10 years in Sweden, which might be a consequence of strict antibiotic control. The numbers of strains from 1988 to 1989 resistant to ciprofloxacin and to norfloxacin included in this study (0.7 and 1.4%, respectively) are still fewer than those that were resistant to erythromycin (7.3%) or doxycycline (12.4%). There is, however, since 1989 to 1990 an indication of increasing resistance to these antibiotics.
