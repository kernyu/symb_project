OBJECTIVE: To investigate the resistant status and factors involved and to evaluate the efficacy of treatment in relapse pulmonary tuberculosis. METHODS: The analysis of history of chemotherapy and resistant status in 448 relapse pulmonary tuberculosis cases with culture positive and susceptibility test was conducted. All new registered relapse cases during 1988-1997 in Beijing were treated with regimen of 2RHZS(E)/4RHE or 2RHZS(E)/6RH under fully supervision and prognosis was evaluated with cohort analysis. RESULTS: Of 448 relapse cases 153 (34.2%) were resistant at least to 1 antituberculosis drug, 20.9% resistant to INH, 17.6% to SM, 11.1% to RFP, 7.8% to PAS, 2.9% to EMB and 6.2% resistant to both INH and RFP. The resistance rates in the cases of compliance and default in initial treatment were 22.3% and 55.8%, respectively, and resistance to RFP were 6.3% and 20.8% respectively. The sputum conversion rate in relapse cases during 1988-1997 were 80.5%-89.6%. CONCLUSIONS: The resistant rate in relapse cases in Beijing was 34.1%. The higher compliance in the chemotherapy, the lower resistant rate, conversely the higher default the higher resistance. The majority of resistant cases were resistant to INH, SM and RFP, and it is important in making a rational regimen.
