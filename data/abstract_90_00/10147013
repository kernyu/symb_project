Using official statistics for the consumption of antibiotics in Sweden during the period 1975 to 1991, the pharmacoeconomic consequences were analysed. An increase of more than 25% in Swedish consumption of antibiotics during the study period was found. There is no obvious clinical explanation; indeed, improved hospital hygiene as well as decreased frequencies of some common bacterial infections should have resulted in a decrease in total consumption. Overconsumption was most marked for oral antibiotics. In 1991 the most often used antibiotic, phenoxymethylpenicillin, was given in about 20 million defined daily doses (DDD), corresponding to 2.4 DDDs per member of the population per year. From a pharmacoeconomic viewpoint, this overconsumption is acceptable because the drug has a low price and causes a minimum of severe adverse reactions. More serious is the marked misuse of tetracyclines (12 million DDDs in 1991) and macrolides (5.3 million DDDs in 1991), with which adverse reactions are more common, and where the high consumption has led to increasing frequencies of resistance among common bacterial pathogens. This emergent resistance often leads to a need to use newer more expensive antibiotics, in addition to the costs resulting from therapeutic failures of the initial treatment. Of the parenteral antibiotics, the cephalosporins, particularly cefuroxime, dominate in Sweden. The introduction of 'diagnosis-related groups' (DRGs) for reimbursement of hospitals for in-patient care is likely to result in the development of antibiotic use in 'intensive home care' as has occurred in the US.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
