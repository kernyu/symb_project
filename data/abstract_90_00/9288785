Embryonic fibroblast cell lines were established from mice deficient, heterozygous, or proficient for Msh2, one of the three known DNA mismatch repair genes involved in hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC). Cell lines were established by transfection of primary mouse embryo fibroblasts with E7 and Ras oncogenes or mutant p53. Spontaneously immortalized cells derived from the primary cultures were also studied. To determine whether these cells developed a mutator phenotype similar to that found in colon cancer cells deficient in mismatch repair, we measured mutation rates, microsatellite instability, and sensitivities to a range of DNA-damaging agents. The mutator phenotype detected in the E7 and Ras or mutant p53-immortalized Msh2-/- mouse cells was similar to that found in human mismatch repair-deficient colorectal carcinoma cell lines. Mutation rates to ouabain resistance were increased 8-12-fold relative to lines from Msh2+/+ mice, and microsatellite instability was detectable in 12-18% of subclones derived from the Msh2-/- line but was undetectable in subclones developed from the Msh2+/+ line. Furthermore, E7 and Ras or spontaneously immortalized Msh2-/- cells were significantly more resistant to the cytotoxic effects of 6-thioguanine relative to Msh2+/+ cells. In contrast, these lines showed various responses to UV light and cis-platinum, suggesting that mismatch repair deficiency was not the sole determinant for sensitivity to these DNA-damaging agents. Particular attention was paid to the properties of cells heterozygous for the Msh2 mutant gene, which would mimic the situation of an HNPCC carrier. However, our studies failed to reveal any properties of these cells that might provide a growth advantage or predispose them for the acquisition of further mutations. This observation is consistent with the model that inactivation of the wild-type Msh2 allele is a critical step for tumorigenesis in HNPCC patients.
