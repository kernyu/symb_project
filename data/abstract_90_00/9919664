A classification of the different erm gene classes based on published sequences was performed, and specific primers to detect some of these classes designed. The presence of ermA (Tn554), ermB (class IV) and ermC (class VI) was determined by PCR in a total of 113 enterococcal, 77 streptococcal and 68 staphylococcal erythromycin resistant isolates of animal and human origin. At least one of these genes was detected in 88% of the isolates. Four isolates contained more than one erm gene. ermB dominated among the enterococci (88%) and streptococci (90%) and ermC among staphylococci (75%) with ermA (Tn554) present in some isolates (16%). Variations in the presence of the different genes when comparing staphylococcal isolates of human and animal origin were observed.
