A strain of Haemonchus contortus, susceptible to ivermectin (IVM), was submitted to a selection procedure using IVM at 0.02 mg kg-1 during nine successive passages in lambs. Treatment reduced worm egg counts (epg) by more than 99% up to the seventh passage, but thereafter there was no significant reduction in epg. The efficacy of ivermectin against the ninth selected generation compared with the original susceptible strain was assessed. The results showed that animals infected with the selected strain and treated with IVM did not show any significant reduction (P > 0.05) in epg compared with a 99.9% reduction in the susceptible group. At necropsy, post-treatment worm burdens confirmed that the selection pressure applied to the original strain had been successful in stimulating resistance to IVM.
