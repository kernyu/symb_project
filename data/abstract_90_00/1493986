Sixty-two patients with blood culture-proven typhoid fever were randomly assigned to receive either 500 or 750 mg of ciprofloxacin orally, twice daily for 7 days or for two days following defervescence, whichever was greater. Thirty-four and 28 patients received 500 mg and 750 mg respectively. Strains of Salmonella typhi resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol and co-trimoxazole were isolated from the blood of 27 patients (43.5%). No resistance to ciprofloxacin was encountered. Both regimens were equally effective; fever subsided in mean times of 4.9 +/- 1.7 days in the 500 mg group and 5.2 +/- 2.2 days in the 750 mg group (P = 0.54). All patients were cured, although one patient in the 750 mg group experienced a presumed relapse two months following completion of therapy. Ciprofloxacin administered for 7-10 days was adequate treatment for 57 of the 62 patients (92%); only five patients required therapy for more than 10 days. Patients with pretreatment symptoms of > or = 10 days duration defervesced in a mean of 5.7 +/- 2.3 days compared with 4.5 +/- 1.3 days (P = 0.01) for those with symptoms of shorter duration. We conclude that 500 mg of ciprofloxacin taken orally twice daily is adequate treatment for typhoid fever.
