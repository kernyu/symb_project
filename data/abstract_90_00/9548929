Seven arginine residues are conserved in all the tetracycline/H+ antiporters of Gram-negative bacteria. Four (Arg67, -70, -71, and -127) of them are located in the putative cytoplasmic loop regions and three (Arg31, -101, and -238) in the putative periplasmic loop regions [Eckert, B., and Beck, C. F. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 11663-11670]. These arginine residues were replaced by alanine, lysine, or cysteine one by one through site-directed mutagenesis. None of the mutants showed significant alteration of the protein expression level. The mutants resulting in the replacement of Arg31, Arg67, Arg71, and Arg238 with either Ala, Cys, or Lys retained tetracycline resistance levels comparable to that of the wild type. Among them, only the Arg238 --> Ala mutant showed very low transport activity in everted membrane vesicles, probably due to the instability of the mutant protein. The replacement of Arg70 and Arg127 with Ala or Cys resulted in a drastic decrease in the drug resistance and almost complete loss of the transport activity, while the Lys replacement mutants retained significant resistance and transport activity, indicating that the positively charged side chains at these positions conferred the transport function. On the other hand, neither the Ala, Cys, nor Lys replacement mutant of Arg101 exhibited any drug resistance or transport activity. As for the reactivity of the Cys replacement mutants, only two (Arg71 --> Cys and Arg101 --> Cys) were not reactive with NEM, the other five mutants being highly or moderately reactive. The reactivity of the cysteine-scanning mutants around Arg101 with NEM revealed that Arg101 is located in transmembrane helix IV. It is not likely that Arg101 confers the protein folding through a salt bridge with a transmembrane acidic residue because no double mutants involving Arg101 --> Ala and the replacement of one of three transmembrane acidic residues (Asp15, Asp84, and Asp285) showed the recovery of any tetracycline resistance or transport activity. The effect of tetracycline on the [14C]NEM binding to the combined mutants S65C/R101A and L97C/R101A suggests that Arg101 may cause a substrate-induced conformational change of the putative exit gate of TetA(B).
