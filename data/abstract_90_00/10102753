Bonding of a tooth fragment to the remaining tooth substance can restore crown fracture of an anterior tooth. In this study, sheep central incisors were used. The crowns were fractured transversely and the crown fragment was bonded to the remaining tooth structure. This technique involves acid etching, use of an experimental adhesive (Gluma+) and a BisGMA/TEGDMA resin. The mean fracture strength of the restored teeth was not significantly different from that of intact teeth when tested at a rather low crosshead speed (0.5 mm/min) but different and about 30% lower when tested at a higher crosshead speed (500 mm/min). In studies aiming to test resistance to forces which might cause trauma, it might be appropriate to use a high crosshead speed.
