During the past 2 decades, treatment of livestock parasitism has changed from a situation of relative stability, particularly in the mid-late 1980s when the macrocyclic lactone compounds were introduced, to the situation in many countries now where control of sheep parasites is rapidly being lost. As serious as the situation may be, now is not a time to wring our hands in despair but a time to address some of the limitations and identify opportunities where a greater integration of the efforts of research and industrial bodies might be directed to maintaining parasite control in our livestock industry.
