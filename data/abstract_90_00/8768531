The global regulators agr and sar control expression of cell wall and extracellular proteins. Inactivation of either sar and/or agr in a typical heterogeneously methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus resulted in a small but reproducible decrease in the number of cells in the subpopulation expressing high methicillin resistance. The amount of low affinity penicillin-binding protein PBP2', the prerequisite for methicillin resistance, was apparently not affected, however, a reduction in PBP1 and PBP3 production was observed, suggesting that these resident PBPs of the cells might be involved somehow together with PBP2' in high level methicillin resistance.
