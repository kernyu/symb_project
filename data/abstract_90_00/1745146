231 Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus (MRS) and 76 Methicillin-Susceptible Staphylococcus (MSS) strains were investigated for Staphylococcal Protein A, bacteriocin, DNase and beta lactamase production properties. It was found that 73.6% of the strains of MRS were positive for protein A, 3.8% for bacteriocin, 76.2% for DNase and 84.4% for beta lactamase production. And it was found that 61.8% of MSS strains were positive for protein A, 11.8% for bacteriocin, 55.2% for DNase and 57.9% for beta lactamase production. Staphylococcal protein A, DNase and lactamase production. Staphylococcal protein A, DNase and lactamase production were found to be significantly higher in MRS strains than MSS strains and bacteriocin production was found to be higher in MSS strains than MRS strains according to Chi Square Test.
