The combinations of foscarnet plus 2',3'-dideoxyinosine and foscarnet plus 2',3'-dideoxycytidine synergistically inhibit the replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 isolates, including two 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine-resistant isolates. The combination of 2',3'-dideoxyinosine plus 2',3'-dideoxycytidine showed additive inhibition of the majority of the human immunodeficiency virus isolates tested. All three combinations showed pronounced antagonistic cytotoxicity and thus were less toxic to the growth of peripheral blood mononuclear cells than the separate drugs.
