Diminazene aceturate is one of a limited number of compounds currently marketed for treatment of trypanosomiasis in cattle, sheep and goats. The pharmacokinetics of the compound in goats suggest that double treatment with diminazene aceturate might enhance the compound's therapeutic activity. A study was therefore conducted in goats using two clones of Trypanosoma congolense, IL 3274 and IL 1180, which were previously shown to be resistant and sensitive, respectively, to single treatment with diminazene aceturate. The results indicated that, as compared to single treatment, double treatment with diminazene aceturate at a dose of 7.2 mg kg-1 bodyweight, at either eight or 24 hour intervals, did not greatly enhance the therapeutic activity of the drug. Furthermore, treatment with the same drug dose eliminated infections with T congolense IL 3274 when treatment was administered 24 hours after infected Glossina morsitans centralis had fed, but failed to do so if treatment was delayed until after goats were detected to be parasitaemic. This suggests that failure of T congolense IL 3274 to respond to treatment with diminazene may not be due to drug resistance per se.
