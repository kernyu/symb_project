OBJECTIVE: To explore the mechanism of cisplatin resistance and its reversion in human ovarian cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cisplatin resistant cell subline of SKOV3, SKOV3/cp, was established, and a xenograft mice model of human ovarian cancer was established by microencapsulation technology. Various biochemical changes and the effects of modulators on the resistance in the model were observed. RESULTS: The intracellular platinum accumulation. Pt-DNA adducts and interstrand cross links of DNA (ISC) in SKOV3 was 5.1, 2.4 and 4.8 times respectively of those in SKOV3/cp cell line. Amphotericin B (AmB) and Novobiocin (NVB) could raise platinum accumulation and Pt-DNA adducts concentration in SKOV3/cp and this resulted in reversion of cisplatin resistance. CONCLUSIONS: The primary factors resulting in SKOV3/cp resistance to cisplatin are the reduction of intracellular drugs and the augmentation of the ability to remove Pt-DNA adducts. AmB and NVB can reverse cisplatin resistance in SKOV3/cp cells.
