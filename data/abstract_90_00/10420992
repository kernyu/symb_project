The multidrug resistance of cancer cells can be mediated by an overexpression of the human MDR1 and MRP genes, which encode the transmembrane efflux pumps, the 170 kDa P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and the 190 kDa multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP), respectively. In this study, we investigate which protein is preferentially overexpressed in the function of doxorubicin concentrations in the acute myelogenous leukemia cell line (OCI/AML-2). Multidrug-resistant AML-2 sublines were isolated in doxorubicin concentrations of 20, 100, 250, and 500 ng/ml. MRP was at first expressed at low concentrations of less than 5 x IC50 (100 ng/ml) of doxorubicin followed by the overexpression of Pgp with concentrations of more than 12.5 x IC50 (250 ng/ml) of doxorubicin. In addition, it appeared that increased amounts of MRP and its mRNA in AML-2/DX20 and /DX100 decreased gradually in both AML-2/DX250 and /DX500 overexpressing Pgp. In conclusion, it is thought that the overexpression of MRP or Pgp is dependent upon drug concentrations. It could be implicated that the overexpression of MRP might be negatively related to that of Pgp.
