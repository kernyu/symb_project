Susceptibilities of Enterococcus faecalis, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia spp. isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 hospitals during June 1990 to May 1991 to various antimicrobial agents were compared with those in the same period of previous years according to a classification, uncomplicated UTIs, complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter, and complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter. The susceptibilities of E. faecalis to minocycline (MINO) and ofloxacin (OFLX) has decreased. As for Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp. and P. mirabilis, which were detected very few in 1989 and 1990, their susceptibilities were not observed an obvious change. The susceptibilities of E. coli to MINO was observed a very clear alteration, that is, in uncomplicated UTIs and complicated UTIs, the susceptibilities has decreased. However, the susceptibilities of Klebsiella spp., P. aeruginosa and Serratia spp. were not observed an obvious variation.
