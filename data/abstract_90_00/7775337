Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) induces bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) to bradykinin but not to acetylcholine. We examined whether this was mediated through the inhibition of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) activity and/or through the enhancement of airway microvascular leakage (AML) by IL-1 beta. We administered human recombinant IL-1 beta (500 U) or saline intratracheally and 24 h later measured the airway responses to bradykinin (1 mM; 45 breaths). IL-1 beta-treated rats showed a decrease of 18.5 and 21.1% of NEP activity in the lungs and tracheobronchial tree, respectively (P < 0.05), associated with an augmented response in total lung resistance to bradykinin but with no increase in Evans blue dye extravasation used as a marker of AML. Phosphoramidon (0.1 and 1 mM; 90 breaths), an NEP inhibitor, induced a dose-dependent increase in lung resistance to bradykinin without further enhancing BHR induced by IL-1 beta. Bradykinin-induced AML was not enhanced by phosphoramidon in either saline- or IL-1 beta-treated rats. Similarly, after captopril (1 mM; 90 breaths), an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, there was no further enhancement of BHR to bradykinin induced by IL-1 beta. BHR to bradykinin induced by IL-1 beta may result from an inhibition of peptidase activity, such as NEP and angiotensin-converting enzyme, and is not associated with an enhancement of AML.
