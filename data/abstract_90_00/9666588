BACKGROUND: Leuconostoc spp. are gram-positive coccobacilli, catalase and oxidase negative, vancomycin resistant, with a not clearly defined role in human infectious. Cases of infection have been reported previously but it has not been described confirmed infective endocarditis due to Leuconostoc mesenteroides. METHODS: We describe a case of prosthetic valve endocarditis in a 72-years-old woman with a long previous history of cardiac disease but without other immunological disorders. She developed a heart failure because of prosthetic aortic valve dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Leuconostoc mesenteroides should be considered as a potential cause of infective endocarditis and listed in the group of vancomycin-resistant microorganism.
