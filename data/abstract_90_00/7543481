Mutations that disrupt each of seven specific G-C base pairs in 16S rRNA from Escherichia coli confer loss of expression of a plasmid-encoded 16S rRNA selectable marker (spectinomycin resistance). However, A-U replacement of G-C base pairs at nucleotides 359/52 or 1292/1245 in 16S rRNA permits normal expression of the marker. By contrast, A-U replacements at 146/176, 153/168, 350/339, or 1293/1244 are associated with loss of expression of the marker. These genetic studies are designed to determine the importance of specific base pairs by assessment of the structural and functional impairments of 16S rRNA molecules resulting from expression of base pair substitutions at these positions.
