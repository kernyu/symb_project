Nalidixic acid and three fluoroquinolones were tested on 389 strains belonging to 13 bacterial species, all isolated in Algeria. Ofloxacin, norfloxacin and pefloxacin have the same activities on E. coli, Acinetobacter and S. aureus. Norfloxacin has the best activity on Proteus, Enterobacter, Shigella and Klebsiella. Norfloxacin and ofloxacin have the same activities on S. typhi, Salmonella and choleric Vibrio. Norfloxacin has the same activity than pefloxacin on P. aeruginosa. It is necessary to prescribe a quinolone in the right way and to consider the pharmacokinetic properties.
