In vitro antifungal activities of omoconazole nitrate (OMZ), a novel antifungal imidazole antimycotic drug, are examined against clinical isolates obtained from patients with cutaneous mycosis and its activity was compared with that of bifonazole (BFZ). The clinical isolates tested were 70 of dermatophytes including Trichophyton rubrum (47 isolates), T. mentagrophytes (22 isolates), Microsporum gypseum (1 isolate), and 27 isolates of Candida albicans. MIC values of OMZ to dermatophytes distributed in a range of < or = 0.04 to 0.63 microgram/ml were similar to those of BFZ (< or = 0.04 to 1.25 micrograms/ml). MIC values of OMZ to C. albicans were in a range of 0.16 to 2.5 micrograms/ml indicating that OMZ had more potent activities than BFZ (1.25 to 5 micrograms/ml). These results showed that in vitro antifungal activities of OMZ against clinical isolates of dermatophytes and C. albicans were greater than or similar to those of BFZ.
