In vivo and in vitro efficacy of tetracyclines was studied with respect to anthracic infection induced by a tetracycline-resistant resistant strain containing plasmid pBC16. The plasmid-containing strain was resistant to tetracycline, doxycycline and minocycline, the MICs exceeding those for the initial strain 500, 640 and 80 times, respectively. There was no therapeutic effect of tetracycline and doxycycline in the treatment and urgent prophylaxis of anthracic infection caused by the tetracycline-resistant strain of Bacillus anthracis. High therapeutic efficacy of minocycline in the average therapeutic concentrations was shown irrespective of the contaminating doses and strains. Minocycline was recommended for treatment and urgent prophylaxis of anthracic infection caused by tetracycline-resistant B. anthracis strains.
