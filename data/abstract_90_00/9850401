An artemisinin derivative (artesunate or artemether) was used for the treatment of multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria in 83 Karen pregnant women in Thailand; 55 women were treated for recrudescent infection following quinine or mefloquine, 12 for uncomplicated hyperparasitaemic episodes, and 16 had not declared their pregnancy when treated. The women were followed weekly until delivery. Artesunate and artemether were well tolerated and there was no drug-related adverse effect. Recrudescence within 42 d occurred in 16% of the treated episodes. Overall 73 pregnancies (88%) resulted in live births, 3 (4%) in abortions and 2 (3%) in still births, and 5 women were lost to follow-up before delivery. There was no congenital abnormality in any of the newborn children, and the 46 children followed for more than one year all developed normally.
