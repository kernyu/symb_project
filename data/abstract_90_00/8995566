OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of etoposide, methotrexate, and actinomycin D (EMA) as primary and secondary therapy for gestational trophoblastic tumor (GTT). METHODS: In a retrospective study, the medical records of all patients with middle-risk metastatic GTT or nonmetastatic choriocarcinoma receiving primary EMA and patients with GTT resistant to single-agent regimens treated with secondary EMA were reviewed. Hematologic toxicity was graded using WHO criteria. RESULTS: Seven patients received primary EMA with 5 (67%) achieving remission. Twenty-two patients with resistance to single-agent regimens received secondary EMA with 21 (95%) achieving remission. The most acute hematologic toxicity was grade 1 or 2. Only 2 of 90 EMA cycles were associated with grade 4 toxicity requiring hospital admission. CONCLUSION: Although EMA effectively induces remission with minimal acute hematologic toxicity in the primary and secondary therapy of GTT, recently published data regarding secondary tumors associated with etoposide exposure should restrict its use to patients who absolutely require etoposide to achieve remission.
