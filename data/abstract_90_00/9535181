Mankind is faced by the increasing emergence of resistant pathogens, including cancer cells. An overview of the different strategies adopted by a variety of cells to evade chemotherapy is presented, with a focus on the mechanisms of multidrug transport. In particular, we analyze the yeast network for pleiotropic drug resistance and assess the potentiality of this system for further understanding of the mechanism of broad specificity and for development of novel practical applications.
