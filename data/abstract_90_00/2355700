Clinical and bacteriological studies were carried out to investigate the isolation of MRSA from sputa and 13 cases with bronchopulmonary infections due to MRSA, during 4 years from 1985 to 1988 at the Hokusyo Central Hospital. The isolation rate of MRSA in Staphylococcus aureus from sputum increased from 0% in 1985 to 51.4% in 1988, and especially from patients in wards for aged people. Most of the MRSA strains were isolated from patients with underlying diseases, or bed sores. The roentgenographic appearances in bronchopulmonary infection patients due to MRSA, showed infiltration and cavitation. Seven out of 13 cases of bronchopulmonary infection due to MRSA died, in spite of therapy with current antibiotics, suggesting poor prognosis of this infection.
