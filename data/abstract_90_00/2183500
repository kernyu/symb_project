The genetical basis of germ change especially for the gain of the resistance, and virulence plasmids have been treated not only with regard to clinical consequences but also have been classified in their evolutionary importance. Mechanisms of virulence have been illustrated on example of origin of siderophors, the increase of virulence through cytotoxical damage, on the obtained ability of adhesion and colonisation as well as by enhancement of equipment with enzyms. The patient with reduced resistance has been put out as selection condition.
