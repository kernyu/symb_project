Salicylate and related compounds, such as aspirin, have a variety of effects in eucaryotic systems and are well known for their medicinal properties. Salicylate also has numerous effects on bacteria, yet only a handful of individuals within the scientific community appreciate these findings. From a bacterial viewpoint, growth in the presence of salicylate can be both beneficial and detrimental. On one hand, growth of certain bacteria in the presence of salicylate can induce an intrinsic multiple antibiotic resistance phenotype. On the other hand, growth in the presence of salicylate can reduce the resistance to some antibiotics and affect virulence factor production in some bacteria. This review provides an overview of the effects salicylate has on various bacterial species.
