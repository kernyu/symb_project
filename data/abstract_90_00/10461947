A chloroquine-resistant strain of Plasmodium vivax (AMRU-1) from Papua New Guinea has been adapted to grow in 4 species of Aotus monkeys (Aotus lemurinus griseimembra, Aotus vaciferans, Aotus nancymai, and Aotus azarae boliviensis), hybrid Aotus monkeys, and Saimiri boliviensis monkeys. Whereas it was possible to infect Saimiri monkeys with this parasite by inoculation of parasitized erythrocytes, only 42% of Saimiri monkeys became infected, compared to 92% of Aotus monkeys attempted. Comparative mosquito feedings showed that only A. vociferans, A. l. griseimembra, and Saimiri boliviensis monkeys produced infections in mosquitoes. Oocysts were observed on the guts of the 4 species of mosquitoes used (Anopheles gambiae, Anopheles stephensi, Anopheles freeborni, and Anopheles dirus), but sporozoite transmission was effected only with the intravenous inoculation of sporozoites from An. dirus into an A. l. griseimembra monkey.
