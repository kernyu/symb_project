The aim of our investigation was to characterize better the possible changes in staphylococcal susceptibility to some antimicrobial agents. We considered the staphylococcal strains isolated between June 1986 and June 1989 and held responsible for proved bacterial infections. In this relatively short time we observed a moderate increase in methicillin resistance. Compared with methicillin-sensitive strains, methicillin-resistant isolates showed minor susceptibility to most antimicrobial agents; nevertheless, vancomycin, teicoplanin, cefamandole, imipenem, fluoroquinolones and netilmicin, according to our results, appear at present the most reliable antistaphylococcal antibiotics.
