Oncogenes discovered in retroviruses such as Rous sarcoma virus were generated by transduction of cellular proto-oncogenes into the viral genome. Several different kinds of junctions between the viral and proto-oncogene sequences have been found in different viruses. A system of retrovirus vectors and a protocol that mimicked this transduction during a single cycle of retrovirus replication was developed. The transduction involved the formation of a chimeric viral-cellular RNA, strand switching of the reverse transcription growing point from an infectious retrovirus to the chimeric RNA, and often a subsequent deletion during the rest of viral DNA synthesis. A short region of sequence identity was frequently used for the strand switching. The rate of this process was about 0.1 to 1 percent of the rate of homologous retroviral recombination.
