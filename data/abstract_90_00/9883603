According to the recent advances of molecular biological technics, some of the genetic mechanisms of drug-resistance of Mycobacteria has been uncovered. Generally, drug-resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was caused by point mutations in chromosomal gene. In isoniazid (INH) resistant M. tuberculosis, mutations and genetic deletions in catalase-peroxidase gene (katG), inhA gene, or alkyl hydroperoxide reductase gene were reported. On the other hand, mutations and other genetic alterations in RNA polymerase beta subunit gene (rpoB) were the major mechanisms of resistance to rifampicin (RFP) with high frequencies of 90% or more. Moreover, these genetic alterations in rpoB gene were suspected as the resistant mechanism to other rifamycin antituberculosis drugs, such as rifabutin. In addition, it was reported that point mutations in 16S rRNA gene (rrs) and ribosomal protein S12 gene (rpsL) induced M. tuberculosis as streptomycin (SM) resistant phenotype. Furthermore, nicotinamidase (pncA) gene, DNA gyrase A subunit (gyrA) gene, and embB gene were reported as the responsible gene to pyrazinamide-, quinolone- and ethambutol-resistance, respectively. Although all mechanisms of drug-resistance were still unclear, these information are very useful and helpful for development of rapid diagnosis system of drug-resistant M. tuberculosis.
