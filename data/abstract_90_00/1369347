Aureobasidium pullulans strain Y117 was transformed to hygromycin resistance using plasmid pDH33, which contains the bacterial hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene (hph) fused to promoter elements of the Aspergillus niger glucoamylase gene (glaA). Southern hybridizations of transformants revealed multiple, integrated copies of the vector. The glaA promoter was not induced by starch in A. pullulans as it is in A. niger; however, the transcriptional start points were the same in both species.
