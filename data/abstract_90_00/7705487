Molecular variation within and between plasmids of Salmonella enterica serotype Dublin was analysed. Such variation has been demonstrated in the serotype-specific plasmids (SSP's) of Typhimurium and Enteritidis. The two aims of this study were to determine the plasmid diversity in a host-adapted serotype and also the incidence of molecular variation in the SSP among strains of Dublin using restriction endonuclease fragmentation pattern (REFP) analysis with Pst1, Sma1 and EcoRV. Sixty-five strains were examined from seven countries. Plasmid profile and REFP analysis showed that none of the strains was plasmid-free. Seventy-seven percent of the strains possessed the 72 kb SSP either alone or in combination with another plasmid; 23% harboured plasmids which were molecular variants of the SSP. Four of the variants were more closely related to each other than to the reference SSP and were harboured by Dublin isolated from both the USA and Europe. A further three were shown to be cointegrate plasmids and were similarly distributed. Thirty-two percent of strains possessed the SSP alone. None of the UK strains was resistant to any of the antimicrobial agents tested whereas 74% of the remaining strains were resistant to between one and five antimicrobial agents. This study corroborates previous findings concerning the high degree of stability of the SSP and confirmed the clonal nature of Dublin. Co-resident plasmids provided evidence of sub-clones within localized geographical areas.
