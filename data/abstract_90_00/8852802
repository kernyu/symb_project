The study presented updates the spectrum of causative organisms in peritonsillar abscesses. Antibiotic treatment and surgery play important roles in this potentially life-threatening disease. A regular screening of the bacterial spectrum present and resistance remains important for optimizing a therapeutic regimen. Swabs of 122 peritonsillar abscesses were taken and investigated for the presence of causative organisms (bacteria and fungi) and potential antibiotic resistances. It was found that group A beta-hemolytic streptococci and Bacteroides spp. were the predominant isolates. It was also found that amoxicillin plus clavulinic acid or, alternatively, a third-generation cephalosporin (e.g., cefotaxime) represented the treatment of first choice to prevent antibiotic resistance.
