The clinical tolerance and biological properties of 6 x 10(6) IU of Chinese hamster glycosylated recombinant interferon-beta (rHuIFN-beta) and natural IFN-beta (Frone) given i.v. were compared in 12 healthy volunteers in a randomized cross-over, double-blind trial. All subjects received a single injection of each type of IFN-beta. Both were well tolerated and provoked similar changes in clinical indices. Serum neopterin (Np) values increased significantly from the 24th to 72nd h post-injection of rHuIFN-beta and Frone. beta 2-Microglobulin (beta 2-M) serum levels were statistically above baseline 24-96 h after rHuIFN-beta, and from the 24th to the 120th h with Frone. Both IFNs provoked a rise in intracellular 2',5'-adenylate (2-5A) levels from the 10th to the 48th h, as well as in Hu-Mx synthesis, which was significant from the 10th to the 96th h. Serum levels of 2-5A, interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) remained unchanged. There were no statistical differences in the changes provoked by the two differently derived IFN-beta in any of the biological parameters studied. Overall, the results of this study indicate that rHuIFN-beta and Frone have similar pharmacodynamics.
