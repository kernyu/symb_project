The presence of the alpha-haemolysin secretion genes sensitizes Escherichia coli to vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic that is normally excluded from the Gram-negative envelope (owing to its large size) (M(r) 1400). The selection of vancomycin mutants in strains carrying such genes was found to be a very powerful method for selecting non-haemolytic mutants. In this way, mutations in the known secretion genes, hlyB, hlyD and tolC, were obtained. However additional mutations mapped in genes rfaH and galU which are required for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis. Mutations in rfaH and galU strongly reduced alpha-haemolysin secretion as well as the secretion of Erwinia chrysanthemi proteases in E. coli without affecting their synthesis. These mutations markedly lowered the content of TolC protein, required for haemolysin secretion and also of the PrtF protein necessary for protease secretion. These results raise the possibility that LPS is involved in the correct incorporation of the TolC and PrtF proteins into the cell envelope.
