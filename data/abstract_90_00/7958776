Two Cryptococcus neoformans strains isolated from an AIDS patient were investigated, a pretreatment isolate (CN1) and a second isolate (CN3) following failure of fluconazole and amphotericin B treatment. No difference in fluconazole sensitivity, but relative resistance to amphotericin B was observed for CN3. The sterol composition of CN3 indicated a defect in sterol delta 8-->7 isomerase in this strain and depletion of ergosterol, the major sterol of the CN1.
