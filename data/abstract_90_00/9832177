Apolipoprotein E (apoE) has an essential role in lipoprotein metabolism, but recent studies have also revealed other functions associated with it, eg, neurologic and malignant diseases. We studied the association between apoE phenotypes E2/3, E3/3, and E4/3 and blood pressure after adjustment for covariates, as well as the association between phenotypes and adjusted plasma glucose and insulin levels in the standard oral glucose tolerance test in a random middle-aged population-based cohort of 259 men and 267 women. Systolic blood pressure was associated with apoE phenotype in the men with moderate or heavy alcohol consumption (>115 g/week), the mean systolic blood pressure value being 16 mm Hg higher in the E2/3 and 11 mm Hg higher in the E3/3 phenotypes than in the E4/3 phenotype, P = .04. No association was seen in occasional drinkers or teetotalers (lowest tertile <24 g/week), whereas in the middle tertile the association was intermediate. The same association was seen with diastolic blood pressure. In men, there was a significant correlation between systolic blood pressure and alcohol consumption in the E2/3 phenotype (rs = 0.71, P < .01) and in the E3/3 phenotype (rs = 0.25, P < .01), but not in the E4/3 phenotype (rs = 0.03, NS). No association between apoE phenotypes and insulin resistance was observed. In conclusion, in middle-aged men, apoE phenotype significantly influences the blood-pressure-increasing effect of alcohol consumption. This gene environment interaction may have marked implications for the prevention and treatment of hypertension.
