PURPOSE: To identify clinical and biological features of subacute falciparum malaria, risk factors, and to evaluate the efficacy of curative treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Diagnostic criteria were the association of apyrexia, anemia, little or no parasitemia and a high titer of anti-Plasmodium antibodies. Forty-three cases were observed in subjects returning from chloroquine-resistant areas in Africa. They were matched with controls for age, country of residence and duration of stay. Controls were missionaries who attended our unit for a routine medical check-up during the study period. RESULTS: The clinical presentation and biological features were similar to "malarial cachexia", a condition mainly described in non-immune children in endemic areas. Splenomegaly was present in 58% of the patients. Biological features included little or no parasitemia, an overall decrease in the blood cell count, an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate and a high titer of anti-Plasmodium antibodies. This syndrome was not correlated with the frequency of chloroquine resistance, the area of stay (urban or rural) or to the kind of chemoprophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes subacute resistant falciparum malaria in patients who had prolonged stay in chloroquine-resistant areas of Africa associating splenomegaly, cytopenia and a low or absent parasitemia. Subacute chloroquine-resistant malaria could be due to host factors which remained to be determined by prospective immunological studies. Curative treatment with mefloquine is effective.
