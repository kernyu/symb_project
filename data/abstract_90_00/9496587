Tuberculosis is once more a subject of world wide preoccupation; since 1985 a disturbing recrudescence of this disease has been noted in numerous countries related to population growth and the worsening of poverty in those countries without natural resources, and disadvantaged groups living on the margins of society in rich countries, along with the occurrence of an epidemic of HIV (VIH). In numerous developed countries where tuberculosis no longer represents a public health problem, the care services have little by little been closed or re-orientated and the principles of treatment of tuberculosis have been forgotten. The direct consequence of this has often been inadequate treatment and its corollary: the emergence of strains multiresistant to Isoniazid and Rifampicin. If the current epidemiological tendencies are confirmed and no supplementary action is taken, the WHO (OMS) has estimated that during the ten years between 1990 and the millennium there will be 88 million new cases of tuberculosis and 30 million people will die of tuberculosis. However the tendencies can be reversed and tuberculosis could still be eliminated. The struggle against tuberculosis is a world wide emergency and the hope of controlling the situation before an increase in multiresistant strains which would render the trend irreversible, rests on a general application of correct and coherent national programmes. Such a programme as the UICTMR model had already been carried out as has the proof of their efficacy.
