During the 12-month period ending December 1990, urological infections due to MRSA were found 18 patients (14 hospitalized and 4 outpatients) and clinical features of these cases were reviewed. Ten patients with MRSA in the urine were asymptomatic, but MRSA sepsis due to severe pyelonephritis occurred in one patient and extensive treatment was required. Factors contributing to MRSA infections were mainly indwelling catheterization, preceding antimicrobial therapy (new quinolones and new cephems), and obstructive disease. Strict management of indwelling catheters and drainage of wounds is especially important, because MRSA infections are considered to be nosocomial.
