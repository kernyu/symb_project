Strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (268 in toto) isolated from different infected sites in patients were serotyped, their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were determined, and the laboratory data were correlated with clinical information. The distribution pattern of serogroups and serotypes was different in paediatric patients (< 18 years old) when compared with that of adults. Overall, 91% of the strains were represented in a 23-valent vaccine. Only eight patients received pneumococcal vaccine before infection, and only 18 strains (6.7%) were moderately susceptible or resistant to one or more of the antimicrobial agents tested. Five strains were moderately susceptible to penicillin G, and not one was fully resistant.
