In the present study the cross-resistance rates of cefoxitin-resistant and cefoxitin-susceptible strains of the Bacteroides fragilis group were compared with regard to beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations and clindamycin. Piperacillin-tazobactam was the most active agent tested with an overall resistance rate of 0.2% and no resistance among cefoxitin-resistant strains. Ticarcillin-clavulanate was the least active combination with an overall resistance rate of 1.6% but a resistance rate of 13.1% among cefoxitin-resistant strains. For ampicillin-sulbactam, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and clindamycin resistance, rates of cefoxitin-resistant versus cefoxitin-susceptible strains were 9.1% and 0.4%, 8.3% and 0.9%, and 28% and 12.9%, respectively.
