In the present study, we investigated the ability of epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and insulin to protect the human breast cancer cell line MDA-231 from death induced by the antitumor drug actinomycin D (ACT-D). ACT-D is an inhibitor of RNA and protein synthesis, and its cytotoxicity may result due to continuous depletion in some vital protein molecules. Cell death was induced in the MDA-231 cells by either continuous exposure to a low dose of ACT-D (0.2 microgram/ml), or by a short-time exposure to a high dose of ACT-D (2 micrograms/ml) and further culturing in the absence of the drug. Cell death was evaluated by the trypan blue dye exclusion test, the release of lactic dehydrogenase into the culture medium, and the depletion in the cellular ATP content. EGF and IGF-1, each at an optimal concentration of 20 ng/ml, enhanced substantially survival of cells exposed either to a low or a high dose of ACT-D. The combination of EGF (10 ng/ml) and IGF-1 (10 ng/ml) had an additive survival effect, which proposes that each of the growth factors enhanced survival by a distinct pathway. Insulin up to 40 ng/ml had no effect on cell survival. Pretreatment of the cells for 1 to 5 h with EGF and IGF-1 protected cells from the cytotoxic effect of ACT-D. Exposure of the cells to 2 micrograms/ml of ACT-D for 1 h resulted in a drastic inhibition in uridine incorporation and only in a slight inhibition in leucine incorporation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
