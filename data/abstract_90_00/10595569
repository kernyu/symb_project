The main object of this study was to describe the features of antibiotic resistance in pneumococci from children in four regions of France in 1995. Despite the high prevalence (40%) of pneumococci with diminished susceptibilty to penicillin (PDSP), resistance to amoxycillin (0.8%) and cefotaxime (0.4%) was rare; 16% of pneumococci were resistant to penicillin G (PRP, MIC > 1 mg/l). PDSP showed the expected resistance to macrolides (67%) and cotrimoxazole (57%) and were predominantly serotypes 23F, 14, 9 and 6. This study by the Regional Pneumococcal Observatories confirms the high prevalence and the main characteristics of antibiotic resistance among pneumococci isolated from children. Nevertheless, the resistance to all antibiotics was lower than that found in French multicentre, nationwide surveys, possibly because of differences in the mode of strain collection and geographic origin.
