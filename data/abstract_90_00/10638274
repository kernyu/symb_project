The personally experienced development of chemotherapy for tuberculosis during the last half century represents some highlights of new knowledges and practical successes: the discovery of antituberculosis drugs; the comprehension of their actions and side effects; the exploration of mechanisms of resistance against antituberculosis agents; the evaluation of therapeutic and epidemiologic consequences of resistant strains; the decoding of the mycobacterial genetic structure. For different economic, social and psychologic reasons, the worldwide results of the battle against tuberculosis are not nearly as good as possible. AIDS is only a partial factor of this failure.
