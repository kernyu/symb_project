The in vitro activity of meropenem was compared with imipenem and other selected antimicrobial agents against 115 isolates from the family Vibrionaceae. No resistance was observed with meropenem or imipenem against these isolates. However, meropenem was generally four- to 16-fold more active than imipenem against the aeromonads and Vibrio cholerae. Meropenem showed excellent in vitro activity against the Vibrionaceae and may be useful for eradicating infections produced by these organisms.
