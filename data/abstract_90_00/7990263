We carried out clinical and bacteriological studies on sultamicillin (SBTPC) in pediatric sinusitis at 10 general practice settings. The results are summarized as follows. 1. The major isolated organisms from purulent nasal discharges were Streptococcus pneumoniae 27.5%, Haemophilus influenzae 32.4% and Moraxella catarrhalis 9.9%. Similar results were observed for the major isolates from nasopharynx. 2. 33% of the isolated S. pneumoniae were penicillin-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP) against which the MICs were equal to or higher than 0.1 microgram/ml. 3. PISP was isolated from 14% of all cases. 4. The clinical efficacy rate was 77.5% and was deemed satisfactory. 5. In the bacteriological study, persistence rate of PISP was 38.5% among the PISP from purulent nasal discharge and 60.0% among the PISP from nasopharynx which and these values were significantly higher than persistence rates of PSSP, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. 6. Adverse reactions were observed in 21.5% of all cases, involving diarrhea and loose stool.
