In the early 1980's methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was reported as a major pathogenic organism of geriatric hospital infection in Japan. At the same time in our geriatric wards, including 190 beds, MRSA infection was prevalent. In the early 1980's in our geriatric wards minocycline was one of the most sensitive antibiotics to MRSA isolated in our wards and used frequently against MRSA pneumonias and bacteremia. In the late 1980's resistant strains of MRSA to minocycline rapidly increased because vancomycin was not allowed to introduced for treatment of MRSA before 1991 in Japan. At the same period the predominant coagulase type changed from type II to type VII. To decrease minocycline-resistant strains to MRSA after 1987, use of minocycline was limited. Moreover since Oct. 1991 to decrease nosocomial infections some active preventive measures against hospital infection, including limited use of 2nd and 3rd cephems, were taken. In this study changing patterns of coagulase type of Staphylococcus aureus were discussed. At least 4 years was needed to find out that the predominant coagulase type changed from type VII to type II again in 1991. In this study about 22 antimicrobial agents MICs of 313 strains of Staphylococcus aureus isolated between March 1992 and June 1993 were determined and compared with the data of MICs before introduction of preventive measures. The pattern of susceptibility to MINO was in part improved. Thus the some sensitive strains of S. aureus were observed again in our geriatric wards. Interestingly indeed it took approximately 5 years to find out the emergence of sensitive strains to MINO since limitation of use of MINO in 1987.
