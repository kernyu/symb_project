Clinico-laboratory estimation of the efficacy and tolerance of ofloxacin used in succession, at first intravenously and then orally, in the treatment of 15 patients with infection of the abdominal cavity was performed. It was shown that after the use for a period of 10 years ofloxacin preserved its high antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms with multiple drug resistance and remained superior to the majority of broad spectrum antimicrobial agents by the number of susceptible isolates. The successive use of ofloxacin proved to be highly efficient. The total efficacy of the drug amounted to 80 percent and no side effects were recorded. The analysis of the microbiological state of the antiinfectious resistance system (AIRS) showed that the dysbiotic lesions on the mucosa of the upper respiratory tracts and large intestine detected in all the patients before the treatment with ofloxacin remained after the treatment. However, a change in the microflora responsible for dysbacteriosis was observed. The investigation of the immunological status of the AIRS suggested that the good and satisfactory results of the therapy with ofloxacin could to a significant extent be due to the proportion of the active neutrophils.
