We tested 23 clinical isolates of acyclovir-susceptible, acyclovir-resistant, and foscarnet-resistant herpes simplex virus for susceptibility to penciclovir. Isolates showed cross-resistance to penciclovir and acyclovir, but penciclovir retained a relative activity against foscarnet-resistant isolates. Its clinical utility for the treatment of resistant herpes simplex virus infections remains to be studied.
