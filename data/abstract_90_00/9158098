Chloroquine is widely used as self-medication for presumptive treatment of malaria despite the existence of parasite resistance to the drug. Recent studies suggest that tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) overproduction probably has a causal association with poor outcome in cerebral malaria. In addition, chloroquine has been shown to have inhibitory action on TNF-alpha synthesis. The present study aimed at evaluating chloroquine/TNF-alpha interaction in 90 children hospitalized for severe malaria in a malaria-endemic zone. TNF-alpha and chloroquine varied in the same range on admission, but there was an inverse correlation between the two: the higher the chloroquine level, the lower the TNF-alpha level. Parasite resistance to chloroquine in vitro was high. The clinical course in the patients was uneventful, save for two fatal cases and one survivor with neurological sequela. The above data suggest beneficial effects of chloroquine self-medication with respect to anti-TNF-alpha action. Rational use of this tool should be encouraged.
