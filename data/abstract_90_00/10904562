From July 1, 1994 to June 30, 1996, 394 children with Nontyphoidal Salmonella diarrhea were studied at Bamrasnaradura Infectious Disease Hospital in Thailand. The ages ranged from 1 month to 12 years (mean, 1.4 years). Eighty-seven per cent of patients were in the first 2 years of life. Diarrhea, mostly acute with watery stool and fever were the most common presenting symptoms. The duration of diarrhea ranged from 1 to 20 days (mean, 5.2 days). Salmonella group B was the most common serogroup (56.1%). Most isolates were multiresistant strains, however, they were all sensitive to norfloxacin. Four (1%) patients were HIV-infected. Pneumonia found in 2 patients (0.5%) and septicemia in 1 patient (0.3%). None of the patients died. We conclude that nontyphoidal Salmonella diarrhea in children is still endemic in Thailand, especially among infants and high multidrug resistance occurs.
