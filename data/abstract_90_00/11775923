OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical characteristics of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) pulmonary disease. METHODS: Ninety-six out of 173 cases with NTM pulmonary disease diagnosed through identification of mycobacterium strains isolated from 5,592 sputum acid-fast staining positive cases from 1981-1996 were selected, and a retrospective analysis was made. RESULTS: According to Runyon classification, there were 14 cases with M. kansasii and 1 with M. marinum in type I, 4 with M. scrofulsceum in type II, 23 with M. intracellulare or M. avium in type III, 24 with M. chelonae and 30 with M. fortuitumin in type IV. Cases whose courses of disease were more than 10 years accounted for 31%. Main clinical symptoms included cough (78%), expectoration (71%), haemoptysis (58%) and fever (26%). Fifty-seven percent cases in X-ray chest film were seen lesions bilaterally, 42% in one side, 27% in the right and 15% in the left. One percent showed no obvious lesion in X-ray chest film. Excluding one case with incomplete data, the total resistance rate of NTM was 96% in other 95 cases, 93% in type I, 50%, 100% and 100% in type II, III, IV respectively. After antituberculous chemotherapy, sputum negative conversion was seen in 14 of 15 cases with type I NTM, 6 of 23 with type III and 14 of 54 with type IV, while definite data in 4 cases with type II were not available. CONCLUSIONS: NTM pulmonary disease is characterized by long course of disease, nonspecific symptoms, high resistance rate and unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy.
