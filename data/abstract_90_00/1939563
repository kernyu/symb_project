Ciprofloxacin was subjected to a multilaboratory study designed to determine its in vitro susceptibility criteria for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and its quality control parameters for both agar dilution and disk diffusion susceptibility testing for this species. All clinical isolates were susceptible, i.e., MICs were less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml and zones of inhibition were greater than or equal to 36 mm. A resistant category could not be defined, but in vitro-selected mutants gave zones of less than or equal to 35 mm, and MICs for these strains were greater than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml. For quality control of ciprofloxacin agar dilution tests on supplemented GC agar, MICs for Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 ranged from 0.12 to 0.5 microgram/ml. For quality control of 5-micrograms ciprofloxacin disk tests, N. gonorrhoeae ATCC 49226 and S. aureus ATCC 25923 produced acceptable zone diameter ranges of 48 to 58 mm and 22 to 26 mm, respectively.
