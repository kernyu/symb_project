A review of the published literature over the period 1978-1993 was undertaken to assess any changes in the prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing bacterial pathogens and also any changes in the susceptibility in these pathogens to amoxycillin/clavulanate. The review has involved the examination of over 1500 publications. The review shows that in general there has been an increase in the frequency of beta-lactamase-producing pathogens resistant to ampicillin and amoxycillin but there is no evidence for any significant increase in resistance to amoxycillin/clavulanate over the period of the review.
