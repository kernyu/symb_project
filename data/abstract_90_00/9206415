Actinomyces israelii has been repeatedly implicated as a cause of failure of endodontic therapy. This study investigated the antimicrobial effect of antibiotics as well as intracanal medicaments, sodium hypochlorite solution and calcium hydroxide, on this important pathogen. Growth of A. israelii was inhibited by low concentrations of antibiotics, yet high concentrations were not bactericidal for A. israelii over 1 week. When A. israelii was exposed for 2-6 weeks at concentrations equivalent to clinical serum levels, the antibiotics were lethal. The results reveal a species-specific antibiotic tolerance for A. israelii. Both sodium hypochlorite solution and calcium hydroxide were found to be highly effective in killing A. israelii.
