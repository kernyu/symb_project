Two genes encoding capreomycin (Cp)-modifying enzymes have been isolated from the producing organism Streptomyces capreolus. Cp acetyltransferase (CAC), encoded by cac, is active against all four components of the Cp complex, whereas Cp phosphotransferase (CPH), the product of cph, is active against Cp components IA and IIA (and also the related antibiotic, Vm) but not against Cp IB or Cp IIB.
