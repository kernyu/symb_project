The hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) gene, under control of the inducible mouse metallothionein I gene promoter, was inserted in an expression vector based on the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). This vector was introduced into human cells by DNA transfection and clones were selected for their resistance to hygromycin B. The recombinant EBV vector replicates efficiently as an episome in human cells and approximately six copies per cell were found in one clone of hygromycin-B-resistant cells. These cells produce high levels of HBsAg in the presence of metals. The protein is mainly found in the cell medium, suggesting that the HBsAg is secreted from the cells.
