For each year from 1986 to 1990, fourteen private laboratories from all over France collected epidemiological data on germs discovered in urinary infections in France. This retrospective and comparative study covers 5,398 dossiers. The sensitivity of germs in private practice in urinary infections (ampicillin, AM-AC, cephalosporin, ceftriaxone, gentamicin, pipemidic acid, pefloxacin, cotrimoxazol) were analysed. Germ resistance tests carried out by the CMI study in the centre of reference (Pr Thabaut, HIA Begin) showed variable divergences according to the different antibiogram techniques employed by the private laboratories.
