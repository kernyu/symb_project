RP 59500, a mixture of two semisynthetic streptogramin antibiotics (quinupristin and dalfopristin), is one of a few investigational agents currently in clinical trials with inhibitory activity against multiple-drug-resistant strains of Enterococcus faecium. We evaluated the bactericidal activity of this antimicrobial against 30 recent clinical isolates of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, including 23 erythromycin-resistant (MIC, >256 microg/ml) and 7 erythromycin-intermediate (MIC, 2 to 4 microg/ml) strains. All isolates were inhibited by RP 59500 at 0.25 to 1.0 microg/ml. The bactericidal activity of RP 59500 was markedly influenced by the erythromycin susceptibility of the strains and by several technical factors, such as inoculum growth phase and time of incubation of counting plates. As determined by time-kill methods, RP 59500 at a concentration of 2 or 8 microg/ml failed to kill erythromycin-resistant organisms under any conditions. Bactericidal activity was observed against all seven erythromycin-intermediate isolates when log-phase inocula were used and the cells were counted after 48 h of incubation (mean reductions in viable bacteria for RP 59500 at concentrations of 2 and 8 microg/ml, 3.45 and 3.50 log10 CFU/ml, respectively), but killing was diminished when the plates were examined at 72 h (mean killing, 3.06 and 2.95 log10, CFU/ml, respectively). No bactericidal activity was observed when stationary-phase cultures were used. On the basis of these data, we expect that bactericidal activity of RP 59500 against the multiple-drug-resistant E. faecium strains currently encountered would be distinctly uncommon.
