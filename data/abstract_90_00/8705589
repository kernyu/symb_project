Persistent mucocutaneous ulcers in AIDS represent a variety of disease entities. The purpose of this study was to characterize clinicopathologic features of persistent oral ulcers associated with cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus in AIDS. Forty-seven persons infected with HIV with persistent ulcers (mean, 2.4 ulcers/person) were included in this study. A biopsy specimen from a representative ulcer was taken from each patient. Hematoxylin-eosin, periodic acid-Schiff, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus immunocytochemical stains were performed on tissue sections. The most common sites of involvement were the buccal/labial mucosa (27%), tongue (25%), and gingiva (18%). Mean ulcer size was 1.8 cm with a mean duration of 5.6 weeks. The ulcerogenic viral agents were cytomegalovirus alone in 53% of cases, cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus coinfection in 28% of cases, and herpes simplex virus alone in 19% of cases. Treatment response to ganciclovir with or without topical steroids resulted in lesion resolution in the cytomegalovirus and cytomegalovirus/herpes simplex virus groups; however, recurrence/resistance was relatively high (23%). Herpes simplex virus/cytomegalovirus ulcers responded to oral acyclovir in combination with systemic ganciclovir. Increasing the oral acyclovir dosage resulted in resolution of herpes simplex virus-only ulcers in all but one case. Cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus are associated with persistent mucocutaneous ulcers in AIDS. These lesions responded to systemic antiviral therapy but are difficult to differentiate from other ulcerogenic diseases such as aphthous major, necrotizing stomatitis, and ulcerations not otherwise specified without biopsy and histopathologic examination.
