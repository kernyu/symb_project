Seventy-six Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from various lesions of horses were characterized. All of the 76 strains were identified as biotypes B (38.2%) and C (61.8%). Of 55 strains tested, 42 (76.4%) were differentiated into 7 coagulase types. Coagulase types V and VII were predominant in the metritis strains. Coagulase type II was found most frequently in the strains from phlegmon, dermatitis, sinusitis, empyema sinus, and nasal catarrh. Forty-two (55.3%) of the 76 strains were differentiated into 24 phage patterns. Twenty (58.8%) of 34 typable strains from metritis were lysed by the human group I phage 52, and group II phages 3A, 3C, 55 and 71. Forty-five (59.2%) of the 76 strains were resistant to 1 or more of 6 antibiotics. Strains resistant to penicillin G, irrespective of source, were most frequent (95.6%). Forty (93.0%) of 43 strains resistant to penicillin G alone or in combination with other antibiotics produced beta-lactamase. Only 8 (10.5%) of the 76 strains produced enterotoxins A (n = 2), B (n = 1) or C (n = 5), and they all were isolated from metritis. Only 1 strain isolated from phlegmon and 2 from metritis produced exfoliative toxin (ET) and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1), respectively. The latter 2 strains also produced enterotoxin C. The results of the present study showed the first evidence of the presence of both ET- and TSST-1-producing S. aureus isolated from horses.
