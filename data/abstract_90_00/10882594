In 1996, a population-based surveillance program for invasive adult group B streptococcal (GBS) diseases in Canada was undertaken, to define the epidemiologic and microbiologic characteristics of the disease. Nine public health units across Canada, representing 9.6% of the population, participated in the program. In total, 106 culture-positive cases of invasive adult GBS disease were reported, which represented an incidence rate 4.6 per 100,000 adults (41/100, 000 for pregnant and 4.1/100,000 for nonpregnant adults). Sixty-two (58.5%) of the 106 cases occurred in females, and, of these, 15 (14. 2%) were associated with pregnancy. Serotype V was the most common, accounting for 31% of the 90 GBS isolates typed (26.7% of nonpregnant and 4.4% of pregnant cases). This was followed by serotypes III (19%), Ia (17%), Ib (10%), II (9%), and VII (1%). Thirteen percent were nontypeable. All isolates were susceptible to penicillin, ampicillin, and vancomycin. Resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin was 6.7% and 4.4%, respectively.
