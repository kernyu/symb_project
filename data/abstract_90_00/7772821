A 3.2-kb DNA fragment of the carbomycin biosynthetic region including the 3-O-acyltransferase gene (acyA) from Streptomyces thermotolerans was sequenced, and four ORFs were found in the fragment. The second ORF, designated ORF-A, was transcribed in the opposite direction to the other three ORFs. The first ORF was identified as carA, a gene for carbomycin resistance. The amino acid sequence of ORF-A was homologous to proteins of the cytochrome P-450 family. Streptomyces lividans transformed with pCB20, in which ORF-A was subcloned, epoxidized carbomycin B at its C-12, 13 positions, thus producing carbomycin A. The third ORF, the amino acid sequence of which showed a homology to macrolide antibiotics O-acyltransferases was identified as acyA. The last ORF (ORF-B), which starts just 3 bp downstream from the TGA termination codon of acyA, was thought to be a carbomycin 4-O-methyltransferase gene, because the amino acid sequence deduced from ORF-B showed high homology to a putative midecamycin 4-O-methyltransferase encoded on mdmC.
