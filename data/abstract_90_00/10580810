Using congenic strains of mice susceptible (bcg(s)) or resistant (bcg(r)) to BCG, murine microglial cell lines, RR4.R (BCG-resistant) and RR8.S (BCG-susceptible), were established in vitro. Comparative studies revealed that, although phagocytic to a similar extent, RR4.R cells were more active than RR8.S cells in terms of antimycobacterial activity. Interestingly, cells of resistant genotype secreted more nitric oxide, TNF-alpha and IL-12, but less IL-6, than susceptible cells, when stimulated with IFN-gamma alone or in combination with lipopolysaccharide. Nevertheless, no significant differences were observed between the two cell lines in terms of IL-1 beta or IL-10 secretion, or on assessment of cytokine production following exposure to a massive dose of lipopolysaccharide. Overall, these data provide the first evidence that resistant/susceptible genotype influences antimycobacterial activity, NO and cytokine production in microglial cells, the prototype of cerebral macrophages.
