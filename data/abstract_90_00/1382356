Resistant variants of HSV-1 wt strain to ACV, CC, DHPG and PFA can be selected after several passages in drug-containing cultures. The degree of resistance of different variants varied and emerged at different times. The combination of antiviral agents can delay and even prevent the emergence of drug-resistant variants. At the same time, the concentration, dose and, therefore, toxicity of the antiviral agents can also be reduced. So, it is a feasible method for treating resistant HSV infections. Cross-sensitivity tests showed that ACVr variants are resistant to ACV, DHPG and PFA, but sensitive to CC; PFAr variants are sensitive to ACV, CC and DHPG; CCr variants are sensitive to ACV and DHPG, but resistant to PFA; DHPGr variants are sensitive to ACV, CC and PFA. These results suggest that the study of cross-sensitivity of HSV strains in vitro provide information which will aid the design of suitable therapy for drug-resistant HSV infections.
