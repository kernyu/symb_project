The sensitivity of haemophilus strains isolated from patients freshly were tested by newly produced fluorokinolones with broader antimicrobial activity and excellent pharmacokinetic features. We found a high sensitivity of all haemophilus strains tested by ofloxacin with Resistest method. The minimal inhibitory concentrations in Levinthal bouillon medium ranged between 0,015-0,03 micrograms/ml and the exerted a bactericidal effect. Since these concentrations are only a small portion of the blood and tissue levels of the ofloxacin, therefore the fluorokinolones proved to be effective antibacterial drugs in the therapy of the haemophilus infections.
