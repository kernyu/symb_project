The Progressive Diagnostics Manufacturers epsilometer test (E test; AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden), a quantitative variant of the disk diffusion technique, was evaluated comparatively to an agar dilution method for the antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Helicobacter pylori. A collection of 79 H. pylori clinical strains, including isolates with known resistance to various antimicrobial agents, was tested against 12 different antimicrobial agents. All strains were tested on Columbia agar supplemented with 10% horse blood. Plates were incubated at 37 degrees C in microaerobic atmosphere (5% O2, 10% CO2), and readings were done after 3 days of incubation. In general, E test MICs were easy to interpret and the correlation between MICs by the agar dilution method and the E test was good, with 86 and 99.5% of results being within, respectively, 1 and 2 log2 dilution steps in a total of 936 tests. All strains of H. pylori with documented resistance to the tested agents were detected by the E test. Thus, the E test appears to be an easy and reliable method for determination of MICs of antibiotics for H. pylori, and it may offer an interesting alternative to MIC determination by the agar dilution technique.
