BACKGROUND: Data on overall consumption of antibacterials are an important basis for measures against antibiotic resistance. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Salesdata of antibacterials (ATC group J01) for systemic use was collected from all hospitals in Norway for the year 1998. The sale to hospitals was subtracted from the total sale of antibacterials in Norway and the consumption for outpatient settings was estimated. RESULTS: The total use of antibacterials for systemic use in Norway was 14.4 DDD/1,000 inhabitants/day in 1998, which has been regarded as low. The use of antibacterials in hospitals was 7.5% of the total market, i.e. 1.09 DDD/1,000 inhabitants/day. The estimated use in ambulatory practice was 13.3 DDD/1,000 inhabitants/day. Different consumption patterns in the two settings were observed. The penicillins comprised around half of the antibacterials in both settings although the use of beta-laktamase sensitive penicillins represented a higher fraction in the outpatient setting. Cephalosporins represented 16% of the use of antibacterials in hospitals while the tetracyclines are the second most used antibacterial group outside hospitals. The use of newer broad spectrum antibacterials such as the quinolones are now increasing in Norway both inside and outside hospitals. INTERPRETATION: Relatively high consumption of penicillins supports the assumption that antibacterial resistance is low in Norway. It is, however, important to continue to follow the consumption of antibacterials in order to detect a potential negative trend early and instigate efforts like information, to possibly change the trend. It also offers the potential of measuring effects of legislative changes and informational efforts as well as defining the need for further investigation of drug therapy traditions.
