The in vitro activity of flurithromycin, a 14-membered macrolide drug, was found to be similar to that of erythromycin against 41 strains of Mycoplasma spp. and 100 strains of Ureaplasma urealyticum. All 28 strains of Mycoplasma hominis were uniformly resistant to both macrolides with MICs > 256 mg/L, U. urealyticum showed intermediate resistance with MIC50s of 0.5 and 1 mg/L for erythromycin and flurithromycin, respectively, whereas the ten strains of Mycoplasma pneumonia were susceptible to < or = 0.03 mg/L of both macrolides.
