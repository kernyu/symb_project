A Glucoprotamin based disinfectant was tested against different strains of atypical mycobacteria in a suspension test. The disinfectant showed maximum detectable kill (> 4 log reduction factor) against all strains tested at 2500 ppm Glucoprotamin within 15 min, except for a glutaraldehyde resistant strain of Mycobacterium chelonae. For the latter, 2500 ppm for 60 min or 5000 ppm for 15 min, were necessary to achieve maximum kill. The glutaraldehyde resistant strain was also resistant to a mixture of different aldehydes.
