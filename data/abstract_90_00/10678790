Surgical infections include a variety of entities such as secondary peritonitis, intra-abdominal abscesses, obstetric and gynecological infections as well as bone-joint and soft-tissue infections. By definition the term "surgical infection" implies that surgery itself plays the major role in therapy, while antimicrobial chemotherapy is only supplementary. Broad-spectrum empirical regimens employed include the combination of a 1st or 2nd generation cephalosporin plus clindamycin or metronidazole +/- aminoglycoside (depending on the severity of the condition). Cefepime and cefpirome are new 4th generation parenteral cephalosporins with a spectrum of activity which makes them suitable for the treatment of infections caused by a wide variety of bacteria. They are active against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, including Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with activity comparable to or greater than that of cefotaxime or ceftazidime respectively. Cefepime in particular is also very active against strains of Enterobacter and Pseudomonas spp resistant to these two agents. In comparison with 3rd generation cephalosporins, cefepime appears to be less likely to induce resistance, due to a lower rate of hydrolysis by beta-lactamases, a low affinity for these enzymes and more rapid permeation into the cell. Despite the fact that a 4th generation cephalosporin is well-suited for the treatment of polymicrobial infections, the following should be kept in mind: (I) MRSA strains and Bacteroides fragilis group are not included in their spectrum of activity. (II) Cefpirome is the only cephalosporin with in vitro activity against Enterococci. (III) Severe surgical infections of nosocomial origin, and particularly in settings where Enterobacter spp predominate, represent the major indication for empirical use of a 4th generation cephalosporin in combination with a nitroimidazole.
