An isolate of Salmonella enteritidis was found to produce a plasmid-encoded beta-lactamase (DHA-1) that conferred resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins and cephamycins. The substrate and inhibition profiles of this enzyme resemble a class C beta-lactamase. This is the first report of a plasmid-mediated cephalosporinase of this class in the Salmonella genus.
