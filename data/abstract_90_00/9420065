The in vitro susceptibility of 14 European Chlamydia psittaci strains from turkeys to the antibiotics doxycycline and enrofloxacin was tested. For doxycycline the MIC ranged from 0.05 to 0.2 microg/ml, with an average of 0.1 microg/ml. For enrofloxacin the MIC was 0.25 microg/ml. Acquired resistance was not detected against doxycycline and enrofloxacin.
