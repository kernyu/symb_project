The fact that M. tuberculosis develops resistance to anti-tuberculosis drugs has been known since the introduction of chemotherapy in 1952. Resistance has been reported to various drugs in India. Several factors pertaining to patients, physicians and environment are responsible for this. Clinical presentation of drug resistant tuberculosis is not different from drug responsive tuberculosis in children. Management of multi-drug resistant (MDR) tuberculosis is difficult and frustrating. Several second line drugs are being used. It is important to prevent this condition by adequate treatment of routine cases of tuberculosis and their contacts by directly observed therapy short course (DOTS).
