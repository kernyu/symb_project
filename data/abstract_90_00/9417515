In vitro susceptibility to fluconazole of Candida species isolated from 83 HIV-infected patients treated with fluconazole because of recurrent Candida stomatitis was monitored over a period of two years. A microdilution assay with high-resolution antifungal assay (HR) medium and RPMI 1640-medium were compared. In vitro less susceptible and fluconazole resistant C. species were observed in 23 patient at the end of the study. The Candida isolates recovered from oral rinsing fluids at the beginning and the end of study were tested for crossresistance to itraconazole and ketoconazole. Susceptibility to ketoconazole and to itraconazole was reduced using RPMI 1640-medium. Susceptibility of the isolates to fluconazole was not influenced by the assay medium. In 21 patients in vitro fluconazole resistant or less susceptible C. albicans were observed. 9 of 21 isolates showed crossresistance to itroconazole and ketoconazole, in 10 isolates only crossresistance to itraconazole was observed. During fluconazole treatment double infections due to combination of C. albicans and C. glabrata or C. krusei increased from 20% to 78% C. krusei was resistant to the three azoles. C. glabrata was less susceptible (4-8 mg/l) or resistant (> 8 mg/l) to fluconazole and resistant to itraconazole and ketoconazole High dosed intravenous fluconazole treatment with 400 to 600 mg daily failed in 11 patients with fluconazole resistant C. albicans and in 3 (3/10) patients with les susceptible C. albicans isolates.
