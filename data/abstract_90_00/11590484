PURPOSE: In this study, our purpose was to assess the efficacy of nelfinavir- and nevirapine-containing salvage regimens in nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-naive patients virologically failing a protease inhibitor (PI)-based combination. METHOD: A retrospective case note review of all patients virologically failing their PI-based combination who were switched to a regimen containing both nelfinavir (1 g t.d.s.) and nevirapine (200 mg b.d.). CD4 cell counts and viral loads were monitored. Genotypic analysis was performed using RT-PCR sequencing. RESULTS: Nineteen patients commenced a salvage regimen containing nelfinavir and nevirapine. Five patients also changed at least one nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), although in one case this represented recycling. Thirty-eight percent (6/16) of patients achieved a viral load below the level of detection (BLD; <200 copies/mL; complete responders [CR]), 3 achieved <20 copies/mL. Five patients achieved > or =1 log drop (partial responders [PR]) that was not sustained over follow-up, and five failed to respond to therapy (nonresponders [NR]). CRs tended to have wild-type NNRTI and PI sequences relative to PRs and NRs. CONCLUSION: In heavily pretreated patients, a nelfinavir-and nevirapine-containing salvage regimen resulted in a virological response in 38% of patients that was sustained in 31% over 63 weeks.
