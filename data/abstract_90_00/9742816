Postoperative mediastinitis is a rare but life-threatening complication after cardiac surgery. We successfully managed three infants with postoperative mediastinitis. When the postoperative mediastinitis was suspected, intravenous infusion of antibiotics (Vancomycin) and local irrigation were performed. The reoperation for closure was planned when the value of c-reactive protein decreased to 1.0-2.0. An application of a pectoral musculocutaneous flap was effective when the sternum was destroyed by infection.
