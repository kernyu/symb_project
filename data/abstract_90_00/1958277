Cyclosporin A (CyA) nephrotoxicity is at least partly caused by the vasoconstrictive action of the drug. In this study we set out to assess this hemodynamic effect of CyA on Doppler spectra obtained in arteries of human renal allografts. Doppler spectra of renal arteries were obtained shortly before and after the start of CyA infusion in renal transplant recipients. Doppler spectrum analysis revealed a significant change in several spectrum-derived parameters. Tmax (acceleration time of the systolic frequency peak), in particular, showed a decrease after 4 h of CyA administration (106 +/- 58 ms vs 76 +/- 36 ms in segmental arteries; P less than 0.05). On day 2 the Tmax returned to its original value (117 +/- 57 ms). Thus, Doppler spectrum analysis enables one to detect temporary hemodynamic changes in the transplanted kidney following CyA administration. These observations may be useful in differentiating causes of renal dysfunction by Doppler spectrum analysis in clinical transplantation.
