The effect of a chloramphenicol administration was examined on the selection of E. coli of the chicken intestinal flora, and of the infectious S. gallinarum and S. pullorum strains. On the other hand, an effort was made to detect the frequency of the resistance transmission of E. coli to above mentioned sensitive salmonella strains. Fourteen chicken, 12 infected and 2 negative controls were used. It was found that the enteric E. coli strains became resistant in a week's time. Besides, the strains that were used for infecting the chicken neither were selected through the chloramphenicol administered nor did they take the E. coli resistance, via R-factor transmission.
