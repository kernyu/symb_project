One method of resistance to beta-lactam antimicrobials involves production of beta-lactamases, enzymes that render the beta-lactam ineffective. Beta-lactamase inhibitors have been combined with beta-lactam antibiotics to combat beta-lactamase producing organisms. One such agent, piperacillin/tazobactam, has been shown to be safe and effective therapy for infections usually treated with a combination of antibiotics such as polymicrobial and nosocomial infection, and has been used for empiric therapy in cases of serious infection. A survey of the literature shows that piperacillin/tazobactam is a safe and efficacious therapy for bacteremia as well as soft tissue, intra-abdominal, and lower respiratory tract infections. When combined with an aminoglycoside, it is also useful in the treatment of severe nosocomial respiratory infections.
