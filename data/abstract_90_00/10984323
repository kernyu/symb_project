In 1997, an international surveillance program, SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program, was initiated with the aim of tracking the emergence of antimicrobial resistance worldwide. Results from reference antimicrobial susceptibility testing of bacterial pathogens (from bloodstream, inpatient and outpatient lower respiratory tract, urinary tract, and skin and soft-tissue infections) were included in an extensive database used to define antimicrobial resistance patterns throughout the world. On the basis of 1997-1999 test results from the Americas, fluoroquinolones continue to demonstrate potent in vitro activity against Enterobacteriaceae and important pathogens (Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and atypicals) that cause community-acquired respiratory tract infections. At published breakpoint concentrations, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin, and ciprofloxacin inhibited approximately 100% of H. influenzae isolates, including those that demonstrated resistance to beta-lactams and macrolides. Fluoroquinolones were also active against numerous other gram-negative bacilli and demonstrated high activity against S. pneumoniae and beta-hemolytic or viridans group streptococci. New fluoroquinolones maintain activity against penicillin-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae, with a low overall resistance in this species, even among the most recent (1999) clinical isolates. The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program will continue to monitor the antibacterial activity of these newer agents throughout the world, to identify emerging resistant strains and to facilitate possible intervention strategies as these newer compounds are used in the clinic setting.
