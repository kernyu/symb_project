Erythromycin susceptibility of clinical Streptococcus pyogenes isolates was determined at 19 Finnish clinical microbiology laboratories by their routine disk diffusion method and by a screening method adapted from the breakpoint susceptibility testing method. Results obtained at 12 laboratories using 4 major variants of the disk method were further evaluated. From these laboratories, 286 consecutive resistant and 349 consecutive susceptible isolates were sent to the Antimicrobial Research Laboratory, Turku where the MIC of erythromycin was determined. 96% and 97% of the disk results were correct, as compared with MIC results, when general and laboratory-specific breakpoints, respectively, were used. The results of the screening method were comparable to those of the disk method.
