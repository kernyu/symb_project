The effect of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation and exogenous glucocorticoids on the ability of splenic macrophages to control the growth of Mycobacterium avium was evaluated. We found that activation of the HPA axis by restraint stress or the addition of corticosterone increased the susceptibility of macrophages from mice that are innately susceptible to the in vivo growth of M. avium. In contrast, the ability of macrophages from innately resistant, congenic mice to control the growth of M. avium was not affected by HPA activation or the addition of corticosterone. The effect of restraint and of corticosterone on macrophage function was abrogated by either treating mice with the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486 or the addition of the drug to cultures of macrophages. Activation of the HPA axis as well as the addition of corticosterone to cultures of macrophages resulted in a suppression of the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and of reactive nitrogen intermediates by macrophages from both strains of mice. The lack of effect of HPA activation and of corticosterone on the mycobacterial resistance of macrophages from BCG-resistant mice, while at the same time suppressing the production of reactive nitrogen intermediates, appears to rule out a role for this antimicrobial pathway in innate resistance to mycobacterial growth.
