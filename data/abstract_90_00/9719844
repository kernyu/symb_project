The anthelmintic efficacy of benzimidazoles (albendazole, fenbendazole and oxfendazole), levamisole, oral ivermectin and closantel was evaluated on a farm in Kenya using faecal egg count reduction test, larval cultures and a controlled slaughter trial. The results of this study indicated simultaneous resistance of Haemonchus contortus against benzimidazoles, levamisole and ivermectin, and of Trichostrongylus colubriformis and Oesophagostomum spp. against levamisole on the same farm. Ivermectin resistance developed to 47% within 15 months of first use. Closantel was effective against the benzimidazoles, levamisole and ivermectin resistant H. contortus.
