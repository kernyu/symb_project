Biliary cancer and pancreatic cancer are considered to be difficult diseases to cure. Although complete resection provides the only means of curing these cancers, the rate of resectability is not high. Therefore, chemotherapy is often selected in patients with advanced unresectable biliary-pancreatic cancer. Many combination chemotherapy regimens have been applied in clinical trials. However, the survival time is not satisfactory. On the other hand, most chemotherapeutic agents induce anti-apoptotic transcriptional factor nuclear factor kappa b (NF-kappaB) activation, and agent-induced NF-kappaB activation is deeply involved in the onset of chemoresistance. Recently, novel approaches to potentiating chemosensitivity in cases of biliary-pancreatic cancer using NF-kappaB inhibitors with cytotoxic agents have been reported, most of which comprise translational research, although some clinical trials have also been conducted. Nevertheless, to date, there is no breakthrough chemotherapy regimen for these diseases. As some reports show promising data, combination chemotherapy consisting of a NF-kappaB inhibitor with chemotherapeutic agents seems to improve chemosensitivity and prolong the survival time of biliary-pancreatic cancer patients.
