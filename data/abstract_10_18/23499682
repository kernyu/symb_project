TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) appears to be a promising anticancer agent as it specifically kills a wide variety of cancer cells. However, resistance of subpopulations of cancer cells to TRAIL-induced cell death remains a major obstacle for successful treatment of cancer using TRAIL-based therapy. In this report we show that the hexokinase inhibitor 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) efficiently enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis through downregulation of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIP1) in breast cancer cells. Although 2-DG alone did not kill breast cancer cells, it sensitized the cells to TRAIL-induced cell death. This could be efficiently inhibited by blockage of the caspase cascade, suggesting 2-DG augments TRAIL-mediated apoptotic signaling. Indeed, treatment with 2-DG resulted in upregulation of TRAIL receptor 2 (TRAIL-R2), downregulation of cIAP1 and XIAP, and reduction in RIP1. The latter appeared to play an important role in regulating sensitivity of breast cancer cells to TRAIL, in that knockdown of RIP1 recapitulated, at least in part, the effect of 2-DG on TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these results indicate that 2-DG enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells by multiple mechanisms including suppression of RIP1, and highlight the potential therapeutic benefit of combinations of 2-DG and TRAIL in the treatment of breast cancer.
