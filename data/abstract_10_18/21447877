The XIX International HIV and Hepatitis Virus Drug Resistance Workshop offered scientists, clinical investigators, physicians and others an opportunity to present study results selected in a rigorous peer-review process and to discuss those data in an open forum. In 2010, Workshop organizers expanded the programme to include hepatitis B and C viruses, reasoning that workers in all three fields could benefit from shared experience, positive and negative. Slide sessions at the 2010 Workshop focused on hepatitis virus resistance to current and experimental antivirals; epidemiology of HIV resistance; HIV pathogenesis, fitness and resistance; resistance to new antiretrovirals; markers of response to HIV entry inhibitors; HIV persistence, reservoirs and elimination strategies; application of new viral sequencing techniques; and mechanisms of HIV drug resistance. This article summarizes all slide presentations at the Workshop.
