Operation Pangea is an annual international week of action combating pharmaceutical crime. In this study, called Operation Resistance, we asked the national agencies in Europe to search for falsified antibiotics and biopharmaceutical injectables (peptides and proteins) amongst the medicines seized in Pangea 7 (2014). Reports were received from Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, Spain, the United Kingdom, Norway, and Switzerland. The countries reported seizing about 21,000 dose units (e.g. tablets, capsules) of falsified antibiotics in total. Most of the antibiotics were unlicensed medicines with common antibiotic drugs. In this study week, very few falsified biopharmaceutical injectables were reported. Laboratories reported human growth hormone, sermorelin, melanotan II, and no active ingredients. The average shipment size seemed too large for personal use indicating that a substantial part was intended for resale. This study provides a snapshot of the falsified antibiotics and biopharmaceuticals that enter European countries. How much is actually reaching users during Pangea week - in on other weeks - remains unknown. The shipment sizes indicate falsified antibiotics and biopharmaceuticals are imported for both personal use and resale. The use of antibiotics from unreliable sources is a health risk, contributes to antimicrobial resistance, and may obscure a source of infection from health agencies. The falsified biopharmaceuticals are a health risk because they lack all labelling and may contain unlicensed drugs for injection. It seems important to raise awareness among health-care professionals that falsified medicines in Europe are not restricted to erectile dysfunction drugs. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
