Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected hepatitis is the common infectious disease. In the World Conservative Estimate Plan, the number of persons chronically infected with HBV is more than 300 million. Current regimen of treatment is far from satisfactory, as it is associated with certain side effects and viral resistance capacity. Therefore, a serious attention has recently been paid to the design and development of new potent anti-HBV agents. A variety of drugs have been synthesized and screened for their anti-HBV effects. These include nucleosides, natural compounds, quinolines, benzodiazepines, indoles, etc. Many of them are in wide trend in current treatment regimen. In this review, we have presented the recent development on the design and development of all categories HBV inhibitors studied.
