We studied 73 patients with paranoid schizophrenia with resistance to neuroleptics. All patients were divided into two groups - basic (37 patients) and comparison (36 patients). Both groups received traditional treatment. Patients of the basic group were treated with the combination of reamberin and cycloferon. Before treatment, significant alterations in the interferon status (IFS), which were characterized by the decrease of serum interferon (SIFN) activity and blood alpha- and gamma-interferons (IFN) levels, were identified in both group. The positive effect of the drug combination on clinical symptoms and interferon status (the normalization of SIFN activity, increase in blood alpha- and gamma-IFN levels) was found.
