We developed a multiplexed DNA microarray-based assay allowing identification of 12 causative agents of reproductive tract infections with the simultaneous detection of 47 genetic determinants of resistance to antimicrobial substances. The microarray was tested on 93 isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 32 isolates of Treponema pallidum and 29 samples of Ureaplasma spp./Mycoplasma spp. The N. gonorrhoeae isolates had multiple mutations in the penA, ponA, rpsJ, gyrA, parC, and mtrR genes; their prognostic value significantly increased when combinations of mutations were detected. In the analyzed T. pallidum isolates, single A2058G substitution in the 23S rRNA gene responsible for macrolide resistance was found. DNA sequences of Ureaplasma spp./Mycoplasma spp. were determined as wild type, which was not fully consistent with the results of analysis of their antimicrobial susceptibility.
