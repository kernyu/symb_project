We investigated 5 metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-positive Klebsiella isolates from Japan showing intermediate resistance to imipenem. Sequencing of the MBL gene identified a novel variant of IMP-1 with a single amino acid substitution, Glu87Gly. This variant is designated as IMP-34 where blaIMP-34 is located on a transmissible plasmid.
