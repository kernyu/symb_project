The purpose of this study was to further characterize the multi-antimicrobial resistance and antibiotic resistance gene expression associated with multi-drug resistance (MDR) in Salmonella spp. isolates from retail meats in Hanoi, Vietnam. A total of 14 Salmonella spp. belonging to 9 serotypes (e.g., Warragul, London, Derby, Indiana, Meleagridis, Give, Rissen, Assine, and Typhimurium) were tested for sensitivity to 8 antibiotics. Resistance to at least one antibiotic was shown in 13 strains (92.85%). The multiple antimicrobial resistances accounted for 64.29% of isolates (9/14). One hundred percent of MDR isolates possessed antibiotic resistant genes, in which 17, 16 and 11 genes were found in Salmonella (Salm) Typhimurium S360, S384, S181 respectively; 12 genes in each strain as Indiana, Warragul, and Meleagridis; 11 genes in Give, 8 genes in Derby and 6 genes in Rissen. Three antibiotic resistance genes (ssaQ, aadA, and gyrB) were present in all isolates, whereas Cephalosporin-resistant gene (e.g., CTX-M3-like) was not detected in any isolates. The results suggest that retail meats could constitute a source of human exposure to multi-drug resistant Salmonella and future research should focus on the impact of these MDR source on the human genome.
