Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), a tryptophan degrading enzyme, is a potent immunomodulatory factor. IDO expression in fibroblasts selectively induces apoptosis in immune cells but not in primary skin cells. However, the mechanism(s) of this selective effect of IDO-induced low tryptophan environment is not elucidated. The aim of present study was to investigate whether the activity of general control non-derepressible-2(GCN2) kinase stress-responsive pathway and its known inhibitor, protein IMPACT homolog, in immune and skin cells are differentially regulated in response to IDO-induced low tryptophan environment. IDO-expressing human fibroblasts were co-cultured with Jurkat cells, human T cells, fibroblasts, or keratinocytes. Activation of GCN2 pathway was significantly higher in immune cells exposed to IDO-expressing environment relative to that of skin cells. In contrast, IMPACT was highly and constitutively expressed in skin cells while its expression was very low in stimulated T cells and undetectable in Jurkat cells. A significant IDO-induced suppressive as well as apoptotic effect was demonstrated in IMPACT knocked down fibroblasts co-cultured with IDO-expressing fibroblasts. Proliferation of Jurkat cells, stably transduced with IMPACT-expressing vector, was rescued significantly in tryptophan-deficient but not IDO-expressing environment. This may be due to the ability of IMPACT to recover the effects of IDO-mediated tryptophan depletion (GCN2 dependent) but not the effects of IDO-generated cytotoxic metabolites. These findings collectively suggest for the first time that high expression of protein IMPACT homolog in non-immune cells such as skin cells acts as a protective mechanism against IDO-induced GCN2 activation, therefore, makes them resistant to the amino acid-deprived environment caused by IDO.
