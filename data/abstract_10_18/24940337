BACKGROUND: The increased reports of ESBL dissemination from various centres in south western, Nigeria and the recent emergence of carbapenem resistant bacteria prompted the conception of this study. OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate the relationship between high molecular weight plasmids and the expression of antibiotic multi-resistance including ESBL and carbapenemase. METHODS: We investigated 97 isolates of selected organisms consisting of 67 E. coli and 30 Klebseilla spp for the presence of plasmids expressing ESBL including carbapenem-hydrolysing enzymes. Beta-lactamase was determined using acidometric method, while ESBL and carbapenemase activity was determined using the double-disk diffusion test as well as the Modified Hodge test (MHT). Plasmid profiles of ESBL and carbapenemase positive isolates were determined according to standard protocols. RESULTS: An ESBL prevalence rate of 21.6% and carbapenem- resistance rate of 9.3% was recorded. Antibiotic susceptibility profile of ESBL isolates showed 100.0% resistance against Amoxicillin, Cotrimoxazole and Erythromycin. Moderate susceptibility was recorded against the Quinolone class of antibiotics; Meropenem remained the most active antibiotic against ESBL isolates with 62.5% against E. coli and 60% against K. pneumoniae. The plasmid profiles of our study isolates ranged from 11.8kbp to 35.5kbp. CONCLUSION: Due to the relationship between high molecular weight plasmids and multi-drug resistance, we hereby recommend regular molecular surveillance of this form in our study setting.
