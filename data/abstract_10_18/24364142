257 patients with active lung tuberculosis in the Saratov region were tested for distribution and mutation spectrum of the genes katG, inhA, ahpC encoding Isoniazid-resistance. The tests were implemented using the biological microchips with pharmacological kits TV-Biochip MDR (Russia). The rate of the Isoniazid-resistant M. tuberculosis strains incidence was found to be 55.7%. The Isoniazid-resistant strains demonstrated high rate (26.9%) of combined mutations in 2 and 3 genes simultaneously, domination in the katG ser315 -> Thrl (91.1%), thereby inducing high resistance to Isoniazid. The sensitivity of the TV-Biochip MDR test-system was 88.2%; the specificity, 91.3%. The results ofthis work show that the incidence of the Isoniazid-resistant strains should be limited using additional measures.
