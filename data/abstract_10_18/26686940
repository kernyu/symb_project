BACKGROUND: Bolivia is among the lowest-resourced South American countries, with very few data available on antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens. The phenotypic and molecular characterization of bacterial isolates responsible for urinary tract infections (UTIs) in the Bolivian Chaco are reported here. METHODS: All clinical isolates from UTIs collected in the Hospital Basico Villa Montes between June 2010 and January 2014 were analyzed (N=213). Characterization included susceptibility testing, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) detection, identification of relevant resistance determinants (e.g., CTX-M-type ESBLs, 16S rRNA methyltransferases, glutathione S-transferases), and genotyping of CTX-M producers. RESULTS: Very high resistance rates were observed. Overall, the lowest susceptibility was observed for trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, tetracycline, nalidixic acid, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin. Of E. coli and K. pneumoniae, 11.6% were ESBL producers. Resistance to nitrofurantoin, amikacin, and fosfomycin remained low, and susceptibility to carbapenems was fully preserved. CTX-M-15 was the dominant CTX-M variant. Four E. coli ST131 (two being H30-Rx) were identified. Of note, isolates harbouring rmtB and fosA3 were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Bolivia is not an exception to the very high resistance burden affecting many South American countries. Optimization of alternative approaches to monitor local antibiotic resistance trends in resource-limited settings is strongly encouraged to support the implementation of effective empiric treatment guidelines.
