Although the tuberculosis situation in Finland is good, the disease is common in many other regions of the world. Drug resistance is becoming more common and HIV promotes the activity of tuberculosis. Rapid recognition of risk groups will become increasingly important. Unvaccinated children constitute a new risk group, as they may quickly contract severe forms of the disease after exposure. In Finland there are also many people carrying a latent tuberculosis infection and an increased risk of relapse. The success of drug therapy going on for months can only be guaranteed by controlling the taking of medicaments in each patient.
