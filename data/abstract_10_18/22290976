We studied a clinical isolate of Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis showing resistance to oxyiminocephalosporins. PCR analysis confirmed the presence of bla(CTX-M-14) linked to IS903 in a 95-kb IncI1 conjugative plasmid. Such a plasmid is maintained on account of the presence of a pndAC addiction system. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis indicated that the strain belongs to ST11. This is the first report of bla(CTX-M-14) in Salmonella Enteritidis of human origin in South America.
