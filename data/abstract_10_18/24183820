The suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS-1) protein is a critical regulator in the immune systems of humans and mammals, which functions classically as an inhibitor of the IFN signaling pathways. However, data on functional characterisation of SOCS-1 in ancient vertebrates are limited. In this study, we report the function of teleost SOCS-1s in IFN signaling in fish models (zebrafish and Tetraodon) and human cells. Structurally, teleost SOCS-1s share conserved functional domains with their mammalian counterparts. Functionally, teleost SOCS-1s could be significantly induced upon stimulation with IFN stimulants and zebrafish IFNphi1. Overexpression of teleost SOCS-1s could dramatically suppress IFNphi1-induced Mx, Viperin and PKZ activation in zebrafish, and IFN-induced ISG15 activation in HeLa cells. Furthermore, a SOCS-1 variant that lacks the KIR domain was also characterised. This study demonstrates the conserved negative regulatory role of teleost SOCS-1s in IFN signaling pathways, providing perspective into the functional conservation of SOCS-1 proteins during evolution.
