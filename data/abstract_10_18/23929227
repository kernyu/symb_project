We report the first case in Ireland of an IMI-1 carbapenemase-producing Enterobacter asburiae, which was resistant to both colistin and fosfomycin. The circumstances under which this isolate was acquired were unclear. Several reports of IMI-producing Enterobacter spp. have emerged in recent years, and colistin resistance in Enterobacteriaceae is also increasingly reported. Laboratories should be aware of the unusual antibiograms of IMI-producing isolates.
