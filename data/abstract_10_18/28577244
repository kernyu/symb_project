BACKGROUND: Treatment success of H. pylori eradication therapy has declined worldwide largely because of increased antimicrobial resistance. New therapeutic approaches are needed, especially for countries like Iran, where resistance to commonly used drugs is already widespread and traditional H. pylori therapies produce poor cure rates. AIM: To review the results of quadruple therapy trials containing bismuth and furazolidone in Iran. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Google scholar as well as the references of all published papers for studies conducted in Iran, utilizing furazolidone in the treatment of H. pylori infections. The target population was four drug studies that utilized a combination of bismuth, furazolidone, amoxicillin, or tetracycline plus a proton pump inhibitor. RESULTS: Eighteen studies with 22 arms including 1713 subjects were found. The weighted mean cure rate for 14-day studies (six studies) using 200 mg b.i.d. furazolidone was 80% intention to treat (ITT) and 87% per protocol (PP). Studies using 100 mg b.i.d. (three studies) were less effective (weighted mean ITT cure rate = 67%). One small 14-day study with furazolidone 100 mg q.i.d. achieved cure rates of 94.5% ITT and PP. CONCLUSIONS: Although furazolidone-bismuth quadruple therapy proved relatively effective in Iran, furazolidone-containing regimens remain to be optimized. Based on these data and results from China, it appears likely that 14-day therapy containing furazolidone 100 mg t.i.d. or q.i.d. is likely to provide the highest cure rates with lowest side effects; this remains to be experimentally tested. Detailed suggestions for further development of furazolidone-containing regimens are provided.
