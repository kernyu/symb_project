Mycobacterium avium (M. avium) causes significant pulmonary infection, especially in immunocompromised hosts. Alveolar macrophages (AMs) represent the first line of host defense against infection in the lung. Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) activation of AMs enhances in vitro killing of pathogens such as M. avium We hypothesized that airway delivery of AMs into the lungs of immunodeficient mice infected with M. avium will inhibit M. avium growth in the lung and that this macrophage function is in part IFN-gamma dependent. In this study, normal BALB/c and BALB/c SCID mice received M. avium intratracheally while on mechanical ventilation. After 30 days, M. avium numbers increased in a concentration-dependent manner in SCID mice compared with normal BALB/c mice. Airway delivery of IFN-gamma-activated BALB/c AMs or J774A.1 macrophages overexpressing IFN-gamma into the lungs of SCID mice resulted in a significant decrease in M. avium growth (P < 0.01, both comparisons) and limited dissemination to other organs. In addition, airway delivery of IFN-gamma activated AMs and macrophages overexpressing IFN-gamma increased the levels of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha in SCID mice. A similar protective effect against M. avium infection using J774A.1 macrophages overexpressing IFN-gamma was observed in IFN-gamma knockout mice. These data suggest that administration of IFN-gamma activated AMs or macrophages overexpressing IFN-gamma may partially restore local alveolar host defense against infections like M. avium, even in the presence of ongoing systemic immunosuppression.
