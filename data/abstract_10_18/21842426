Denture stomatitis is often treated with antifungal agents but recurrences or new episodes are common, and certain episodes can be resistant. New triazoles, such as posaconazole and voriconazole, may represent useful alternatives for management. In vitro activities of amphotericin B, nystatin, miconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole and voriconazole against 150 oral Candida (101 C. albicans, 18 C. tropicalis, 12 C. glabrata, 11 C. guilliermondii, 4 C. parapsilosis, 2 Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 1 C. dubliniensis and 1 C. krusei) from 100 denture wearers were tested by the CLSI M27-A3 method. Resistant isolates were retested by Sensititre YeastOne and Etest. Most antifungal agents were very active. However, 4 C. glabrata (33.3%), 2 C. tropicalis (11.1%), 6 C. albicans (5.6%) and 1 C. krusei were resistant to itraconazole. Posaconazole was active against 143 yeast isolates (95.3%): 6 C. albicans (5.9%) and 1 C. tropicalis (5.6%) were resistant. Geometric mean MICs were 0.036 mug/ml for C. parapsilosis, 0.062 mug/ml for C. albicans, 0.085 mug/ml for C. tropicalis, 0.387 mug/ml for C. guilliermondii and 0.498 mug/ml for C. glabrata. Voriconazole was active against 148 isolates (98.7%) with geometric mean MICs ranging from 0.030 mug/ml for C. parapsilosis, 0.042 mug/ml for C. albicans, 0.048 mug/ml for C. tropicalis, 0.082 mug/ml for C. guilliermondii, to 0.137 mug/ml for C. glabrata. Only 2 C. albicans (2%) were resistant to voriconazole showing cross-resistance to other azoles. Posaconazole and voriconazole have excellent in vitro activities against all Candida isolates and could represent useful alternatives for recalcitrant or recurrent candidiasis.
