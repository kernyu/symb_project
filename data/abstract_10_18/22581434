High fructose feeding (66 % of fructose) induces type-2 diabetes in rats, which is associated with the insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia and oxidative stress. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of ethanol extract of Commiphora mukul gum resin (CMEE) on blood glucose, plasma insulin, lipid profiles, reduced glutathione, lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and enzymatic antioxidants like superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase in fructose-induced type-2 diabetic rats. A significant gain in body weight, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, increased lipid profiles, lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and decreased reduced glutathione, activities of enzymatic antioxidants and insulin sensitivity (increased homeostasis assessment assay) were observed in high-fructose-induced diabetic rats. The administration of CMEE (200 mg/kg/day) daily for 60 days in high-fructose-induced diabetic rats reversed the above parameters significantly. CMEE has the ability to improve insulin sensitivity and delay the development of insulin resistance, aggravate antioxidant status in diabetic rats and may be used as an adjuvant therapy for patients with insulin resistance.
