BACKGROUND: nosocomial infections are cause of morbidity and mortality and also increased costs. The aim was to evaluate the antimicrobial resistance in isolated clinical gram-positive and negative bacteria in a period of five years. METHODS: a retrospective descriptive epidemiological study was done. Analysis of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria Gram-positive and negative of 5117 clinical crops was done. Trend of proportions with Chi square (chi(2)) value of < 0.05 p was applied. RESULTS: the analyzed a sample crops, bacteria Gram-positive corresponded to 2622 (52.2 %) and bacteria gram negative to the 48.8 %. There is an increasing linear trend of resistance to antibiotics of Gram-positive: ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, streptomycin, penicillin, piperacillin / tazobactam, levofloxacin. For negative Gram: amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, aztreonam, cefazolin, cefepime, gatifloxacin, imipenem, piperacillin, tetracycline, ticarcillin clavulanic, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, meropenem, levofloxacin. CONCLUSION: the increase of antimicrobial resistance forces to control the use of antibiotics drugs in the hospital behavior.
