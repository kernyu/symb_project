AIMS: This study aimed to analyze the clinical data and characteristics of an NDM-1 (New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from the bloodstream of a leukemia patient. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was used for the clinical data of the patient. The modified Hodge test (MHT) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-disk synergy test were used for detecting metallo-beta-lactamase. Antibiotic resistance was determined using the agar dilution method. PCR was used to identify resistance genes. S1-PFGE (S1 nuclease/pulsed-field gel electrophoresis) and Southern blot hybridization were performed to determine the location of blaNDM-1. A conjugation experiment was used to confirm the transferable characteristics of the resistant genes. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was also performed. RESULTS: The patient developed bloodstream infections caused by this NDM-1-producing strain and died due to worsening of the condition. The strain was highly resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics and coharbored blaNDM-1, qnrB, and blaCTX-M-9 genes. Southern blot confirmed that blaNDM-1 was located on a plasmid of approximately 55 kb and could be transferred to Escherichia coli J53. MLST analysis showed that this strain belonged to an uncommon sequence type ST1224. CONCLUSION: The coexistence of various resistant genes is the mechanism for resistance to most antibiotics. Additionally, infections caused by multi-drug resistant bacteria increase the mortality of patients with immunodeficiency, which alerts clinicians to establish a rational and effective combination drug therapy.
