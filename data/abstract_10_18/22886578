A number of 1,2,3-triazolylmethyl piperazino oxazolidinone derivatives with optionally varied substituents at the 4N-piperazine position were synthesized and their antibacterial activity evaluated against a panel of susceptible and resistant Gram-positive and selected Gram-negative bacteria. Substitution with 5-membered heteroaroyl and dinitrobenzoyl moieties potentiated activity against staphylococci and enterococci strains. Furthermore, the compounds having dinitrobenzoyl 7n, 7o, and 5-nitrofuroyl 7t substitutions were four- to eightfold more potent than linezolid against M. catarrhalis. However, substitution of guanidino and other water-solubilizing functionalities at the 4N-piperazine position resulted in compounds that are devoid of antibacterial activity.
