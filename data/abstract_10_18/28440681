INTRODUCTION: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a leading cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality. Positively, the introduction of new directly-acting antivirals (DAAs) have led to dramatic improvements in response rates to antiviral therapy. Furthermore, newer generations of DAAs have demonstrated better safety profiles as well as efficacy than older generations. Current treatment recommendations are based on different combinations of DAAs. Current combination therapies rely on agents that target the different steps of viral replication by using different molecules from various DAAs families. Areas covered: In this review, the authors summarize data from of one of the recently developed NS5B polymerase inhibitors, dasabuvir, formerly known as ABT-333. Herein, the authors discuss the drug discovery data for dasabuvir including data from preclinical, toxicological resistance studies. The authors also review dasabuvir's clinical efficacy across various clinical challenges, in addition to its limitations in clinical practice. Expert opinion: Dasabuvir represents an important medical advance when used as a combination therapy for HCV. Unfortunately, it does present limitations like low genotypic coverage and further research is still required to address some of the lingering issues.
