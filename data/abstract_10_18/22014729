OBJECTIVE: To determine the occurrence of class A and class C beta-lactamase genes and their co-occurrence in Indian Enterobacteriaceae. METHODS: 52 third generation cephalosporin resistant isolates were phenotypically detected by combination disk method and screened by PCR to identify class A and class C type beta-lactamase genes. RESULTS: Of the 52 isolates, 94.2% (49) were found harboring any of the bla(ESBL(s)). bla(CTX-M), bla(SHV) and bla(TEM) were present in 82.6% (43/52), 59.6% (31/52), and 42.3% (22/52) isolates, respectively. Of the 49 ESBL positive isolates 57.1% (28/49) showed co-occurrence of bla(ampC) with bla(ESBL(s)). On the contrary, the collection from 2009 showed their co-occurrence in 81.4% isolates. CONCLUSIONS: The comparative study shows a downward trend for co-existence of bla(ESBL(s)) with bla(ampC) from 2009 to 2010. Further large scale studies are needed to address the co-occurrence of class A and class C beta-lactamases in India and the resistance trend occurring over a period of time.
