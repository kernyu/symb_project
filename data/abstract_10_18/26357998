We performed a retrospective analysis of clinical and laboratory data over 5 years in a tertiary centre to assess clinical and microbiological characteristics of patients with Raoultella spp. infection. Raoultella spp. were deemed responsible for clinical infections in 57 patients (R. planticola, n = 32 and R. ornithinolytica, n = 25). The most prevalent diagnoses for R. planticola were cystitis (50%; n = 16) followed by bacteraemia and pneumonia (9.4%; n = 3); for R. ornithinolytica, cystitis (36%; n = 9) followed by pneumonia (24%; n = 6). Immunodeficiency was present in 18 patients (56.3%) with R. planticola and in 16 patients (64%) with R. ornithinolytica infection. Of these, 55.6% and 37.5% had diabetes and 27.8% and 18.% were solid organ transplant recipients, respectively. All isolates were sensitive to third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides. Mortality of infections with R. planticola (n = 5; 15.6%) was higher than for R. ornithinolytica (n = 2; 8.0%), but the difference was not statistically significant.
