Extraction and analysis by LC-MS of peptidoglycan precursors represent a valuable method to study antibiotic mode of action and resistance in bacteria. Here, we describe how to apply this method for: (1) testing the action of different classes of antibiotics inhibiting cell wall biosynthesis in Bacillus megaterium; (2) studying the mechanism of self-resistance in mycelial actinomycetes producing glycopeptide antibiotics.
