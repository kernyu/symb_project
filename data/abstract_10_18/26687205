Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a leading cause of nosocomial infections and is responsible for approximately 10% of all hospital-acquired infections worldwide. It continues to pose a therapeutic challenge because of the high rate of morbidity and mortality associated with it and the possibility of development of drug resistance during therapy. Standard antibiotic regimes against P. aeruginosa are increasingly becoming ineffective due to the rise in drug resistance. With the scope for developing new antibiotics being limited, alternative treatment options are gaining more and more attention. A number of recent studies reported complementary and alternative treatment options to combat P. aeruginosa infections. Quorum sensing inhibitors, phages, probiotics, anti-microbial peptides, vaccine antigens and antimicrobial nanoparticles have the potential to act against drug resistant strains. Unfortunately, most studies considering alternative treatment options are still confined in the pre-clinical stages, although some of these findings have tremendous potential to be turned into valuable therapeutics. This review is intended to raise awareness of several novel approaches that can be considered further for combating drug resistant P. aeruginosa infections.
