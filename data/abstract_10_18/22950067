BACKGROUND: Acinetobacter baumannii resistance islands (AbaRs) have been recently recognized as mobile genetic elements that harbor multiple resistance determinants and are associated with multidrug resistance (MDR). In the present study, we aimed to determine the AbaRs conferring multiple antimicrobial resistance and their clonal relatedness to MDR A. baumannii clinical isolates obtained from a university hospital in Daejeon, Korea. METHODS: This study included 29 MDR A. baumannii strains isolated in Daejeon, Korea. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by Etest. A. baumannii isolates were characterized using the 2 multiplex PCR assays and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme. To detect and characterize AbaRs, PCR and PCR mapping experiments were performed. RESULTS: Twenty-seven of the 29 isolates belonged to the European (EU) clone II lineage and contained 5 sequence types (STs) (75, 92, 137, 138, and 357). In this study, ST357 was confirmed for the first time in Korea. Only 2 of the 29 isolates belonged to the EU clone I lineage, and were confirmed as ST109. These 2 isolates harbored the 22-kb AbaR7 aacC1-orfP-orfQ-aadA1 gene cassette array. In contrast, AbaR was not found in EU clone II isolates. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study that attempted to determine the AbaRs in MDR A. baumannii isolates in Korea. We found 2 EU clone I isolates (ST109) that harbored AbaR7.
