OBJECTIVES: The replication defect of hepatitis B virus (HBV) lamivudine-resistant mutants can be restored by the development of compensatory mutations. Such mutations have long been recognized for the rtM204V mutant, while little is known about any compensatory mutation specific to the rtM204I mutant. The aim of this study was to search for previously unrecognized compensatory mutations following development of lamivudine-resistant mutants. METHODS: Of 83 lamivudine-resistant patients, 49 and 34 patients harboured the rtM204I and rtM204V mutations, respectively. Serial serum samples obtained during the therapeutic course were submitted to sequence analysis. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments were performed to examine the functions of the identified associated mutations. RESULTS: Of the 49 patients carrying the rtM204I mutation, 5 subsequently developed an rtS117F substitution during the follow-up, whereas 4 harboured an rtN124D substitution prior to the development of the rtM204I mutation. Emergence of the rtS117F mutation was associated with an increase in hepatitis activity, whereas prior existence of the rtN124D mutation was associated with decompensated liver function upon development of the rtM204I mutation. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments showed that the rtS117F mutation by itself did not confer lamivudine resistance but it compensated for replication deficiency of the rtM204I mutant in HepG2 and Mahlavu cells. Additionally, virion and hepatitis B surface antigen secretion of the rtS117F mutant was significantly impaired. CONCLUSIONS: The rtS117F substitution served as a compensatory mutation for rtM204I. Emergence of the rtS117F mutation in lamivudine-resistant patients carrying rtM204I was associated with increased hepatitis activities. Prior existence of the rtN124D substitution was associated with liver decompensation upon development of the rtM204I mutation.
