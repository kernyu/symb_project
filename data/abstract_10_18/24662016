BACKGROUND: The prevalence and clinical impact on mortality of carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA) is unclear in Taiwan. We aim to clarify these clinical issues by using data from the Taiwan Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance (TSAR) program. METHODS: Patients from five hospitals with their P. aeruginosa isolates collected by TSAR II-VII (2000-2010) program were considered as the potential study population. All patients with CRPA were enrolled as case patients. Patients with carbapenem-susceptible P. aeruginosa were randomly selected in a 1:1 ratio to case patients as control patients. CRPA isolates were tested for the presence of carbapenemase-producing genes. The clinical data were collected to identify risk factors for CRPA carriage and mortality of P. aeruginosa infection. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of CRPA was 10.2% (349/3408), which increased significantly by the TSAR period (p = 0.007). Among the 164 enrolled patients, the risk factor for carrying CRPA was previous fluoroquinolone exposure (p = 0.004). The risk factors for mortality among 80 patients with infection by P. aeruginosa included: intensive care unit (ICU) setting, receipt of antifungal therapy, and presence of invasive devices (p = 0.001, 0.010, and 0.017; respectively). Carbapenem resistance did not play a role. Among the 82 CRPA isolates enrolled in this study, 15 isolates were found to carry carbapenemase-producing genes. CONCLUSION: In Taiwan, the prevalence of CRPA and carriage of carbapenemase-producing genes was high. However, carbapenem resistance did not play a role in the mortality of patients with P. aeruginosa infections.
