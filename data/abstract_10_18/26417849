The resistance of Helicobacter pylori to classical antimicrobial treatment has become increasingly common, whereupon biofilms are considered to play an important role in the resistance mechanism. Here 10.2% of amoxicillin (AMX) and a novel anti H. pylori adhesion material pectin sulfate (PECS) loaded lipid polymer nanoparticles (LPN) were prepared, with rhamnolipid and phospholipids as the outer mixed lipids layer (RHL-PC-LPN). The size of RHL-PC-LPN was around 200 nm, was negatively-charged, and showed sustained and complete drug release within 24h. In an in vitro study, H. pylori biofilm models were successfully established. RHL-PC-LPN, superior to PC-LPN (employing phospholipids only as the outer lipid layer), PECS+AMX (mixture of PECS and AMX) and AMX only, was proven to significantly eradicate H. pylori in the biofilm form. In accordance to our previous results, the RHL-PC-LPN group, together with the PC-LPN and PECS+AMX group, inhibited H. pylori from adhering to AGS cells. Investigating the underlying mechanisms contributing to the death of H. pylori caused by RHL-PC-LPN, we found that LPN could lower the antibiotic minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) to biofilm form from 125 mug/ml to 15.6 mug/ml. Furthermore, FITC-ConA labeled extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) were decreased in the RHL-PC-LPN group observed by a laser scanning confocal microscope. Therefore, we conclude that employing the mixed lipids of rhamnolipid and phospholipids as the outer layer of nanoparticles and PECS as the inner core produces a system capable of significantly disrupting H. pylori biofilm by eliminating the EPS as well as inhibiting the adherence and colonization of bacteria.
