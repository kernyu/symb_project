Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), also known as Kala-Azar, is a disseminated protozoal infection caused principally by Leishmania donovani and Leishmania infantum (known as Leishmania chagasi in South America). The therapeutic options for VL are diverse and depend on different factors, such as the geographical area of the infection, development of resistance to habitual treatments, HIV co-infection, malnourishment and other concomitant infections. This article provides an exhaustive review of the literature regarding studies published on the treatment of VL, and gives therapeutic recommendations stratified according to their level of evidence, the species of Leishmania implicated and the geographical location of the infection.
