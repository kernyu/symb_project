A patient with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis due to an azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus is described. Despite treatment change from voriconazole to amphotericin B as soon as the resistance data were available, the patient died. Azole resistance is an emerging problem, which significantly complicates the management of A. fumigatus infections. It should be considered in every patient with an invasive A. fumigatus infection who is not responding to voriconazole therapy.
