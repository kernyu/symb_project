OBJECTIVE: To study the radiobiological characteristics of a HepG2 cell line with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletion. METHODS: HepG2 cells were cultured in a medium containing ethidium bromide, acetylformic acid and uracil. The HepG2 cell line with mtDNA deletion (rho(0)HepG2 cells) were acquired after 30 subcultures by limited dilution cloning. The cell survival was then observed in the absence of acetylformic acid and uracil, and the total mtDNA deletion in the cells was confirmed by PCR. The radiosensitivity of HepG2 and rho(0)HepG2 cells was evaluated by exposure to gradient doses of 6 MV X ray irradiation. The cell apoptosis was assessed following a 2 Gy X-ray exposure with Hochest33342 staining, and the invasiveness of rho(0)HepG2 cells was measured by Transwell assay. RESULTS: HepG2 cells could survive 30 subcultures in the presence of ethidium bromide, and massive cell death occurred after removal of acetylformic acid and uracil from the medium. PCR confirmed total mtDNA deletion from rho(0)HepG2 cells, whose alpha/beta value was significantly lower than that of HepG2 cells. rho(0)Hep-G2 cells showed an obviously lowered cell apoptosis rate following X-ray exposure with enhanced cell invasiveness. CONCLUSION: HepG2 cells can be induced by ethidium bromide into rho(0)HepG2 cells with an increased radiation resistance, anti-apoptosis ability and cell invasiveness.
