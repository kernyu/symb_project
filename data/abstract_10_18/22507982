The aim of the current study is to investigate the effect of ceramides on genistein-induced anti-melanoma effects in vitro. We found that exogenously added cell-permeable short-chain ceramides (C6) dramatically enhanced genistein-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in cultured melanoma cells. Genistein treatment only induced a moderate intracellular ceramides accumulation in B16 melanoma cells. Two different agents including 1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP), a ceramide glucosylation inhibitor, and the sphingosine kinase-1 (SphK1) inhibitor II (SKI-II), a sphingosine (ceramides precursor) phosphorylation inhibitor, both facilitated genistein-induced ceramides accumulation and melanoma cell apoptosis. Co-administration of ceramide (C6) and genistein induced a significant Akt inhibition and c-jun-NH(2)-kinase (JNK) activation, caspase-3 cleavage and cytochrome c release. Caspase-3 inhibitor z-DVED-fmk, JNK inhibitor SP 600125, or to restore Akt activation by introducing a constitutively active form of Akt (CA-Akt) diminished ceramide (C6) and genistein co-administration-induced in vitro anti-melanoma effect. Our study suggests that increasing cellular level of ceramides may sensitize genistein-induced anti-melanoma effects.
