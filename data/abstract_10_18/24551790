Antibiotic resistance makes Antimierobial peptides (AMPs) agents an alternative for treatment of pathogenic diseases. They are isolated from various invertebrate animals, vertebrates and plants. The present study shows the electrophoretic pattern of protein and peptides from Vicia faba seed and reports our first attempt to study the antibacterial activity of Vicia faba seed extract. The crude extract electrophoresis was carried out on 12% SDS- PAGE gel. Antibacterial activity on E. Coli and B. Subtilis from hospital infection was tested and evaluated by measuring the inhibition zone diameter observation. The SDS- PAGE gel electrophoresis shows that the crude extract contains many proteins and peptides with different molecular weight. The inhibition zone was not observed in antibacterial properties tests. Thus, our experiments don't show any antibacterial activity on E. Coli and B. Subtilis from hospital isolates. Some other AMPs haven't also shown any antimicrobial properties on clinical trial. The antibacterial activity of the crude Vicia faba seed extract should also be tested on standard bacteria.
