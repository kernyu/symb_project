In order to reveal colonization with multidrug-resistant bacteria early, routine screening is done on samples of all patients of the neonatal intensive care units at Semmelweis University, Hungary. Due to the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) screening examinations, emergence of multidrug-resistant Enterobacter cloacae isolates was found with suspicion of clonal transmission, therefore active microbiological surveillance was initiated. The aim of our study was to characterize 60 E. cloacae isolates recovered in a 7-month period in 2010. MIC values of antibiotics were determined and ESBL and carbapenemase production was tested. Metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) genes, ESBL genes, and class-1 integrons were characterized, and the possible clonal relationship between isolates was investigated. The isolates showed increased MIC values for carbapenems and cephalosporins. All 60 E. cloacae strains recovered from 16 neonates proved to be VIM-4 MBL producers. Fifty-three strains were SHV-12 ESBL producers also. In all cases, the bla(VIM-4) gene was a part of class-1 integron, In238a. XbaI-macrorestriction analysis by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) revealed identical patterns for the isolates. Our study supports the importance of active microbiological surveillance as well as molecular epidemiology at the NICUs as a part of infection control.
