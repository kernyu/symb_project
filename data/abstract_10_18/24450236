We collected flies from Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport to examine for the presence of bacteria and to determine the sensitivity patterns of those bacteria. A total of 1,228 flies were collected from 6 sites around Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport from April to September 2011. The predominant species was Chrysomya megacephala (n=276, 22.5%). Antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative enteric bacteria (n=48) were isolated from flies using MacConkey agar supplemented with cephalothin (20 microg/ml). These were identified as Escherichia coli (n=37), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=6), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=3) and Aeromonas hydrophila (n=2). All isolated bacteria were tested for resistance to 21 commonly used antimicrobials: amoxicillin (100%), ticarcillin (100%), cephalothin (100%), cefuroxime (100%), ceftazidime 1 (93.8%), piperacillin (93.8%), cefotaxime (89.6%), ticarcillin-clavulanate (81.3%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (62.5%), ciprofloxacin (54.2%), gentamicin (45.8%), cefepime (39.6%), tobramycin (39.6%), ceftazidime (22.9%), cefoxitin (16.7%), amikacin (16.7%), netilmicin (14.6%), amoxicillin-clavulanate (6.3%) and piperacillin-tazobactam (2.1%). No resistance to meropenem or imipenem was observed. Antibiotic resistance genes among the isolated bacteria were analyzed for by polymerase chain reaction. Thirty of the 48 bacteria with resistance (62.5%) possessed the blaTEM gene.
