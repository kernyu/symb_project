The purpose of the current study was to investigate the susceptibility of Schistosoma japonicum to praziquantel in low endemic foci of China. During the non-transmission period of schistosomiasis, a total of 43 of 1,242 subjects were identified as being infected with the parasite using parasitological stool examinations in two low-endemicity areas of China, with a prevalence rate of 3.46%. All stool-egg-positive subjects were treated with praziquantel in a single oral dose of 40 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg for two successive days. Six weeks post-treatment, no S. japonicum eggs were detected in the 43 treated villagers. The results indicate that the current efficacy of praziquantel against S. japonicum seems satisfactory and has not changed over the past three decades in the low endemic areas of China. It is also suggested that no evidence of tolerance or resistance to praziquantel in S. japonicum is detected in areas with low endemicity in China.
