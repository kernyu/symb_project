Although amantadine derivatives are the only M2 drugs for influenza virus A, their use is limited in the U.S. because of drug resistance. Here we report the identification of multiple M2 inhibitors that were rapidly generated through focused screening of a small primary amine library that was designed using a scaffold-hopping strategy based on amantadine. These compounds are as active as amantadine and might be hits for further lead generation processes.
