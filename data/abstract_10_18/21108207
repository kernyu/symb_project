The authors described a case of a 30 year-old man with chronic hepatitis C (G1,S1) complicated by pulmonary embolism (PE), preceded by symptoms of respiratory system infection, which occurred after 6 months of combination therapy with pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin. Right sided nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis as a source of segmental/subsegmental PE was found. Hemostatic work up showed increased activated protein C resistance, elevated factor VIII activity and fibrinogen concentration as well as hyperhomocysteinaemia (all these disturbances returned to normal 3-6 months later). The patient's clinical status improved during anticoagulation therapy. Antiviral treatment was not continued as virological response was achieved.
