BACKGROUND: Acinetobacter baumannii is usually multi-drug resistant (MDR), including third generation cephalosporins, amino glycosides and fluoroquinolone. Resistance to these antibiotics is mediated by multiple factors such as: lactamases, efflux pumps and other mechanisms of resistance. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was then used to investigate the genetic relationships among the MDR isolates. AIM: The aim of this study was to determine MDR isolates and the existence of OXAs genes among MDR isolates of A. baumannii collected from Kermanshah hospitals in west of Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two MDR A. baumannii were collected from patients at Kermanshah hospitals. The isolates were identified by biochemical tests and API 20NE kit. The susceptibility to different antibiotics by disk diffusion method was determined. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed for detection of blaOXA-23-like , blaOXA-24-like , blaOXA-51-like and blaOXA-58-like betalactamase genes in isolates and clonal relatedness was done by PFGE (with the restriction enzyme ApaI) and patterns analyzed by Bionumeric software. RESULTS: This study showed high resistant to ciprofloxacin, piperacillin, ceftazidime and also resistant to other anti-microbial agents and more spread blaOXA-23-like gene (93%) in MDR isolate. The PFGE method obtained six clones: A (10), B (9), C (5), D (4), E (11) and F (3) that clone E was outbreak and dominant in different wards of hospitals studied. CONCLUSION: An isolate from the emergency ward of these hospitals had indistinguishable isolates PFGE profile and similar resistance profile to isolates from intensive care unit (ICU), suggesting likely transmission from ICU to emergency via patient or hospital staff contact.
