Colonization and/or infection with multidrug-resistant microorganisms (MDRO) of pressure ulcers in patients receiving care at home have seldom been investigated. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of MDRO colonization in pressure ulcers of patients receiving home care in Palermo, Italy. Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (MDRGN) were isolated, identified, and characterized from pressure ulcers and selected home environment surfaces. Thirty-two patients were enrolled, of whom 12 were under antimicrobial therapy. Five patients had been admitted to hospital in the preceding year. Nineteen patients tested positive for 1 or more MDROs. In particular, 1 patient was colonized by a vanA-containing strain of VRE, 5 by MRSA, and 17 by MDRGN of different species. Our findings suggest that pressure ulcers in home care patients could play a role in bringing MDROs into the community setting.
