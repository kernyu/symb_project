The present method quantifies the number of slow-growing bacteria leading to antibiotic persistence in a clonal population. First, it enables discriminating between slow growers that are generated by exposure to a stress signal (Type I persisters) and slow growers that are continuously generated during exponential growth (Type II persisters). Second, the method enables determining the amount of slow growers in a culture.
