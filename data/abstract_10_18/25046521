AIM: To evaluate fusidic acid resistance pheno- and geno-typically in nasal carriage Staphylococcus aureus isolated from general practice patients in nine European countries. MATERIALS & METHODS: Phenotypic fusidic acid resistance was determined by disc diffusion and MIC values, and genotypically by a PCR detecting fusA-E genes. The main analysis was performed on methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strains, because methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates were scarce. RESULTS: Overall S. aureus fusidic acid resistance was low (<10%). fusC was the predominant mechanism of resistance and associations were found between resistance genes and specific spa types. CONCLUSION: S. aureus strains showed low resistance to fusidic acid, making this antibiotic an appropriate choice in the treatment of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus skin infections in general practice patients in the nine participating European countries.
