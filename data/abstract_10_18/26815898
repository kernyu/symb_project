PURPOSE: beta-hemolytic streptococci (betaHS) causes a diverse array of human infections. The molecular epidemiology of beta-hemolytic streptococcal infections in trauma patients has not been studied. This study reports the molecular and clinical epidemiology of beta-hemolytic streptococcal infections at a level 1 trauma centre of India. METHODS: A total of 117 isolates of betaHS were recovered from clinical samples of trauma patients. The isolates were identified to species level and subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was done to detect exotoxin virulence genes. The M protein gene (emm gene) types of GAS strains were ascertained by sequencing. RESULTS: Group A Streptococcus (GAS) was the most common isolate (64 %), followed by group G Streptococcus (23 %). A large proportion of GAS produced speB (99 %), smeZ (91 %), speF (95 %) and speG (87 %). smeZ was produced by 22 % of GGS. A total of 25 different emm types/subtypes were seen in GAS, with emm 11 being the most common. Resistance to tetracycline (69 %) and erythromycin (33 %) was commonly seen in GAS. CONCLUSIONS: beta-hemolytic streptococcal infections in Indian trauma patients are caused by GAS and non-GAS strains alike. A high diversity of emm types was seen in GAS isolates, with high macrolide and tetracycline resistance. SpeA was less commonly seen in Indian GAS isolates. There was no association between disease severity and exotoxin gene production.
