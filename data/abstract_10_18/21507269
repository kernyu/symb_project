BACKGROUND: The role of chronic renal failure (CRF) in the antimicrobial resistance of uropathogens in patients with community-acquired acute pyelonephritis (APN) remains poorly understood. METHOD: We performed a retrospective analysis of 502 adults (54 men, 448 women; mean age 61.7 +/- 16.0 years, range 18-98 years) who were treated for community-acquired APN at Kosin University Gospel Hospital (Busan, Republic of Korea) during a ten-year period (January 2000 to December 2009). We evaluated the spectra and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of uropathogens in CRF and non-CRF patients with community-acquired APN that presented as a positive urine culture. RESULTS: The 502 adult subjects were classified as either non-CRF APN patients (336 patients, 66.9%) or CRF APN patients (166 patients, 33.1%) according to their estimated glomerular filtration rate. No significant differences in the sensitivity of E. coli to a third cephalosporin, aminoglycoside (except gentamycin), or ciprofloxacin were observed between non-CRF and CRF patients. CONCLUSIONS: In our series of patients with community-acquired APN that initially presented as a positive urine culture, CRF did not influence the isolation rates of different uropathogens or their patterns of susceptibility to antimicrobials.
