Although drug resistance in tuberculosis is by no means a new problem, multiple drug resistance is a cause of increasing concern. This study investigated first-line drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains isolated in a hospital environment and strains submitted as the Reference Center from 2000 to 2010. A total of 650 cultures were tested against first-line using the BACTEC MGIT 960 system. Resistance to first-line drugs was detected in 142 strains, (21.85%). A total of 2% were multiresistant (MDR). Of the strains resistant to first-line drugs, the greatest resistance was found to isoniazid (7.38 %) followed by rifampin and streptomycin (3.85%), pyracinamide (2%), and ethambutol 1.23%. Only one strain was resistant to four drugs. Values. In view of the resistance observed, careful surveillance of drug resistance is recommended.
