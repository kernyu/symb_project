We report 20 cases of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis managed in France. Treatment was individualized and included bedaquiline and linezolid for most patients and surgery in 8 patients. At last follow-up (22 months), 19 patients had achieved conversion from positive to negative on culture testing. These promising results of comprehensive management obtained in a small series deserve confirmation.
