The emergence of antimicrobial resistance has created a need for the development of novel antibacterial therapies to treat infection. Natural products that exhibit antibacterial activity offer validated starting points for library generation, and the authors report here that small molecule mimics of tetramate-containing natural products may show antibacterial activity and offer the potential for further optimization.
