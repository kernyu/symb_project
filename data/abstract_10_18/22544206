This report describes a pilot study, conducted in Nigeria, of the World Health Organization protocol for monitoring human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drug resistance (HIVDR) and associated program factors among patients receiving first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART). In 2008, 283 HIV-infected patients starting ART were consecutively enrolled at 2 ART clinics in Abuja. Twelve months after ART initiation, 62% were alive and on first-line ART, 3% had died, 1% had transferred out of the program, and 34% were lost to follow-up. Among patients on first-line ART at 12 months, 90% had viral suppression. However, in view of the high loss to follow-up rate (34%), strategies for patient retention and tracking are critical to minimize possible HIVDR and optimize treatment outcomes.
