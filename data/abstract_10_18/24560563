The neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu(R)), zanamivir (Relenza(R)), laninamivir octanoate (Inavir(R)), and peramivir (Rapiacta(R)) have been available for the treatment of influenza in Japan since 2010. To assess the extent of viral resistance, we measured the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(5)(0)) of each drug for influenza virus isolates from the 2011-2012 influenza season. Specimens were obtained from patients prior to treatment. Viral isolation was done using Madine-Darby canine kidney cells, and the type and subtype of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), or influenza B were determined by RT-PCR using type- and subtype-specific primers. The IC(5)(0) was determined by a neuraminidase inhibition assay using a fluorescent substrate. The lineage of influenza B virus was determined by direct sequencing of the hemagglutinin gene. Influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B viruses were isolated in 283 and 42 patients, respectively, while no influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was isolated. No isolate showed an IC(5)(0) value exceeding 50 nM for any of the neuraminidase inhibitors. IC50 values for A(H3N2) were similar between the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 seasons. In contrast, the IC(5)(0) values for influenza B viruses in the 2011-2012 season to the four drugs were significantly lower than those found in the 2010-2011 season. These results indicate that the currently epidemic influenza viruses are susceptible to all four neuraminidase inhibitors, with no trend for IC(5)(0) values to increase in Japan at present.
