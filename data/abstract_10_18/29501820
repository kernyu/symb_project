INTRODUCTION: Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR-AB) is one of the most significant nosocomial pathogens, that is increasingly being isolated in healthcare settings worldwide. Owing to its inherent drug-resistant nature, coupled with its ability to readily acquire resistance to other antibiotic classes, there is a real dearth of antibiotics available to treat infections with MDR-AB. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A commercially available library was screened against MDR-AB BAA-1605 to identify novel inhibitory molecules. The selectivity index of hit was tested against Vero cells and it's in vitro efficacy was profiled against a panel of clinical multi-drug resistant A. baumannii. The bacteriostatic or bactericidal nature was determined by time kill experiments and its synergy with approved drugs was determined by chequerboard method. In addition, it's in vivo efficacy was measured in a murine neutropenic A. baumannii thigh infection model. RESULTS: SRI-12742 was identified as a potent hit active with an MIC of 4 mg/L. Its activity was then profiled against a MDR clinical strain panel (MIC 4-64 mg/L). SRI-12742 exhibited concentration dependent bactericidal activity and reduced approximately 16 log10 CFU, which is comparable to minocycline. In the murine model of A. baumannii infection, SRI-12742 reduced CFU by approximately 0.9 log10 CFU, which is comparable to polymyxin B. Additionally, SRI-12742 synergized with all the classes of antibiotics tested. CONCLUSION: SRI-12742 exhibits all the criteria to be positioned as a novel lead with potential to be deployed for the treatment of infections caused by MDR-AB.
