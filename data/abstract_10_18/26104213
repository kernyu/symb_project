The complex cell envelope is a hallmark of mycobacteria and is anchored by the peptidoglycan layer, which is similar to that of Escherichia coli and a number of other bacteria but with modifications to the monomeric units and other structural complexities that are likely related to a role for the peptidoglycan in stabilizing the mycolyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex (MAPc). In this article, we will review the genetics of several aspects of peptidoglycan biosynthesis in mycobacteria, including the production of monomeric precursors in the cytoplasm, assembly of the monomers into the mature wall, cell wall turnover, and cell division. Finally, we will touch upon the resistance of mycobacteria to beta-lactam antibiotics, an important class of drugs that, until recently, have not been extensively exploited as potential antimycobacterial agents. We will also note areas of research where there are still unanswered questions.
