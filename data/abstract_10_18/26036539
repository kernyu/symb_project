BACKGROUND: Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a major issue in solid organ transplant recipients. Although development of prophylaxis and preemptive procedures have presented significantly improved consequences in CMV infection, increasing incidence of antiviral resistance has raised virologists' concern. METHODS: The present study focused on kidney transplant recipients with high quantities of CMV load after antiviral therapy. We collected 5 mL blood from each of 58 patients. DNA extraction was performed with the use of the QIAamp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. RESULTS: Our population study was 38% female and 62% male. CMV DNA was observed in 50 specimens (86%) with the range of 1.9 x 10(3) to 11 x 10(7) copies/mL serum. All of these patients had received ganciclovir for >3 months. Sequencing showed 18 mutations in 10 patients. Among these, 16 mutations were associated with Ul97 and the rest with Ul54 gene. Forty CMV-positive patients did not show any mutations. CONCLUSIONS: The consequences of long-term ganciclovir resistance could not be determined.
