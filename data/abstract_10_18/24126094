Two different series of N-substituted imidazolium oximes and their monoquaternary salts were synthesized and biologically tested with respect to their ability to inhibit growth a diverse panel of antibiotic susceptible Gram-positive and antibiotic resistant Gram-negative bacteria as well fungal strains. The newly synthesized compounds were analyzed by spectral studies to confirm their structure. The preliminary results showed that all compounds tested possess promising antimicrobial potential against both susceptible Gram-positive and antibiotic resistant Gram-negative isolates, exhibiting a wide range of MIC values from 0.14 to 100.0 mug/mL. The structure-activity relationship demonstrates that the p-methylphenyl and p-fluorophenyl groups in monoquaternary salts 6 and 7 attached directly to the imidazolium ring could be essential for observed remarkable inhibitory profiles against clinically important pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC=0.14 mug/mL) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC=1.56 mug/mL). Furthermore, the broth microdilution assay was then used to investigate the antiresistance efficacy of compound 7 against fourteen extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains in comparison to eight clinically relevant antibiotics. Compound 7 exhibited a remarkable antiresistance profiles ranging between 0.39 and 12.50 mug/mL against all of ESBL-producing strains, which leads to the suggestion that may be interesting candidate for development of new antimicrobials to combat multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacteria.
