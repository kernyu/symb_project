An F-box protein (VpEIFP1) induced by Erysiphe necator was isolated from Vitis pseudoreticulata, a wild Chinese grapevine species naturally resistant to powdery mildew (PM). It contains an F-box domain and two Kelch-repeat motifs. Expression profiles indicate the VpEIFP1 is strongly induced at both transcriptional and translational levels by PM infection. A subcellular localisation assay showed that VpEIFP1 is predominantly located in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Overexpression of VpEIFP1 accelerated the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and up-regulated the expressions of ICS2, NPR1 and PR1 involved in defence responses, resulting in suppression of PM germination and growth. As an F-box protein, VpEIFP1 interacts with thioredoxin z (VpTrxz) in the yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) assay and in the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay. Decreased amounts of VpTrxz protein in transgenic grapevine leaves overexpressing VpEIFP1 were restored by proteasome inhibitor MG132, implying that VpEIFP1 mediated VpTrxz for degradation through the SCF(VpEIFP1) (Skp1-Cullin-F-box) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. The RNA interference line of VpTrxz showed increased H2O2 accumulation following PM inoculation. We propose VpEIFP1 positively modulates the grapevine defence response to PM by inducing the degradation of VpTrxz via the ubiquitin/26S proteasome system.
