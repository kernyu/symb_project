Artemisinin combination therapies have decreased malaria associated morbidity and mortality in several parts of the world. On the other hand, malaria cases have increased in sub-Saharan Africa largely due to falciparum resistance to the most frequently used drugs (chloroquine and sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) combination). Therapeutic failure has also been attributed in part to adverse effects of anti-malarial drugs and patients' non-compliance due to inconvenient dosing schedules. We consider that formulation and evaluation of novel drug delivery systems is not only less expensive than developing new drugs, but may also improve delivery of anti-malarials at the desired rates. In this review we evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of existing anti-malarial drugs and assess the feasibility of developing novel formulations and delivery systems.
