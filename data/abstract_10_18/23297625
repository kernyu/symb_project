AIM: Study the interaction of vaginal corynebacteria and lactobacilli in realization of oxidative mechanism of antagonistic relations of bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Effect of supernatants of corynebacteria inhibiting catalase on antagonism of peroxide producing lactobacilli to Staphylococcus aureus was studied. RESULTS: High frequency (55.5 - 72.7%) of potentiating of antagonism of lactobacilli with medium and high level of hydrogen peroxide production under the effect of supernatants of corynebacteria inhibiting catalase was established. The frequency of potentiation of antagonism of lactobacilli and corynebacteriae depended on the intensity of hydrogen peroxide production and on the ability of corynebacteria to suppress catalase of staphylococci. CONCLUSION: Potentiation of antagonism to S. aureus of peroxide producing lactobacilli and corynebacteria with catalase inhibitors gives evidence on realization of oxidative bacterial mechanism of colonization resistance in human organism.
