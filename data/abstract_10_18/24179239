This paper identifies common poultry diseases requiring antimicrobial therapy, antimicrobials deemed efficacious to treat these diseases, and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in these commodity-pathogen combinations, and describes current residue issues and minor use minor species (MUMS) guidelines. Veterinarians with turkey/layer expertise and diagnosticians were surveyed to determine the bacterial and protozoal diseases diagnosed in the last 5 years. Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale were the 3 most frequently diagnosed pathogens of turkeys. In layers, E. coli-peritonitis, and Clostridium perfringens/Eimeria spp. infections were the most common diagnoses. A literature review identified 32 antimicrobials as efficacious and/or recommended for treating these diseases. Surveillance and monitoring indicate the presence of enteric resistant organisms from some of these avian species (including resistance to antimicrobials of very high importance to human medicine). This paper highlights the need for surveillance of pathogen frequency, antimicrobial use (AMU), and AMR particularly in turkeys.
