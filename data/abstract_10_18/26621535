BACKGROUND: Currently, there are no conclusive results on the efficacy of Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) monotherapy in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with lamivudine-resistant (LAM-R). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy between TDF and TDF-based combination therapy against LAM-R HBV in CHB patients. METHODS: Randomized and non-randomized control trials directly comparing TDF and TDF-based therapy for treatment of LAM-R CHB patients, were searched in Pubmed, Medline, EMBASE, database up to June 15, 2015. The data were analyzed with Review Manager (v.5.3). RESULTS: Five articles (683 patients in total) met entry criteria. The overall efficacy of tenofovir-based combination therapy was not significantly better with regard to the rates of virological response (85.5% vs. 81.5%; RR=0.95, 95%CI=0.88-1.03, P=0.25), ALT normalization (61.9% vs.72.0%; RR=1.18, 95%CI=0.96-1.44, P=0.11) and HBeAg loss (17.0% vs. 18.1%; RR=1.40, 95%CI=0.78-2.49, P=0.26) compared with TDF monotherapy through 48-week treatment. Additionally, subgroup analysis showed that no significant difference was determined as TDF group compared to TDF-based group at 48weeks, in terms of rates of HBV DNA undetectability, ALT normalization and HBeAg loss in the treatment of LAM-R patients with prior failure of LAM monotherapy. Moreover, the rates of HBV DNA suppression between groups were similar through 24 or 48weeks of treatment in LAM-R patients with prior failure of LAM/ADV therapy. CONCLUSIONS: TDF monotherapy is as effective as TDF-based combination therapy in maintaining viral suppression in LAM-R patients with prior failure of LAM or LAM/ADV therapy.
