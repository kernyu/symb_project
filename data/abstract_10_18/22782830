Gonorrhea is a continuing problem worldwide particularly in terms of the spread of multiple drug resistance. We have successfully developed an efficient PCR method for the simultaneous identification of gonococci and detection of the antimicrobial-resistant profile. By this method, penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae (PPNG), high-level tetracycline-resistant N. gonorrhoeae (TRNG), and ciprofloxacin-resistant N. gonorrhoeae (CRNG) can be clearly identified. Moreover, the plasmid-types of penicillin and tetracycline resistance are also characterized. The method has 100 % sensitivity and specificity. It is also time- and labor-saving compared to the conventional method. Thus, the procedure is suitable for epidemiological surveillance.
