Sugary maize soluble starch particles were modified by using a combined beta-amylase and transglucosidase reaction, and their molecular fine structure and susceptibility to digestive enzymes were investigated. After the dual enzyme treatment, the molecular weight of starch particle decreased from 2.08 x 10(7) to 0.96 x 10(7)g/mol accompanied by the appearance of DP 2-5 chains and the degradation of DP > 12 chains, and the percentage of alpha-1,6 linkages increased from 8.1 to 21.7%. The digestion behaviour of enzyme-treated starch was correlated with the quantity of shorter chains and increased alpha-1,6 linkages. The data revealed that maize soluble starches subjected to a combined beta-amylase and transglucosidase treatment for 60 min or greater, produced novel, highly branched nano-particles with slow digestion and resistance characteristics, which could be used as a potential delivery carrier for functional food components.
