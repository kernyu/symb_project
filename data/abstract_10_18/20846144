The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Yhl035p/Vmr1p is an ABC transporter of the MRP subfamily that is conserved in all post Whole Genome Duplication species. The deletion of the YHL035 gene caused growth sensitivity to several amphiphilic drugs such as cycloheximide, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 2,4-dinitrophenol as well as to cadmium and other toxic metals. Vmr1p-GFP was located in the vacuolar membrane. The ATP-dependent transport of a DNP-S-glutathione conjugate was reduced in a vesicular fraction from the VMR1 deletant. The energy-dependent efflux of rhodamine 6G was increased by VMR1 deletion. Growth sensitivity to cadmium of the VMR1-deleted strain was more pronounced in glycerol/ethanol than in glucose-grown cells. The VMR1 promoter had higher activity when grown in glycerol/ethanol compared with glucose. In glucose, the VMR1 promoter was activated by the deletion of the glucose-dependent repressor ADR1.
