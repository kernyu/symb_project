Chloroquine (CQ) has been used as first line malaria therapeutic drug for decades. Emergence of CQ drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria throughout endemic areas of the world has limited its clinical value. Mefloquine (MQ) has been used as an effective malaria prophylactic drug due to its being long-acting and having a high potency against blood stage P. falciparum (Pf). However, serious CNS toxicity of MQ has compromised its clinical value as a prophylaxis drug. Therefore, new and inexpensive antimalarial drugs with no cross-resistance to CQ or CNS toxicity are urgently needed to combat this deadly human disease. In this study, a series of new 4-amidinoquinoline (4-AMQ) and 10-amidinobenzonaphthyridine (10-AMB) derivatives were designed, prepared, and assessed to search for new therapeutic agents to replace CQ and MQ. The new derivatives displayed high activity in vitro and in vivo, with no cross-resistance to CQ, and none were toxic in mice up to 160 mpk x 3. The best compound shows IC50 < 1 ng/mL against D6, W2 and C235 Pf clones, low inhibitory activity in hERG K(+) channel blockage testing, negativity in the Ames test, and 5/5 cure @ <15 mpk x 3 in mice infected with Plasmodium berghei. In addition to these desirable pharmacological profiles, compound 13b, one of the most active compounds, is metabolically stable in both human and mouse liver microsomal preparations and has a plasma t(1/2) of 50 h in mice, which made it a good MQ replacement candidate.
