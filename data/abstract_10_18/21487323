OBJECTIVES: Earlier studies that dealt with the combination therapy of gemcitabine and histone deacetylation inhibitors for pancreatic cancer revealed unsatisfactory results. The activation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) was referred as one of the attributable causes, and we attempted to overcome this resistance by the addition of a proteasome inhibitor. METHODS: The influences of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (vorinostat, SAHA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, and bortezomib, a novel selective antagonist of 26S proteasome, with or without gemcitabine on cell growth and apoptosis and the expressions of related proteins were observed in pancreatic cancer cell lines (MiaPaCa-2 and ASPC-1). The xenograft model of pancreatic cancer was used to notice effects in vivo. RESULTS: Vorinostat and bortezomib had independent inhibitory effects and potentiated the antitumor property of gemcitabine in vitro. In the xenograft model, more augmented effects were achieved when bortezomib was combined with gemcitabine than gemcitabine alone. The down-regulation of pAkt and suppression of NF-kappaB activity was induced by the triple combination. CONCLUSIONS: The triple combination of vorinostat, bortezomib, and gemcitabine resulted in the strongest antitumor effects both in vitro and in vivo and pAkt and NF-kappaB seems to be involved in this process.
