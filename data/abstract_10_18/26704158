OBJECTIVE: To investigate the spectrum and antimicrobial resistance of major pathogensthat causing nosocomial infections in China, 2013. METHODS: Nosocomial cases as well as pathogens causing bloodstream infections (BSI), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and intra-abdominal infections (IAI) from 13 teaching hospital around China were collected. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the agar dilution method. The CLSI M100-S23 criteria were used for interpretation. RESULTS: Of all cases, 1 022 cases were from BSI, 683 from HAP and 674 from IAI.Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most prevalent pathogens causing BSI and IAI while Acinetobacter baumanii (34.6%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were dominated in HAP. Tigecycline, imipenem and meropenem exhibited high potency against Enterobacteriaceae and the susceptibilities rates were 95.6%, 94.2%and 95.2% respectively. Enterobacteriaceae demonstrated high resistance against cephalosporins (52.3%) and fluoroquinolones (38.9%) but were susceptible to beta-lactam+inhibitor. Of all the Enterobacteriaceae, 30.5% were ESBLs positive and 4.3% were carbapenem resistant. Acinetobacter baumanii showed low susceptibilities to the microbial agents except for tigecycline (90.5%) and colistin (100%). The rate of carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumanii was 76.6%. Amikacin, ciprofloxacin, cefepime and piperacillin/tazobactam showed high antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with susceptible rate 88.5%, 77.6%, 72.7% and 64.5% respectively. The resistant rate to imipenem and meropenem were 42.1% and 32.2%. All Staphylococcus aureus (166 strains) were susceptible to tigecycline, linezolid, daptomycin and glycopeptides. MRSA accounted for 46.9% of all the Staphylococcus aureus. The prevalence of MRSA in IAI (55.2%) and HAP (54.4%) were higher that that in BSI (35.0%). No Enterococcus strains were found resistant to tigecycline, linezolid and daptomycin. VRE was found in Enterococcus faecium, accounting for 1.9% of all Enterococcus faecium strains. CONCLUSIONS: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most common pathogens causing nosocomial infections. Nosocomial pathogens showed high susceptibilities against tigecycline. For ESBLs-producing Enterobacteriaceae strains, beta-lactam+Inhibitor show high antibacterial activities. Vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid exhibit high potency to Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus.
