The infections give rise to a range of clinical problems and prolong hospitalization with increased healthcare costs. Moreover, persistent infections exasperate the problem of antibiotic resistance. The aim of this study was the development of effective and low-cost antibacterial silver coatings on surgical sutures by adopting an innovative photochemical deposition process to prevent early contamination of surgical wounds. The silver deposition technology adopted in this work is an innovative process based on the in situ photoreduction of a silver solution. The samples were dipped in the silver solution and then exposed to UV radiation in order to induce the synthesis of silver clusters on the surface of the suture. The homogeneous distribution of silver particles on the surface and on the cross-section of the treated sutures was demonstrated. All the antibacterial studies clearly demonstrated that the use of novel silver treated sutures could represent clinical advantages in terms of the prevention of surgical infections against bacterial colonization. The silver coating deposited on the sutures demonstrated no cytotoxic effect on a selected cell population. The results obtained suggested that the antibacterial silver-coated sutures developed in this work could represent an interesting alternative to conventional sutures, with evident advantages in terms of prevention of the surgical infections and on the health costs. In addiction, very low concentrations of silver significantly inhibited the microbial load, without affecting the cell viability.
