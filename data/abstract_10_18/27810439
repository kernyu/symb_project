Following up the SAR study of triazolothiadiazoles for their antitubercular activities targeting Mt SD in our previous study, on the principle of scaffold hopping, the C3 and C6 positions of triazolothiadiazine were examined systematically to define a preliminary structure-activity relationship (SAR) with respect to biological activity. This study herein highlights the potential of two highly potent advanced leads 6c-3, 6g-3 and several other compounds with comparable potencies as promising new candidates for the treatment of TB (6c-3, MIC-H37Rv=0.25mug/mL; MIC-MDRTB=2.0mug/mL; MIC-RDRTB=0.25mug/mL; Mt SD-IC50=86.39mug/mL; and 6g-3, MIC-H37Rv=1.0mug/mL; MIC-MDRTB=4.0mug/mL; MIC-RDRTB=2.0mug/mL; Mt SD-IC50=73.57mug/mL). Compounds 6c-3 and 6g-3 possessed a para-nitro phenyl at the 6 position showed low Vero and HepG2 cells toxicity, turning out to be two excellent lead candidates for preclinical trials. In addition, in vitro Mt SD inhibitory assay indicates that Mt SD is at least one of the targets for their antitubercular activity. Thus, they may turn out to be promising multidrug-resistance-reversing agents.
