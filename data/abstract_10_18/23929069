BACKGROUND: Few studies have investigated the emergence of multidrug resistance to adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) plus lamivudine (LAM) combination therapy for patients with LAM-refractory chronic hepatitis B (CHB). In this retrospective study, we investigated the long-term clinical course of these patients with or without multidrug resistance mutations. METHODS: We analyzed 406 Japanese patients with LAM-refractory CHB treated with combination therapy with follow-up for a median of 5.4 (0.5-9.5) years. Multidrug resistance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA was analyzed using direct sequencing or cloning methods at baseline and viral breakthrough or insufficient decline during combination therapy. RESULTS: Ratio of patients with undetectable serum HBV DNA levels (<2.6 log copies/mL) during combination therapy was 63, 72, 75, 79, 82, 80 and 85 % at years 1 through 7, respectively. Substitutions associated with multidrug resistance were identified in 11 patients (2.7 %) at baseline, and in 12 patients (3 %) during therapy. HBV DNA levels of patients with rtA181S mutation at baseline and emergence of rtA181T + rtN236T double mutation or a wide variety of mutations during combination therapy could not be suppressed. Moreover, using ultra-deep sequencing, rtA181T/V mutations were detected at baseline in 7 of 10 patients with emergent multidrug resistance during combination therapy, although 6 of these 7 patients had very low frequency (<1 %) variants. CONCLUSION: Long-term ADV plus LAM combination therapy is effective in LAM-refractory patients. However, HBV DNA levels of the patients with multidrug resistance at baseline or during combination therapy sometimes could not achieve complete suppression or were re-elevated after a decrease.
