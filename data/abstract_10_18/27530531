This study analyzed the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of urogenital Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis isolated in Xi'an, China. A total of 2161 individuals from 2011 to 2015 were included, and antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed by using the Mycoplasma IST kit. Of the individuals studied, 1018 (47.11 %) were identified to be positive for urogenital mycoplasmas. The single U. urealyticum, single M. hominis, and dual U. urealyticum and M. hominis infections accounted for 772 (75.83 %), 66 (6.48 %), and 180 (17.68 %), respectively. The total positive rate was higher in females than in males (58.76 % vs. 28.86 %, p < 0.001). The highest total positive rate (48.88 %) was observed in individuals aged 25 years to 30 years. In symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, the positive rates were both higher in females than in males (67.36 % vs. 31.02 %, p < 0.001 and 42.58 % vs. 7.69 %, p < 0.001, respectively) and individuals aged 25 years to 30 years, and those aged 30 years to 35 years had the highest positive rates (54.35 and 57.14 %, respectively). The U. urealyticum and M. hominis identified from single or dual infections displayed low resistance rates to josamycin, doxycycline, and minocycline (<10 %) in both the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups. These results suggest that females and individuals with symptoms and younger age had higher mycoplasma infection rates and that josamycin, doxycycline, and minocycline may be recommended for the clinical treatment of patients infected with urogenital mycoplasmas, irrespective of the symptoms.
