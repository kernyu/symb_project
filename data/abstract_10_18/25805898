Cholera, a known diarrheal disease is associated with various risk factors like hypovolemic shock, rice watery stools, and death in developing countries. The overuse of antibiotics to treat cholera imposed a selective pressure for the emergence and spread of multi-drug resistant Vibrio cholerae strains. The failure of conventional antimicrobial therapy urged the researchers to find an alternative therapy that could meddle the cholera murmurs (Quorum Sensing). It seems to effectively overcome the conventional cholera therapies in parallel to decrease the morbidity and mortality rate in the developing countries. The paramount objective of this review essentially focuses on the different Quorum Sensing (QS) regulatory switches governing virulence and pathogenicity of Vibrio cholerae. This review also provides an insight into the plausible QS targets that could be exploited to bring about a breakthrough to the prevailing cholera therapy.
