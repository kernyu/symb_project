Patients with chronic kidney disease have increased risk of infections. Thus, physicians may favour prolonged broad-spectrum antibiotic use. Studies focused on antimicrobial stewardship programmes (ASPs) in renal patients are currently lacking. Here we describe the role of a multidisciplinary ASP and the impact of ASP interventions in renal patients. A multidisciplinary ASP was initiated at a tertiary hospital in Singapore. Patients prescribed broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotics were identified daily and were subjected to prospective review with immediate concurrent feedback. ASP data from January 2010 to December 2011 were analysed for all renal patients. Outcome measures included the duration and appropriateness of antibiotics, intervention acceptance rates, cost savings and safety outcomes. A total of 2084 antibiotic courses were reviewed, of which 24% were inappropriate, with meropenem most commonly prescribed inappropriately (31.0%). The commonest reasons for inappropriate use were wrong choice (51.0%) and wrong duration (21.4%). In total, 634 recommendations were made, with high acceptance rates (73.3%). Recommendations to discontinue antibiotics (33.4%) and to optimise doses (17.2%) comprised the bulk of ASP work. A mean reduction of -1.28 days of antibiotic use was observed among patients with interventions accepted versus those rejected (P<0.001), with direct cost savings of SGD$90,045. No difference in 30-day mortality (P=0.91) was observed between the accepted and rejected intervention groups. In conclusion, a multidisciplinary ASP resulted in a shorter duration of antibiotic use without compromising safety in renal patients. Continued effort is needed to produce a long-term impact on antibiotic prescription and resistance.
