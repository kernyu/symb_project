Echinocandins are the recommended treatment for invasive candidiasis due to Candida glabrata. Resistance to echinocandins is known to be caused by nonsynonymous mutations in the hot spot-1 (HS1) regions of the FKS1 and FKS2 genes, which encode a subunit of the beta-1,3-glucan synthase, the target of echinocandins. Here, we describe the development of a microsphere-based assay using Luminex MagPix technology to identify mutations in the FKS1 HS1 and FKS2 HS1 domains, which confer in vitro echinocandin resistance in C. glabrata isolates. The assay is rapid and can be performed with high throughput. The assay was validated using 102 isolates that had FKS1 HS1 and FKS2 HS1 domains previously characterized by DNA sequencing. The assay was 100% concordant with DNA sequencing results. The assay was then used for high-throughput screening of 1,032 C. glabrata surveillance isolates. Sixteen new isolates with mutations, including a mutation that was new to our collection (del659F), were identified. This assay provides a rapid and cost-effective way to screen C. glabrata isolates for echinocandin resistance.
