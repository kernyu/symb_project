We collected 200 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from dogs and cats in primary veterinary hospitals in Japan to investigate their antimicrobial resistance. Resistance rates against ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime, gentamicin, amikacin, and fosfomycin were 9%, 12.5%, 4.5%, 2.5%, and 35.5%, respectively. One strain displayed resistance (0.5%) to ceftazidime. We did not detect any imipenem-resistant or multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa strains as defined by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare Law Concerning the Prevention of Infections and Medical Care for Patients with Infections. In addition, we did not find any P. aeruginosa isolates that produced metallo-beta-lactamase, the aminoglycoside 6'-N-acetyltransferase AAC(6')-Iae, or the aminoglycoside acetyltransferase AAC(6')-Ib.
