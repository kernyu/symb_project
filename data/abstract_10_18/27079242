Infections caused by carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to tigecycline, colistin, or aminoglycosides are a growing health concern. In our retrospective chart review, we noted increased resistance to colistin compared with tigecycline, despite limited prior use of colistin. This may affect the choice of presumptive antibiotics used in these hard to treat infections. Improved infection control and antimicrobial stewardship practices are essential to prevent the spread of these multidrug-resistant organisms.
