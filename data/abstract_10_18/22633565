Failure of vancomycin in the treatment of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteraemia has been reported despite full susceptibility of the organism to vancomycin. A retrospective observational cohort study including 137 patients with MRSA bacteraemia was performed at two centres in South Korea during 2009-2010. A total of 137 patients with MRSA bacteraemia receiving vancomycin therapy were enrolled during the study period. Isolates from 13 (9.5%) of the 137 patients had minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) >/=1 mug/mL. The 30-day cumulative survival was 53.8% for patients infected with isolates having a MIC>/=1 mug/mL and 79.8% for patients infected with isolates having a MIC<1 mug/mL (log-rank test, P=0.026). Vancomycin MIC>/=1 mug/mL [hazard ratio (HR)=7.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.2-22.1; P=0.001], nosocomial acquisition of bacteraemia (HR=5.4, 95% CI 1.4-20.1; P=0.013), rapidly fatal underlying diseases (HR=20.5, 95% CI 3.9-106.4; P<0.001), presentation with septic shock (HR=8.4, 95% CI 3.0-23.3; P<0.001), presence of complicated infections (HR=5.6, 95% CI 2.0-15.8; P=0.001) and persistent MRSA bacteraemia for >/=3 days (HR=4.2, 95% CI 1.4-12.7; P=0.012) were independent predictors of 30-day mortality in patients with MRSA bacteraemia. In patients with high Pitt bacteraemia scores (Pitt score >/=2), the delay in initiation of vancomycin therapy was significantly different between non-survivors and survivors (2.4 days vs. 1.1 days; P=0.012). Vancomycin MIC>/=1 mug/mL had a significant impact on mortality of patients with MRSA bacteraemia. These findings support early consideration of alternative anti-MRSA agents in patients with MRSA bacteraemia who have high vancomycin MICs as well as prompt initiation of anti-MRSA treatment in patients with MRSA bacteraemia, especially those with high Pitt scores.
