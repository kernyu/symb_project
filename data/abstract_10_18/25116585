Most of the people suffering malaria do not know how complex is that disease and how hard searchers are working to fight against it. Some of these people are dying from malaria while still efficient drug combinations should have save their lives. But these drugs were not available for them when needed, or the diagnosis was wrong, or the drugs were fake, or the doctor was untrained, or the patient had no money. Should this terrible reality preclude the need for continuous research to develop new antimalarial drugs? Should people working in laboratories located in non-endemic countries adapt their project to that reality? Malaria eradication, then elimination was announced and broadcasted in the late sixties, and later forgotten. From that failure due to chloroquine resistance and after decades of less arrogant work, billions of dollars are on the table again to claim this goal. There were bed nets, drugs, vaccine and communication as starters, let's hope people in endemic countries will be winners.
