OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to characterize molecularly multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates collected from burn center (BC) patients and environment in a hospital localized in Rio de Janeiro city, RJ, Brazil. METHODS: Thirty-five P. aeruginosa isolates were studied. The antimicrobial resistance was tested by disk diffusion method as recommended by CLSI. The assessment of virulence (exoS and exoU) and resistance (blaPER-1, blaCTX-M, blaOXA-10, blaGES-1, blaVIM, blaIMP, blaSPM-1, blaKPC, blaNDM and blaSIM) genes were achieved through PCR and biofilm forming capacity was determined using a microtiter plates based-assay, as described previously. Genotyping was performed using Multilocus sequence typing (MLST). RESULTS: High rate of P. aeruginosa (71.4%; 25/35) were classified as MDR, of them 64% (16/25) were related to clone A, the most prevalent clone found in the BC studied. A total of eight carbapenems resistant isolates were detected; three belonging to clone A and five carrying the exoU virulence gene. In addition, clone A isolates were also biofilm producers. Two new sequence types (ST) were detected in this study: ST2236, grouped in to clone A; and ST2237, classified in the different clones, displaying carbapenem resistance and exoU virulence gene. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of biofilm producers and multiresistant P. aeruginosa isolates in BC indicates that prevention programs need to be implemented to avoid infection in highly susceptible patients.
