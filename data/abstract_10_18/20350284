The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of ceftriaxone plus vancomycin (Vancoplus) versus ceftriaxone alone against cephalosporin resistant methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strain by using meningitis mice model. The MRSA strain ATCC 43300 was used to induce meningitis in mice. The mice were fed standard pelleted diet and water ad libitum. The test room was air conditioned with temperature 23 +/- 2 degrees C, humidity 65+/- 5% and with artificial fluorescent light 10-14 hrs. of light and dark, respectively. Twenty four mice were divided into four group containing six rats in each group. The ceftriaxone group received 28.57 mg/Kg body weight/day and the vancoplus group received 42.8 mg/Kg body weight/day and control as well as infected group received normal saline. The bacterial susceptibility test in CSF was performed for cephalosporin resistance MRSA strain by determining the lytic zone for the vancoplus and ceftriaxone antibiotic. The lytic zone was more in vancoplus as compared to ceftriaxone. It was also found that activities of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase were significantly increased (p<0.001) along with decreased (p<0.001) in lipid peroxidation (malonaldialdehyde) level in CSF of vancoplus treated group as compared to infected as well as ceftriaxone resistance group and come back to normal level. It was concluded that vancoplus beneficial for the patients who suffered from cephalosporin resistant MRSA bacterial strain.
