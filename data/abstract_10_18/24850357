We compared the performance of the Carba NP test and the Rosco Rapid CARB screen kit for detecting carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both tests are rapid and highly sensitive; however, the Carba NP test showed superior specificity, and several uninterpretable results were observed with the Rapid CARB screen.
