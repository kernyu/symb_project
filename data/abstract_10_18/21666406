Risk factors for development of intestinal colonization by imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (IRPA) may differ between those who acquire the organism via patient-to-patient transmission versus by antibiotic selective pressure. The aim of this study was to quantify potential risk factors for the development of IRPA not due to patient-to-patient transmission.
