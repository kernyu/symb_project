Inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), a crucial enzyme required for de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides, is an important target for cancer, bacterial, parasitic and viral infections and autoimmune disorders. Several classes of IMPDH inhibitors are known in the literature. The current review succinctly summarizes the progress made in the design and development of IMPDH inhibitors as antimicrobial agents in last five years or so. The focus is on the inhibitor and enzyme structural features responsible for imparting selectivity for the microbial over the host enzyme. Future perspectives clearly outline the inhibitor design opportunities available in this area to address the present challenges of drug resistance and re-emergence of newer and deadly strains of microbes, posing a serious threat to public.
