The extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene bla(CTX-M-15) was almost ubiquitous in diverse antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli isolated from surface water around Dhaka City, Bangladesh. Forty-eight isolates represented 34 multi-locus sequence types and a variety of plasmid replicons were identified in association with bla(CTX-M-15) and other resistance genes. This water is likely to be an important source of transmissible antibiotic resistance in Bangladesh.
