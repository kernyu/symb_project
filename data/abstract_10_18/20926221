Of the 100 multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from a Korean hospital, 14 isolates that were resistant to all aminoglycosides tested carried 16S rRNA methylase gene armA. Fourteen armA-positive isolates were classified into 8 pulsotypes. Seven armA-positive isolates cocarried bla(IMP-1). This study is the first report of occurrence of armA in P. aeruginosa.
