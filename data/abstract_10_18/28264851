In this study, we report a novel mcr-1 gene variant, named mcr-1.6, carried by an IncP plasmid in a colistin-resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium isolate from a healthy person. Compared with mcr-1, the mcr-1.6 gene contains two single-nucleotide polymorphisms, one of which results in an arginine to histidine variation (Arg536-->His). The plasmid carrying the mcr-1.6 gene was designated pMCR1.6_P053 and is similar to a recently discovered mcr-1-bearing plasmid found in Klebsiella pneumoniae.
