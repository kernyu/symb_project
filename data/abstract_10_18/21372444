BACKGROUND/AIM: Ecabet sodium has an anti-H. pylori effect. We assessed the efficacy of ecabet sodium in the rescue therapy for the eradication of H. pylori. METHODS: A total of 74 patients with failed eradication of H. pylori after triple therapy with lansoprazole 30 mg bid, amoxicillin 750 mg bid and clarithromycin 200 mg bid were enrolled. They were randomly assigned to the three treatment groups as follows: LAC, lansoprazole 30 mg + amoxicillin 750 mg + clarithromycin 200 mg bid for 1 week; LAC2E, lansoprazole 30 mg bid + amoxicillin 750 mg bid + clarithromycin 200 mg bid + ecabet sodium 2 g bid for 1 week; and LA2E, lansoprazole 30 mg bid + amoxicillin 750 mg bid + ecabet sodium 2 g bid for 2 weeks. Eradication of H. pylori was assessed by the 13C-urea breath test after treatment. RESULTS: Eradication rates in intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were 20.0% (95% CI: 6.8-40.7) and 20.0% (6.8-40.7) with LAC, respectively, and 16.0% (4.5-36.1) and 17.4% (5.0-38.8) with LAC2E. In contrast, respective rates with LA2E were 75% (53.3-90.2) and 85.7% (63.7-97.0), which were significantly higher than those with LAC (p<0.001 for both ITT and PP) and LAC2E (p<0.001 for both ITT and PP). CONCLUSION: Triple therapy with ecabet sodium, lansoprazole and amoxicillin for 2 weeks was effective as the rescue therapy after failure of the standard clarithromycin-based regimen.
