INTRODUCTION: Rising concerns about antimicrobial resistance and inadequate development of effective new anti-infective drugs have stimulated universal efforts to strengthen infection-control interventions. Antimicrobial stewardship is a rational, systematic approach to promote the optimal selection, dosing, and duration of therapy for antimicrobial agents throughout the course of their use in order to improve the outcomes. AIM: Since in Shree Krishna Hospital (SKH), Antibiotic Stewardship Program (ASP) was first implemented in 2013, this study was planned to assess any change in antimicrobial use before and after implementation of ASP and to study the rate and pattern of antimicrobial use in medical ICU. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 12 bedded medical intensive care unit, over a period of two years from October 2014 to October 2016 at SKH. Permission was taken from Institutional Human Research Ethics Committee. Total 150 case files i.e., 75 from year 2012 and 75 from year 2015 were retrieved from medical record section of the hospital. Appropriateness of prescriptions was decided on the basis of appropriateness of choice, dose, frequency and duration of antimicrobial agents. Data were analysed by using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: There were 68.67% males and the mean (+/-SD) age was 57.11 (+/-16.83) years. Majority of the patients were suffering from respiratory conditions. The most common group of drugs prescribed in MICU was beta-lactam antibiotics + beta-lactamase inhibitors during 2012 as well as 2015. Total 139 patients i.e., 69 (92%) patients in 2012 and 70 (93.33%) patients in 2015 were given antimicrobial for therapeutic purpose. During the year 2015, 67 (89.33%) antimicrobial prescriptions were adhering to antibiotic policy of SKH. Appropriateness of prescriptions had significantly improved in 2015 in MICU (p-value=0.031). CONCLUSION: In-depth analysis of the study revealed a positive impact of ASP and antibiotic policy. Implementation of ASP in year 2013, brought an effective increase in the appropriate use of antimicrobials.
