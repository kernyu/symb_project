OBJECTIVE: The aim of this in vitro study was to demonstrate the binding capacity of multiple meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains and compare the binding capacity to meticillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. METHOD: The binding of Staphylococcus aureus to a surface was assessed by bioluminescent monitoring of the bacterial ATP levels. This assay can be used as an in vitro diagnostic model for bacteria binding in a critically colonised wound. RESULTS: Eleven strains of Staphylococcus aureus were examined including MRSA, all of which efficiently and equally adhered to the dialkyl carbamoyl chloride (DACC)-coated dressing (Sorbact; Abigo Medical AB). The binding capacity was all in the same range 0.7-2.9 x 10(6) CFU/cm(2). regardless of the antibiotic resistance properties of the specific strain. CONCLUSION: The decrease of wound bioburden of Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA is the result of the high binding capacity shown in this study and by earlier data. The findings in this study strengthen the held view that development of antibiotic resistance has minimal impact on the surface structures of the microorganisms in wounds.
