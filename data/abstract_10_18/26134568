In many Gram-positive bacteria PerR is a major peroxide sensor whose repressor activity is dependent on a bound metal cofactor. The prototype for PerR sensors, the Bacillus subtilis PerRBS protein, represses target genes when bound to either Mn(2+) or Fe(2+) as corepressor, but only the Fe(2+)-bound form responds to H2O2. The orthologous protein in the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, PerRSA, plays important roles in H2O2 resistance and virulence. However, PerRSA is reported to only respond to Mn(2+) as corepressor, which suggests that it might rely on a distinct, iron-independent mechanism for H2O2 sensing. Here we demonstrate that PerRSA uses either Fe(2+) or Mn(2+) as corepressor, and that, like PerRBS, the Fe(2+)-bound form of PerRSA senses physiological levels of H2O2 by iron-mediated histidine oxidation. Moreover, we show that PerRSA is poised to sense very low levels of endogenous H2O2, which normally cannot be sensed by B. subtilis PerRBS. This hypersensitivity of PerRSA accounts for the apparent lack of Fe(2+)-dependent repressor activity and consequent Mn(2+)-specific repressor activity under aerobic conditions. We also provide evidence that the activity of PerRSA is directly correlated with virulence, whereas it is inversely correlated with H2O2 resistance, suggesting that PerRSA may be an attractive target for the control of S. aureus pathogenesis.
