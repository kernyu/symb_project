Among hospital-associated infections, healthcare-associated central nervous system infections are quite important because of high morbidity and mortality rates. The causative agents of healthcare-associated meningitis differ according to the status of immune systems and underlying diseases. The most frequent agents are Gram-negative bacilli (Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and Gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci). There are currently several problems in the treatment strategies of healthcare-associated meningitis due to a globally increasing resistance problem. Strategies targeting multidrug-resistant pathogens are especially limited. This review focuses on healthcare-associated meningitis and the current treatment strategies with a particular focus on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) meningitis.
