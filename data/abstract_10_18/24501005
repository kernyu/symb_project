UNLABELLED: This phase II trial assessed the efficacy and safety of a combination regimen of the nonstructural protein (NS)5A inhibitor ledipasvir (LDV), NS3 protease inhibitor vedroprevir (VDV), non-nucleoside NS5B inhibitor tegobuvir (TGV), and ribavirin (RBV) in treatment-naive patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 without cirrhosis. Patients were randomized 1:2 to LDV 30 mg once daily (QD; Arm 1; n = 46) or LDV 90 mg QD (Arm 2; n = 94); patients in both arms also received VDV 200 mg QD, TGV 30 mg twice-daily, and RBV 1,000-1,200 mg/day. Patients in Arm 2 with vRVR, defined as HCV RNA below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) from treatment weeks 2 to 10, were randomized 1:1 to stop treatment at 12 weeks or continue for 24 weeks. Sustained virologic response 12 weeks after treatment (SVR12) was higher in patients receiving 90 mg of LDV for 24 weeks (63%), compared with LDV 90 mg for 12 weeks (54%) and LDV 30 mg for 24 weeks (48%). In patients with very rapid virologic response (vRVR) in Arm 2, SVR12 was achieved by 68% and 81% of patients treated for 12 and 24 weeks, respectively. Virologic breakthrough was more common in patients with HCV genotype 1a and was associated with resistance-associated variants for all three direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs); however, in all but 1 patient who relapsed, resistance-associated variants directed against only one or two of the DAAs were detected. The most common adverse events were fatigue, headache, nausea, rash, and diarrhea. CONCLUSION: In patients with HCV genotype 1, an interferon-free regimen containing LDV/VDV/TGV/RBV was well tolerated and led to SVR12 in up to 63% of patients. LDV 90 mg is currently being investigated in combination with the nucleotide polymerase inhibitor, sofosbuvir.
