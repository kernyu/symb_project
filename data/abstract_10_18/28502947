Mycobacterium abscessus infection tends to occur in patients with an advanced immunocompromised status. We encountered a case of intractable cutaneous M. abscessus infection that developed in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) during maintenance therapy. A 28-year-old woman developed a fever and redness of the skin on her buttocks. General antibacterial therapy was ineffective, and acid-fast bacteria were detected in the biopsy that was conducted to differentiate the dermal symptoms of SLE. The clinical findings eventually improved; however, the symptoms recurred multiple times during treatment. Despite recent advances in SLE treatment, M. abscessus infection remains a considerable complication of SLE.
