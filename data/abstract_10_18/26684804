Pancreatic adenocarcinoma upregulated factor (PAUF) is a new oncogene that activates signaling pathways that play a critical role in resistance to gemcitabine. We thus speculated that PAUF also plays a role in resistance to gemcitabine of pancreatic cancer cells. We established BxPC-3 cell lines with stable PAUF knockdown (BxPC-3_shPAUF) and controls (BxPC-3_shCtrl) and evaluated sensitivity to gemcitabine in vitro by MTT and flow cytometry. We established a xenograft model of human pancreatic cancer to examine PAUF function in gemcitabine resistance in vivo. Gene chip microarrays were performed to identify differentially expressed genes in BxPC-3_shPAUF and BxPC-3_shCtrl cells. Silencing PAUF increased the sensitivity of BxPC-3 cells to gemcitabine in vitro and in vivo. PAUF-knockdown BxPC-3 cell lines treated with gemcitabine showed increased proliferation inhibition and apoptosis compared with controls. Gemcitabine exhibited a more pronounced effect on reduction of BxPC-3_shPAUF tumors than BxPC-3_shCtrl tumors. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) assays confirmed a significantly higher apoptotic rate of BXPC-3_shPAUF tumors compared with BXPC-3_shCtrl tumors. Gene array showed that PAUF function in gemcitabine sensitivity might involve MRP2, MRP3, MDR1, PIK3R1, and NFkB2 genes. PAUF could be considered as a key molecular target for sensitizing pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine.
