The results of the streptomycin sensitivity changes of phytopathogenic Pseudomonas syringae and Xanthomonas translucens bacteria under the action of pesticides are pre- sented. It is demonstrated that phytopathogenic strains show greater changes of strepto- mycin sensitivity compared to epiphytic Pantoea agglomerans strain under the pesticides influence. Granstar herbicide, Tviks and Alpha Super insecticides increase the number of streptomycin resistant cells of Xanthomonas translucens 3164, P syringae pv. syringae YKM B-1027 and P syringae pv. atrofaciens YKM B-1011. This fact indicates mutagenic action of these pesticides against researched phytopathogenic bacteria.
