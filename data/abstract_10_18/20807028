This study presents data on species distribution and antifungal susceptibility profiles of Candida bloodstream isolates obtained from a Turkish Tertiary Care Hospital during a 4-year period. All hospitalized patients who had >/= 1 blood culture positive for yeast during their hospital stay from January 2005 through 2009 were included in this study. All isolates were identified to species level using CHROMagar and ID 32 C. Fluconazole and voriconazole antifungal susceptibility testing was performed using the disk diffusion method according to CLSI M44-A. In vitro activity of amphotericin B was determined by the Etest. Of all 166 yeast isolates, C. albicans was the dominant species (34.3%), followed by Candida parapsilosis (28.9%) and C. tropicalis (8.4%). All of the 48 C. parapsilosis strains were identified as C. parapsilosis sensu stricto. Resistance to fluconazole was more common among C. krusei isolates. Voriconazole resistance was absent. One C. lusitaniae strain showed a high amphotericin MIC (4 mug/ml). Our survey indicated an increase of some non-C. albicans Candida species in our hospital while antifungal resistance was uncommon.
