Infections with multidrug-resistant organisms are a growing problem in lung transplant recipients. Carriage of drug-resistant bacteria and fungi before transplantation is an important risk factor for such infections. In that regard Pseudomonas aeruginosa and species of Burkholderia, Acinetobacter, non-tuberculous mycobacteria and Scedosporium are particularly important. An understanding of the impact of these organisms is essential to the evaluation of lung transplant candidates. The microbiology, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and approach to these pathogens before transplant are reviewed in this article.
