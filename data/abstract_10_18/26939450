Because the integrase of class 1 integron in bacteria has been demonstrated closely relative with antimicrobial resistance, we summarize in this review the discussions on some regulation factors with expression of the integrase, such as antibiotics, carbon catabolite repression (cAMP-CRP complex), the promoter of gene cassette variants (Pc-P2 combinations), attC sites, some nucleotide-associated proteins, and the length of variable region. Furthermore, we also provide knowledge of the regulation mechanism of integrase, as well as insight into controlling the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance in the environments.
