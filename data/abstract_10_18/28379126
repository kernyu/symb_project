Background Community acquired urinary tract infections (caUTI) in adults are common ailments. Older adults are prone to infectious diseases, diagnosis can be difficult, their etiologic and antimicrobial resistance are poorly known. Objectives To evaluate the incidence discriminated by sex, symptoms, and to determine pathogens and their antimicrobial resistance rate. Methods A retrospective, descriptive and comparative study. We analyze uricultures among 2013 in the Hospital Nacional de Clinicas (Cordoba-Argentina). Patients over 65 years old, admitted with a caUTI diagnose were included; we exclude those with urinary catheter. Variables used: Sex, symptoms, pathogen isolation, antimicrobial resistance. For symptom variable was performed a comparative test. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze remaining variables. Results Were analyzed 349 patients: 1) Positive uricultures 191 (case), negative 158 (control). 2) Average age 77 (76% women, 24% men). 3) Symptoms: fever (45%), sepsis criteria (17%), altered mental status (14%), heart failure (11%). 4) Uriculture: monomicrobial 95.29%. 5) Isolation and resistance rate: Escherichia coli (67,7%): ampicillin/sulbactam 52.7%, ciprofloxacin 51.9%, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 45.7%, cefotaxime: 12,9 %, amikacin: 3,9 %, Klebsiella pneumoniae (11,97%): ciprofloxacin 60.8%, trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole 50%, cefotaxime 47.8%, amikacin 4.7%. Enterococcus spp. (9,89%): ampicillin 0%, vancomycin 0%. Also isolated: Candida spp. (3.66%), Proteus mirabilis (2,6%), Staphylococcus aureus (2,6%), Enterobacter cloacae (1,56%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1,56%). There were no imipenem resistances among gram negatives. Conclusions Isolations were mostly monomicrobial and at female gender. E. coli was the main uropathogen. The elevated resistance rate to ciprofloxacin, ampicillin/sulbactam and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is remarkable. We suggest to avoid their empiric use in this population.
