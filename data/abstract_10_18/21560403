We investigated the distribution of drug-resistant organisms to clarify transmission of the organisms. Drug-resistant organisms were surveyed in 12 facilities in 4 districts of Saga prefecture for 2 years, and were analyzed by beta-lactamase typing, antimicrobial susceptibility tests and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The number of isolates was 111,505 for the 2 years. Questionnaires for drug-resistant organisms revealed that Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was 64.1% of S. aureus, penicillin-intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP) or penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) 60.1% of S. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistent Haemophilus inflluenzae (BLNAR) 19.4% of H. influenzae, Metallo-beta-Lactamase (MBL) 0.1% of gram-negative bacilli, multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRP) 0.6% of P. aeruginosa and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing organisms 8.0% and 3.1% of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, respectively. PFGE analysis of ESBL E. coli revealed that 33 isolates collected from 7 facilities in 3 districts belonged to the same one group, indicating that this strain is transferred between different hospitals in different saga districts. Investigations of distribution of drug-resistant organisms in not only each hospitals but also in the first and the second medical areas are important for controls of healthcare-associated infections and antibiotic prescriptions.
