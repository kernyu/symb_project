OBJECTIVES: To determine the dynamics of serotype prevalence, potential coverage by pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) and antibiotic resistance patterns of Streptococcus pneumoniae causing acute otitis media (AOM) in children in southern Israel before PCV7 introduction in the routine immunization program in Israel. METHODS: All S. pneumoniae isolates from middle ear fluid from children with AOM during 1999-2008 were included. Prospectively collected demographic data on S. pneumoniae serotypes and antibiotic resistance patterns were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 14,911 tympanocenteses yielded 5281 (35%) S. pneumoniae. Proportion of S. pneumoniae-AOM did not vary significantly (overall 35%; 33% in 2007; 38% in 2002 and 2003). The most frequent serotypes were 19F, 14, 23F and 19A; in both Jewish and Bedouin children; serotypes 6A and 19A contributed 6% and 10%, respectively, of all S. pneumoniae isolates. Serotypes included in PCV7, PCV10 and PCV13 represented 60%, 64%, 85% in Jewish children vs. 49%, 55% and 74%, respectively, in Bedouin children (P < 0.001). Nonsusceptibility to TMP/SMX decreased significantly, in parallel with a significant increase in the nonsusceptibility to erythromycin, clindamycin and in multidrug resistant (MDR) isolates. No changes were recorded in the proportion of S. pneumoniae isolates with penicillin MIC >/= 1.0 mug/ml. The proportion of penicillin- and erythromycin-nonsusceptible and of MDR serotype 6A and 19A isolates increased significantly in Bedouin children. CONCLUSIONS: (1) No significant changes were recorded in the yearly proportions of serotypes 23F, 19F, 19A, 14 and 6A in both ethnic populations; (2) Potential coverage of the 3 PCVs was higher in Jewish children than in Bedouin children; (3) The relatively high coverage of macrolides- and multidrug-resistant S. pneumoniae by PCV13 and lack of increase in penicillin, erythromycin and multidrug nonsusceptibility among non-PCV13 isolates is encouraging.
