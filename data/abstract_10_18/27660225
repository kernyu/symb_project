We evaluate the performance of Xpert MTB/RIF for the diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) in China. The performance of Xpert was evaluated compared to the composite reference standard (CRS), drug susceptibility testing (DST), and imaging examination. The overall sensitivity and specificity of Xpert were 64.1% (195/304) and 100% (24/24), respectively, using CRS as the gold standard. The sensitivity was significantly higher than that of culture for pus (P<0.05). The proportion of EPTB-positive cases diagnosed by imaging was two times more than that diagnosed using Xpert; however, 6 out of 19 cases may have been overdiagnosed by imaging. Compared to phenotypic DST, the sensitivity and specificity of Xpert were 80% (12/15) and 100% (75/75), respectively. Considering its high sensitivity and specificity, Xpert MTB/RIF may be used as a rapid initial test for EPTB diagnosis, and may also support a quicker decision on the treatment regimen. The combination of imaging and Xpert testing could provide high efficiency and accurate diagnosis of suspected EPTB.
