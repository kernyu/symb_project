Nanomedicine nowadays offers novel solutions in cancer therapy by introducing multimodal treatments in one single formulation. In addition, nanoparticles act as nanocarriers changing the solubility, biodistribution and efficiency of the therapeutic molecules, thus generating more efficient treatments and reducing their side effects. To apply these novel therapeutic approaches, efforts are focused on the multi-functionalization of the nanoparticles and will open up new avenues to advanced combinational therapies. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a cancer with unmet medical needs. Abundant expression of the anti-phagocytosis signal CD47 has also been observed on pancreatic cancer cells, in particular a subset of cancer stem cells (CSCs) responsible for resistance to standard therapy and metastatic potential. CD47 receptor is found on pancreatic cancer and highly expressed on CSCs, but not on normal pancreas. Inhibiting CD47 using monoclonal antibodies has been shown as an effective strategy to treat PDAC in vivo. However, CD47 inhibition effectively slowed tumor growth only in combination with Gemcitabine or Abraxane. In this work, we present the generation of multifunctionalized iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) that include the anti-CD47 antibody and the chemotherapeutic drug Gemcitabine in a single formulation. We demonstrate the in vitro efficacy of the formulation against CD47-positive pancreatic cancer cells.
