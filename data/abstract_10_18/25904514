Genotyping methods are useful resources for the surveillance, detection, prevention and control of multidrug-resistant nosocomial agents, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). An understanding of the association between genotype and antibiotic susceptibility in MRSA clones may be useful in the surveillance of MRSA and to avoid inappropriate treatment future resistance. We genotyped MRSA clinical isolates from the Extremadura region of Spain using pulsed field electrophoresis (PFGE) and analyzed the spectrum of antibiotic susceptibility for each isolate to determine whether resistance is associated with specific genotypes. PFGE revealed six major genotypes: E8a (25%), E7b (17%), E7a (12%), E8B (8%), E10 (6%), and E20 (4%). Isolates with the genotypes E8a and E10 exhibit higher resistance ratios for levofloxacin than isolates with the other major pulsotypes. Similar results were obtained for isolates with the E20 pulsotype with respect to mupirocin. Although we identified no vancomycin-, tigecycline-, linezolid- or daptomycin-resistant strains, we observed significant differences in the mean MIC values obtained for some of these drugs among the major genotypes. Specifically, isolates with the E7b, E8b, and E20 genotypes have signif-icantly higher MICs of tigecycline, vancomycin and linezolid, respectively, than the most sensitive pulsotypes. Isolates with the E8b profile also exhibit a significantly higher rate of re-duced vancomycin susceptibility (RVS) (i.e., MIC between 1 and 2 mg/L) than clones with the E10 and E8a profiles. In conclusion, we report associations between genotype and antibiotic sensitivity that should be considered in programs for monitor-ing and controlling MRSA in health care settings.
