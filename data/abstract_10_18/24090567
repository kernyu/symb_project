A study has been carried out to investigate whether the action of triclabendazole (TCBZ) against Fasciola hepatica is altered by inhibition of P-glycoprotein (Pgp)-linked drug efflux pumps. The Sligo TCBZ-resistant fluke isolate was used for these experiments and the Pgp inhibitor selected was R(+)-verapamil [R(+)-VPL]. In the first experiment, flukes were initially incubated for 2h in R(+)-VPL (1x10(-4) M), then incubated in R(+)-VPL + triclabendazole sulphoxide (TCBZ.SO) (50mug/ml) until flukes ceased movement (at 9h post-treatment). In a second experiment, flukes were incubated in TCBZ.SO alone and removed from the incubation medium following cessation of motility (after 15h). In the third experiment, flukes were incubated for 24h in R(+)-VPL on its own. Changes to the tegumental system and gut following drug treatment and following Pgp inhibition were assessed by means of light microscope histology and transmission electron microscopy. Incubation of the Sligo isolate in either R(+)-VPL or TCBZ.SO on their own had a limited impact on the tegumental syncytium and tegumental cells; the changes were consistent with a stress response by the fluke to drug action. Greater disruption was observed when the drugs were combined, in terms of the vacuolation and sloughing of the syncytium, spine disruption and the cessation of secretory activity in, and degradation of, the tegumental cells. In the gut, treatment with R(+)-VPL on its own did not lead to any cellular changes. Some limited changes to the mitochondria and the granular endoplasmic reticulum were observed after incubation in TCBZ.SO alone, together with reduced secretory activity and evidence of autophagy. However, these changes were far more pronounced in combination-treated flukes. The results of this study support the concept of altered drug efflux in TCBZ-resistant flukes and indicate that drug transporters may play a role in the development of drug resistance.
