Escherichia coli is a normal inhabitant of the intestinal tract of chickens, but when an imbalance in the gut microbiota occurs, E. coli may overgrow and cause extraintestinal infections. The aims of this study were to assess the distribution and spread of E. coli isolates with specific phylogenetic groups and antimicrobial resistance characters among asymptomatic breeder flocks and their broiler progenies with early symptoms of colibacillosis. Broiler flocks were treated with lincospectin during the first week of life and sampled at one, 21 and 42 days. The majority of the 363 E. coli isolates belonged to phylogenetic group A (53.17%), followed by groups D (23.14%), B1 (19.28%) and B2 (4.41%). In broilers, group A was the most represented in birds of 21 and 42 days of age whereas group B1 was the most represented phylogroup in one-day old chicks. More than 90.00% of the isolates were resistant to one or more antimicrobials. Along the life-time of broilers, no differences were found on the occurrence of resistant isolates except for the number of E. coli with elevated MIC to spectinomycin, which increased significantly after the lincospectin treatment. According to XbaI-macrorestriction analysis, a high genetic diversity among E. coli isolates was underlined. Four antimicrobial resistant E. coli isolates of phylogroups A, B1 and D collected from breeders showed similar PFGE patterns to five isolates collected from the respective broiler progenies suggesting a potential spread of these isolates from breeders to broilers.
