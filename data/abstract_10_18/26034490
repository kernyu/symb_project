BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common bacterium that can cause disease in humans and other animals. This study was conducted to screen for molecular detection and antimicrobial-resistant P. aeruginosa in Musca domestica in different locations in the Iranian provinces of Shahrekord and Isfahan. METHODS: Musca domestica were captured by both manual and sticky trap methods, during the daytime, from household kitchens, cattle farms, animal hospitals, human hospitals, slaughterhouses and chicken farms at random locations in Shahrekord and Isfahan provinces of Iran, and subsequently transported to the laboratory for detection of P. aeruginosa. In the laboratory, flies were identified and killed by refrigeration in a cold chamber at -20 degrees C, then placed in 5 mL peptone water and left at room temperature for five hours before being processed. Pseudomonas isolates were preliminarily identified to genus level based on colony morphology and gram staining, and their identity was further confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Overall blaTEM gene was recovered from 8.8 % (53/600) of the P. aeruginosa isolated from houseflies collected from the two provinces. A slightly higher prevalence (10.7 %; 32/300) was recorded in Shahrekord province than Isfahan province (7.0 %; 21/300). The locations did not differ statistically (p < 0.05) in bacterial prevalence in flies. Seasonal prevalence showed a significantly lower infection frequency during autumn. CONCLUSIONS: Houseflies are important in the epidemiology of P. aeruginosa infections.
