Emerging drug resistance varieties and hyper-virulent strains of microorganisms have compelled the scientific fraternity to develop more potent and less harmful therapeutics. Antimicrobial peptides could be one of such therapeutics. This review is an attempt to explore antifungal peptides naturally produced by prokaryotes as well as eukaryotes. They are components of innate immune system providing first line of defence against microbial attacks, especially in eukaryotes. The present article concentrates on types, structures, sources and mode of action of gene-encoded antifungal peptides such as mammalian defensins, protegrins, tritrpticins, histatins, lactoferricins, antifungal peptides derived from birds, amphibians, insects, fungi, bacteria and their synthetic analogues such as pexiganan, omiganan, echinocandins and Novexatin. In silico drug designing, a major revolution in the area of therapeutics, facilitates drug development by exploiting different bioinformatics tools. With this view, bioinformatics tools were used to visualize the structural details of antifungal peptides and to predict their level of similarity. Current practices and recent developments in this area have also been discussed briefly.
