A novel method to detect resistant faecal Enterobacteriaceae was developed by applying MIC-gradient strips directly onto agar plates inoculated with faeces. The method provided the susceptibility pattern (MICs) of the dominant bacterial population directly on the plates and also detected smaller resistant subpopulations with a sensitivity of 1/10(5).
