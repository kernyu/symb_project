Multidrug resistance is a global threat as the clinically available potent antibiotic drugs are becoming exceedingly scarce. For example, increasing drug resistance among gram-positive bacteria is responsible for approximately one-third of nosocomial infections. As ribosomes are a major target for these drugs, they may serve as suitable objects for novel development of next-generation antibiotics. Three-dimensional structures of ribosomal particles from Staphylococcus aureus obtained by X-ray crystallography have shed light on fine details of drug binding sites and have revealed unique structural motifs specific for this pathogenic strain, which may be used for the design of novel degradable pathogen-specific, and hence, environmentally friendly drugs.
