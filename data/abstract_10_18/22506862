INTRODUCTION: The indiscriminate use of antibiotics associated with other situations has revealed a considerable increase in outbreaks caused by microorganisms resistant to antimicrobial drugs. Among these is the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. AREAS COVERED: This review provides an overview of the KPC-producing K. pneumoniae with emphasis on the epidemiological and clinical aspects. EXPERT OPINION: The KPC-producing K. pneumoniae was first described in the US. Most cases were reported between 2007 and 2009. It is widespread in almost all continents. The presence of severe comorbidities, previous use of fluoroquinolones and broad-spectrum cephalosporin are independent factors for this type of infection. Besides the increasing number of resistant strains that greatly complicates the therapeutic management of patients, the clinical characteristics of infection make the diagnosis difficult, resulting in high morbidity and mortality rates. The spread of KPC-producing K. pneumoniae shows how we are prone to pandemics. Transport systems, the exchange of healthcare professionals, the transfer of patients between hospitals and, mainly, the lack of preventive measures such as hand washing are related to the spread of KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in virtually all continents.
