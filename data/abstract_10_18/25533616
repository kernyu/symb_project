Performance of Vitek2, Etest, and TREK broth microdilution (BMD) panels was evaluated versus reference CLSI BMD for gentamicin susceptibility testing with 57 bloodstream isolates of KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. Compared with reference BMD, the Essential Agreement and Categorical Agreement for TREK panels, Vitek2, and Etest were 91.2%, 31.6%, and 61.4%, respectively, and 86%, 21%, and 52.6%, respectively. Four very major discrepancies occurred with Vitek2. In these 4 strains, gentamicin resistance was associated with the presence of an armA aminoglycoside resistance determinant.
