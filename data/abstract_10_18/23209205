Coxiella burnetii 109, with a 2.03-Mb genome, is a doxycycline-resistant human isolate that was isolated from the cardiac valve of a German male patient with Q fever endocarditis who died during the course of the treatment due to the bacterium's resistance to doxycycline. This new genome can be useful for future comparative genomic or Q fever studies.
