The growing resistance of pathogens to conventional antibiotics has become a public health problem and raises the need to seek new effective solutions. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous, hybrid materials comprising metal ions linked by organic binding ligands. The possibility of using a variety of chemical building components in MOFs enables the formation of structures with desired properties. They can act as a reservoir of metal ions, providing their gradual release and resulting in a sustained antibacterial action analogous to that proposed for metal/metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) but different to that of antibiotics. These features make MOFs promising candidates for pharmaceutical and biomedical applications, as illustrated by examples discussed in this review.
