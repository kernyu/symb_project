Due to the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance and the yet low output of the genomics-based drug discovery approach novel strategies are urgently needed to detect new antibiotics. One such strategy uses known ubiquitous targets like DNA topoisomerases. However, to detect inhibitors of these enzymes by an in vitro assay time-consuming isolation of enzymes and DNA followed by electrophoretic separation of topoisomers are required. Instead, this study aimed at developing an in vivo assay for the detection of alterations in DNA supercoiling indicative of topoisomerase inhibition by a reporter gene assay. A pair of plasmids was developed which carry the reporter gene luc for firefly luciferase under control of either promoter ptopA (pPHB90) or pgyrA (pPHB91), whose activities are reciprocally affected by alterations of the supercoiling degree. Each plasmid is individually transferred into E. coli cells. The quotient of the luciferase activities determined using cells with either plasmid was taken as relative measure of the global supercoiling degree Qsc (quotient of supercoiling). Using isogenic reference strains with known alterations of the global DNA supercoiling degree due to mutations in either gyrB or topA, the reporter gene system was able to detect both a decrease and an increase of the negative supercoiling degree compared to the isogenic parent strain. Treating cells with known inhibitors of DNA gyrase, like fluoroquinolones, novobiocin as well as simocyclinone D8 from Streptomyces antibioticus which has been identified as an inhibitor of DNA gyrase in vitro, also caused decreases of the Qsc value in vivo. The suitability of this reporter gene system to screen for anti-topoisomerase I and II compounds from various natural sources like plant extracts by sensing alterations of the DNA supercoiling was demonstrated and offers a new application to identify novel compounds active against bacterial topoisomerases I and gyrase.
