The increase of extended- spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) in humans and in food-producing animals is of public health concern. The latter could contribute to spreading of these bacteria or their resistance genes to humans. Several studies have reported the isolation of third generation cephalosporin resistant bacteria in livestock animals. However, the number of samples and the methodology used differ considerably between studies limiting comparability and prevalence assessment. In the present study, a total of 564 manure and dust samples were collected from 47 pig farms in Northern Germany and analysed to determine the prevalence of ESBL-E. Molecular typing and characterization of resistance genes was performed for all ESBL-E isolates. ESBL-E isolates were found in 55.3% of the farms. ESBL-Escherichia coli was found in 18.8% of the samples, ESBL-Klebsiella pneumoniae in 0.35%. The most prevalent ESBL genes among E. coli were CTX-M-1 like (68.9%), CTX-M-15 like (16%) and CTX-M-9 group (14.2%). In 20% of the latter two, also the OXA-1 like gene was found resulting in a combination of genes typical for isolates from humans. Genetic relation was found between isolates not only from the same, but also from different farms, with multilocus sequence type (ST) 10 being predominant among the E. coli isolates. In conclusion, we showed possible spread of ESBL-E between farms and the presence of resistance genes and STs previously shown to be associated with human isolates. Follow-up studies are required to monitor the extent and pathways of ESBL-E transmission between farms, animals and humans.
