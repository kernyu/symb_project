This study attempted to examine the relatedness between RAPD-PCR, PFGE and VcA VNTR results with those of conventional phage typing of V. cholerae strains and to evaluate VcA VNTR as an indispensable molecular-typing tool that accomplishes the urgent need for effective epidemiological surveillance. All the O1 El Tor strains were predominantly clustered into phage type T27 with the new phage-typing scheme. Using RAPD-PCR, a total of 69 O1 El Tor strains were grouped under 16 different electrophoretic patterns. A total of 33 pulsotypes were identified in these strains by PFGE. VcA VNTR revealed high VcA polymorphism in all V. cholerae strains incorporated in this study. Our results underline the considerable potential of VcA VNTR analysis as a tool for molecular typing of V. cholerae.
