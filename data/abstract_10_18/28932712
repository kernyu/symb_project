INTRODUCTION: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli (NFGNB), especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp., is one of the main hospital-acquired infections leading to mortality and morbidity, especially in intensive care units (ICUs). This study seeks to determine the multidrug and co-resistance (MDR) patterns of NFGNB that are agents of VAP, and assess the presence of class 1 integron in these bacteria. METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved VAP patients admitted in the ICUs of 18 hospitals in the Mazandaran province, located in the North of Iran. The antibiotic susceptibility pattern was determined by the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test by using broth microdilution method. Presence of class 1 integron was evaluated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. RESULTS: Out of a total of 83 patients who were microbiologically diagnosed as VAP, 52 non-duplicated NFGNBs (24 P. aeruginosa and 28 A. baumannii) were causative of VAP, out of which MDR NFGNBs were responsible for 48 (57.83%) cases. The frequencies of MDR NFGNBs were as follows: 27 (56.25%) A. baumannii and 21 (43.75%) P. aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa isolates were resistant to all aminoglycoside antibiotics (50%), ciprofloxacin (45.8%), ceftazidime (70.8%), cefepime (87.5%), colistin (62.5%), and imipenem (29.2%). A. baumannii isolates were resistant to aminoglycosides (53.6%), ciprofloxacin (85.7%), ceftazidime (92. 9%), cefepime (92.9%), colistin (35.7%), and imipenem (57.1%). Twelve isolates were resistant to all 10 tested antibiotics. The number of rates of class 1 integron, positive for MDR P. aeruginosa and MDR A. baumannii, were 20 (95.23%) and 21 (77.78%), respectively. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of multidrug resistance and incidence of class 1 integron is a therapeutic concern. Employing antibiotic stewardship in hospitals could prevent the dissemination of MDR bacteria.
