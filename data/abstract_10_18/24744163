PURPOSE: TRAIL, a tumor selective anticancer agent, may be used for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, TRAIL resistance is frequently encountered. Here, the combined use of TRAIL with trifluorothymidine (TFT), a thymidylate synthase inhibitor, was examined for sensitizing NSCLC cells to TRAIL. METHODS: Interactions between TRAIL and TFT were studied in NSCLC cells using growth inhibition and apoptosis assays. Western blotting and flow cytometry were used to investigate underlying mechanisms. RESULTS: The combined treatment of TFT and TRAIL showed synergistic cytotoxicity in A549, H292, H322 and H460 cells. For synergistic activity, the sequence of administration was important; TFT treatment followed by TRAIL exposure did not show sensitization. Combined TFT and TRAIL treatment for 24 h followed by 48 h of TFT alone was synergistic in all cell lines, with combination index values below 0.9. The treatments affected cell cycle progression, with TRAIL inducing a G1 arrest and TFT, a G2/M arrest. TFT activated Chk2 and reduced Cdc25c levels known to cause G2/M arrest. TRAIL-induced caspase-dependent apoptosis was enhanced by TFT, whereas TFT alone mainly induced caspase-independent death. TFT increased the expression of p53 and p21/WAF1, and p53 was involved in the increase of TRAIL-R2 surface expression. TFT also caused downregulation of cFLIP and XIAP and increased Bax expression. CONCLUSIONS: TFT enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis in NSCLC cells by sensitizing the apoptotic machinery at different levels in the TRAIL pathway. Our findings suggest a possible therapeutic benefit of the combined use of TFT and TRAIL in NSCLC.
