Common community-acquired infections include those of the upper respiratory tract. In the 1990s, the antimicrobial treatment of upper respiratory tract infections focused on penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, following the introduction of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, a decrease in invasive pneumococcal disease occurred, and in the case of otitis media a shift towards Haemophilus influenzae as the predominant causative pathogen was observed. Future antimicrobial therapy for outpatient upper respiratory tract infections may need to focus on pathogens such as penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae, beta-lactamase-negative amoxicillin-resistant H. influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. In these circumstances, third-generation oral cephalosporins, such as cefixime and cefdinir, could be increasingly used as an optional first-line therapy in community practice for upper respiratory tract infections suspected to be caused by these key pathogens, as an alternative to amoxicillin-clavulanate.
