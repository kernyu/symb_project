OBJECTIVE: To analyze the susceptibility of influenza A (H3N2) viruses to neuraminidase inhibitors during 2011-2012 in Mainland China. METHODS: All the tested viruses were obtained from the Chinese National Influenza Surveillance Network, which covers 31 provinces in mainland China, including 408 network laboratories and 554 sentinel hospitals. In total 1 903 viruses were selected with isolation date from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2012 in Mainland China, among these viruses, 721 were confirmed to be influenza A (H3N2) virus by Chinese National Influenza Center and tested for the susceptibility to oseltamivir and zanamivir using chemiluminescence-based assay. The neuraminidase inhibitor sensitive reference virus A/Washington/01/2007 (119E) and oseltamivir resistant virus A/Texas/12/2007 (E119V) were used as control in this study. The t -test was used to compare the difference of NAI susceptibility of viruses isolated from different years. RESULTS: The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(5)(0)) of A/Washington/01/2007 for oseltamivir and zanamivir was (0.10 +/- 0.02) and (0.30 +/- 0.05) nmol/L, respectively. The IC(5)(0) of A/Texas/12/2007 for oseltamivir and zanamivir was (4.27 +/- 1.60) and (0.20 +/- 0.03) nmol/L, respectively. Among the 721 influenza A (H3N2) viruses, 132 influenza A (H3N2) viruses were isolated in 2011 and 589 influenza A (H3N2) viruses were isolated in 2012. The IC50 for oseltamivir ranged from 0.04 to 0.62 nmol/L for viruses isolated in 2011 and ranged from 0.02 to 0.95 nmol/L for viruses in 2012, and the IC(5)(0) of all the viruses tested was within 10-fold IC(5)(0) (1.0 nmol/L) of the neuraminidase inhibitor sensitive reference virus A/Washington/01/2007. The IC50 of zanamivir ranged from 0.12 to 0.80 nmol/L for viruses in 2011 and ranged from 0.04 to 0.72 nmol/L for viruses in 2012, and was within 10-fold IC(5)(0) (3.0 nmol/L) of the neuraminidase inhibitor sensitive reference virus A/Washington/01/2007. CONCLUSION: The influenza A(H3N2) viruses isolated during 2011-2012 in Mainland China were tested to be sensitive to oseltamivir and zanamivir.
