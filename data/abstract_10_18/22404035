Adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) is a nucleotide anti-hepatitis B virus drug, which is able to effectively repress the replication of hepatitis B virus (HBV). ADV is a reverse transcriptase inhibitor. However, with the prolonged period of using, many kinds of HBV genetic mutants will occur and therefore resistance to ADV will be created. The purpose of this review is to draw the attention to the molecular mechanism of resistance to ADV.
