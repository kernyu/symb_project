Cross-talk between hormones is required for plant response to developmental cues and environmental stresses. This cross-talk is achieved through several regulators located in convergence point of distinct hormonal signaling. In plant defense responses, salicylic acid and jasmonic acid affect each other in antagonistic manner. In a recent study we showed that AtMYB44 transcription factor positively regulates SA-mediated defense expression and enhanced resistance to Pst DC3000. On the other hand, AtMYB44 negatively regulates expression of JA-mediated defense gene expression and downregulated resistance to Alternaria brassicicola. Effects of AtMYB44 in SA- and JA-mediated defense responses were achieved through direct regulation of WRKY70 expression which acts as an integrator of cross-talk between SA and JA in plant defense responses. Here we provide further evidence that AtMYB44 regulates defense responses by transcriptional activation of downstream gene, WRKY70. This result shows that AtMYB44 is an integrator of cross-talk between SA and JA in plant defense responses.
