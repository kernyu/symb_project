Resistance to conventional synthetic pesticides has been widely reported in Dermanyssus gallinae in poultry production systems. Introducing novel acaricides to poultry industry today is more urgent than ever. Research in this field recently focused on plants and plant-derived compounds as acaricides. In the present study, acaricidal activity of three plant bioactive components, carvacrol, thymol, and farnesol, was assessed against D. gallinae and compared with synthetic pesticide permethrin. Mode of acaricidal action was determined by contact toxicity and fumigant toxicity bioassays. Except farnesol which did not cause any mortality, carvacrol and thymol were found to be toxic to D. gallinae with LD50 values of 1 and 3.15 mug/cm(3), respectively. Permethrin gave the LD50 value of 31.95 mug/cm(3) which was less efficient than carvacrol and thymol. In fumigant toxicity bioassay, mortality rate in carvacrol- and thymol-treated groups in closed method was significantly higher than the open one. On the other hand, permethrin exhibited poor fumigant toxicity as there was no statistically significant difference between mortality rate in open and closed methods. These findings revealed that mechanism of acaricidal activity of carvacrol and thymol but not permethrin was mainly due to fumigant action. Results of the present study suggested that carvacrol and thymol, especially carvacrol, can be developed as a novel potent bioacaricide against D. gallinae.
