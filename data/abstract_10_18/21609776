A severe complication of Plasmodium infection is cerebral malaria, a condition mainly attributed to overwhelming inflammatory immune reactions of the host. Murine models differing in susceptibility to experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) allow detailed studies of the host response. We show that ECM- resistant BALB/c mice were driven into interferon gamma- and IL-12-dependent ECM and subsequent death if they received CpG-oligonucleotides after Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) infection. CpG application triggered production of pro-inflammatory cytokines systemically as well in spleen and brain and induced neuropathological symptoms, leading to increased mortality. Experiments with genetically deficient mice confirmed the role of IFN-gamma and IL-12 during CpG-triggered immunopathology. Furthermore, the application of CpG and downstream production of pro-inflammatory cytokines contributed to the break down of the blood brain barrier visualized by Evan's Blue, comparable to PbA-infected C57BL/6 mice. Taken together, resistance of BALB/c mice towards ECM development could be altered through induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines by CpG. Therefore, approaches discussed earlier to induce pro-inflammatory immune reactions for malaria protection should be considered with caution.
