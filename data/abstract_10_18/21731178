Antimicrobial susceptibilities and toxin types were determined for 275 Clostridium perfringens isolates collected in Ontario in the spring of 2005. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of C. perfringens isolates for 12 antimicrobials used in therapy, prophylaxis, and/or growth promotion of cattle (n = 40), swine (n = 75), turkeys (n = 50), and chickens (n = 100) were determined using the microbroth dilution method. Statistical analyses and MIC distributions showed reduced susceptibility to bacitracin, clindamycin, erythromycin, florfenicol, and tetracycline for some isolates. Reduced susceptibility to bacitracin was identified in chicken (64%) and turkey (60%) isolates. Swine isolates had predominantly reduced susceptibility to clindamycin (28%) and erythromycin (31%), whereas bovine isolates had reduced susceptibility to clindamycin (10%) and florfenicol (10%). Reduced susceptibility to tetracycline was spread across all species. No clear reduced susceptibility, but elevated MIC(50) for virginiamycin was found in chicken isolates in comparison with isolates from other species. Toxin typing revealed that C. perfringens type A is the dominant toxin type isolated in this study across all 4 host species.
