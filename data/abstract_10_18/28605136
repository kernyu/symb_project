A preliminary study is reported for a polycation antimicrobial peptide (AMP) mimic against Propionibacterium acnes, which is associated with acne vulgaris, a common skin condition. Antibiotics are commonly used against P. acnes but buildup of resistance is well-known. Worse, antibiotic regimens build up resistance for more sensitive bacteria such as Staphylococcus epidermidis. The polycation AMP mimic C12-50, 1, is chosen for the present study as it has been previously shown to have high antimicrobial effectiveness. This study reports that C12-50 is active against P. acnes (strain ATCC 6919) with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 6.3 microg mL(-1) . To monitor resistance build-up ten passages are conducted with C12-50 against P. acnes. The MIC remains constant with no resistance buildup. Parallel studies with erythromycin confirm previously reported resistance buildup. The results point to a promising pathway to applications for polycation AMP mimics against P. acnes.
