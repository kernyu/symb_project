Acinetobacter baumanni is known as a worldwide emerging nosocomial infections and it is classified as one of the six dangerous microorganisms by Diseases Society of America. Multi drug-resistant strains of A. baumannii have been reported in recent decades, which may be a result of the high use of antimicrobial agents. Colistin is the last form of treatment against this organism. The presence of pmrA and pmrB genes in A. baumannii causes the resistance of this organism against Colistin. This cross-sectional study was performed on 100 samples of A. baumannii isolated from ulcer, urinary, respiratory, blood of patients admitted to the intensive care unit of Shahid Rajai Shiraz hospital within a 12-month period. The diagnosis was performed by microscopic and biochemical testing using microgen kits. Determining Colistin resistance was carried out by Diffusion Disc, Colistin antibiotic disc of MAST- England and E-test. The analysis of genes pmrA and pmrB genes was done by PCR. 100 A. baumannii samples were diagnosed out of which using diffusion disk 94 cases were sensitive to Colistin and 6 cases were resistant to it. The E-test results in resistant samples presented an MIC equal to 64 micrograms per milliliter. The PCR results in sensitive and resistant to Colistin samples presented the existence of pmrA and pmrB genes. The results indicated the presence of pmrA and pmrB genes that are the main reason of A. baumannii resistance against the last line of treatment of this organism to Colistin.
