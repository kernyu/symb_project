Rapamycin is a polyketide with a 31-membered macrolide ring that possesses powerful immunosuppressant activity. In this study, we firstly obtained a mutant, shikimate-resistant Streptomyces hygroscopicus strain UV-II, which displayed about 3.20-fold higher rapamycin production (305.9 mg/L) than the wild-type S. hygroscopicus ATCC29253 (95.5 mg/L). Under optimal conditions, with the addition of 2 g/L shikimic acid, the strain's rapamycin production was further increased by approximately 34.9%, to 412.6 mg/L. To gain deeper insights into the effects of shikimic acid resistance and supplementation, the fermentation properties, metabolite concentrations, and transcriptional levels of relevant genes were analyzed and evaluated for differences between this improved mutant and its parental strain. The results showed that most of the metabolic modules involved in rapamycin biosynthesis were upregulated in the mutant strain. Analysis of metabolic pathways and gene expression levels further revealed that shikimic acid metabolism plays a crucial role in the synthesis of rapamycin, and identified the rapK gene as a potential target for genetic manipulation to obtain rapamycin-producing strains with improved product yield. Consequently, the rapK gene was overexpressed in the UV-II strain, which to our delight further improved rapamycin production to 457.3 mg/L. These findings thus provide a theoretical basis for further improvements in the production of not only rapamycin, but also of other, analogous macrolide compounds.
