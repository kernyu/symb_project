Protective immunity and host resistance to coccidioidomycosis require a robust cell-mediated immunity with adequate production of Th1 cytokines including interleukin-12, and IFN-gamma and appropriate regulation and coordinated functionality of Th1/Th2 responses and IL-12/IFN-gamma cytokine axes. IFN-gamma augments the anti-fungal activity of effector immune cells against a variety of fungi. Numerous animal models have demonstrated the potential efficacy of adjunctive IFN-gamma in treatment of invasive mycoses. Yet, despite these promising data, a paucity of literature documents efficacious adjunctive IFN-gamma administration in refractory coccidioidomycosis. We present two cases of refractory disease occurring at our institution who responded to adjunctive IFN-gamma.
