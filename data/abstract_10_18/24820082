Of 20 Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Escherichia coli isolates identified at hospitals in western Pennsylvania, 60% belonged to the epidemic ST131-fimH30 subclone. IncFIIk was the most common replicon type for the blaKPC-carrying plasmids (n = 8). All IncFIIk plasmids possessed a scaffold similar to that of pKpQIL, and seven of them were borne by ST131-fimH30 isolates. IncN plasmids conferred resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and IncA/C plasmids conferred resistance to gentamicin. Three blaKPC-carrying plasmids (IncA/C and IncN) possessed blaSHV-7/12 and qnrA1 or qnrS1.
