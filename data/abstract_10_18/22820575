OBJECTIVE: To prepare a nano-TiO(2) film and characterize its antibacterial properties for dental application. METHODS: The TiO(2-x)N(x) antibacterial film was prepared by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering. The crystal structure and surface morphology of the film were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and EDS, and the antibacterial properties of the film against common dental pathogenic bacteria were evaluated. RESULTS: The TiO(2-x)N(x) antibacterial film presented with an anatase phase with a mass ratio of nitrogen of 0.13% and compact and smooth surface. Antibacterial assay of the film showed a resistance rate of 97.79% against Streptococcus mutans, 49.42% against Actinomyces viscosus, and 96.84% against Candida albicans. CONCLUSION: The nano-TiO(2-x)N(x) film shows strong antibacterial effects against common dental pathogenic bacteria and can be used as a novel antibacterial dental material.
