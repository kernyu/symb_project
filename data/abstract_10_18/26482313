We tested the activity of ETX0914 against 187 Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates from men with urethritis in Nanjing, China, in 2013. The MIC50, MIC90, and MIC range for ETX0914 were 0.03 mug/ml, 0.06 mug/ml, and </=0.002 to 0.125 mug/ml, respectively. All isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, and 36.9% (69/187) were resistant to azithromycin. Of the isolates, 46.5% were penicillinase-producing N. gonorrhoeae (PPNG), 36% were tetracycline-resistant N. gonorrhoeae (TRNG), and 13% (24 isolates) had an MIC of 0.125 mug/ml for ceftriaxone. ETX0914 may be an effective treatment option for gonorrhea.
