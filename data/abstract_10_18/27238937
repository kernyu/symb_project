In this study, we investigated colistin resistance mechanisms associated with the regulation of the pbgP operon in Klebsiella pneumoniae, using four isogenic pairs of colistin-susceptible strains and their colistin-resistant derivatives and two colistin-resistant clinical isolates. Amino acid sequence alterations of PhoPQ, PmrAB, and MgrB were investigated, and mRNA expression levels of phoQ, pmrB, pmrD, and pbgP were measured using quantitative real-time PCR. The phoQ and pmrB genes were deleted from two colistin-resistant derivatives, 134R and 063R. We found that phoQ, pmrD, and pbgP were significantly upregulated in all colistin-resistant derivatives. However, pmrB was significantly upregulated in only two colistin-resistant derivatives and one clinical strain. pmrB was not overexpressed in the other strains. The minimum inhibitory concentration of colistin was drastically lower in both phoQ- and pmrB-deleted mutants from a colistin-resistant derivative (134R) that was overexpressing phoQ and pmrB. However, colistin susceptibility was restored only in a phoQ-deleted mutant from a colistin-resistant derivative (063R) without overexpression of pmrB. In conclusion, two different regulations of the pbgP operon may associate with the development of colistin-resisant K. pneumoniae.
