Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease (NTDs), endemic in 88 countries that affect more than 12 million people. Current drugs are limited due to their toxicity, development of biological resistance, length of treatment and high cost. Thus, the search for new effective and less toxic treatments is an urgent need. In this study, we report the synthesis of 3 new amide derivatives of hederagenin (22-24) with yields between 70% and 90%, along with 57 other derivatives of hederagenin (1-21, 25-60) carrying different groups at C-28 previously reported by our group, and the results of their in vitro ability to inhibit the growth of Leishmania infantum. Some derivatives (3, 4, 44, 49 and 52), showed activity at micromolar level and low toxicity against BGM and HepG2 cells. Moreover, the ability of hederagenin derivatives 3 (IC50 = 9.7 muM), 4 (12 muM), 44 (11 muM) and 49 (2 muM), to prevent proliferation of intracellular amastigote forms of L. infantum and their higher selectivity index and low toxicity compared to commercial positive drug control of choice (potassium antimonyl tartrate trihydrate) (IC50 = 80 muM, SI = 0.1), make these compounds promising candidates for the treatment of leishmaniasis.
