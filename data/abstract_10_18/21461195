Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium was isolated from diarrheic piglets in 2 periods, 2000-2001 (n = 25) and 2005-2006 (n = 17). To compare the characteristics of the isolates collected during the 2 periods, all isolates were tested for antimicrobial resistance, the presence of virulence genes, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns. All 42 isolates were resistant to at least 1 of the 20 antimicrobials tested, and 39 (93%) were resistant to 2 or more antimicrobials. One isolate was resistant to 12 antimicrobials. Profiles of antimicrobial resistance revealed 20 resistance types. Several isolates were also resistant to quinolones and expanded-spectrum cephalosporins. Ten isolates (24%) were resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and tetracycline (ACSSuT); only one isolate had been isolated in 2000-2001, indicating that this type of resistance has rapidly disseminated. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays revealed that all the isolates carried invA. Among the 25 strains isolated in 2000-2001, all carried the sipA, sopA, sopD, sopE2, and ssaR genes, and 96% carried sopB and sifA. Among the 17 strains isolated in 2005-2006, all carried sifA, and approximately 90% carried sipA, sopA, sopB, sopD, sopE2, and ssaR. However, only 6 (14%) of the 42 isolates carried spvC. By PFGE analysis, all 42 strains were classified into 4 major clusters, basically by collection period. The genetic similarity according to PFGE suggests that the strains isolated from diarrheic piglets of this region within the same period may be closely related.
