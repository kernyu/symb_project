The literature contains robust evidence on the positive impact of antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASP) in the inpatient setting. With national policies shifting toward provisions of quality health care, the impetus to expand ASP services becomes an important strategy for institutions. However data on stewardship initiatives in other settings are less characterized. For organizations with an established ASP team, it is rational to consider expanding these services to the emergency department (ED). The ED serves as an interface between the inpatient and community settings. It is often the first place where patients present for medical care, including for common infections. Challenges inherent to the fast-paced nature of the environment must be recognized for successful ASP implementation in the ED. Based on the current literature, a combination of strategies for initiating ASP services in the ED will be described. Furthermore, common scenarios and management approaches are proposed for respiratory tract, skin and soft tissue, and urinary tract infections. Expansion of ASP services across the health care continuum may improve patient outcomes with a potential associated decrease in health care costs while preventing adverse effects including the development of antibiotic resistance.
