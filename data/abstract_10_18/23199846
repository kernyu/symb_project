INTRODUCTION: The available microbiological data on community-acquired peritonitis in children are inadequate, and antibiotic therapy is not consensual. Our work aims to study the bacteriology of peritonitis in children in our region and discuss the appropriate antibiotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A descriptive study spread over one year. We collected cases of peritonitis in which a microbiological study of peritoneal fluid was performed. RESULTS: Of 38 cases, the most frequently isolated bacteria is Escherichia coli (E. coli) (50%). Its sensitivity was 64% to amoxicillin-clavulanate, 93.33% to third generation cephalosporins (C3G) and 100% to ertapenem and aminozides. CONCLUSION: We find a high rate of resistance of E. coli to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. This prompts us to reconsider our therapeutic approach. We believe that the association C3G+aminoglycoside+metronidazole should be used first-line in the pediatric peritonitis in our context.
