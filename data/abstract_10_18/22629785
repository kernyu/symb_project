PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Investigation of sensitivity of probiotic microorganisms to antibacterial drugs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Probiotic microorganisms from domestic and foreign commercial preparations were used in experiments. The study of sensitivity of probiotic microorganisms to antibacterial drugs was carried out using solid nutrient medium containing calculated amount of antibacterial drugs. RESULTS: Probiotic microorganisms are mainly sensitive to the representatives of the major classes of antibacterial drugs. Only some of the studied microorganisms are resistant to 1-4 antibiotics. CONCLUSION: When choosing a probiotic in the treatment of dysbacteriosis need to consider whether th antibiotic therapy was carried out. The use of antimicrobial drugs, even in therapeutic doses, reduces the viability of probiotic microorganisms and their survival in the gut.
