Since the discovery of unusual anti-tumor activity of natural polyether antibiotic - Salinomycin, this compound, along with its derivatives, has been intensively studied against different human cancer cells, both in vivo and in vitro. Salinomycin has shown strong inhibition activity against the proliferation process of many different cancer cells, including multi-drug resistance (MDR) cancer cells, as well as cancer stem cells (CSCs), i.e. leukemic stem cells, colon carcinoma stem cells, prostate cancer stem cells and many others. Additionally, the application of Salinomycin has been proved to enhance the anti-cancer effect of radio- and chemotherapy. Preliminary clinical studies have shown tumor regression and only transient acute side effects after application of Salinomycin. Up to now, major efforts have been devoted to elucidate the biological mechanisms of anti-tumor activity of Salinomycin and it is expected that the results may provide new therapeutic strategies based on biological modulation of Salinomycin activity. This review is focused on and describes the possible role of Salinomycin in cancer therapy and gives an overview of its properties.
