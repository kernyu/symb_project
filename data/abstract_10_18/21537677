The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease mutation D30N is exclusively selected by the protease inhibitor (PI) nelfinavir and confers resistance to this drug. We demonstrate that D30N increases the susceptibility to saquinavir (SQV) and amprenavir in HIV-1 subtype B isolates and that the N88D mutation in a D30N background neutralizes this effect. D30N also suppresses indinavir (IDV) resistance caused by the M46I mutation. Interestingly, in patients with viruses originally containing the D30N mutation who were treated with IDV or SQV, the virus either reversed this mutation or acquired N88D, suggesting an antagonistic effect of D30N upon exposure to these PIs. These findings can improve direct salvage drug treatment in resource limited countries where subtype B is epidemiologically important and extend the value of first and second line PIs in these populations.
