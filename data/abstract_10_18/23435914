Based on its chemosensitizing effect, we questioned whether menadione is an inhibitor or a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). To test this hypothesis, we assessed the effect of menadione on P-gp activity and examined the P-gp-dependency of cellular accumulation and cytotoxicity of menadione as well. Treatment with menadione resulted in the concentration-dependent increase of rhodamine 123 (Rh123) accumulation in P-gp-overexpressing MDCKII/MDR1 and NCI/ADR-RES cells, suggesting that menadione inhibits Rh123 extrusion by P-gp. Compared with MDCKII or MCF-7, intracellular distribution of [(3)H]-menadione was significantly lower in MDCKII/MDR1 or NCI/ADR-RES cells, which could be restored by the P-gp inhibitors, verapamil and quinidine. Consistent with these results, MDCKII/MDR1 or NCI/ADR-RES cells were more resistant to the cytotoxicity of menadione than MDCKII or MCF-7 cells, respectively. Such resistance was abolished by the combined treatment of verapamil and quinidine in NCI/ADR-RES cells. Our study identified menadione as a substrate of P-gp, which presumably, acts as the mechanism for the chemosensitizing effect. Menadione may be a promising chemotherapeutic enhancer by its ability of circumventing drug resistance, in addition to its own anti-cancer activity.
