BACKGROUND: Dermatophytosis is the most important superficial fungal infection which affects nearly 20% of human population worldwide. Recurrence of disease and emerging resistance of Trichophyton rubrum to synthetic antifungals are the main problems in control of dermatophytosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) on T. rubrum growth, ergosterol biosynthesis and keratinase activity. METHODS: A CAP system, comprised of helium 98% - oxygen 2% (He/O2), was used. Trichophyton rubrum conidia suspensions were treated with CAP in time periods of 90, 120, 150 and 180 s in 96-well microplates. Fungal growth was evaluated by counting the colony forming unit (CFU). Fungal dry weight, ergosterol biosynthesis and keratinase activity were evaluated in CAP-treated T. rubrum and untreated controls. RESULTS: T. rubrum growth was significantly inhibited by 62%-91%. CAP strongly suppressed fungal ergosterol biosynthesis by 27%-54%. The keratinase activity was increased by 7.30%-21.88% up to 120 s CAP exposure. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated for the first time that CAP inhibits T. rubrum growth, suppresses ergosterol biosynthesis and increases moderately keratinase activity in a dose-dependent manner. Overall, CAP exposure could be a potentially useful method for treatment of clinical cases of human and animal dermatophytoses.
