BACKGROUND: We investigate the presence of the carbapenemase genes in Shewanella xiamenensis strains isolated from River water in Bejaia, Algeria. METHODS: Four isolates of S.xiamenensis were isolated from Soummam River water and identified both by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and sequencing of the 16S rRNA and gyrB genes. Isolates were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Production of carbapenemases was screened using phenotypical tests. PCR and sequencing were used to identify carbapenemase genes produced by these isolates. The genetic context of the blaOXA-48-like gene was investigated by sequencing of the whole genome of strain AS58. RESULTS: The four Shewanella xiamenensis strains harbored blaOXA-48-like genes. It exhibited different resistance patterns and had imipenem MICs>/=0.5mg/L. Sequencing of Shewanella xiamenensis blaOXA-48-like genes, showed that two strains harbored blaOXA-181 gene,blaOXA-199 was identified in one strain and one strain exhibited a new variant of blaOXA-48 gene, namely blaOXA-538. This new variant shared 98% nucleotide identity with blaOXA-162 gene and showed three amino acids changes (G201A, A213G and I21F). Conjugation assays were performed and no transconjugants were obtained. Analysis of AS58 strain genome confirmed the chromosomal location of blaOXA-538 gene. CONCLUSION: This study showed that environmental water hold a diversity of S. xiamenensis strains producing blaOXA-48-like genes and could play an important role in the dissemination and the spread of these genes from the environment to humans.
