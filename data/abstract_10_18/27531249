BACKGROUND: Asteatotic eczema is rarely associated with an underlying malignancy. The condition as paraneoplastic syndrome is characterised by glucocorticoid resistance. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 66-year old woman came to the emergency room with symptoms of dehydration resulting from diarrhoea due to cyclosporine therapy for treatment-resistant eczema. CT scan of thorax and abdomen showed multiple, pathologically enlarged lymph nodes. Histological examination of a lymph node biopsy from the right axilla showed an ALK-negative, anaplastic large T-cell lymphoma. CONCLUSION: Asteatotic eczema is usually innocuous but may also be linked to malignancy. A careful physical examination and early referral to second-line care are needed for rapid diagnosis and treatment of the underlying condition.
