A novel cytotoxin 3,5-bis(4-chlorobenzylidene)-1-[4-{2-(4-morpholinyl)ethoxy}phenyl-carbonyl]-4-pip eridone hydrochloride 2 demonstrated potent antimalarial properties with IC(50) values of 0.60 and 1.97 muM against the drug sensitive D6 strain and the C235 drug-resistant strain of Plasmodium falciparum. This compound concentrates in red blood cells, lowers glutathione concentrations in erythrocytes and permeates across CACO-2 cells. These data reveal 2 to be a promising lead compound in the quest for novel antimalarial agents.
