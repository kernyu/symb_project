Trichosporonosis due to Trichosporon asahii is a life-threatening infection with a very poor prognosis. We analyzed the genotype of intergenic transcribed spacer (IGS) region 1 of the rRNA gene and determined the drug susceptibility of 101 T. asahii isolates obtained from Thai patients to collect basic information on trichosporonosis in Thailand. Of the five genotypes in the IGS region identified in this study, types 1 and 3 were predominant in Thailand. The distribution in Thailand differs from that in other countries, suggesting that there is a geographic substructure among T. asahii clinical isolates. Voriconazole appeared to be the most active drug.
