Studies were performed to determine whether lactic acid treatments used to reduce Escherichia coli O157:H7 on beef trimmings are also effective in controlling non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (nSTEC), and multidrug-resistant and antibiotic-susceptible Salmonella. Beef trimming pieces (10 by 5 by 1 cm) were inoculated (3 log CFU/cm(2)) separately with four-strain mixtures of rifampin-resistant E. coli O157:H7, O26, O45, O103, O111, O121, and O145. Similarly, in a second study, trimmings were separately inoculated with rifampin-resistant E. coli O157:H7, and antibiotic-susceptible or multidrug-resistant (MDR and/or MDR-AmpC) Salmonella Newport and Salmonella Typhimurium. Inoculated trimmings were left untreated (control) or were immersed for 30 s in 5% lactic acid solutions (25 or 55 degrees C). No differences (P >/= 0.05) were obtained among surviving counts of E. coli O157:H7 and those of the tested nSTEC serogroups on lactic acid-treated (25 or 55 degrees C) samples. Counts (3.1 to 3.3 log CFU/cm(2)) of E. coli O157:H7 and nSTEC were reduced (P < 0.05) by 0.5 to 0.9 (25 degrees C lactic acid) and 1.0 to 1.4 (55 degrees C lactic acid) log CFU/cm(2). Surviving counts of Salmonella on treated trimmings were not influenced by serotype or antibiotic resistance phenotype and were similar (P >/= 0.05) or lower (P < 0.05) than surviving counts of E. coli O157:H7. Counts (3.0 to 3.3 log CFU/cm(2)) were reduced (P < 0.05) by 0.5 to 0.8 (E. coli O157:H7) and 1.3 to 1.5 (Salmonella) log CFU/cm(2) after treatment of samples with 25 degrees C lactic acid. Corresponding reductions following treatment with lactic acid at 55 degrees C were 1.2 to 1.5 (E. coli O157:H7) and 1.6 to 1.9 (Salmonella) log CFU/cm(2). Overall, the results indicated that lactic acid treatments used against E. coli O157:H7 on beef trimmings should be similarly or more effective against the six nSTEC serogroups and against multidrug-resistant and antibiotic-susceptible Salmonella Newport and Salmonella Typhimurium.
