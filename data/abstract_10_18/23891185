Several phenyl substituted naphthalenes and isoquinolines have been identified as antibacterial agents that inhibit FtsZ-Zing formation. In the present study we evaluated the antibacterial of several phenyl substituted quinoxalines, quinazolines and 1,5-naphthyridines against methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcusaureus and vancomycin-sensitive and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcusfaecalis. Some of the more active compounds against S. aureus were evaluated for their effect on FtsZ protein polymerization. Further studies were also performed to assess their relative bactericidal and bacteriostatic activities. The notable differences observed between nonquaternized and quaternized quinoxaline derivatives suggest that differing mechanisms of action are associated with their antibacterial properties.
