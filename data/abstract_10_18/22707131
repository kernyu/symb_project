The aim of the present study was to isolate S. aureus strains resistant to antibiotics, characterize the genotype profiles of resistance staphylococci, and evaluate the efficacy of antiseptic agents and disinfectants used in two public hospitals of Vitoria da Conquista, Bahia, Brazil. Clinical samples were obtained from ICU environments and equipment surfaces in two public hospitals in Vitoria da Conquista. Broth cultures were plated onto mannitol salt agar, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the broth microdilution method according to CLSI. MRSA strains were submitted to PCR for detecting the mecA gene. PCR products were purified and sequenced for SCCmec type identification. Moreover, the strains were tested for efficacy of different disinfectant solutions. S. aureus were isolated from 31 and 67 sites in each hospital, respectively. Among the isolates from hospital 1, 07 (22.6%) were resistant to oxacillin while 28 (41.8%) were resistant in hospital 2. Thirty-one were positive for the mecA gene. All isolates showed SCCmec type III genotype characteristics of the Brazilian epidemic clone. In disinfectant tests, sodium hypochlorite (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0%), 2% chlorhexidine gluconate, quaternary ammonium, peracetic acid and formaldehyde were effective against the isolates tested. The strains showed higher resistance to vinegar (4% acetic acid), alcohol and glutaraldehyde. The findings of this study should assist in reducing the occurrence of nosocomial infections and therefore the morbidity, mortality and socio-economic burden caused by prolonged hospitalization.
