The prevalence of class D extended-spectrum oxacillinases (ES-OXAs) in ceftazidime-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is often underestimated by double-disk synergy tests (DDST) using clavulanate. A DDST with a customized distance between a disk of ceftazidime or cefepime and inhibitors (clavulanate and imipenem) detected 14 out of 15 different ES-OXAs.
