BACKGROUND: Hospitalization for fever in cancer patients is associated with considerable morbidity, mortality, and cost. AIM: The aim of this study was to study the bacterial spectrum and susceptibility patterns of pathogens in culture positive patients from the oncology unit of our hospital. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients admitted in our cancer center (medical, radiation, and surgical oncology) from January to December 2013. Blood and respiratory secretions from the indoor patients were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the total 693 samples, 76.4% were Gram-negative and 23.6% were Gram-positive. The most common bacterial isolates among Gram-negative organisms in blood were Escherichia coli, Salmonella and among the Gram-positive organism were Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus. Among the blood isolates extended spectrum of beta-lactamase, multidrug-resistant (carbapenem-resistant) and pan resistant bugs were seen in 47%, 15%, and 5% of the blood isolates. Among the Gram-positive organisms, 25% respiratory isolates were vancomycin-resistant Enterococci. CONCLUSION: We observed a high incidence of Gram-negative isolates with clinically significant resistance to first-line antibiotics such as cephalosporin's, piperacillin tazobactum, and fluoroquinolones.
