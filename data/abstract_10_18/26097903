An estimated 184 million people worldwide have hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Chronic infection can ultimately result in liver cirrhosis and hepatic failure. Eradication of the virus by antiviral treatment can hinder the development of the aforementioned complications. Historically, the combination therapy of PEGylated interferon/ribavirin was considered the standard-of-care therapy for HCV. Such therapy did not demonstrate satisfactory cure rates and had significant side effects that precluded its widespread use among HCV patients. In view of this situation, scientific advances have led to the development of new interferon-free regimens that are better tolerated, more effective and with shorter duration of therapy. One of the newest members of this family is the all-oral regimen (ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir co-packaged with dasabuvir) that has recently received FDA approval for the treatment of adult patients with genotype 1 HCV infection, including those with compensated cirrhosis. This new combination was found to be safe and well tolerated with high rates of sustained virologic response of up to 100%. An overview of the current knowledge about this regimen is reviewed herein.
