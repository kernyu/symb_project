Using serial intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), integrated-backscatter IVUS, and optical coherence tomography, we observed rapidly progressive cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) and donor-transmitted plaque in the left anterior descending artery. Late-phase everolimus-resistant CAV had a rapidly progressive course (maximal intimal thickness [MIT] increased by 0.5 mm between years 3 and 4 after cardiac transplantation, from MIT growth<0.5 mm at year 1). Conversely, the donor-transmitted plaque grew slowly (0.1 mm increase during the same period). Tissue characteristics in the 2 segments were also different; CAV had eccentric, noncalcified, and lipid-rich components and was associated with macrophage accumulation, whereas donor-transmitted atherosclerosis presented with typical features of atherosclerosis (ie, fibrocalcific plaque). CAV with late-phase progression involves everolimus resistance and features of vulnerable plaques seen in nontransplantation patients and is independent of donor-transmitted atherosclerosis.
