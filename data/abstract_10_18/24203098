The emergence of mutations that confer drug resistance in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is increasing in China. We aimed to compare the cumulative efficacy and resistance of adefovir (ADV) monotherapy and ADV add-on lamivudine (LAM) (ADV+LAM) therapy in LAM-resistant patients. One-hundred adult CHB patients with LAM-resistance mutations were identified. Of these 100, 52 patients were treated with ADV monotherapy and 48 were treated with ADV+LAM combination therapy for at least 24 months. After 2-year treatment, the cumulative rates of serum alanine aminotransferase normalization were, respectively, 73.1 and 83.3 % in the ADV monotherapy and ADV+LAM therapy groups (P = 0.216). Additionally, 36 patients receiving ADV plus LAM had hepatitis B e antigen loss/seroconversion, as compared with 30 in patients (P = 0.068). More patients who received LAM plus ADV than those who received ADV alone had HBV DNA levels below 1,000 international unit/milliliters (83.3 vs. 50 %, P < 0.001). Viral breakthrough and genotypic mutations were detected in 19 (36.5 %) and 9 (18.8 %) patients in the ADV monotherapy and ADV+LAM therapy groups, respectively (P = 0.048). ADV+LAM combination therapy demonstrated faster and significantly greater suppression of HBV DNA compared with ADV therapy alone for patients with LAM-resistance mutations. ADV+LAM was superior to ADV monotherapy in achieving the initial viral breakthrough and genotypic mutations. ADV+LAM combination therapy was rational for most of LAM-resistant Chinese patients with chronic hepatitis B.
