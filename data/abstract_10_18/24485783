Since the 1960s, fungal infections have become a major worldwide public health problem. Antifungal treatments have many limitations, such as toxicity and resistance. Matayba guianensis Aublet (Sapindaceae) was chemically investigated as part of our ongoing search for lead molecules against fungi in the Brazilian Cerrado biome. The ethanolic extract of M. guianensis root bark revealed the presence of two previously unreported ether diglycosides: matayoside E (1) and F (2) with anti Candida activity, along with two known compounds: cupanioside (3) and stigmasterol (4).
