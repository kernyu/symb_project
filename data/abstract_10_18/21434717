Without any treatment, the prognosis of hepatitis B in liver transplant recipients is very poor. So, antiviral prophylaxis is very important in patients with hepatitis B who undergo liver transplantation. Before liver transplantation, a suppression of viral replication has to be achieved by nucleos(t)ide analogs. Drugs used in the prophylaxis of post-transplant hepatitis B include immunoglobulin against HBV and nucleos(t)ide analogs. Prophylaxis against graft infection must be based on the individual risk of recurrence. When prophylactic measures have failed and graft infection has occurred, treatment of recurrent hepatitis B may be based on the resistance profile of the virus and previous antiviral exposure. Finally, lamivudine seems to be very effective in the prevention of de novo hepatitis B in patients transplanted with a graft from an anti-HBc positive donor.
