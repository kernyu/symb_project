Antimicrobial resistance has been one of the biggest global current issues in medicine and public health. Overuse and imprudent use of antimicrobial agents are recognized as one of the leading causes of antibiotic resistance. The aim of this study was to analyze the attitudes of Polish physicians practicing at the community level towards antibiotics and antimicrobial resistance. The majority of physicians taking part in the survey believed that Polish people overuse antibiotics (98%). Most physicians (91%) considered that antimicrobial resistance is a major problem at present. The majority of physicians indicated the reasons for prescribing the antibiotic are related to health factors, such as optimal recovery (best effectiveness, least side effects) (80%), latest therapeutic guidelines (70%) and microbiological/epidemiological factors (63%). Knowledge of the National Recommendations for the management of Community-Acquired Respiratory Tract Infections 2010 (NR-CA-RTI) developed within National Programme for Protection of Antibiotics was declared by 84% of respondents. Among those who are aware of the NR-CA-RTI, the majority follow them in their daily practice (91%). Among physicians, 62% are not familiar with the Centor/McIsaac scores used to differentiate bacterial and viral infections in patients presenting with a sore throat. Among physicians familiar with the scores, 90% use them in their daily practice. Rapid microbiological detection methods for Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis are used only by 20% of respondents. Almost all of physicians declared readiness to use these tests. Main sources of information on antibiotics prescribing originate from Polish medical journals, scientific conferences organized by medical societies, pharmaceutical companies.
