Macrolide antibiotics are widely prescribed for the treatment of respiratory tract infections; however, the increasing prevalence of macrolide-resistant pathogens is a public health concern. Therefore, the development of new macrolide derivatives with activities against resistant pathogens is urgently needed. A series of novel 6-O-(heteroaryl-isoxazolyl)propynyl 2-fluoro ketolides has been synthesized from erythromycin A. These compounds have shown very promising in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities against key respiratory pathogens including erythromycin-susceptible/resistant strains.
