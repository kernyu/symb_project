Patients with self-limiting respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are frequently seen in general practice. Although antibiotics are ineffective for these conditions, they are often prescribed by general practitioners (GPs), and perceived patient expectations for an antibiotic plays an important role in the decision to prescribe one. Superfluous use of antibiotics contributes to antimicrobial resistance. High numbers of nurse prescribers work alongside GPs and these prescribers see education and self-management advice as central to the care of these patients. Multi-faceted interventions, designed to reduce antibiotic prescribing, only exist for GPs. Such interventions should foster interprofessional collaboration and, as such, consider the needs and experiences of the different prescribers, and the views of patients. This paper outlines a research study in which a questionnaire will be distributed to patients who consult with a nurse prescriber to see whether their expectations influence their satisfaction with the consultation outcome. Findings will guide the development of an interprofessional intervention designed to promote collaborative practice and appropriate and responsible antibiotic prescribing in primary care.
