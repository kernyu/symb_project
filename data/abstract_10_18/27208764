Multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria are one of the most important threats to public health. Typically, MDR bacteria are associated with nosocomial infections. However, some MDR bacteria have become prevalent causes of community-acquired infections. The spread of MDR bacteria into the community is a crucial development, and is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, health care costs, and antibiotic use. Factors associated with community dissemination of MDR bacteria overlap but are distinct from those associated with nosocomial spread. Prevention of further community spread of MDR bacteria is of the utmost importance, and requires a multidisciplinary approach involving all stakeholders.
