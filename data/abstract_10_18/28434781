Based upon molecular insights from the X-ray structures of inhibitor-bound HIV-1 protease complexes, we have designed a series of isophthalamide-derived inhibitors incorporating substituted pyrrolidines, piperidines and thiazolidines as P2-P3 ligands for specific interactions in the S2-S3 extended site. Compound 4b has shown an enzyme Ki of 0.025nM and antiviral IC50 of 69nM. An X-ray crystal structure of inhibitor 4b-HIV-1 protease complex was determined at 1.33A resolution. We have also determined X-ray structure of 3b-bound HIV-1 protease at 1.27A resolution. These structures revealed important molecular insight into the inhibitor-HIV-1 protease interactions in the active site.
