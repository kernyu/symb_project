BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The authors investigate clinical settings, antibiotic susceptibility and resistance patterns, and visual outcomes associated with endophthalmitis caused by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Records of six patients with S. maltophilia endophthalmitis between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2007, were reviewed. RESULTS: Clinical settings included post-trauma (2 eyes), post-cataract extraction (2 eyes), post-keratoplasty with keratitis (1 eye), and post-vitreous lavage (1 eye). Presenting visual acuity ranged from counting fingers to no light perception. Final visual acuity ranged from 10/20 to no light perception. Initial treatment included pars plana vitrectomy in 4 eyes and tap in 2 eyes. Most isolates were susceptible to fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or moxifloxacin) and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim; however, they were resistant to ceftazidime and aminoglycosides. CONCLUSION: S. maltophilia is an uncommon causative agent of endophthalmitis and is resistant to commonly used antibiotics, such as ceftazidime and aminoglycosides. Based on in vitro antibiotic susceptibility testing, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and new-generation fluoroquinolones may be preferable in the treatment of endophthalmitis caused by S. maltophilia.
