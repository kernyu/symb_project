Fosfomycin trometamol is a broad spectrum antibiotic recently marketed in the UK for the treatment of acute uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections (UTIs) in adults(1,2) and in adult and adolescent females.(3) It is also indicated for prophylaxis in diagnostic and surgical transurethral procedures.(1-3) Fosfomycin was discovered in 1969 and the reference drug was first marketed as Monuril in France in 1986.(3,4) Although Monuril had UK marketing authorisation, it was never distributed in the UK. However, national guidance included the option of using unlicensed imported fosfomycin.(3,5,6) Branded and generic versions of fosfomycin are now available in the UK,(1-3,7) and here we review the evidence for their use in the treatment of UTIs.
