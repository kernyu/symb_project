Detection of virulent strains associated with aquatic environment is a current concern for the management and control of human and animal health. Thus, Vibrio diversity was investigated in four estuaries from state of Ceara (Pacoti, Choro, Pirangi and Jaguaribe) followed by antimicrobial susceptibility to different antimicrobials used in aquaculture and detection of main virulence factors to human health. Isolation and identification were performed on TCBS agar (selective medium) and dichotomous key based on biochemical characteristics, respectively. Nineteen strains of genus Vibrio were catalogued. Vibrio parahaemolyticus (Choro River) and V. alginolyticus (Pacoti River) were the most abundant species in the four estuaries. All strains were submitted to disk diffusion technique (15 antimicrobials were tested). Resistance was found to: penicillin (82%), ampicillin (54%), cephalotin (7%), aztreonan (1%), gentamicin, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone (0.5%). Five pathogenic strains were chosen to verification of virulence factors. Four estuaries showed a high abundance of species. High number of tested positive strains for virulence is concerning, since some of those strains are associated to human diseases, while others are known pathogens of aquatic organisms.
