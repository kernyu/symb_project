Treatments for Clostridium difficile infection remain limited, despite the introduction of fidaxomicin, and development of new agents is necessary. We determined the in vitro susceptibilities of 199 prevalent or emerging Clostridium difficile PCR ribotypes to MCB3681, a novel investigational quinolonyl-oxazolidinone, and 8 comparators (metronidazole, vancomycin, fidaxomicin, moxifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, tigecycline, and linezolid). MCB3681 showed good activity against C. difficile with no evidence of MCB3681 resistance in isolates showing either moxifloxacin or linezolid resistance or both moxifloxacin and linezolid resistance.
