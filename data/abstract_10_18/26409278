Biomarkers play an essential role in accelerating drug development. Sputum culture conversion using solid medium is the best-characterized tuberculosis biomarker, having been examined at the patient and trial levels in studies with thousands of subjects, and having recently been validated using data from 3 unsuccessful phase 3 trials. We presently are poised at the threshold of regulatory innovation for antibacterials to treat drug-resistant infections, in which Special Medical Use authorization restricted to patients with limited options could be based on the results of small clinical trials. Patients worldwide would be well served by licensing of new regimens for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis based on biomarker evidence commensurate with the urgency of the current global crisis.
