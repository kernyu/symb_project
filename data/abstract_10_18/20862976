Prevalence of fungal infection increased rapidly in recent years. The organisms developed resistance to conventional antifungal agents such as azoles and polyenes, while the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) showed certain advantages in the fight against fungal infections. This paper reviewed the latest research progress of TCM against common pathogenic fungi such as Candida albicans, Dermatophytes, Aspergillus, Malassezia, Fusarium oxysporum fungus, Sporothrix schenckii, Cryptococcus neoformnans, and fungal biofilm.
