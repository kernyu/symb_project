INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have shown a close relationship between Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), insulin resistance, and altered metabolic parameters. However, the effects of H. pylori eradication on these conditions remain controversial. We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of H. pylori eradication on insulin resistance and metabolic parameters. METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases from their inception to July 2016. Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), body weight (BW), BMI, waist circumference, triglycerides (TG), high-density and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C and LDL-C), and fasting blood glucose (FBG) were compared between patients with and without H. pylori eradication using a random-effects model. We reported pooled mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the change in outcomes. RESULTS: Data from five studies showed no difference in HOMA-IR after H. pylori eradication (pooled MD=-0.52, 95% CI: -1.47 to 0.42). Eradication significantly increased BMI (MD=0.36, 95% CI: 0.11-0.60) and BW (MD=1.1, 95% CI: 0.8-1.5), but had no significant effects on TG, LDL-C, HDL-C, or FBG. CONCLUSION: H. pylori eradication does not improve insulin resistance, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, or FBG, but may increase BW and BMI. Further studies are needed to clarify the effect of H. pylori eradication on metabolism.
