OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to determine the interplay between the plasmid-mediated qepA2 gene and multiple chromosomally mediated fluoroquinolone resistance determinants in the development of fluoroquinolone resistance in Escherichia coli and its influence on bacterial fitness. METHODS: E. coli ATCC 25922 and derived isogenic strains harbouring different chromosomally mediated fluoroquinolone resistance determinants were electroporated with pBK-CMV vector encoding QepA2. The MICs of fluoroquinolones were determined by standardized microdilution. The mutant prevention concentration (MPC) was evaluated. Bacterial fitness was analysed using DeltalacZ system competition assays. RESULTS: The ciprofloxacin MIC for strains harbouring the qepA2 gene was 4- to 8-fold higher compared with strains without the qepA2 gene. The qepA2 gene also increased the MPC of ciprofloxacin 4- to 16-fold. Combination of the qepA2 gene plus two to three additional mechanisms conferred a clinically relevant resistance level. The presence of the qepA2 gene was associated with fitness costs in strains with mutations in the gyrA and/or parC genes, although the presence of an additional deletion of the marR gene compensated for this fitness cost by increasing bacterial fitness by 5%-23%. CONCLUSIONS: The additive effect of chromosomally mediated fluoroquinolone resistance mechanisms and the qepA2 gene led to clinical levels of fluoroquinolone resistance. Under competitive conditions, the qepA2 gene had a biological cost in E. coli that was compensated for by the presence of an additional deletion in the marR gene.
