KEY MESSAGE: DgNAC1, a transcription factor of chrysanthemum, was functionally verified to confer salt stress responses by regulating stress-responsive genes. NAC transcription factors play effective roles in resistance to different abiotic stresses, and overexpressions of NAC TFs in Arabidopsis have been proved to be conducive in improving salinity tolerance. However, functions of NAC genes in chrysanthemum continue to be poorly understood. Here, we performed physiology and molecular experiments to evaluate roles of DgNAC1 in chrysanthemum salt stress responses. In this study, DgNAC1-overexpressed chrysanthemum was obviously more resistant to salt over the WT (wild type). Specifically, the transgenic chrysanthemum showed a higher survival rate and lower EC (electrolyte conductivity) than WT under salt stress. The transgenic chrysanthemum also showed fewer accumulations of MDA (malondialdehyde) and reactive oxygen species (H2O2 and O2(-)), greater activities of SOD (superoxide dismutase), POD (peroxidase) and CAT (catalase), as well as more proline content than WT under salt stress. Furthermore, stress-responsive genes in transgenic chrysanthemum were greater up-regulated than in WT under salinity stress. Thus, all results revealed that DgNAC1 worked as a positive regulator in responses to salt stress and it may be an essential gene for molecular breeding of salt-tolerant plants.
