Understanding the pathogenesis and refine the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia have been tremendously improved in the past decade. Treatment outcome and estimated prognosis have become more accurate due to the advanced molecular biological techniques and the classical prognostic markers. Incorporation of fludarabine and rituximab into the standard protocols fundamentally improved treatment outcome in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Chemoimmunotherapy has improved not only the remission rates but had a significant impact on overall survival, as well. Eliminating residual leukemia and achieving complete hematological remissions at such high rates establish potential background for cure. Still, a great deal of dispute has been emerged regarding everyday clinical practice. Authors present their institutional experiences and review the literature.
