AIMS: We sought to characterize the antibiotic susceptibility of strains of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolated from clinical samples, and the role of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia biofilm in antibiotic resistance. METHODS: Fifty-one clinical Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates were obtained from patients with nosocomial infection in the surgical wards and ICUs of six general hospitals in Tianjin, China. In vitro models of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia biofilms were established and confirmed by scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy with silver staining. The minimal inhibitory concentrations and biofilm inhibitory concentrations of commonly used antibiotics were determined. RESULTS: 47 of 51 strains were resistant to three or more antibiotics. 42 of 51 strains formed Stenotrophomonas maltophilia biofilms in vitro. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia biofilm formation greatly reduced sensitivity to most tested antibiotics, but not to levofloxacin. However, in the presence of erythromycin scanning electron microscopy revealed that levofloxacin inhibited Stenotrophomonas maltophilia biofilm formation. Factorial ANOVA revealed that erythromycin enhanced susceptibility to levofloxacin, cefoperazone/sulbactam, and piperacillin (p<0.05), and an DeltaE model revealed that levofloxacin and erythromycin acted synergistically in biofilms, suggesting specific use of combined macrolide therapy may represent an effective treatment for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infection. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotics could act synergistically to combat the protection conferred to clinical isolates of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia by biofilms. Macrolide antibiotics may be effective where used in combination.
