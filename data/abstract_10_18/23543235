beta-Lactamase production is the common mechanism of resistance of beta-lactam antibiotics. Knowledge of inter-residue interactions in protein structures increases our understanding of protein structure and stability. We have systematically analysed the contribution of C-H...pi interactions to the stability of beta-lactamases. Most of the interactions are long range and most of the interacting residues are evolutionarily conserved. The occurrence of C-H...pi interactions in active sites and metal binding sites is very low in beta-lactamases. Hence, C-H...pi interactions are important determinants of stability in beta-lactamases and they may not play a significant role in specificity. The results from this study provide valuable insights for understanding the stability patterns of beta-lactamases and their relation to various other environmental preferences.
