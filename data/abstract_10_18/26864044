The aim of the present work was to study the epidemiology of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis) in Greece, comparing all the food and food animal isolates during a 3-year period with clinical isolates. Submission of the generated data to the PulseNet Europe database was carried out in order to study the population structure of this particular serovar and indicate possible connections with European strains. One hundred and sixty-eight (168) S. Enteritidis strains of human, animal, and food origin, isolated during the period 2008-2010 in Greece, were studied. Strains were characterized by phenotypic (antibiotic resistance) and molecular [pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST)] methods. PFGE revealed 39 XbaI, 48 BlnI, and 80 XbaI-BlnI distinct pulsotypes, suggesting several clones circulating through the food chain and multiple sources of transmission. Submission to the PulseNet Europe database indicated that PFGE profile SENTXB.0001, the most common PFGE profile in Europe, was also predominant in Greece (33.3 %). MLST showed that all the strains studied shared the same sequence type (ST11), representing the most common ST in Europe. High rates of resistance to nalidixic acid were observed among human and poultry isolates (~25 %), indicating the potential fluoroquinolone treatment failure. Our data suggest that strains originating from multiple reservoirs circulated in Greece through the food chain during the study period. Predominant profiles in Greece were common to PulseNet Europe profiles, indicating similarities between the S. Enteritidis populations in Greece and Europe.
