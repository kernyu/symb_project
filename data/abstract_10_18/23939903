Drug resistance has become a global threat that, if not addressed, may return us to the preantibiotic era. A way to overcome the problem of growing incidence of global antibiotic resistance is to introduce compounds belonging to classes that are new to the clinic. During a screening of the marine microbial extract library for new antibiotics, one of the extracts showed promising antibacterial activity against Gram-positive organisms. Bioactivity-guided isolation and characterization of active metabolites led to the discovery of a novel thiazolyl cyclic-peptide antibiotic, PM181104. It was isolated and characterized from a marine sponge-associated actinobacterium strain of the genus Kocuria (MTCC 5269). The compound exhibited a potent in vitro antibacterial activity against a broad range of Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). The MIC values evaluated for the compound were found to be in the single-digit nanomolar range. In in vivo studies of PM181104 in a BALB/c murine septicemia model, the compound displayed 100% effective dose (ED100) values of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg of body weight against MRSA and 10.0 mg/kg against VRE. In this report, in vitro and in vivo studies of PM181104 are described.
