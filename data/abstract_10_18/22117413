Antimutagenic activity on human RD cells was studied for beta-purothionin Tk-AMP-BP isolated from seeds of wheat Triticum kiharae, which has a higher stress resistance. Cadmium chloride at 5 x 10(-6) M was used as a mutagen. The numbers of DNA breaks in mutagen-treated and intact cells were inferred from the single-stranded to double-stranded DNA ratio and expressed as protection coefficients. The protective effect was simultaneously assayed for aqueous plant extracts known to possess antioxidant properties. Wheat thionin was the most active among all of the antimutagens examined; its protection coefficient reached 85-88% at micromolar peptide concentrations (8-32 microg/ml). Thus, wheat beta-purothionin was for the first time demonstrated to be highly efficient in protecting human cell DNA from the damaging effect of cadmium chloride.
