The aims of this network group were to collect epidemiological data of PcP cases in 14 hospitals in the Paris area and to determine the Di-Hydro Pteroate Synthase (DHPS) genotypes, genetic markers for possible sulfamide resistance. From January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2008, 993 (mean 166/year) PcP cases have been reported. Sixty-five percent of patients were HIV-positive. The median count of CD4 lymphocytes was 32/mm(3) (30 in HIV-positive patients, 152 in HIV-negative patients). In HIV-positive patients, PcP revealed the HIV infection in 39%. Among 304 PcP occurring in HIV known infected patients, no prophylaxis was prescribed for 64%; cotrimoxazole prophylaxis had been prescribed to 47 patients but only one of them had the right compliance. In HIV-negative patients (264), corticosteroids were prescribed in 59% and cytotoxic chemotherapies in 34%; 78% did not receive prophylaxis. One hundred sixty nine tumoral pathologies and 116 transplantations were notified. The mortality rate was 16% at day 14 (13% in HIV-positive patients, 26% in HIV-negative patients). Mutations in DHPS genes were detected in 18.5% of samples; 12.5% of patients were infected with several strains. The total annual number of cases has been stable for five years but the proportion of HIV-negative patients increased from 25% to 43%.
