Malaria is one of the most devastating infectious diseases in the developing world. Until now, only one candidate malaria vaccine RTS,S/AS01 has shown modest protection in phase 3 trial in African infants. Hence the treatment of malaria still depends on the current chemotherapeutic drugs. Considering the resistance of malaria parasites to almost all used antimalarial drugs, aiming at multi-targets rather than a single target will be a more promising strategy. Previous studies have shown that myricetin and fisetin exhibited in vitro antimalarial activity against Plasmodium falciparum, but very little research focused on the molecular mechanism for their parasiticidal activity. The cysteine protease falcipain-2 and aspartic protease plasmepsin II have long been considered as important antimalarial drug targets, especially combined inhibition of these two proteases. In this study, we determined that myricetin and fisetin are dual inhibitors of falcipain-2 and plasmepsin II, which might account for their antimalarial properties. Overall, the dual inhibition of falcipain-2 and plasmepsin II by myricetin and fisetin has shed light on a possible mechanism for their antimalarial activity and provided a rationale for further development as antimalarial drugs.
