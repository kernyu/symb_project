Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has been recently introduced to many diagnostic microbiological laboratories. Besides the identification of bacteria and fungi, that technique provides a potentially useful tool for the detection of antimicrobial resistance, especially of that conferred by beta-lactamases. Here, we describe an assay allowing a detection of meropenem hydrolysis in clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas spp., and Acinetobacter baumannii using MALDI-TOF MS. This method is able to confirm carbapenemases within 3 h. The results are important for proper and fast intervention to limit the spread of carbapenemase-producing bacteria and provide information for appropriate initial therapy of the infections caused by these microbes.
