In search for seed coat-specific promoters for canola (Brassica napus), transgenic plants carrying a 2,121 bp fragment of Arabidopsis thaliana At4g12960 promoter (AtGILTpro) fused to the uidA reporter gene (GUS) were generated. Out of 7 independent events in transgenic canola plants raised, 2 exhibited GUS activity exclusively in the outer integument of the seed coat. GUS activity in other tissues was also observed in the remaining five transformants. Therefore, the AtGILT promoter can be used as a canola seed coat outer integument-specific promoter after the generation and selection of desired transformants from several transgenic lines.
