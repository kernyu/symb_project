In aquaculture, the occurrence of enteritis has increased and dietary nutrition is considered as one of the major strategies to solve this problem. In the present study, we assume that dietary phosphorus might enhance intestinal immune barrier and physical barrier function to reduce the occurrence of enteritis in fish. To test this assumption, a total of 540 grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) were investigated by feeding graded levels of available phosphorus (0.95-8.75g/kg diet) and then infection with Aeromonas hydrophila. The results firstly showed that phosphorus deficiency decreased the ability to combat enteritis, which might be related to the impairment of intestinal immune barrier and physical barrier function. Compared with optimal phosphorus level, phosphorus deficiency decreased fish intestinal antimicrobial substances activities or contents and down-regulated antimicrobial peptides mRNA levels leading to the impairment of intestinal immune response. Phosphorus deficiency down-regulated fish intestinal anti-inflammatory cytokines mRNA levels and up-regulated the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines [except IL-1beta and IL-12p35 in distal intestine (DI) and IL-12p40] causing aggravated of intestinal inflammatory responses, which might be related to the signalling molecules target of rapamycin and nuclear factor kappa B. In addition, phosphorus deficiency disturbed fish intestinal tight junction function and induced cell apoptosis as well as oxidative damage leading to impaired of fish intestinal physical barrier function, which might be partially associated with the signalling molecules myosin light chain kinase, c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase and NF-E2-related factor 2, respectively. Finally, based on the ability to combat enteritis, dietary available phosphorus requirement for grass carp (254.56-898.23g) was estimated to be 4.68g/kg diet.
