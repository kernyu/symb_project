BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to observe the plasmid mediated intraspecies and interspecies transfer of vancomycin resistance, and possible antibacterial activity of nanoconjugated vancomycin against such resistant. METHODS: Plasmids were isolated from a chosen vancomycin resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain (MMC-17). The obtained 890 bp plasmid was then transferred to vancomycin sensitive S. aureus (MMC-6) and Escherichia coli (RGK 26) strains. RESULTS: The vancomycin sensitive S. aureus and E. coli developed vancomycin resistance. Plasmid analysis of the transformed MMC-6 and RGK 26 revealed that it contains 890 bp plasmid corresponding to the donor S. aureus, which may harbor the vanA gene. Nanoconjugated vancomycin shows its efficient drug action through transport of vancomycin into transformed MMC-6 and RGK 26. CONCLUSIONS: Plasmid mediated intraspecies and interspecies transfer of vancomycin resistance is accomplished by the vanA gene. Nanoconjugated vancomycin shows effective drug delivery in plasmid mediated vancomycin resistance in S. aureus and E. coli.
