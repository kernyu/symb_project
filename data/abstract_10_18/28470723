The main objectives of this study were (i) to evaluate the serum pharmacokinetic behaviour and milk penetration of marbofloxacin (MFX; 5 mg/kg), after intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) administration in lactating goats and simulate a multidose regimen on steady-state conditions, (ii) to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and mutant prevention concentration (MPC) of coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) isolated from caprine mastitis in Cordoba, Argentina and (iii) to make a PK/PD analysis by Monte Carlo simulation from steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of MFX by IV and IM routes to evaluate the efficacy and risk of the emergence of resistance. The study was carried out with six healthy, female, adult Anglo Nubian lactating goats. Marbofloxacin was administered at 5 mg/kg bw by IV and IM route. Serum and milk concentrations of MFX were determined with HPLC/uv. From 106 regional strains of CNS isolated from caprine mastitis in herds from Cordoba, Argentina, MICs and MPCs were determined. MIC90 and MPC90 were 0.4 and 6.4 mug/ml, respectively. MIC and MPC-based PK/PD analysis by Monte Carlo simulation indicates that IV and IM administration of MFX in lactating goats may not be adequate to recommend it as an empirical therapy against CNS, because the most exigent endpoints were not reached. Moreover, this dose regimen could increase the probability of selecting mutants and resulting in emergence of resistance. Based on the results of Monte Carlo simulation, the optimal dose of MFX to achieve an adequate antimicrobial efficacy should be 10 mg/kg, but it is important take into account that fluoroquinolones are substrates of efflux pumps, and this fact may determine that assumption of linear pharmacokinetics at high doses of MFX may be incorrect.
