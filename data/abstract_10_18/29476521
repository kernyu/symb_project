Several peptides that were first identified on the basis of their antimicrobial or immunomodulatory properties have subsequently shown potential for development into agents for the treatment of patients with Type 2 diabetes. A strategy is presented for the isolation and characterization of such peptides in norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions from a range of frog species. The methodology involves fractionation of the secretions by reversed-phase HPLC, identification of fractions containing components that stimulate the rate of release of insulin from BRIN-BD11 clonal beta-cells without simultaneously stimulating the release of lactate dehydrogenase, identification of active peptides in the mass range 1-6 kDa by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, purification of the peptides to near homogeneity by further HPLC, and structural characterization by automated Edman degradation. The effect of synthetic replicates of the active peptides on glucose homeostasis in vivo may be evaluated in mice fed a high fat diet to produce obesity, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance.
