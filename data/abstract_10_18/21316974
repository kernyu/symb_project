A series of 15-membered azalide urea and thiourea derivatives has been synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro antimalarial activity against chloroquine-sensitive (D6), chloroquine/pyremethamine resistant (W2) and multidrug resistant (TM91C235) strains of Plasmodium falciparum. We have developed an effective automated synthetic strategy for the rapid synthesis of urea/thiourea libraries of a macrolide scaffold. Compounds have been synthesized using a solution phase strategy with overall yields of 50-80%. Most of the synthesized compounds had inhibitory effects. The top 10 compounds were 30-65 times more potent than azithromycin, an azalide with antimalarial activity, against all three strains.
