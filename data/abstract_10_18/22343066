OBJECTIVES: To determine prevalence, incidence and risk factors of colonization by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriacae (ESBLE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) in aged subjects admitted to an acute geriatric unit at a teaching hospital. METHODS: During 12 months, 337 patients were screened by nasal, oropharyngeal, groin, axillary and rectal swabs upon admission and at discharge. RESULTS: The prevalence of ESBLE, MRSA and VRE carriage upon admission was 11.6%, 7.5% and 0.6%, respectively. The incidence density of ESBLE and MRSA carriage was respectively of 1.77 and 2.40 new cases for 1000 patient-days. No cases of VRE acquisition were found. Risk factors for ESBLE colonization on admission were: multiple contacts with the hospital within the previous year, chronic catheter use and a high level of dependency. For MRSA, risk factors were: chronic wounds, anti-acid use and a high level of dependency. CONCLUSION: This study shows a high prevalence of asymptomatic colonization of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli in patients admitted to an acute geriatric ward, as high as MRSA carriage. A low functional status is a common risk factor both for ESBLE and for MRSA colonization and it highlights the need to reinforce infection control measures.
