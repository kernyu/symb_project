Chalcones are known to act on various physiological targets. As a result, structural modifications of chalcones have been studied extensively. Benzochalcones, in which the A-ring of chalcone is substituted with a naphthalene unit, inhibits breast cancer resistance protein. Chalcones in which the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl group is switched with a pyrazoline moiety are potent cytotoxic agents against various cancer cell lines, and chalcones with a pyrazoline-1-carbothioamide group instead of an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl group exhibit antimicrobial activities. The present report describes hybrid molecules designed from benzochalcone and pyrazoline-carbothioamide. Methoxylation of plant-derived polyphenols alters their hydrophobicity, resulting in changes in biological function and intracellular compartmentation. In the current study, 22 novel methoxylated 3-(naphthalen-2-yl)-N,5-diphenyl-pyrazoline-1-carbothioamide derivatives were prepared. This report provides complete assignments of their (1)H and (13)C NMR data, which can be used to subsequently identify chalcones bearing pyrazoline-carbothioamide groups.
