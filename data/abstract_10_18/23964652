Ribosome, the protein synthesis machinery essential for all living cells, consists of ribosomal proteins and RNA. Extraribosomal functions have recently been discovered for many ribosomal proteins, acting either as individual regulatory proteins or as a complex with other cell components. However, extraribosomal functions of Mycobacterium tuberculosis ribosomal proteins have not been systematically addressed. To this end, M. tuberculosis ribosomal proteins potentially engaged in extraribosomal functions were curated by data mining from transcriptional profiles of M. tuberculosis exposed to diverse treatments. Six M. tuberculosis ribosomal proteins, namely, S3 (Rv0707, rpsC), L16 (Rv0708, rplP), L29 (Rv0709, rpmC), S17 (Rv0710, rpsQ), S14 (Rv2056c, rpsN2), and L33 (Rv2057c, rpmG1), were found to behave idiosyncratically. The function of these abnormal ribosomal subunits can be further explored. Special emphasis is on their potential value as novel targets for better antibiotics.
