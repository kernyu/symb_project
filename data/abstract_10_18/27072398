Clonal dissemination is characteristic of the important nosocomial pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii, as revealed by previous multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) studies. However, the disseminated phyletic unit is actually MLST sequence type instead of real bacterial clone. Here we sequenced the genomes of 13 multidrug-resistant (MDR) A. baumannii strains from Taiwan, and compared them with that of A. baumannii from other East Asian countries. Core-genome phylogenetic tree divided the analyzed strains into three major clades. Among them, one ST455 clade was a hybrid between the ST208 clade and the other ST455 clade. Several strains showed nearly identical genome sequence, but their isolation sources differed by over 2,500 km and 10 years apart, suggesting a wide dissemination of the phyletic units, which were much smaller than the sequence type. Frequent structural variation was detected even between the closely related strains in antimicrobial resistance elements such as AbaRI, class I integron, indicating strong selection pressure brought by antimicrobial use. In conclusion, wide clonal dissemination and frequent genomic variation simultaneously characterize the clinical MDR A. baumannii in East Asia.
