Although the roles of introns have been much debated in eukaryotic organisms, none of them have been functionally characterized in Fusarium graminearum. In this study, we characterized the roles of introns in regulation of fungicide-sensitivity of F. graminearum. beta2 tub, cyp51A and myosin-5 are important target genes of benzimidazoles, triazoles and cyanoacrylates respectively. To explore the sensitivity regulation functions of introns in target genes, several detailed deletion studies were completed on the intronic regions of beta2 tub, cyp51A and myosin-5. Phenotypic analyses showed that deletion of the fourth intron from beta2 tub gene (designated beta2 Deltai4), the sole intron from cyp51A gene (cyp51A-Deltai) and the second intron from myosin-5 gene (myo5-Deltai2) exhibited an increased sensitivity to corresponding fungicides. In contrast, deletion of the first or second intron from beta2 tub gene exhibited a decreased sensitivity to carbendazim. qRT-PCR showed that the mRNA transcript levels of target genes were significantly downregulated in beta2 Deltai4, cyp51A-Deltai and myo5-Deltai2 respectively. Meanwhile, Western blot assays revealed that the protein expression levels of beta2 tub was also dramatically reduced in beta2 Deltai4, but accumulated in beta2 Deltai1 and beta2 Deltai2. Overall, our results indicate that introns in target genes significantly regulate the fungicide-sensitivity by influencing expression of the corresponding resident genes in F. graminearum.
