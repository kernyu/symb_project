The genetic diversity among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) subtypes as well as the variability of viral sequences found in HIV-infected individuals presents a number of difficult obstacles for the development of universally effective HIV treatment and prevention methods. Here, we present a brief summary of recent developments in the analysis of viral genetics and human genomics to provide insight into future methods for HIV treatment and prevention. Recent studies have mined viral sequences found in newly infected individuals to identify common features of all transmitted viruses that could provide potential targets for HIV vaccine development. Analysis of human immunogenetics has identified specific alleles associated with reduced virus loads in HIV-infected individuals providing valuable information that may influence individual responses to treatment and prevention methods. Increased sensitivity of antiretroviral drug resistance testing has improved the detection of hidden drug resistant virus but also highlighted the potential for drug resistant viruses to reduce the effectiveness of clinical treatment regimens. The rapidly expanding amount of data generated by studies of viral genetics and human immunogenetics will provide valuable information to guide the design of new strategies to improve clinical treatment and enhance HIV vaccine development.
