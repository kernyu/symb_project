During an area-based study, 75 group B streptococcus (GBS) strains isolated both from early-onset disease (EOD, 37 strains) and from late-onset disease (LOD, 38 strains) were analysed for serotype, pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing profiles, protein markers and antibiotic resistance. Serotype III, possessing the rib gene, was the most frequent (54 strains, 72%) and responsible for 89.5% and 54% of LOD and EOD, respectively. Forty-six serotype III strains belonged to the same PFGE type and clonal complex 17, already described as an over-represented clone in neonatal invasive GBS infections. Other serotypes were Ia (9.3%), II (6.7%), Ib (5.3%), V (5.3%) and IV (1.3%). Seventeen PFGE groups were identified comprising strains with related sequence types; conversely, strains displaying the same sequence type could belong to different PFGE groups. When both neonate and maternal strains from vaginorectal swabs and/or milk were available (eight cases), they were indistinguishable. Resistance to erythromycin (12%) was associated with a constitutive resistance to clindamycin in five cases (four carrying the erm(B) gene and one both the erm(B) and mef(E) genes) and with an inducible clindamycin resistance in two cases (one possessing the erm(A) gene, the other the erm(T) gene). Two isolates displayed the M phenotype (mef(E) gene). All strains but five were resistant to tetracycline, mostly mediated by the tet(M) gene (97.1%). The study underlined the importance of an active surveillance system for the elucidation of a GBS population structure causing neonatal infections and allowed the detection of rare antibiotic resistance determinants [erm(T)].
