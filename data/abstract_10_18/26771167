Rice is one of the most important crops worldwide and is widely used as a model plant for molecular studies of monocotyledonous species. The plant hormone jasmonic acid (JA) is involved in rice-pathogen interactions. In addition, volatile compounds, including terpenes, whose production is induced by JA, are known to be involved in the rice defense system. In this study, we analyzed the JA-induced terpene synthase OsTPS24 in rice. We found that OsTPS24 was localized in chloroplasts and produced a monoterpene, gamma-terpinene. The amount of gamma-terpinene increased after JA treatment. gamma-Terpinene had significant antibacterial activity against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo); however, it did not show significant antifungal activity against Magnaporthe oryzae. The antibacterial activity of the gamma-terpinene against Xoo was caused by damage to bacterial cell membranes. These results suggest that gamma-terpinene plays an important role in JA-induced resistance against Xoo, and that it functions as an antibacterial compound in rice.
