The efficacy of poly D,L-lactide-co-glycolic acid (PLGA)-liposome (L) encapsulated oligodeoxynucleotides with unmethylated deoxycytidyl-deoxyguanosine motifs (CpG-ODNs) on innate and adaptive immune response and disease resistance in kelp grouper (Epinephelus bruneus) against Vibrio alginolyticus at weeks 1, 2, and 4 is reported. The superoxide dismutase (SOD), respiratory burst, and lysozyme activities significantly increased in E. bruneus when immunized with ODN, PLGA+ODN, L+ODN, and PLGA+L+ODN on weeks 2 and 4. The serum complement activity was significantly enhanced with L+ODN and PLGA+L+ODN on week 1 while it increased with PLGA+ODN, L+ODN, and PLGA+L+ODN on weeks 2 and 4. The antibody titre consistently was increased with PLGA or L encapsulated with ODN (PLGA+ODN, L+ODN, and PLGA+L+ODN) from weeks 1 to 4. The cumulative mortality was 20% each in PLGA+ODN administered groups and 15% each in ODN, L+ODN, and PLGA+L+ODN groups during a period of 30 days. The present study suggests that PLGA-liposome encapsulated ODN has the potential to modulate the immune system and can serve as a useful tool for further design of immunoprophylatic nano drug formulations against bacterial diseases.
