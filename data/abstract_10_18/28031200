Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates have been increasingly reported worldwide, and therapeutic options to treat infections caused by these organisms are limited. We evaluated the activity of ceftazidime-avibactam and comparators against 456 Enterobacteriaceae isolates carrying blaKPC collected from 79 U.S. hospitals during 2012 to 2015. Overall, ceftazidime-avibactam (MIC50/90, 0.5/2 mug/ml; 99.3% susceptible) and tigecycline (MIC50/90, 0.5/1 mug/ml; 98.9% susceptible at </=2 mug/ml) were the most active agents. Only 80.5% and 59.0% of isolates were susceptible to colistin and amikacin, respectively. All three isolates (0.7%) displaying resistance to ceftazidime-avibactam (K. pneumoniae; MICs, >/=16 mug/ml) were evaluated using whole-genome sequencing analysis and relative quantification of expression levels of porins and efflux pump. Two isolates carried metallo-beta-lactamase genes, blaNDM-1 or blaVIM-4, among other beta-lactam resistance mechanisms, and one displayed a premature stop codon in ompK35 and decreased expression of ompK36 Ceftazidime-avibactam was active against 100.0 and 99.3% of isolates carrying blaKPC-3 (n = 221) and blaKPC-2 (n = 145), respectively. Isolates carrying blaKPC were more commonly recovered from pneumonia (n = 155), urinary tract (n = 93), and skin/soft tissue (n = 74) infections. Ceftazidime-avibactam (97.8 to 100.0% susceptible) was consistently active against isolates from all infection sites. K. pneumoniae (83.3% of the collection) susceptibility rates were 99.2% for ceftazidime-avibactam, 98.9% for tigecycline, and 80.1% for colistin. Ceftazidime-avibactam susceptibility did not vary substantially when comparing isolates from intensive care unit (ICU) patients to those from non-ICU patients. Ceftazidime-avibactam was active against this large collection of isolates carrying blaKPC and represents a valuable addition to the armamentarium currently available for the treatment of infections caused by KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae.
