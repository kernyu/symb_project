The accurate detection of carbapenemase-producing organisms is a major challenge for clinical laboratories. The Carba NP test is highly accurate but inconvenient, as it requires frequent preparation of fresh imipenem solution. The current study was designed to compare the Carba NP test to two alternative tests for accuracy and convenience. These were a modified Carba NP test that utilized intravenous (i.v.) imipenem-cilastatin, which is less expensive than reference standard imipenem powder, and an updated version of the Rosco Neo-Rapid Carb kit, which does not require the preparation of imipenem solution and has a shelf life of 2 years. The comparison included 87 isolates that produced class A carbapenemases (including KPC-2, -3, -4, -5, -6, and -8, NMC-A, and SME type), 40 isolates that produced metallo-beta-lactamases (including NDM-1, GIM-1, SPM-1, IMP-1, -2, -7, -8, -18, and -27, and VIM-1, -2, and -7), 11 isolates that produced OXA-48, and one isolate that produced OXA-181. Negative controls consisted of 50 isolates that produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), AmpCs (including hyperproducers), K1, other limited-spectrum beta-lactamases, and porin and efflux mutants. Each test exhibited 100% specificity and high sensitivity (Carba NP, 100%; Rosco, 99% using modified interpretation guidelines; and modified Carba NP, 96%). A modified approach to interpretation of the Rosco test was necessary to achieve the sensitivity of 99%. If the accuracy of the modified interpretation is confirmed, the Rosco test is an accurate and more convenient alternative to the Carba NP test.
