beta-Defensins are cysteine-rich endogenously produced antimicrobial peptides that play an important role in innate immunity. In this study, the expressions of genes porcine beta-defensins-1(pBD-1), pBD-2 and pBD-3 were determined using real-time PCR for Chinese Meishan pigs and Crossbred (Duroc x Yorkshire x Landrace) pigs of 7 days old in various tissues. The results showed that expressions of pBD-1, 2 and 3 of Meishan pigs in most tissues were higher than those of crossbred pigs and main expression sites for pBD-1 and pBD-3 were tongue and oral mucosa in two varieties of pigs, whereas pBD-2 of crossbred pig was mainly expressed in kidney and liver, and pBD-2 of Meishan pigs mainly in tongue and oral mucosa. The higher expression of pBDs might be the reason of Meishan pigs has higher immunity and disease resistance. The mechanisms of this need a further research.
