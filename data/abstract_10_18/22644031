Although resistance to tigecycline has been reported in surveillance studies, very few reports have described the emergence of resistance in vivo. We report two cases of patients with infections due to SHV-12-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and K. pneumoniae carbapenemase-3 (KPC-3)-producing Escherichia coli, which developed tigecycline resistance in vivo after treatment. The reported limited experience underlines the risk of occurrence of a tigecycline MIC increase under treatment pressure.
