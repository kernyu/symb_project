Long-term antiviral therapy of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection can lead to the selection of drug-resistant HBV variants and treatment failure. Moreover, these HBV strains are possibly present in treatment-naive patients. Currently available assays for the detection of HBV drug resistance can identify mutants that constitute >/=5% of the viral population. Furthermore, drug-resistant HBV variants can be detected when a viral load is >10(4) copies/ml (1,718 IU/ml). The aim of this study was to compare matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and multitemperature single-strand conformation polymorphism (MSSCP) with commercially available assays for the detection of drug-resistant HBV strains. HBV DNA was extracted from 87 serum samples acquired from 45 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. The 37 selected HBV variants were analyzed in 4 separate primer extension reactions on the MALDI-TOF MS. Moreover, MSSCP for identifying drug-resistant HBV YMDD variants was developed and turned out to be more sensitive than INNOLiPA HBV DR and direct sequencing. MALDI-TOF MS had the capability to detect mutant strains within a mixed viral population occurring with an allelic frequency of approximately 1% (with a specific value of >/=10(2) copies/ml, also expressed as >/=17.18 IU/ml). In our study, MSSCP detected 98% of the HBV YMDD variants among strains detected by the MALDI-TOF MS assay. The routine tests revealed results of 40% and 11%, respectively, for INNOLiPA and direct sequencing. The commonly available HBV tests are less sensitive than MALDI-TOF MS in the detection of HBV-resistant variants, including quasispecies.
