OBJECTIVES: Continued selective pressure from glycopeptide use has led to non-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus, including vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA). Though relatively uncommon, VISA presents a particularly difficult clinical challenge when it arises. Pertinent to this investigation is the correlation between vancomycin intermediacy and daptomycin non-susceptibility. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential for synergy between daptomycin and nafcillin against VISA. METHODS: Twenty VISA strains were evaluated for daptomycin and nafcillin MICs by broth microdilution in duplicate. Potential for synergy was assessed by time-kill at 0.5x MIC in triplicate. Four strains displaying synergy in time-kill analysis were analysed in an in vitro pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) model in duplicate over 72 h. RESULTS: In time-kill experiments, 55% of strains (11/20) displayed synergy with the combination. In the PK/PD model, no differences between daptomycin-alone and combination regimens were observed for the strain with the lowest daptomycin MIC (0.5 mg/L). For the strain with a daptomycin MIC of 1 mg/L, 6 mg/kg daptomycin+nafcillin was superior to 6 mg/kg daptomycin alone (P=0.002) and 10 mg/kg daptomycin+nafcillin was superior to all other regimens (P </= 0.004). When the daptomycin MIC increased to 2 mg/L, 10 mg/kg daptomycin+nafcillin was superior to 6 mg/kg daptomycin+nafcillin, which was superior to both 6 and 10 mg/kg daptomycin alone (P </= 0.019). CONCLUSIONS: Daptomycin and nafcillin in combination significantly improved antibacterial activity against VISA. This effect was more pronounced as the daptomycin susceptibility of the strain declined.
