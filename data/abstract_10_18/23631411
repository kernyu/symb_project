The thienopyrimidinone 5,6-dimethyl-2-(4-nitrophenyl)thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4(3H)-one (DNTP) occupies the interface between the p66 ribonuclease H (RNase H) domain and p51 thumb of human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase (HIV RT), thereby inducing a conformational change incompatible with catalysis. Here, we combined biochemical characterization of 39 DNTP derivatives with antiviral testing of selected compounds. In addition to wild-type HIV-1 RT, derivatives were evaluated with rationally designed, p66/p51 heterodimers exhibiting high-level DNTP sensitivity or resistance. This strategy identified 3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl (catechol) substituted thienopyrimidinones with submicromolar in vitro activity against both wild type HIV-1 RT and drug-resistant variants. Thermal shift analysis indicates that, in contrast to active site RNase H inhibitors, these thienopyrimidinones destabilize the enzyme, in some instances reducing the Tm by 5 degrees C. Importantly, catechol-containing thienopyrimidinones also inhibit HIV-1 replication in cells. Our data strengthen the case for allosteric inhibition of HIV RNase H activity, providing a platform for designing improved antagonists for use in combination antiviral therapy.
