Second-generation genome sequencing and alignment of the resulting reads to in silico genomes containing antimicrobial resistance and virulence factor genes were used to screen for undesirable genes in 28 strains which could be used in human nutrition. No virulence factor genes were detected, while several isolates contained antimicrobial resistance genes.
