Eleven protease mutations have been associated with reduced susceptibility to darunavir. In this study of 87 HIV-1-infected patients experiencing virological failure to second-line regimens containing protease inhibitors boosted with ritonavir (viral load >1,000 HIV RNA copies/ml), we observed a low prevalence (3%) of >/=3 darunavir resistance-associated mutations, indicating that this drug may be a good option for third-line antiretroviral therapy in southern India.
