Drug resistant tuberculosis (TB) has reached alarming proportions in South Africa, draining valuable resources that are needed to fight drug susceptible TB. It is currently estimated that 9.6% of all TB cases have multi-drug resistant (MDR)-TB, thereby ranking South Africa as one of the highest MDR-TB burden countries in the world. Molecular epidemiological studies have demonstrated the complexity of the epidemic and have clearly shown that the epidemic is driven by transmission as a consequence of low cases detection and diagnostic delay. The latter has in turn fueled the amplification of drug resistance, ultimately leading to the emergence of extensively drug resistant (XDR)-TB. Despite the introduction of new drugs to combat this scourge, culture conversion rates for XDR-TB remain below 20%. Failure to achieve cure may be explained from DNA sequencing results which have demonstrated mutations in 7 genes encoding resistance to at least 8 anti-TB drugs. This review shows how molecular epidemiology has provided novel insights into the MDR-TB epidemic in South Africa and thereby has highlighted the challenges that need to be addressed regarding the diagnosis and treatment of MDR-TB. An important step towards for curbing this epidemic will be collaboration between clinicians, laboratories and researchers to establish scientific knowledge and medical expertise to more efficiently guide public health policy.
