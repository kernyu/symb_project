Oxazolidinones are a novel class of synthetic antibacterial agents that inhibit bacterial protein synthesis. Here, we synthesized and tested a series of oxazolidinone compounds containing cyclic amidrazone. Among these compounds, we further investigated the antibacterial activities of LCB01-0648 against drug-susceptible or resistant Gram-positive cocci in comparison with those of six reference compounds. LCB01-0648 showed the most potent antimicrobial activities against clinically isolated Gram-positive bacteria. Against the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCNS) isolates, LCB01-0648 showed the lowest MIC90s (0.5 mg/L) among the tested compounds. In addition, LCB01-0648 had the lowest minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against the four linezolid-resistant S. aureus (LRSA) strains (range 2-4 mg/L). The results of the time-kill studies demonstrated that LCB01-0648 at a concentration 8x the (MIC) showed bactericidal activity against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus MSSA or MRSA, but showed a bacteriostatic effect against LRSA. These results indicate that LCB01-0648 could be a good antibacterial candidate against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-positive cocci.
