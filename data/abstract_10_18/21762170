There is limited information on antibiotic resistance determinants present in bacteria of aquaculture origin in Australia. The presence of integron and other resistance determinants was investigated in 90 Aeromonas isolates derived from nine freshwater trout farms in Victoria (Australia). Polymerase chain reaction was carried out for the detection of integrase genes Int1, Int2 and Int3, gene cassette array, integron-associated aadA, sul1 and qac1 genes, streptomycin resistance genes strA-strB, beta-lactamase resistance genes bla(TEM) and bla(SHV) , and tetracycline resistance genes tetA-E and tetM. Clonal analysis was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Class 1 integrons were detected in 28/90 (31%) and class 2 and class 3 in none of the strains, aadA gene in 19/27 (70%) streptomycin-resistant strains, sul1 in 13/15 (86.7%) sulphonamide-resistant strains and qac1 gene in 8/28 (28.6%) integron-bearing strains. Five strains from two different farms carried gene cassettes of 1000 bp each containing the aadA2 gene and PFGE analysis revealed genetic relatedness. tetC was detected in all and tetA in 9/18 (50%) tetracycline-resistant strains. The strA-strB, bla(TEM) or bla(SHV) genes were not detected in any of the strains. Aeromonas spp. carrying integrons and other resistance genes are present in farm-raised fish and sediments even though no antibiotics were licensed for use in Australian aquaculture at the time of the study.
