WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Hospital-based pharmacists are established antibiotic stewards, but the potential for community pharmacists is largely untapped. This commentary explores the potential leadership role of the community pharmacist in antibiotic stewardship using upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) as an example. COMMENT: Community pharmacists are well placed for antibiotic stewardship, possessing the capability (knowledge of medicines), opportunity (contact with prescribers and patients) and inherent commitment. Providing further motivation with information on patient education has great potential to change patient behaviour with respect to consulting a healthcare professional for an antibiotic prescription. A Global Respiratory Infection Partnership pharmacy-led educational initiative was shown to have a positive impact and can promote appropriate self-management of URTI and reduce levels of inappropriate antibiotic use. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Community pharmacists are ideally placed as antibiotic stewards to lead the quest to contain the threat of antibiotic resistance.
