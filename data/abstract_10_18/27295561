Bacterial infections resulting from nonsurgical traumatic wounds can be life threatening, especially those caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria with limited therapeutic options. The antimicrobial activity of polymyxin B (1) and curcumin (2) alone and in combination was determined versus MDR bacterial isolates associated with traumatic wound infections. Cytotoxicity assays for 1 and 2 were undertaken in keratinocyte cell lines. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of 1 were significantly reduced in the presence of 2 (3- to 10-fold reduction), with synergy observed. Time-kill assays showed the combinations produced bactericidal activity. Cytotoxicity assays indicate the toxicity of 2 was reduced in the presence of 1.
