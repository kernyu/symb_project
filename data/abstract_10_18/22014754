Antimicrobial resistance represents a global threat to healthcare. The ability to adequately treat infectious diseases is increasingly under siege due to the emergence of drug-resistant microorganisms. New approaches to drug development are especially needed to target organisms that exhibit broad antibiotic resistance due to expression of beta-lactamases which is the most common mechanism by which bacteria become resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. We designed and synthesized 20 novel monocyclic beta-lactams with alkyl- and aryl-thio moieties at C4, and subsequently tested these for antibacterial activity. These compounds demonstrated intrinsic activity against serine beta-lactamase producing Mycobacterium tuberculosis wild type strain (Mtb) and multiple (n=6) beta-lactamase producing Moraxella catarrhalis clinical isolates.
