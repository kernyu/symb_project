Antibiotic resistance is an emerging problem worldwide present in many bacteria, specially in Escherichia coli, which has high percentages of resistance to ampicilline, thrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and nalidixic acid, which implies important complications in antibiotic treatment when required. The increasing antibiotic resistance is due to the acquisition of different molecular mechanisms of resistance through point chromosomal mutations and /or horizontal transfer of genetic material between related or different species facilitated by some genetic elements such as integrons. This review discusses the effects of the most common molecular mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in E. coli: enzymatic inactivation, changes in the target site and permeability disturbances. Getting to know the mechanisms of resistance which are involved, as the World Health Organization recommends, will allow us to improve the surveillance of the antibiotic resistance, the control policies and the antibiotic utilization at a national level.
