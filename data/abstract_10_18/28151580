Ebselen (EB, compound 1) is an investigational organoselenium compound that reduces fungal growth, in part, through inhibition of the fungal plasma membrane H(+) -ATPase (Pma1p). In the present study, the growth inhibitory activity of EB and of five structural analogs was assessed in a fluconazole (FLU)-resistant strain of Candida albicans (S2). While none of the compounds were more effective than EB at inhibiting fungal growth (IC50 approximately 18 muM), two compounds, compounds 5 and 6, were similar in potency. Medium acidification assays performed with S2 yeast cells revealed that compounds 4 and 6, but not compounds 2, 3, or 5, exerted an inhibitory activity comparable to EB (IC50 approximately 14 muM). Using a partially purified Pma1p preparation obtained from S2 yeast cells, EB and all the analogs demonstrated a similar inhibitory activity. Taken together, these results indicate that EB analogs are worth exploring further for use as growth inhibitors of FLU-resistant fungi.
