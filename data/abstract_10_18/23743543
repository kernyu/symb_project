We report the second pediatric case of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae in the United States. Laboratory methods included various phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing assays, as well as polymerase chain reaction assays for carbapenemase-encoding genes. Laboratory challenges and the limited number of effective antimicrobial agents and the lack of pediatric-specific safety and efficacy data for these drugs are discussed.
