Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a leading cause of hospital-acquired infections and is resistant to many antibiotics. Among its primary mechanisms of resistance is expression of a chromosomally encoded AmpC beta-lactamase that inactivates beta-lactams. The mechanisms leading to AmpC expression in P. aeruginosa remain incompletely understood but are intricately linked to cell wall metabolism. To better understand the roles of peptidoglycan-active enzymes in AmpC expression-and consequent beta-lactam resistance-a phenotypic screen of P. aeruginosa mutants lacking such enzymes was performed. Mutants lacking one of four lytic transglycosylases (LTs) or the nonessential penicillin-binding protein PBP4 (dacB) had altered beta-lactam resistance. mltF and slt mutants with reduced beta-lactam resistance were designated WIMPs (wall-impaired mutant phenotypes), while highly resistant dacB, sltB1, and mltB mutants were designated HARMs (high-level AmpC resistant mutants). Double mutants lacking dacB and sltB1 had extreme piperacillin resistance (>256 mug/ml) compared to either of the single knockouts (64 mug/ml for a dacB mutant and 12 mug/ml for an sltB1 mutant). Inactivation of ampC reverted these mutants to wild-type susceptibility, confirming that AmpC expression underlies resistance. dacB mutants had constitutively elevated AmpC expression, but the LT mutants had wild-type levels of AmpC in the absence of antibiotic exposure. These data suggest that there are at least two different pathways leading to AmpC expression in P. aeruginosa and that their simultaneous activation leads to extreme beta-lactam resistance.
