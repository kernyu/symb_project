Beneficial effects of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in patients with severe steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) have been reported. However, controversy exists about the effect of MSCs on virus-specific T cells. We evaluated 56 patients with grade II-IV aGvHD who responded to steroids (n = 21) or were steroid refractory receiving either MSCs (n = 22) or other second-line therapy (n = 13). Although the overall incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus, and human adenovirus (HAdV) infections was not significantly increased, HAdV infection was associated with decreased survival in children treated with MSCs. Thus, we investigated in vitro the effects of MSCs on virus-specific T cells. Both CMV-specific and, to a lesser extent, HAdV-specific T-cell activation and proliferation were negatively affected by MSCs either after induction of a response in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or after restimulation of virus-specific T-cell lines. In patient-derived PBMCs, CMV-specific proliferative responses were greatly decreased on first-line treatment of aGvHD with systemic steroids and slowly recovered after MSC administration and tapering of steroids. HAdV-specific T-cell proliferation could not be detected. In contrast, the proportion of CMV- and HAdV-specific effector T cells, measured as interferon-gamma-secreting cells, remained stable or increased after treatment with MSCs. In conclusion, although in vitro experimental conditions indicated a negative impact of MSCs on CMV- and HAdV-specific T-cell responses, no solid evidence was obtained to support such an effect of MSCs on T-cell responses in vivo. Still, the susceptibility of steroid-refractory severe aGvHD patients to viral reactivation warrants critical viral monitoring during randomized controlled trials on second-line treatment including MSCs.
