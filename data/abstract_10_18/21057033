Malaria is a potentially life-threatening disease caused by protozoal parasites of the genus Plasmodium. It is mainly a problem in developing countries, and cases in the UK involve travellers coming from endemic areas. Resistance is increasing to several antimalarial drugs (e.g. chloroquine, mefloquine, antifolates). Another group of drugs, known as artemisinins, have come into widespread use more recently. An oral artemisinin-combination therapy (ACT) is now one of the standard licensed treatments for uncomplicated malaria in the UK. However, the parenteral artemisinin for severe malaria, artesunate, is not licensed in developed countries. Here we consider the role of artemisinins as treatment for malaria in the UK.
