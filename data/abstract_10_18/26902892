A novel drug delivery system, chitosan-microcapsules/starch blend film for antofloxacin controlled release, was prepared, and characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (X-RD), thermogravimetry and derivative thermogravimetry (TG/DTG), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Following incorporation of the chitosan-microcapsules in the film matrix, the synergistic interactions between these drug-carriers were significant. The thermostability and mechanical properties of the blend film were greatly improved by the incorporation of the microcapsules. The water resistance of the blend film was enhanced by increasing the content of microcapsules, indicating that the microcapsules acted as moisture barriers. After being incorporated, chitosan-microcapsules/starch blend film shows a sustained drug release. The extent of the film degradation and microcapsules swelling in the release system indicated that the drug released of the blend film was pH-sensitive. The blend film exhibited pharmacodynamic efficacy because of the efficient drug releasing.
