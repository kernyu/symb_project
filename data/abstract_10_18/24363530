AIM: To study the clinical outcome of antiviral therapy in hepatitis B-related decompensated cirrhotic patients. METHODS: Three hundred and twelve patients with decompensated hepatitis B cirrhosis were evaluated in a prospective cohort. With two years of follow-up, 198 patients in the group receiving antiviral therapy with nucleos(t)ide analogues and 39 patients in the control group without antiviral treatment were analysed. RESULTS: Among the antiviral treatment patients, 162 had a complete virological response (CVR), and 36 were drug-resistant (DR). The two-year cumulative incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the DR patients (30.6%) was significantly higher than that in both the CVR patients (4.3%) and the control group (10.3%) (P < 0.001). Among the DR patients in particular, the incidence of HCC was 55.6% (5/9) in those who failed rescue therapy, which was extremely high. The rtA181T mutation was closely associated with rescue therapy failure (P = 0.006). The Child-Pugh scores of the CVR group were significantly decreased compared with the baseline (8.9 +/- 2.3 vs 6.0 +/- 1.3, P = 0.043). CONCLUSION: This study showed that antiviral drug resistance increased the risk of HCC in decompensated hepatitis B-related cirrhotic patients, especially in those who failed rescue therapy.
