Chronic wounds are a rare complication of X-linked agammaglobulinaemia (XLA). Fastidious organisms such as helicobacter bills have been reported in XLA with chronic wounds but sterile chronic wounds also occur. Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy has been used in chronic wounds but has not previously been reported in primary antibody deficiencies. We present a case of a chronic wound in a patient with XLA refractory to antimicrobial therapy that made a remarkable recovery following Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy.
