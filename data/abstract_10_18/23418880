A new denitroaristolochic acid, demethylaristofolin C (1), together with six known alkaloids, crebanine N-oxide (2), (-)-sukhodianine-beta-N-oxide (3), palmatine (4), corydalmine (5), dehydrocorydalmine (6), and corynoxidine (7), was isolated from the tubers of Stephania succifera. The structure of demethylaristofolin C was elucidated by spectroscopic techniques (UV, IR, 1D, and 2D NMR) and HR-ESI-MS analyses. These compounds exhibited antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains in different degrees.
