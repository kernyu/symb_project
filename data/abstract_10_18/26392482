An Enterobacter cloacae isolate was recovered from a rectal swab from a patient hospitalized in France with previous travel to Switzerland. It was resistant to penicillins, narrow- and broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, and carbapenems but remained susceptible to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins. Whereas PCR-based identification of the most common carbapenemase genes failed, the biochemical Carba NP test II identified an Ambler class A carbapenemase. Cloning experiments followed by sequencing identified a gene encoding a totally novel class A carbapenemase, FRI-1, sharing 51 to 55% amino acid sequence identity with the closest carbapenemase sequences. However, it shared conserved residues as a source of carbapenemase activity. Purified beta-lactamase FRI-1 hydrolyzed penicillins, aztreonam, and carbapenems but spared expanded-spectrum cephalosporins. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of clavulanic acid and tazobactam were 10-fold higher than those found for Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), IMI, and SME, leading to lower sensitivity of FRI-1 activity to beta-lactamase inhibitors. The blaFRI-1 gene was located on a ca. 110-kb untypeable, transferable, and non-self-conjugative plasmid. A putative LysR family regulator-encoding gene at the 5' end of the beta-lactamase gene was identified, leading to inducible expression of the blaFRI-1 gene.
