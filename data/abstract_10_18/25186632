AIM: Compare the displacement resistance of AH Plus, Ad Seal and Real Seal on dentine discs (DDs) treated with 10% citric acid, 17% EDTA or 2.5% NaOCl, through a new push-out test method. METHODOLOGY: From the middle third of the roots of 15 maxillary central incisors, three dentine discs 1 +/- 0.1 mm thick were obtained. On the axial surface of each dentine disc, three 1.2-mm-wide holes were drilled. In the third dentine disc from the same root, each hole was treated with one of three irrigating solutions for 30 s, rinsed with distilled water and dried. Each hole of the same dentine disc was filled with sealer, and the discs were maintained at 37 degrees C for 7 days. The dentine discs were fixed on a testing machine to test the shear strength. Data were compared using the univariate anova test with a 5% significance level. The Tukey test was used for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: The irrigating solutions did not affect the adhesion of the sealers (P > 0.05). There was no significant difference between the Ad Seal and AHPlus (P > 0.05); however, Real Seal had a significantly lower shear bond strength (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The use of different irrigating solutions did not affect resistance to the displacement of resin sealers. Real Seal sealer was less resistant than Ad Seal and AHPlus.
