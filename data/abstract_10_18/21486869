BACKGROUND: To assess the long-term effectiveness and safety of adefovir (ADV) plus lamivudine (LMV) in LMV-resistant (R) kidney transplants with chronic hepatitis B, 11 such patients were treated with add-on ADV. METHODS: Serum alanine aminotransferase, renal function and serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels were assessed every 3 months; ADV mutations were searched for by INNO-LiPA HBV DR v2 assay. RESULTS: During 36 months (12-48), nine patients cleared serum HBV DNA with a 3-year cumulative virological response rate of 88%, without the emergence of ADV mutations. ADV dose was reduced in six patients (55%) showing a decline of creatinine clearance, in the absence of proximal tubulopathy. CONCLUSIONS: In LMV-R kidney graft recipients, long-term add-on therapy with ADV is efficacious and safe with timely adaptation of ADV dose.
