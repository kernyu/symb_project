The incidence of tuberculosis decreases. However, clinical cases frequently raise questions, mainly in the context of contact tracing or when antimicrobial resistance is suspected. Empiric standard treatment consists of rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol and pyrazinamide. This initial regimen aims to reduce the number of pathogenic germs while the consolidation therapy should eradicate the remaining pathogens. Treatment duration and adherence are crucial for cure. For the treatment of latent tuberculosis the traditional 6 to 9 months isoniazid regimen is still the treatment of choice. In complex cases such as tuberculosis in immunocompromised patients or if resistant tuberculosis is suspected, patients should be referred to a specialized center.
