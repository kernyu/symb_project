BACKGROUND: Following an exceptionally high Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) incidence (Spring 2011) in a psychogeriatric long-term care facility, a bidirectional study (2009-2012) was initiated to identify determinants (retrospectively) and to assess intervention measures taken (prospectively). METHODS: For every CDI patient (de novo cases, relapses, and recurrences), a control patient (patient in the opposite room) was selected and risk factor analysis performed. Following the epidemic peak a more stringent hygienic protocol and surveillance program were implemented, as well as uniform guidelines for metronidazole and vancomycin prescription. RESULTS: The nutritional state (total protein/prealbumine) significantly differed between the CDI group (poorer nutritional state at admission) and the control group, and also antibiotic use (general) could be confirmed as a risk factor. A multi-disciplinary nutritional team has been established in order to improve the nutritional balance of our patients. CONCLUSIONS: Aside from stringent hygiene and antibiotic prescription stewardship, malnutrition of patients is a factor to be taken into account to contain a CDI outbreak in a long term care facility (LTCF).
