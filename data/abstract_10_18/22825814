The emergence of amino acid or nucleotide substitutions leads to lamivudine resistance in hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected patients. The aim of this study was to investigate whether viral sequences help predict the emergence of lamivudine resistance. The study subjects comprised 59 consecutive patients infected with HBV treated with daily therapy of 100 mg lamivudine. Among those, 32 patients with adequate pretreatment serum preservation were investigated for the correlation between viral amino acid substitutions and the appearance of lamivudine resistance with consideration of clinical background by determining dominant HBV full open reading frames. Viral resistance to lamivudine emerged in 28 of 59 patients (47%) in a median period of 2.45 years. Sequence comparisons of HBV genomes between patients who later developed lamivudine resistance and patients who did not revealed the existence of significant differences between the two groups in the pre-S1 84 (P = 0.042), pre-S2 1 (P = 0.017) and 22 (P = 0.015), and polymerase tp 95 (P = 0.046), judged by a log-rank test. Viral sequence analyses revealed the presence of amino acid substitutions in HBV pre-S1 and pre-S2 that may be associated with the emergence of lamivudine resistance during chronic HBV infection.
