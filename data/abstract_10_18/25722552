UNLABELLED: Severe sepsis often leads to multiple organ dysfunction syndromes (MODS) with acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI affects approximately, 35% of Intensive Care Unit patients, and most of these are due to sepsis. Mortality rate of sepsis-induced AKI is high. Inappropriate use of antimicrobials may be responsible for higher therapeutic failure, mortality rates, costs and toxicity as well as the emergence of resistance. Antimicrobial treatment is particularly difficult due to altered pharmacokinetic profile, dynamic changes in patient's clinical status and, in many cases, need for renal replacement therapy. This article aims to describe the appropriate antimicrobial dosing and reviews the factors contributing to the difficulties in establishing precise guidelines for antimicrobial dosing in sepsis-induced AKI patients.
