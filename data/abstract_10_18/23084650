Compromised flap perfusion can lead to the use of leech therapy to aid in flap salvage. Aeromonas hydrophila, a symbiont of the leech, is a well-known bacterial pathogen that has the potential to cause infection in patients receiving leech therapy. Ciprofloxacin is commonly regarded as the antibiotic of choice for prophylaxis against this pathogen. We present patient who underwent leech therapy during salvage attempts for a venous congested flap. A resultant infection developed despite being on appropriate antibiotics. Culture sensitivities indicated that A. hydrophila was resistant to ciprofloxacin.
