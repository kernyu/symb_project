After recent hospitalization in India (New Delhi and Mumbai), 2 patients, on their return to Canada, presented with lower urinary tract infections due to multiresistant Klebsiella pneumoniae that produced New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase and CTX-M-15. The organisms belonged to clones ST147 and ST340, and were positive for aac(6')-Ib-cr, as well as for the ccdAB and vagCD addiction systems. The bla(NDM) plasmid was located on the IncFIIA and IncA/C replicon groups of plasmids. Clones ST147 and ST340 are also responsible for harbouring bla(KPC), and it is possible that they played an important role in the intercontinental spread of antimicrobial resistance.
