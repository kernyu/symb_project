PURPOSE: Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a mature (post-thymic) T-cell lymphoma associated with human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 infection. Survival in aggressive subtypes remains poor, and treatment resistance is frequent. Use of zidovudine (ZDV) and interferon alfa (IFN-alpha) has been associated with improved response rates in small studies and prolonged overall survival in leukemic ATLL subtypes in a recent meta-analysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report the clinicopathologic characteristics, treatment, and outcome of 73 patients with aggressive ATLL (acute ATLL, 29; lymphoma ATLL, 44) diagnosed and treated in England between 1999 and 2009. The impact of ZDV/IFN-alpha on treatment response and survival was assessed. RESULTS: The overall response rate ranged from 49% with chemotherapy alone to 81% with combined first-line therapy (chemotherapy with concurrent/sequential ZDV/IFN-alpha). Median overall survival (OS) was 9 months: 7.5 months for acute ATLL and 10 months for lymphoma ATLL. Use of ZDV/IFN-alpha at any time prolonged survival in acute (P < .001) and lymphoma ATLL (P < .001) and was the sole factor associated with reduction in risk of death in aggressive ATLL (hazard ratio, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.60; P = .002). Combined first-line therapy prolonged median OS in acute (P = .0081) and lymphoma ATLL (P = .001) compared with chemotherapy alone. CONCLUSION: These data support the use of low-dose ZDV/IFN-alpha with chemotherapy in first-line treatment of acute and lymphoma ATLL.
