Bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents has become an increasingly serious health problem in recent years. Among the strategies by which resistance can be achieved, overexpression of efflux pumps such as NorA of Staphylococcus aureus leads to a sub-lethal concentration of the antibacterial agent at the active site that in turn may predispose the organism to the development of high-level target-based resistance. With an aim to improve both the chemical stability and potency of our previously reported 3-phenyl-1,4-benzothiazine NorA inhibitors, we replaced the benzothiazine core with different nuclei. None of the new synthesized compounds showed any appreciable intrinsic antibacterial activity, and, in particular, 2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)quinoline (6 c) was able to decrease, in a concentration-dependent manner, the ciprofloxacin MIC against the norA-overexpressing strains S. aureus SA-K2378 (norA++) and SA-1199B (norA+/A116E GrlA).
