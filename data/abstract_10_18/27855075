Lefamulin, an investigational pleuromutilin, was tested against a collection of 18 macrolide-susceptible and 42 macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae strains, and the results were compared with those of azithromycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, doxycycline, and moxifloxacin testing. Lefamulin was highly active against all strains tested, with all MICs at </=0.008 mug/ml. The lefamulin MIC90 (0.002 mug/ml) for macrolide-resistant strains was the lowest among all drugs tested. Minimum bactericidal concentrations were within 2 dilutions of the MIC values, indicating a bactericidal effect.
