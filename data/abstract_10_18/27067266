BACKGROUND: Increased resistance to antimicrobial agents is a characteristic of many bacteria growing in biofilms on for example indwelling urinary catheters or in intracellular bacterial reservoirs. Biofilm-related infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria, such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, are a major challenge. The aim of this study was to investigate if a carbon monoxide-releasing molecule (CORM-2) has antibacterial effects against ESBL-producing uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) in the biofilm mode of growth and following colonization of host bladder epithelial cells. RESULTS: The effect of CORM-2 was examined on bacteria grown within an established biofilm (biofilm formed for 24 h on plastic surface) by a live/dead viability staining assay. CORM-2 (500 muM) exposure for 24 h killed approximately 60 % of the ESBL-producing UPEC isolate. A non-ESBL-producing UPEC isolate and the E. coli K-12 strain TG1 were also sensitive to CORM-2 exposure when grown in biofilms. The antibacterial effect of CORM-2 on planktonic bacteria was reduced and delayed in the stationary growth phase compared to the exponential growth phase. In human bladder epithelial cell colonization experiments, CORM-2 exposure for 4 h significantly reduced the bacterial counts of an ESBL-producing UPEC isolate. CONCLUSION: This study shows that CORM-2 has antibacterial properties against multidrug-resistant UPEC under biofilm-like conditions and following host cell colonization, which motivate further studies of its therapeutic potential.
