Glutathione is a tripeptide (l-gamma-glutamyl-l-cysteinyl-glycine) thiol compound existing in many bacteria and maintains a proper cellular redox state, thus protecting cells against toxic substances such as reactive oxygen species. Polyamines (spermine and spermidine) are low-molecular-weight aliphatic polycations ubiquitously presenting in all living cells and modulate many cellular functions. We previously reported that exogenous polyamines significantly enhanced beta-lactam susceptibility of beta-lactam-associated multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. In this study, three genes differentially associated with the polyamine effects on beta-lactam susceptibility were identified by transposon mutagenesis of A. baumannii ATCC 19606. All three genes encoded components of membrane transport systems. Inactivation of one of the genes encoding a putative glutathione transport ATP-binding protein increased the accumulation of intracellular glutathione ( approximately 150 to approximately 200%) and significantly decreased the polyamine effects on beta-lactam susceptibility in A. baumannii ATCC 19606. When the cells were grown with polyamines, the levels of intracellular glutathione in A. baumannii ATCC 19606 significantly decreased from approximately 0.5 to approximately 0.2 nmol, while the levels of extracellular glutathione were correspondingly increased. However, the levels of total glutathione (intra- plus extracellular) were unchanged when the cells were grown with or without polyamines. Overall, these results suggest that exogenous polyamines induce glutathione export, resulting in decreased levels of intracellular glutathione, which may produce an improper cellular redox state that is associated with the polyamine-mediated beta-lactam susceptibility of A. baumannii. This finding may provide a clue for development of new antimicrobial agents and/or novel strategies to treat multidrug-resistant A. baumannii.
