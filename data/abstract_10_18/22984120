In this study, we demonstrated that in vitro Candida albicans biofilms grown in the presence of diclofenac showed increased susceptibility to caspofungin. These findings were further confirmed using a catheter-associated biofilm model in rats. C. albicans-inoculated catheters retrieved from rats that were treated with both diclofenac and caspofungin contained significantly fewer biofilm cells and showed no visible biofilms inside the catheter lumens, as documented by scanning electron microscopy, as compared to catheters retrieved from rats receiving only caspofungin or diclofenac. This report indicates that diclofenac could be useful in combination therapy with caspofungin to treat C. albicans biofilm-associated infections.
