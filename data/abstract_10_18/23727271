OBJECTIVES: In this nationwide retrospective study, we analysed species distribution, antimicrobial susceptibility and time to next occurrence of Achromobacter in Danish cystic fibrosis (CF) patients from 2000 to 2011. METHODS: Thirty-four primary isolates were identified to species level and subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Effectiveness of early antimicrobial treatment was assessed by a Kaplan-Meier estimation of time to recurrence. RESULTS: Achromobacter xylosoxidans accounted for 13 (38%) of the isolates, and an unnamed species accounted for 11 (32%) of the isolates. Meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were highly active against chemotherapy-naive Achromobacter, while ceftazidime, colistin and tobramycin were judged adequate for inhalation therapy. Fifty-five percent of 25 patients treated with inhaled ceftazidime, colistin, or tobramycin remained free of Achromobacter three years after acquisition, in contrast to 17% of 22 patients who did not receive inhaled antibiotics (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Early treatment with inhaled antibiotics may prevent or postpone chronic infection with Achromobacter in CF patients.
