Pyrazinamide (PZA) is an important component of first-line therapy for the treatment of tuberculosis. Here, we evaluate targeted gene sequencing as a supplement to phenotypic PZA susceptibility testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Routine sequencing of pncA, but not rpsA, is effective for verification of PZA susceptibility results.
