The effect of Suaeda maritima enriched diet on blood physiology, innate immune response, and disease resistance in olive flounder Paralichythys olivaceus against Miamiensis avidus on weeks 1, 2, and 4 was investigated. Feeding with any enriched diet and then challenging with M. avidus significantly increased white blood cells (WBC) on weeks 2 and 4; the red blood cells (RBC) significantly increased with 0.1% and 1.0% enriched diets on week 4. The hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Ht) levels significantly increased when fed with 0.1% and 1.0% supplementation diets on weeks 2 and 4. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) did not significantly vary with any diet and time; however the mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) significantly increased with 0.1% and 1.0% supplementation diets on weeks 2 and 4. The leukocytes such as lymphocytes (Lym), monocytes (Mon), neutrophils (Neu) and biochemical parameters such as total protein (TP), glucose (GLU), and calcium (CAL) levels significantly increased in 0.1% and 1.0% supplementation diet fed groups on weeks 2 and 4. The serum lysozyme activity was significantly enhanced in 0.1% and 1.0% supplementation diet fed groups from weeks 1 to 4 when compared to the control (0% herbal extract enriched diet). The scuticocidal activity and respiratory burst activity were significantly enhanced when fish were fed with 0.1% and 1.0% supplementation diets from weeks 2 and 4. The protective effect in terms of cumulative mortality (50% and 40%) was low in groups on being fed with 0.1% and 1.0% supplemented diet. Therefore the present study suggested that 0.1% and 1.0% S. maritime-supplemented diets protect the hematological and biochemical parameters, improving the innate immunity, affording protection disease from M. avidus infection in olive flounder.
