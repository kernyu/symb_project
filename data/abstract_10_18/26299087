BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of Haemophilus influenzae in abscesses in adults and to determine their antibiotic resistance patterns. METHODS: H. influenzae strains isolated from abscesses during an eleven-year period were determined retrospectively and the stored strains were tested for ampicillin, amoxicillin/calvulanic acid, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, tetracycline, and imipenem resistance by broth microdilution method. The production of beta-lactamase was detected using the nitrocefin disc test and real-time PCR. RESULTS: A total of 26 H. influenzae isolated strains were found. According to ampicillin resistance and beta-lactamase production, 2 strains were determined as BLPAR, 1 strain BLNAR, 1 strain BLPACR, and 22 strains as BLNAS. Cefuroxime resistance was detected in 4 strains, tetracycline resistance was detected in 4 strains, and no resistance to cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, imipenem, azithromycin and levofloxacin was detected. CONCLUSIONS: H. influenzae should be taken into account for the proper management of abscesses.
