OBJECTIVES: Treated HIV-1-infected patients with lipodystrophy often develop insulin resistance and proatherogenic dyslipidaemia. Zinc alpha-2 glycoprotein (ZAG) is a recently characterized adipokine which has been shown to be involved in the development of obesity and metabolic syndrome in uninfected subjects. We assessed the relationship between circulating ZAG levels and metabolic derangements in HIV-1-infected patients receiving antiretroviral drugs. METHODS: Plasma ZAG levels were assessed in 222 individuals: 166 HIV-1-infected patients treated with antiretroviral drugs (77 with lipodystrophy and 89 without lipodystrophy) and 56 uninfected controls. Plasma ZAG levels were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and were correlated with fat distribution abnormalities and metabolic parameters. RESULTS: HIV-1-infected patients had lower plasma ZAG levels compared with uninfected controls (P < 0.001). No differences were found in ZAG plasma levels according to the presence of lipodystrophy, components of the metabolic syndrome or type of antiretroviral treatment regimen. Circulating ZAG levels were strongly determined by high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) in men (B = 0.644; P < 0.001) and showed a positive correlation with total cholesterol (r = 0.312; P < 0.001) and HDLc (r = 0.216; P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: HIV-1-infected patients have lower plasma ZAG levels than uninfected controls. In infected patients, plasma ZAG levels are in close relationship with total cholesterol and HDLc.
