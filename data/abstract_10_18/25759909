BACKGROUND: The goal of the present study was to explore the correlations of 1,5-anhydroglucitol (l,5-AG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and glycated albumin (GA) with insulin sensitivity and secretion. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In total, 302 patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (166 men, 136 women) were enrolled in this study. The homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and homeostasis model assessment for beta-cell function (HOMA-beta) were calculated to determine the basal insulin sensitivity and secretion. The insulinogenic index (IGI) was used to evaluate early-phase insulin secretion. 1,5-AG and GA were assayed via the enzymatic method, and HbA1c was detected by high-pressure liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Among all 302 subjects, the serum 1,5-AG level was 13.1+/-7.2 mug/mL, and the HbA1c and GA levels [median (interquartile range)] were 6.7% (6.2-7.3%) and 17.7% (16.0-19.5%), respectively. Increased 1,5-AG quartiles were accompanied by trends toward a decreased HOMA-IR and an increased HOMA-beta and IGI (for all trends, P<0.001). 1,5-AG was negatively associated with HOMA-IR (r=-0.200, P<0.001) and positively associated with HOMA-beta and IGI (r=0.210 and 0.413, respectively; both P<0.001). 1,5-AG was independently related to HOMA-IR and HOMA-beta and exhibited an independent positive association with IGI (standardized beta=0.242, P<0.001). Additionally, both HbA1c and GA were independently correlated with HOMA-IR and HOMA-beta. CONCLUSIONS: 1,5-AG is not only correlated with basal insulin sensitivity and secretion, but also closely associated with early-phase insulin secretion in Chinese patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus.
