New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-3 (NDM-3) was identified in a multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli isolate, NCGM77, obtained from the feces of a patient in Japan. The enzymatic activities of NDM-3 against beta-lactams were similar to those of NDM-1, although NDM-3 showed slightly lower kcat/Km ratios for all the beta-lactams tested except for doripenem. The genetic context for blaNDM-3 was tnpA-blaNDM-3-bleMBL-trpF-dsbC-tnpA-sulI-qacEdeltaI-aadA2-dfrA1, which was present on an approximately 250-kb plasmid.
