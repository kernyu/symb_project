The injectable long-acting formulation of rilpivirine (TMC278LA) is a promising preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) candidate for prevention of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. We evaluated HIV-1 in plasma obtained from an unexpected seroconverter in the 300-mg arm of the SSAT040 TMC278LA pharmacokinetic study for rilpivirine (RPV) resistance. Infection with wild-type HIV-1 was confirmed on day 84 after TMC278LA injection, and the K101E mutation was detected on day 115. Plasma-derived HIV-1 clones containing K101E had 4-fold increased resistance to RPV and 4-8-fold increased cross-resistance to etravirine, nevirapine, and efavirenz compared with wild type HIV-1 plasma-derived clones from the same individual. This case is a unique instance of infection with wild-type HIV-1 and subsequent selection of resistant virus by persistent exposure to long-acting PrEP.
