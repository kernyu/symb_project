Our objective was to assess junior doctors' perceptions of their antibiotic prescribing practice and of bacterial resistance. We surveyed 190 postgraduate doctors still in training at two university teaching hospitals, in Nice (France) and Dundee (Scotland, UK), and 139 of them (73%) responded to the survey. The main results presented in this abstract are combined for Nice and Dundee, because there was no statistical difference for these points between the two hospitals. Antibiotic resistance was perceived as a national problem by 95% of the junior doctors, but only 63% rated the problem as important in their own daily practice. Their perceptions of the causes of antibiotic resistance were sometimes at variance with available medical evidence, with excessive duration of antibiotic treatment and poor hand hygiene practices rarely being perceived as important drivers for resistance. Only 31% and 26% of the doctors knew the correct prevalences of antibiotic misuse and of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in hospitals, respectively. They preferred educational interventions, such as specific teaching sessions, availability of guidelines or readily accessible advice from an infectious diseases specialist, to improve antibiotic prescribing, rather than restricted prescription of antibiotics. These data provide helpful information for the design of strategies to optimize adherence to good antimicrobial stewardship.
