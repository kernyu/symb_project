OBJECTIVES: To document fosfomycin susceptibility of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-EC), analyse trends in fosfomycin use and investigate fosfomycin resistance in ESBL-EC isolated from urinary tract infections (UTIs). METHODS: Twenty-seven Spanish hospitals participating in the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network were requested to collect up to 10 sequential ESBL-EC for centralized susceptibility testing and typing. EUCAST guidelines were followed for antibiotic susceptibility testing, and bla(ESBL) type, phylogroups and O25b serotype were determined by PCR and sequencing. In addition, the trend in fosfomycin resistance among ESBL-EC causing UTIs was determined in 9 of the 27 hospitals. Total fosfomycin use for ambulatory care was established by WHO-recommended methods. RESULTS: A total of 231 ESBL-EC (42.4% CTX-M-15, 34.2% SHV-12 and 23.4% CTX-M-14) were collected. The overall rate of fosfomycin resistance was 9.1%, but varied according to ESBL type (5.6% of CTX-M-14 isolates, 5.1% of SHV-12 and 15.3% of CTX-M-15). Of 67 O25b/B2 isolates, 11 (16.4%) were fosfomycin resistant. Predictors of infection with fosfomycin-resistant ESBL-EC were O25b/phylogroup B2 isolates, female gender and nursing home residence. Among 114 197 UTIs caused by E. coli 4740 (4.2%) were due to ESBL-EC. Fosfomycin resistance increased in these isolates from 4.4% (2005) to 11.4% (2009). The use of fosfomycin grew from 0.05 defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants per day (1997) to 0.22 (2008), a 340% increase. CONCLUSIONS: Key factors related to increased fosfomycin resistance in ESBL-EC causing UTIs could be the rapid growth in community use of fosfomycin, the widespread distribution of the 025b/B2 E. coli clone and the existence of a susceptible population comprising women residing in nursing home facilities.
