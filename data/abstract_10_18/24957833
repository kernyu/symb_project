We compared the efficacies of daptomycin (doses equivalent to 8 to 10 mg/kg of body weight/day in humans) and cloxacillin alone with those of cloxacillin-rifampin and cloxacillin-daptomycin combinations, using a tissue cage methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) infection model. Monotherapies were less effective than combinations (P<0.05), and daptomycin resistance emerged. Cloxacillin-daptomycin proved as effective as cloxacillin-rifampin and prevented the appearance of resistance; this combination may be an alternative anti-MSSA therapy, which may offer greater benefits in the early treatment of prosthetic joint infections (PJI).
