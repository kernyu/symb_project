An efficient synthetic route to 1,5-disubstituted 2-aminoimidazoles from readily available amino acids and aldehydes has been developed. A library of simple analogues was synthesized and several compounds were shown to exhibit notable antibiotic activity against a variety of bacterial strains including multi-drug resistant isolates.
