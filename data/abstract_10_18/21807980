Clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to carbapenems are being isolated with increasing frequency. Loss of the expression of the major nonspecific porins OmpK35/36 is a frequent feature in these isolates. In this study, we looked for porins that could compensate for the loss of the major porins in carbapenem-resistant organisms. Comparison of the outer membrane proteins from two K. pneumoniae clinical isogenic isolates that are susceptible (KpCS-1) and resistant (KpCR-1) to carbapenems revealed the absence of OmpK35/36 and the presence of a new 26-kDa protein in the resistant isolate. An identical result was obtained when another pair of isogenic isolates that are homoresistant (Kpn-3) and heteroresistant (Kpn-17) to carbapenems were compared. Mass spectrometry and DNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that this new protein, designated OmpK26, is a small monomeric oligogalacturonate-specific porin that belongs to the KdgM family of porins. Insertion-duplication mutagenesis of the OmpK26 coding gene, yjhA, in the carbapenem-resistant, porin-deficient isolate KpCR-1 caused the expression of OmpK36 and the reversion to the carbapenem-susceptible phenotype, suggesting that OmpK26 is indispensable for KpCR-1 to lose OmpK36 and become resistant to these antibiotics. Moreover, loss of the major porin and expression of OmpK26 reduced in vitro fitness and attenuated virulence in a murine model of acute systemic infection. Altogether, these results indicate that expression of the oligogalacturonate-specific porin OmpK26 compensates for the absence of OmpK35/36 and allows carbapenem resistance in K. pneumoniae but cannot restore the fitness of the microorganism.
