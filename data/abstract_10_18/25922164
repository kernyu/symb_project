In 2013 the first case of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis was observed in Denmark. A 40-year-old male immigrant had previously been treated with several different antibiotics in his native country Russia. Because of earlier imprisonment in Russia and the fear of reincarceration he did not fully inform the Danish authorities about his disease and treatment. Therefore, he was initially treated with first-line drugs. Once the whole truth emerged and the result of the resistance test was available he was admitted to a highly specialized unit for further treatment.
