Lascufloxacin exhibited a broad spectrum of activity against various clinical isolates. Furthermore, lascufloxacin showed the most potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria among the quinolones tested and incomplete cross-resistance against existing quinolone-resistant strains. Enzymatic analysis indicated that lascufloxacin had potent inhibitory activity against both wild-type and mutated target enzymes. These results suggest that lascufloxacin may be useful in treating infections caused by various pathogens, including quinolone-resistant strains.
