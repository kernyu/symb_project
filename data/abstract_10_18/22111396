Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality compared to drug-sensitive disease. Although MDR-TB is infrequent in Ireland, cases continue to be diagnosed in both Irish and foreign-born people. We conducted a clinical audit of 13 MDR-TB patients treated in two tertiary referral centers, the Mercy Hospital, Cork and St James's Hospital, Dublin between 2004 and 2009. The median age was 37 years. Eight patients (61.5%) were foreign-born, five (38.5%) were Irish-born. Seven patients (54%) have now stopped treatment; 6 (86%) were treated successfully and one (14%) defaulted. Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were resistant to a median of seven drugs. Eight patients (61.5%) developed ototoxicity from long-term aminoglycoside use. Our patients' treatment outcomes compare favourably with international reports despite a high degree of drug resistance. However, the high incidence of otoxicity is concerning.
