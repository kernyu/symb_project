Public Health England recommends patient-held cards for those colonized with carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE). Alert cards were provided to 104 CPE-positive inpatients, with follow-up at six months. Excluding those who died, the response rate was 39%. Sixteen patients (46%) recalled receiving the card; 13 (81%) of these retained it, most (64%) of whom reported using it. This is the first evaluation of a patient-held alert card for any antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria in the UK. This study demonstrated that, when retained, CPE alert cards can be an effective communication tool. Further work is required to evaluate effectiveness and improve retention.
