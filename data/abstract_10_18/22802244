Despite great effort by health organizations worldwide in fighting tuberculosis (TB), morbidity and mortality are not declining as expected. One of the reasons is related to the evolutionary development of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, in particular the Beijing genotype strains. In a previous study, we showed the association between the Beijing genotype and an increased mutation frequency for rifampin resistance. In this study, we use a Beijing genotype strain and an East-African/Indian genotype strain to investigate with our mouse TB model whether the higher mutation frequency observed in a Beijing genotype strain is associated with treatment failure particularly during noncompliance therapy. Both genotype strains showed high virulence in comparison to that of M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv, resulting in a highly progressive infection with a rapid lethal outcome in untreated mice. Compliance treatment was effective without relapse of TB irrespective of the infecting strain, showing similar decreases in the mycobacterial load in infected organs and similar histopathological changes. Noncompliance treatment, simulated by a reduced duration and dosing frequency, resulted in a relapse of infection. Relapse rates were correlated with the level of noncompliance and were identical for Beijing infection and East African/Indian infection. However, only in Beijing-infected mice, isoniazid-resistant mutants were selected at the highest level of noncompliance. This is in line with the substantial selection of isoniazid-resistant mutants in vitro in a wide isoniazid concentration window observed for the Beijing strain and not for the EAI strain. These results suggest that genotype diversity of M. tuberculosis may be involved in emergence of resistance and indicates that genotype-tailor-made treatment should be investigated.
