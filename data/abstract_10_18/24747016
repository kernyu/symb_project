Chicken interferon-gamma (ChIFN-gamma) is both an inhibitor of viral replication and a regulator of numerous immunological functions. However, since little is known about the mechanisms underlying the insect-resistance of transgenic ChIFN-gamma, a transgenic ChIFN-gamma tobacco line was employed in the present study to explore this mechanism. A cDNA microarray (with 43,760 unigenes) was used to analyze the gene expression profiles of transgenic and wild-type (WT) tobacco leaves at two different growth stages. Compared with the WT, 1529 and 405 expressed sequence tags were significantly up- or downregulated on days 119 and 147, respectively. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are involved in metabolic regulation, cell division and differentiation, material synthesis and transport, signal transduction, and protein synthesis and degradation. Candidate genes that may increase cell density, thicken cell walls, promote secondary metabolite synthesis, and mediate plant hormone-induced resistance responses were used to identify the ChIFN-gamma-mediated insect-resistance mechanisms. The insect-resistance of transgenic ChIFN-gamma tobacco possibly involves unknown signaling pathways, which may directly or indirectly affect DEG expression-mediating genes. The degree of pest resistance increased as the plants grew. Three genes likely to be related to jasmonic acid- or salicylic acid-dependent plant defense responses, including CAF 1, Cop 8/CSN, and HD, are implicated in the insect-resistance of the transgenic plants. The mechanism of transgenic ChIFN-gamma tobacco resistance also involves RPS20 and other genes that induce microRNA-based gene regulation. The ChIFN-gamma-mediated DGEs contribute to insect-resistance in transgenic ChIFN-gamma tobacco, which provides new insight into the role of ChIFN-gamma.
