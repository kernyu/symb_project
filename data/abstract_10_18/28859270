Twelve nucleotides located at the 3' end of viral genomic RNA (vRNA) are conserved among influenza A viruses (IAV) and have a promoter function. Hoffmann's 8-plasmid reverse genetics vector system introduced mutations at position 4, C nucleotide (C4) to U nucleotide (U4), of the 3' ends of neuraminidase (NA) and matrix (M) vRNAs of wild-type A/PR/8/34 (PR8). This resulted in a constellation of C4 and U4 vRNAs coding for low (polymerases) and relatively high (all others) copy number proteins, respectively. U4 has been reported to increase promoter activity in comparison to C4, but the constellation effect on the replication efficiency and pathogenicity of reverse genetics PR8 (rgPR8) has not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we generated 3 recombinant viruses with C4 in the NA and/or M vRNAs and rgPR8 by using reverse genetics and compared their pathobiological traits. The mutant viruses showed lower replication efficiency than rgPR8 due to the low transcription levels of NA and/or M genes. Furthermore, C4 in the NA and/or M vRNAs induced lower PR8 virus pathogenicity in BALB/c mice. The results suggest that the constellation of C4 and U4 among vRNAs may be one of the multigenic determinants of IAV pathogenicity.
