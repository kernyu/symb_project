PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The 2009 influenza pandemic introduced a new influenza A/H1N1 subtype in the human population. This pandemic 2009 influenza A/H1N1 virus has natural resistance to the adamantanes class and has a low threshold to become resistant to the neuraminidase class of antiviral drugs. This review describes recent findings on influenza antiviral resistance in pandemic 2009 influenza A/H1N1 virus. RECENT FINDINGS: Pandemic 2009 viruses have emerged with novel resistance patterns to the neuraminidase inhibitors. In addition, the identification of mutations that facilitated oseltamivir resistance in prepandemic influenza emphasizes the ability of influenza to become resistant to antiviral drugs without significant loss of fitness. SUMMARY: Novel initiatives are required to find and develop high genetic barrier influenza therapeutic regimens for effective treatment of severe influenza virus infections.
