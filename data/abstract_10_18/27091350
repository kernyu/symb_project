Gastric MALT lymphoma is closely associated with Helicobacter pylori infection. Bacterial eradication therapy comprising clarithromycin is the first-line treatment in gastric MALT lymphoma patients. However, antimicrobial resistance to clarithromycin has been increasing in Europe, and thus far, it has not been examined in gastric MALT lymphoma patients. Based upon histopathological investigation, 17 adult gastric MALT lymphoma patients were identified to be related with H. pylori infection between 1997 and 2014. Detection of H. pylori infection in these patients and clarithromycin susceptibility testing were performed by 23S rRNA gene real-time PCR. Twelve of the patients were confirmed with H. pylori infection by real-time PCR. Among these patients, only two were found to be infected with clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori strain. In one of them, both the clarithromycin-resistant and sensitive genotype were detected. The rate of clarithromycin resistance was 15.4 %. Clarithromycin resistance pattern in gastric MALT lymphoma patients is under the predictions since a previous study performed in Central Europe revealed a rate of 36.6 % in Austria. Considering the low antimicrobial resistance rate, clarithromycin is still an option in gastric MALT lymphoma management.
