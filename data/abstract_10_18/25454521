The effect of three PSII-inhibiting herbicides, lenacil, linuron, and pyrazon, on the accumulation of 5-n-alkylresorcinols in rye seedlings (Secale cereale L.) grown under various light and thermal conditions was studied. All used chemicals increased resorcinolic lipid content in both green and etiolated plants grown at 29 degrees C. At 22 degrees C pyrazon and lenacil decreased the content of alkylresorcinols in plants kept in the darkness and increased their amount in the light-grown seedlings. In turn, level of resorcinolic lipids was decreased by linuron in both etiolated and green plants. At the lowest tested temperature lenacil enhanced production of alkylresorcinols only in etiolated rye seedlings, whereas the light-independent stimulatory action of pyrazon on alkylresorcinol accumulation in rye grown at 15 degrees C was observed. Additionally, only the latter did not exert a negative effect on rye seedling growth under any of tested conditions. Compared with respective controls, the herbicides used also markedly modified the qualitative pattern of resorcinolic homologs. Interestingly, the observed changes generally favored the enhanced antifungal activity of these compounds. Our study provides novel information on the influence of PSII inhibitors on alkylresorcinol metabolism in rye seedlings. The unquestionable achievement of this work is the observation that low dose of pyrazon mainly stimulated both growth and alkylresorcinol synthesis in rye seedlings, a non-target plant. Moreover, our experimental work showed unambiguously that the observed pyrazon-driven accumulation and homolog pattern modification of alkylresorcinols dramatically improved the resistance of winter rye to infections caused by Rhizoctonia cerealis.
