Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) have emerged as a major threat. Commonly used antibiotics are generally inactive against CRE. Therefore, timely detection of CRE is of paramount importance. Among CRE, those producing carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase enzymes (carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae) are particularly of concern because they tend to spread, and treatment is difficult. The carbapenemase groups most commonly encountered include KPC, NDM, and OXA-48. Treatment options are limited and include combinations of polymyxins, tigecycline, aminoglycosides, or carbapenems; newer agents with activity against CRE and better safety profiles are becoming available and will likely emerge as the preferred therapy.
