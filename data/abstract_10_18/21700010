The IL-12-inducing ability of lactic acid bacteria could be a critical index of immunomodulatory activity, especially in promoting T-helper-1 responses and in suppressing T-helper-2-mediated allergic responses. We aimed to develop a simple method for enhancing the IL-12-inducing ability of bacteria. We examined the in vitro effects of strains of lysozyme-modified Lactococcus (ML-LYS), prepared by heat treatment of the Lactococcus strain in the presence of lysozyme, on the ability of mouse macrophage-like J774.1 cells and spleen cells to produce IL-12. An IL-12-inducing ability greater than that of heat-killed bacteria was shown by 41 of 46 ML-LYS strains in J774.1 cells and by all 46 ML-LYS strains in mouse spleen cells. In contrast, bacteria modified by alpha-lactalbumin, beta-lactoglobulin, or ovalbumin did not enhance IL-12 production in J774.1 cells. Microscopically, ML-LYS showed stronger resistance to lysozyme and macrophage digestion than did heat-killed bacteria or the other modified bacteria. Addition of chitotriose, a lysozyme inhibitor, enhanced IL-12 production by J774.1 cells stimulated with heat-killed bacteria. Therefore, enhancement of resistance to lysozyme may be a key factor in the strong IL-12-inducing ability of ML-LYS. These findings have important implications for the design of dairy products that have an immunomodulatory effect using the modified bacteria.
