OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the complete genome sequence of multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus sciuri strain SNUDS-18 isolated from a farmed duck in South Korea. METHODS: Genomic DNA was sequenced using a PacBio RS II system. The obtained genome was annotated and antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes were identified. RESULTS: The sequenced genome possessed a mecA homologue (mecA1) that was almost identical to that of other oxacillin-susceptible S. sciuri strains, whereas the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) was not detected. Moreover, various antimicrobial resistance genes conferring resistance to beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, phenicols, tetracycline and macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLSB) antimicrobials were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The SNUDS-18 genome and its associated genomic data will provide important insights into the biodiversity of the S. sciuri group as well as valuable information for the control of this potential pathogen.
