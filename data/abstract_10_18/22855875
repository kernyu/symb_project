Surveillance and feedback of results to clinical teams is central to performance improvement in managing healthcare-acquired infections. A major role of the Advisory Committee on Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare-Associated Infections (ARHAI) is to advise on surveillance priorities. A sub-committee was set up to systematically review existing UK surveillance schemes. The following three systems were examined in detail: mandatory reporting of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteraemia and Clostridium difficile infection to the HPA; surveillance of surgical site infection undertaken by the HPA; and surgical site infection surveillance undertaken at University College London Hospital. Recommendations included the extension of mandatory reporting to include bacteraemia due to Escherichia coli and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), post-discharge surveillance of surgical site infection, the need for validation of surveillance systems and mandatory reporting of Caesarean section wound infections. Mandatory reporting of bacteraemia due to E. coli and MSSA were introduced during 2011 and further extension of surveillance is likely.
