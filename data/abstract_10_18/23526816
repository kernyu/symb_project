Despite the fact that pathogenic infections are widely treated by antibiotics in the clinic nowadays, the increasing risk of multidrug-resistance associated with abuse of antibiotics is becoming a major concern in global public health. The increased death toll caused by pathogenic bacterial infection calls for effective antibiotic alternatives. Lysozyme-coated mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs subsetLys) are reported as antibacterial agents that exhibit efficient antibacterial activity both in vitro and in vivo with low cytotoxicity and negligible hemolytic side effect. The Lys corona provides multivalent interaction between MSNs subsetLys and bacterial walls and consequently raises the local concentration of Lys on the surface of cell walls, which promotes hydrolysis of peptidoglycans and increases membrane-perturbation abilities. The minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) of MSNs subsetLys is fivefold lower than that of free Lys in vitro. The antibacterial efficacy of MSNs subsetLys is evaluated in vivo by using an intestine-infected mouse model. Experimental results indicate that the number of bacteria surviving in the colon is three orders of magnitude lower than in the untreated group. These natural antibacterial enzyme-modified nanoparticles open up a new avenue for design and synthesis of next-generation antibacterial agents as alternatives to antibiotics.
