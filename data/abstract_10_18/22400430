The therapy of the chronically hepatitis C virus infection is still a major challenge for the attending physician. Standard therapy regimen implements the combination of pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin. Duration of therapy is individualized according to the infecting HCV genotype and on the viral response. However, only in 50-80% (dependent on the HCV genotype) treatment will be successful. The development of so called "direct-acting antivirals"(DAA) will provide new options and this was achieved by the approval of two inhibitors of the HCV protease. Boceprevir and telaprevir give hope especially for patients infected with the worse to treat HCV genotype 1. In order to reduce the risk of antiviral resistance these drugs are given in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin only.
