The strains of lactic acid bacteria have been isolated from the intestine of older women. These strains were identified and their biological activity was studied. It has been established that Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. plantarum, L. salivarius var. salivarius and Enterococcus faecium had the highest antagonistic activity against opportunistic microorganisms. It has been revealed, that the adhesive properties and antibiotic resistance of the tested cultures had strain specificity. Most of the isolates were highly adhesive and did not produce hemolysins.
