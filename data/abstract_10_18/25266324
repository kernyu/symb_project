The present study was undertaken to detect Pneumocystis jirovecii infection among HIV-positive patients presenting with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection and analyze the associated dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) mutations. P. jirovecii infection was detected in 12.6% cases. We did not find DHPS gene mutations at the commonest positions of codon 55 and 57; however, mutation at codon 171 was detected in two cases. No mutations in DHFR gene were detected. The results indicate low prevalence of DHPS and DHFR mutations in Indian P. jirovecii isolates, suggesting that the selective pressure of sulfa drugs on the local strains has probably not reached the levels found in developed nations.
