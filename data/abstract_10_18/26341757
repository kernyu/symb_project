BACKGROUND: Little is known about the epidemiology of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) bacteriuria following kidney transplantation. We determined the incidence of post-transplant CRKP bacteriuria in adults who underwent kidney transplant from 2007 to 2010 at 2 New York City centers. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study to identify factors associated with CRKP bacteriuria compared with carbapenem-susceptible K. pneumoniae (CSKP) bacteriuria, assessed whether CRKP bacteriuria was associated with mortality or graft failure, and compared outcomes of treated episodes of CRKP and CSKP bacteriuria. RESULTS: Of 1852 transplants, 20 (1.1%) patients developed CRKP bacteriuria. Factors associated with CRKP bacteriuria included receipt of multiple organs (odds ratio [OR] 4.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-20.4), deceased-donor allograft (OR 5.9, 95% CI 1.3-26.8), transplant admission length of stay (OR 1.1 per day, 95% CI 1.0-1.1), pre-transplant CRKP infection or colonization (OR 18.3, 95% CI 2.0-170.5), diabetes mellitus (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.0-7.8), and receipt of antimicrobials other than trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (OR 4.3, 95% CI 1.6-11.2). CONCLUSION: Compared to CSKP bacteriuria, CRKP bacteriuria was associated with increased mortality (30% vs. 10%, P = 0.03) but not graft failure. Treated episodes of CRKP bacteriuria were less likely to achieve microbiologic clearance (83% vs. 97%; P = 0.05) and more likely to recur within 3 months (50% vs. 22%, P = 0.02) than CSKP episodes. CRKP bacteriuria after kidney transplant is associated with mortality and antimicrobial failure after treatment.
