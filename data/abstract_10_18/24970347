Cadmium is a highly toxic metal whose presence in the environment represents a challenge for all forms of life. To improve our knowledge on cadmium toxicity, we have explored Salmonella Typhimurium responses to this metal. We have found that cadmium induces the concomitant expression of the cation efflux pump ZntA and of the high affinity zinc import system ZnuABC. This observation suggests that cadmium accumulation within the cell induces a condition of apparent zinc starvation, possibly due to the ability of this metal to compete with zinc for the metal binding site of proteins. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that strains lacking ZntA or ZnuABC are hyper-susceptible to cadmium and that the cadmium-induced growth defect of a znuABC mutant strain is largely relieved by zinc supplementation. A similar growth defect was observed for a mutant with impaired ability to acquire iron, whereas cadmium does not affect growth of a strain defective in manganese import. Cadmium also influences the expression and activity of the two cytoplasmic superoxide dismutases FeSOD and MnSOD, which are required to control cadmium-mediate oxidative stress. Exposure to cadmium causes a reduction of FeSOD activity in Salmonella wild type and the complete abrogation of its expression in the strain defective in iron import. In contrast, although MnSOD intracellular levels increase in response to cadmium, we observed discrepancies between protein levels and enzymatic activity which are suggestive of incorporation of non-catalytic metals in the active site or to cadmium-mediated inhibition of manganese import. Our results indicate that cadmium interferes with the ability of cells to manage transition metals and highlight the close interconnections between the homeostatic mechanisms regulating the intracellular levels of different metals.
