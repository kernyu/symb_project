BACKGROUND: The study sought evidence for changes in the proportions of antibiotic resistant strains among isolates of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. typhi) and Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi (S. paratyphi) between 2005 and 2012. METHODS: Blood culture isolates of S. typhi and S. paratyphi from patients attending Newham and The Royal London Hospitals were included in the study. The organisms were cultured on selective media and identified by Maldi-ToF, API 20E and serology. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of augmentin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin and azithromycin were determined by E tests for 194 isolates. RESULTS: Median MICs of ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone were stable at 0.5 mg/L and 0.125 mg/L, respectively. Chloramphenicol, azithromycin, co-trimoxazole and augmentin median MICs were 4 mg/L, 8 mg/L, 0.064 mg/L and 0.5 mg/L, respectively. MIC90 values were lower than the resistant breakpoint for ceftriaxone, azithromycin and augmentin, but were >256 mg/L for chloramphenicol, 32 mg/L for co-trimoxazole and 1 mg/L for ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic resistance remained stable for enteric fever isolates between 2005 and 2012. The isolates remained susceptible to augmentin, ceftriaxone and azithromycin over this period, but the MIC90 was greater than the resistant breakpoint for chloramphenicol, cotrimoxazole and ciprofloxacin. The implications for clinical practice are that isolates of S. typhi and S. paratyphi from East London remain sensitive to ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
