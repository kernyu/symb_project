The SmeDEF pump of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is negatively regulated by SmeT. In this study, strains KJDeltaT (smeT deletion mutant) and KJT-D(m) (mutant with a defective SmeT-binding site) showed increased resistance to chloramphenicol/nalidixic acid/macrolides and susceptibility to aminoglycoside. Overexpression of the SmeDEF pump, in either KJDeltaT or KJT-D(m), downregulated smeYZ expression, which is responsible for the reduced aminoglycoside resistance. Furthermore, the SmeRySy two-component regulatory system was downregulated in response to SmeDEF overexpression, which supports its involvement in the regulatory circuit.
