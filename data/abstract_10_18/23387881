We are entering a post-antibiotic era in medicine, as resistance to commonly used antibiotics rises and the discovery of successful new classes of antibiotics slows. New therapeutic targets are being identified and investigated, including approaches that may overcome resistance, interrupt bacterial communication, and enhance human immune function. Immune function is negatively affected by type B malnutrition (multiple micronutrient depletion), "pathological hygiene" (removal of innate immune primers such as yeasts from the food chain), the removal of innate primers such as yeasts from the food chain, HIV infection, diabetes, chronic stress and depressive illness, and the use of immunosuppressant medications. These and other forms of innate immune dysfunction can be overcome / compensated for by novel therapeutic tools which enhance or mimic different aspects of innate immune function, and which re-configure and reinforce Claude Bernard's milieu interieur.
