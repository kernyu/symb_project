We report a case of an immunocompromised patient affected by chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) with high basal HBV viremia (>8 log(10) IU/ml) who failed an entecavir regimen, despite the absence of primary or secondary drug resistance mutations. The patient achieved sustained virological success (serum HBV DNA <12 IU/ml) when tenofovir was added to the treatment. This case highlights the difficulty in choosing an optimal therapy in such specific conditions and supports the concept of tailoring therapy (including combination regimens) on the basis of the particular conditions of each individual patient.
