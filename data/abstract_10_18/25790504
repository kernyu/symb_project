Klebsiella pneumoniae is one of the Gram-negative bacilli most commonly found in urine of pregnant women and causing neonatal sepsis. The aim of this study was to analyse in terms of epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance of 23 K. pneumoniae isolates collected from vaginal swabs or urine of pregnant women, from pharyngeal and ear swabs of apparently healthy newborns and from peripheral cultures and hemocultures of newborns with suspected invasive neonatal infection in Rabat, Morocco. The prevalence of K. pneumoniae was 0.6 and 0.9% among pregnant women and neonates, respectively. These strains showed lower antimicrobial resistance levels regarding the developed countries. Thus, only one strain from a neonate presented an ESBL. This is the first report of a K. pneumoniae strain causing neonatal sepsis harbouring the blaCTX-M-15 gene in an IncFII plasmid and belonging to ST466 in this area.
