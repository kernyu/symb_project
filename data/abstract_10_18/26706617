Naturally occurring resistance-associated variants (RAVs) within the protease domain of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype (G) 1a separated into clades 1 and 2, and G1b were investigated in 59 HIV/HCV coinfected patients. RAVs were detected in 10/23 G1a/clade 1 and 1/19 G1b (p 0.0059). A similar frequency of RAVs was found when comparing G1a/clade 2 and G1b (p 0.1672). A cross-resistance to the macrocyclic compounds simeprevir and paritaprevir was detected in two G1a/clade 2 and 1 G1b sequences and none of G1a/clade 1 sequences. The simultaneous characterization of subtype and natural RAVs by population analysis of the NS3 domain by may add important information for anti-HCV treatment strategies including protease inhibitors.
