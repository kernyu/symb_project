Here, we report the description of a colistin-heteroresistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate fortuitously isolated from the stool sample of a patient with suspicion of tuberculosis in a public hospital of Marseille, France. In the colistin-resistant subpopulation, a mutation in the mgrB gene leading to a premature stop codon was found, and the hypermucoviscous phenotype was lost. Susceptibility to other antibiotics remained unchanged. To our knowledge, this is the first identification of such a colistin-heteroresistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate in France.
