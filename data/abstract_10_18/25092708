Tigecycline nonsusceptibility is concerning because tigecycline is increasingly relied upon to treat carbapenem- or colistin-resistant organisms. In Enterobacteriaceae, tigecycline nonsusceptibility is mediated by the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump, among others, and pump activity is often a downstream effect of mutations in their transcriptional regulators, cognate repressor genes, or noncoding regions, as demonstrated in Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter isolates. Here, we report the emergence of tigecycline nonsusceptibility in a longitudinal series of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates collected during tigecycline therapy and the elucidation of its resistance mechanisms. Clinical isolates were recovered prior to and during tigecycline therapy of a 2.5-month-old Honduran neonate. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests to tigecycline determined that the MIC increased from 1 to 4 mug/ml prior to the completion of tigecycline therapy. Unlike other studies, we did not find increased expression of ramA, ramR, oqxA, acrB, marA, or rarA genes by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). Whole-genome sequencing revealed an IS5 insertion element in nonsusceptible isolates 85 bp upstream of a putative efflux pump operon, here named kpgABC, previously unknown to be involved in resistance. Introduction of the kpgABC genes in a non-kpgABC background increased the MIC of tigecycline 4-fold and is independent of a functional AcrAB-TolC pump. This is the first report to propose a function for kpgABC and identify an insertion element whose presence correlated with the in vivo development of tigecycline nonsusceptibility in K. pneumoniae.
