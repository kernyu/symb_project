Significance of symbiotic relations formed by associative symbiosis type for autochthonous and allochthonous microflora of natural water bodies is shown. Generality of symbiotic interaction mechanisms of symbionts in limnetic and halophilous communities provided by secreted factors of natural resistance from the side of the host, and by factors of persistence from the side of symbionts is proven based on a set of examples. Features of operation of lysozyme-antilysozyme, histon-antihiston, hydrogen peroxide-catalase functional systems in symbiotic interactions of autotrophic and heterotrophic components of hydrobiocenosis with dominant and associative microflora are presented. Associative microflora of allochthonous origin was shown to actively use the ecologically formed system of interaction between hydrobionts that facilitates survival of these microorganisms and preservation of their persistent potential, and as a result leads to biocenosis disorders. The knowledge obtained open new possibilities and perspectives of research of sanitary and ecological aspects of vital activity of aquatic biocenoses.
