BACKGROUND: Blood stream infections (BSIs) remain as a serious life-threatening condition after solid organ transplant (SOT). In recent years, a progressive growth in the incidence of bacteremia caused by non-lactose fermenting gram-negative bacilli (NLF GNB) has been observed. NLF GNB led to high mortality among SOT recipients with bacteremia and were difficult to treat because of their high drug resistance to commonly used antibiotics. METHODS: Two electronic databases, PUBMED and EMBASE, were searched for relevant literature published up to January 2015, to better understand the characteristics of bacteremia because of NLF GNB. RESULTS: The morbidity and mortality rates of bacteremia because of NLF GNB depend on the types of organisms and transplantation. Multi-drug resistant NLF GNB ranged from 9.8% to 12.5% of all NLF GNB causing BSIs among SOT recipients. Certain factors can predispose SOT recipients to NLF GNB bacteremia, which included previous transplantation, hospital-acquired BSIs, and prior intensive care unit admission. Combination therapy may be beneficial in the treatment of NLF GNB bacteremia to enhance antimicrobial activity, provide synergistic interactions, relieve side effects, and minimize superinfections. CONCLUSIONS: Prevention is pivotal in minimizing the morbidity and mortality associated with NLF GNB bacteremia after SOT. To improve the outcomes of SOT recipients with NLF GNB bacteremia, prevention is pivotal, and combination therapy of antibiotics may be beneficial.
