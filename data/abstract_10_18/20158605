AIMS: Yersinia enterocolitica 4/O:3 isolates of slaughter pigs originating from different farms were characterized to study the distribution of different genotypes at farm. A correlation between the genotypes and the resistance patterns was also examined. METHODS AND RESULTS: Hundred and eighty-seven ail-positive Y. enterocolitica 4/O:3 isolates recovered from pigs originating from 31 Bavarian farms in 2000, 2003 and 2004 were characterized. PFGE using NotI, ApaI and XhoI enzymes revealed 31 genotypes. The most common genotype was found in 13% of the pigs. From most farms (71%), only one genotype was found. Some genotypes were found during different years. Low resistance was noted to streptomycin (9%), sulphamethoxazole (9%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (5%) and tetracycline (1%) by agar disc diffusion method. CONCLUSIONS: Several genotypes were found. Some genotypes were widely distributed and persisted for years. Farm-specific genotypes may exist. No clear relation between the genotypes and antimicrobial patterns was found. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study provides data on the genetic diversity of Bavarian pig strains and antimicrobial resistance. It may be of interest for other countries where Y. enterocolitica strains are genotyped to get more information about the strain distribution of this pathogen.
