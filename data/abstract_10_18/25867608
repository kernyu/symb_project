BACKGROUND AND AIMS: This study aimed to validate the equivalence of first-line concomitant and hybrid regimens for Helicobacter pylori infection in an era of increasing antibiotic resistance. The study also aimed to assess regimen compliance. METHODS: H. pylori-infected patients from six hospitals in Korea were randomly assigned to either concomitant or hybrid regimens. The concomitant regimen consisted of 20 mg of esomeprazole, 1 g of amoxicillin, 500 mg of clarithromycin, and 500 mg metronidazole, twice daily for 10 days. The hybrid regimen consisted of a 5-day dual therapy (20 mg of esomeprazole and 1 g of amoxicillin, twice daily) followed by a 5-day quadruple therapy (20 mg of esomeprazole, 1 g of amoxicillin, 500 mg of clarithromycin, and 500 mg of metronidazole, twice daily). RESULTS: Eradication rates for concomitant and hybrid therapy were 78.6% (187/238) and 78.8% (190/241) in the intention-to-treat analysis, and 89.8% (176/196) and 89.6% (181/202) in the per protocol analysis. For both analyses, 95% confidence intervals fell within the +/- 8% equivalence margin. Adherence was better in the hybrid group (95.0%) than in the concomitant group (90.1%), a difference that was borderline significant (P = 0.051). Adverse event rates were higher in the concomitant group than in the hybrid group for nausea (15.8% vs 8.8%; P = 0.028) and regurgitation (17.6% vs 10.7%; P = 0.040). CONCLUSION: As compared with concomitant therapy, hybrid therapy offered similar efficacy, better compliance, and fewer adverse events. Hybrid therapy could be a reasonable first-line treatment option for H. pylori in areas with high antibiotics resistance.
