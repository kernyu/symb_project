Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease that degrades the local defense mechanisms of the lower respiratory tract. As a result, patients develop recurrent infections that progressively deteriorates antiinfection defenses and represent the major cause of mortality. A hallmark of those infections is the diversity of microorganisms isolated from broncho-alveolar lavage or sputum. The clinical significance of isolates is different, the recognition of the role in altering of respiratory function being important in guiding antibiotic therapy. Current data support pathogenicity in CF of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and B. cepacia complex, the latter two being considered "preterminal bacteria". S. aureus was the most common cause of mortality and morbidity in preantibiotic era. Today, life expectancy was improved with the introduction of antistaphylococcal antibiotics. Hypermutation of P. aeruginosa--the most common species isolated from patients with CF, is the essential factor in the development of multi-resistance to antibiotics. As P. aeruginosa, B. cenocepacia is a virulent species that cause infections with poor prognosis. Microorganisms with secondary role (H. influenzae, S. maltophilia, atypical Mycobacteria, Aspergillus spp) whose clinical significance has not been clarified yet, require further studies.
