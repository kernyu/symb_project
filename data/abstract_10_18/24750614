Nanohybrids of layered double hydroxide (LDH) with intercalated active molecules: benzoate, 2,4-dichlorobenzoate, para-hydroxybenzoate and ortho-hydroxybenzoate, were incorporated into pectins from apples through high energy ball milling in the presence of water. Cast films were obtained and analysed. X-ray diffraction analysis showed a complete destructuration of all nanohybrids in the pectin matrix. Thermogravimetric analysis showed a better thermal resistance of pectin in the presence of fillers, especially para-hydroxybenzoate and ortho-hydroxybenzoate. Mechanical properties showed an improvement of elastic modulus in particular for LDH-para-hydroxybenzoate nanohybrid, due probably to a better interaction between pectin matrix and nanohybrid layers. Barrier properties (sorption and diffusion) to water vapour showed improvement in the dependence on the intercalated active molecule, the best improvement was achieved for composites containing para-hydroxybenzoate molecules, suggesting that the interaction between the filler phase and the polymer plays an important role in sorption and diffusion phenomena. Incorporation of these active molecules gave antimicrobial properties to the composite films giving opportunities in the field of active packaging.
