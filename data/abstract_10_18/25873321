As antibiotics act to inhibit the growth of bacteria, the drugs are useful for treating bacterial infectious diseases.

In this review, the fruit of our group's current research on self-protection mechanisms of Streptomyces producing antibiotics that inhibit DNA, protein and bacterial cell wall syntheses will be described.
