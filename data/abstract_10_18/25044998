High-level resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is due to expression of penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a), a transpeptidase that catalyzes cell-wall crosslinking in the face of the challenge by beta-lactam antibiotics. The activity of this protein is regulated by allostery at a site 60 A distant from the active site, where crosslinking of cell wall takes place. This review discusses the state of knowledge on this important enzyme of cell-wall biosynthesis in MRSA.
