The foreseen decline in antibiotic effectiveness explains the needs for data to inform the global public health agenda about the magnitude and evolution of antibiotic resistance as a serious threat to human health and development. Opportunistic bacterial pathogens are the cause of the majority of community and hospital-acquired infections worldwide. We provide an inventory of pre-existing regional surveillance programs in the six WHO regions which should form the underpinning for the consolidation of a global network infrastructure and we outline the structural components such as an international network of reference laboratories that need to be put in place to address the void of these crucial data. In addition we suggest to make use of existing Health and Demographic Surveillance Sites (HDSS) to obtain crucial information from communities in resource limited settings at household level in low- and middle-income countries in Asia and Africa. For optimising the use of surveillance data for public health action i.e. priority setting for new drug development, comparative quantification of antibiotic effectiveness at local, national, regional and global level and identification of the action gaps can be helpful.
