Chryseobacterium spp are widely distributed in nature but data of their isolation from clinical samples is scanty. Here, we report the first case of AmpC producing C. gleum causing pyonephrosis in a patient having bilateral nephrolithiasis on double J (DJ) stent. The present isolate was resistant to vancomycin, erythromycin, clindamycin, carbapenems and ciprofloxacin and susceptible to tetracycline and minocycline. The patient was treated with tetracycline and recovered without the need for removal of the DJ stent. The environmental surveillance carried out to trace the nosocomial origin of the isolate was negative. Since antimicrobial susceptibility of this isolate is different from previous reports, we emphasise that in vitro susceptibility testing should be sought to choose optimal antimicrobial agents for these Nonfermentative Gram-Negative Bacilli (NFGNBs) with different susceptibility patterns.
