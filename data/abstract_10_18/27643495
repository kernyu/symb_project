Treatment of infectious diseases is complex and success is dependent upon a number of factors. The proper prescription and correct dosage of antimicrobials are important elements in this respect. Incorrect prescription and insufficient dosage can result not only in treatment failure but also contribute to the development of antimicrobial resistance. In order to achieve correct antibiotic dosages it is necessary to gain insight in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles. It is also vital to differentiate among various types of infections and to adjust antibiotic prescription to the clinical situation of the individual patient accordingly. To further optimise antibiotic policy collaboration between dental and medical professions is of major importance.
