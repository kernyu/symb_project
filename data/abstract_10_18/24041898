We report the epidemiological impact of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) in Spain in 2012. Of the 237 carbapenemases detected, 163 were from the OXA-48 group, 60 were from VIM-1, 8 were from KPC-2, 5 were from IMP, and 1 was from NDM-1. Interhospital spread of carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae was due to a limited number of multilocus sequence types (MLST) and carbapenemase types, including ST15-VIM-1, ST11-OXA-48, ST405-OXA-48, ST101-KPC-2, and ST11-VIM-1. The number of CPE cases in Spain has increased sharply in recent years, due mainly to the emergence of OXA-48.
