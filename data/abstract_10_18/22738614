BACKGROUND: Some molecular features of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates causing invasive infections have been shown to have clinical implications. There is a need to monitor the situation using a combination of molecular and clinical data because, although MRSA clones tend to predominate over wide geographical areas, clonal shifts may take place. AIM: To study the epidemiological features and perform molecular characterization of a retrospective cohort of 98 cases of nosocomial and healthcare-associated MRSA bacteraemia in 10 hospitals in Andalusia, Spain. METHODS: Relatedness of isolates was investigated using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), S. aureus protein A (spa) typing and clonal complex (CC) assignment. Staphylococcal chromosomal cassette mec (SCCmec) type and accessory gene regulator (agr) group were studied by polymerase chain reaction. agr function was assessed. RESULTS: Most isolates were CC5, SCCmec type IV and agr group II. The most common spa type was t067. Six major clusters were identified by PFGE. Six small clusters of epidemiologically related cases sharing isolates from the same PFGE subtype were identified. Five percent of isolates had a vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2 mug/mL on broth microdilution, although 44% had an MIC >1 mug/mL on E-test. Variables independently associated with MIC >1 mg/L on E-test were surgery during present admission and Charlson index >/=2. CONCLUSION: A specific CC that has been predominant in Spain over the last decade caused most of the cases in this study. PFGE was more discriminatory than spa typing in showing clusters of epidemiologically related cases. Some patient features were associated with vancomycin MIC >1 mg/L on E-test.
