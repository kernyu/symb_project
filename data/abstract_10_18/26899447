Anaerobiospirillum succiniciproducens is a rare but potentially lethal pathogen. We report a case of A. succiniciproducens bloodstream infection in a 55-year-old man hospitalized for pelvic trauma. The strain was identified by 16sRNA sequencing after several failures of identification by MALDI-TOF MS. The strain was susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics and ciprofloxacin, but resistant to macrolides and clindamycin. Identification tools must be improved to enhance our knowledge on this rare pathogen and to define optimal therapy.
