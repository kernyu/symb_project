In the present study, we sought to investigate the long-term effects of nonylphenol (NP) on insulin signaling and glucose metabolism in liver. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species (ROS) in liver was evaluated as it is known to induce insulin resistance. Rats were administered NP by oral gavage at the doses of 15, 150 and 1500 mug/ kg body weight per day for 45 days. Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) generation and lipid peroxidation were increased, and the activities of antioxidant enzymes were decreased in the liver of NP-treated rats. NP increased the plasma glucose and insulin levels and altered the enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism. Decrease in the protein levels of insulin signaling molecules insulin receptor (IR), IR substrate (IRS)-1, IRS-2 and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase were observed with parallel increase in H(2)O(2) levels in the liver of NP-treated rats. These results suggest that NP downregulates insulin signaling in liver, which could be due to ROS production and oxidative damage.
