We describe the clinical outcome of 17 patients with secondary Acinetobacter bacteremia whose isolates had a tigecycline MIC of </=2 mg/liter and who received tigecycline within 2 days of bacteremia onset. The 14-day mortality rate of the tigecycline cohort was 41.2% (7/17), which was significantly higher than that of those receiving other appropriate antimicrobial agents (13.8%, 9/65; P = 0.018). However, the percentages of end-stage renal disease and congestive heart failure were higher in the tigecycline cohort. The efficacy of tigecycline was contingent upon the illness severity and bacterial species. Tigecycline should be applied cautiously for treatment of Acinetobacter bacteremia.
