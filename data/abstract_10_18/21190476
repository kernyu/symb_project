This study was conducted to identify the beta-lactamase content of 30 metallo-beta-lactamase-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated in 2007 from two Tunisian hospitals and to investigate their genetic relatedness. All these isolates produced VIM-2. bla(PER-1), bla(PSE-1), bla(OXA-2), and bla(OXA-10) were identified in 17, 5, 21, and 1 isolates, respectively. These enzymes were often associated in the same isolate: 26 isolates had at least two beta-lactamases. The predominant serotype was O12. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed genetic diversity among the metallo-beta-lactamase-producing P. aeruginosa isolates. This is the first report on the existence of bla(PER-1), bla(PSE-1), bla(OXA-2), and bla(OXA-10) in Tunisia.
