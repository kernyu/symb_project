The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) TerrestrialAnimal Health Code considers the prudent use of antimicrobial agents in veterinary medicine to comprise a series of practical measures and recommendations which confer benefits to animal and public health while preserving and maintaining the therapeutic efficacy of antimicrobials. This paper reviews some of the main veterinary prudent use guidelines which have been published in English and the responsibilities of those involved at all levels in the administration of antimicrobials to animals, including national regulatory authorities. The OIE guidelines are considered comprehensive and cover all of those levels, from regulatory authorities to veterinarians and food producers. Guidelines produced by national authorities, professional veterinary associations or farming associations and which are targeted at particular individuals, for example veterinarians or food animal producers, will, obviously, restrict their coverage to those aspects considered relevant for their target audience.
