Entry control of Arabidopsis thaliana against non-adapted powdery mildews largely depends on the PEN1 secretion pathway and the PEN2-PEN3 antifungal metabolite pathway, and is critical for non-host resistance. In a recent study, we reported that ENHANCED DISEASE RESISTANCE 1 (EDR1) plays a role in entry control against a non-adapted anthracnose fungus, which exhibits an infection style distinct from that of powdery mildews. Results obtained using edr1 pen2 double mutants indicate that the contribution of EDR1 to non-host resistance is independent of that of the PEN2-mediated defence pathway. Comparative transcript profiling revealed that EDR1 is critical for expression of four plant defensin genes. The MYC2-encoded transcription factor represses defensin expression. Inactivation of MYC fully restored defensin expression in edr1 mutants, implying that EDR1 cancels MYC2 function to regulate defensin expression. These findings indicate that EDR1 exerts a critical role in non-host resistance, in part by inducing antifungal peptide expression via interference in MYC2-mediated repressor function.
