The aim of the study was to determine the genotype of 15 ESBL strains of Enterobacteriaceae resistant to beta-lactams, isolated from inanimate surfaces and phenotypically characterized as producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. After evaluation and screening of the bacterial strains, a PCR was conducted to amplify fragments of 1078 bp and 544 bp corresponding to type TEM and CTX-M ESBL. Eleven strains presented both fragments at the time and only three had blaCTX-M. In conclusion, the presence of ESBL genes in cultures from the environment was demonstrated, some of which may belong to more than one type. This information could serve as a basis for implementing preventive measures to prevent the transmission of multiresistant bacteria from inanimate surfaces to patients, mainly in critical hospital areas.
