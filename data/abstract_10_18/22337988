A patient with systemic cytomegalovirus (CMV), including chorioretinitis, received localized and systemic ganciclovir, systemic cidofovir analog, and localized foscarnet. Mutations conferring ganciclovir and cidofovir resistance were detected in CMV from the aqueous fluid but not in CMV from plasma. Quantifying CMV from aqueous fluid was valuable for monitoring the clinical response and predicting resistance.
