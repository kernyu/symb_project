Isochrysis galbana and Isochrysis sp. are economically important microalgae from the division of haptophytes. Here, we report Agrobacterium-mediated stable DNA transfer into their nuclear genomes. Initial studies were performed to standardize co-cultivation media and determine the sensitivity of the microalgae to selective agents. Up to 1 mg/ml of the antibiotic hygromycin did not inhibit growth, whereas both the haptophytes bleached in artificial seawater (ASW) medium containing micromolar concentrations of the herbicide norflurazon. Co-cultivation of Isochrysis sp. and I. galbana with Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA 4404 harboring the binary vector pCAMBIA 1380-pds-L504R yielded norflurazon-resistant (NR) colonies visible on selective plates after 20-30 days. pCAMBIA 1380-pds-L540R was constructed by cloning a mutated genomic phytoene desaturase (pds) gene from Haematococcus pluvialis as a selectable marker gene into the binary vector system pCAMBIA 1380. Co-cultivation of Isochrysis sp. with A. tumefaciens in ASW medium containing 200 muM of acetosyringone for 72 h produced the highest number of NR cells. For I. galbana, 100 muM of acetosyringone, ASW medium, and 48 h co-cultivation period appeared to be optimum co-cultivation parameters. The NR colonies kept their resistance phenotype for at least 24 months, even in the absence of selective pressure. The transfer of the pds gene in NR cells was shown by PCR amplification of the T-DNA sequences from the genomic DNA of NR cells and Southern blot analysis using T-DNA sequences as probes. The genetic manipulation described here will allow metabolic engineering and a better understanding of several biochemical pathways in the future.
