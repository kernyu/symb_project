The aim of this study was to determine antibiotic susceptibility of Propionibacterium acnes isolates from prostate. Prostate-derived P. acnes isolates (n = 24, Umea & Orebro, Sweden, 2007-2010) and a panel of control strains (n = 25, Sweden) collected from skin and deep infections were assessed for resistance to penicillin G, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, gentamicin, azithromycin, erythromycin, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, tetracycline, tigecycline, fusidic acid, clindamycin, rifampicin, linezolid, daptomycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and metronidazole. In addition, the isolates were tested for inducible clindamycin resistance. All prostate derived P. acnes isolates displayed wild-type distribution of MIC-values, without evidence of acquired resistance. In the reference panel, 5 of 25 isolates had acquired macrolide resistance with cross-resistance to azithromycin, clindamycin, and erythromycin. In addition, one of these isolates was resistant to tetracycline.
