Flavonoids are a subdivision of polyphenols, a versatile class of natural compounds that represent secondary metabolites from higher plants and are abundant in human diet. Various protective effects of flavonoids have been reported, including antimicrobial and antifungal activities. Due to the nature of oral candidiasis and the increased use of antifungal agents, several drug-resistant strains have emerged making it impractical to rely on one standard therapeutic regime. The aim of this review is to summarize the antifungal activity of some examples of the major subclasses of flavonoids in pure extract forms against C. albicans in vitro, as reported in literature over the past 10 years (2004-2015). In addition, this review outlines the potential mechanism of actions of flavonoids studied in vitro, which may contribute to a better understanding of flavonoids as multi-targets agents in the treatment and/or prevention of oral candidiasis in clinical settings.
