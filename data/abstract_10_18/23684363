BACKGROUND: Cerebrovascular endothelial cells (CECs), major component cells of the blood-brain barrier, can be injured by oxidative stress. Propofol can protect cells from oxidative injury. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of propofol on nitrosative stress-induced insults to CECs and its possible mechanisms. METHODS: Primary CECs isolated from mouse cerebral capillaries were exposed to2 nitric oxide (NO) donors: sodium nitroprusside (SNP) or S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO). Cellular NO levels, cell morphologies, and cell viabilities were analyzed. DNA fragmentation and apoptotic cells were quantified using flow cytometry. Proapoptotic Bcl2-antagonist-killer (Bak) and cytochrome c were immunodetected. Bak translocation was analyzed using confocal microscopy. Caspases-9 and -3 activities were measured fluorometrically. Permeability of the CEC monolayer was assayed by measuring the transendothelial electrical resistance. RESULTS: Exposure of CECs to SNP increased cellular NO levels and simultaneously decreased cell viability (P < .01). Meanwhile, treatment of CECs with propofol at a therapeutic concentration (50 muM) decreased SNP-induced cell death (P < .01). SNP induced DNA fragmentation and cell apoptosis, but propofol decreased the cell injury (P < .01). Sequentially, propofol decreased SNP-enhanced Bak levels and translocation from the cytoplasm to mitochondria (P < .05). Exposure of CECs to propofol attenuated GSNO-induced cell death, apoptosis, and caspase-3 activation (P < .01). Additionally, propofol protected CECs against SNP-induced disruption of the CEC monolayer (P < .05). Consequently, SNP-enhanced cascade activation of caspases-9 and -3 was decreased by propofol (P < .01). CONCLUSION: This study suggested that propofol at a therapeutic concentration can protect against nitrosative stress-induced apoptosis of CECs due to downregulation of the intrinsic Bak-mitochondrion-cytochrome c-caspase protease pathway.
