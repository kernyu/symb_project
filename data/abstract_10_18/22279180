Fluoroquinolone resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis has become increasingly important. A review of mutations in DNA gyrase, the fluoroquinolone target, is needed to improve the molecular detection of resistance. We performed a systematic review of studies reporting mutations in DNA gyrase genes in clinical M. tuberculosis isolates. From 42 studies that met inclusion criteria, 1220 fluoroquinolone-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates underwent sequencing of the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) of gyrA; 780 (64%) had mutations. The QRDR of gyrB was sequenced in 534 resistant isolates; 17 (3%) had mutations. Mutations at gyrA codons 90, 91 or 94 were present in 654/1220 (54%) resistant isolates. Four different GyrB numbering systems were reported, resulting in mutation location discrepancies. We propose a consensus numbering system. Most fluoroquinolone-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates had mutations in DNA gyrase, but a substantial proportion did not. The proposed consensus numbering system can improve molecular detection of resistance and identification of novel mutations.
