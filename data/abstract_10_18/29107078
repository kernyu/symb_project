BACKGROUND: Mupirocin is used specifically for the eradication of nasal meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), but increasing mupirocin resistance restricts its repeated use. The antibacterial effects of manuka honey have been established in vitro; antibacterial activity of other honeys has also been reported. AIM: To describe the learning experience from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the efficacy of medical-grade honey (MGH) with mupirocin 2% for the eradication of nasal MRSA. METHODS: Patients colonized in the nose with MRSA and age >/=18 years were recruited. Participants received either one or two courses of MGH or mupirocin 2%, three times per day for five consecutive days. FINDINGS: The proportion of patients who were decolonized after one or two courses of treatment was not significantly different between MGH [18/42; 42.8%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 27.7-59.0] and mupirocin 2% (25/44; 56.8%; 95% CI: 41.0-71.7). Non-nasal MRSA colonization was significantly associated with persistent nasal colonization (odds ratio: 5.186; 95% CI: 1.736-5.489; P = 0.003). The rate of new acquisition of mupirocin resistance was 9.75%. CONCLUSION: Although not significant, a decolonization rate of 42.8% for MGH was impressive. Our findings suggest that this strategy, which has the potential to combat antimicrobial resistance, should be assessed in similar but larger studies.
