In this study, we describe the genetic features of an XDR KPC-2-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate by using whole-genome sequencing, its clinical-epidemiological context and susceptibility against antimicrobial combinations. The isolate belongs to clonal complex 258 and harbors several acquired genes and mutations associated with antimicrobial resistance.
