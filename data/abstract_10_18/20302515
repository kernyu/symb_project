Moenomycins are phosphoglycolipid antibiotics and the only known natural product inhibitors of peptidoglycan glycosytransferases (PGTs). Techniques that would allow facile diversification of the moenomycin structure would facilitate the development of novel antibiotics, which are urgently needed in the wake of multidrug resistant bacterial infections. The cloning and initial characterization of the moenomycin biosynthetic genes has already redefined the minimal moenomycin pharmacophore and now opens the door for the biocombinatorial generation of bioactive moenomycin fragments. Here, we highlight the importance of research on the genetic mechanisms that regulate moenomycin biosynthesis and that confer moenomycin resistance to bacteria in the development of novel anti-infectives based on PGT inhibition.
