This is a report on the synergistic interactions (SIs) between melampolide-type sesquiterpene lactones 1-8 from Acanthospermum hispidum DC., and oxacillin or gentamicin, against four pathogenic strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis; two of them were multi-resistant strains obtained from chronic infectious processes. Our results showed that all associations of 1-8 with antibiotics (ATBs) are more effective than pure ATBs to control pathogenic strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis. The most relevant SIs were observed when the major lactone of A. hispidum, acanthospermal B [5], was combined with gentamicin (protein synthesis inhibitor) against an ex vivo culture of methicillin-resistant S. aureus SAR 1, displaying a significant MIC reduction in 5 (312.5 to 78.1 microg/mL), and gentamicin (120 microg/mL to 3 microg/mL). Compound 4 improved the antibiotic potency of oxacillin (cell wall synthesis inhibitor) against ampicillin-resistant E. faecalis (60 microg/mL to 1.5 microg/mL). It is important to remark that three beneficial lactobacilli were resistant to 1-8 and their mixtures with gentamicin or oxacillin in effective concentrations against pathogenic bacteria. Synergism between ATBs and phytochemicals is a therapeutically helpful concept to improve ATB efficacy and prevent resistance. The present results show that selective SIs occur between melampolides and gentamicin or oxacillin, and open a new field of research.
