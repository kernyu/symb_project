The present study was carried out to assess the frequency of methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRS) among racehorses (n=209) and veterinary personnel (n=13) as well as environmental surfaces (n=14) at an equine hospital in Adana, Turkey. In addition, species distribution, antimicrobial susceptibility, resistance genes, staphylococcal chromosomal cassette mec (SCCmec) type and clonality of these isolates were also investigated. MRS were identified by 16S rRNA sequencing, and typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). As a result, MRS was isolated in horses (48.3%), clinic staff (92.3%) and environmental samples (71.4%). Of the 123 MRS isolates, 118 isolates were identified as Staphylococcus lentus, and the remaining ones were found to be S. sciuri (n=3), S. intermedius (n=1) and S. fleuretti (n=1). All isolates were found to be susceptible against vancomycin, quinupristin-dalfopristin and rifampicin. Additionally, single or various combinations of resistance genes were detected among MRS isolates. SCCmec type II was identified in all isolates. Similar PFGE patterns were observed among MRS isolated from horses, humans, and environmental samples. Since MRS were concurrently isolated from horses and humans it is suggested that cross-transmission of MRS between horses and humans might occur. However, it cannot be ruled out that transmission is human to animal or animal to human.
