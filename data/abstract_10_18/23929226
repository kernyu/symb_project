We report the first outbreak of carbapenem-resistant NDM-1-producing Acinetobacter baumannii in Europe, in a French intensive-care unit in January to May 2013. The index patient was transferred from Algeria and led to the infection/colonisation of five additional patients. Concurrently, another imported case from Algeria was identified. The seven isolates were genetically indistinguishable, belonging to ST85. The bla(NDM-1) carbapenemase gene was part of the chromosomally located composite transposon Tn125. This report underscores the growing concern about the spread of NDM-1-producing A. baumannii in Europe.
