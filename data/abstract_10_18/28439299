BACKGROUND: Enterococcus faecalis, generally considered as a saprophytic bowel commensal, has recently emerged as an important nosocomial pathogen causing severe urinary tract infections, surgical wound infections, bacteremia, and bacterial endocarditis. This bacterium is capable of forming biofilms on various surfaces and its high level of antibiotic resistance contributes to its pathogenicity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect on E. faecalis, of Substance P (SP), an antimicrobial peptide that is produced in the gut and skin. RESULTS: We found that SP did not have antibacterial activity against E. faecalis V583 (MIC >1000 microg/ml). Conversely, SP stimulated aggregation, hydrophobicity, lactic acid and tyramine production in this bacterium. The cytotoxicity and bacterial translocation were also accelerated when E. faecalis V583 were pretreated with SP before infection of intestinal Caco-2/TC7 cells. CONCLUSION: SP can modulate the physiology of E. faecalis. Extensive studies are now needed to screen within the human microbiota which bacteria are responsive to host molecules, and to identify their sensors.
