The analysis of A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 influenza viruses collected between 2005 and 2008 in Cambodia detected strains resistant to oseltamivir and confirmed widespread resistance to adamantanes. Phylogenetic analyses revealed intrasubtype reassortment, probable reemergence of A/H3N2 viruses in two consecutive seasons, and cocirculation of different lineages in each subtype.
