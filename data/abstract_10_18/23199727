Linezolid is an important agent for the treatment of infections because of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). This study identified independent predictors for isolation of linezolid-resistant VRE (LZD-R-VRE) and analyzed outcomes associated with linezolid resistance. Immunosuppression, prior surgery, and previous exposure to beta-lactam antibiotics were independent predictors for isolation of LZD-R-VRE but not for LZD-susceptible-VRE. Prior exposure to linezolid was not a predictor for isolation of LZD-R-VRE.
