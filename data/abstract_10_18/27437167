In recent years the misuse of antimicrobials has contributed to the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance. Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs (ASP) decrease the misuse of antimicrobials by supporting a rational, systematic approach. ASP strategies vary from broad-ranging policies and other decision support tools to prospective audit review of patients on antimicrobials. Many healthcare facilities, however, have been slow to adopt stewardship attributable to the fact that early ASP models required individuals with specialized training, and a significant amount of time and infrastructural investment from facilities. In response to the increasing need for ASPs in Hawai'i, the Hawai'i Department of Health (HDOH) partnered with the Daniel K. Inouye College of Pharmacy (DKICP) to develop the Hawai'i Antimicrobial Stewardship Collaborative (HASC), a voluntary collaboration whose main objective is to assist hospital institutions in the implementation of a simplified model of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Core Elements of Hospital Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs. The work of HASC places Hawai'i's health care institutions in an advantageous position to be able to comply with impending accreditation standards relating to antibiotics and infections.
