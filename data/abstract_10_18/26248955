BACKGROUND & AIMS: Thrombocytopaenia and hypoalbuminaemia are surrogate markers for portal hypertension and hepatic synthetic dysfunction respectively. Patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) with these surrogates have reduced likelihood of sustained virologic response and increased risk for hepatic decompensation or death when treated with peginterferon/ribavirin plus either telaprevir or boceprevir. METHODS: We conducted a post-hoc analysis of the TURQUOISE-II clinical trial in patients with cirrhosis to examine the impact of these surrogates on efficacy and safety of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir with ribavirin. RESULTS: Of 380 genotype 1-infected patients in TURQUOISE-II, 104 had either a platelet count <100 x 10(9)/L or albumin <3.5 g/dl. Sustained virologic response rates were 89 and 97% in patients with thrombocytopaenia, and 84 and 89% in patients with hypoalbuminaemia after 12 and 24 weeks of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir with ribavirin respectively. These rates were similar to those observed in the overall study population (92 and 97% for 12 and 24 weeks). HCV genotype 1a-infected patients with thrombocytopaenia or hypoalbuminaemia had higher response rates when treated for 24 weeks, whereas only 1 of 35 genotype 1b patients did not achieve a sustained virologic response. Adverse event rates and discontinuations because of adverse events were low. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of these analyses support the use of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir with ribavirin in these subpopulations with cirrhosis. Genotype 1a-infected patients with indicators of portal hypertension may benefit from a 24-week treatment duration.
