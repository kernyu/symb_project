BACKGROUND: Strong acid inhibition using esomeprazole increases cure rates with triple therapy and 10-day treatments are more effective than 7-day ones. The combination of amoxicillin plus metronidazole at full doses, and using a physiologically-correct schedule three times a day, and has been shown to overcome metronidazole resistance and to achieve good eradication rates. AIMS: To assess the eradication rate of a new first-line treatment regimen associating strong acid inhibition, amoxicillin and metronidazole and to evaluate tolerance. METHODS: Patients from eight hospitals were included. Helicobacter pylori status was assessed by at least one of the following: histology, culture, rapid urease test or urea breath test (UBT). Ten-day treatment was prescribed comprising esomeprazole 40 mg twice a day plus amoxicillin 1 g and metronidazol 500 mg both three times a day. Helicobacter pylori cure was assessed by UBT. RESULTS: A hundred and thirty-six patients were enrolled. Mean age was 52.6 +/- 16 years and 59.6% of patients were men. Main indications for treatment were: uninvestigated dyspepsia (13.6%); functional dyspepsia (18.2%); gastric ulcer (21.8%); and duodenal ulcer (39.8%). Helicobacter pylori eradication was achieved in 112 of the 127 patients who returned for follow-up. Eradication rates were 82.4% (95% CI: 74.7-88.1) by intention-to-treat analysis and 88.2% (95% CI: 81.2-92.8) by per protocol. Treatment was well tolerated and no major side effects were reported. Nine patients complained of mild side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Cure rates of the combination of esomeprazole, amoxicillin and metronidazole are high and the treatment was well tolerated. This pilot study warrants the comparison of this schedule with current standards.
