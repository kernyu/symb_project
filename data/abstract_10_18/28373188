This study surveyed the prevalence of mcr-1 in extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli strains of food origin in China and identified strains that carried mcr-1, fosA3, and ESBL genes, which were carried in various plasmids. The mcr-1 and ESBL genes could be cotransferred by one or more types of plasmids. The presence of these multidrug-resistant E. coli strains in food products might pose a huge threat to public health.
