France is one of main countries affected by the HIV-outbreak in Europe with more than 120,000 cases, among which 34,600 patients having developed an AIDS. The antiretroviral combination therapies (combined antiretroviral therapy [cART]) reduced by half the mortality. A low compliance to cART alters the virologic control and increases the morbimortality. If required, the therapeutic break should be the shortest possible, including the whole treatment (to limit the risk of viral resistance). The perioperative care should take into account the underlying conditions. During the preoperative period, the clinical picture could combine various complications: 1: respiratory impairment; 2: impairment of neuronal functions (related to viral factors, host response and environmental factors such as alcohol, drug addiction, HCV co-infection) inducing a cognitive dysfunction or a peripheral neuropathy; 3: lipodystrophy, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance are the main metabolic cART-related side effects, responsible for atherosclerosis and coronaropathy; 4: major nutritional impairment. Anesthesia for HIV patients is almost the same than usual, without HIV-related contraindication to regional anesthesia. Anesthetic drugs can be associated to cART. The main restriction belongs to the protease inhibitors, which could affect the metabolic pathways of opioids, NSAIDs and benzodiazepines (over dosage risks). During the postoperative period, the follow-up should include the thromboembolism prevention (increased risk compared to main people), the cardiovascular side effects, the nutritional status and the continuation of the treatment. Moreover, the psychological status related and a close collaboration with the corresponding physician is critical.
