From 2005 to 2009, at Detroit Medical Center, the prevalence of Providencia stuartii increased from 0.52 to 0.91/1000 patient-days (p<0.001). The use of colistin also increased (p<0.001) during the study period. The increase in the prevalence of P. stuartii was associated with an increased use of colistin (p<0.001). Facilities that frequently use colistin and tigecycline should closely monitor the prevalence of P. stuartii along with other Proteeae, since these organisms are intrinsically resistant to colistin and tigecycline.
