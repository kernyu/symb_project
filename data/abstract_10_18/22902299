We have sequenced the complete R6K-based and mobilizable suicide vector pJP5603. For the replication of the vector a trans supply of the pir-encoded pi protein of plasmid R6K is essential. The 3.126 kb plasmid encodes a kanamycin resistance cassette for selection and contains a lacZ-alpha-system that allows a blue-white selection of cloned fragments.
