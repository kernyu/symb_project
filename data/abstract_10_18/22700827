Antibiotic resistance among gram-negative bacteria has reached critical levels. The rise of carbapenem resistance in Enterobacteriaceae carrying additional resistance genes to multiple antibiotic classes has created a generation of organisms nearly resistant to all available therapy. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) infections are known to be associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and these pathogens have now made their way to the most vulnerable populations, including children. This review provides a brief overview of CRE, with a focus on CRE infections in children, and highlights available data on the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, carbapenemase types, risk factors, treatment, and outcomes of these multi-drug resistant infections in the pediatric population.
