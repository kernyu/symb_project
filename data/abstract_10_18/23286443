BM2 channel plays an important role in the replication of influenza virus B. However, few studies attempt to investigate the mechanism of the proton conductance in BM2 channel, as well as the drug resistance of the BM2 channel. The first experimental structure of the BM2 protein channel has recently been solved, enabling us to theoretically study BM2 systems with different protonation states of histidine. By performing molecular dynamics simulations on the BM2 systems with different protonation states of four His19 residues, we provided our understanding of the structure, dynamics, and drug resistance of the BM2 channel. In general, the results of our study and other investigations both have demonstrated that whether the BM2 channel adopts an open or a closed form depends on the protonation state of His19. Meanwhile, we discovered that a drug (amantadine) was unable to enter into the center of the BM2 channel even at a low pH condition probably due to the number of hydrophilic residues of the BM2 channel. Finally, potentials of mean force (PMF) calculations were performed for the drug binding BM2 channel, energetically explaining why the BM2 channel exhibited drug resistance to two inhibitors of the AM2 channel, amantadine and rimantadine.
