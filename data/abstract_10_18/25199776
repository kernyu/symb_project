Invasive infections caused by filamentous fungi are a major threat for immunocompromised patients. Innate/acquired resistance to antifungal drugs might necessitate combination therapies. We assessed the potential combination of voriconazole with miltefosine, an original drug with antifungal activity against 33 clinically relevant mold isolates, including both azole-susceptible and -resistant Aspergillus. Using complete inhibition as an endpoint, interactions were indifferent for 32/33 isolates. An alternative 50% inhibition endpoint showed synergistic interactions for 14/33 isolates. Antagonism was absent.
