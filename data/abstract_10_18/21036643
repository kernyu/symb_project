An 18-month-old neutered male domestic shorthair cat, domiciled in the southwest of France, was first presented having suffered for a few days from dysorexia and vomiting. Abdominal palpation revealed lymph node enlargement. Cytological examinations of a fine needle aspirate demonstrated granulomatous inflammation with many non-staining elements consistent with mycobacteria. Diagnosis was confirmed by culture and polymerase chain reaction and Mycobacterium avium subspecies was isolated. Treatment was initiated with marbofloxacin, rifampicin and cefoxitin. There was a rapid clinical improvement. The cat suddenly died 2 months later. The main hypothesis is the administration of an inappropriate combination therapy that leads to the development of mycobacterial resistance. A volvulus and acute peritonitis secondary to the significant enlargement of a mesenteric lymph node were present at necropsy. Histopathological analysis of mesenteric lymph node, liver and spleen revealed multicentric granulomatous and severely necrotic lesions with numerous Ziehl-Neelsen positive intracytoplasmic elements.
