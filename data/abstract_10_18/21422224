The biocidal activity of peracetic acid (PAA) and benzalkonium chloride (BAC) on Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms was investigated by using a recently developed confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) method that enables the direct and real-time visualization of cell inactivation within the structure. This technique is based on monitoring the loss of fluorescence that corresponds to the leakage of a fluorophore out of cells due to membrane permeabilization by the biocides. Although this approach has previously been used with success with various Gram-positive species, it is not directly applicable to the visualization of Gram-negative strains such as P. aeruginosa, particularly because of limitations regarding fluorescence staining. After adapting the staining procedure to P. aeruginosa, the action of PAA and BAC on the biofilm formed by strain ATCC 15442 was investigated. The results revealed specific inactivation patterns as a function of the mode of action of the biocides. While PAA treatment triggered a uniform loss of fluorescence in the structure, the action of BAC was first localized at the periphery of cell clusters and then gradually spread throughout the biofilm. Visualization of the action of BAC in biofilms formed by three clinical isolates then confirmed the presence of a delay in penetration, showing that diffusion-reaction limitations could provide a major explanation for the resistance of P. aeruginosa biofilms to this biocide. Biochemical analysis suggested a key role for extracellular matrix characteristics in these processes.
