BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Urinary tract infections (UTI) are one of the most common infectious diseases with different microbial agent and antimicrobial resistant pattern in hospitalized patients and outpatients. In order to assess the adequacy of therapy, knowledge of prevalence and resistance pattern of the bacteria is necessary. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and the antimicrobial resistance pattern of main bacterial responsible for UTI in order to establish an appropriate empirical therapy. METHODS: All urine samples were referred to Imam Hospital Laboratory, Tehran, Iran during 2011-2012, urine culture isolated and bacteria were identified and the profile of antibiotic susceptibility was characterized. RESULT: From 1851 urine cultures, UTI was more frequent in woman (68%) E. coli was as usual the most common pathogen implicated in UTI. Most susceptibility was to imipenem (98.9%). nitroforantoin (96%) and amikacin (94.1%) and increased resistance to penicillin (66.6%), nalidixic acid (62.1%) ampicilin (60.1%) and cotrimoxazole 54.3%. DISCUSSION: The most common isolated pathogen was E. coli . According to antibiogram susceptibility, the recommended antimicrobial drugs are nitroforantoin and imipenem. nalidixic acid and cotrimoxazole are not recommended because drug resistance is high.
