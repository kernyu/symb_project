Decreased ciprofloxacin susceptibility (DCS) and multidrug resistance in typhoidal Salmonella isolates in areas of endemicity are significant therapeutic problems. Guidelines for azithromycin disc diffusion and MIC interpretive criteria for Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi were published recently by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute in 2015. We investigated the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of azithromycin in 100 isolates of Salmonella Typhi (n=80), Paratyphi A (n=18) and B (n=2) recovered from bloodstream infections from January 2013 to December 2015. Zone sizes were extrapolated against MIC values, and a scatter plot was constructed. The azithromycin MICs by Etest ranged from 2 to 16 microg ml-1, while the disc diffusion diameters were from 13 to 22 mm. We observed that the margin of the zone of inhibition around the azithromycin disc may not be very clear and therefore difficult to interpret and that there was wide variation in the zone sizes for the same MIC value in both serovars. DCS was observed in 85 % of Salmonella Typhi recovered (68/80) and in 15/18 (83.3 %) Paratyphi A isolates. Judicious use of azithromycin is advocated as an alternative oral agent in endemic areas where DCS is common.
