BACKGROUND/AIM: Virulent Pseudomonas aeruginosa. is frequently life-threatening and often challenging to treat, and the emergence of multidrug-resistant isolates presents a critical problem for patients. The aim of the study was concerned with molecular analysis of the virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance profile of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa (MDRPA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Out of 44 MDRPA isolates, 12 isolates representing different resistance profiles and sources of samples were selected for further molecular studies. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approaches were applied to identify the genes implicated in antimicrobial resistance or virulence factors in the selected MDRPA isolates. RESULTS: Multidrug-resistance (pstS), beta-lactamase (IMP7, IMP10, IMP13, and IMP25), and extended spectrum beta-lactamase (blaOXA50) genes were detected in all of the selected MDRPA isolates. However, only 4 (33%) MDRPA isolates were positive for the presence of the extended spectrum beta-lactamase (blaOXA2) gene. Furthermore, the hemolytic phospholipase C precursor gene (plcH) was detected in all PCR products of the tested MDRPA isolates while the exotoxin A (toxA) gene was absent. Other virulence genes were detected with variable percentage in tested isolates. CONCLUSION: The statistical analysis revealed a significantly positive correlation (r = 0.779, P = 0.002) between virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance marker profiles of the tested MDRPA isolates.
