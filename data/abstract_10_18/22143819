We describe a case of wound infection by multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus sciuri in a patient admitted to hospital for injuries in Agreste Alagoas, Brazil, identified through broad-spectrum PCR and sequencing of 16S rDNA gene. Due to its high resistance profile, the infection was characterized as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus presenting sensitive only to vancomycin and chloramphenicol. The injury resulting from trauma associated with infection resulted in amputation of the infected limb.
