This study investigates the prevalence of drug resistance and mutations in rpoB gene among Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from Kassala State, Sudan. In a cross-sectional study during 2011, sputum specimens (n = 90) were examined microscopically and grown cultures were identified by analysing IS6110 insertion sequence. Antimicrobial sensitivity and mutations in the rpoB gene were determined. Of the 90 specimens found which were positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB), 65 (72.2%) showed growth of mycobacteria. Sixty (66.7%) of these were M. tuberculosis, 5 (5.6%) were rapidly growing mycobacteria and 10 (11.1%) revealed no growth. Of the 60 M. tuberculosis, 31 (51.7%) were drug resistant, including 18 multidrug resistant TB (30%), and 15 (83.3%) demonstrated mutations in the rpoB gene. Isoniazid and rifampicin revealed the highest resistance rates (64.5%, 61.3%, respectively). In conclusion, drug resistance M. tuberculosis in Kassala State was high (30%) and was found to be mainly (83.3%) due to mutations in the rpoB gene.
