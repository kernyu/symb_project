Directed evolution of transcription factors can be employed to effectively improve the phenotypes which are controlled by multiple genetic loci. In this study, we used error-prone PCR for the directed evolution of SPT3, which is the component of yeast Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex responsible for the transcription of stress-related genes, and studied its effect on the improvement of ethanol tolerance. Mutant library was constructed by ligating the error-prone PCR products with a modified pYES2.0 plasmid, and the expression plasmids were subsequently transformed to yeast industrial strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae 4126. One mutant strain M25 showing superior growth in presence of 10% ethanol was selected. M25 produced 11.7% more ethanol than the control strain harboring the empty vector when 125 g/L glucose was used as substrate. This study revealed that SPT3 is an important transcription factor for the metabolic engineering of yeast ethanol tolerance.
