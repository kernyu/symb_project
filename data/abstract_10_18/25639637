INTRODUCTION: European guidelines on the treatment of Neisseria gonorrhoeae are based mostly on Western European data, although these recommendations may not be optimised for the circumstances in Hungary. AIM: The aim of the authors was to assess current antimicrobial resistance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains in order to enhance gonococcal antimicrobial surveillance in Hungary. Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains were isolated at the National Center of Sexually Transmitted Infections at the Department of Dermatology, Venerology and Dermatooncology of Semmelweis University in the period between January 2011 and June 2014. METHOD: Antimicrobial resistance was determined with minimum inhibitory concentration measurement. Neisseria gonorrhoeae Multiantigen Sequence typing was used as molecular typing method. RESULTS: Resistance to the currently recommended extended spectrum cephalosporins is rare in Hungary, but there is an emerging azithromycin resistance among the Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains. CONCLUSIONS: Revision of the national treatment guideline must consider that the most frequent sequence types of Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains causing infections in Hungary are mainly resistant to azithromycin.
