We report for the first time the isolation of CTX-M-15-producingEscherichia colistrains belonging to sequence type (ST) 410, ST224, and ST1284 in commercial swine in Brazil. TheblaCTX-M-15gene was located on F-::A9::B1 and C1::A9::B1 IncF-type plasmids, surrounded by a new genetic context comprising the IS26insertion sequence truncated with the ISEcp1element upstream ofblaCTX-M-15 These results reveal that commercial swine have become a new reservoir of CTX-M-15-producing bacteria in South America.
