We investigated the contribution of quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) mutations to fluoroquinolone (enrofloxacin, orbifloxacin and danofloxacin) susceptibility in 58 Mycoplasma bovis isolates from dairy cattle in Japan. Fluoroquinolone non-resistant isolates (fluoroquinolone-MICs</=2 mug/ml) possessed no QRDR mutations (19 isolates) or Ser83Leu in GyrA (32 isolates). Fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates (fluoroquinolone-MICs>/=4 mug/ml) possessed Ser83Leu in GyrA and Ser81Pro in ParC (3 isolates) or Ser83Phe in GyrA and Ser80Ile in ParC (4 isolates). Laboratory-derived fluoroquinolone-resistant mutants selected from 2 isolates (possessing Ser83Leu in GyrA) had an amino acid substitution in ParC at the same position (Ser80Ile or Ser81Tyr) as fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates, suggesting a concurrent amino acid substitution in ParC (Ser80 or Ser81) is important in fluoroquinolone resistance in M. bovis isolates.
