Interaction of the cationic surfactants benzalkonium chloride and 1-hexadecylpyridinium chloride, in the concentration range 0.1 microM to 1 mM with calf thymus DNA and with short 19-mer double-stranded DNA has been examined in solution using UV absorption and fluorescent spectroscopies and at the liquid-solution interface by thickness-shear mode acoustic wave sensor. Higher concentrations of surfactant resulted in an increase of UV absorption, and decrease of melting temperature and van't Hoff enthalpy of calf thymus DNA. Both surfactants induce fluorescence quenching of ethidium bromide which is also associated with intercalation of the molecules into the nucleic acid strand. The effect of the pyridinium compound is greater than for the other surfactant likely because of the lower size of polar head group in this molecule. With respect to acoustic wave detection at the device surface, for relatively low surfactant concentrations (below 100 microM), decreases of both series resonant frequency and motional resistance were observed. At higher surfactant concentration both parameters increased. These effects are attributed to acoustic coupling processes that occur at the device-film/liquid boundary.
