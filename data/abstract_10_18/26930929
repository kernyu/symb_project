OBJECTIVE: To understand the impact of niclosamide ethanolamine salt on the Yangtze River wetland creatures, so as to provide an evidence for the environmental impact assessment of the Oncomelania hupensis control measures. METHODS: Eriocheir sinensis, Procambarus clarkii, freshwater mysis and Bellamya aeruginosa were chosen as the test organisms from the lower reaches of the Yangtze River in Nanjing City, and they were immersed in the different concentrations of niclosamide ethanolamine salt solution for 24-96 h. The mortality rates and LC50 values were calculated. RESULTS: There was only 1 death (with a mortality rate of 8.33%) of P. clarkia immersed in niclosamide ethanolamine salt with the concentration of 400 mg/L for 96 h. There was no death of the E. sinensis immersed in niclosamide ethanolamine salt with the concentration of 640 mg/L for 96 h. The LC50 values were 2.170 4, 1.303 6, 1.013 1 mg/L and 0.720 5 mg/L respectively when the freshwater mysis were immersed in the solution for 24, 48, 72 h and 96 h. The LC50 values were 1.173 5, 0.642 1, 0.477 3 mg/L respectively when the B. aeruginosa were immersed in the solution for 24, 48, 72, 96 h. CONCLUSIONS: The impacts of niclosamide ethanolamine salt on the different wetland creatures are different. E. sinensis and P. clarkii have high resistance to niclosamide ethanolamine salt. However, niclosamide ethanolamine salt shows heavy toxicity on the freshwater mysis and Bellamya aeruginosa.
