BACKGROUND: Increasing globalisation, with the migration of people, animals and food across national borders increases the risk of the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. To avoid becoming a carrier of antibiotic-resistant bacteria when travelling, knowledge about antibiotic resistance is important. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We aimed to describe the knowledge and understanding of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and of the risk for becoming a carrier of such bacteria, among Swedish travellers before their travel to high-risk areas. A questionnaire with three open-ended questions was distributed to 100 individuals before departure. RESULTS: The travellers' answers were analysed using content analysis, resulting in the theme 'To be an insecure traveller who takes control over one's own journey'. Our results showed that the travellers were aware of what the term 'antimicrobial resistance' meant, but did not understand its real significance, nor the consequences for the individual nor for society. They also distanced themselves from the problem. Few thought that their travel would entail a risk of becoming a carrier of resistant bacteria. The lack of knowledge caused an uncertainty among the travellers, whom tried to master the situation by using coping strategies. They proposed a number of measures to prevent carriership. The measures were general and primarily aimed at avoiding illness abroad, particularly acute gastro-intestinal infection. CONCLUSIONS: In health care and vaccination clinics, there is a need for improved information for persons intending to travel to high-risk areas, both about the risks of contracting antibiotic-resistant bacteria and about effective preventive measures.
