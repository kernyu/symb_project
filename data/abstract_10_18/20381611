The worldwide emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria poses a serious threat to human health. In addition to the difficulties in controlling infectious diseases, the phenotype of resistance can generate metabolic changes which, in turn, can interfere with host-pathogen interactions. The aim of the present study was to identify changes in the subproteome of a laboratory-derived piperacillin/tazobactam-resistant strain of Escherichia coli (minimal inhibitory concentration [MIC] = 128 mg/L) as compared with its susceptible wild-type strain E. coli ATCC 25922 (MIC = 2 mg/L) using 2-D fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS). In the resistant strain, a total of 12 protein species were increased in abundance relative to the wild-type strain, including those related to bacterial virulence, antibiotic resistance and DNA protection during stress. Fourteen proteins were increased in abundance in the wild-type strain compared to the resistant strain, including those involved in glycolysis, protein biosynthesis, pentose-phosphate shunt, amino acid transport, cell division and oxidative stress response. In conclusion, our data show overall changes in the subproteome of the piperacillin/tazobactam-resistant strain, reporting for the first time the potential role of a multidrug efflux pump system in E. coli resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam.
