We conducted an anonymous survey of providers who care for older adults from 10 Veterans Affairs long-term-care facilities to assess their knowledge, beliefs, and confidence toward treating infections and antimicrobial stewardship. The average score on 5 questions assessing knowledge was 3.6 out of 5.0 (95% confidence interval, 3.3-3.9), which supports a need for education regarding the care of older adults with infections.
