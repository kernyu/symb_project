Autoreactive T cells in immune thrombocytopenia(ITP) patients undergo a rapid clonal expansion and are resistant to apoptosis to maintain continuous effect in thrombocytopenia. As Bmi-1 is involved in memory CD4+ T cell survival and Th2 proliferation, we hypothesized that Bmi-1 may have a role in autoreactive CD4+ T cell clonal expansion and Th1/Th2 development in ITP patients. We found that CD4+ T cells from active ITP patients had a higher Bmi-1 expression in comparison with remission and healthy controls, and autoreactive CD4+ T cells had more capability to proliferate and resistance to apoptosis than that of healthy controls. We evaluated the part that Bmi-1 played in proliferation and Th1 bias condition of autoreactive CD4+ T cells in ITP. We used lentiviral transfer vectors containing Bmi-1 and shBmi-1 to infect CD4+ T cells from ITP patients and healthy controls during autologous platelets stimulation. Flow cytometry and ELISA were applied to detect various parameters. The results showed that suppression of Bmi-1 using short hairpin RNA inhibited the platelet-mediated proliferation and increased apoptosis of autoreactive CD4+ T cells from ITP patients.Increased Bmi-1 expression in CD4+ T cells from healthy controls promoted the proliferation and inhibited apoptosis of CD4+ T cells. Bmi-1 significantly promoted interleukin-4 secretion by CD4+ T cells. These findings suggest that Bmi-1 plays a part in autoreactive CD4+ T cell proliferative capability and apoptotic resistance in ITP patients.
