Challenges of tuberculosis chemotherapy under conditions of high drug resistant (DR) tuberculosis burden are discussed. Ultimate results of treatment by standard regimens of 1658 patients with new tuberculosis cases and relapses were analyzed. Favorable ultimate results were observed among both patients with new tuberculosis cases and relapses having drugs sensitivity. Efficacy of tuberculosis treatment by standard regimens of chemotherapy is decreasing as a result of DR amplification. Risk factors of unfavorable ultimate result among pulmonary tuberculosis patients are primary resistance to isoniazid (OR = 2.1) and multiple drug resistance of M. tuberculosis (OR = 8.0). Earlier onset of treatment and correct individual therapy with second line drugs as a result of rapid methods of DR tuberculosis diagnostics are those approaches which provide the best therapeutic effect among multiple drug resistant tuberculosis patients both in culture conversion (97.7%) and cavity closure rate (82.7%).
