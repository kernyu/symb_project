PURPOSE: From mid-2010 to early 2013 there was a large single-center (Leipzig University Hospital, Germany) outbreak of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) type 2 producing K. pneumoniae (KPC-2-KP) involving a total of 103 patients. The aim of this study was to compare KPC-positive liver transplant recipients (LTR) and KPC-negative controls to determine both the relative risk of infection following colonization with KPC-2-KP and the case fatality rate associated with KPC-2-KP. METHODS: The study cohort of this retrospective observational study comprised nine patients who had undergone orthotopic liver transplantation (LTx) (median age of 52 years, range 28-73 years) with confirmed evidence of colonization with KPC-2-KP. The data from these nine LTR were matched to 18 LTR (1:2) in whom carbapenem-resistant pathogens were not present and compared for clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Of these nine cases, eight (89 %) progressed to infection due to KPC-2-KP, and five (56 %) were confirmed to have bloodstream infection with KPC-2-KP. Matched-pair analysis of KPC-positive LTR and KPC-negative controls revealed a substantially increased relative risk of 7.0 (95 % confidence interval 1.8-27.1) for fatal infection with KPC-2-producing K. pneumoniae after transplantation with a mortality rate of 78 % (vs. 11 %, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Colonization with KPC-2-KP in LTR leads to high infection rates and excess mortality. Therefore, frequent screening for carbapenem-resistant bacteria in patients on LTx waiting lists appears to be mandatory in an outbreak setting. Patients with evidence of persistent colonization with KPC-producing pathogens should be evaluated with extreme caution for LTx.
