BACKGROUND: Daptomycin is an alternative option for the treatment of catheter-related bloodstream-infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. This study reports a case of a daptomycin and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolate recovered from the blood of a Brazilian patient undergoing hemodialysis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 64-year-old white male patient suffering from diabetes mellitus, systolic hypertension, heart disease with a coronary stent, obesity and chronic renal failure and on use of permcath catheter developed a catheter-related bloodstream-infection by a daptomycin-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolate after one month of daptomycin therapy. The isolate was identified as the SCCmec II/USA100/sequence type 5 lineage by molecular techniques. CONCLUSIONS: In this work we described a Brazilian patient with bloodstream infection caused by a daptomycin and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus belonging to the lineage USA100/sequence type 5. Our case highlights the careful management of bloodstream infections and the importance of the judicious use of antimicrobials due the possibility of daptomycin-resistance developing among S. aureus isolates, especially in patients under hemodialysis, which are frequently exposed to vancomycin and daptomycin therapy.
