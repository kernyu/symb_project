During a 35-day period, 32 isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains were collected by culture from patients with positive nucleic acid amplification test results in Nuuk, Greenland, where ciprofloxacin is the preferred treatment. All isolates were quinolone susceptible, suggesting that resistance is rare. Sampling patients for culture before treatment may prove useful in reestablishing surveillance.
