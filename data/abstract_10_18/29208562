BACKGROUND: Recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (rCDI) places a huge economic and practical burden on healthcare facilities. Furthermore, rCDI may impact quality of life, leaving patients in a 'rCDI cycle', and dependant on antibiotic therapy. AIMS: This article discusses the importance of microbiological factors in the development of rCDI. SOURCES: Literature was drawn from a search of PubMed from 2000 onwards with the search term "recurrent Clostridium difficile infection"; and further references quoted within these articles. CONTENT: Meta-analysis and systematic reviews have shown that CDI and rCDI risk factors are similar. Development of rCDI is attendant upon many factors including immune status/function, comorbidities and concomitant treatments. Studies suggest that poor bacterial diversity is correlated with clinical rCDI. Narrow spectrum gut microflora-sparing antimicrobials (eg surotomycin, cadazolid, ridinilazole) are in development for CDI treatment; while microbiota therapeutics (faecal microbiota transplantation, non-toxigenic C. difficile, stool substitutes) are increasingly being explored. Recurrent CDI can only occur when viable C. difficile spores are present, either within the gut lumen post-infection, or re-acquired from the environment. C. difficile spore germination can be influenced by gut environmental factors resulting from dysbiosis; and spore outgrowth may be affected stage by some antimicrobials, (eg fidaxomicin, ramoplanin, oritavancin). IMPLICATIONS: Recurrent CDI is a significant challenge for healthcare professionals, requiring a multi-faceted approach:optimised infection control to minimise re-infection; C. difficile-targeted antibiotics, to minimise dysbiosis; gut microflora restoration to promote colonisation resistance. These elements should be informed by our understanding of the microbiological factors involved: both C. difficile itself and the gut microbiome.
