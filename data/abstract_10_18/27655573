Objective: To analyze the serotypes and antibiotic resistance phenotypes of non-typhi Salmonella strains in Henan province from 2011 to 2015. Methods: The stool samples were collected from diarrhea patients, and enriched with SBG enrichment broth and the pathogen isolation was conducted with CHROMAgar selective culture medium at 37 for 18-24 hours using KIA/MIU biochemical action and API20E biochemical system slab to identify Salmonella strains. The serotypes of all the positive strains were detected with SSI Salmonella typing sera. According to K-B drug susceptibility testing method published by USA clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), the antibiotics resistant phenotype of the positive strains were analyzed. Results: A total of 1 351 strains of non-typhi Salmonella were isolated, in which 811 were from males, 540 were from females. The ratio of men to women was 1.5ratio1. Children and young adults were mainly affected. The pathogen isolation was mainly in May-October during a year. The 1 351 strains of non-typhi Salmonlla were divided into 58 serotypes. S. enteritidis, S. typhimurium, S. agona, S. derby, S. indiana, S. senftenberg and S. thompson ranked 1(st)-7(th). The drug-resistance rate of the 1 351 strains was 46.1% to synthetic broad-spectrum penicillin ampicillin (AMP), 19.5% and 21.2% to the three generation cephalosporin ceftazidime (CAZ) and cefotaxime (CTX), 8.8% to the four generation cephalosporins cefepime (FEP), 58.7% to the one generation of quinolones nalidixic acid (NAL), 14.7% to the three generation fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin (CIP) and norfloxacin (NOR), 25.0% and 35.6% to aminoglycoside antibiotic gentamicin (GEN) and streptomycin (STR), 35.4% to amphenicols (CHL), 31.7% to sulfonamide trimethoprim (TMP) and 37.8% to tetracycline (TET). Totally 879 strains were multidrug resistant (65.1%): 350 strains were resistant to 3-4 kinds of antibiotics (25.9%), 309 strains were resistant to 5-7 kinds of antibiotics (22.9%), 174 strains were resistant to 8-10 kinds of antibiotics (12.9%) and 48 strains were resistant to 11-12 kinds of antibiotics (3.6%). Conclusion: The serotypes of non-typhi Salmonella strains isolated from Henan province varied, some strains were resistant to 12 kinds of antibiotics commonly used in clinical treatment and the multidrug resistance has become serious.
