Peptic ulcer disease is a multi-factorial disorder of the gastrointestinal tract with a global prevalence affecting about 4.6 million people annually and having a mortality of one death per 10,000 cases. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) plays a profound role in the pathogenesis of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer, including gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue and carcinoma. Any compromise to the gastric mucosal barrier will greatly affect the integrity of the stomach. H. pylori is an organism which mediates a compromise of the gastric mucosal barrier by stimulating increased gastric acid secretion, causing alteration of certain immune factors, penetration of the mucosal layer and provoking persistent inflammation even without invading the mucus membrane. All the different lines of therapy have not shown maximal efficacy in the eradication/cure of the infection in patients. Consequently, alternative therapies including phytomedicines and probiotics have been introduced both in the quest for better eradication therapies and in addressing the problem of H. pylori relapse. In the light of the increasing antibiotic resistance associated with current therapies, the use of herbal preparations or its concomitant use with current therapy has the potential to contribute additive and synergistic effect in the eradication of the H. pylori infection. This review highlights the anti-H. pylori herbal preparations tested and in current use.
