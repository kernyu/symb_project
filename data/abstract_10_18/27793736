OBJECTIVES: Given the increasing number of antifungal drugs and the emergence of resistant Aspergillus isolates, objective, automated and high-throughput antifungal susceptibility testing is important. The EUCAST E.Def 9.3 reference method for MIC determination of Aspergillus species relies on visual reading. Spectrophotometric reading was not adopted because of concern that non-uniform filamentous growth might lead to unreliable and non-reproducible results. We therefore evaluated spectrophotometric reading for the determination of MICs of antifungal azoles against Aspergillus fumigatus. METHODS: Eighty-eight clinical isolates of A. fumigatus were tested against four medical azoles (posaconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, isavuconazole) and one agricultural azole (tebuconazole) with EUCAST E.Def 9.3. The visually determined MICs (complete inhibition of growth) were compared with spectrophotometrically determined MICs and essential (+/-1 twofold dilution) and categorical (susceptible/intermediate/resistant or wild-type/non-wild-type) agreement was calculated. Spectrophotometric data were analysed with regression analysis using the Emax model, and the effective concentration corresponding to 5% (EC5) was estimated. RESULTS: Using the 5% cut-off, high essential (92%-97%) and categorical (93%-99%) agreement (<6% errors) was found between spectrophotometric and visual MICs. The EC5 also correlated with the visually determined MICs with an essential agreement of 83%-96% and a categorical agreement of 90%-100% (<5% errors). CONCLUSIONS: Spectrophotometric determination of MICs of antifungal drugs may increase objectivity, and allow automation and high-throughput of EUCAST E.Def 9.3 antifungal susceptibility testing of Aspergillus species.
