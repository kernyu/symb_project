Due to increasing drug resistance, available antimicrobial options are limited in the treatment of Acinetobacter baumannii infections. Particularly in cases caused by extensively drug-resistant (XDR) A. baumannii, combination regimens must also be taken into consideration. In this study, the efficacies of tigecycline, colistin and tigecycline/colistin combination on bacterial counts in lung tissue were investigated in a rat pneumonia model. One A. baumannii strain resistant to all antimicrobial agents except tigecycline and colistin was selected for the study. In vivo studies revealed a >3 log reduction in bacterial counts in the tigecycline, colistin and combination groups at 24 h and 48 h compared with the control group. No significant differences were determined between colistin, tigecycline and combination groups (P>0.05). On the other hand, differences between treatment groups and the control group were statistically significant (P=0.01). A greater reduction in bacterial counts was observed at 48 h compared with 24 h in the tigecycline group than in the colistin group (P=0.038 and P=0.139, respectively); the most significant decrease between 24 h and 48 h was observed in the combination group (P=0.014). Despite detection of in vitro synergistic activity in this study, no statistically significant differences were found between colistin, tigecycline and combination treatments in terms of efficacy on bacterial counts in lung tissue. In the treatment of infections with a high mortality rate such as pneumonia caused by XDR A. baumannii, combining tigecycline with colistin during the first 48 h and continuing treatment with one of these agents seems a rational approach.
