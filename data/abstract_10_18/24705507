Many diseases spread due to the bacterial infections, which cause significant economic and personal losses. Contact with infected surfaces is likely to catch infections. Hence, antimicrobial surfaces play an important role in public sectors that can prevent the spreading of disease and infection. Coatings on contact surfaces have been used to provide antimicrobial function. Copper (Cu), as one of the commonly used metals, has long been known to possess germ-killing properties. However, metallic Cu or Cu coatings have not been widely used for the purposes of antimicrobial due to the heavy weight, relatively high cost, limited corrosion resistance and low compatibility of the metal with substrates of non-metallic materials. We have recently developed a polymer-based coating system containing mixtures of fine particles of Cu and Cu salt, which provides excellent antimicrobial properties. The results indicate that the coating with embedded fine Cu salt showed higher antimicrobial property than the coating with only Cu due to the release of more Cu ions. The elimination of 10(6) bacteria by contacting the polymer-Cu coatings needs 8 h, while contacting with the polymer-CuCl2 coatings took only 20 min to kill the same amount of bacteria. We have also used transmission electron microscopy and synchrotron infrared microscopy technique to study the degradation of bacterial cell membrane to understand the mechanism of the antimicrobial function of Cu coating.
