Staphylococcus aureus, which has its ecological niche in the anterior nares, has been shown to cause a variety of infectious diseases mainly for patients in hemodialysis units. We performed this study to evaluate the prevalence of nasal S. aureus carriage among hemodialysis outpatients, to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates, to characterize the virulence genes, and to identify associated risk factors. Nares swab specimens were obtained from 70 outpatients on hemodialysis between March and June 2010. Samples were plated immediately onto S. aureus specific media and pattern of antibacterial sensitivity was determined using disk diffusion method. Polymerase chain reaction was used to detect nuc, mecA, and genes encoding staphylococcal toxins. Medical record of patients was explored to determine S.aureus carriage risk factors. Nasal screening identified 42.9% S. aureus carriers with only one (3.3%) methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolate. Among the methicillin-susceptible S. aureus isolates, high rate of penicillin resistance (81.8%) has been detected. The identified risk factors were male gender and age </= 30 years. Research of virulence factors showed a high genetic diversity among the 30 S. aureus isolates. Twenty-one (70%) of them had at least one virulence gene, of which 3.3% were Panton-Valentine leukocidin (lukS/F-PV) genes. S. aureus carriage must be screened for at regular intervals in hemodialysis patients. Setting up a bacterial surveillance system is one of the strategies to understand the epidemiology of methicillin-resistant S. aureus, to guide local antibiotic policy and prevent spread of antibiotic-resistant S. aureus.
