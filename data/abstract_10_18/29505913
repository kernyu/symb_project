OBJECTIVES: Plasmids of different replicon types are believed to be associated with the carriage and transmission of antibiotic resistance genes. Thus present study was undertaken to check the association of CIT with particular plasmid types and to identify the E. coli strains involve in the maintenance of this determinant within the plasmid. METHODS: Screening of AmpC beta-lactamase phenotypically by Modified Three Dimensional Extract Method followed by Antimicrobial Susceptibility and MIC determination. Genotyping screening of beta-lactamase genes was performed by PCR assay followed by their sequencing. Transferability of blaCMY gene was performed by transformation and conjugation and Plasmid Incompatibiltiy typing, DNA fingerprinting by Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus (ERIC) sequences PCR. RESULTS: Thirty seven out of 203 E. coli obtained from different clinical specimens (pus, urine, stool & sputum) were detected with CIT gene and sequencing of this gene showed sequence similarity with the nucleotide of CMY-42 variant. Present study revealed IncI1 plasmids as carriers of blaCMY-42 and its propagation within E. coli ST5377, ST 361, ST 672. As per stability result, this plasmid encoding the blaCMY-42 can be maintained in E. coli strains for longer duration without any antibiotic pressure. CONCLUSIONS: This finding document CMY-42 on IncI1 plasmid type and considered to be the main vehicles for the spread of blaCMY-42 in this hospital setting. Thus, a proper strategy should be developed to check the expansion of IncI1 plasmid type in the hospital and community environment.
