Leishmania-specific cytotoxic T cell response is part of the acquired immune response developed against the parasite and contributes to resistance to reinfection. Herein, we have used an immune-informatic approach for the identification, among Leishmania major potentially excreted/secreted proteins previously described, those generating peptides that could be targeted by the cytotoxic immune response. Seventy-eight nonameric peptides that are predicted to be loaded by HLA-A*0201 molecule were generated and their binding capacity to HLA-A2 was evaluated. These peptides were grouped into 20 pools and their immunogenicity was evaluated by in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HLA-A2+-immune individuals with a history of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis. Six peptides were identified according to their ability to elicit production of granzyme B. Furthermore, among these peptides 3 showed highest affinity to HLA-A*0201, one derived from an elongation factor 1-alpha and two from an unknown protein. These proteins could constitute potential vaccine candidates against leishmaniasis.
