BACKGROUND: DCV-TRIO, a fixed-dose combination of daclatasvir (pangenotypic NS5A inhibitor), asunaprevir (NS3/4A protease inhibitor), and beclabuvir (non-nucleoside NS5B inhibitor), has achieved high rates of sustained virologic response at post-treatment Week 12 (SVR12) in phase 3 studies. METHODS: In this phase 3 study, DCV-TRIO for 12 weeks and daclatasvir plus asunaprevir (DUAL) for 24 weeks were studied in Japanese patients infected with HCV genotype 1 (99 % genotype 1b). RESULTS: SVR12 rates >/=95 % were achieved in both treatment-naive (N = 152) and interferon-experienced (N = 65) cohorts treated with DCV-TRIO for 12 weeks and were comparable across patient subgroups, including patients aged >/=65 years and those with cirrhosis. DUAL recipients (N = 75) had an SVR12 rate of 87 %. In the absence of baseline resistance-associated polymorphisms at positions NS5A-Y93H or -L31, SVR12 rates were 98 % with DCV-TRIO or DUAL. Among genotype 1b-infected patients with baseline Y93H or L31 polymorphisms, 35/38 (92 %) DCV-TRIO recipients, and 7/16 (44 %) DUAL recipients achieved SVR12. Adverse events, mostly liver related, led to treatment discontinuation in 10 % of DCV-TRIO recipients. In this group, SVR12 was achieved by 3/9 patients who discontinued before Week 4 and by 12/12 patients who completed >/=4 weeks of DCV-TRIO. Treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in 4 and 3 % of DCV-TRIO and DUAL recipients, respectively. Seven patients (9 %) discontinued DUAL due to adverse events. No deaths occurred. CONCLUSION: SVR12 was achieved by 96 % of Japanese patients with HCV genotype 1 infection after 12 weeks of treatment with the DCV-TRIO regimen. DCV-TRIO and DUAL exhibited comparable safety profiles.
