Campylobacter spp. is a major cause of foodborne diseases in humans, particularly when transmitted by the handling or consumption of undercooked poultry meat. Most Campylobacter infections are self-limiting, but antimicrobial treatment (e.g., fluoroquinolones and macrolides) is necessary in severe or prolonged cases. The indiscriminate use of these drugs, both in clinical medicine and animal production, has a major impact on public health. The aim of the present study was to identify Campylobacter strains, isolated from turkey and broilers, using both PCR and the matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) methods to reveal the accuracy of identification, as well to evaluate the antimicrobial and genetic resistance of the investigated strains. MALDI-TOF and PCR methods were used to show differences, if any, in the specificity of that test. In this study, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry gave the same results as multiplex PCR, in all cases. The highest rate of resistance (i.e., 100% of turkey and broiler strains) was detected against ciprofloxacin, whereas 58.1% of turkey and 78.6% of broiler strains were resistant to tetracycline. Multidrug-resistant isolates were not found in the study. All ciprofloxacin-resistant strains had a mutation in the gyrA gene, at the Thr-86 position. The presence of the tetO gene was found in 71% of turkey and in 100% of broiler strains. All resistant to tetracycline strains included tetO gene. Additionally, in five turkey and three broiler strains, susceptible to tetracycline, tetO gene was present. These results indicate the high prevalence of Campylobacter strains, which are phenotypically and genetically resistant to fluoroquinolones and tetracycline.
