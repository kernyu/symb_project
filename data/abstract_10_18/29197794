BACKGROUND: Whilst there is evidence of an association between depression and inflammation in adults, there is limited data on this in adolescents particularly in non-westernized populations. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the association between serum hs-CRP level and depression score in adolescent girls living in northwestern Iran. METHOD: Serum hs-CRP was measured in 563 adolescent girls aged 12-18 years. Depression score was assessed using the Beck's depression inventory II (BDI-II). RESULTS: Serum hs-CRP was 0.61 (0.30-0.88) mg/L [median (interquartile range)] in the non-depressed group, 0.97 (0.50-1.82) mg/L in the group with a mild depression score, 1.04 (0.57-1.60) mg/L in those with a moderate depression score, and 0.84 (0.45-2.64) mg/L in girls with severe depression (Kruskal-Wallis test, P<0.001). It has shown that hs-CRP is significantly higher in depressed groups. Multinomial logistic regression analysis, controlling for age, BMI, waist circumference, social class, alcohol consumption, smoking or being passive smoker and recent infections, showed that depression scores were positively associated with serum hs-CRP level (OR=1.93, P<0.001). Using a linear model after adjustment, B (the unstandardized beta) of hs-CRP according to the depression score was 1.43, P<0.001. CONCLUSION: There is a significant association between serum hs-CRP and depression score in adolescent girls. The cross sectional study design does not allow us to conclude that there is a direct relationship between inflammation and depression, and this would need to be tested in an intervention study.
