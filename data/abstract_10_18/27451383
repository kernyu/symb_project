There is wide variation in neonatal dosages of antibiotics in clinical practice, both nationally and internationally. This reflects the lack of evaluation of drugs in this therapeutic class, although widely prescribed. Given this situation, optimization of antibiotic prescription is required to ensure efficacy and safety of neonatal treatment and reduce microbial resistance. Rational prescription should be based on the knowledge of developmental pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Rigorous studies, conducted in collaboration between neonatologists and pharmacologists, are essential to develop and validate evidence-based neonatal dosage regimens.
