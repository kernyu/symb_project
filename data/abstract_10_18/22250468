We report on the TB surveillance data for 2009 in Japan regarding HIV infection, diabetes, and drug susceptibility test results, which were added to the central TB surveillance database from 2007. In the present TB surveillance system, we cannot obtain reliable data about whether or not HIV tests were done in each case. Thus, we report only the number of TB patients diagnosed as having HIV infection. The number of newly notified TB cases reported as having HIV from 2007-2009 is 176. Of those, 155 (88.1%) were male and 21 (11.9%) were female, and 39 (22.2%) were foreigners. The frequency of TB-associated diabetes in newly notified TB cases in 2009 was 12.6% (3,043/24,170) in total, 14.5% in males, and 9.5% in females. Drug susceptibility test results were obtained in 6,920 culture-positive pulmonary TB cases through the surveillance system in 2009. This figure accounted for 63.5% of all culture-positive pulmonary cases. In primary cases, the frequencies of MDR, any INH resistance, and any RFP resistance were 0.5%, 4.4%, and 0.8%, respectively, and in re-treatment cases, they were 3.6%, 11.6%, and 5.0%, respectively. In primary pulmonary cases theses drug resistance rates have been stable over this 3-year period (2007-2009), but in pulmonary cases undergoing re-treatment, the frequency has decreased (for example, the MDR rate in re-treatment pulmonary cases was 7.2% in 2007, 5.1% in 2008, and 3.6% in 2009). Of all MDR pulmonary cases, 17.9% (10/56) were foreigners in 2009.
