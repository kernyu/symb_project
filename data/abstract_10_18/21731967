Non-O1, and non-O139 Vibrio cholerae is an infrequent cause of bacteremia. There are no reports of such bacteremia in chronic hemodialysis patients. This work describes the case of a chronic hemodialysis patient that had an episode of septicemia associated with dialysis. Blood cultures were obtained and treatment was begun with vancomycin and ceftazidime. After 6.5 hours of incubation in the Bact/Alert system there is evidence of gram-negative curved bacilli that were identified as Vibrio cholerae by conventional biochemical tests, API 20 NE and the VITEK 2 system. This microorganism was sent to the reference laboratory for evaluation of serogroup and virulence factors and was identified as belonging to the non-O1 and non-O139 serogroup. The cholera toxin, colonization factor and heat-stable toxin were not detected. The isolate was susceptible to ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, ceftazidime and cefotaxime by the disk diffusion method and the VITEK 2 system. The patient received intravenous ceftazidime for a 14 day- period and had a favorable outcome.
