VIM-1 metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from 35 Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital patients from September 2007 to July 2008. All but one were highly resistant to all beta-lactams, aminoglycoside, and fluoroquinolone, and one susceptible to amikacin. Strains negative to a disk diffusion screening test using sodium mercaptoacetate for detecting MBL numbered 35. PCR for MBL indicated all strains were positive for bla(VIWM-1). These strains were indistinguishable by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, indicating an outbreak of infections caused by VIM-1 MBL producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa. After intervention to control contact, the outbreak was controlled.
