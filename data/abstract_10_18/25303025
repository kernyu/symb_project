We document the anti-HIV activity of nitazoxanide (NTZ), the first member of the thiazolide class of antiinfective drugs, originally effective against enteritis caused by Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia lamblia. NTZ has been administered extensively worldwide, with no severe toxicities associated with its use. Here, we show for the first time that NTZ decreases HIV-1 replication in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) if present before or during HIV-1 infection. This NTZ effect is associated with downregulation of HIV-1 receptors CD4 and CCR5, and increasing gene expression of host cell anti-HIV resistance factors APOBEC3A/3G and tetherin. As NTZ is already in clinical use for other conditions, this newly described anti-HIV activity in MDM may facilitate innovative intensification strategies against HIV-1 when combined with current antiretroviral drug regimens.
