Treatment of infections is a team medical care operation, utilizing the coordinated expertise of many different professionals. Among these, the duty of the pharmacist, as a drug specialist, is considered to be related to the proper use of antibacterial drugs. When selecting an antibacterial drug, it is important to understand the severity and infection source of the patient, and consider drug susceptibility and tissue transitivity based on the antibiogram at the hospital. Moreover, consideration of the specific clinical conditions of pregnant or nursing women, and children, as well as any organ dysfunctions, is required to determine the appropriate antibacterial drug and its proper use. The dosage and administration method of the selected antibacterial drug are determined based on factors such as PK-PD parameters and organ dysfunction of the patient. For drugs requiring TDM, implementation of TDM, determination and evaluation of efficacy, and suggestions to change the antibacterial drug, its dosage, or administration method when needed, are all considered to play a part in the treatment of infection. The duty of the pharmacist is to promote the proper use of antibacterial drugs and participate in the treatment of patients. Moreover, since the proper use of an antibacterial drug and effective use of PK-PD parameters lead to prevention of the emergence of resistant bacteria, we would like to contribute to the preservation of antibacterial drugs as well.
