Praziquantel is currently the only drug available to treat schistosomiasis. Since drug resistance would be a major barrier for the increasing global attempts to eliminate schistosomiasis as a public health problem, efforts should go hand in hand with the discovery of novel treatment options. Synthetic peroxides might offer a good direction since their antischistosomal activity has been demonstrated in the laboratory. We studied 19 bridged 1,2,4,5-tetraoxanes, 2 tricyclic monoperoxides, 11 bridged 1,2,4-trioxolanes, 12 silyl peroxides, and 4 hydroxylamine derivatives against newly transformed schistosomula (NTS) and adult Schistosoma mansoni in vitro. Schistosomicidal compounds were tested for cytotoxicity followed by in vivo studies of the most promising compounds. Tricyclic monoperoxides, trioxolanes, and tetraoxanes revealed the highest in vitro activity against NTS (IC50s 0.4-20.2 muM) and adult schistosomes (IC50s 1.8-22.8 muM). Tetraoxanes showed higher cytotoxicity than antischistosomal activity. Selected trioxolane and tricyclic monoperoxides were tested in mice harboring an adult S. mansoni infection. The highest activity was observed for two trioxolanes, which showed moderate worm burden reductions (WBR) of 44.3% and 42.9% (p>0.05). Complexation of the compounds with beta-cyclodextrin with the aim to improve solubility and gastrointestinal absorption did not increase in vivo antischistosomal efficacy. The high in vitro antischistosomal activity of trioxolanes and tricyclic monoperoxides is a promising basis for future investigations, with the focus on improving in vivo efficacy.
