Sepsis in children is a complex syndrome that develops from various infections and results in 15-30% mortality in high-income countries and up to 50% or higher in low-income countries. Worldwide, this represents an annual burden of 30 million cases resulting in 8 million deaths. Not surprisingly, there is a significantly higher burden in low-income countries with children there being 18 times more likely to die before the age of 5 years compared to high-income countries. Factors such as commercial air travel, climate change, and unchecked population growth have contributed to the growing burden of infectious diseases and ensuing sepsis. In this article, we review the important role of global advocacy to improve public awareness of sepsis; increase access to essential medicines and vaccines; improve use of evidence-based treatment guidelines; raise awareness of antimicrobial resistance and encourage antibiotic stewardship; and, develop resilient health systems that can cope with health crises. Advocacy in these areas can assist nations in reaching the United Nations sustainable development goals (UN SDGs) of low rates of neonatal and under-5 mortality.
