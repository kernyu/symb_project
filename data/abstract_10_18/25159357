BACKGROUND: MEDIHONEY (Derma Sciences, Inc., Toronto, Ontario M1S 3S4, Canada) was cleared by the Food and Drug Administration for use on tramatic wounds, diabetic ulcers, and second-degree burns against normal skin flora but not necessarily against multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) infecting these wounds or its associated recovery and healing rate. METHODS: Here, we report on the efficacy of this medical grade honey treatment against two MDROs (Acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA]). In this initial phase (Part I), an in-laboratory validation and characterization of the efficacy against antibiotic-resistant bacteria were performed in vitro. RESULTS: The antimicrobial resistance of both MDROs was confirmed in vitro using standard microbiology techniques and species' DNA signatures. The minimum inhibitory concentration of the MEDIHONEY was determined to be 3.5% for MRSA and 8.5% for A. baumannii. The minimum bactericidal concentrations determined against MRSA and multidrug-resistant A. baumannii were shown to be 9.5% and 10.5%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our in vitro findings support the efficacy of MEDIHONEY against MRSA and A. baumannii as requested by first responders. We also conducted screening assays using other "supermarket brands" of honey. All cultures from the latter showed bacterial and fungal growths. The use of supermarket brand honey for wound treatment is discouraged.
