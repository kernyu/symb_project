A fixed-dose, single-tablet regimen comprising the integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) dolutegravir and the nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) abacavir and lamivudine (abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine; Triumeq(R)) is now available for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. In a randomized, double-blind, phase III trial in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive adults (SINGLE), once-daily dolutegravir plus abacavir/lamivudine had noninferior efficacy to once-daily efavirenz/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF)/emtricitabine with regard to establishing and sustaining virological suppression over 144 weeks, and subsequent superiority testing significantly favoured dolutegravir plus abacavir/lamivudine. This outcome was predominantly driven by more favourable rates of discontinuation due to adverse events versus the efavirenz/tenofovir DF/emtricitabine group. These data were generally supported by findings from other phase III trials in ART-naive adults receiving dolutegravir plus either abacavir/lamivudine or tenofovir DF/emtricitabine (SPRING-2 and FLAMINGO). Dolutegravir plus abacavir/lamivudine is generally well tolerated, with a tolerability profile that appears to be more favourable than efavirenz/tenofovir DF/emtricitabine. In the SINGLE trial, there were no major treatment-emergent INSTI or NRTI resistance-associated mutations in dolutegravir plus abacavir/lamivudine recipients with protocol-defined virological failure, indicating a high genetic barrier to resistance. Thus, triple combination therapy with abacavir, dolutegravir and lamivudine is an effective, generally well tolerated option for the management of HIV-1 infection, with the convenient once-daily fixed-dose tablet providing the first single-tablet regimen option without tenofovir DF.
