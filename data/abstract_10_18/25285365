UNLABELLED: Candida glabrata has emerged as an opportunistic pathogen of considerable importance in invasive and superficial infections. AIMS: To analyze the development of fluconazole resistance in patients under treatment through epidemiological survey in our hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty two patients (89 clinical strains) were collected. Molecular typing of isolates was performed by polymorphic markers. Analysis of gene expression was realized by reverse transcriptase-real time polymerase chain reactions (RT-qPCR). RESULTS: Genetic analysis showed that 63% persists with apparently unchanged strains (n=14). Among them, four showed fluconazole resistance development. A strain replacement was observed in 6 patients and two patients selected more resistant isolates during the course of treatment. An analysis of Candida glabrata cerebellar degeneration-related protein 1 (CgCDR1), Candida glabrata cerebellar degeneration-related protein 2 (CgCDR2) and Candida glabrata sterol 14 alpha-demetylase Erg 11 (CgERG11) expression revealed an over-expression in 10 resistant isolates. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that C. glabrata strain undergo frequent changes in vivo. The increase in CgCDR1 and CgCDR2 expression was the most mechanism associated with fluconazole resistance.
