BACKGROUND: The recommended regimen for treating uncomplicated gonorrhea has changed over time, due to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. We assessed physician knowledge of the recommendation for treating uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhea in adolescents and adults using ceftriaxone and azithromycin dual therapy. METHODS: We analyzed DocStyles 2015 survey data from 1357 primary care physicians practicing for at least 3 years who provided screening, diagnosis, or treatment for sexually transmitted diseases to one or more patients in an average month. Logistic regression and chi analyses were used to identify factors associated with knowledge of dual therapy. RESULTS: Among the options of treatment with ceftriaxone alone, azithromycin alone, both of these, or spectinomycin plus levofloxacin, 64% of physicians correctly preferred ceftriaxone plus azithromycin. Knowledge of the recommended dual therapy decreased with increasing years of practice, ranging from 74% among physicians with 3-9 years of practice to 57% among those practicing for >/=24 years (adjusted odds ratio, ORa, for >/=24 vs 3-9 years of practice, 0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35-0.70). Knowledge of dual therapy decreased with higher socioeconomic status of patients (ORa for high income vs poor/lower middle income patients, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.32-0.69). Physicians who pursued continuing medical education using journals, podcasts, and government health agencies were more likely to report dual therapy than those who did not use these sources (ORa, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.31-3.33). CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of the recommended regimen for treating gonorrhea decreased with increasing years of practice and with higher socioeconomic status of patients.
