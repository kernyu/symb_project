Staphylococcus epidermidis is reported to be the main causative agent of nosocomial infections. It has become increasingly difficult to treat this micro-organism because of the emergence of new antibiotic-resistant strains and its ability to form biofilm on medical associated devices. Phytochemicals acting in synergy are effective in killing the micro-organisms by lowering the doses, and synergistic compounds evade the development of resistance due to different mechanism of action. This study aims to determine the synergistic antimicrobial potential of curcumin with cinnamaldehyde, eugenol, and ellagic acid against S. epidermidis. Curcumin with ellagic acid as well as eugenol were found to have additive antimicrobial effect, whereas, in combination, curcumin and cinnamaldehyde were found to have synergistic effect against S. epidermidis (fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) = 0.5). Synergy between curcumin and cinnamaldehyde was established by time-kill kinetics and was further evaluated for antibiofilm activity. The dose required to inhibit biofilm formation was reduced to half than that needed to inhibit its planktonic culture (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of curcumin = 3.12 mug/ml; MIC of cinnamaldehyde = 15.62 mug/ml; FICI = 0.248). Both curcumin and cinnamaldehyde disrupted the bacterial membrane for killing the bacteria as determined by permeability studies on Escherichia coli ML-35p.
