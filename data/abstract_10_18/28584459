The study was aimed to characterize enterococci from various clinical specimens, to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern, and to explore the association between virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance. A total of 283 clinical enterococcal isolates were speciated and subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Virulence factors (hemolysin, gelatinase, and biofilm production) were detected phenotypically. Of the 283 enterococci isolated, 12 species were identified; predominant species were Enterococcus faecalis (82.33%). High-level gentamicin (HLG) and vancomycin resistance were observed among 55.57% and 6.01% of enteroccal isolates, respectively. All vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VREs) were E. faecalis and had VanA phenotype and genotype. Hemolysin, gelatinase, and biofilm production were seen in 15.90%, 12.36%, and 13.43% of enterococcal isolates, respectively. Vancomycin and HLG resistance were observed in 0.35% and 61.86% of the enterococcal isolates producing virulence factors. Isolates resistant to HLG but susceptible to vancomycin expressed more virulent factors. Further research is required to reveal the complex interplay between drug resistance and virulence factors.
