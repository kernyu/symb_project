OBJECTIVES: There is no pharmacokinetic interaction between tenofovir and nevirapine, but a higher emergence rate of resistance mutations has been reported when these drugs are coadministered. We sought to examine if there is a potential intracellular interaction that may account for the emergence of resistant virus. METHODS: Primary CD4+ and CD14+ cells were isolated from healthy volunteer blood. Monocyte-derived macrophages were differentiated from CD14+ cells. Accumulation of radiolabelled tenofovir and nevirapine was then assessed in these cells. RESULTS: We show here that tenofovir and nevirapine immune cell intracellular concentrations are lower when coincubated in CD4+ cells and monocyte-derived macrophages, but not in CD14+ cells. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate a potential intracellular drug-drug interaction between these drugs that warrants further investigation.
