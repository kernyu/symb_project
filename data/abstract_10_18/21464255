This study explores the effects of cefditoren (CDN) versus amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (AMC) on the evolution (within a single strain) of total and recombined populations derived from intrastrain ftsI gene diffusion in beta-lactamase-positive (BL(+)) and beta-lactamase-negative (BL(-)) Haemophilus influenzae. DNA from beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) isolates (DNA(BLNAR)) and from beta-lactamase-positive, amoxicillin-clavulanate-resistant (BLPACR) (DNA(BLPACR)) isolates was extracted and added to a 10(7)-CFU/ml suspension of one BL(+) strain (CDN MIC, 0.007 mug/ml; AMC MIC, 1 mug/ml) or one BL(-) strain (CDN MIC, 0.015 mug/ml; AMC MIC, 0.5 mug/ml) in Haemophilus Test Medium (HTM). The mixture was incubated for 3 h and was then inoculated into a two-compartment computerized device simulating free concentrations of CDN (400 mg twice a day [b.i.d.]) or AMC (875 and 125 mg three times a day [t.i.d.]) in serum over 24 h. Controls were antibiotic-free simulations. Colony counts were performed; the total population and the recombined population were differentiated; and postsimulation MICs were determined. At time zero, the recombined population was 0.00095% of the total population. In controls, the BL(-) and BL(+) total populations and the BL(-) recombined population increased (from approximately 3 log(1)(0) to 4.5 to 5 log(1)(0)), while the BL(+) recombined population was maintained in simulations with DNA(BLPACR) and was decreased by approximately 2 log(1)(0) with DNA(BLNAR). CDN was bactericidal (percentage of the dosing interval for which experimental antibiotic concentrations exceeded the MIC [ft>MIC], >88%), and no recombined populations were detected from 4 h on. AMC was bactericidal against BL(-) strains (ft>MIC, 74.0%) in DNA(BLNAR) and DNA(BLPACR) simulations, with a small final recombined population (MIC, 4 mug/ml; ft>MIC, 30.7%) in DNA(BLPACR) simulations. When AMC was used against the BL(+) strain (in DNA(BLNAR) or DNA(BLPACR) simulations), the bacterial load was reduced approximately 2 log(1)(0) (ft>MIC, 44.3%), but 6.3% and 32% of the total population corresponded to a recombined population (MIC, 16 mug/ml; ft>MIC, 0%) in DNA(BLNAR) and DNA(BLPACR) simulations, respectively. AMC, but not CDN, unmasked BL(+) recombined populations obtained by transformation. ft>MIC values higher than those classically considered for bacteriological response are needed to counter intrastrain ftsI gene diffusion by covering recombined populations.
