Protein secretion is a general phenomenon by which cells communicate with the extracellular environment. Secretory proteins, including hormones, enzymes, toxins, and antimicrobial peptides have various functions in extracellular environments. Here, we determined that ribosomal protein S3 (rpS3) is homodimerized and secreted in several cancer cell lines such as HT1080 (human fibrosarcoma) and MPC11 (mouse plasmacytoma). Moreover, we found that the secreted rpS3 protein increased in doxorubicin-resistant MPC11 cells compared to that in MPC11 cells. In addition, we also detected that the level of secreted rpS3 increased in more malignant cells, which were established with continuous exposure of cigarette smoke condensate. These findings suggest that the secreted rpS3 protein is an indicator of malignant tumors.
