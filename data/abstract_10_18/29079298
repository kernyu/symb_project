Clarithromycin resistance is increasing dramatically among Mycobacterium abscessus complex. The main resistance mechanisms are mutations in the erm(41) and rrl genes. Here we report PCR-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) as an alternative method for rapidly detection of mutations in erm(41) and rrl among M. abscessus isolates. Four primer sets targeting the full-length erm(41) gene and a 354bp fragment of the rrl gene were designed. A combination of 16 different DGGE patterns were observed for erm(41) gene, including 16 in M. abscessus subsp. abscessus and 1 in M. abscessus subsp. massiliense. Six DGGE patterns were obtained for rrl gene. Mutations in the erm(41) and rrl detected by DGGE were 100% identical to mutations detected by DNA sequencing. This is the first report to identify PCR-based DGGE as a practical, relatively inexpensive technique for rapidly detecting mutations in the erm(41) and rrl genes associated with clarithromycin resistance in M. abscessus complex.
