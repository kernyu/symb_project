To investigate the nature and origin of the antibacterial activity of the lytic phage varphiAB2 toward Acinetobacter baumannii, we successfully isolated and characterized a novel phage lysozyme (endolysin) from varphiAB2 and named it LysAB2. To analyze antibacterial activity of LysAB2, the complete LysAB2 and two deletion derivatives were constructed, purified and characterized. Zymographic assays showed that only the intact LysAB2 could lyse the peptidoglycan of A. baumannii and the Staphylococcus aureus cell wall. Antibacterial analysis also showed that only the intact LysAB2 retained the complete bactericidal activity. When applied exogenously, LysAB2 exhibited a broad bacteriolytic activity against a number of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Thermostability assays indicated that LysAB2 was stable at 20 approximately 40 degrees C. Its optimal pH was 6.0, and it was active from pH 4 to 8. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that exposure to 500 mugml(-1) LysAB2 for up to 60 min caused a remarkable modification of the cell shape of the bacteria. Treating bacteria with LysAB2 clearly enhanced permeation of the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. These results indicate that LysAB2 is an effective lysozyme against bacteria, and they suggest that it is a good candidate for a therapeutic/disinfectant agent to control nosocomial infections caused by multiple drug-resistant bacteria.
