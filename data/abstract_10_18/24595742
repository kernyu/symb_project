This study was conducted in order to investigate the effects of polymyxin B (PMB) against hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats with obstructive jaundice. Thirty-six Wistar rats (eighteen each) with induced hepatic I/R injury by biliary tract ligation and recanalization were assigned to a control group (reperfused with normal saline) and a PMB group (reperfused with PMB). Indicators involving liver function, oxidation resistance, pro-inflammatory state, and anti-apoptosis effect were determined following the instructions. Compared with normal saline, PMB reperfusion resulted in a significant improvement of liver function (increase of glutathione and reduction of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase), oxidation resistance (decreased malondialdehyde and myeloperoxidase activity), alleviation of pro-inflammatory state (less tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) mRNA, and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1), and anti-apoptosis effect (more Bcl-2 and less Bax). PMB protects the liver from I/R injury mainly through reducing cellular oncosis and apoptosis and regulating the expression of NF-kappaB, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and ICAM-1.
