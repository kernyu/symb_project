OBJECTIVES: Biofilms are associated with persistent infections and resistant to conventional therapeutic strategies. The aim of this study was to investigate the quantity of biofilm produced on silicone intranasal splints. METHODS: Quantity of biofilm formation on silicone splints (SS) was tested on 15 strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Moraxella catarrhalis, respectively. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed in accordance with European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing recommendations. RESULTS: All tested strains formed different amounts of biofilm on SS: 66.7% S. aureus and 93.3% M. catarrhalis were weak biofilm producers and 33.3% S. aureus and 6.7% M. catarrhalis were moderate biofilm producers. S. aureus formed significantly higher quantity of biofilm compared with M. catarrhalis (p < 0.05). Multidrug resistant S. aureus produced significantly higher amount of biofilm compared with non-multidrug resistant strains (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Quantity of biofilm on SS is highly dependent on bacterial species and their resistance patterns. Future studies are needed to ascertain another therapeutic option for prophylaxis prior to SS placement.
