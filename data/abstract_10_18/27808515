We describe the research that led to the discovery of compound 40 (ruzasvir, MK-8408), a pan-genotypic HCV nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) inhibitor with a "flat" GT1 mutant profile. This NS5A inhibitor contains a unique tetracyclic indole core while maintaining the imidazole-proline-valine Moc motifs of our previous NS5A inhibitors. Compound 40 is currently in early clinical trials and is under evaluation as part of an all-oral DAA regimen for the treatment of chronic HCV infection.
