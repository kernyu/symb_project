BACKGROUND: Integrons are mobile DNA elements and they have an important role in acquisition and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes. However, there are limited data available on integrons of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) from bovine mastitis, especially from Chinese dairy cows. To address this knowledge gap, bovine mastitis-inducing S. aureus isolates were investigated for the presence of integrons as well as characterization of gene cassettes. Integrons were detected using PCR reactions and then further characterized by a restriction fragment-length polymorphism analysis and amplicon sequencing. RESULTS: All 121 S. aureus isolates carried the class 1 integrase gene intI1, with no intI2 and intI3 genes detected. One hundred and three isolates were positive for the presence of 12 resistance genes, either alone or in combination with other gene cassettes. These resistance genes encoded resistance to trimethoprim (dhfrV, dfrA1, dfrA12), aminoglycosides (aadA1, aadA5, aadA4, aadA24, aacA4, aadA2, aadB), chloramphenicol (cmlA6) and quaternary ammonium compound (qacH) and were organized into 11 different gene cassettes arrangements (A-K). The gene cassette arrays dfrA1-aadA1 (D, 44.6%), aadA2 (K, 31.4%), dfrA12-orfX2-aadA2 (G, 27.3%) and aadA1 (A, 25.6%) were most prevalent. Furthermore, 74 isolates contained combinations of 2 to 4 gene cassette arrays. Finally, all of the integron/cassettes-positive isolates were resistant to aminoglycoside antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study on the integrons and gene cassette arrays in S. aureus isolates from milk of mastitic cows from Northwestern China and provide the evidence for class 1 integron as possible antibiotic resistance determinants on dairy farms.
