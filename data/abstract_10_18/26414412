Implant-associated infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. This study was performed using titanium samples coated by anodization with a titanium dioxide (TiO2) shielded nanotube layer. TiO2/Ti surface was modified by simple immersion in torularhodin solution and by using a mussel-inspired method based on polydopamine as bio adhesive for torularhodin immobilization. SEM analysis revealed tubular microstructures of torularhodin and the PDA ability to function as a catchy anchor between torularhodin and TiO2 surface. Corrosion resistance was associated with TiO2 barrier oxide layer and nano-organized oxide layer and the torularhodin surface modification does not bring significant changes in resistance of the oxide layer. Our results demonstrated that the torularhodin modified TiO2/Ti surface could effectively prevent adhesion and proliferation of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The new modified titanium surface showed good biocompatibility and well-behaved haemocompatibility. This biomaterial with enhanced antimicrobial activity holds great potential for future biomedical applications.
