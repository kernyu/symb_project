Resistance to minocycline has emerged in multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii isolates from Buenos Aires hospitals. Few reports about the description and dispersion of tet genes in this species have been published. We observed the presence of tet(B) in all minocycline-resistant isolates. This gene was found to be associated with the ISCR2 mobile element, which may, in part, explain its dispersion.
