Bacillus subtilis encodes seven extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factors. Three (sigma(M), sigma(W), and sigma(X)) mediate responses to cell envelope-active antibiotics. The functions of sigma(V), sigma(Y), sigma(Z), and sigma(YlaC) remain largely unknown, and strong inducers of these sigma factors and their regulons have yet to be defined. Here, we define transcriptomic and phenotypic differences under nonstress conditions between a strain carrying deletions in all seven ECF sigma factor genes (the Delta7ECF mutant), a DeltaMWX triple mutant, and the parental 168 strain. Our results identify >80 genes as at least partially dependent on ECF sigma factors, and as expected, most of these are dependent on sigma(M), sigma(W), or sigma(X), which are active at a significant basal level during growth. Several genes, including the eps operon encoding enzymes for exopolysaccharide (EPS) production, were decreased in expression in the Delta7ECF mutant but affected less in the DeltaMWX mutant. Consistent with this observation, the Delta7ECF mutant (but not the DeltaMWX mutant) showed reduced biofilm formation. Extending previous observations, we also note that the DeltaMWX mutant is sensitive to a variety of antibiotics and the Delta7ECF mutant is either as sensitive as, or slightly more sensitive than, the DeltaMWX strain to these stressors. These findings emphasize the overlapping nature of the seven ECF sigma factor regulons in B. subtilis, confirm that three of these (sigma(M), sigma(W), and sigma(X)) play the dominant role in conferring intrinsic resistance to antibiotics, and provide initial insights into the roles of the remaining ECF sigma factors.
