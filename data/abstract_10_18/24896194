Specific inhibitors such as 2-bromoethanesulfonate (BES) and vancomycin were employed in activity batch tests to decipher metabolic pathways that are preferentially used by a mixed anaerobic consortium (sludge from an anaerobic digester) to transform carbon monoxide (CO) into methane (CH4). We first evaluated the inhibitory effect of both BES and vancomycin on the microbial community, as well as the efficiency and stability of vancomycin at 35 degrees C, over time. The activity tests with CO2-H2, CO, glucose, acetate, formate, propionate, butyrate, methanol, and ethanol showed that vancomycin does not inhibit some Gram-negative bacteria, and 50 mmol/L BES effectively blocks CH4 production in the sludge. However, when sludge was incubated with propionate, butyrate, methanol, or ethanol as the sole energy and carbon source, methanogenesis was only partially inhibited by BES. Separate tests showed that 0.07 mmol/L vancomycin is enough to maintain its inhibitory efficiency and stability in the population for at least 32 days at 35 degrees C. Using the inhibitors above, it was demonstrated that CO conversion to CH4 is an indirect, 2-step process, in which the CO is converted first to acetate and subsequently to CH4.
