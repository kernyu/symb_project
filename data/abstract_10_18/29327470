BACKGROUND: Calcium hydroxide is a common endodontic medicament and has an antimicrobial effect by increasing the localized pH within the root canal. However, Enterococcus faecalis has shown some resistance to calcium hydroxide. METHODS: A flow cell apparatus was used to grow an E. faecalis biofilm on dentine discs. Following 4 weeks growth in Todd Hewitt Broth, flow cells were exposed to either a rapid or slow increase to pH 11.5 or 12.5. Cellular viability was determined using serial plating and the number of colony-forming units was normalized against the cellular protein content. Scanning electron microscopy was carried out to qualitatively observe the effects of the different rates of pH increase. RESULTS: A significant difference in viability between the pH rapid and slow groups was not shown in this study. Compared with pH 11.5 solutions, pH 12.5 solutions were more effective at killing bacteria although some E. faecalis still survived. CONCLUSIONS: Enterococcus faecalis did not adapt and develop a greater resistance to high pH following a slow rise in pH compared with a rapid rise in pH. As expected, pH 12.5 was more effective in reducing bacterial numbers compared with pH 11.5 although E. faecalis was not completely eliminated.
