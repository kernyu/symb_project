OBJECTIVE: To investigate the regulation mechanism of T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-3 (Tim-3) combined with toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) or TLR4 on antiviral immune and inflammatory response in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. METHODS: Patients with chronic HCV infection and healthy control subjects were recruited. Patients received interferon (IFN)-alpha based therapy. Plasma galectin-9 (Gal-9) was quantitated. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were cultured with TLR3 or TLR4 agonists, alone or in combination with Tim-3 antagonist. Levels of IFN-alpha, TNF-alpha, and 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase (2'-5'OAS), myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) and suppressor of cytokine 1 (SOCS1) RNA in PBMC cultures were evaluated. RESULTS: Plasma Gal-9 levels were increased in patients (n = 52) compared with controls (n = 20) and significantly declined at treatment week 12 and 24 weeks post-treatment. IFN-alpha, 2'-5'OAS, MxA, TNF-alpha and SOCS1 were upregulated by TLR3 and TLR4 agonists. TNF-alpha and SOCS1 levels were suppressed by the addition of Tim-3 antagonist. CONCLUSIONS: Tim-3 blockade in combination with TLR activation induces the expression of antiviral molecules without a significant increase in TNF-alpha or SOCS1.
