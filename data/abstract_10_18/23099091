Three novel series of 5-aryloxypyrazole derivatives have been synthesized and tested for their antibacterial activity. The majority of the synthesized compounds showed potent inhibitory activity against Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus 4220, especially against the strains of multidrug-resistant clinical isolates (MRSA3167/3506 and QRSA3505/3519). Among which compounds IIIb, IIIg and IIIm showed the most potent levels of activity (MIC=1 mug/mL) against the multidrug-resistant strains. And cytotoxic activity assay showed that the compounds tested did not affect cell viability on the Human cervical (HeLa) cells at their MICs. The current study therefore suggests that 5-aryloxypyrazoles bearing a rhodanine-3-aromatic acid moiety are promising scaffolds for the development of novel Gram-positive antibacterial agents.
