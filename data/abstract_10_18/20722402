The expression of the gene products in many methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains is regulated by the gene repressor BlaI. Here we show that BlaI is a mixture of monomer and dimer at in vivo concentrations, binds to the operator regions preferentially as a monomeric protein, and the measured dissociation constants and in vivo concentrations account for the basal level transcription of the resistance genes. These observations for the first time provide a quantitative picture of the processes that take place in the cytoplasm that lead to the induction of antibiotic resistance factors to counter the challenge by beta-lactams.
