A comprehensive treatment with Likopid of chronic generalized parodontitis in 114 elderly and senile patients was carried out. The state of mechanisms of innate immunity (phagocytosis mechanisms) as well as the profile of proinflammatory cytokines was assessed. The effect of antibiotic-resistant strains of prior microflora on the combined therapy of patients of different age with chronic generalized parodontitis was studied. It is established that due to presence of various types of opportunistic pathogens in patients of different age with parodontitis using the prophylactic antibiotics for the empirical (to determine the antibiotic resistance), a combination of Metronidazole and Lincomycin with the mandatory appointment of immunomodulatory drugs for activation of monocyte-phagocytic system of the patient elderly is most advisable. Use of the drug , "Likopid" significantly improves the results of treatment the elderly and old patients with chronic generalized parodonthitis.
