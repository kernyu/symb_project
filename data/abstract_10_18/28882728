OBJECTIVES: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common cause of pneumonia in patients with cystic fibrosis with the property to generate multidrug resistance against clinically used antibiotics. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a diverse group of effector molecules of the innate immune system that protect the host against pathogens. However, the lack of activity in common biological matrices has hampered efforts towards clinical development. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of the engineered AMP WLBU2 via direct airway delivery in a murine model of P. aeruginosa infection. METHODS: The human AMPs LL37 and WLBU2 were compared for (i) antibiofilm activity using P. aeruginosa on polarized human bronchial epithelial cells, and (ii) efficacy in P. aeruginosa pneumonia in mice using intratracheal instillation of bacteria and AMPs. RESULTS: WLBU2 (16 muM) prevents biofilm formation by up to 3-log compared with 1-log reduction by LL37. With a single dose of 1 mug (0.05 mg/kg) delivered intratracheally, the initial effect of LL37 was moderate and transitory, as bacterial load and inflammatory cytokines increased at 24 h with observed signs of disease such as lethargy and hypothermia, consistent with moribund state requiring euthanasia. In sharp contrast, WLBU2 reduced bacterial burden (by 2 logs) and bacteria-induced inflammation (leucocytic infiltrates, cytokine and chemokine gene expression) at 6 h and 24 h post-exposure, with no observed signs of disease or host toxicity. CONCLUSION: These promising results now establish a much lower minimum therapeutic dose of WLBU2 (a net gain of 80-fold) compared with the previously reported 4 mg/kg systemic minimum therapeutic dose, with significant implications for clinical development.
