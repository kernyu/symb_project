beta-lactams therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) appears as an essential tool to ensure the achievement of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic targets and prevent induced toxicity in intensive care unit patients. Indeed, those patients exhibit important pharmacokinetic variabilities that could lead to unpredictable plasma concentrations, potentially associated with poor clinical outcome, development of antibiotic resistance or increased side effects. Here, we report the case of a 48-year-old-patient admitted to intensive care unit and treated by cefepime using TDM. Due to inconsistency between observed cefepime plasma concentrations and patient clinical examination, investigations were started. After analytical tests, we highlighted an underlying analytical interference that overestimated cefepime plasma concentration with our in-house high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) method. Only the inadequacy between plasmatic concentration and patient situation alerted pharmacologists and clinicians. As we found no previous case in literature, we believe this report must serve as an example of analytical limits that required pharmacologist awareness and expertise in TDM realization.
