The treatment of bacterial skin infections has become challenging with the evolution of resistant species. As common antibiotics are losing efficacy, there is a pressing need for the discovery of new antibacterial agents. Only several systemic antibiotics have been approved for the treatment of skin infections in recent years. The expanding repertoire includes novel compounds structurally based on existing antibiotic classes, such as the glycopeptides, cephalosporins, and glycylcyclines. Antibiotics with completely unique mechanisms of action are being developed as members of the lipoprotein, oxazolidonone, and streptogramin classes. Most of these drugs require intravenous administration that limits their use. Future development should focus on more accessible routes of antibiotic administration, including oral, inhaled, or transdermal formulations.
