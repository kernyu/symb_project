The introduction of telaprevir in the therapeutic armamentarium for hepatitis C virus infection is a major advance, even in patients unresponsive to prior treatment with interferon and ribavirin. In this group of patients, sustained viral response is achieved in more than 80% of those with recurrence and who received triple therapy. In partial responders, more than half achieve cure with the triple combination of pegylated interferon, ribavirin and telaprevir. Unfortunately, the results are less good in null responders, especially given that many are of a certain age and have advanced fibrosis. Patients in this group should be carefully selected to identify those most likely to derive a benefit from triple therapy.
