Biofilm formation is often considered the underlying reason why treatment with an antimicrobial agent fails and as an estimated 65-80% of all human infections is thought to be biofilm-related, this presents a serious challenge. Biofilm model systems are essential to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in biofilm formation and resistance. In this review a comprehensive overview of various in vitro and in vivo systems is presented, and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed.
