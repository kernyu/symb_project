The 2015 represent the deadline for the global tuberculosis (TB) targets set through the Millennium Development Goals (MDG). From 2016 and onward, new goals were set to end the global TB epidemic via implementing new campaign entitled "the End TB Strategy". The major hurdle to end TB epidemic in several parts of the world is the emergence and spread of drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) strains. The better understanding of the actual global burden of drug resistant tuberculosis would feed into better implementing the End TB Strategy. In this article we summarize the current knowledge on the patterns of drug resistance tuberculosis cases in the Middle East countries. These countries are served by the Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office (EMRO), one out of six regional offices of World Health Organization. Middle East countries are characterized by geographic vicinity and population's interaction. However, they are dissimilar in several aspects such as economy and health infrastructures. Regarding economy, countries in this region are ranging from wealthy to very poor. Prevalence of tuberculosis and patterns drug resistance tuberculosis cases are also following variable trends within countries of this region. In almost all Middle East countries, there is under-reporting of drug-resistance tuberculosis cases. There are shortages in the infrastructures and facilities for detecting the pattern of drug-resistance tuberculosis. For instance, sixout of 14 countries have neither in-country capacity nor a linkage with a partner laboratory for second-line drug susceptibility testing and only 4 countries have registered site performing Xpert MTB/RIF.
