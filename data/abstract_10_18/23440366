The aim of this study was to evaluate whether emodin can overcome the chemoresistance of the gemcitabine-resistant cancer cell line (Bxpc-3/Gem) in vitro. The cell line Bxpc-3/Gem was derived from the human pancreatic cancer cell line Bxpc-3. We found that Bxpc-3/Gem cells were characterized by a series of morphological changes with a resistance index of 43.51 comparing with the parental cell line. Emodin reduced Bxpc-3/Gem cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Emodin and gemcitabine combination treatments resulted in decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in Bxpc-3/Gem cells. In addition, combination treatments resulted in downregulation of gene and protein expression of MDR-1 (P-gp), NF-kappaB, XIAP, survivin, as well as inhibition of NF-kappaB activity and P-gp function. These observations suggest that emodin may sensitize the pancreatic cancer gemcitabine-resistant cell line Bxpc-3/Gem to gemcitabine therapy via inhibition of survival signaling.
