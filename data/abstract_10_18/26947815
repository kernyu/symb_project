The central role of inflammation in acne is now more clearly understood. Adapalene, a third-generation topical retinoid, down-regulates toll-like receptor 2 expression and inhibits activator protein-1 activity. In a fixed-dose combination, adapalene and benzoyl peroxide (BPO) act synergistically on inflammatory patterns through regulation of innate immunity. In addition to reducing inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions, adapalene/BPO helps prevent lesion and microcomedone formation. The combination of a topical retinoid and antimicrobial agent remains the preferred approach for almost all patients with acne. In cases of more severe disease, there is a clinical benefit in combining adapalene/BPO with an oral antibiotic for 12 weeks. Most recently, adapalene/BPO plus doxycycline 200 mg was found to be highly effective when compared with isotretinoin in the treatment of patients with severe acne with nodules. Long-term maintenance therapy is needed for most patients. Retinoids are the preferred agents, with BPO added in patients with more severe disease if needed. Adapalene is anticomedogenic, reduces comedones and has anti-inflammatory properties, while BPO is a unique antimicrobial agent not shown to induce microbial resistance after more than 50 years of use. Maintenance therapy for 6 months with adapalene/BPO prevents relapse among patients with severe acne and continues to reduce disease symptoms.
