In this study, we characterised the Salmonella Typhimurium strains responsible for four outbreaks which occurred in distinct rabbit farms (Southern Italy) from 1999 to 2003. Strains were typed by Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) and the genetic basis of antimicrobial resistance was established. A major group of clonally related isolates, pulsotype STYMXB.0061, accounted for three of the salmonellosis foci. Strains were resistant to streptomycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, ampicillin and sulphonamides encoded respectively by the aadA2, floR, tetG, blaPSE-1, sul1 gene cluster harboured by a Salmonella Genomic Island 1. The clonally related group of isolates included strains phage type DT104, DT12 or undefined type (NT). The fourth salmonellosis focus was caused by a strain pulsotype STYMXB.0147, resistant to sulphonamides (encoded by sul2) and phage type U302. Results provided first molecular characterisation of S. Typhimurium strains isolated from rabbit farms in Italy and highlighted the presence of the pulsotype STYMXB.0061 even before its wide detection among human clinical isolates collected in Italy in the mid 2000s from clinical cases.
