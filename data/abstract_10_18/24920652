BACKGROUND: Community-acquired respiratory tract infections (CARTI) are commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPN) and empirically treated with azithromycin. This study assessed clinical cure rates in azithromycin-treated subjects with CARTI caused by azithromycin-susceptible (Azi-S) or azithromycin-resistant (Azi-R) SPN. METHODS: 1127 subjects with CARTI (402 acute otitis media, 309 community-acquired pneumonia, 255 acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and 161 acute bacterial sinusitis) in 13 Phase 3 clinical trials (1993-2007) had a confirmed pathogen, received azithromycin and were assessed for clinical cure/failure. 34.4% of subjects (388/1127) had a positive culture for SPN; 33.4% (376/1127) had Azi-S or Azi-R SPN. RESULTS: 28.9% (112/388) of subjects with SPN had Azi-R SPN: 35.7% (40/112) were low-level Azi-R SPN (LLAR; MIC 2-8 mg/L), while 64.3% (72/112) were high-level Azi-R SPN (HLAR; MIC >/=16 mg/L). Among Azi-S and Azi-R SPN CARTI subjects, clinical cure rates were: 86.2% (324/376) overall; 89.4% (236/264) for subjects with Azi-S SPN; 78.6% (88/112) for subjects with Azi-R SPN (P = 0.003, versus Azi-S); 77.5% (31/40) for subjects with LLAR SPN (P < 0.001); and 79.2% (57/72) for subjects with HLAR SPN (P = 0.122). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical cure rates in CARTI subjects treated with azithromycin were higher for Azi-S SPN (89.4%) versus Azi-R SPN (78.6%; P = 0.003). However, cure rates were not different for subjects infected with LLAR-SPN versus HLAR-SPN. At the observed prevalence of Azi-R SPN of 28.9%, an additional 3.1 clinical failures would be predicted, as a consequence of azithromycin resistance (LLAR and HLAR), per 100 subjects treated empirically with azithromycin.
