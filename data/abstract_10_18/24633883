From the EtOAc-soluble fraction of a MeOH extract of leaves of Cinnamosma fragrans, seven new compounds, including 3,4-seco-24-homo-28-nor-cycloartane, drimane-type sesquiterpenes and their lactams, and two known compounds were isolated. Their structures were elucidated by extensive analyses of spectroscopic data. The cytotoxicity, anti-multidrug resistance activity, and anti-Leishmania activity of a cycloartane derivative and drimane-type sesquiterpene derivatives were assayed. The cycloartane derivative showed strong cytotoxicity, and some drimanes and drimane lactam showed moderate anti-multidrug resistance and anti-Leishmania activity.
