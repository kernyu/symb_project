The antitumor agent actinomycin D has been used in the treatment of Wilms tumor for the past 40 years. Actinomycin D-induced hepatopathy-thrombocytopenia syndrome (HTS) is characterized as a rare syndrome. The mechanism underlying HTS may differ with individual multidrug resistance protein-1 (MDR1) genotype. The relationship between actinomycin D-related HTS and MDR1 gene mutations is presented in this case study of a pediatric patient with Wilms tumor. Our findings revealed that the girl had (-)1G>A, 1236C>T, 2677G>T, 3435C>T, and 61A>G MDR1 gene mutations. Understanding the function of genetic variants of MDR1 is an important aim for personalized cancer management.
