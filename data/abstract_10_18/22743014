In 2010, a total of 1327 clinical Escherichia coli isolates from five hospitals in the Kyoto and Shiga regions of Japan were analysed by PCR. The prevalences of plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase (pAmpC)-producers, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producers and co-producers of pAmpC and ESBL were 1.7%, 9.7% and 0.3%, respectively. Less than one-half of the pAmpC-producers were reported to be resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, cephamycins and beta-lactam/beta-lactam inhibitors using the old 2009 Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) breakpoints. CMY-2 was the most prevalent pAmpC type (95%), and CTX-M-14 (38%), CTX-M-15 (26%) and CTX-M-27 (19%) were the most prevalent ESBL types. The worldwide O25b-ST131-B2 clone accounted for 11% of pAmpC-producers and 41% of ESBL-producers. The O25b-ST131-B2 clone was characterised by a CTX-M-27- or CTX-M-15-type ESBL and ciprofloxacin-non-susceptibility with quadruple mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions (S83L and D87N in GyrA and S80I and E84V in ParC). A significant proportion of pAmpC-producers and the O25b-ST131-B2 clone were found in Japan by a recent regional surveillance programme.
