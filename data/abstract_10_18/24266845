Bacteriophage is bacterial virus widespread in the biosphere. Bacteriophages and their encoded endolysin (or lysin), holin, and other small proteins are intensively pursed as novel therapeutic agents to complement and tackle the increasing antibiotics resistance. Moreover, the delivery system based on bacteriophage and the diagnostic method based on engineered bacteriophage were also promising new avenues to drug delivery and diagnosis.
