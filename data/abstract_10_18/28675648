Advanced methods for preventing and controlling hospital-acquired infections via eradication of free-floating bacteria and bacterial biofilms are of great interest. In this regard, the attractiveness of unconventional treatment modalities such as antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) continues to grow. This study investigated a new and innovative strategy for targeting polysaccharides found on the bacterial cell envelope and the biofilm matrix using the boronic acid functionalized and highly effective photosensitizer (PS) silicon(IV) phthalocyanine. This strategy has been found to be successful in treating planktonic cultures and biofilms of Gram-negative E. coli. An additional advantage of boronic acid functionality is a possibility to anchor the tailor made PS to poly(vinyl alcohol) and to fabricate a self-disinfecting coating.
