HCV is a worldwide disease with an estimated prevalence by WHO of 3%. Hepatitis C virus 4 is prevalent in Africa and the Middle East, especially Egypt. The treatment of HCV4 is affected by many factors, related to the virus itself (genotype, pretreatment viral load and prevalent quasispecies), to the host (genetic factors, age, ethnicity and liver histology), to the presence of comorbidities (obesity, insulin resistance and co-infections) and to the therapeutic drugs (type, dose and duration). Optimizing treatment is the goal of daily practice to obtain the best results for the patient.
