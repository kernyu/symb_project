Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive cancers with a median survival time (MST) of <6 months in chemotherapy-resistant patients. Therefore, the development of novel treatment modalities is needed. In the present study, a phase II study of personalized peptide vaccination (PPV) was conducted, in which vaccine antigens were selected and administered based on the pre-existing IgG responses to 31 different pooled peptides, for 41 chemotherapy-resistant advanced pancreatic cancer patients. No vaccine-related severe adverse events were observed. IgG responses specific to at least one of the vaccine peptides were augmented in 14 of 36 patients (39%) and in 18 of 19 patients (95%) tested after the 5th and 11th vaccination, respectively. MST from the first vaccination was 7.9 months with a 1-year survival rate of 26.8%. Higher serum amyloid A (SAA) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in pre-vaccination plasma were unfavorable factors for overall survival (OS). Due to the safety profile and the potential clinical efficacy, the conduction of additional clinical trials of PPV for chemotherapy-resistant advanced pancreatic cancer patients is warranted.
