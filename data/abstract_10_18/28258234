We are facing a potential catastrophe of untreatable bacterial infections, driven by the inexorable rise of extensively drug-resistant bacteria, coupled with a market failure of pharmaceutical and biotech companies to deliver new therapeutic options. While global recognition of the problem is finally apparent, solutions are still a long way from being implemented. In addition to drug stewardship programmes and better diagnostics, new antibiotics are desperately needed. The question remains as to how to achieve this goal. This review will examine the different strategies being applied to discover new antibiotics.
