A carbapenemase-producing Enterobacter cloacae hhy03 with a blaNDM-1 and blaSHV-12-coharboring plasmid was isolated from a sputum specimen of a patient. This is the third nucleotide sequence report of blaNDM-1-harboring plasmid from Enterobacter cloacae that have caused lethal infections in China, indicating the spread of NDM-1 by IncX3 plasmid between Enterobacteriaceae.
