The threat of antibiotic resistant bacteria has called for alternative antimicrobial strategies that would mitigate the increase of classical resistance mechanism. Many bacteria employ quorum sensing (QS) to govern the production of virulence factors and formation of drug-resistant biofilms. Targeting the mechanism of QS has proven to be a functional alternative to conventional antibiotic control of infections. However, the presence of multiple QS systems in individual bacterial species poses a challenge to this approach. Quorum sensing inhibitors (QSI) and quorum quenching enzymes (QQE) have been both investigated for their QS interfering capabilities. Here, we first simulated the combination effect of QQE and QSI in blocking bacterial QS. The effect was next validated by experiments using AiiA as QQE and G1 as QSI on Pseudomonas aeruginosa LasR/I and RhlR/I QS circuits. Combination of QQE and QSI almost completely blocked the P. aeruginosa las and rhl QS systems. Our findings provide a potential chemical biology application strategy for bacterial QS disruption.
