2-Hydroxy fatty acids (2-HFAs) are predominantly present in sphingolipids and have important physicochemical and physiological functions in eukaryotic cells. Recent studies from our group demonstrated that sphingolipid fatty acid 2-hydroxylase (FAH) is required for the function of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) Bax inhibitor-1 (AtBI-1), which is an endoplasmic reticulum membrane-localized cell death suppressor. However, little is known about the function of two Arabidopsis FAH homologs (AtFAH1 and AtFAH2), and it remains unclear whether 2-HFAs participate in cell death regulation. In this study, we found that both AtFAH1 and AtFAH2 had FAH activity, and the interaction with Arabidopsis cytochrome b(5) was needed for the sufficient activity. 2-HFA analysis of AtFAH1 knockdown lines and atfah2 mutant showed that AtFAH1 mainly 2-hydroxylated very-long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA), whereas AtFAH2 selectively 2-hydroxylated palmitic acid in Arabidopsis. In addition, 2-HFAs were related to resistance to oxidative stress, and AtFAH1 or 2-hydroxy VLCFA showed particularly strong responses to oxidative stress. Furthermore, AtFAH1 interacted with AtBI-1 via cytochrome b(5) more preferentially than AtFAH2. Our results suggest that AtFAH1 and AtFAH2 are functionally different FAHs, and that AtFAH1 or 2-hydroxy VLCFA is a key factor in AtBI-1-mediated cell death suppression.
