INTRODUCTION: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a problematic pathogen in both outpatient and inpatient settings. Research to optimize the dosing of these agents is needed to slow the development of antimicrobial resistance and to decrease the likelihood of clinical failure. Areas covered: This review summarizes the available data for orally administered antimicrobials routinely used as monotherapy for MRSA infections. We make recommendations and highlight the current gaps in the literature. A PubMed (1966 - Present) search was performed to identify relevant literature for this review. Expert commentary: There is a vast divide in the amount of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data to guide dosing decisions for older MRSA agents compared with the oxazolidenones. Five-year view: Additional retrospective data will become available for the older MRSA agents in severe MRSA infections.
