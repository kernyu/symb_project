The aim of the present study is to investigate the types of healthcare-associated infections (HC-AIs) caused by Acinetobacter baumannii and the related antibiotic susceptibility patterns as well as the genotypic characteristics of the Acinetobacter baumannii isolates from our center. Sixty-nine Acinetobacter baumannii isolates originating from various samples collected from 69 pediatric patients during their hospital stays were included in the study. The types of healthcare-associated infections caused by these isolates were evaluated, and the antibiotic susceptibility pattern and the genotypic characteristics of the isolates were determined using the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) method. Fifty of the 69 children were observed to have HC-AIs, and 19 children had Acinetobacter baumannii colonization. Healthcare-associated pneumonia (58%) was the most common type of these infections. The rate of carbapenem resistance was found as 91.3%, while tigecycline resistance was found as 18.84%. No colistin resistance was observed in any of the isolates. A total of 10 groups, comprising eight major and two minor groups, were determined using the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis method. Acinetobacter baumannii isolates are the leading cause of healthcare-associated infections, and they show high rates of multidrug antibiotic resistance. Molecular epidemiological evaluation using PFGE plays an important role in preventing healthcare-associated infections.
