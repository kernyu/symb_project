INTRODUCTION: The main emerging resistance mechanism relating to Enterobacteriaceae is represented by production of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). These enzymes have the capacity to hydrolyze broad-spectrum cephalosporins and are greatly used for antimicrobial chemotherapy on enterobacterial infections. Although resistance to these agents presents remarkable geographical variability, the resistance rates are high in many countries METHODS: A retrospective observational cross-sectional descriptive study was developed to evaluate the frequency of ESBLs among Enterobacteriaceae strains obtained from Hospital Sao Vicente de Paulo, Brazil RESULTS: ESBL production was noted in 24.8% (n = 208/838) of the isolates evaluated. Isolates of Escherichia coli represented 46.2% (n = 96/208) of the ESBL producers, followed by Enterobacter species (30.3%; n = 63/208). The sensitivity of these isolates to meropenem was 91.4% and to piperacillin/tazobactam, 67.4% CONCLUSIONS: The ESBL levels founded confirm the worldwide concern regarding this resistance mechanism.
