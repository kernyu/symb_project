The phytochemical analysis of the root bark extracts of the Chilean Maytenus, M. chubutensis, and M. magellanica (Celastraceae), led to the isolation of one phenolic nortriterpene, 1, and one diterpene with a nor-ent-kaurene skeleton, 2. In addition, four known compounds were isolated, among which compound 3 has been isolated for the first time from a natural source. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic methods, including 1D- and 2D-NMR (COSY, ROESY, HSQC, and HMBC) experiments, comparison with data reported in the literature, and chemical correlations. The isolated compounds were assayed for their reversal activity against a multidrug-resistant Leishmania tropica line, overexpressing a P-glycoprotein related transporter. Compound 1 showed moderate multidrug-resistance reversal activity.
