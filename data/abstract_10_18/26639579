The persistence of the multi-drug resistance plasmids pAQU1 and IncFIB was examined in bacterial populations under very low selective pressure. We herein demonstrated that these plasmids stably remained not only in the original host, but also in a transconjugant, even after being in a non-culturable state. In seawater microcosms containing Photobacterium damselae 04Ya311 possessing pAQU1, no significant loss of pAQU1 was observed during a 30-d starvation period. The copy numbers of pAQU1 and IncFIB in E. coli were constant. The results of the present study suggest that these plasmids have the ability to remain among various bacteria under oligotrophic conditions with low antibiotic selection pressure.
