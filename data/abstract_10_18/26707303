OBJECTIVE: Acinetobacter baumannii has become a major problem among solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution, drug resistance, and clinical characteristics of A baumannii infections in SOT recipients. METHODS: We retrospectively identified 78/1,850 (4.2%) SOT recipients who developed A baumannii infections from January 1, 2003, to April 1, 2015, and evaluated the distribution, drug resistance, and clinical characteristics of these infections. RESULTS: Over the study period, 101 episodes of A baumannii infection occurred in 78 SOT recipients, with respiratory tract (37.6%) and blood (35.6%) as the most common sites of infection. Fifty-six episodes of A baumannii infection were accompanied with a serum creatinine level of >1.5 mg/dL. Multidrug resistance (MDR) or extensive drug resistance (XDR) occurred in 83.2%. Antibiotic resistance rate of all A baumannii to 8 of 9 antibiotics investigated was >50%. Seventy-eight percent of A baumannii were carbapenem-resistant. All but one A baumannii isolates tested against polymyxin B were susceptible. There were 40 (51.3%) overall in-hospital deaths and 31 (39.7%) infection-related deaths. CONCLUSIONS: A baumannii infections are associated with high morbidity and mortality in SOT recipients, and MDR or XDR is common. Prevention measures are essential, and combination therapy of antibiotics are needed to improve the outcomes of SOT recipients with A baumannii infections.
