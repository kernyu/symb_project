A cross sectional study was conducted in Services Hospital, Lahore using a self administered questionnaire to test the knowledge, attitude and prescribing practices of residents and attending physicians using non-probability convenience sampling. A total of 116 questionnaires were filled (Response rate=77.3%). Knowledge was below average (mean score of 3.66+/-1.1). Only 18 physicians (16%) could correctly estimate the rates of resistance of Klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa to cephalosporin. Mostly physicians reviewed their decisions to prescribe an antibiotic by discussing with a senior colleague (n=93; 80%). When they did, the senior colleague sometimes recommended a different antibiotic (n=106; 91%). Seventy seven physicians (66%) reported that they prescribed more than one antibiotic per day. Physicians also stated that their decision of antimicrobial prescription was influenced by patient's socioeconomic status (n=108; 93.1%) and patients' demands (n=24; 20.7%). This study highlighted the importance of Antimicrobial stewardship and revealed topics to address during future antimicrobial prescribing interventions such as dissemination of information about local resistance rates and encouraging knowledge about antimicrobials.
