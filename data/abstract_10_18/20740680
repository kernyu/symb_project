Effects of the commercial drug zanamivir (Relenza) covalently attached to poly-l-glutamine on the infectivity of influenza A viruses are examined using the plaque reduction assay and binding affinity to viral neuraminidase (NA). These multivalent drug conjugates exhibit (i) up to a 20,000-fold improvement in anti-influenza potency compared with the zanamivir parent against human and avian viral strains, including both wild-type and drug-resistant mutants, and (ii) superior neuraminidase (NA) inhibition constants, especially for the mutants. These findings provide a basis for exploring polymer-attached inhibitors as more efficacious therapeutics, particularly against drug-resistant influenza strains.
