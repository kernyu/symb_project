We describe a large hospital outbreak (93 bloodstream infections) of colistin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae isolates which was mirrored by increased colistin consumption. The outbreak was mostly traced to the clonal expansion of an mgrB deletion mutant of an ST512 strain that produced KPC-3.
