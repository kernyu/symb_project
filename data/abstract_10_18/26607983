We evaluated an immunochromatographic lateral flow assay to detect OXA-48-like carbapenemases (OXA-48 K-SeT) in Enterobacteriaceae (n = 82). One hundred percent sensitivity and specificity were observed using bacteria recovered from both solid medium and spiked blood culture bottles, and the results were obtained in <10 min.
