There has been a global upsurge in fungal infections due to rise in immunodeficiencies, debilitation and situations of violated anatomical barriers. The available antifungal repertoire has limited activity and is fraught with toxicity concerns. Drug resistance has also shown a rapid upward trend. This has resulted in increased treatment failures, mortality and health care costs. Novel effective and safe antimycotics are needed. Analogues of existing antifungal compounds and new molecules are being developed. New targets are being explored for their putative role in curtailing fungal infections. Newer antigens as vaccine candidates are being researched into. Focused efforts in this direction have yielded encouraging results. This review illuminates the various antifungal strategies which hold promise for the future.
