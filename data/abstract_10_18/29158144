Infections due to multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDR) are currently a clinical challenge, mainly in elderly patients. The antimicrobial spectrum, safety and efficacy of ceftolozane/tazobactam (C/T) make it an attractive option for the treatment of MDR bacterial infections beyond the indications approved to date. Here we report our experience with C/T in four cases of osteomyelitis and three cases of skin and soft-tissue infections due to extensively-drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
