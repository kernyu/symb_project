The cyclic lipopeptide Daptomycin, used as a treatment for infections where antimicrobial resistance is observed, is shown to self-assemble into spherical micelles above a critical aggregation concentration. Micelles are observed either in the absence or presence of CaCl2 , in contrast to claims in the literature that CaCl2 is required for micellization.
