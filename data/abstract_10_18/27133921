Microarray-based serogenotyping, antimicrobial susceptibility tests and the detection of relevant resistance genes were performed on isolates of Salmonella spp. from retail meat samples obtained in Lagos, Nigeria. Out of 151 meat samples, 33 Salmonella isolates were obtained. Nine different Salmonella serovars (S. Amoutive, S. Bargny, S. Drac, S. Ealing, S. Urbana, S. Hadar, S. Nyborg, S. Anatum and S. Havana) were identified by microarray-based serogenotyping and confirmed afterwards using classical serotyping. Antibiotic susceptibility tests with 17 antibiotics showed that almost all isolates were fully susceptible to this panel. The results of this study indicated a high prevalence of Salmonella in retail meat, the presence of some previously rather rarely described Serovars in retail meat samples from Lagos, and a need to monitor for Salmonella and their antibiotic resistance determinants. The microarray-based system used herein proved to be perfectly suited as epidemiological tool to replace classical serotyping.
