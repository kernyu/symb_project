Standardized definitions for MDR are currently not available in veterinary medicine despite numerous reports indicating that antimicrobial resistance may be increasing among clinically significant bacteria in livestock and companion animals. As such, assessments of MDR presented in veterinary scientific reports are inconsistent. Herein, we apply previously standardized definitions for MDR, XDR and pandrug resistance (PDR) used in human medicine to animal pathogens and veterinary antimicrobial agents in which MDR is defined as an isolate that is not susceptible to at least one agent in at least three antimicrobial classes, XDR is defined as an isolate that is not susceptible to at least one agent in all but one or two available classes and PDR is defined as an isolate that is not susceptible to all agents in all available classes. These definitions may be applied to antimicrobial agents used to treat bovine respiratory disease (BRD) caused by Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida and Histophilus somni and swine respiratory disease (SRD) caused by Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, P. multocida and Streptococcus suis, as well as antimicrobial agents used to treat canine skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) caused by Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species. Application of these definitions in veterinary medicine should be considered static, whereas the classification of a particular resistance phenotype as MDR, XDR or PDR could change over time as more veterinary-specific clinical breakpoints or antimicrobial classes and/or agents become available in the future.
