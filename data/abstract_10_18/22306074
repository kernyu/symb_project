Recently suitability of crude glycerol for trehalose and propionic acid productions was reported using Propionibacterium freudenreichii subspp. shermanii and it was concluded that presence of KCl in crude glycerol was the probable reason for higher trehalose accumulation with crude glycerol medium. To further improve trehalose production, an osmotic sensitive mutant of this strain (non-viable in medium with 3% NaCl) with higher trehalose yield was isolated. In mutant, trehalose yields achieved with respect to biomass and substrate consumed (391 mg/g of biomass, 90 mg/g of substrate consumed) were three and four times higher, respectively as compared to parent strain when crude glycerol was used as a carbon source. Other major fermentation products obtained were propionic acid (0.42 g/g of substrate consumed) and lactic acid (0.3g/g of substrate consumed). It was also observed that in mutant higher activity of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase was probably responsible for higher trehalose accumulation.
