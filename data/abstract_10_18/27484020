To give an indication of a fitness cost conferred by FKS mutation-associated echinocandin resistance in Candida glabrata during human infection. Six C. glabrata clinical strains sequentially isolated from blood and a hepatic abscess in a solid organ transplant recipient were analysed. The patient had received long-term azole and echinocandin therapy for invasive aspergillosis and persistent candidaemia. Minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) broth microdilution method. Molecular mechanisms of antifungal resistance were determined by sequencing hot spots of the FKS. Strain relatedness was determined using a microsatellite-based typing method. Typing analysis revealed an identical microsatellite pattern for all isolates, supporting a close relation. The first C. glabrata isolate showed wild-type phenotype (i.e. susceptibility to echinocandins and low level of azole resistance). After voriconazole therapy, the C. glabrata quickly acquired pan-azole resistance. Later, echinocandin treatment led to the emergence of a FKS2 S663P alteration and echinocandin resistance. After disruption of both azole and echinocandin therapy in favour of liposomal amphotericin B, C. glabrata isolates regained full susceptibility to echinocandin and lost the FKS2 S663P alteration while nonetheless maintaining their pan-azole resistance. Our clinical report supports the potential existence of a fitness cost conferred by FKS mutation in C. glabrata, as disruption of treatment led to a rapid disappearance of the resistant clone. This suggests that a more restricted use and/or a discontinuous administration of echinocandins may limit the spread of clinical resistance to this class.
