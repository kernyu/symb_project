Drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia (DITP) can be triggered by a wide range of medications. Although many cases of DITP are mild, some are characterised by life-threatening bleeding symptoms. In the treatment of tuberculosis there are special therapeutic problems related to adverse effects of drugs, compliance to treatment and microbial resistance. Thrombocytopenia is an uncommon but potentially fatal adverse effect of certain antituberculous drugs when the incriminating drug is taken by a susceptible individual. Here the authors report a case of rifampicin-induced thrombocytopenia, which although rare, needs attention.
