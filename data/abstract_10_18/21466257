We determined minimum inhibitory concentrations of rifampicin, nitrofurantoin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, and cefdinir, plus a combination of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cefdinir by broth microdilution for mainly wound isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. E. coli and K. pneumoniae susceptibilities increased by combining amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cefdinir.
