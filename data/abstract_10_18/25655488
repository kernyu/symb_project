Guided tissue regeneration is a technique used for periodontium reconstruction. This technique uses barrier membranes, which prevent epithelial growth in the wound site and may also be used to release antibiotics, to protect the wound against opportunistic infections. Periodontal poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) membranes containing metronidazole (a drug used to help in infection control) were produced and characterized. The kinetic mechanism of the metronidazole delivery of leached and nonleached membrane as well as its cytotoxicity and structural integrity were evaluated. Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) membranes containing 0.5-2 wt % of the drug and 20 wt % of the plasticizer were manufactured via compression molding. Based on morphological analysis, membranes loaded with 2% metronidazole were considered for detailed studies. The results revealed that metronidazole delivery by the leached membranes seemed to follow the Fick's law. Membranes were noncytotoxic. The amount of metronidazole delivered was in the range of the minimal inhibitory concentration for Porphyromonas gingivalis, and the membranes inhibited the proliferation of these bacteria. Besides, they maintained their mechanical resistance after 30 days of immersion in phosphate buffer at pH 7.4.
