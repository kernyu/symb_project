Biofilms are complex microbial associations anchored to abiotic or biotic surfaces, embedded in extracellular matrix produced by the biofilms themselves where they interact with each other and the environment. One of the main properties of biofilms is their capacity to be more resistant to antimicrobial agents than planktonic cells. Efflux pumps have been reported as one of the mechanisms responsible for the antimicrobial resistance in biofilm structures. Evidence of the role of efflux pump in biofilm resistance has been found in several microorganisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans. However, in spite of the studies on the importance of efflux pumps in biofilm growth and about their relevance in antimicrobial resistance forming biofilm, the exact role of these efflux systems has not been determined as yet.
