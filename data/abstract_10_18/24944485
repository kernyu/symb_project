AIM: To investigate moxifloxacin-containing triple therapy as second-line treatment for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection following failed first-line treatment. METHODS: The sample included 312 patients for whom first-line treatment failed between January 2008 and May 2013; 27 patients were excluded, and a total of 285 patients received 7- or 14-d moxifloxacin-containing triple therapy as second-line treatment for H. pylori infection. First line regimens included 7-d standard triple (n = 172), 10-d bismuth-containing quadruple (n = 28), 14-d concomitant (n = 37), or 14-d sequential (n = 48) therapy. H. pylori status was evaluated using (13)C-urea breath testing 4 wk later, after completion of the treatment. The primary outcome was the H. pylori eradication rate analyzed using intention-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) analyses. The secondary outcome was the occurrence of serious adverse events. Demographic and clinical factors were analyzed using Student's t-tests and Pearson's chi(2) tests according to first- and second-line regimens. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The eradication rate of moxifloxacin-containing triple therapy was 68.4% (ITT; 95%CI: 62.8-73.5) and 73.9% (PP; 95%CI: 68.3-78.8). The eradication rate was significantly higher with 14 d compared to 7 d of treatment (77.5% vs 62.5%, P = 0.017). Peptic ulcer patients had a higher eradication rate than the patients without ulcers (82.9% vs 70.6%, P = 0.046). The demographic and clinical characteristics were not significantly different between the groups according to first-line therapies. ITT and PP analyses of the moxifloxacin-containing triple therapy indicated the following eradication rates: 70.9% (95%CI: 63.8-77.2) and 77.2% (95%CI: 70.1-83.1) for standard triple; 67.9% (95%CI: 51.5-84.2) and 67.9% (95%CI: 51.5-84.2) for bismuth-containing quadruple; 60.4% (95%CI: 46.3-73.0) and 70.7% (95%CI: 54.0-80.9) for sequential; and 67.6% (95%CI: 51.5-80.4) and 67.6%(95%CI: 51.5-80.4) for concomitant therapy. There were no statistically significant differences in the efficacy of the first-line regimens (P = 0.492). The most common adverse event was diarrhea. There were no serious adverse events and no significant differences in the frequency of side effects between the first- and second-line regimens (28.7% vs 26.1%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Moxifloxacin-containing triple therapy as second-line treatment resulted in low eradication rates. There were no differences in the efficacy between the first-line regimens in South Korea.
