Remnant specimens from 601 women obtained in a cross-sectional study from rural South Africa were tested for Mycoplasma genitalium. Overall, 10.8% of women were infected with M. genitalium either in the vagina or in the rectum. Macrolide resistance, although of low prevalence, in M. genitalium is described for the first time in Sub-Saharan Africa.
