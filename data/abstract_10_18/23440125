This study describes a carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) outbreak that occurred from October 2008-December 2010. Polymerase chain reaction assays were performed to detect the blaKPC gene and molecular typing was performed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). There were 33 CRKP infections; PFGE revealed five genotypes: genotype A in five (15%), B in 18 (55%), C in eight (24%) and two unique profiles. Genotype B was disseminated in all hospital units and belonged to the same clone identified in 11 different hospitals in the state of Sao Paulo. Sixteen (48%) patients died. Seven isolates (21%) were resistant to polymyxin B and 45% were resistant to tigecycline and amikacin.
