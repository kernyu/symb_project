STUDY HYPOTHESIS: Is it possible to immunologically activate human cervical epithelial cells to produce antiviral factors that inhibit herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) replication? STUDY FINDING: Our results indicate that human cervical epithelial cells possess a functional TLR3/RIG-I signaling system, the activation of which can mount an Interferon-lambda (IFN-lambda)-mediated anti-HSV-2 response. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: There is limited information about the role of cervical epithelial cells in genital innate immunity against HSV-2 infection. STUDY DESIGN, SAMPLES/MATERIALS, METHODS: We examined the expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible I (RIG-I) in End1/E6E7 cells by real-time PCR. The IFN-lambda induced by TLR3 and RIG-I activation of End1/E6E7 cells was also examined by real-time PCR and ELISA. HSV-2 infection of End1/E6E7 cells was evaluated by the real-time PCR detection of HSV-2 gD expression. The antibody to IL-10Rbeta was used to determine whether IFN-lambda contributes to TLR3/RIG-I mediated HSV-2 inhibition. Expression of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), IRF7, IFN-stimulated gene 56 (ISG56), 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase I (OAS-1) and myxovirus resistance A (MxA) were determined by the real-time PCR and western blot. End1/E6E7 cells were transfected with shRNA to knockdown the IRF3, IRF7 or RIG-I expression. Student's t-test and post Newman-Keuls test were used to analyze stabilized differences in the immunological parameters above between TLR3/RIG-I-activated cells and control cells. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Human cervical epithelial cells expressed functional TLR3 and RIG-I, which could be activated by poly I:C and 5'ppp double-strand RNAs (5'ppp dsRNA), resulting in the induction of endogenous interferon lambda (IFN-lambda). The induced IFN-lambda contributed to TLR3/RIG-I-mediated inhibition of HSV-2 replication in human cervical epithelial cells, as an antibody to IL-10Rbeta, an IFN-lambda receptor subunit, could compromise TLR3/RIG-I-mediated inhibition of HSV-2. Further studies showed that TLR3/RIG-I signaling in the cervical epithelial cells by dsRNA induced the expression of the IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), ISG56, 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase I (OAS-1) and myxovirus resistance A (MxA), the key antiviral elements in the IFN signaling pathway. In addition, we observed that the topical treatment of genital mucosa with poly I:C could protect mice from genital HSV-2 infection. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Future prospective studies with primary cells and suitable animal models are needed in order to confirm these outcomes. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The findings provide direct and compelling evidence that there is intracellular expression and regulation of IFN-lambda in human cervical epithelial cells, which may have a key role in the innate genital protection against viral infections.
