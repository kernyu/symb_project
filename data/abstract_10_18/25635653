This study was carried out to investigate the biomedicinal potential of a bioactive marker component, butyryl alkannin, isolated from n-hexane root extract of Arnebia euchroma against various vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) isolates of Enterococcus faecalis causing urinary tract infections. As a result, butyryl alkannin showed significant antibacterial activity against multidrug-resistant E. faecalis pathogens of VRE as minimum inhibitory concentration values which were found in the range of 3.13 to 6.26 mug ml(-1). The findings of this study justify biological and biomedicinal potential of butyryl alkannin compound as confirmed by its higher and significant antibacterial efficacy against VRE isolates of E. faecalis as compared to standard antibiotic vancomycin.
