A lysozyme-chitosan conjugate preparation (LYZOX), produced from egg white lysozyme and chitosan by Maillard reaction, is a commercial product developed as a cosmetic ingredient or food additive. Effects of LYZOX on in vitro growth of Candida albicans were examined. C. albicans cells were treated with LYZOX for 3 hrs, and then washed and cultured for an additional 16 hrs in modified RPMI1640 medium. Mycelial growth of C. albicans was clearly inhibited by more than 100 mug/ml of LYZOX in a concentration-dependent manner. On the other hand, corresponding concentration of chitosan or lysozyme or their mixture only scarcely showed clear inhibitory effect. Similarly, anti-Candida activity of the combination of LYZOX and decanoic acid, a middle-chain fatty acid, was also examined. Inhibitory activity of this combination against mycelial growth of C. albicans was very potent and appeared synergistic, since fractionated inhibitory concentration (FIC) index for 70% growth inhibition was calculated to be 0.20. Oral application of this combination improved the symptoms of Candida-infected-tongue in an experimental murine candidiasis model. On the basis of these results, the possible application of LYZOX as a new functional product with anti-candida activity was discussed.
