We described the synthesis of a new congener series of 1,2,3-triazolyl-4-oxoquinolines and evaluated their ability to inhibit oseltamivir (OST)-resistant influenza strains. Oxoquinoline derivative 1i was the most potent compound within this series, inhibiting 94% of wild-type (WT) influenza neuraminidase (NA) activity. Compound 1i inhibited influenza virus replication with an EC50 of 0.2muM with less cytotoxicity than OST, and also inhibited different OST-resistant NAs. These results suggest that 1,2,3-triazolyl-4-oxoquinolines represent promising lead molecules for further anti-influenza drug design.
