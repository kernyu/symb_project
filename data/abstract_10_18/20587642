BACKGROUND: Childhood tuberculosis (TB) represents a sentinel event of recent transmission and is an indication of the effectiveness of prevention and control interventions. We analysed the trends in the epidemiology of TB in children in London aged 0-14 years between 1999 and 2006. METHODS: Data were extracted from the Enhanced TB Surveillance System. RESULTS: Between 1999 and 2006, there were 1370 cases of TB in children. Incidence was higher in older children and in girls. The incidence rates in London Boroughs varied from 0.4/100,000 to 32.7/100,000. Between 1999 and 2006, Black-Africans comprised 49.2% of all TB cases in children, children from the Indian Subcontinent 21.8% and Whites 8.5%. The proportion of cases born in the UK averaged 52.4% during this period. Of non-UK-born children 79.3% were diagnosed with TB within 5 years of entry. CONCLUSIONS: Ethnicity, country of birth and age are important risk factors for development of. With an overall TB incidence in London exceeding 40/100,000, universal BCG immunization of all neonates should be considered across all London boroughs.
