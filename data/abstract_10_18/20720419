BACKGROUND: A mass Entamoeba histolytica infection recurred despite repeated treatments with metronidazole at a rehabilitation institution for individuals with intellectual impairments. METHODS: Diloxanide furoate was administered to improve intractable intestinal amoebiasis after a recurring amoebic infection that tends to occur via coprophagy in mentally disabled individuals infected with E. histolytica at an institution (the prevalence rate and positive serology rate were 38.2 and 67.1%, respectively). The therapeutic effect of the drugs was judged by microscopic stool examination and an E. histolytica antigen detection kit. RESULTS: The mass infection was eliminated through the administration of metronidazole and subsequent use of diloxanide furoate. CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy successfully cured and prevented transmission of the mass E. histolytica infection at the institution.
