Acinetobacter bereziniae (formerly Acinetobacter genomospecies 10) isolate Nec was recovered from a skin sample of a patient hospitalized in Paris, France. It was resistant to penicillins, penicillin-inhibitor combinations, and carbapenems. Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli identified the carbapenem-hydrolyzing class D beta-lactamase OXA-229, which is weakly related to other oxacillinases (66% amino acid identity with the closest oxacillinase, OXA-58). It hydrolyzed penicillins, oxacillin, and imipenem but not expanded-spectrum cephalosporins. Sequencing of the genetic context of the bla(OXA-229) gene did not identify an insertion sequence but did identify mutations in the promoter sequences in comparison to the fully susceptible A. bereziniae reference strain. The overexpression of bla(OXA-229) in A. bereziniae Nec as a source of carbapenem resistance was identified by quantitative real-time PCR.
