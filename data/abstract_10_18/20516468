PURPOSE: The pharmacology, antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, clinical efficacy, safety, and place in therapy of ceftobiprole are reviewed. SUMMARY: Ceftobiprole, a novel, broad-spectrum, parenteral cephalosporin, inhibits the cell-wall synthesis of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) PBP2a and PBP2x, responsible for the resistance in staphylococci and pneumococci, respectively. Ceftobiprole has good activity against gram-positive aerobes and anaerobes, and its activity against gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes is species dependent. Ceftobiprole is relatively inactive against Acinetobacter species. Its ability to bind relevant PBPs of resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria indicates its potential use in the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia and complicated skin and skin-structure infections (cSSSIs). Ceftobiprole is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys and exhibits linear pharmacokinetics. The half-life of the drug is approximately 3-4 hours. It exhibits minimal plasma protein binding (16%). Ceftobiprole does not inhibit the cytochrome P-450 isoenzyme system, so the possibility of drug-drug interactions is low. The drug has not been approved for use in the United States but has been approved in Canada and elsewhere. Ceftobiprole is currently undergoing Phase III clinical trials and has demonstrated activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Completed Phase III trials used i.v. dosages of 500 mg every 8-12 hours. The most commonly observed adverse effects of ceftobiprole included headache and gastrointestinal upset. CONCLUSION: Ceftobiprole is a novel, broad-spectrum, parenteral cephalosporin undergoing Phase III clinical trials. Its broad spectrum of activity makes it a candidate for monotherapy of cSSSIs and pneumonias that have required combination therapy in the past.
