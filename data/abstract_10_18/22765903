The synthesis of a Microcystis aeruginosa predicted metabolite analog of aerucyclamide B was performed. This hexacyclopeptide was obtained from three heterocyclic building blocks by a convergent macrocycle-assembly methodology. The compound exhibited good in vitro antiplasmodial activity (IC(50): 0.18 muM, K1, cholorquine resistant strain).
