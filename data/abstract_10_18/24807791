There is no consensus on optimal screening procedures for multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (MDRE) in intensive care units (ICUs). Therefore, we assessed five strategies for the detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and high-level expressed AmpC cephalosporinase (HL-CASE) producers. During a 3-month period, a rectal screening swab sample was collected daily from every ICU patient, from the first 24 h to the last day of ICU stay. Samples were plated on MDRE-selective media. Bacteria were identified using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and antibiograms were performed using disk diffusion. MDREs were isolated from 682/2348 (29.0%) screening samples collected from 93/269 (34.6%) patients. Incidences of patients with ESBL and HL-CASE producers were 17.8 and 19.3 per 100 admissions, respectively. In 48/93 patients, MDRE carriage was intermittent. Compared with systematic screening at admission, systematic screening at discharge did not significantly increase the rate of MDRE detection among the 93 patients (62% vs. 70%). In contrast, screening at admission and discharge, screening at admission and weekly thereafter, and screening at admission and weekly thereafter and at discharge significantly increased MDRE detection (77%, p 0.02; 76%, p 0.01; 86%, p<0.001, respectively). The difference in MDRE detection between these strategies relies essentially on the levels of detection of patients with HL-CASE producers. The most reasonable strategy would be to collect two samples, one at admission and one at discharge, which would detect 87.5% of the ESBL strains, 67.3% of the HL-CASE strains and 77.4% of all MDRE strains. This study should facilitate decision-making concerning the most suitable screening policy for MDRE detection in a given ICU setting.
