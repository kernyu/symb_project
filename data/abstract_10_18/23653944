The paper gives an update on the efficiency of Helicobacter pylori eradication. Triple therapy (a proton pump inhibitor + clarithromycin + amoxicillin) therapy is shown to hold top positions as first-line therapy for H. pylori eradication as before. The leading second-line therapy regimens are quadruple and 10-day triple schemes including levofloxacin. This point of view is supported by the Russian Gastroenterology Association. To reduce an increase in H. pylori resistance to clarithromycin, it is advisable to use Klacid (generic name: clarithromycin) in the eradication schemes.
