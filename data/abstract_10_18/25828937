Infections due to drug-resistant Gram-negative rods are an emerging risk factor for increased mortality after solid organ transplant. Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Acinetobacter baumannii (Acb) is a major threat in several critical care settings. The limited available data on the outcome of XDR Acb infections in organ transplant recipients mostly comes from cases of donor-derived infections. However, recipients of life-saving organs are often critically ill patients, staying long term in intensive care units, and therefore at high risk for nosocomial infections. In this report, we describe our experience with the exceedingly complex management of a recipient-born XDR Acb bloodstream infection clinically ensued shortly after heart transplant. We also review the current literature on this mounting issue relevant for intensive care, transplant medicine and infectious diseases.
