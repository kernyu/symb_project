Those mice whose skin-derived primary fibroblast cell lines resist lethal injury induced by hydrogen peroxide or UV light show lower age-related decline in hearing. Skin cell lines may provide an easily accessible surrogate index of intrinsic stress resistance that varies among individuals and influences the pace of neurosensory decline in aging mice.
