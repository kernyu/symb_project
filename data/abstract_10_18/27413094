Beta-lactam antibiotics serve as a cornerstone in the management of bacterial infections because of their wide spectrum of activity and low toxicity. Since resistance rates among bacteria are continuously on the rise and the pipeline for new antibiotics does not meet this trend, an optimization of current beta-lactam treatment is needed. This review provides an overview of optimization through use of prolonged- and continuous-infusion dosing strategies compared with more traditional intermittent infusions. Included is an overview of the scientific basis for using these nontraditional prolonged- and continuous-infusion-based regimens, with a focus on major areas in which the clinical laboratory can support the clinical use of these regimens.
