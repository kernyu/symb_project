beta-Lactam antibiotics are one of the most important antibiotic classes but are plagued by problems of resistance, and the development of new beta-lactam antibiotics through side-chain modification of existing beta-lactam classes is not keeping pace with resistance development. In this JOCSynopsis, we summarize small molecule strategies to overcome resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. These approaches include the development of beta-lactamase inhibitors and compounds that interfere with the ability of the bacteria to sense an antibiotic threat and activate their resistance mechanisms.
