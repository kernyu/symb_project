MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed the results of the local microbiological monitoring carried out in 2010-2013. The monitoring included the study of biological material of patients with clinical signs of infectious and inflammatory complications after reconstructive surgery. We studied the dynamics of the isolation of major pathogens (Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., representatives of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Candida spp.) and their sensitivity to major antibiotics. RESULTS: We demonstrated the role of local monitoring and knowledge of the "drug history" in achieving of effective starting empirical antibiotic therapy.
