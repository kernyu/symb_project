Performance of the CHROMagar mSuperCARBA media was assessed in both well-characterized carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (n=52) and routine surveillance rectal swab specimens (n=211). Limit of detection ranged between 10(1) and 10(2)CFU/mL except for OXA-48 producers with low-carbapenem MICs (10(6)CFU/mL). High sensitivity (100%) and specificity (100%) were obtained with rectal swabs.
