AIMS: To characterize a clinical Shigella sonnei strain harboring a conjugatable blaCTX-M-55-borne plasmid. MATERIALS & METHODS: S. sonnei strain #1081 was isolated from a dysentery patient in China. A CTX-M-55-encoding plasmid harbored in this strain was transformed to Escherichia coli, and then its complete nucleotide sequence was determined by next generation sequencing. The MIC values of bacterial strains were tested by using Vitec((R)) 2 (Biomerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). RESULTS: Strain #1081 conferred the resistance to multiple beta-lactam antibiotics. blaCTX-M-55 was the only known antibiotic resistance gene and located in a 3090-bp ISEcp1-blaCTX-M-55-orf477 transposition unit carried by a conjugatable plasmid p1081-CTXM in #1081. The ISEcp1-mediated transposition provided a sole promoter, which was located adjacently upstream of the inverted repeat right element of ISEcp1, to drive the expression of CTX-M-55. CONCLUSION: Plasmid p1081-CTXM was a close variant of the IncI2-type plasmid pHN1122-1 that was harbored in a faecal E. coli strain recovered from a dog in China, indicating the potential transfer of CTX-M-55-encoding plasmids from faecal flora E. coli to human pathogen S. sonnei.
