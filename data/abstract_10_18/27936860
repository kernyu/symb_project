BACKGROUND: The distribution of drug resistance among clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae has limited the therapeutic options. The aim of this study was to report the prevalence of quinolone resistance genes among E. coli and K. pneumoniae clinical strains isolated from three educational hospitals of Tehran, Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 100 strains of E. coli from Labbafinejad and Taleghani Hospitals and 100 strains of K. pneumoniae from Mofid Children and Taleghani Hospitals were collected between January 2013 and May 2014. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were done by disk diffusion method based on Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Detection of qepA, aac(6')-Ib-cr, acrA, and acrB genes was done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: In this study, fosfomycin and imipenem against E. coli and fosfomycin and tigecycline against K. pneumoniae had the best effect in antimicrobial susceptibility tests. PCR assay using specific primers demonstrated that the prevalence of qepA, aac(6')-Ib-cr, acrA, and acrB genes among the 100 E. coli isolates was 0 (0%), 87 (87%), 92 (92%), and 84 (84%), respectively. The prevalence of qepA, aac(6')-Ib-cr, acrA, and acrB genes among the 100 K. pneumoniae isolates was 4 (4%), 85 (85%), 94 (94%), and 87 (87%), respectively. CONCLUSION: The distribution of qepA, aac(6')-Ib-cr, acrA, and acrB resistance determinants in E. coli and K. pneumoniae is a great concern. Therefore, infection control and prevention of spread of drug-resistant bacteria need careful management of medication and identification of resistant isolates.
