Bacillus cereus can cause diarrheal and emetic types of food poisoning but little study has been done on emetic type of food poisoning in Korea. The objective of this study was to report on the emetic type of food poisoning associated with B. cereus in Korea. The toxin gene profile, toxin production, and antibiotic resistance of B. cereus isolates were investigated in this study. B. cereus was detected in three out of four samples, while the other food poisoning bacteria were not detected. All isolates (KUGH 10, 11, and 12) presented nhe A, B, and C diarrheal toxin genes (755, 743, and 683 bp), detected using NHA, NHB, and NHC primers, and ces emetic toxin gene (1271 bp), detected using CES primer, and produced nonhemolytic enterotoxin and emetic toxin (cereulide), detected using immunochemical assay and high performance liquid chromotography/mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS) analysis. All emetic-associated isolates were resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. Most important finding in this study was that the risk of emetic-type B. cereus food poisoning has existed in Korea. This suggested that the food poisoning caused by B. cereus producing emetic and diarrheal toxins should be constantly evaluated to prevent misdiagnosis between emetic and diarrheal types of food poisoning.
