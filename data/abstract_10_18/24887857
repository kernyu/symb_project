Spinal cord tissue has a remarkable resistance to infection. An intramedullary abscess is an exceptional complication of infective endocarditis in the post-antibiotic era. We describe the case of a 42-year-old man who presented with fever and cephalea. Two days later, left-side numbness, lack of sphincter control, and a new aortic murmur were noticed. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated an 8 x15-mm intramedullary cervical abscess. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed an aortic valve perforation as a result of infective endocarditis. Conservative management was decided for the intramedullary abscess.
