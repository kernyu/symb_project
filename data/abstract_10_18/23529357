A fusant strain F14 with high biodegradation capability of phenanthrene was obtained by protoplast fusion between Sphingomonas sp. GY2B (GenBank DQ139343) and Pseudomonas sp. GP3A (GenBank EU233280). F14 was screened and identified from 39 random fusants by antibiotic tests, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). The result of SEM analysis demonstrated that the cell shape of fusant F14 different from parental strains. RAPD analysis of 5 primers generated a total of 70 bands. The genetic similarity indices between F14 and parental strains GY2B and GP3A were 27.9 and 34.6 %, respectively. F14 could rapidly degrade phenanthrene within 24 h, and the degradation efficiency was much better than GY2B and GP3A. GC-MS analysis of metabolites of phenanthrene degradation indicated F14 had a different degradation pathway from GY2B. Furthermore, the fusant strain F14 had a wider adaptation of temperatures (25-36 degrees C) and pH values (6.5-9.0) than GY2B. The present study indicated that fusant strain F14 could be an effective and environment-friendly bacterial strain for PAHs bioremediation.
