This cross sectional prospective study was carried out in the Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) and Department of Microbiology, University of Dhaka from July 2012 to June 2013. The objectives of this study were to identify the common microorganisms involved and the antibiograms of chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) patients in this tertiary care hospital in Bangladesh. A total of 117 patients clinically diagnosed of CSOM were enrolled in the study. They had chronic ear discharge & had not received any topical or systemic antibiotics for the previous five days. Swabs was taken and cultured for bacteria. The standard of isolation and identification was followed. Antimicrobial susceptibility of all aerobic bacterial isolates was performed by using modified Kirby Bauer Disk diffusion method. There were 186 positive cultures for organism from 117 patients. The most common causal organisms isolated were S. aureus (47.30%) and Pseudomonas spp. (27.40%) followed by S. epidermidis (16.10%), Klebsiella spp. (8.10%) and Escherichia coli. (1.10%). Gentamicin showed the highest sensitivity (89.8%) to S. aureus whereas erythromycin showed the lowest sensitivity (14.8%) with highest resistance (67%) to S. aureus. Pseudomonas spp. showed highest sensitivity against ciprofloxacin (78.4%) and highest resistance against cloxacillin (96.1%). Novobiocin showed the highest sensitivity (100%) followed by chloram phenicol (94.1%) to S. epidermidis. Klebsiella spp. and E. coli showed highest sensitivity against chloram phenicol. This study suggests that Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas are the commonest bacteria involved in CSOM in Bangladesh and Ciprofloxacin is an important tool in the management of active CSOM.
