Streptococcus suis is an emerging zoonotic agent. This study aimed to investigate whether S. suis is likely to translocate across the intestines of human hosts who have liver disease and/or consume alcohol. Both the alcoholism and cirrhosis models exhibited high mRNA expression of TGF and collagen1, but only the cirrhosis model had fibrosis in the liver. After both models were infected with S. suis, significantly different concentrations of S. suis were detected in the blood and brains of the alcoholism model (Blood: 36.4%; Brain: 31.8%) and the cirrhosis model (Blood: 62.5%; Brain: 62.5%) compared to the concentrations in the healthy mice (Blood: 15.4%; Brain: 0%). Trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TER) was used to examine the Caco-2 cells in the in vitro that had an S. suis infection combined with 1% ethanol. Although the ethanol did not influence the Caco-2 cells' barriers, it did rapidly decrease the barriers' TER value and then their E-cadherin compared to the infected Caco-2 cells without the ethanol treatment. Immunofluorescence also indicated that the barriers of the Caco-2 cells treated with ethanol were disrupted and that S. suis translocated from the apical to the basolateral side. This study demonstrated that alcohol consumption helped S. suis to translocate.
