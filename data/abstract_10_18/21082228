The mechanism of tissue protection from ischemic damage by activation of the mitochondrial ATP-dependent K(+) channel (mitoK(ATP)) remains unexplored. In this work, we have measured, using various approaches, the ATP-dependent mitochondrial K(+) transport in rats that differed in their resistance to hypoxia. The transport was found to be faster in the hypoxia-resistant rats as compared to that in the hypoxia-sensitive animals. Adaptation of animals to the intermittent normobaric hypoxia increased the rate of transport. At the same time, the intramitochondrial concentration of K(+) in the hypoxia-sensitive rats was higher than that in the resistant and adapted animals. This indicates that adaptation to hypoxia stimulates not only the influx of potassium into mitochondria, but also K(+)/H(+) exchange. When mitoK(ATP) was blocked, the rate of the mitochondrial H(2)O(2) production was found to be significantly higher in the hypoxia-resistant rats than that in the hypoxia-sensitive animals. The natural flavonoid-containing adaptogen Extralife, which has an evident antihypoxic effect, increased the rate of the mitochondrial ATP-dependent K(+) transport in vitro and increased the in vivo tolerance of hypoxia-sensitive rats to acute hypoxia 5-fold. The involvement of the mitochondrial K(+) transport in the mechanism of cell adaptation to hypoxia is discussed.
