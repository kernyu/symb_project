For many years, the clinical benefit of macrolide use has been recognized in specific groups of patients with pulmonary disease. Dramatic improvement in survival of patients with diffuse panbronchiolitis is the most striking example of successful macrolide use as well as treatment of community acquired pneumonia caused by the atypical bacteria Mycoplasma, Chlamydophila, and Legionella. There also has been documentation of reduction in the exacerbation rate and of improvement in quality of life in patients with cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and reduction in post-lung transplantation bronchiolitis frequency. There has long been an interest in treating patients with severe asthma by using macrolides, but research results have not shown consistent clinical benefit in their use in the "general" population of patients with severe asthma. Rather, the successful use of macrolides seems to be in those patients with either documented Mycoplasma or Chlamydophila infection, or noneosinophilic asthma. Patients with neutrophil predominant phenotype severe asthma tend to show a decline in exacerbation rate, improved peak expiratory flows, and improved quality of life when treated with macrolides. This article will review the use of macrolides in the treatment of asthma.
