Mutations in the UL97 gene are the most common mechanism of human cytomegalovirus resistance to ganciclovir in transplant recipients. In this study, UL97 fragments were amplified and sequenced in 70 Chinese kidney transplant recipients who were diagnosed as having an active cytomegalovirus infection. A new mutation, C518Y, was identified in two kidney recipients, and this strain showed high-grade ganciclovir resistance by plaque reduction assay. The known mutations L595 W and C607F were detected in one recipient, but the D605E mutation was found in 42.9 % (30/70) of kidney recipients. The prevalence of this mutation was higher than that in Europe and may be associated with different regions or races.
