The oseltamivir-resistant pandemic influenza virus A (2009 H1N1) with H275Y mutation in neuraminidase (NA) has been sporadically reported, and its wide spread remains a potential threat. Here we detected the uneven distribution of H275Y mutant virus in a patient who received a 21-day long-term administration of oseltamivir. Intrahost variation of the virus showed that the H275Y mutant virus was the predominant population in both nasopharynx and right lung, whereas the oseltamivir-sensitive virus comprised half the population in the left lung. By constructing minimum spanning trees, it is proposed that the H275Y mutant might be generated primarily in the nasopharynx, then spread to the right and left lungs.
