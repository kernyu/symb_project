BACKGROUND: The human and animal intestinal tract harbors a complex community of microbes which enables bacteria to inherit antibiotic resistance genes. The aims of this study were to investigate clonality, antimicrobial resistance, prevalence and gene cassette arrays of class I and II integrons among commensal Escherichia coli from human and animals. METHODS: A total of 200 E. coli isolates from human, chicken, cattle, and sheep were isolated followed by phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility testing and detection of class I and II integrons gene cassettes arrays. The clonal relationship of the isolates were analyzed by (GTG)5-PCR. RESULTS: Of 200 isolates, 136 isolates were multi drug resistance (MDR) including 47, 40, 31 and 18 isolates from chicken, human, cattle and sheep, respectively. Class I integron was detected in 50, 38, 6 and 16 %, while class II was detected in 26, 8, 0 and 4 % of chicken, human, cattle and sheep isolates, respectively. Variable regions were amplified and sequenced. Cassette arrays in class I integrons were: dfrA1, dfrA5, dfrA7, dfrA12, aadA1, dfrA17 aadA1, aadA22, aadB-aadA2 and dfrA12-orfF-aadA2, and for class II, dfrA1-sat-aadA1, and sat-sat1-aadA1 were detected. Six class I and three class II positive strains did not produce any amplicons for variable region. Integron-positive isolates showed higher rate of resistance to streptomycin and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, especially in chicken isolates which were fed antibiotics. Low similarity and great genetic diversity of class I and II integrons carrying isolates indicated no clonal relation. CONCLUSIONS: Integrons encoding for antibiotic resistance are significantly present among non-pathogenic commensal E. coli, especially from the hosts medicated by antibiotics. Uncontrolled use of antibiotics will increase the numbers of multiple drug resistant isolates and integrons prevalence.
