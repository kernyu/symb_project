OBJECTIVE: To explore organisational factors and barriers contributing to limited uptake of antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) in Australian private hospitals and to determine solutions for AMS implementation. METHODS: A qualitative study using a series of focus group discussions was conducted in a large private hospital making use of a semistructured interview guide to facilitate discussion among clinical and non-clinical stakeholders. A thematic analysis using five sequential components that mapped and interpreted emergent themes surrounding AMS implementation was undertaken by a multidisciplinary team of researchers. RESULTS: Analysis revealed that autonomy of consultant specialists was perceived as being of greater significance in private hospitals compared with public hospitals. Use of an expert team providing antimicrobial prescribing advice and education without intruding on existing patient-specialist relationships was proposed by participants as an acceptable method of introducing AMS in private hospitals. There was more opportunity for nursing and pharmacist involvement, as well as empowering patients. Opportunities were identified for the hospital executive to market an AMS service as a feature that promoted excellence in patient care. CONCLUSIONS: Provision of advice from experts, championing by clinical leaders, marketing by hospital executives and involving nurses, pharmacists and patients should be considered during implementation of AMS in private hospitals.
