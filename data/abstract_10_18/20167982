BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Paediatric urinary tract infections (UTI) are associated with high morbidity and long term complications like renal scarring, hypertension, and chronic renal failure. A cause of occult febrile illness, they often remain undiagnosed. We studied the clinical and microbiologic profile and antibiotic resistance profile of such infections in paediatric UTI patients at our center. METHODS: Clean catch mid-stream urine samples for culture were received from 1974 children aged<12 yr over a period of 6 months.Quantitative wet mount microscopy and semiquantitative culture on cysteine lactose electrolyte deficient medium were done to diagnose UTI. Isolates were identified by standard biochemical tests and antimicrobial sensitivity was determined. Clinical details including risk factors and underlying illness were noted. RESULTS: Significant bacteriuria was found in 558 children (28.3%). Male gender (25.6%), age<1 yr (77.5%), vesicoureteric reflux disease (VUR) (19.9%) and posterior urethral valve (PUV) (27.6%) were common risk factors in children suffering from UTI.Pyuria was detected in 53.6 per cent of infections. Common uropathogens isolated were Escherichia coli (47.1%), Klebsiella spp. (15.6%), Enterococcus fecalis (8.7%), members of tribe Proteae (5.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.9%) and Candida spp. (5.5%). Against lactose fermenting Enterobacteriaceae, in-vitro resistance was least against amikacin (32.5%), nitrofurantoin (26.7%) and imipenem (3.7%). Among enterococci, vancomycin resistant enterococci constituted 12 per cent of the strains. 93.4 per cent of the UTI detected was nosocomial. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Paediatric UTI was common in children with male gender, age<1 yr, and in children suffering from VUR and PUV. Spectrum of pathogens causing paediatric UTI in our center had a preponderance of nosocomial multi-drug resistant pathogens.
