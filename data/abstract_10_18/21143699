Streptococcus pneumoniae resides on mucosal surfaces in the nasopharynx, where selection for horizontal transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes and virulence factors may provide a survival advantage. We investigated the distribution of genes for pneumococcal cell surface proteins and their correlations with multilocus sequence typing (MLST), Pneumococcal Molecular Epidemiology Network (PMEN) clones and antimicrobial resistance, to identify pneumococcal virulence factors predicting prevalent clones from 156 pneumococcal isolates recovered from adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia in Japan. Pneumococcal eno, pavA, piuA, cbpA and cbpG were present in all isolates, and hyl and piaA were distributed among the clinical isolates. In contrast, pneumococcal rlrA, pclA, psrP, nanC and pspA family 1-type genes were variably distributed and significantly associated with MLST (Wallace coefficients (W) were over 84%). Serotype was a weaker predictor of sequence type (W, 0.75) than vice versa (W, 0.97). A multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted to the presence of virulence genes, pspA family 1 genes and carriage serotypes revealed that pclA and rlrA correlated with PMEN clones and antimicrobial resistance, and are likely to contribute to the selection of prevalent clones.
