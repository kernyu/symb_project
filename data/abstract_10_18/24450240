The aim of this study was to retrospectively investigate nosocomial bloodstream infections (NBI) and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns at Afyon Kocatepe University (AKU) Hospital, Turkey, from January 2006 to December 2011 and to determine the risk factors for nosocomial BSI. Subjects were aged > or = 18 years. The data were obtained from patient files. Five hundred seventy-nine nosocomial infections in 461 patients were included in the study. Eighty-four point six percent was primary and 15.4% were secondary infections. Gram-positive cocci were the most common organisms. When compared year by year there was an increasing trend in antibacterial resistant gram-negative bacilli. The most common infection risk factors were H2 histamine receptor blocker use and blood transfusions. Regular surveillance of BSI is important to monitor changes in the types of microorganisms and their resistance patterns.
