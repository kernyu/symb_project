BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates with inducible clindamycin resistance (iCR) are resistant to erythromycin and sensitive to clindamycin on routine testing and inducible clindamycin resistance can only be identified by D-test. This study was aimed to detect methicillin resistance and iCR among S. aureus isolates, effectiveness of some commonly used antibiotics and correlation between methicillin resistance and iCR. METHODS: The present cross-sectional study included 46 S. aureus isolates subjected to Kirby-Bauer's disk diffusion method for antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) to estimate MRSA and resistance to some commonly used antibiotics. D-test was employed to detect iCR. RESULTS: Eleven of the 46 (23.9%) isolates tested were MRSA. Overall, 19 (41.3%) isolates showed of iCR. Vancomycin and linezolid were found to be 100 per cent effective. A positive Karl-Pearson's coefficient of correlation (0.89) between methicillin resistance and iCR was obtained. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Detection of iCR is important for the use of clindamycin in MRSA infections. Methicillin resistance and iCR appear to be clinically unrelated.
