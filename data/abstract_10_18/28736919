BACKGROUND: The macrocyclic lactones abamectin and milbemectin are frequently used to control phytophagous mites such as Tetranychus urticae. Consequently, resistance has developed and was genetically linked with substitutions in the glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl) subunits TuGluCl1 and TuGluCl3. Here, we functionally validated a G326E substitution in TuGluCl3 by functional expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes followed by two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology. RESULTS: Homomeric wild-type and mutated GluCl3 were successfully expressed. l-glutamic-acid-induced currents exhibited a rapid onset equal in both channels and EC50 for l-glutamic-acid was in the micromolar range (384.2 mum and 292.7 mum, respectively). Abamectin and milbemycin A4 elicited sustained currents in wild-type GluCl3, but the G326E substitution completely abolished the agonistic activity of macrocyclic lactones. CONCLUSION: A target-site mutation in Tu GluCl3 contributes to avermectin resistance in T. urticae. However, given the multitude of channel genes and the potential additive or synergistic effects of mutations, to what extent mutations determine the often extremely strong resistance phenotype in the field deserves further study.
