Real-time PCR assays were developed for the enumeration of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) determinants, such as the qnrA, qnrB, and qnrS genes, in different water samples and chicken feces. The results indicate that the developed assays are specific and sensitive for the quantification of qnr genes in complex samples.
