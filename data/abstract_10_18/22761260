PURPOSE: Chronic, subclinical inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of several ocular diseases, including age-related macular degeneration. Proinflammatory cytokines affect tight junctions in epithelia that lack claudin-19, but in the retinal pigment epithelium claudin-19 predominates. We examined the effects of cytokines on the tight junctions of human fetal RPE (hfRPE). METHODS: hfRPE was incubated with interleukin 1-beta (IL-1beta), interferon-gamma (IFNgamma), or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), alone or in combination. Permeability and selectivity of the tight junctions were assessed using nonionic tracers and electrophysiology. Claudins, occludin, and ZO-1 were examined using PCR, immunoblotting, and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: Only TNFalpha consistently reduced transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) >80%. A serum-free medium revealed two effects of TNFalpha: (1) decreased TER was observed only when TNFalpha was added to the apical side of the monolayer, and (2) expression of TNFalpha receptors and inhibitors of apoptosis were induced from either side of the monolayer. In untreated cultures, tight junctions were slightly cation selective, and this was affected minimally by TNFalpha. The results were unexplained by effects on claudin-2, claudin-3, claudin-19, occludin, and ZO-1, but changes in the morphology of the junctions and actin cytoskeleton may have a role. CONCLUSIONS: Claudin-19-rich tight junctions have low permeability for ionic and nonionic solutes, and are slightly cation-selective. Claudin-19 is not a direct target of TNFalpha. TNFalpha may protect RPE from apoptosis, but makes the monolayer leaky when it is presented to the apical side of the monolayer. Unlike other epithelia, IFNgamma failed to augment the effect of TNFalpha on tight junctions.
