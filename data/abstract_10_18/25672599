Because of its resistance profiles, Pseudomonas aeruginosa remains probably one of the challenging bacteria responsible for ventilator-associated pneumonia in the ICU. Nevertheless, a much better understanding of its mechanism of virulence, such as the type 3 secretion system that can also impact on resistance, gives some opportunities for management improvement. The most promising approach is probably the production of monoclonal antibodies that enable not only more targeted treatments but also development of some early preemptive approaches at the time of colonization through real-time diagnosis.
