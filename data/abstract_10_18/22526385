Candida tropicalis is one of the most important Candida species causative of candidemia that is isolated from the blood of patients with hematological malignancies. Candidemia caused by C. tropicalis is known to be highly virulent in neutropenic patients. C. tropicalis has been shown to be favorably sensitive to azole agents in general. Here we discuss 5 cases of candidemia caused by C. tropicalis in patients with hematological malignancies in our unit, and we note that 4 isolates were resistant to azole agents, including fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole. In addition, 2 patients developed breakthrough candidemia caused by C. tropicalis while receiving prophylaxis with azole agents. Interestingly, 2 of the 4 patients with azole-resistant C. tropicalis isolates had never received any antifungal drugs. We also examined the susceptibilities of C. tropicalis to antifungal agents, using 39 non-blood isolates detected from 2003 to 2009. Around 40 % of the isolates were resistant to azole agents, and all of them were highly sensitive to amphotericin B and micafungin. The resistance to azoles was not associated with previous exposure to those agents. In our unit, 2 of the 4 cases of candidemia caused by azole-resistant C. tropicalis resulted in a poor prognosis. These findings suggested that empirical therapeutic strategies for candidemia should be modified based on the local antifungal resistance pattern.
