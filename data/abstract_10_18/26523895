INTRODUCTION: Multiorgan failure (MOF) is a primary cause of morbidity and mortality in sepsis patients in intensive care units (ICU). Finding risk factors and solving preventable problems of MOF in patients who have sepsis can be a favourable step for decreasing mortality. We aimed to examine multiorgan failure and mortality related risk factors in intensive care unit patients who have sepsis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective data collection and prognostic cohort study was performed. Between January 2009-March 2010, patients accepted to the 22-bed pulmonary intensive care unit with the diagnosis of sepsis were enrolled. Patients' demographic data, ICU severity scores, application of mechanical ventilation, causative agent of sepsis, number of ICU days and presence of mortality were recorded. Logistic regression analysis was carried out for risk factors. RESULT: 347 patients with sepsis were involved in the study. 43 of the patients (12.4%) developed MOF and overall mortality rate was 14.9% (n= 52). Presence of resistant pathogen, presence of shock, application of TPN and high APACHE II score were found to be risk factors for MOF [p= 0.015 Odds ratio (OR) 3.47 confidence interval (CI): 1.27 - 9.47, p= 0.001, OR: 30.8 CI: 11.41 - 83-49, p= 0.028, OR: 3.08, CI: 1.13 - 8.39, p= 0.003, OR: 1.10, CI: 1.04-1.18, respectively]. Risk factors for overall mortality were presence of nosocomial infection, high 3rd day SOFA score, presence of shock, application of TPN and sedation (p= 0.005, OR: 3.39, CI: 1.45 - 7.93; p= 0.001, OR: 1.51, CI: 1.27 - 1.81; p= 0.014, OR: 3.24, CI: 1.27 - 8.25; p= 0.003, OR: 3.64. CI: 1.54 - 8.58; p= 0.001, OR: 3.38, CI: 1.51 - 7.57, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In sepsis patients who need ICU follow up, presence of resistant pathogen, presence of shock, application of TPN and high APACHE II scores are risk factors for developing MOF. Thus, rational use of antibiotics, reducing the use of TPN, application of infection control programmes and prevention of shock will further reduce multiorgan failure and mortality.
