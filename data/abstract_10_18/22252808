Understanding factors associated with de novo daptomycin-nonsusceptible Enterococcus (DNSE) infections will aid in better understanding the mechanisms of daptomycin nonsusceptibility. We conducted a case-control study to compare patients with DNSE infections who were daptomycin treatment naive (n = 9) and those with DNSE infections who had exposure to daptomycin (n = 13). Less frequent exposure to antimicrobials, increased susceptibility to nitrofurantoin and gentamicin, and shorter duration of hospitalization were associated with de novo DNSE infection, suggesting a potential community reservoir.
