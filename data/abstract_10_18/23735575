Hematology Oncology has a rich history including few crucial therapeutic innovations. These were possible because of the evolution of the cell and molecular biology allowing a better understanding of basic mechanisms of cancerogenesis. We propose here to summarize the most important therapeutic innovations since the beginning of Hematology/Oncology history. We also describe evolution of therapeutic strategies themselves. New insights and therapeutic perspectives for next future are also discussed.
