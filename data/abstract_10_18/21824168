HIV/AIDS has become one of the most important infectious diseases with a cumulative number of almost 60 million infections worldwide. The prevalence and epidemiological patterns are unevenly distributed across the globe and also within countries. HIV is one of the fastest evolving organisms known. Several genetically distinct subtypes are present and new circulating recombinant forms are continuously emerging. This review discusses HIV-1 evolution in relation to molecular epidemiology and antiretroviral resistance. Factors and concepts that influence global spread and within-patient evolution of HIV-1 are discussed as well as future perspectives on the use of phylodynamics in HIV epidemiology.
