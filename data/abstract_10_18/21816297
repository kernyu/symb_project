Hand infections are commonly seen by orthopedic surgeons as well as emergency room and primary care physicians. Identifying the cause of the infection and initiating prompt and appropriate medical or surgical treatment can prevent substantial morbidity. The most common bacteria implicated in hand infections remain Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus species. Methicillin-resistant S aureus infections have become prevalent and represent a difficult problem best treated with empiric antibiotic therapy until the organism can be confirmed. Other organisms can be involved in specific situations that will be reviewed. Types of infections include cellulitis, superficial abscesses, deep abscesses, septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis. In recent years, treatment of these infections has become challenging owing to increased virulence of some organisms and drug resistance. Treatment involves a combination of proper antimicrobial therapy, immobilization, edema control, and adequate surgical therapy. Best practice management requires use of appropriate diagnostic tools, understanding by the surgeon of the unique and complex anatomy of the hand, and proper antibiotic selection in consultation with infectious disease specialists.
