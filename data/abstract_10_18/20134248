In this study, the metabolic activities of five strains of amount of Pediococcus spp. in terms of the quantities they produced of lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, exopolysaccharides and proteolytic activity were determined. Lactic acid levels produced by these strains were found to be in the range of 2.5-5.6 mg/ml. All strains produced hydrogen peroxide. The P. pentosaceus Z13P strain produced the maximum amount (0.25 mg/ml) of proteolytic activity. Exopolysaccharide (EPS) production by the Pediococcus strains during growth in MRS medium was in the range 25-64 mg/l. The susceptibility of 10 different antibiotics against these strains was also tested. All strains were found to be resistant to amoxicillin, gentamicin, and vancomicin. Antimicrobial effects of the Pediococcus on pathogens were also determined by an agar diffusion method. All of the strains were able to inhibit L. monocytogenes. The tolerance of the strains to low pH, their resistance to bile salts of strains, and their abilities to autoaggregate and coaggregate with L. monocytogenes were also evaluated.
