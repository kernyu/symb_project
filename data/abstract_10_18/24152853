Antimicrobial susceptibility and ESBLs genes of 42 imipenem resistant A. baumannii carried out by DDST and PCR. The most antimicrobial agents against A. baumannii strains, harboring blaOXA-23-like carbapenemases, were meropenem (33.4 percent), piperacillin-tazobactam (23.9 percent), ceftazidime (14.3 percent) and gatifoxacin (19.1 percent), respectively. All the 42 isolates harbored the blaTEM gene, but the bla SHV and VEB genes were not present among all the isolates. With the exception of seven isolates, all the A. baumannii strains harbor blaTEM showed ESBL positivity in DDST. The result of this study show that resistance against antimicrobial agents, especially carbapenems, has increased and that blaTEM harboring A. baumannii strains can be help the blaOXA-like carbapenemase genes to code for resistance against carbapenem antibiotics.
