OBJECTIVE: To investigate the bacterial distribution and resistance to antibiotics in culture-positive urine, and to provide reference for rational use of antibiotics in clinical practice. METHODS: Distribution and antibiotic resistance to pathogens in 658 culture-positive patients from Jan. 1, 2007 to Dec. 31, 2008 were analyzed. RESULTS: (1)Pathogenic strains from the 658 patients were collected from the urine specimen in the survey, which included Gram-negative bacilli (70.82%), Gram-positive cocci (26.14%) and fungi (3.04%). The distribution rate of Escherichia coli declined from 68.91% in 2008 to 63.43% in 2007 (P>0.05), and Enterococcus rose from 3.37% to 7.67% (P>0.05), but the difference was not significant. The proportion of Gram-negative bacilli (especially the E.coli) from patients in the Emergency Department and Out-patient Department was higher than that from in-patients, and the proportion of K. pneumonia and Gram-positive bacteria was lower than in-patients, both with significant differences (P<0.05). (2) The resistance rate of E. coli and K. pneumonia to quinolones was 28.57%-56.25%, and the resistance rate to 3rd generation cephalosporin was 38.78%-65.78%, respectively. The resistance rate of Gram-positive cocci to quinolones and 3rd generation cephalosporin was both higher than 50%, and was 11.05% to Vancomycin. CONCLUSION: Gram-negative bacilli such as E. coli and K. pneumonia are predominant organism in the urinary tract infections, but proportion of Gram-positive bacteria has increased in recent years. Attention needs to be paid to the overall and severe bacterial resistance in the urinary tract infections and rational use of antibiotics.
