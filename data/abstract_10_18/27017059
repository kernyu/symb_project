INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to determine the differences in percentage resistance in H. pylori clinical isolates using EUCAST breakpoints compared with previously used breakpoints. MIC value distribution in H. pylori clinical isolates was also studied. METHODS: Susceptibility to amoxicillin, tetracycline, metronidazole, clarithromycin, rifampicin and levofloxacin was performed by E-test in 824 H. pylori clinical isolates. EUCAST and previous breakpoints defined resistance as follows: MIC >0.12mg/L and >/=2mg/L for amoxicillin, >8mg/L and >/=8mg/L for metronidazole, >0.5mg/L and >/=1mg/L for clarithromycin, >1mg/L and >/=32mg/L for rifampicin, and >1mg/L and >/=4mg/L for tetracycline and >1mg/L levofloxacin. RESULTS: Overall resistance rate by EUCAST and by previous breakpoints was 8.5% and 3.2% for amoxicillin, 0.6% and 0.1% for tetracycline, 39.2% and 39.7% for metronidazole, 51.2% and 51.2% for clarithromycin, 32% and 3.1% for rifampicin, and 6.7% and 6.7% for levofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: When using the different breakpoints for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, similar results were found with most antibiotics tested (tetracycline, metronidazole, clarithromycin, and levofloxacin), except for amoxicillin and rifampicin.
