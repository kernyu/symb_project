This study describes 3 different blaNDM-1 genetic platforms in 3 different species obtained from the same patient who was directly transferred to an institution in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, following a prolonged hospital stay in India. The blaNDM-1 in the Escherichia coli isolate was located on a 176-kb IncA/C plasmid contained within an ISCR1 region. The blaNDM-1 in the Providencia rettgeri isolate was located on a 117-kb IncT plasmid contained within Tn3000, while the blaNDM-1 in the Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolate was located on the chromosome within an ISCR3 region. This report highlights the plasticity of the genetic regions and environments associated with blaNDM-1. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of P. aeruginosa with blaNDM-1 identified in North America and the first report of blaOXA-181 in P. rettgeri. The P. aeruginosa isolate belonged to the international high-risk sequence type 654 clone and was nonsusceptible to colistin. This case emphasizes the need for the use of appropriate infection prevention and control measures and vigilant screening for carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria in patients with a history of travel to areas of endemicity, such as the Indian subcontinent.
