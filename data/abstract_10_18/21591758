New phenazines were synthesized by oxygenation of 1- and 2-naphthol with transition metal peroxo complexes and in situ reaction with 1,2-diamines. The title compounds were evaluated for in vitro antimalarial activity against Plasmodium falciparum and chloroquine-resistant strains. Phenazines 12, 27, and 28 were most prominent in growth inhibition. In vivo protection against cerebral malaria was observed with the phenazines 11, 12, 20, and 27, whereas partial protection was provided by 19.
