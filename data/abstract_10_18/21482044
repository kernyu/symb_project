Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of nitrofurantoin were determined by agar dilution in 269 canine and feline isolates of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, two of the most common bacterial species associated with urinary tract infection (UTI) in small animals. The MIC90 for E. coli and S. pseudintermedius were 32 and 16 mug/ml, respectively. All isolates, including multidrug-resistant strains of known genetic background, displayed MICs below the drug concentrations reported in canine urine following oral administration of nitrofurantoin. Preliminary data on mutant prevention concentration (MPC) and many years of nitrofurantoin usage in human medicine suggest that emergence of resistant mutants during treatment is not a critical issue for this drug. The study provides species-specific data on nitrofurantoin MIC distribution that can be used for setting dog- and cat-specific breakpoints. Although nitrofurantoin is not an appropriate first-line agent for empirical treatment of canine UTI due to toxicity and poor pharmacokinetic properties, it may be indicated for treatment of UTI caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria, which are otherwise difficult to treat using conventional veterinary antimicrobial agents.
