OBJECTIVE: We studied the resistance of Fusarium fujikuroi against carbendazim, to confirm whether the resistance was related to the beta-tubulin gene. METHODS: The isolated strains were identified based on TEF-1alpha gene sequence and morphological characteristics. The whole nucleotide sequence of beta-tubulin gene was analyzed from different sensitive strains by the primers designed according to the nucleotide sequence of beta-tubulin gene from the sequenced strain 7600 of F. verticillioides. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was applied to analyze the expression pattern of beta-tubulin gene from different sensitive strains treated with or without carbendazim. RESULTS: The full-length nucleotide sequence of beta-tubulin gene (Accession Number: JQ026022) was cloned from different sensitive strains of F. fujikoroi, which spanned 1671 bp with 4 introns, encoding 447 amino acids. This gene showed 100% nucleotide sequence homology between sensitive and resistant strains. The expression of the beta-tubulin gene in 2 sensitive strains was significantly higher than 3 resistant strains when these strains were cultured on carbendazim-free media (p = 0.05). Carbendazim at the concentration of their EC50 caused the expression of the gene from the five strains increasing significantly (p = 0.05) in comparison with that of strains treated without carbendazim. However, there was no significant difference between strains when treated with carbendazim. CONCLUSION: The resistance of F. fujikuroi against carbendazim was irrelative to beta-tubulin gene.
