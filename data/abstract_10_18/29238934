Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) infections are associated with high mortality, and experiences with its treatment are usually based on carbapenemase-producing strains. Non-carbapenemase-producing CRKP is of clinical significance, but relevant studies are lacking. This nationwide study aimed to evaluate the outcome of antimicrobial therapy in patients with non-carbapenemase-producing CRKP infections. Patients with non-carbapenemase-producing CRKP infections were enrolled from 16 hospitals during January 2013 to December 2014 in Taiwan. Carbapenem resistance was defined as reduced susceptibility with a minimum inhibitory concentration of >/=2 mg/L for imipenem or meropenem. The resistance mechanisms of CRKP isolates were analyzed, and the clinical data of these patients were collected retrospectively. Independent risk factors of 14-day morality were determined by Cox regression analysis. A total of 99 patients with non-carbapenemase-producing CRKP infections were enrolled, and 14-day mortality was 27.3%. Among 67 patients treated with appropriate antimicrobial therapy, most (n = 61) patients received monotherapy. The 14-day mortality was lower in patients treated with appropriate monotherapy (21.3%) than in those with inappropriate therapy (37.5%). The multivariate regression model identified monotherapy (hazard ratio [HR], 0.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.13-0.71; P = 0.005) as protective factor, and APACHE II scores (HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.01-1.18; P = 0.022) as risk factor associated with 14-day mortality. Tigecycline, colistin, and carbapenem were the most commonly used drugs in monotherapy. This study provides evidence supporting the efficacy of monotherapy in the treatment of non-carbapenemase-producing CRKP infections, and provides a future target for antibiotics stewardship for CRKP infection.
