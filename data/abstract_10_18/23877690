The effect of antichagasic benznidazole (BZL; 100 mg/kg body weight/day, 3 consecutive days, intraperitoneally) on biotransformation systems and ABC transporters was evaluated in rats. Expression of cytochrome P-450 (CYP3A), UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A), glutathione S-transferases (alpha glutathione S-transferase [GST-alpha], GST-mu, and GST-pi), multidrug-resistance-associated protein 2 (Mrp2), and P glycoprotein (P-gp) in liver, small intestine, and kidney was estimated by Western blotting. Increases in hepatic CYP3A (30%) and GST-mu (40%) and in intestinal GST-alpha (72% in jejunum and 136% in ileum) were detected. Significant increases in Mrp2 (300%) and P-gp (500%) proteins in liver from BZL-treated rats were observed without changes in kidney. P-gp and Mrp2 were also increased by BZL in jejunum (170% and 120%, respectively). In ileum, only P-gp was increased by BZL (50%). The activities of GST, P-gp, and Mrp2 correlated well with the upregulation of proteins in liver and jejunum. Plasma decay of a test dose of BZL (5 mg/kg body weight) administered intraduodenally was faster (295%) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) was lower (41%) for BZL-pretreated rats than for controls. The biliary excretion of BZL was higher (60%) in the BZL group, and urinary excretion of BZL did not show differences between groups. The amount of absorbed BZL in intestinal sacs was lower (25%) in pretreated rats than in controls. In conclusion, induction of biotransformation enzymes and/or transporters by BZL could increase the clearance and/or decrease the intestinal absorption of coadministered drugs that are substrates of these systems, including BZL itself.
