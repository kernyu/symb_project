Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is the most frequent infection in patients with cirrhosis during hospitalization and is associated with high acute and long-term mortality. Diagnosis is made by paracentesis with determination of neutrophil count in ascitic fluid. Empirical antibiotic therapy must be initiated immediately. The choice of drug is dependent on prior therapies. Liver transplantation has to be considered in the absence of contra-indications. Prophylaxis of SBP is indicated in patients with ascites and gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and in patients after SBP. Primary prophylaxis should be considered in high-risk patients with cirrhosis and ascites. The development of resistance to antibiotic drugs is a relevant side-effect.
