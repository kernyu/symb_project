BACKGROUND: This prospective study aimed at assessing the effect of initial antibiotic therapy on the mortality of patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) by analyzing bacterial pathogens and their resistance to antimicrobial agents. METHODS: Included were patients hospitalized in the Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc and University Hospital Olomouc in 2009 who developed HAP. Bacterial pathogens and their resistance to antibiotics were identified using standard microbiological methods. The patient's mortality with respect to their initial antibiotic therapy was statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The group comprised 51 patients with HAP. Early-onset HAP was identified in 7 (14%) patients and late-onset HAP in 44 (86%) patients. The most frequent bacterial pathogens were strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia complex and Escherichia coli, together accounting for 72%. Eighteen patients died directly due to HAP, an overall mortality rate of 35%. If initial therapy effective against the bacterial pathogen was selected, 21 patients survived and 9 died. If the bacterial pathogens were resistant to the selected initial antibiotic therapy, 9 patients died and 12 survived. CONCLUSIONS: The mortality rates were 30% and 43% for adequate and inadequate antibiotic therapy, respectively. Given the small group of patients, the difference has low statistical significance. However, it does document the clinical impact of bacterial resistance on the survival or death of patients with HAP.
