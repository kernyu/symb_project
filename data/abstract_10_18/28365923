In this study, the prevalence of Campylobacter spp. in poultry fresh meat and readytocook products was evaluated. Seventythree samples were collected at retail level from supermarkets and discount stores, obtaining 61.6% positivity. Of 133 Campylobacter isolates, 86 strains (Campylobacter coli, 58.1% and Campylobacter jejuni, 41.9%) were selected for characterisation on the basis of their SmaI and kpnI pulsed field gelelectrophoresis (PFGE) profiles, to exclude clonal replicates. Campylobacters resulted highly resistant to tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, and nalidixic acid (79.1%, 72.1% and 65.1%, respectively); 50% of C. coli and 13.9% of C. jejuni were resistant to ciprofloxacin and erythromycin, the most important antimicrobials for human campylobacteriosis therapy. Five C. coli were resistant to 5/7 of the tested antimicrobials. HS4c was the prevailing C. jejuni serotype group (22.3%), whereas 8 other serotypes were identified in low percentages. SmaI and kpnI profiles showed a wide variability. The survey showed a high Campylobacter contamination of poultry meat and poultry products at retail level in Tuscany, Italy. A wide strains' heterogeneity and a remarkable level of strains' antimicrobial resistance have been reported, confirming the need for an improvement of specific preventive measures along the production chain.
