Underhill and colleagues (Shimada et al., 2010) provide evidence for an intriguing link between the activity of lysozyme in the phagosome and activation of the Nlrp3 inflammasome, a cytosolic regulator of inflammation and cytokine production. The authors show that resistance to lysozyme allows Staphylococcus aureus to evade Nlrp3 activation.
