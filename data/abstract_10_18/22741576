The aim was to assess the potency of the efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) phenylalanine-arginine ss-naphthylamide (PAssN) and 1-(1-naphthylmethyl)-piperazine (NMP) and the putative natural EPI phenolic (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) for the reversal of erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, and tetracycline resistance in Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli isolates. We investigated target mutations and resistant genes involved in erythromycin and tetracycline resistance and determined the roles of the bacterial drug efflux systems (cmeB, cmeF, and cmeR) in antimicrobial resistance. Our data show that most of the high-level erythromycin resistance and all of the tetracycline resistance can be explained through mutations in 23S rRNA and the presence of the tetO gene, respectively. The EPIs show the ability to partly reverse drug resistance in these Campylobacter isolates. Based on a fourfold or greater reduction in the erythromycin minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), PAssN and NMP had clear effects in almost of all of the isolates tested. PAssN had a highly selective action on the ciprofloxacin and tetracycline MICs. Inactivation of cmeB increased susceptibility to all of the antimicrobials tested, whereas inactivation of cmeF and cmeR had no effects. A notable decrease in resistance to erythromycin and ciprofloxacin in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of EGCG demonstrates the resistance-modifying activities of this natural EPI, and indicates its potential use in the control of Campylobacter spp. in the food chain.
