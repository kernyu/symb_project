OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of Acinetobacter species isolated from pus and pus swab specimens at a tertiary care setting. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Microbiology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi, from July 2008 to July 2012. METHODOLOGY: Data regarding positive culture and antimicrobial sensitivity pattern was retrieved from the pus and pus swab culture records of the Microbiology Department, AFIP, Rawalpindi. Only those pus and pus swab specimens which yielded the growth of Acinetobacterspecies were included in the study. RESULTS: Out of 2781, 1848 were of pure pus while 933 were pus swab specimens. Out of 2538 culture positive isolates, 276 (10.9%) were identified as Acinetobacterspecies. Among 276 Acinetobacterspp., 245 (88.8%) were Acinetobacter baumannii and 31 (11.2%) were Acinetobacterjohnsonii. Male/female ratio of the affected patients was 5.6:1. Doxycycline was the most sensitive antibiotic to which 45% of the tested isolates were sensitive. Sensitivity to all other antimicrobials was 15% or less. CONCLUSION: About 11% of soft tissue and wound infections are caused by Acinetobacterspecies in our set up particularly in male. Doxycycline was the most sensitive antibiotic. Sensitivity to all other antimicrobials was 15% or less. In vitro sensitivity to carbapenems is very low.
