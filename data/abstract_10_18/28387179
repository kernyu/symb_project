The management of tuberculosis (TB) can be a challenging process that has implications both for the affected patient and public health. Effective anti-TB chemotherapy both cures and renders the patient noncontagious. Biological factors specific to M. tuberculosis necessitate the use of multiple drugs for prolonged durations to adequately eradicate infection. Recommended regimens address the complexities of eliminating organisms from diverse reservoirs while preventing the emergence of drug resistance. First-line anti-TB therapy for drug susceptible disease effectively cures almost all patients within 6-9 months. The loss of first-line agents, due to resistance or intolerance, necessitates lengthy treatment courses, frequently 12-18 months or longer. Due to the long treatment times and the implications of missed doses, directly-observed therapy (DOT) is considered the standard of care. Drugs used for the treatment of TB have serious potential toxicities that require close monitoring and prompt response. A strong public health infrastructure and robust social supports are important elements to assure successful treatment. These numerous factors compel public health entities to take a lead role in the management of TB, either through the direct management of TB treatment or by assuring the activities of partner organizations.
