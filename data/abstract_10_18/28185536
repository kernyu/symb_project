BACKGROUND: Aging is a risk factor of age-related diseases. With the increasing number of patients, serious consequences, and heavy economic burden, demands for drugs used to treat agerelated diseases have increased. As such, anti-aging substances should be isolated to develop drugs for the prevention and treatment of age-related diseases. METHOD: In this study, a methanol extract of immature Arabidopsis thaliana seeds with coat was separated by using a K6001 yeast bioassay system. In order to investigate the action mechanism, four mutants, namely, Deltauth1, Deltaskn7, Deltasod1, and Deltasod2 with K6001 background were employed and the anti-oxidative stress assay was performed. RESULTS: One new anti-aging lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) was obtained, and its structural and stereochemical characteristics were elucidated through spectroscopy and chemical derivatization. LPA can extend the replicative lifespan of K6001 at 10 and 30 microM (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively). This finding was comparable to the effect of resveratrol, a well-known anti-aging substance. However, the anti-aging activity of the compound on the four mutants was diminished. In the antioxidative stress assay, LPA improved the oxidative resistance of yeast cells. CONCLUSION: The new LPA may exert its anti-aging effect by improving the anti-oxidative ability of yeast cells. The genes of UTH1, SKN7, and SOD may also be involved in the action.
