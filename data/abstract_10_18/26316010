BACKGROUND: Streptococcus agalactiae [group B Streptococcus (GBS)] has become more prevalent in nonpregnant women, the elderly, and people who are immunocompromised. We investigated the serotype and genomic changes of GBS human isolates from different hospitals from 2007 to 2012. METHODS: The serotype and genotype of 658 GBS human isolates were determined with multiplex polymerase chain reaction and pulsed field gel electrophoresis analysis. Multilocus sequence typing analysis determined the sequence type (ST) of the major clones of serotypes Ib, V, and VI. RESULTS: Most of the isolates were collected from urine samples (60.5%) with a reduction in the rate from 74.6% in 2007 to 34.5% in 2012 and from infected patients older than 30 years (72.6%). The female/male ratio differed depending on the source: 3.52 in the urine group, 0.48 in the wound group, and 0.43 in pus. Serotypes Ib (16.5%), III (16.9%), V (27.2%), and VI (17.6%) were the most predominant among the nine serotypes identified and were separated into two prevalence patterns: a decrease in serotypes Ib and V and an increase in serotypes III and VI from 2007 to 2012. The prevalence change was associated with the urine group. Additionally, serotype VI become more prevalent in blood samples in four hospitals. The pulsed field gel electrophoresis analysis demonstrated three genetic patterns: limited pulsotypes and a major clonal dissemination for serotypes Ib and V, diverse pulsotypes for serotypes III, and diverse pulsotypes with a major clonal dissemination for serotype VI. Multilocus sequence typing analysis of the major clones identified ST12 for serotype Ib and ST1 for serotypes V and VI. CONCLUSION: Rapid genomic variations with different evolutionary patterns have led to the establishment of serotypes III and VI as the predominant GBS serotypes.
