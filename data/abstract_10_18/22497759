A new class of 1H-benzimidazolecarboxamidines was synthesized and evaluated for in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities, including drug-resistant bacterial strains. The most potent compound (32) has the same ratio of anti-MRSA activity as Vancomycin (minimal inhibitory concentrations value 0.78 mug/mL). The mechanism of action for 1H-benzimidazolecarboxamidine appears to be different from existing antibacterial agents. These compounds have potential for development as a new class of potent anti-MRSA agent.
