Analysis of mcr-1-containing sequences identified a common approximately 2,607-bp DNA segment that in many cases is flanked on one or both ends by ISApl1 We present evidence that mcr-1 is mobilized by an ISApl1 composite transposon which has, in some cases, subsequently lost one or both copies of ISApl1 We also show that mcr-1 can be mobilized in some circumstances by a single upstream copy of ISApl1 in conjunction with the remnants of a downstream ISApl1.
