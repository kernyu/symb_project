INTRODUCTION: The GenoType(R)MTBDRplusV.2 assay is a molecular technique endorsed by the World Health Organization and the Pan American Health Organization that allows for the identification of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and the detection of mutations in the rpobeta gene for rifampicin resistance, and katG and inhA genes for isoniazid resistance. Due to the genetic variability in the circulating strains around the world, the national tuberculosis control programs should assess the performance of these new diagnostic technologies and their use under program conditions as rapid tests. OBJECTIVE: To describe the mutations identified by the GenoType(R)MTBDRplusV.2 assay in pulmonary samples and Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in the Laboratorio Nacional de Referencia of the Instituto Nacional de Salud in 2014. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, descriptive study to detect the expression of inhA, KatG and rpobeta genes, responsible for resistence against isoniazid and rifampicin using the GenoType(R) MTBDRplus V.2 assay in 837 samples and isolates from tuberculosis cases. RESULTS: Several mutations in the rpobeta gene were identified. Ser531Leu was the most frequent (36.6%) followed by Asp516Val (21.6%), while Ser315Thr1 was the most frequent mutation in the katG gene (91.9%). CONCLUSIONS: We were able to identify different mutations present in MDR-TB strains in the country, with frequencies similar to those reported in other countries in the South American region.
