Trichomonas vaginalis is a common sexually transmitted parasite in humans. Metronidazole has been the gold standard for treatment of trichomoniasis. The prevalence of metronidazole resistance and its unpleasant adverse effects drew the attention to the investigation of other lines of treatment, as that of herbal medicine. Garlic has been proven to have antibacterial, antiprotozoal, and antihelminthic activity. The current study was carried out to evaluate the efficacy of commercially available garlic (Tomex(R)) on T. vaginalis in vitro. The effect of different concentrations of garlic (12.5, 25, 50, and 100 mug/ml) was determined on multiplication and motility of trophozoites at different time points (after 24, 48, 72, and 96 h) in comparison to the same concentrations of metronidazole at the same different time points. The results showed that parasite multiplication inhibition was noticed in proportion of concentration of Tomex and incubation time. The minimal lethal concentration of Tomex was 100 mug/ml after 24 h, 50 mug/ml after 48 h, 25 mug/ml after 72 h, and 12.5 mug/ml after 96 h. These results were similar to that of metronidazole as its minimal lethal concentration was 50 mug/ml after 24 and 48 h and 12.5 mug/ml after 72 and 96 h. Garlic had completely inhibited the motility of trophozoites with concentration of 100 mug/ml after 24 h, 50 mug/ml after 48 h, 25 mug/ml after 72 h, and 12.5 mug/ml after 96 h while metronidazole had completely inhibited the motility of trophozoites with concentration of 50 mug/ml after 24 h, 25 mug/ml after 48 h, and 12.5 mug/ml after 72 and 96 h. This suggests that commercially available garlic (Tomex(R)) may be a promising phytotherapeutic agent for trichomoniasis.
