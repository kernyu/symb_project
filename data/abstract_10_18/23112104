UNLABELLED: Precore (PC) (G1896A) and basal core promoter (BCP) (A1762T/G1764A) mutations of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome often emerge in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. Their roles in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion induced by interferon (IFN) therapy remain controversial, partly because quantitative analysis for these mutants is lacking. This study aimed to develop a new assay to accurately quantify the PC and BCP mutant percentages and correlate their dynamic changes with IFN-induced HBeAg seroconversion in HBeAg-positive CHB patients. The PC and BCP mutant percentages were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-pyrosequencing. Our results showed that this quantitative assay for PC and BCP mutants achieved high accuracy (R(2) > 0.99) within a range between 10% and 90% mutants. We examined dynamic changes of the PC and BCP mutant percentages following IFN treatment in 203 HBeAg-positive CHB patients. By multiple logistic regression analysis, we found that the chance of HBeAg seroconversion increased by 2.2% (odds ratio [OR] = 1.022, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.009-1.034, P = 0.001) and 2.3% (OR = 1.023, 95% CI: 1.010-1.037, P = 0.001) per 1% increase of the pretreatment PC and BCP mutant percentages, respectively, after adjustment for other predictors. However, only the pretreatment PC mutation percentage was significantly associated with HBeAg seroconversion with HBV DNA < 2,000 IU/mL (OR = 1.030, 95% CI: 1.014-1.047, P < 0.001). Furthermore, the mutant percentage of PC, but not BCP, in patients achieving HBeAg seroclearance with HBV DNA < 20,000 IU/mL increased significantly during IFN treatment (P = 0.039). Interestingly, patients with HBeAg seroconversion who had a high PC mutant percentage at the end of IFN treatment tended to exhibit high viremia after seroconversion. CONCLUSION: Quantitative analysis of PC and BCP mutants can predict IFN-induced HBeAg seroconversion and demonstrate their distinct evolution patterns during HBeAg seroconversion. (HEPATOLOGY 2013).
