Candida albicans biofilms are surface-associated, structured communities composed of yeast, hyphal, and pseudohyphal cells surrounded by an extracellular matrix. C. albicans biofilms often lead to life-threatening systemic infections and are particularly difficult to eradicate because of their high levels of resistance to antibiotics. Farnesol, an autoregulatory molecule secreted by C. albicans, inhibits hyphal growth and the expression of a number of morphology-specific genes that are necessary for robust biofilm formation. Many stages of biofilm development are impacted by farnesol including the adherence of cells to the substratum, the architecture of mature biofilms, and the dispersal of cells from biofilms. For these reasons, understanding the mechanisms of action of farnesol could lead to the development of new antifungal compounds that target C. albicans biofilm cells, perhaps rendering biofilms more sensitive to antibiotics. Here, we describe several methods for the analysis of the effects of farnesol on biofilm formation and function.
