Resistance to chemotherapeutics used in the treatment of urinary tract infection is increasing throughout the world. Taking into account clinical experiences, as well as current bacterial resistance in Croatia and neighboring countries, the selection of antibiotic should be the optimal one. Treatment of urinary tract infection in children is particularly demanding due to their age and inclination to severe systemic reaction and renal scarring. If parenteral antibiotics are administered initially, it should be switched to oral medication as soon as possible. Financial aspects of antimicrobial therapy are also very important with the main goal to seek the optimal cost/benefit ratio. Financial orientation must appreciate the basic primum non nocere as a conditio sine qua non postulate as well.
