Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important pathogen that has been implicated in a number of serious conditions in humans and animals. Studies regarding the efficacy of antimicrobial drugs against virulent strains of P. aeruginosa in human and animal hosts have demonstrated that common therapeutic options are sometimes ineffective. In captive animals, in particular reptiles, literature on this topic is scarce. In this study, a 6-yr-old monitor lizard, Varanus niloticus, died suddenly without previous symptoms. Postmortem examination and bacteriologic analysis of necropsy samples revealed severe fibrinonecrotic enteritis caused by P. aeruginosa. The isolate presented a typical resistance profile, showing resistance to amoxycillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cephotaxime, and sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim. Virulence characterization demonstrated that the bacterium was able to express hemolysins, DNases, gelatinases, and lipases and had biofilm-forming ability. This study highlights the importance of surveillance for antimicrobial resistance and virulence traits in captive animals, which may present a challenge to practitioners.
