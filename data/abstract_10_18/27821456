We reviewed 37 patients treated for bacteremia due to carbapenem-resistant (CR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa Although 65% of isolates were multiple-drug resistant, therapeutic options were available, as all were susceptible to >/=1 antibiotic. A total of 92% of patients received active antimicrobial therapy, but only 57% received early active therapy (within 48 h). Fourteen-day mortality was 19%. Microbiologic failure occurred in 29%. The Pitt bacteremia score (P = 0.046) and delayed active therapy (P = 0.027) were predictive of death and microbiologic failure, respectively.
