The evaluation of influence biocides on phenomenon of spread resistance bacteria is wide discussed particularly in the medical area. Current issue is examinated mechanisms of spread bacterial resistance in the areas using antibiotics and disinfectants and in natural environment. Selection of resistance bacteria is connected with using biocides against the rules in medical care and disinfection. Biocides using in static concentrations do not act as bacteriocidal substances and contribute to survival rate of resistance bacteria. Disinfectants use correctly to the areas and in right using concentrations prevent spread of resistance bacteria.
