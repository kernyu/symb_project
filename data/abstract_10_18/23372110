BACKGROUND: Raltegravir (RAL) constitutes the first available integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) available in clinical practice. Three independent pathways have been described to confer resistance to RAL. Secondary mutations with little effect on INSTI susceptibility and additional substitutions with an uncertain role have also been described especially in HIV-1 non-B variants. METHODS: We evaluated the prevalence of primary, secondary, and additional resistance mutations to INSTIs in patients naive to RAL or elvitegravir (EGV) carrying different HIV-1 variants. RESULTS: A total of 83 patients infected by B HIV-1 subtype (64%) or non-B HIV-1 variants (36%) were evaluated. No primary mutations to RAL or EGV were found in the inte-grase sequences analyzed. Secondary mutations were detected in only 5 patients. Additional mutations were found in both in B and non-B variants. According to the geno2pheno algorithm, some of the secondary mutations detected (L74V, E138K, G163RS, and V151I) have been associated with a reduced estimated susceptibility to RAL and only the E138K mutation has been associated with a decreased estimated susceptibility to EGV. No virological failure was observed after RAL was administrated in 17 patients carrying 1 or more additional substitutions in the absence of primary or secondary mutations. CONCLUSIONS: No primary resistance mutations to INSTI were found in treatment-naive or -experienced patients infected with B or non-B HIV-1 variants. The vast majority had some polymorphic and non-polymorphic substitutions; however response to RAL was excellent in patients who harbored one or more of these mutations. We could not identify any clinical factors associated with the presence of any of these mutations.
