This report describes one case of verified treatment failure of pharyngeal gonorrhoea using ceftriaxone in Sweden. Previous reports described verified treatment failure of urogenital gonorrhoea using the internationally recommended first-line drug cefixime, but not with ceftriaxone, the last remaining option for empirical treatment of gonorrhoea. Enhanced awareness of clinical failures, pharmacodynamic considerations, follow-up and test of cure, adherence to appropriate case management and treatment guidelines as well as verification/falsification of presumed clinical treatment failures should be emphasised worldwide.
