Due to heightened awareness regarding testing for and eradication of infection, the prevalence and incidence of H pylori infection (and by extension the prevalence and incidence of peptic ulcer disease) appear to have declined in recent years. However, antimicrobial resistance is mounting and traditional clarithromycin- or metronidazole-containing triple therapies may no longer be highly effective at eradicating the infection. Combined bismuth- and metronidazole-containing quadruple therapy or sequential 4-drug therapy may be better choices for first-line treatment against this unique pathogen that is ideally suited to survive in the human stomach.
