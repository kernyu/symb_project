The peroxisome plays an essential role in eukaryotic cellular metabolism, including beta-oxidation of fatty acids and detoxification of hydrogen peroxide. However, its functions in the important fungal pathogen, C. albicans, remain to be investigated. In this study, we identified a homologue of Saccharomyces cerevisiae peroxisomal protein Pex1 in this pathogen, and explored its functions in stress tolerance. Fluorescence observation revealed that C. albicans Pex1 was localized in the peroxisomes, and its loss led to the defect in peroxisome formation. Interestingly, the pex1Delta/Delta mutant had increased tolerance to oxidative stress, which was neither associated with the Cap1 pathway, nor related to the altered distribution of catalase. However, under oxidative stress, the pex1Delta/Delta mutant showed increased expression of autophagy-related genes, with enhanced cytoplasm-to-vacuole transport and degradation of the autophagy markers Atg8 and Lap41. Moreover, the double mutants pex1Delta/Deltaatg8Delta/Delta and pex1Delta/Deltaatg1Delta/Delta, both of which were defective in autophagy and peroxisome formation, showed remarkable attenuated tolerance to oxidative stress. These results indicated that autophagy is involved in resistance to oxidative stress in pex1Delta/Delta mutant. Taken together, this study provides evidence that the peroxisomal protein Pex1 regulates oxidative stress tolerance in an autophagy-dependent manner in C. albicans.
