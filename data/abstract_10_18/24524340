Hydroxyurea (HU) has traditionally been the first-line treatment for patients with polycythemia vera (PV) or essential thrombocythemia (ET) at high risk for vascular complications. However, approximately 20-25% of patients develop resistance or intolerance to HU and must be treated with second-line therapies. Resistance is associated with disease transformation and reduced survival. However, given the dearth of large-scale controlled clinical trials in this patient population, there is no clear consensus on how to best treat patients who develop resistance or intolerance to HU. Herein, we review current literature on treatment options for patients with HU-refractory/resistant PV or ET and provide recommendations for treating these patients.
