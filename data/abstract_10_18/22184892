The aim of this study was to assess the ability of slime production ofcoagulase-negative staphylococci (CONS) and evaluate the susceptibility of bacteria to antibiotics. Strains were isolated from clinical specimens obtained from hospitalized patients. The most frequently isolated species were S. epidermidis (51%), S. hominis (18%), S. haemolyticus (13%). The result of this study shows that 61% of S.epidermidis produce slime on CRA (Congo red agar), whereas none of the tested S. haemolyticus strains has this ability. All examined strains were susceptible to vancomycin, linezolid and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. The majority of strains were susceptible to minocycline, fusid acid, nitrofurantoin and rifampicin. Sixty six percent of isolates were determined as methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci.
