INTRODUCTION: Escherichia coli (E. coli) peritonitis is a frequent, serious complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD). The extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli peritonitis is associated with poorer prognosis and its incidence has been on continuous increase during the last decades. However, the clinical course and outcomes of E. coli peritonitis remain largely unclear. METHODS: All of the E. coli peritonitis episodes that occurred in our dialysis unit from 2006 to 2011 were reviewed. The polymicrobial episodes were excluded. RESULTS: In total, ninety episodes of monomicrobial E. coli peritonitis occurred in 68 individuals, corresponding to a rate of 0.027 episodes per patient-year. E. coli was the leading cause (59.2%) of monomicrobial gram-negative peritonitis. ESBL-producing strains accounted for 35.5% of E. coli peritonitis. The complete cure rate and treatment failure rate of E. coli peritonitis were 77.8% and 10.0% respectively. Patients with preceding peritonitis had a higher risk of ESBL production as compared to those without peritonitis history [odds ratio (OR): 5.286; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.018 - 13.843; p = 0.001]. The risk of treatment failure was significantly increased when the patient had a baseline score of Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) above 3 (OR: 6.155; 95% CI: 1.198 - 31.612; p = 0.03), or had diabetes mellitus (OR: 8.457; 95% CI: 1.838 - 38.91; p = 0.006), or hypoalbuminemia (</= 30g/l) on admission (OR: 13.714; 95% CI: 1.602 - 117.428; p = 0.01). Prolonging the treatment course from 2 to 3 weeks or more reduced the risk of relapse and repeat significantly (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: E. coli peritonitis remains a common complication of PD. The clinical outcomes of E. coli peritonitis are relatively favorable despite the high ESBL rate. A history of peritonitis is associated with increased risk for ESBL development. The severity of baseline comorbidities, the presence of diabetes mellitus and hypoalbuminemia at admission are associated with poor outcomes.
