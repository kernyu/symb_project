The increasing emergence of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. worldwide has resulted in the limited availability of effective antimicrobial agents and has become a major public health concern. In this study, the draft genome sequence of Acinetobacter pittii TCM292 belonging to sequence type 207 (ST207), a multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolate harbouring the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase blaNDM-1 gene, was determined using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. The genome sequence was analysed by bioinformatics methods. The A. pittii TCM292 genome size was estimated to be 3791758bp with 3486 predicted coding regions. These data might facilitate further understanding of the specific genomic features of MDR A. pittii in China.
