We describe the isolation of an NDM-1-producing Acinetobacter baumannii in a Czech patient repatriated in July 2011 from Egypt. The infection spread to another patient on the same ward. Both isolates showed the same resistance pattern and were susceptible only to colistin. They had an identical PFGE pattern and belonged to the same sequence type ST 1. Sequencing of the blaNDM gene identified the NDM-1 variant of the carbapenemase, surrounded by two copies of insertion sequence ISAba125.
