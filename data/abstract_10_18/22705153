Type I interferons (IFN-alpha/beta) serve as the first line of defense against viral infection and share the same type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) complex, which is composed of IFNAR1 and -2. The Eastern woodchuck (Marmota monax) and Chinese woodchuck (Marmota himalayana) are suitable for studying hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Here, the complete or partial sequences of the IFNARs of both species were obtained and analyzed. Small interference RNAs targeting wIFNAR1 and -2 specifically down-regulated the expression of wIFNAR1 and -2 and the IFN-stimulated gene MxA in a woodchuck cell line, respectively. IFNAR2 was significantly up-regulated in primary woodchuck hepatocytes stimulated with IFN-alpha or -gamma. The expression of woodchuck IFNAR1 and -2 was decreased in woodchucks chronically infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV). These results are essential for studying type I IFN-related innate immunity and therapy in hepadnaviral infection in the woodchuck model.
