BACKGROUND: Outcome of pediatric cancers has significantly improved with modern chemotherapy and good supportive care. However, febrile neutropenia remains one of the important limiting factors in these patients especially with the emergence of resistant organisms. Choosing appropriate antimicrobials is possible only if we understand the local microbial spectrum and their sensitivity pattern. AIMS: To study the likely etiologic agents and their antibiotic sensitivity pattern among systemic infections in children with cancer. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This is a prospective study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted at a tertiary care center for pediatrics, in which culture samples representing blood stream infections and others like urinary tract infections sent from the Oncology services of the Hospital during the year of 2013 were analyzed. The microbiological profile and antibiotic sensitivity pattern of these isolates were studied. RESULTS: There were 89 isolates that represented blood and urinary tract infections in neutropenic patients with cancer.Out of 89 positive cultures 76 were gram negative isolates. The most common gram negative bacterial isolates were Escherichia coli 33 (37%), followed by Pseudomonas 21 (23.5%). Acinetobacter grew in 2 patients (2.2%). Extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL's), carbepenem resistant and pan-resistant organisms seen in 28 (31.4%), 5 (5.6%) and 2 cases (2.3%) respectively. Over all Gram-positive organisms were 13/89 (12.3%). Staphylococcus was the most common Gram-positive organism and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus seen in 5 each. CONCLUSION: Gram-negative organism is a common isolate in cancer children with febrile neutropenia, which is resistant to first-line antibiotic cefepime. Meropenem is most sensitive antibiotic and ESBL's are sensitive to piperacillin-tazobactam.
