Two macrolide glycosides with a unique scaffold were isolated from cultures of the myxobacterium Pyxidicoccus fallax. Their structures, including absolute configurations, were elucidated by a combination of NMR, MS, degradation, and molecular modeling techniques. Analysis of the proposed biosynthetic gene cluster led to insights into the biosynthesis of the polyketide and confirmed the structure assignment. The more active compound, disciformycin B, potently inhibits methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
