IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: New antibiotics are needed to overcome microbial resistance and to improve on the therapeutic index and clinical effectiveness of existing agents. AREA COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: This review covers the journal and patent literature published from about the mid-2000s to 2010 to provide an overview of the large diversity of new chemical entities in the macrolide, lincosaminide and streptogramin B (MLS(B)) class. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: The review identifies areas of the greatest effort and recent results in pursuing structure-activity relationships among MLS(B) antibiotics and highlights preclinical and clinical candidates that have arisen from these diverse discovery programs. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Research on the MLS(B) class appears promising for the eventual registration and commercialization of several new antibiotics that improve the clinical effectiveness of existing agents and combat antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
