In this paper, we explored the protective effect and physiochemical mechanism of He-Ne laser preillumination in enhancement of tall fescue seedlings tolerance to high salt stress. The results showed that salt stress greatly reduced plant growth, plant height, biomass, leaf development, ascorbate acid (AsA) and glutathione (GSH) concentration, the enzymatic activities, and gene expression levels of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GR) and enhanced hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content, superoxide radical (O2 (.-)) generation rates, membrane lipid peroxidation, relative electrolyte leakage, the enzymatic activities, and gene expression levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and peroxidase (POD), compared with controls. However, He-Ne laser preillumination significantly reversed plant growth retardation, biomass loss, and leaves development decay induced by salt stress. And the values of the physiochemical parameters observed in salt-stressed plants were partially reverted or further increased by He-Ne laser. Salt stress had no obvious effect on the transcriptional activity of phytochromeB, whereas He-Ne laser markedly enhanced its transcriptional level. Preillumination with white fluorescent lamps (W), red light (RL) of the same wavelength, or RL, then far-red light (FRL) had not alleviated the inhibitory effect of salt stress on plant growth and antioxidant enzymes activities, suggesting that the effect of He-Ne laser on improved salt tolerance was most likely attributed to the induction of phytochromeB transcription activities by the laser preillumination, but not RL, FRL or other light sources. In addition, we also utilized sodium nitroprusside (SNP) as NO donor to pre-treat tall fescue seedlings at the same conditions, and further evaluated the differences of physiological effects between He-Ne laser and NO in increasing salt resistance of tall fescue. Taken together, our data illustrated that He-Ne laser preillumination contributed to conferring an increased tolerance to salt stress in tall fescue seedlings due to alleviating oxidative damage through scavenging free radicals and inducing transcriptional activities of some genes involved in plant antioxidant system, and the induction of phytochromeB transcriptional level by He-Ne laser was probably correlated with these processes. Moreover, this positive physiochemical effect seemed more effective with He-Ne laser than NO molecule.
