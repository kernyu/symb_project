Treating intracellular pathogens remains a considerable medical challenge because of the inefficient intracellular delivery of antimicrobials and the frequent emergence of bacterial resistance to therapeutic agents deemed the drugs of last resort. We investigated the capability of antisense peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) conjugated to the (KFF)3K cell penetrating peptide to target RNA polymerase alpha subunit (rpoA) and RNA polymerase sigma 70 (rpoD) in the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. The PNAs tested displayed a concentration dependent inhibition of L. monocytogenes growth in pure culture at the micromolar level and significantly reduced intracellular L. monocytogenes in infected cell culture and Caenorhabditis elegans whole animal model. In vitro, the combined PNAs treatment was synergistic resulting in a clearance of L. monocytogenes at 0.5x the individual PNA concentration. This study demonstrates the potential of anti-rpoA PNA as an antibacterial agent and will provide the basis for improving and developing these PNAs to better target intracellular pathogens like Listeria. This study also establishes C. elegans as a potential model for the screening of PNAs.
