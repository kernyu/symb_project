Omadacycline is a novel aminomethylcycline antibiotic in clinical development for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). We used a neutropenic murine pneumonia infection model to characterize the in vivo pharmacodynamic activity of omadacycline against Streptococcus pneumoniae Four strains with various phenotypic resistances to other antimicrobials, including tetracyclines, were utilized. Drug concentration measurements were performed in the plasma and epithelial lining fluid (ELF) after administration of 0.5, 2, 8, and 32 mg/kg. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using a noncompartmental model and were linear over the dose range. Penetration into ELF ranged from 72 to 102%. Omadacycline demonstrated net cidal activity in relation to the initial burden against all four strains. The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic index AUC/MIC correlated well with efficacy (R(2) = 0.74). The plasma 24-h static dose AUC/MIC values were 16 to 20 (24-h ELF AUC/MIC of 14 to 18). A 1-log10 kill was achieved at 24-h plasma AUC/MIC values of 6.1 to 180 (24-h ELF AUC/MIC values 6.0 to 200). A 2-log10 kill was achieved at 24-h plasma AUC/MIC values of 19 to 56 (24-h ELF AUC/MIC of 17 to 47). The targets identified in this study in combination with in vitro potency and favorable human pharmacokinetics make omadacycline an attractive candidate for further development and study in patients with CABP.
