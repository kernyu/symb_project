The objective was to determine multidrug-resistant organisms' (MDROs) profile in diabetic foot ulcers (DFU), antibiotic resistance of MDROs, and to find the potential risk factors for infection with MDROs. In 157 patients with DFU admitted to Tianjin Metabolic Disease Hospital, China, from January 2011 to January 2012, microbiological specimens were taken on admission. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the infection of MDROs. Potential risk factors for MDRO-positive specimens were examined using univariate and multivariate analyses. Seventy-eight MDRO strains were isolated from patients in the MDRO+ group, among which the top 3 were Staphylococcus aureus (16.7%), Enterobacter spp (16.7%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.4%). Most of the MDROs were resistant to at least 8 kinds of commonly used antibiotics. Gram-negative MDROs showed 23% to 50% resistance to third-generation cephalosporins. The resistant rates of Gram-positive MDROs to fluoroquinolone were more than 70%; penicillin and semisynthetic penicillin were 57% to 100% resistant. Previous hospitalization (odds ratio [OR] = 3.000; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.100-8.182; P = .032), previous duration of antibiotic therapy (OR = 1.078; 95% CI = 1.001-1.160; P = .046), ulcer type (OR = 7.185; 95% CI = 2.115-24.408; P = .002), ulcer size (OR = 1.403; 95% CI = 1.042-1.888; P = .026), and osteomyelitis (OR = 3.390; 95% CI = 1.178-9.756; P = .024) were associated with MDRO infection in patients with DFU.
