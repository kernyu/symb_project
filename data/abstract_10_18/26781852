While nisin (lantibiotic), lacticin 3147 (lantibiotic) and vancomycin (glycopeptides) are among the best studied lipid II-binding antimicrobials, their relative activities have never been compared. Nisin and lacticin 3147 have been employed/investigated primarily as food preservatives, although they do have potential in terms of veterinary and clinical applications. Vancomycin is used exclusively in clinical therapy. We reveal a higher potency for lacticin 3147 (MIC 0.95-3.8 mug/ml) and vancomycin (MIC 0.78-1.56 mug/ml) relative to that of nisin (MIC 6.28-25.14 mug/ml) against the food-borne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. A comparison of the activity of the three antimicrobials against nisin resistance mutants of L. monocytogenes also reveals that their susceptibility to vancomycin and lacticin 3147 changed only slightly or not at all. A further assessment of relative activity against a selection of Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus and Staphylococcus aureus targets revealed that vancomycin MICs consistently ranged between 0.78 and 1.56 mug/ml against all but one strain. Lacticin 3147 was found to be more effective than nisin against B. cereus (lacticin 3147 MIC 1.9-3.8 mug/ml; nisin MIC 4.1-16.7 mug/ml) and E. faecium and E. faecalis targets (lacticin 3147 MIC from 1.9 to 3.8 mug/ml; nisin MIC >/=8.3 mug/ml). The greater effectiveness of lacticin 3147 is even more impressive when expressed as molar values. However, in agreement with the previous reports, nisin was the more effective of the two lantibiotics against S. aureus strains. This study highlights that in many instances the antimicrobial activity of these leading lantibiotics are comparable with that of vancomycin and emphasizes their particular value with respect to use in situations including foods and veterinary medicine, where the use of vancomycin is not permitted.
