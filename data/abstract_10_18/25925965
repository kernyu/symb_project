UNLABELLED: Although cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) are rare, they can enter a non-proliferative or dormant state and resist therapy. Furthermore, quiescent CSCs are responsible for metastases that can appear after curative surgical treatment of a primary tumor. Because of drug resistance of CSCs, the development of novel therapies is urgently required that specifically target CSCs. PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential of a panel of natural products and derivatives to inhibit CSC-enriched mammospheres of MCF-7 breast cancer cells. METHODS: CD44(high)/CD24(low) cells were identified by flow cytometry and maintained as mammospheres. As a control, we used two clinically established anticancer drugs (5-fluorouracil and docetaxel). A panel of natural products, shikonin, two cajanin stilbene acid (CSA) derivatives and artesunate were tested by resazurin assay on CSC-enriched mammospheres and MCF-7 monolayer cells. Besides, cellular shikonin uptake experiments were performed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: We found two CSA derivatives (Nos. 6 and 19) to be active cancer stem-like MCF-7 mammospheres. Especially, CSA derivative No. 19 clearly showed collateral sensitivity in mammospheres compared to monolayer cells. CONCLUSION: Phytochemicals which provoke collateral sensitivity in cancer-stem like cells are worth more detailed investigations in the future, since there is a great potential for improved chemotherapy to eradicate tumors and prolong cancer patients' survival times.
