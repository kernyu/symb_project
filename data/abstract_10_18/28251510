PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The increase in drug-resistant community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is an important problem all over the world. This article explores the current state of antimicrobial resistance of different bacteria that cause CAP and also assesses risk factors to identify those pathogens. RECENT FINDINGS: In the last two decades, it has been documented that there is a significant increase in drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and other bacteria causing CAP. The most important risk factors are overuse of antibiotics, prior hospitalization, and lung comorbidities. The direct consequences can be severe, including prolonged stays in hospital, increased costs, and morbi-mortality. However, drug-resistant CAP declined after the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. This review found an increase in resistance to the antibiotics used in CAP, and the risk factor can be used for identifying patients with drug-resistant CAP and initiate appropriate treatment. Judicious use of antibiotics and the development of effective new vaccines are needed.
