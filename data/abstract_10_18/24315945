This research report was to develop Cefixime loaded polylactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) nanoparticles using modified precipitation method. TEM analysis indicated formation of well-formed, smooth, spherical nanoparticles with no aggregates whereas XRD recommended dispersion of drug in PLGA carrier system in amorphous form. The polymer and stabilizer concentration and organic to aqueous ratio were found to be significant factors for nanoparticles and their optimization using Taguchi design (L9). The design formulations showed entrapment efficiency (EE), particle size and poly-dispersity index (PDI) ranging 68.31 +/- 1.74%, 159.8-157.7 nm and 0.126-0.149, respectively indicated small and stable nanoparticles with good homogeneity and encapsulation. The design optimized formulation drug release and permeation studies demonstrated that it is four times sustained release behavior and 1.74 times better permeation than free drug. The result of microbiological assay also suggested that optimized formulation has significant antibacterial activity against intracellular multidrug resistance (MDR) of Salmonella typhi.
