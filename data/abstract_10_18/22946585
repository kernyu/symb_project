The upregulation of pteridine reductase (PTR1) is a major contributor to antifolate drug resistance in Leishmania spp., as it provides a salvage pathway that bypasses dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibition. The structure-based optimization of the PTR1 inhibitor methyl-1-[4-(2,4-diaminopteridin-6-ylmethylamino)benzoyl]piperidine-4-carboxylate (1) led to the synthesis of a focused compound library which showed significantly improved selectivity for the parasite's folate-dependent enzyme. When used in combination with pyrimethamine, a DHFR inhibitor, a synergistic effect was observed for compound 5b. This work represents a step forward in the identification of effective antileishmania agents.
