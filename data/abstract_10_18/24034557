Infections related to fungal biofilms are difficult to treat due to the reduced susceptibility of sessile cells to most antifungal agents. Previous research has shown that 1-10% of sessile Candida cells survive treatment with high doses of miconazole (a fungicidal imidazole). The aim of this study was to identify genes involved in fungal biofilm formation and to unravel the mechanisms of resistance of these biofilms to miconazole. To this end, a screening of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae deletion mutant bank was carried out. Our results revealed that genes involved in peroxisomal transport and the biogenesis of the respiratory chain complex IV play an essential role in biofilm formation. On the other hand, genes involved in transcription and peroxisomal and mitochondrial organization seem to highly influence the susceptibility to miconazole of yeast biofilms. Additionally, our data confirm previous findings on genes involved in biofilm formation and in general stress responses. Our data suggest the involvement of peroxisomes in biofilm formation and miconazole resistance in fungal biofilms.
