In this study we determined the prevalence of genes coding for antimicrobial resistance, toxins, enzymes, immunoevasion and adhesins factors among 189 meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains isolated from a third level hospital in Valladolid (Spain) between 2005 and 2008 in order to examine the relationship between these pathogenicity determinants, both individually and in combination, and the genetic background of main MRSA strains that are presents in Spanish hospitals. MRSA isolates were first characterised epidemiologically by a combination of molecular typing strategies like spa, SCCmec and multilocus sequence typing, and then, a cluster analysis based on pathogenicity factors genes was performed according to the hybridisation pattern of 65 virulence, 36 resistance, 15 adhesins, and 11 set/ssl genes on a Diagnostic DNA microarray (Alere StaphyType DNA microarray Jena, Germany). CC5-agr type II [ST125-SCCmecIV/VI (32.2%) or ST125-IV (19.1%), ST228-I (19.1%), ST146-IV (13.7%) and ST5- IV (0.5%)] isolates was widely distributed. CC8-agr type I [ST8-IV (11.5%), USA300 clone (0.5%), and ST239-III (1.1%)]; CC45-agr type II [ST45- IV (1.6%)], and the CC97-agr type I [ST97-IV] were also detected. We identified 42 different resistance genes profiles, 22 set/ssl genes profiles, and 91 different virulence profiles. However although the high genetic diversity of MRSA strains, mainly with respect to virulence factors genes, the results of the simultaneous assessment of resistance and virulence genes and the genetic background illustrated a correspondence relationship (p<0.001) between the different clones and same resistance and virulence genes or clusters of them. During the study period we observed changes in molecular epidemiology of MRSA isolates and as a consequence we report the changes of the resistance and virulence potential of MRSA strains produced over time in our institution.
