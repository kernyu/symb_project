CCR5 blockers inhibit CCR5-tropic (R5) HIV-1, including strains resistant to other antiretrovirals. We demonstrate that the CCR5 antibody HGS004 and the CCR5 antagonist maraviroc have potent antiviral synergy against R5 HIV-1, translating into dose reductions of more than 10-fold for maraviroc and more than 150-fold for HGS004. These data, together with the high barrier of resistance to HGS004, suggest that combinations of maraviroc and HGS004 could provide effective preventive and therapeutic strategies against R5 HIV-1.
