EDP-239, a novel hepatitis C virus (HCV) inhibitor targeting nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A), has been investigated in vitro and in vivo EDP-239 is a potent, selective inhibitor with potency at picomolar to nanomolar concentrations against HCV genotypes 1 through 6. In the presence of human serum, the potency of EDP-239 was reduced by less than 4-fold. EDP-239 is additive to synergistic with other direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) or host-targeted antivirals (HTAs) in blocking HCV replication and suppresses the selection of resistance in vitro Furthermore, EDP-239 retains potency against known DAA- or HTA-resistant variants, with half-maximal effective concentrations (EC50s) equivalent to those for the wild type. In a phase I, single-ascending-dose, placebo-controlled clinical trial, EDP-239 demonstrated excellent pharmacokinetic properties that supported once daily dosing. A single 100-mg dose of EDP-239 resulted in reductions in HCV genotype 1a viral RNA of >3 log10 IU/ml within the first 48 h after dosing and reductions in genotype 1b viral RNA of >4-log10 IU/ml within 96 h.
