The increasing use of carbapenems for treating multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacterial infections has contributed to the global dissemination of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). Serine and metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) that hydrolyze carbapenems have become prevalent and endemic in some countries, necessitating the use of older classes of agents, such as colistin. A total of 19,719 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae (excluding Proteeae and Serratia spp., which have innate resistance to colistin) were collected from infected patients during 2012 and 2013 in a global surveillance program and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using CLSI methods. Isolates of CRE were characterized for carbapenemases and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) by PCR and sequencing. Using EUCAST breakpoints, the rate of colistin susceptibility was 98.4% overall, but it was reduced to 88.0% among 482 carbapenemase-positive isolates. Colistin susceptibility was higher among MBL-positive isolates (92.6%) than those positive for a KPC (87.9%) or OXA-48 (84.2%). Of the agents tested, only tigecycline (MIC90, 2 to 4 mug/ml) and aztreonam-avibactam (MIC90, 0.5 to 1 mug/ml) consistently tested with low MIC values against colistin-resistant, ESBL-positive, and carbapenemase-positive isolates. Among the 309 (1.6%) colistin-resistant isolates from 10 species collected in 38 countries, 58 carried a carbapenemase that included KPCs (38 isolates), MBLs (6 isolates), and OXA-48 (12 isolates). These isolates were distributed globally (16 countries), and 95% were Klebsiella pneumoniae. Thirty-nine (67.2%) isolates carried additional ESBL variants of CTX-M, SHV, and VEB. This sample of Enterobacteriaceae demonstrated a low prevalence of colistin resistance overall. However, the wide geographic dispersion of colistin resistance within diverse genus and species groups and the higher incidence observed among carbapenemase-producing MDR pathogens are concerning.
