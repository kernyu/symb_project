Environmental fungicides are used in agriculture to reduce fungal spoilage of crop to a minimum and the polyene macrolide natamycin is used as a food preservative. The use of natamycin in yoghurt has recently been authorized in the USA and some other countries. However, resistance development is a serious risk associated with the use of antimicrobials as food additives and environmental fungicides. Cross-resistance between agricultural and medical azoles and amphothericin B, respectively, not being used in agriculture has been demonstrated in clinical and environmental isolates. Polyene resistance could be elicited in vitro by the use of subinhibitory polyene concentrations and a large number of transfers. This condition may mirror the exposition of faecal Candida species to natamycin following consumption of natamycin containing food. A large number of environmental and clinical isolates were amphothericin B resistant and strong evidence linking farm antibiotic use and multi drug resistance including amphothericin B resistance in human infections has been provided. In contrast to the acquisition of resistant environmental strains, consumption of natamycin containing food may expose the gastrointestinal fungal flora directly to the resistance selective pressure. So far, the question if natamycin in itself may cause emergence of polyene-resistance in the gastrointestinal fungal flora and/or may act as an amphothericin B resistance selector may be probable but is speculative. The use of any anti-infective agent as a food-preservative should be limited to an absolute minimum as clinical efficacy of antiinfectives used to treat serious, life threatening infections has to be preserved.
