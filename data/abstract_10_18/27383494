To analyze the bacterial infection situations and the separation situations of multiple drug-resistant bacteria of the neurology of Zhengzhou People's hospital from Feb. 2012 to Dec. 2014. The patients data of neurology were retrieved by means of the doctor workstation system. The infection sites, the classification and drug-resistant feature of bacteria were classified and summarized in Excel. Finally, Compared with the infection sites, the classification and drug-resistant feature of bacteria at different year. The data obtained use SPSS 19.0 software to do statistical analysis. The infection rate of bacteria in neurology from Year 2012 to 2014 declined from 4.99% to 3.41%. But the constitution of the infection sites of bacteria had no significant changes. Staphylococcus aureus still was the majority in the infections of gram-positive bacteria, and Escherichia coli was the majority in the infections of gram-negative bacteria, and there were no significant changes in the ranking of the past three years. The separation rate of Acihetobacter baumanii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in gram-negative bacteria gradually escalated. There were definite efficiencies in the prevention and control of the bacterial infections in neurology in the past three years. But the situation of prevention and control was still severe at the same time.
