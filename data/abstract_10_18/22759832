This study revealed the antipathogenic potential of natural compounds present in the edible fruits against urinary pathogen Serratia marcescens by using quorum sensing inhibition (QSI). The serum resistance assay was adopted to examine the immunomodulatory effects of QSI compounds to fight against bacterial infections.
