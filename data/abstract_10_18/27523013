We herein report the first domestic case of bacteremia caused by an intrinsic strain of colistin-resistant Acinetobacter. The Acinetobacter species was detected in the hemocultures in a febrile patient. The patient was a 65-year-old-man who was admitted to our hospital for laparotomic gastrostomy. The patient's antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were atypical; they were colistin resistant but not multiple drug resistant. A sequence analysis of rpoB identified the bacterium as an Acinetobacter genomic species 13BJ/14TU, which had only been previously reported in South Korea. He had never traveled to South Korea but frequently had contact with the South Korean community. We therefore demonstrated that infection with this species could occur in domestic cases.
