The aim of the study was to estimate the functional activity of neutrophilic granulocytes after the contact with MSSA and MRSA. It was determined by luminol-dependent chemoluminescence with stimulation by the priming doses of MRSA and MSSA. The functional activity of neutrophilic granulocytes was shown to increase in response to either the resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains or the susceptible ones. It should be indicated that the intensity of the oxygen-dependent phagocytosis in response to MRSA was higher than that to MSSA.
