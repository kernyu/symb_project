The treatment ofStenotrophomonas maltophiliainfection with beta-lactam antibiotics leads to increased release of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), which are packed with two chromosomally encoded beta-lactamases. Here, we show that these beta-lactamase-packed OMVs are capable of establishing extracellular beta-lactam degradation. We also show that they dramatically increase the apparent MICs of imipenem and ticarcillin for the cohabituating speciesPseudomonas aeruginosaandBurkholderia cenocepacia.
