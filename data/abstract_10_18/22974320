Integrating conjugative elements (ICEs) of the SXT/R391 family have been described in Vibrios, mainly Vibrio cholerae, and other bacteria as carriers of variable gene content conferring adaptive advantages upon their hosts, including antimicrobial resistance and motility regulation. However, our knowledge on their host range and ecological significance is still limited. Here, we report the identification and characterization of ICEVspPor3 and ICEValSpa1, two novel ICEs of the SXT/R391 family from fish-isolated Vibrio splendidus and Vibrio alginolyticus, respectively. We found that ICEVspPor3 carries tetracycline and HgCl(2) resistance determinants and can be transferred by conjugation to Escherichia coli and to several species of marine bacteria including some of the major bacterial fish pathogens in marine aquaculture, whereas ICEValSpa1 lacks resistance genes. Interestingly, both ICEs harbor genes encoding distinct restriction-modification (RM) systems. We demonstrate here that these RM systems, when expressed in E. coli, confer protection to infection by T1 bacteriophage and by environmental water bacteriophages. Our results provide evidences that the variable gene content of ICEs of the SXT/R391 family encodes fitness functions beyond those related to antimicrobial resistance and motility regulation and suggest that the host range of these elements in the marine environment might be broader than expected.
