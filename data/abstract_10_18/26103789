BACKGROUND: Widespread use of antibiotics has resulted in increased rates of antibiotic resistance and decreased rates of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication, leading to a search for newer therapeutic options. This study aimed to examine the efficacy, tolerability, and patient compliance of a first-line bismuth-containing 5-day concomitant quintuple therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study included 144 eradication treatment naive H. pylori positive patients with dyspeptic complaints. Patients received the following concomitant quintuple therapy for 5 days: bismuth subcitrate 300 mg q.i.d, omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d, clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d., amoxicillin 1 g b.i.d., and metronidazole 500 mg t.i.d. Eradication was assessed with H. pylori stool antigen test or urea-breath test 6 weeks after the completion of therapy. RESULTS: Treatment compliance rate in this study was 97.2%. Intention to treat and per-protocol eradication rates were 134/144 (93.1%, 95% CI, 88.9-97.2) and 134/140 (95.7%, 95% CI, 92.2-98.6), respectively. Side effect was reported by 8.5% of the patients that attended follow-up visits, including epigastric pain (2.8%), nausea/vomiting (2.1%), diarrhea (1.4%), taste disturbance (1.4%), and fatigue (0.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Bismuth-containing, short course, quintuple concomitant therapy appears to be an effective and safe therapeutic option for the first-line H. pylori eradication, particularly in populations with high resistance.
