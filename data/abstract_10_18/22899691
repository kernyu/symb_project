Hundreds of bacterial species inhabit the oral cavity. Many of these have never been cultivated and can be assessed only with DNA-based techniques. This new understanding has changed the paradigm of the etiology of oral disease from that associated with 'traditional pathogens' as being primarily responsible for all diseases. Increasingly, associations between oral bacteria and systemic diseases are being reported. The emergence of antibiotic resistance is alarming and calls for in-depth studies of biofilms, bacterial physiology, and a body-wide approach to infectious diseases. We propose that the borderline between commensal bacteria and pathogens is no longer discrete. In a field of science where so many of the established paradigms are being undermined, a thorough analysis of threats and opportunities is required. This article addresses some of the questions that can be raised and serves to identify research opportunities and needs to leverage the prevention of oral diseases through novel antimicrobial strategies.
