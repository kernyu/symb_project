From 2006 to 2008, Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates were identified with decreased susceptibility to the extended-spectrum cephalosporin (ESC) cefotaxime among visitors of the Amsterdam sexually transmitted infections (STI) clinic, the Netherlands. Spread, clonality, and characteristics of 202 isolates were examined using antibiograms, conventional penA mosaic gene PCR, and N. gonorrhoeae multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (NG-MLVA). A strictly defined subset was further characterized by N. gonorrhoeae multiantigen sequence typing (NG-MAST) and sequencing of ESC resistance determinants (penA, mtrR, and porB1b). Seventy-four N. gonorrhoeae isolates with a cefotaxime MIC of >0.125 mug/ml (group A), 54 with a cefotaxime MIC of 0.125 mug/ml (group B), and a control group of 74 with a cefotaxime MIC of <0.125 mug/ml (group C) were included. Fifty-three clonally related penA mosaic-positive isolates (penicillin-binding protein 2 type XXXIV) were identified in group A (n = 47 isolates; 64%) and B (n = 6 isolates; 11%). The 53 penA mosaic-positive isolates were predominantly NG-MAST ST1407 (87%) and contained an mtrR promoter A deletion (98%) and porB1b alterations G101K/A102N. All were assigned to the same NG-MLVA cluster that comprised in total 56 isolates. A correlation was found between decreased cefotaxime susceptibility and ST1407 that was highly prevalent among visitors of the Amsterdam STI clinic. The rapid spread of this strain, which also has been identified in many other countries, might be facilitated by high-risk sexual behavior and should be monitored closely to identify potential treatment failure. Quality-assured surveillance of ESC susceptibility on the national and international levels and exploration of new drugs and/or strategies for treatment of gonorrhea are crucial.
