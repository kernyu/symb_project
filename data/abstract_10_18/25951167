The Zebrafish Danio rerio is a popular vertebrate model organism used in a wide range of research fields. Importance is placed on Zebrafish health and the maintenance of disease-free laboratory fish so that experimental studies are not inadvertently affected. Mycobacteriosis, a common infection of laboratory Zebrafish, is caused by several Mycobacterium species. Little is known regarding the potential of antibiotic treatment for Zebrafish mycobacteriosis; however, treatment of infected Zebrafish may be appropriate to maintain valuable strains. Here, we investigated, in vitro, the antibiotic susceptibility of both rapid- and slow-growing isolates of Mycobacterium species from laboratory Zebrafish. Antibiotic testing was carried out using a commercially available 96-well microtiter plate format. Results indicated that some but not all antibiotics tested were effective at inhibiting mycobacterial growth and that susceptibility varied among species and strains. Tigecycline, tobramycin, clarithromycin, and amikacin were most effective at broad inhibition of rapid-growing mycobacteria; whereas, amikacin, clarithromycin, and rifampin were effective at inhibiting all slow-growing M. marinum strains tested. Results support the potential for targeted antibiotic treatment of Zebrafish infected with mycobacteria, but additional testing should be carried out in vivo.
