BACKGROUND: Antiviral treatment has improved the short-term outcome of kidney transplant recipients with chronic hepatitis B infection, but its long-term impact, especially in patients who have developed drug resistance, remains uncertain. METHODS: Sixty-three hepatitis B surface antigen positive (HBsAg+) and 63 HBsAg- patients who have undergone kidney transplantation from 1985 to 2008 were retrospectively reviewed and their clinical outcomes were compared. RESULTS: With lamivudine as initial treatment, 62% of patients developed drug resistance after 4 years. Lamivudine resistance was associated with a higher incidence of chronic hepatitis but had no significant impact on liver stiffness score or patient survival during follow-up. Salvage treatment with adefovir or entecavir was well tolerated, and resulted in a three-log decrease in hepatitis B deoxynucleic acid after 6 months and normalization of alanine aminotransferase in 75% of patients. The survival rate of HBsAg+ patients transplanted in the recent era of antiviral treatment was 81% at 10 years. Treatment of hepatitis B with nucleoside/nucleotide analogues resulted in significantly improved patient survival (83% vs. 34% at 20 years, P=0.006). Although antiviral treatment was associated with reduced mortality because of liver complications (P=0.036), liver-related deaths still accounted for 40% of mortalities in HBsAg+ patients in the era of antiviral therapies and 22.2% of all deaths that occurred in patients who had received antiviral treatment. CONCLUSION: Treatment of HBsAg+ renal transplant recipients with nucleoside/nucleotide analogues confers long-term survival benefit, and that rescue therapy with adefovir or entecavir is effective and well tolerated in patients who had developed resistance to lamivudine.
