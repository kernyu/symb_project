BACKGROUND: Daclatasvir (DCV; BMS-790052) is a picomolar inhibitor of HCV non-structural protein 5A (NS5A) and has demonstrated efficacy in patients chronically infected with HCV. METHODS: In the double-blind, randomized studies AI444021 and AI444022, 71 Japanese patients chronically infected with HCV genotype 1 (predominantly genotype 1b) received DCV (10 mg or 60 mg) plus peginterferon alfa-2b or alfa-2a and ribavirin. Virological failure occurred in 14% (5/36) of treatment-naive patients and 54% (19/35) of prior alfa/ribavirin non-responders. Resistance testing was performed on baseline samples and samples with HCV RNA>/=1,000 IU/ml at week 1 through post-treatment week 24. RESULTS: Baseline NS5A resistance-associated polymorphisms had less impact on virological response rates than IL28B genotype. All patients with virological failure had NS5A DCV-resistant variants at the time of failure. The predominant NS5A variants were L31V/M/I plus Y93H; this combination was detected in 100% (5/5) of treatment-naive patients and 74% (14/19) of non-responders with failure. Emergent resistance variants in prior non-responders (four viral breakthroughs, one relapse) were more varied with novel combinations such as L31F-DeltaP32 and L28M-R30Q-A92K detected. Significant loss in DCV antiviral activity was generally only seen with >/= two resistance-associated NS5A substitutions. All DCV-resistant variants were still detected at end of study. CONCLUSIONS: Virological failure in HCV genotype 1b treatment-naive Japanese patients receiving DCV plus alfa-2a/ribavirin or alfa-2b/ribavirin was associated with enrichment of NS5A resistance variants L31V/M-Y93H. In prior non-responders, emergent variants associated with failure also included NS5A-A92K or NS5A-DeltaP32. As with L31-Y93 variants, these variants persisted.
