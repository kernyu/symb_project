Twelve consecutive carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli isolates were recovered from patients (infection or colonization) hospitalized between March and September 2012 in different units at a hospital in Bulgaria. They all produced the carbapenemase NDM-1 and the extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase CTX-M-15, together with the 16S rRNA methylase RmtB, conferring high-level resistance to all aminoglycosides. All those isolates were clonally related and belonged to the same sequence type, ST101. In addition to being the first to identify NDM-producing isolates in Bulgaria, this is the very first study reporting an outbreak of NDM-1-producing E. coli in the world.
