We studied 315 coagulase-negative Staphylococcus strains recovered prospectively during 240 surgical procedures (206 subjects) from proven or suspected device-associated bone and joint infections. Sixteen strains (5.1%) had decreased susceptibility to glycopeptides: 15 (12 S. epidermidis strains, 2 S. capitis strains, and 1 S. haemolyticus strain) to teicoplanin alone (MIC of 16 mg/liter, n = 9; MIC of 32 mg/liter, n = 6) and one (S. epidermidis) to both teicoplanin and vancomycin (MIC, 16 and 8 mg/liter, respectively). Decreased susceptibility to teicoplanin was more prevalent in "infecting" strains (i.e., strains recovered from >/=2 distinct intraoperative samples) than in "contaminants" (i.e., strains not fulfilling this criterion) (8.1% [12/149] versus 2.4% [4/166], respectively [P = 0.022]). One hundred percent (13/13) of S. epidermidis strains with decreased susceptibility to teicoplanin were resistant to methicillin (versus 112/173 [64.7%] for S. epidermidis strains susceptible to teicoplanin; P = 0.021).
