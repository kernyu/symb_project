OBJECTIVE: We established a genetic transformation system for Penicillium brevicompactum to produce mycophenolic acid. METHODS: We developed protoplast transformation methods mediated by Polyethylene glycol, using phleomycin resistance gene (Sh ble) as a dominant selection marker. RESULT: The frequency of transformation was up to 2 - 3 transformants per microg DNA; analysis of the transformants by PCR showed that the foreign DNA had been integrated into the host genome. The transformants retained stable after generation. CONCLUSION: The establishment of the genetic transformation system of Penicillium brevicompactum could serve as the basis for the research of molecular biology and the breeding of gene engineering of the fungus.
