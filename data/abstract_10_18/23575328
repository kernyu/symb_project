BACKGROUND: Drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) is a major public threat in countries of the former Soviet Union, including Georgia. There are few studies of pediatric DR-TB cases, especially at a national level. OBJECTIVE: To report the characteristics and treatment outcomes of pediatric multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) cases in Georgia. METHODS: We extracted data on all pediatric (age <16 years) MDR-TB cases notified in Georgia from 2009 to 2011. We assessed the baseline and treatment characteristics and treatment outcomes of this cohort. RESULTS: Between 2009 and 2011, there were 45 notified pediatric DR-TB cases in Georgia. Just over half had previously received anti-tuberculosis treatment and the median age was 7.7 years. Time from diagnosis to treatment was short (median 16 days), and the median length of treatment was 20.2 months. Of those not still on treatment, 77.1% (95%CI 61.0-87.9) had a successful outcome. CONCLUSIONS: One of the first reports of pediatric DR-TB treatment outcomes at a national level, this study demonstrates that successful outcomes can be achieved.
