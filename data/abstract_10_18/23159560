As the frequent emergence of the resistant bacteria, the development of new agents with a new action mode attracts a great deal of interest. It is now widely accepted that antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics. In this study, antimicrobial peptide polybia-MPI and its analogs were synthesized and their antibacterial activity was studied. Our results revealed that polybia-MPI has potent antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Its ability to make PI permeate into bacteria and lead to the leakage of calcein from model membrane LUVs, suggests a killing mechanism involving membrane perturbation. SEM and TEM microscopy experiments verified that the morphology of bacteria was changed greatly under the treatment of polybia-MPI. Compared with the conventional chemotherapy, polybia-MPI targets the cell membrane rather than entering into the cell to exert its antibacterial activity. Furthermore, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were employed to investigate the mechanism of membrane perturbation. The results indicated that the alpha-helical conformation in the membrane is required for the exhibition of antibacterial activity and the membrane disturbance by polybia-MPI is a cooperative process. In conclusion, with the increasing resistance to conventional antibiotics, there is no doubt that polybia-MPI could offer a new strategy to defend the resistant bacteria.
