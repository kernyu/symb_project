Due to emergence of bacterial resistant strains, the effectiveness of current antibiotic treatment without culture/sensitivity testing is questionable. Our study aims to assess the present sensitivity profiles of Klebsiella isolates from urine samples and provide options for empiric prescription in critically ill patients. Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates collected over a period of 28 months till January 2011 from 1,617 urine samples of subjects presenting with Urinary Tract Infections were identified at a local diagnostic lab using standard protocol and subjected to Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion sensitivity testing. MICs were also estimated by E-nephelometry. Among 20 drugs used, low sensitivity was found to amoxicillin (0.1%), doxycycline (11.5%), nitrofurantoin (15.5%), amoxiclav (18.2%), gentamicin (35.4%), pipemidic acid, cephradine (40.3%) and cotrimoxazole (43.1%). The isolates were more sensitive to cefuroxime (55.9%), cefixime (57.7%), ciprofloxacin (62.5%), ofloxacin (63%), ceftriaxone (66.2%), ceftazidime (66.4%), cefotaxime (66.6%), fosfomycin (77.5%) and amikacin (89.4). Most effective were cefroperazone.sulbactam (95.8%), piperacillin.tazobactam (95.7%) and imipenem (97.7%). Self-medication, lack of awareness, and the misuse of antibiotics by doctors has exacerbated the menace of microbial resistance. The study warrants the prudent choice of drugs in adherence with prevailing sensitivity profiles.
