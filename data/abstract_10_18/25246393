bla(NDM-)5 was found in Escherichia coli strain 0215 from a Chinese patient without travel history. Genomic sequencing and conjugation experiments were performed. Strain 0215 belonged to sequence type 167 (ST167) and had other resistance determinants, including bla(TEM-135), bla(CTX-M-14), and aac(6')-Ib. bla(NDM-5) was carried by a 47-kb self-transmissible IncX3 plasmid and was in a complex genetic context similar to that of bla(NDM-1) on IncX3 plasmids. IncX3 plasmids might have emerged as a common vehicle mediating the spread of bla(NDM).
