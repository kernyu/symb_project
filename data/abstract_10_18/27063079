Malaria is a major global health challenge with 300million new cases every year. The most effective regimen for treating Plasmodium falciparum malaria is based on artemisinin and its derivatives. The drugs are highly effective, resulting in rapid clearance of parasites even in severe P. falciparum malaria patients. During the last five years, artemisinin-resistant parasites have begun to emerge first in Cambodia and now in Thailand and Myanmar. At present, the level of artemisinin resistance is relatively low with clinical presentation of delayed artemisinin clearance (a longer time to reduce parasite load) and a small decrease in artemisinin sensitivity in cultured isolates. Nevertheless, multiple genetic loci associated with delayed parasite clearance have been reported, but they cannot account for a large portion of cases. Even the most well-studied kelch 13 propeller mutations cannot always predict the outcome of artemisinin treatment in vitro and in vivo. Here we propose that delayed clearance by artemisinin could be the result of convergent evolution, driven by multiple trajectories to overcome artemisinin-induced stress, but precluded to become full blown resistance by high fitness cost. Genetic association studies by several genome-wide approaches reveal linkage disequilibrium between multiple loci and delayed parasite clearance. Genetic manipulations at some of these loci already have resulted in loss in artemisinin sensitivity. The notion presented here is by itself consistent with existing evidence on artemisinin resistance and has the potential to be explored using available genomic data. Most important of all, molecular surveillance of artemisinin resistance based on multi-genic markers could be more informative than relying on any one particular molecular marker.
