Dissipation of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARG) during composting of cattle manure generated through fortification versus administration of antimicrobials in feed was compared. Manure was collected from cattle fed diets containing (kg(-1)) dry matter (DM): (1) 44 mg chlortetracycline (CTC), (2) a mixture of 44 mg each of chlortetracycline and sulfamethazine (CTCSMZ), (3) 11 mg tylosin (TYL) or (4) Control, no antimicrobials. Manures were composted for 30 d with a single mixing after 16 d to generate the second heating cycle. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to measure 16S rDNA and tetracycline (tet), erythromycin (erm) and sulfamethazine (sul) genes. Temperature peaks ranged from 48 to 68 degrees C across treatments in the first composting cycle, but except for the control, did not exceed 55 degrees C in the second cycle. Copy numbers of 16S rDNA decreased (P < 0.05) during composting, but were not altered by antimcrobials. Except tet(L), all ARG decreased by 0.1-1.6 log10 g DM(-1) in the first cycle, but some genes (tet[B], tet[L], erm[F], erm[X]) increased (P < 0.05) by 1.0-3.1 log10 g DM(-1) in the second. During composting, levels of tet(M) and tet(W) in CTC, erm(A), erm(B) and erm(X) in TYL, and sul(1) in CTCSMZ remained higher (P < 0.05) in fed than fortified treatments. The dissipation of ARG during composting of manure fortified with antimicrobials differs from manure generated by cattle that are administered antimicrobials in feed, and does not always align with the dissipation of antimicrobial residues.
