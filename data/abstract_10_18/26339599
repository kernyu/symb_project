An increase in the antibiotic resistance among members of the Enterobacteriaceae family has been observed worldwide. Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative rods are increasingly reported. The treatment of infections caused by Escherichia coli and other Enterobacteriaceae has become an important clinical problem associated with reduced therapeutic possibilities. Antimicrobial carbapenems are considered the last line of defense against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Unfortunately, an increase of carbapenem resistance due to the production of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) enzymes has been observed. In this study we describe the ability of E. coli to produce carbapenemase enzymes based on the results of the combination disc assay with boronic acid performed according to guidelines established by the European Community on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) and the biochemical Carba NP test. Moreover, we evaluated the presence of genes responsible for the production of carbapenemases (bla KPC, bla VIM, bla IMP, bla OXA-48) and genes encoding other beta-lactamases (bla SHV, bla TEM, bla CTX-M) among E. coli isolate. The tested isolate of E. coli that possessed the bla KPC-3 and bla TEM-34 genes was identified. The tested strain exhibited susceptibility to colistin (0.38 mug/mL) and tigecycline (1 mug/mL). This is the first detection of bla KPC-3 in an E. coli ST479 in Poland.
