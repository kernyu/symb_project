INTRODUCTION: In venous ulcers, the presence of Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus resistance phenotypes can aggravate and limit the choices for treatment. METHODS: Staphylococcus isolated from 69 patients (98 ulcers) between October of 2009 and October of 2010 were tested. The macrolide, lincosamide, streptogramin B (MLS B) group resistance phenotype detection was performed using the D-test. Isolates resistant to cefoxitin and/or oxacillin (disk-diffusion) were subjected to the confirmatory test to detect minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), using oxacillin strips (E-test(R)). RESULTS: The prevalence of S. aureus was 83%, and 15% of coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CoNS). In addition were detected 28% of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and 47% of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcus (MRCoNS). Among the S. aureus, 69.6% were resistant to erythromycin, 69.6% to clindamycin, 69.6% to gentamicin, and 100% to ciprofloxacin. Considering the MRSA, 74% were highly resistant to oxacillin, MIC >/= 256microg/mL, and the MLS Bc constitutive resistance predominated in 65.2%. Among the 20 isolates sensitive to clindamycin, 12 presented an inducible MLS B phenotype. Of the MRCoNS, 71.4%were resistant to erythromycin, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. Considering the isolates positive for beta-lactamases, the MIC breakpoint was between 0.5 and 2microg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: The results point to a high occurrence of multi-drug resistant bacteria in venous ulcers in primary healthcare patients, thus evidencing the need for preventive measures to avoid outbreaks caused by multi-drug resistant pathogens, and the importance of healthcare professionals being able to identifying colonized versus infected venous ulcers as an essential criteria to implementing systemic antibacterial therapy.
