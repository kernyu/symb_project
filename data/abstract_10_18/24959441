OBJECTIVES: Acinetobacter spp. has emerged as a threat to the healthcare workers throughout the globe, owing to its property of multidrug resistance. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the antimicrobial resistance patterns of Acinetobacter spp. among indoor and out patients in our hospital and compare the resistance patterns in India and abroad. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, which was carried out between Over a period of one year, a total of 5593 clinical specimens of pus and purulent fluids were examined and antimicrobial resistance pattern for Acinetobacter spp. using Modified Stoke's were evaluated. Also a comparison was done with the other similar studies. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Using the proportions of sensitive and resistant, the statistical analysis was done. The total, mean and percentage were calculated by using SPSS. RESULTS: A high level of antimicrobial multidrug-resistance was found in almost all the clinical isolate. Our study was also found to be concordant with the results of other studies. CONCLUSION: There is an emerging need for identification of the genes and mechanisms for multidrug resistance among Acinetobacter spp.
