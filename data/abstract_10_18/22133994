Hormonal dependence of breast cancer has been known for a long time, yet about half of breast cancers with estrogen receptor will not respond to antihormonal therapy. Now, we know that this resistance may be related to a dysfunction of the estrogen pathway, or that of growth factors and particularly the pathway of cell activation PI3K/Akt/mTOR. Prevention of these different mechanisms of resistance could involve combination therapies such as anti-estrogens (SERMs, aromatase inhibitors) with inhibitors of the activity of growth factors that are particularly temsirolimus and everolimus for the activation pathway cell PI3K/Akt/mTOR.
