Oxymatrine (OMTR) is an anti-hepatitis drug used in China. Its mechanism of action is unknown. Recently, we found that OMTR inhibits hepatitis B virus (HBV) via down-regulating the expression of heat-stress cognate 70 (Hsc70), a host protein required for HBV DNA replication. Goal of this study was to assess the effect of OMTR on clinical HBV drug-resistance. OMTR monotherapy (oral, 12 months) reduced blood HBV DNA by 96% and HBeAg by 70% in the chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients resistant to lamivudine (n = 17), equal to its efficacy in the naive CHB cohort (n = 20). Liver biopsy study showed that OMTR treatment caused a decrease of Hcs70 mRNA in liver cells, parallel with a reduction of intracellular HBV DNA. Combination of lamivudine with OMTR (n = 15) (oral, 12 months) showed an enhanced anti-HBV effect as compared to lamivudine monotherapy (n = 25). The incidence of drug resistance against lamivudine in the combination group was significantly lower than that in the lamivudine group (1/15 vs 7/25; p<0.01). The results were further confirmed in vitro. Treatment of HBV(+) HepH2215 cells with sub-optimal dose of OMTR for 8 months suppressed HBV replication without inducing drug resistance, whereas lamivudine monotherapy caused drug-resistant mutation in 3 months. Combination of OMTR with lamivudine prevented HBV from developing drug resistance.
