OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe the challenge faced by the national reference laboratory to support the national HIV/AIDS response in Madagascar. METHODS: Collaboration between the National Reference Laboratory of Madagascar (NRLM) and foreign partners (a laboratory and an international organization) on the basis of a tripartite agreement. The aim was to offer virological analysis to 259 HIV-infected patients. RESULTS: An alarming proportion (13.9%) of drug resistance among HIV-infected patients was observed. CONCLUSION: The NRLM contributed to improving the fight against HIV in Madagascar and led to the revision of national therapeutic guidelines. Strengthening reference laboratories has to be a priority in developing countries.
