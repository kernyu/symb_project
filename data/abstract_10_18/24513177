COUP-TFII is reduced in endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells and is negatively associated with tumor grade. Transient re-expression of COUP-TFII restores antiestrogen sensitivity in resistant LCC2 and LCC9 cells and repression of COUP-TFII results in antiestrogen-resistance in MCF-7 endocrine-sensitive cells. We addressed the hypothesis that reduced COUP-TFII expression in endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells results from epigenetic modification. The NR2F2 gene encoding COUP-TFII includes seven CpG islands, including one in the 5' promoter and one in exon 1. Treatment of LCC2 and LCC9 endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (AZA), a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor, +/- trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, increased COUP-TFII suggesting that the decrease in COUP-TFII is mediated by epigenetic changes. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) revealed higher methylation of NR2F2 in the first exon in LCC2 and LCC9 cells compared to MCF-7 cells and AZA reduced this methylation. Translational importance is suggested by Cancer Methylome System (CMS) analysis revealing that breast tumors have increased COUP-TFII (NR2F2) promoter and gene methylation versus normal breast.
