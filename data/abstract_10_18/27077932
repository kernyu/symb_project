The aim of this study was to analyse the resistance and epidemiological data of 117 Acinetobacter baumannii isolates from Southwest Hospital, Chongqing, China. Except for polymyxin B, tigecycline, minocycline, cefoperazone/sulbactam, amikacin and levofloxacin, the resistance rates of other antimicrobial agents were above 90%. All the clinical isolates had the blaOXA-51 gene and 114 isolates had the blaOXA-23 gene. Forty-nine isolates were found to contain the blaIMP-4 gene. PFGE data showed that 117 isolates were divided into 25 groups. Sixty-three (53.85%) were found to carry the class 1 integron, and the sequence analysis of the class 1 integron internal variable regions - five types, one of which had the blaIMP-4 gene. For the blaIMP-4 positive strain without class 1 integron, we found the flanking sequence had the TnpA gene. The result suggested that the resistance gene was widely distributed in our hospital; moreover, the modes of presence and transmission are different and complicated. The results of our study can improve the infection empirical treatment method and infection control programme.
