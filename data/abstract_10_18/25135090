Gram-positive cocci are commonly isolated in orthopaedic implant infections and their resistance to beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones is increasing. The high oral bioavailability of linezolid makes it an attractive oral alternative to glycopeptides and its use has increased in the last decade. To evaluate experience with linezolid in orthopaedic implant infections a systematic review of the literature available in English was undertaken. Only those articles describing series of >/=10 patients with acute or chronic orthopaedic implant infections treated with linezolid and with a clear definition of diagnosis and outcome were selected. A total of 293 patients (79.9% had prosthetic joint infections) were analysed in the 10 articles included. The overall remission rate with at least 3 months of follow-up was 79.9%, depending on whether the implant was removed or not (94% versus 69.9%). The addition of rifampicin was described in only two articles and no significant difference was observed. Adverse events were frequent during prolonged administration of linezolid (34.3%), requiring treatment discontinuation in 12.8%. The most common event was anaemia (13.4%) followed by gastrointestinal symptoms (11.1%). In conclusion, linezolid seems a good oral treatment alternative for orthopaedic implant infections due to Gram-positive cocci resistant to beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones. However, close monitoring of adverse events is required.
