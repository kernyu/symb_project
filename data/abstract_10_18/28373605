In this study, we have investigated the effects of the newly synthesized analog of Pseudomonas aeruginosa quorum-sensing autoinducer named AIA-1 (autoinducer analog) against antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In vitro susceptibility and killing assays for P. aeruginosa PAO1DeltaoprD mutant and clinical isolates were performed by using antibiotics and AIA-1. In an in vivo assay, a luminescent carbapenem-resistant strain derived from PAO1DeltaoprD was injected into neutropenic ICR mice and bioluminescence images were acquired after the treatment with antibiotics and AIA-1. Additionally, we investigated the effects of the combination use against carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). Using killing assays in P. aeruginosa, the survival rates in the presence of antibiotics and AIA-1 significantly decreased in comparison with those with antibiotics alone. Furthermore, dual treatment of biapenem and AIA-1 was more effective than biapenem alone in a mouse infection model. AIA-1 did not change the MICs in P. aeruginosa, suggesting that AIA-1 acts on the mechanism of antibiotic tolerance. Conversely, the MICs of antibiotics decreased in the presence of AIA-1 in some CRE strains, indicating that AIA-1 may require additional mechanism to act on CRE. In conclusion, AIA-1 may be a potent drug for clinical treatment of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. J. Med. Invest. 64: 101-109, February, 2017.
