OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of Zhusha Anshen pill, cinnabar, HgS, HgCl2 and MeHg on the gene expression of renal transporters in mice. METHOD: Healthy male mice were given equivalent physiological saline, Zhusha Anshen pill (1.8 g . kg(-1), containing 0.17 g . kg(-1) of mercury), cinnabar (0.2 g . kg(-1), containing 1.7 g . kg(-1) of mercury), high dose cinnabar (2 g . kg(-1), containing 1.7 g . kg(-1) of mercury), HgS (0.2 g . kg(-1), containing 0.17 g . kg(-1) of mercury), HgCl2 (0.032 g . kg(-1), containing 0. 024 g . kg(-1) of mercury), MeHg (0.026 g . kg(-1), containing 0.024 g . kg(-1) of mercury), once daily, for 30 d, measuring body mass gain. 30 days later, the mice were sacrificed. The mercury accumulation in kidneys was detected with atomic fluorescence spectrometer. Expressions of Oat1, Oat2, Oat3, Mrp2, Mrp4, Urat1 were detected with RT-PCR. RESULT: Compared with the normal control group, a significant accumulation of Hg in kidney in HgCl2 and MeHg groups was observed (P <0.05), but these changes were not found in other groups. Compared with normal control group, mRNA expressions of Oat1 and Oat2 were evidently lower in HgCl2 and MeHg groups, but mRNA expressions of Mrp2 were apparently higher in HgCl2 group (P <0.05), mRNA expression of Mrp4 was significant higher in HgCl2 and MeHg groups, and mRNA expression of Urat1 was apparently lower in MeHg group. CONCLUSION: HgCl2 and MeHg groups show significant difference from the normal group in mercury accumulation in kidneys and gene expression of kidney transporters, but with no difference between other groups and the normal group. Compared with HgCl2 and MeHg, cinnabar and its compounds could cause lower renal toxicity to mice.
