Six new caffeic acid derivatives, Clerodens E-J (1-6) were isolated from the aerial part of Clerodendranthus spicatus. Their structures were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analysis, including NMR, MS, and ECD data. Compound 1 showed moderate antibacterial activities against drug-resistant strains of bacteria in vitro.
