Reptiles are increasingly kept as pets in the UK and the majority of animals presented for veterinary attention have conditions with a bacterial basis, either as a primary infection or secondary to husbandry deficiencies. Culture and sensitivity tests can provide useful information for selecting treatment protocols, but the lack of published data reviewing the normal reptilian microflora means interpretation of results is subjective. This study publishes the results of culture and sensitivity results from all reptilian samples provided to a commercial pathology laboratory over a 24-month period and compares these data with the published literature to assist clinicians to determine appropriate treatment protocols. Results provided a wide range of cultured organisms, although trends were seen for varying anatomical locations, species and time of year. In addition, antibiotic sensitivity revealed some concerning trends.
