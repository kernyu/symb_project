We report a retrospective monocentric descriptive study performed in CHI Creteil for 20 months to describe the management and outcome of amikacin monotherapy as an alternative to third-generation cephalosporins for empiric treatment of febrile urinary tract infection (FUTI) in children. Data were analyzed for 151 children, and 90 selected cases were classified as certain or highly probable FUTI. Escherichia coli infection was found in 89 cases. In all patients, fever was resolved within 72 hours after beginning amikacin treatment. Only 5.3% of children were febrile after 48 hours. The mean amikacin treatment duration was 3.05 +/- 0.13 days before oral treatment began (guided by antibiotic susceptibility testing). Amikacin monotherapy seems effective for the initial management of FUTI in children.
