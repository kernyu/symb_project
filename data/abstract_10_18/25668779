Cisplatin resistance is a challenge in the treatment of ovarian cancer. The aim of this study was to explore if ultrasound can overcome chemoresistance and enhance chemosensitization due to cyclosporin A. Ultrasound and/or cyclosporin A were employed to overcome cisplatin resistance in human ovarian cancer cell line COC1/DDP. Mechanisms were explored from the perspective of: DNA damage, intracellular platinum level, detoxification, and genes related to drug efflux and DNA repair. In vivo therapeutic efficacy was validated in a short-term model (subrenal cell-clot transplantation) in mice and the survival benefit was investigated in an orthotopic cancer model in mice using HO-8910PM cells. The findings were: (i) ultrasound enhanced the effect of cisplatin leading to a lower cell-survival rate (IC50 decreased from 3.19 to 0.35 mug/ml); (ii) ultrasound enhanced cisplatin via direct (increasing the intercellular level of active platinum) and indirect (decreasing the glutathione level, and expression of LRP and ERCC1 genes) mechanisms that intensified cisplatin-induced DNA damage, thus enhancing cell apoptosis and necrosis; (iii) cisplatin followed by ultrasound led to small tumor sizes in the short-term model without exacerbation of the systemic toxicity, and prolonged the survival times in the orthotopic model; and (iv) ultrasound synergized the sensitization due to cyclosporin A in vitro and in vivo. These data demonstrated that ultrasound combined with cyclosporin A overcame cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer.
