The emergence of M. tuberculosis strains resistant to at least, Isoniazid (INH) and Rifampicin (RIF), the two most potent drugs of first-line anti-TB therapy is termed multidrug drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). This is a cause of concern to TB Control Programmes worldwide. When MDR-TB strains become resistant to the major second-line drugs, one of the fluouroquinolones and one of the three injectable drugs (Amikacin, Kanamycin and Capreomycin), it is defined as extensively drug resistant TB.(1,2) MDR-TB is a manmade, costly and deadly problem. Rapid diagnosis of MDR-TB is essential for the prompt initiation of effective second-line therapy to improve treatment outcome and limit transmission of the disease.
