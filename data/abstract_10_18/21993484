The aim of this study was to establish the antimicrobial activities of S-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)isothiourea hydrochloride (A22) and a series of structurally related compounds against multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 21 compounds were determined against 18 strains of pathogenic bacteria in addition to Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=19) and Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) (n=20) isolated from the sputa of cystic fibrosis patients. Selected compounds were tested against further isolates, including P. aeruginosa (n=100), BCC (n=12) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n=19). The interaction of S-(4-chlorobenzyl)isothiourea hydrochloride (C2) in combination with conventional antimicrobials was examined against 10 P. aeruginosa strains. Selected compounds were also tested against Enterobacteriaceae producing NDM-1 carbapenemase (n=64) and meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (n=37). Of the 21 compounds, 14 showed antimicrobial activity that was generally more pronounced against Gram-negative bacteria. Against P. aeruginosa, the most active compound was C2 [MIC for 50% of the organisms (MIC(50))=32mug/mL]. This compound was also the most active against BCC, with all isolates inhibited by 64mug/mL. For all ten strains of P. aeruginosa subjected to combination testing with C2 and conventional antimicrobials, a bactericidal effect was achieved with at least one combination. C2 and A22 both showed strong activity [MIC for 90% of the organisms (MIC(90))=4mug/mL] against Enterobacteriaceae that produced NDM-1 carbapenemase. Finally, S-(4-chlorobenzyl)-N-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)isothiourea hydrochloride showed good activity (MIC(90)=8mug/mL) against MRSA. This work establishes the activity of isothiourea derivatives against a broad range of clinically important MDR bacteria.
