Amplification of pfmdr1 in Plasmodium falciparum is linked to resistance to aryl-amino-alcohols and in reduced susceptibility to artemisinins. We demonstrate here that duplicated pfmdr1 genotypes circulate in West Africa. The monitoring of this prevalence in Africa appears essential for determining the antimalarial policy and to maintain the efficiency of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for as long as possible.
