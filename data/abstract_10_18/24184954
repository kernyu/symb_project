Urinary tract infections (UTI) are one of the common chronic and recurrent bacterial infections. Uropathogens which are able to form biofilm constitute a major etiological factor in UTI, especially among elder patients who are subject to long-term catheterization. It is caused by the capacity of the microorganisms for efficient and permanent colonization of tissues and also adhesion to diverse polymers used for urological catheter production such as propylene, polystyrene, silicone, polyvinyl chloride or silicone coated latex. Antibiotic therapy is the most common treatment for UTI. Fluoroquinolones, nitrofurans, beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, trimethoprim and sulfonamides are used predominantly. However, the biofilm due to its complex structure constitutes an effective barrier to the antibiotics used in the treatment of urinary tract infections. In addition, the growing number of multidrug resistant strains limits the usage of many of the currently available chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore, it seems important to search for new methods of treatment such as coating of catheters with non-pathogenic E. coli strains, the design of vaccines against fimbrial adhesive proteins of the bacterial cells or the use of bacteriophages.
