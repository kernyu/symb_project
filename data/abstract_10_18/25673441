BACKGROUND: Decreases in the bioavailability of rifampicin (RFP) can lead to the development of drug resistance and treatment failure. Therefore, we investigated the relative bioavailability of RFP from one four-drug fixed-dose combination (FDC; formulation A) and three two-drug FDCs (formulations B, C, and D) used in China, compared with RFP in free combinations of these drugs (reference), in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Eighteen and twenty healthy Chinese male volunteers participated in two open-label, randomized two-period crossover (formulations A and C) or one three-period crossover (formulations B and D) study, respectively. The washout period between treatments was 7 days. Bioequivalence was assessed based on 90% confidence intervals, according to two one-sided t-tests. All analyses were done with DAS 3.1.5 (Mathematical Pharmacology Professional Committee of China, Shanghai, China). RESULTS: Mean pharmacokinetic parameter values of RFP obtained for formulations A, B, C, and D products were 11.42 +/- 3.41 mug/ml, 7.86 +/- 5.78 mug/ml, 13.05 +/- 6.80 mug/ml, and 16.18 +/- 3.87 mug/ml, respectively, for peak plasma concentration (C max ), 91.43 +/- 30.82 mug.h-1.ml-1 , 55.49 +/- 37.58 mug.h-1.ml-1 , 96.50 +/- 47.24 mug.h-1.ml-1 , 101.47 +/- 33.07 mug.h-1.ml-1 , respectively, for area under the concentration-time curve (AUC 0-24 h ). CONCLUSIONS: Although the concentrations of RFP for formulations A, C, and D were within the reported acceptable therapeutic range, only formulation A was bioequivalent to the reference product. The three two-drug FDCs (formulations B, C and D) displayed inferior RFP bioavailability compared with the reference (Chinese Clinical Trials registration number: ChiCTR-TTRCC-12002451).
