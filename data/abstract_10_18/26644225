Increased antibacterial resistance (ABR) and limited drug discovery warrant optimized use of available antibiotics. One option is to rationally combine two antibiotics (fixed dose combination (FDC)) that may delay or prevent emergence of ABR in notorious pathogen. Major concern with FDC is the mutual interaction of its components that might influence their pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, requiring reassessing of whole formulation (adding cost and time). The interaction can be identified by comparing PK profile of a drug present in FDC with its independent entity. An open-label, crossover, single-dose comparative PK study of FDC (ceftriaxone and sulbactam) with their individual reference formulations was performed in 24 healthy adult subjects. No mutual PK interactions between ceftriaxone and sulbactam were observed. Pharmacokinetic data was used to develop a population-PK model to understand between-subject variability (BSV). Pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone/sulbactam was explained by one and two compartment models, respectively. The subject's "weight" was identified as a covariate explaining BSV. Both internal and external validations (healthy/infected subjects) were done. The model-derived population-PK parameters of FDC's active components in infected subjects were similar to literature reported values of individual components. Efficacies of various FDC dosage regimens over a range of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were assessed by Monte Carlo simulations using population-PK parameters of infected/healthy subjects. In infected subjects, 3 g FDC/24 h can treat bacteria with MIC </=8 mug/mL, while for MIC 8-32 mug/mL, 3 g FDC/12 h is recommended. Lastly, the developed population-PK model was successfully used to predict drug exposure in pediatric population.
