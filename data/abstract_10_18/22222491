BACKGROUND: Emergence of antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens often leads to the failure of existing antibiotics to treat bacterial infections; thus, there is a need to seek alternative treatment measures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-quorum sensing (anti-QS) and antibiofilm potential of Capparis spinosa to prevent the onset of bacterial infections as an alternate to antibiotics. METHODS: The methanolic extract of the dried fruits of C. spinosa was assessed for its activity in inhibiting QS-depedent phenomenon such as violacein pigment production in Chromobacterium violaceum, biosurfactant production in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, swimming and swarming motility, exopolysaccharide production (EPS) and biofilm formation in Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens and PAO1. RESULTS: Extract of C. spinosa showed a higher degree of anti-QS activity in a dose dependent manner without affecting the bacterial growth. At 2 mg/mL, this extract significantly (p </=0.005) inhibited the biofilm formation to 79, 75, 73, 70% and EPS production to 58, 46, 66 and 67% in S. marcescens, PAO1, E. coli and P. mirabilis, respectively. It also exhibited inhibition in swimming and swarming motility of bacterial pathogens. The non-enzymatic nature of the anti-QS compound in C. spinosa was confirmed by proteinase K and heat treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Because the methanolic extract of C. spinosa demonstrated anti-QS and antibiofilm activity at 0.5-2 mg/mL, it could be further exploited for novel molecules to treat the emerging infections of antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens.
