Abstract Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:- has become the third most common serotype in Europe, including the Czech Republic. In this study, phenotypic and genotypic methods for a more detailed description of this serotype were used. Analysis of a limited number of isolates revealed that 76% of them belonged to phage type DT193. Also, rare phage types DT208 and U311 were identified. In total, 88.6% of the isolates were resistant to at least four antimicrobial agents. In this study, 24 multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis profiles were detected, and some of them matched with the profiles recently described in Europe.
