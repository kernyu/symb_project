The distinction between healthcare-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) and community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) infections has become increasingly blurred. We assessed the molecular characterization and antimicrobial resistance profile for MRSA isolates from blood. Most of all (81.9%) isolates are related to known HA-MRSA and CA-MRSA epidemic lineages, such as, USA300, USA400, USA600, USA800 and USA1100. This is the first multicenter study in Rio de Janeiro.
