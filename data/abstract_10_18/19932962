The development of new antibacterial therapeutic agents capable of halting microbial resistance is a chief pursuit in clinical medicine. Laterocidin and its analogues were synthesized for the first time by solid-phase synthesis method via linking of the carboxyl group on side chain of Aspartate to Rink resin with the protection of side chain alpha-carboxyl group of Aspartate by Dmab as a temporary alpha-COOH protecting group for the on-resin cyclization. Different configuration of N- and C-terminal was benefit to peptide cyclization. Laterocidin analogue 3 (Asp(1)-->Asn(1), Phe(4)-->Tyr(4) and d-Tyr(6)-->d-Phe(6)) demonstrated potent and broad antimicrobial properties, especially exhibited activity against clinical Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (L-MRSA) and the gram-negative extended-spectrum beta-lactamases-producing Escherichia coli (ESBLs E. coli) and L-E.coli. This finding has important significance to exploit new antibiotic medicine.
