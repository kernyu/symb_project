Acinetobacter baumannii is the most common species to have developed resistance to antibiotics. Due to increasing levels of drug resistance, the available therapeutic options are insufficient in A. baumannii infections. This study investigated the efficacy of doripenem monotherapy versus doripenem combination therapy with sulbactam, amikacin, colistin and tigecycline in experimental sepsis. A carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii was used to develop a sepsis model in 8-10-week-old Balb/c mice by intraperitoneal injection. Antibiotic therapies were initiated two hours after injection of bacterial suspension. Necropsy was performed at 24, 48 and 72 hours and cultures were made from heart, lung, liver and spleen samples. Bacterial loads of lung and liver were calculated as CFU/g. Combination therapies with doripenem were more effective than monotherapy at 24 and 48 hours of infection but no differences between groups were detected at 72 hours. The combination of doripenem with tigecycline and amikacin began to eradicate the bacterial load of lung and liver after 48 hours of infection, whereas doripenem+sulbactam and doripenem+colistin were started to eradication at 72 hours. The results of the study showed that combination therapies with doripenem are more effective than monotherapy and the combination of doripenem with tigeycline or amikacin has more rapid bactericidal effect than that with sulbactam or colistin.
