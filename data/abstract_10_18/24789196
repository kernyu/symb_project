Health care-associated pneumonia due to multidrug-resistant organisms represents a major therapeutic challenge. Unfortunately, treatment is dependent on empirical therapy, which often leads to improper and inadequate antimicrobial therapy. A rapid multiplex PCR-based Unyvero pneumonia application (UPA) assay that assists in timely decision-making has recently become available. In this study, we evaluated the performance of UPA in detecting etiological pathogens and resistance markers in patients with nosocomial pneumonia (NP). The impact of this assay on the management of severe nosocomial pneumonia was also assessed. Appropriate specimens were processed by UPA according to the manufacturer's protocol in parallel with conventional culture methods. Of the 56 patients recruited into the study, 49 (87.5%) were evaluable. Of these, 27 (55.1%) and 4 (8.2%) harbored multiple bacteria by the PCR assay and conventional culture, respectively. A single pathogen was detected in 8 (16.3%) and 4 (8.2%) patients, respectively. Thirteen different genes were detected from 38 patients, including the ermB gene (40.8%), the blaOXA-51-like gene (28.6%), the sul1 (28.6%) and int1 (20.4%) integrase genes, and the mecA and blaCTX-M genes (12.3% each). The time from sample testing to results was 4 h versus 48 to 96 h by UPA and culture, respectively. Initial empirical treatment was changed within 5 to 6 h in 33 (67.3%) patients based on the availability of UPA results. Thirty (62.2%) of the patients improved clinically. A total of 3 (6.1%) patients died, mainly from their comorbidities. These data demonstrate the potential of a multiplex PCR-based assay for accurate and timely detection of etiological agents of NP, multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms, and resistance markers, which can guide clinicians in making early antibiotic adjustments.
