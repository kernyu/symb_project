BACKGROUND: Mycoplasma pneumonia (M. pneumoniae) is one of the key pathogens of community-acquired pneumonia. A global pandemic of M. pneumoniae has occurred since 2010. The aim of this study was to survey the prevalence of M. pneumoniae in children in Beijing from 2007-2012. METHODS: A total of 3 073 clinical specimens were obtained from pediatric patients with respiratory tract infections from January 2007 to December 2012, and examined by nested polymerase chain reaction. PCR products were visualized by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis, positive products sequenced, and compared with reference sequences in GenBank. Macrolide resistance-associated mutations were also detected for some positive samples. RESULTS: Of the 3 073 specimens, 588 (19.13%) were positive for M. pneumoniae, 12.4% of which were accompanied by viral infections. Positive rates for M. pneumoniae were highest in 2007 and 2012, showing a significant difference when compared with other years. Infections tended to occur in autumn and winter and positive rates were significantly higher for children aged 3-16. The rate of macrolide resistance-associated mutations was 90.7%, and the predominant mutation was an A-->G transition (89.92%) at position 2063 in domain V of the 23S rRNA gene. CONCLUSIONS: M. pneumoniae outbreaks occurred in 2007 and 2012 in pediatric patients in Beijing, which is consistent with the global prevalence of M. pneumoniae. M. pneumoniae can cause multi-system infections in children, and may be accompanied with viral infections. We determined that school-age children are more susceptible to this disease, particularly in autumn and winter. Gene mutations associated with macrolide resistance were very common in M. pneumoniae-positive specimens during this period in Beijing.
