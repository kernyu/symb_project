PURPOSE: P66Shc, an isoform of adaptor proteins, is known to mediate various signals including those leading to apoptosis or cell proliferation. Previously, we have shown that diallyl trisulfide (DATS)-induced prostate cancer cell death was mediated by increased ROS formation. In this study, we investigated the role of p66Shc protein and its serine 36 phosphorylation in DATS induced decrease in prostate cancer cell viability (PC-3). METHODS: PC-3 prostate cancer cells were used in this study. Stable cell lines expressing p66ShcS36A or an empty vector have been obtained. Cell viability, concentration of ROS, changes in P-p66Shc and P-Akt and DNA damage were determined. RESULTS: We observed that DATS treatment increased p66Shc phosphorylation at serine 36. Importantly, the phosphorylation was abolished by JNK inhibitor SP600125. Cells expressing plasmid-encoded variant of p66ShcS36A showed much higher resistance to DATS-induced cells death. In addition to that, we observed that DATS-induced ROS formation was completely abolished in cells expressing the p66ShcS36A variant. Interestingly, SP600125 proved to prevent DATS-induced Akt inactivation. In order to confirm that the observed effect is related to phosphorylation of p66Shc, we performed experiments on a stable cell line expressing p66ShcS36A. In such cells, DATS-induced Akt dephosphorylation was significantly reduced. On the other hand, hydrogen peroxide induced Akt activation in PC-3 cells, which was abrogated in cells expressing p66ShcS36A. CONCLUSIONS: Our results uncover a novel signaling pathway with p66Shc being indispensable for DATS-induced inactivation of Akt due to hypophosphorylation.
