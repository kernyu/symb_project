During treatment, mutations in HIV-1 protease (PR) are selected rapidly that confer resistance by decreasing affinity to clinical protease inhibitors (PIs). As these unique drug resistance mutations can compromise the fitness of the virus to replicate, mutations that restore conformational stability and activity while retaining drug resistance are selected on further evolution. Here we identify several compensating mechanisms by which an extreme drug-resistant mutant bearing 20 mutations (PR20) with >5-fold increased Kd and >4000-fold decreased affinity to the PI darunavir functions. (1) PR20 cleaves, albeit poorly, Gag polyprotein substrates essential for viral maturation. (2) PR20 dimer, which exhibits distinctly enhanced thermal stability, has highly attenuated autoproteolysis, thus likely prolonging its lifetime in vivo. (3) The enhanced stability of PR20 results from stabilization of the monomer fold. Both monomeric PR20(T26A) and dimeric PR20 exhibit Tm values 6-7.5 degrees C higher than those for their PR counterparts. Two specific mutations in PR20, L33F and L63P at sites of autoproteolysis, increase the Tm of monomeric PR(T26A) by ~8 degrees C, similar to PR20(T26A). However, without other compensatory mutations as seen in PR20, L33F and L63P substitutions, together, neither restrict autoproteolysis nor significantly reduce binding affinity to darunavir. To determine whether dimer stability contributes to binding affinity for inhibitors, we examined single-chain dimers of PR and PR(D25N) in which the corresponding identical monomer units were covalently linked by GGSSG sequence. Linking of the subunits did not appreciably change the DeltaTm on inhibitor binding; thus stabilization by tethering appears to have little direct effect on enhancing inhibitor affinity.
