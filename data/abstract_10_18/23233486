OBJECTIVES: The enhanced intracellular survival (Eis) protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Eis_Mtb), a regio-versatile N-acetyltransferase active towards many aminoglycosides (AGs), confers resistance to kanamycin A in some cases of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB). We assessed the activity of Eis_Mtb and of its homologue from Mycobacterium smegmatis (Eis_Msm) against a panel of anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs and lysine-containing compounds. METHODS AND RESULTS: Both enzymes acetylated capreomycin and some lysine-containing compounds, but not other non-AG non-lysine-containing drugs tested. Modelling studies predicted the site of modification on capreomycin to be one of the two primary amines in its beta-lysine side chain. Using Eis_Mtb, we established via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy that acetylation of capreomycin occurs on the epsilon-amine of the beta-lysine side chain. Using Msm, we also demonstrated for the first time to our knowledge that acetylation of capreomycin results in deactivation of the drug. CONCLUSIONS: Eis is a unique acetyltransferase capable of inactivating the anti-TB drug capreomycin, AGs and other lysine-containing compounds.
