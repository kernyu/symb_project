Erythropoietin (EPO) contributes to insulin resistance in fat and muscle. In the present study, the role and mechanism of EPO in hepatic insulin resistance were investigated in HepG2 cells. Hepatic insulin resistance was induced by palmitic acid (PA) in the HepG2 cells, which were then treated with EPO (5 or 10 U/ml) or specific phosphoinositide 3kinase (PI3K) inhibitors, wortmannin or LY294002. EPO treatment significantly increased glycogen levels and reduced the protein expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase in the PAinduced HepG2 cells. EPO also inhibited the serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)1 (Ser307) and IRS2 (Ser473), and increased the protein expression levels of PI3K, phosphorylated (p)protein kinase B (AKT), pforkhead box O1 (FOXO1) and pglycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) beta. In agreement with these result, the expression of pFOXO1 (Ser256) and pGSK3beta (Ser9), downstream molecules of AKT, were enhanced by EPO treatment (P<0.05). The specific PI3K inhibitors, LY294002 and wortmannin, markedly inhibited the EPOmediated increases in pAKT (Ser473), pFOXO1 (Ser256) and pGSK3beta (Ser9) in the PAinduced HepG2 cells (P<0.05). The gene expression levels of tumor necrosis factoralpha, interleukin1beta and monocyte chemoattractant protein1, and the pcJun Nterminal kinase (JNK)/totalJNK ratio were markedly suppressed by EPO treatment. These findings suggested that EPO treatment improved hepatic glucose metabolism, potentially through the IRS/AKT/FOXO1 and GSK3beta signaling pathway, which may be associated with its inhibitory effect on the inflammation-associated response.
