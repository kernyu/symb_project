We surveyed 497 isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus collected from 2008 to 2009 as part of the ARTEMIS global surveillance study for elevated MIC values to itraconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole. Sequencing of the cyp51A gene revealed that 8/29 isolates with elevated MIC values to one or more triazoles, all originating in China, contained the TR/L98H mutation associated with resistant European isolates of A. fumigatus. This is the first time the TR/L98H mutation has been identified outside Europe.
