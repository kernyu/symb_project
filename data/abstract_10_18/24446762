INTRODUCTION: Dolutegravir is the first second-generation integrase inhibitor approved for the treatment of naive as well as experienced HIV-infected individuals. AREAS COVERED: Data from pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety, tolerability and resistance are reviewed from in vitro studies, Phase II and III clinical trials published in PubMed (Dolutegravir; S/GSK1349572) or presented in international meetings. EXPERT OPINION: Data from studies and clinical trials indicate that dolutegravir is safe, well tolerated and highly efficacious in the treatment of both antiretroviral-naive and treatment-experienced patients and appears to have a higher genetic barrier to resistance than first-generation integrase inhibitors.
