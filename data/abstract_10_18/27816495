The significant strides made in reducing global malaria burden over the past decades are being threatened by the emergence of multi-drug resistant malaria. Mechanisms of resistance to several classes of antimalarial drugs have been linked to key mutations in the Plasmodium falciparum genes. Pyrimethamine targets the dihydrofolate reductase of the bifunctional dihydrofolate reductase thymidylate synthase (DHFR-TS), and specific point mutations in the dhfr-ts gene have been assigned to resistant phenotypes. Several molecular methods are available to detect the mutant genotypes including DNA sequencing and PCR-based methods. In this study, we report the development of PfSNP-LAMP to detect nucleotide polymorphism in the dhfr gene associated with N51I mutation and antifolate resistance. The PfSNP-LAMP method was validated with genomic DNA samples and parasite lysates prepared from sensitive and pyrimethamine resistant strains of P. falciparum.
