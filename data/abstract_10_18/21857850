BACKGROUND: The relatively little resistance to quinine globally has led to an increase in its use in P. falciparum malaria especially in multi-drug resistant strains. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the physicochemical and equivalency of three brands of quinine sulphate tablets available in South Western region of Nigeria. METHODS: The pharmaceutical and chemical equivalence of three brands of quinine sulphate tablets were assessed through the evaluation of some biopharmaceutical parameters and active drug content. RESULTS: All the brands complied with the official specification for uniformity of weight. Two of the brands (A & B) gave similar crushing strengths while the third brand (C) gave a much lower value. Similarly all the brands complied with the official specification of disintegration test but the obtained values were statistically different (p<0.05). The T(70) obtained from the dissolution rate profile was less than 45 minutes for the three brands, although A and B were not statistically different but C was statistically from A and B. The quinine content of brands B and C are within the official specification however brand A with percentage content of 110+/-1.3%w/w, is above the specification while it is statistically different from the other brands. CONCLUSION: Brands B and C could be regarded as chemical equivalent, but they are not biopharmaceutical equivalents, on the other hand, brands A and B may be regarded as biopharmaceutical equivalents but not chemical equivalent.
