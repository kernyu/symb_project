We present here the draft genome of Bacillus toyonensis VU-DES13, which was isolated from the midgut of the soil-living springtail Folsomia candida Previous research revealed the presence of gene clusters for the biosynthesis of various secondary metabolites, including beta-lactam antibiotics, in the host's genome. The genome data are discussed in the light of the antimicrobial properties against fungi and oomycetes and a high level of beta-lactam resistance of the isolate.
