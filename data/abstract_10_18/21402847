This study determined the antimicrobial susceptibilities of 186 clinical isolates of Nocardia spp. isolated in Gipuzkoa, northern Spain, between 1998 and 2009. Most isolates were recovered from respiratory samples, Nocardia nova, N. farcinica, N. cyriacigeorgica, N. abscessus, and N. carnea being the species most frequently isolated. Linezolid and amikacin were the only two antimicrobials to which all isolates were susceptible. The majority of N. flavorosea, N. carnea, and N. farcinica isolates were trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistant.
