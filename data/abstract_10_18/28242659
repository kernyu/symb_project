Candida guilliermondii shows intrinsic reduced echinocandin susceptibility. It harbors two polymorphisms (L633M and T634A) in the Fks1p hot spot 1 region. Our objective was to confirm that the reduced echinocandin susceptibility of C. guilliermondii is due to those naturally occurring substitutions. We constructed a Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant in which a region of the FKS1 gene (including hot spot 1) was replaced with that from C. guilliermondii The chimeric mutants showed 32-fold increases in echinocandin MIC values, confirming the hypothesis.
