Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) nanosheets are emerging as promising 2D materials for different types of applications. However, biodegradation of hBN materials is poorly explored owing to their high chemical inertness and strong oxidation resistance. The assessment of oxidation/biodegradation of hBN is important in developing biomedical tools. Herein, we report the first study on the biodegradability of hBN nanosheets comparing the enzymatic catalysis of two different peroxidases, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and human myeloperoxidase (MPO), with the photo-Fenton (P.F.) reaction. The results show that degradation of hBN nanosheets is different to that of graphene and graphene oxide, since partial oxidation was found using MPO after 35 h, while HRP failed to degrade hBN up to 60 days. Nearly complete oxidation/degradation was occurred by P.F. reaction in 100 h. These results are helpful in designing advanced conjugates for biomedical uses of hBN.
