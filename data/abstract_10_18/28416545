We detected the colistin resistance gene mcr-1 in four Salmonella serovars isolated from humans and animals with diarrhea. The resistance gene was carried on different plasmids. One mcr-1-carrying conjugative plasmid, a variant of pHNSHP45, was disseminated among Salmonella isolates recovered from humans, pigs, and chickens.
