We studied the presence of primary resistance to raltegravir (RAL), natural polymorphisms, and selection pressure on HIV-1 integrase. We found a high frequency of integrase polymorphisms related to the resistance to RAL and sequence stability. Further studies are needed to determine the importance of these polymorphisms to RAL resistance.
