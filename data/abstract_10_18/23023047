In the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the major determinant of chloroquine resistance, P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt), likely plays an essential role in asexual blood stages, thus precluding conventional gene targeting approaches. We attempted to conditionally silence the expression of its ortholog in Plasmodium berghei (pbcrt) through Flp recombinase-mediated excision of the 3'untranslated region (UTR) during mosquito passage. However, parasites maintained pbcrt expression despite 3'UTR excision. Characterisation of these pbcrt mRNAs, by 3'rapid amplification of cDNA ends, identified several replacement 3'UTR sequences. Our observations demonstrate the astounding genetic plasticity of this parasite when faced with the loss of an essential gene.
