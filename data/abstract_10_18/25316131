Urinary Tract infections ( UTIs) are among the most common infections in infants and neonates. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the frequency of bacteria causing UTI and their relevant drug resistance patterns among infants and neonates hospitalized in Ilam province, Western Iran during 2007-2009. A total of 220 cases of UTI were enrolled in this cross-sectional retrospective study. A standard checklist was used for demographic and clinical data to be collected from their health records. Data was then analyzed using SPSS version 16.0. More than two-thirds (64.8%) of the cases were female. E. coli (44.5%), Klebsiella spp., (18.6%), Enterobacter spp., (15%) and Staphylococcus spp. (12.7%) were the most common microorganisms isolated from UTIs, respectively. High rates of resistance to tetracycline, ampicillin, and nalidixic acid were observed among these isolates. Similar to other studies, E. coli was the most common bacteria causing UTI and showed a high rate of resistance against most of the antimicrobial agents. Determining the antimicrobial sensitivity can be helpful for physicians in choosing an appropriate treatment for patients suffering from UTI, and also to reduce the complications related to serious UTI.
