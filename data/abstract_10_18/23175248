OXA-48 has emerged as a major carbapenemase associated with the Enterobacteriaceae in Europe, North Africa, and Asia. We report the first two clinical cases of OXA-48-type carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in the United States from patients recently hospitalized in Saudi Arabia and India. Each is more carbapenem resistant than nearly all previously reported OXA-48-type-producing Enterobacteriaceae.
