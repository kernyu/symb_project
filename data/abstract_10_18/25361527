Our group recently demonstrated that diverse fitness cost associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones allowed the extensive dissemination of the major international clones of both methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multiresistant Klebsiella pneumoniae in the healthcare setting. The mechanism described by us was subsequently confirmed by British authors investigating the dynamics of MRSA clones in England. Our results imply that the use of fluoroquinolones should impact the incidence for both MRSA and multiresistant K. pneumoniae. A review of the related clinical studies mostly support this notion and shows that changes in the consumption of fluoroquinolone type antibiotics and the rates for both MRSA and multiresistant ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae remain usually in accordance. Though the association seems strong and the mechanism behind it unequivocal the use of fluoroquinolones should not be abandoned; a more judicious application can be recommended.
