Both medical and surgical approaches have been shown to be effective in the treatment of patients with diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO). In patients with risk factors of bad outcome such as major bone destruction, concomitant acute infections requiring drainage, problems in limb perfusion, highly resistant bacteria, and contraindication for or patient refusal of prolonged antibiotic therapy, the choice of surgery does not require further discussion. On the contrary, modest changes of bone on imaging assessment and no limiting factors as described above make medical treatment an attractive option for patients with DFO provided the rules of antibiotic treatment of chronic osteomyelitis are respected. The key question may not be to oppose surgery and medical treatment but to identify patients who need surgery and those who do not. There is currently no classification or score system that may allow physician to decide whether medical or surgical approach is best adapted to a given patient, and so both experience and skill of the multidisciplinary team appear paramount for guiding the choice of the best adapted ("tailored") strategy in a given patient. In this regard, it would be interesting to compare surgical and medical approaches for DFO that apparently may benefit from one or another (ie, bone lesions seen on plain radiographs of the foot but without bone fragmentation or multiple sites of osteomyelitis, no contraindication to prolonged antibiotic therapy, and location of bone involvement that may allow conservative surgery). Given the current available data on the therapeutic options of DFO, it appears that surgery for those patients is obviously not an old-fashioned option.
