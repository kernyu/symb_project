BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax is the most widespread of the malaria parasites infecting human hosts. In malaria-eliminating settings, both imported and local malaria predominantly occurs in border areas, and most of them are P. vivax. Chloroquine (CQ) is the first-line drug for P. vivax treatment in China. To understand CQ sensitivity in P. vivax, in vivo monitoring of CQ resistance was conducted along the China-Myanmar border from 2008 to 2013. METHODS: Eligible patients with mono-infections of P. vivax were recruited to this study after obtaining full informed consent. CQ tablets for different categories of kg body weight ranges were given once a day for three days. Patients were followed up for 28 days. PCR was conducted to distinguish between re-infection and recrudescence, to confirm the Plasmodium species. The data were entered and analysed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Treatment outcome and sensitivity were classified according to the WHO recommended standards. RESULTS: 603 patients were completed valid follow-up. The fever clearance time and asexual parasite clearance times were, respectively, 22.2 +/- 10.2 and 38.1 +/- 12.6 hours. 594 (98.5%) patients were adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR), and nine (1.5%) patients, who were late clinical failure (LCF) or resistant response level I (RI), were imported from the neighbouring districts of Myanmar. CONCLUSION: In terms of efficacy, CQ is still effective for vivax malaria treatment. Plasmodium vivax CQ sensitivity had not significantly changed along the China-Myanmar border of Yunnan Province, China.
