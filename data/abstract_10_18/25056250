BACKGROUND: Inorganic antibacterial factors provide high bacterial resistance and thermal stability. Inorganic nanomaterial consists of modern formulation, biological, chemical, and physical properties produced on the basis of their function and influenced by their nano scales, the reason for which they have become very popular. The antibacterial effect of Cadmium Oxide Nanoparticles on Staphylococcus Aureus has been studied for the first time in this research because of their resistance to antibiotics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Different concentrations consist of 10 mug/ml, 15 mug/ml, and 20 mug/ml have been provided and their effects were studied in the agar and broth against the foregoing bacteria. Needless to say, the optimization of their non-microbial effect in variable times, pH, and temperatures of exposure was analyzed. RESULTS: The results represented that there is a direct association between the nanoparticles applied dosage and the restrain effect augmentation of applied dosage results in increase in restrain effect. In the study of environmental factors (pH and temperature), the results are in line with the inherent physiology of the bacteria; however, there was a significant decline in the number of analyzed bacteria cells due to the "Double Effect" of nanoparticle-pH variations as well as nanoparticle-temperature variables. In the very study, the promotion of Cadmium Oxide nanoparticles concentration leads to the elevation of antimicrobial feature and the reduction of bacteria growth rate is consistent with the other surveys about the nanoparticles effects on microorganisms to be more specific, one can come to this conclusion that the presence of nanoparticles prompts cellular destruction. CONCLUSION: In the recent study, by elevation in Cadmium Oxide nanoparticles concentration, the antimicrobial property augments and the bacteria growth rate declines, that are in line with other researches about the nanoparticles effect on microorganisms.
