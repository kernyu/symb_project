BACKGROUND: The IMPACT study was a randomized, double-blind study comparing 100 to 200 days of VGCV prophylaxis (900 mg once daily) in D+/R- kidney transplant recipients. Although extending the duration of prophylaxis resulted in a significant reduction in confirmed cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease (100-day: 36.8% vs 200-day: 16.1%(1)), the consequence of extending the duration of prophylaxis on the development of viral resistance remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether extending valganciclovir prophylaxis from 100 days to 200 days increased the incidence of ganciclovir resistance. STUDY DESIGN: Genotypic analysis of CMV UL97 and UL54 was conducted on virus isolated from patients meeting the predefined resistance analysis criteria (RAC). RESULTS: A greater number of patients met the RAC in the 100 day prophylaxis arm (50/163; 31%) compared to the 200 day prophylaxis arm (22/155; 14%). Sequence data were successfully generated for all 200-day patients and 48/50 100-day patients. Three patients in each treatment arm (100 day: 3/163 (1.8%) vs 200 day: 3/155 (1.9%)) had a single known valganciclovir resistance mutation detected (100 day: UL97 gene: M460V, C592G twice; 200 day: UL97 gene: C603W, M460V and UL54 gene: P522S). Overall, a resistance mutation was more likely to be detected if the patient met the RAC during prophylaxis (5/12 (42%)) compared to post-prophylaxis (1/58 (2%)). All six patients with known ganciclovir resistance mutations cleared the virus; three cleared virus without treatment and three cleared virus following treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Extending valganciclovir prophylaxis from 100 days to 200 days did not significantly affect the incidence of ganciclovir resistance.
