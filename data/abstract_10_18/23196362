Data on biliary carriage of bacteria and, specifically, of bacteria with worrisome and unexpected resistance traits (URB) are lacking. A prospective study (April 2010 to December 2011) was performed that included all patients admitted for <48 h for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a Spanish hospital. Bile samples were cultured and epidemiological/clinical data recorded. Logistic regression models (stepwise) were performed using bactobilia or bactobilia by URB as dependent variables. Models (P < 0.001) showing the highest R(2) values were considered. A total of 198 patients (40.4% males; age, 55.3 +/- 17.3 years) were included. Bactobilia was found in 44 of them (22.2%). The presence of bactobilia was associated (R(2) Cox, 0.30) with previous biliary endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) (odds ratio [OR], 8.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.96 to 27.06; P < 0.001), previous admission (OR, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.10 to 7.24; P = 0.031), and age (OR, 1.09 per year; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.12; P < 0.001). Ten out of the 44 (22.7%) patients with bactobilia carried URB: 1 Escherichia coli isolate (CTX-M), 1 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate (OXA-48), 3 high-level gentamicin-resistant enterococci, 1 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus isolate, 3 Enterobacter cloacae strains, and 1 imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain. Bactobilia by URB (versus those by non-URB) was only associated (R(2) Cox, 0.19) with previous ERCP (OR, 11.11; 95% CI, 1.98 to 62.47; P = 0.006). For analyses of patients with bactobilia by URB versus the remaining patients, previous ERCP (OR, 35.284; 95% CI, 5.320 to 234.016; P < 0.001), previous intake of antibiotics (OR, 7.200; 95% CI, 0.962 to 53.906; P = 0.050), and age (OR, 1.113 per year of age; 95% CI, 1.028 to 1.206; P = 0.009) were associated with bactobilia by URB (R(2) Cox, 0.19; P < 0.001). Previous antibiotic exposure (in addition to age and previous ERCP) was a risk driver for bactobilia by URB. This may have implications in prophylactic/therapeutic measures.
