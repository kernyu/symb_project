OBJECTIVES: Few dental conditions require treatment with antibiotics, yet dentists account for 7% of antimicrobial prescribing. In light of the emerging global problem of antibiotic resistance, this fact is problematic. Little is known about the antibiotic prescribing practices of dentists in Saudi Arabia. This study therefore aimed to investigate the attitudes of dentists in Saudi Arabia towards the prescription of antibiotics for pulpal and periapical pathology. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study involving an online questionnaire on antibiotic prescribing practices. A total of 195 dentists in three areas of southern Saudi Arabia (Najran, Gizan and Asser) completed the survey. RESULTS: No significant differences in prescribing habits were found among respondents according to age, sex, level of education or time in endodontic practice. The percentage of respondents who reported that they would prescribe antibiotics for five endodontic conditions not requiring antibiotic treatment ranged from 8.1% to 28.1%. Most respondents (81.9%) would correctly prescribe antibiotics for a necrotic pulp with acute apical periodontitis and swelling; this result was consistent with previous studies. Reported antibiotic usage among the surveyed dentists was quite high. CONCLUSIONS: Relatively high antibiotic use suggests a need to educate both dentists and patients about restricting the use of antibiotics to cases of severe infection and when indicated. More educational initiatives to rationalise the use of antibiotics in dental practice are needed to avoid further contributing to antibiotic resistance.
