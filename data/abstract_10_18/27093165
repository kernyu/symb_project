Ceftaroline is the first beta-lactam antibiotic with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). We describe a ceftaroline-resistant MRSA strain, isolated from a girl with cystic fibrosis after 22 ceftaroline treatment courses. MRSA genome sequencing documented a Tyr446Asn alteration in penicillin binding protein 2 that appeared responsible for resistance. Noncompartmental ceftaroline pharmacokinetic evaluation in our patient documented increased clearance and volume of distribution compared with adults.
