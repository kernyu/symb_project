Although many reports describe the biological behavior of most prosthetic biomaterials in the presence of infection, little is known about the resistance of the FloWatch device to internal or external contamination. We report here on our experience with the FloWatch device in three pediatric patients who contracted persistent sepsis. Good control of infection and complete remission of sepsis were ultimately achieved in all three patients by intensive treatment with antibiotics without removal of the device.
