The clpB gene in Acetobacter pasteurianus was cloned and characterized. Although the clpB gene was transcribed in response to a temperature shift and exposure to ethanol, the clpB disruption mutant was only affected by high temperature, suggesting that the ClpB protein is closely associated with heat resistance in A. pasteurianus.
