PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In the last decade, sporadic and lethal human disease caused by zoonotic avian influenza viruses, and the seasonal activity of human H1N1 2009 pandemic type have driven intense epidemiological and laboratory studies into the virus life cycle. This article highlights major developments from mid-2012 to early 2014. RECENT FINDINGS: Advances in molecular techniques and efficient rollout of diagnostic tests have enabled the rapid identification of clinical cases and detailed genetic sequencing of viral genomes. Studies have contributed widely to the understanding of how and when influenza viruses circulate, what determines their innate pathogenicity in particular hosts and whether host cofactors influence disease severity. Other imperatives include investigations into how influenza can be better prevented by vaccination, or treated with antiviral drugs. SUMMARY: Avian influenza viruses present a continuous threat to human populations. There is a need for sustained surveillance and downstream research to evaluate the potential for future pandemics.
