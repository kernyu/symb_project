The aim of this work was to provide a microfluidic-aided fabrication of nanoparticles based on chitosan/poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-acrylic acid)/cellulose laurate [CS/P(NIPAAm-co-AAc/CL] blend for transdermal multidrug delivery applications. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) results showed that the diameter sizes of samples were in the range from 200 to 300nm along with a narrow size distribution. Also, the CS-based nanoparticles containing tretinoin and clindamycin phosphate prepared using microfluidic technique exhibited a sustained control release of the drugs as well as minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations compared to the samples fabricated via bulk mixing method. The thermal stability of the drugs loaded nanoparticles revealed a reduction in degradation for those fabricated by using microfluidic technique at 45 degrees C for one month. Afterward, the in vivo assessments confirmed that by applying the microfluidically generated nanoparticles containing two drugs, a declined superficial reddening (erythema) and suitable transdermal permeation as well as residency were happened with respect to the those samples prepared via bulk mixing method and also the drugs solution alone. Finally, these CS-based nanoparticles showed sufficient potential used for transdermal multidrug delivery applications.
