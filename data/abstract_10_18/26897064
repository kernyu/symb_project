Aspergillosis remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised population. The spectrum of disease is broad, ranging from severe and rapidly fatal infection to noninvasive disease. The diversity of patients and risk factors complicates diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making. Invasive procedures are often precluded by host status; noninvasive diagnostic tests vary in their sensitivity and specificity. Advancements in understanding the pathophysiology of invasive aspergillosis and host genetics in differential risk have also occurred. Future work may assist in therapeutic decision-making and patient prognosis. Voriconazole remains the preferred agent for treatment. Additional alternatives have emerged.
