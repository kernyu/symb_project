The prevalence of etravirine resistance mutations was examined in genotypes derived from 1343 HIV-infected patients failing nevirapine or efavirenz in the resistance database of the Spanish AIDS Research Network (ResRIS). Overall, etravirine-resistant genotypes were recognized in 18.7% of patients, with no significant differences between failures under nevirapine or efavirenz. Thus, more than 80% patients with prior failure to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors could potentially benefit from etravirine rescue therapy.
