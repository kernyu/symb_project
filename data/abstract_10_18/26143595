BACKGROUND: Highly transmissible genes encoding resistance to carbapenems have demonstrated global spread. The New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase 1 gene is hypothesized to have originated in India, with subsequent dissemination by colonized or infected travelers. METHOD: We conducted an ecological study evaluating the association between the cumulative air traffic departing India between 2007 and 2012 and published cases of NDM-1. Receiver operator characteristic curves were generated as well as multivariate logistic regression models. 193 countries with complete flight and World Bank data were included in the analysis. RESULTS: Receiver operator characteristic curves (ROC) of the dichotomous outcome of a published case of NDM-1 were generated, yielding an unadjusted area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88 and adjusted AUC of 0.85. The unadjusted odds ratio of having a reported case of NDM-1, for every percentage increase in cumulative air traffic departing India, was 2.3 (95% CI 1.4 to 3.7) and adjusted was 2.0 (95% CI 1.2 to 3.4). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that flows of international travelers departing India by air is associated with published NDM-1 cases, globally. Countries with high passenger flight traffic from India with no reported cases of NDM-1 may be at increased risk of having unreported transmission of NDM-1.
