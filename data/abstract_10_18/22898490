There are quite a number of antimalarial compounds in different states of preclinical and clinical development. Among those in advanced stages, combinations of known drugs or new substances from drug classes already used in antimalarial therapy are predominant. More compounds with novel or even unknown mechanism of action are found among those compounds which are in less advanced stages of development.
