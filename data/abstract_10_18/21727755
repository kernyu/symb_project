The aim of the present study was to investigate the genetic factors responsible for the interindividual variability in the bioavailability of mizoribine. Thirty healthy Japanese men aged 20-49 years and weighing 53-75 kg participated in the present study and took 150 mg of mizoribine. Urine samples were collected periodically for 12 h after the dose, and the bioavailability of mizoribine was calculated from the estimated total urinary excretion from time zero to infinity. The bioavailability of mizoribine in the 30 subjects ranged from 60.3% to 99.4%. The mean bioavailability of mizoribine in subjects with the concentrative nucleoside transporter 1 (SLC28A1) 565-A/A allele (75.4%) was significantly lower than that in subjects with the SLC28A1 565-G/G allele (90.1%). On the other hand, the bioavailability of mizoribine was not affected by polymorphisms of breast cancer resistance protein (ABCG2) C421A and multidrug resistance-associated protein 4 (ABCC4) G2269A. The findings in the present prospective study suggested that the genetic test for the SLC28A1 G565A polymorphism is promising for predicting the Japanese subjects with lower bioavailability of mizoribine.
