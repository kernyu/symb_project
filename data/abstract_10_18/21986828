The appearance of Plasmodium falciparum parasites with decreased in vivo sensitivity but no measurable in vitro resistance to artemisinin has raised the urgent need to characterize the artemisinin resistance phenotype. Changes in the temporary growth arrest (dormancy) profile of parasites may be one aspect of this phenotype. In this study, we investigated the link between dormancy and resistance, using artelinic acid (AL)-resistant parasites. Our results demonstrate that the AL resistance phenotype has (i) decreased sensitivity of mature-stage parasites, (ii) decreased sensitivity of the ring stage to the induction of dormancy, and (iii) a faster recovery from dormancy.
