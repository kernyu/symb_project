Antifungal susceptibility of 150 strains of yeasts isolated from the infected mammary secretion of cows was determined. Their susceptibility to amphoterycin B, nystatin, flucytosine, tioconazole, ketoconazole, miconazole, fluconazole and clotrimazole was evaluated using the disc diffusion method on Yeast Nitrogen Base (YNB) and filter paper discs. The most active antifungal agents in vitro were found to be: tioconazole--96.7%, nystatin--95.4%, amphoterycin--94.0%, and flucytosine--92.7% of susceptible strains; the least active were fluconazole and clotrimazole--39.3% and 60.0% of susceptible strains, respectively. The individual species of yeasts were characterized by varied susceptibility to individual therapeutics.
