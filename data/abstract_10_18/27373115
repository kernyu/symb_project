INTRODUCTION: Multiple drug resistance requires a flexible approach to find medicines able to overcome it. One method could be the exposure of existing medicines to UV laser beams to generate active photoproducts against bacteria and/or malignant tumors. METHODS: The interaction of Chlorpromazine (CPZ) (irradiated with 266 nm pulsed laser beams) was studied at concentrations of 10 mg/ml and 20 mg/ ml in ultrapure water, with pseudotumors of rabbits eyes. RESULTS: The use of CPZ water solution exposed to 266 nm in the treatment of pseudotumor tissues produced on rabbit eyes showed that treatment results depend on initial (before irradiation) CPZ concentration and exposure time. At this stage, one could not specify which out of the generated photoproducts, individual or as a group, was/were efficient in pseudotumor cure but overall effects were observable. Application of CPZ irradiated solutions on rabbit eyes pseudotumors seemed to produce a faster recovery of tissues with respect to control, untreated eyes. CONCLUSIONS: Histologic findings in the treated tissues showed a good anti-inflammatory response. The results obtained open perspectives to fight MDR and/or development of pseudotumoral processes with substances that were not initially made for this purpose (non-antibiotics, for instance).
