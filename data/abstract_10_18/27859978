The prophylactic use of antifungal drugs in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant recipients has revealed that the rate of non-albicans candidemia has increased. We herein report the case of a patient with adult T-cell leukemia who developed candidemia due to Candida fermentati during micafungin treatment after cord blood transplantation. The isolate was identified on day 47 by sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region of the ribosomal RNA gene. The sequencing of the hot spot region of fks1p of isolate revealed naturally occurring amino acid substitutions, which conferred reduced echinocandin susceptibility. This case highlights that breakthrough candidemia due to C. fermentati occurred in a patient receiving micafungin treatment.
