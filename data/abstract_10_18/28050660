INTRODUCTION: Onyx and ethanol are well-known embolic and sclerotic agents that are frequently used in embolization. These agents present advantages and disadvantages regarding visibility, injection control and penetration depth. Mixing both products might yield a new product with different characteristics. The aim of this study is to evaluate the injectability, radiopacity, and mechanical and occlusive properties of different mixtures of Onyx 18 and ethanol in vitro and in vivo (in a swine model). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Various Onyx 18 and ethanol formulations were prepared and tested in vitro for their injectability, solidification rate and shrinkage, cohesion and occlusive properties. In vivo tests were performed using 3 swine. Ease of injection, radiopacity, cohesiveness and penetration were analyzed using fluoroscopy and high-resolution CT. RESULTS: All mixtures were easy to inject through a microcatheter with no resistance or blockage in vitro and in vivo. The 50%-ethanol mixture showed delayed copolymerization with fragmentation and proximal occlusion. The 75%-ethanol mixture showed poor radiopacity in vivo and was not tested in vitro. The 25%-ethanol mixture showed good occlusive properties and accepted penetration and radiopacity. CONCLUSION: Mixing Onyx and ethanol is feasible. The mixture of 25% of ethanol and 75% of Onyx 18 could be a new sclero-embolic agent. Further research is needed to study the chemical changes of the mixture, to confirm the significance of the added sclerotic effect and to find out the ideal mixture percentages.
