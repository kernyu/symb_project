Complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSIs) continue to pose a significant clinical challenge. The most frequent cause of these infections is Staphylococcus aureus, although other organisms, including Streptococcus pyogenes and, in certain circumstances, Enterobacteriaceae, are also involved. The relentless increase in methicillin resistance among S. aureus isolated in hospitals throughout the world has made it important to provide coverage for these organisms when treating cSSSIs in hospitals. More recently, however, there has been a striking increase in methicillin resistance among staphylococci isolated from infections acquired in the community, particularly in the USA. As a result, previous recommendations for empirical therapy of these important infections are now outdated. The papers in this Supplement detail the properties of a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin that has activity against MRSA and is, thus, an outstanding candidate for empirical therapy of cSSSIs. The papers included provide data on the in vitro activity, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the clinical efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil, which is a welcome addition to our therapeutic armamentarium against cSSSIs.
