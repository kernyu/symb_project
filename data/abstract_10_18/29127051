Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic pathogen in healthcare facilities responsible for nosocomial infections mostly in immunocompromised patients. Colistin resistance is increasingly reported worldwide in A. baumannii. Here we describe the in vivo selection of colistin and rifampicin resistance in carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, plasmid analysis and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) were performed to fully characterise the resistome of two clinical isolates (AbS1 and AbS2) selected during treatment. Clinical isolate AbS1 remained susceptible to colistin, rifampicin and tigecycline, whilst AbS2 was susceptible only to tigecycline. PCR analysis revealed the presence of a blaOXA-23-like carbapenemase gene. Kieser extraction revealed an ca. 74 kb plasmid harbouring blaOXA-23. WGS revealed genomes of 3.8 Mbp in size with a G + C content of 38.9%, and both belonged to ST281 according to the Oxford MLST scheme and ST641 according to the Institut Pasteur scheme. The resistome was also composed of naturally occurring beta-lactamases, i.e. ADC-25 cephalosporinase and OXA-82 oxacillinase, aminoglycoside resistance genes [aac(3)-Ia, aadA1 and aph(3')-VIa (aphA6)], and mutations in DNA gyrases explaining fluoroquinolone resistance. Single nucleotide polymorphism analysis revealed that both isolates were identical except for a 30-nucleotide duplication within the pmrB gene and a point mutation in the rpoB gene resulting in colistin and rifampicin resistance, respectively. This study highlights the genomic plasticity of A. baumannii under antibiotic pressure. The 10-amino acid duplication in PmrB affects colistin susceptibility by regulating lipopolysaccharide modification through the PmrAB two-component system. These findings provide further information on the molecular mechanisms leading to colistin resistance in A. baumannii.
