A total of 187 isolates from 470 clinical specimens were collected from three hospitals in El-Minia governorate and identified as 132 Staphylococcus aureus strains and 55 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) strains. Susceptibility of isolates to antimicrobial agents was tested by the agar dilution method. The isolated S. aureus strains showed low resistance to vancomycin (1.5%), amikacin (2.3%) and gatifloxacin (3.8%). Vancomycin was the most effective antibiotic against CoNS. The ampicillin-resistant isolates were tested for beta-lactamase production where, 61.7% of S. aureus and 42.9% of CoNS were positive for beta-lactamase enzyme. Beta-lactamase producing strains were screened for their plasmid profile using alkaline lysis method. Some of these strains carried at least one plasmid suggesting plasmid-mediated antibiotic resistance. When cells of these strains were exposed to curing agent ethidium bromide, the production of the beta-lactamase was lost. Resistance by efflux was studied by a modified fluorometric assay. Addition of uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) increased norfloxacin accumulation in quinolone resistant S. aureus strains, suggesting endogenous energy-dependent efflux. Combinations of ciprofloxacin with four antimicrobial agents against methicillin resistant S.aureus (MRSA) strains were investigated using decimal assay for additivity (DAA) technique. Synergistic interaction was observed between ciprofloxacin and oxacillin. ciprofloxacin plus cefepime and gentamicin appeared to be additive, while ciprofloxacin plus erythromycin was antagonistic.
