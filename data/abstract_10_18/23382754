BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli (MDR E. coli) has become a major public health concern in Sudan and many countries, causing failure in treatment with consequent huge health burden. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence and susceptibility of MDR E. coli isolated from patients in hospitals at Khartoum State. METHODS: Between May to August 2011, E. coli (n = 232) isolated from clinical specimens, identified, tested their antimicrobials susceptibility and screened for extend spectrum a-lactamase production as per standard methods. RESULTS: Of the 232 E. coli isolates, the majority were from urine (65.1%). MDR E. coli were present in 214 (92.2%). Of these, the resistance rates were recorded to: amoxicillin 97.7%, cefuroxime 92.5%, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 88.3%, tetracycline 77.1%, nalidixic acid 72%, ceftriaxone 64%, ciprofloxacin 58.4%, ofloxacin 55.1%, amoxicillin-clavulanate 50.4%, ceftazidime, gentamicin 35% each, nitrofurantoin 22.4%, chloramphenicol, tobramicin 18.2% each and amikacin 1.9%. Overall MDR E. coli, 53.3% were resistant to > 7 antimicrobial agents and ESBL was detected in 32.7%. Isolates from males were more resistant than those from females (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Drug-resistance surveillance and epidemiological analysis of patient data is need periodically and can be informative for appropriate management of antimicrobial resistance.
