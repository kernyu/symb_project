OBJECTIVES: To analyze and evaluate the safety and cost-effectiveness of a gradually-implemented antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASP) in a tertiary care center. METHODS: Prospective data were collected from an ASP that was gradually introduced between April 2012 and December 2013 in 6 hospital departments, over successive periods of 3 months each. A multidisciplinary team supervised antibiotic use and regulated pharmacy dispensations of a list of restricted antimicrobials (RAs). Indicators were prospectively monitored and included hospital mortality as the safety indicator; incidence of multi-drug resistance (MDR) infections as the effectiveness indicator, RA cost savings as the cost-effectiveness indicator and RA consumption indicated the process implementation. RESULTS: Between 2012 and 2014, dispensations of RAs decreased by 67% and prescriptions by 75%; no increase in mortality rate was observed. Microbiologically, there was a decreasing trend of incidence across all monitored infections, but this was only significant for Acinetobacter baumannii (p=0.007). Cost analysis showed a decrease in expenditure for RAs, with an average monthly saving of up to 326,020USD. CONCLUSIONS: Stepwise implementation of ASPs is a safe and cost-effective strategy for improving antibiotic prescribing practice and to reduce multi-drug resistance.
