BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen with the ability to cause severe nosocomial infections and remains a major problem in burn patients. This organism shows a remarkable antimicrobial resistance and is often resistant to multiple antibiotics. Integron genes as mobile genetic elements are playing an important role in the spread of P. aeruginosa antibiotic resistance. This study was aimed to investigate the occurrence of class 1, and 2 integron genes (int1, int2), among P. aeruginosa strains isolated from patients with burn infections. METHODS: In total 93 clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa were screened. The antimicrobial susceptibilities of 9 common antimicrobial agents were tested against the isolates using disk diffusion method. PCR amplification was performed on extracted DNAs for the detection of int1, and int2 genes using the set of specific primers. RESULTS: The majority of P. aeruginosa isolates were from wound infection (69.9%). In disk diffusion method, most isolates showed remarkable resistance to tested antibiotics with highest against gentamicin (94.62%) and ciprofloxacin (93.55%). PCR amplification revealed that 89(95.7%) of P. aeruginosa strains carried int1, but none of them harbored int2 genes. The distribution of int1 gene was highest in blood (100%), followed by wound isolates (95.38%). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a high antimicrobial resistance among P. aeruginosa isolates in our setting. int1 was prevalent and seems to play an important role in multidrug resistance among the isolates. So, performance of antibiotic surveillance programs is necessary for choosing the appropriate therapy and management of infection control practices.
