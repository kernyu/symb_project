Extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) isolates were detected in 315/3127 (10.1%) diseased pigs from 19 provinces of China; the frequency of isolation increased from 3.1% in 2004 to 14.6% in 2007. All isolates were characterised for O serogroups, haemolysis, phenotypic and genotypic antimicrobial resistance, virulence genes and pathogenicity. The most prevalent serogroups were O161, O8, O11, O138, O101 and O26; 83/315 (26.3%) isolates were haemolytic. Forty percent of isolates in phylogenetic groups B2 and D were highly virulent porcine ExPEC strains. Thirty-three putative extraintestinal virulence factor genes that are normally associated with human and/or avian ExPEC strains were widely present in porcine isolates. These results indicate that ExPEC are prevalent in pigs in China and represent a potential public health threat.
