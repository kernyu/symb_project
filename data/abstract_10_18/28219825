Shigella spp. are a major diarrhoeal disease pathogen worldwide and can cause considerable morbidity and mortality. Notably, limited genome data are available for serogroups/sub-serogroups of Shigella. Here we report the whole-genome shotgun sequences of 23 non-typeable Shigella from stool specimens that biochemically resembled Shigella spp. but were non-typeable with Shigella-specific antisera.
