OBJECTIVE: To observe the therapeutic effect and safety of entecavir and adefovir in the treatment of lamivudine-resistant HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B. METHODS: Sixty-five patients with lamivudine-resistant HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B were randomly divided into two groups. The entecavir treatment group included 33 patients, who were administrated entecavir 1.0 mg/d. The adefovir treatment group included 32 patients, who were administrated adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg/d. Changes in serum HBV DNA, liver functions, phosphocreatine kinase, creatinine and adverse reaction were dynamically monitored. RESULTS: At the end of the 12th, 24th, 48th week of treatment, the rates of serum ALT normalization of the entecavir treatment group were higher than that of the adefovir treatment group, but there wasn't statistically difference between two groups until the end of the 48 th week of treatment (P > 0.05). The rate of sera to turn negative for HBV DNA of the entecavir treatment group was significantly higher than that of the adefovir treatment group at the end of the 12th week. Moreover, the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Both entecavir and adefovir dipivoxil might have a good response to lamivudine-resistant HBeAg-negative chronical hepatitis B. Entecavir could achieve better therapeutic effects.
