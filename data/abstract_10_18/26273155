BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus is a well-known microbe that colonizes or infects the skin in atopic dermatitis (AD). The prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in AD has recently been increasing. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in AD skin lesions and evaluate the prevalence of MRSA in Korea. We also recommend proper first-line topical antibiotics for Korean patients with AD. METHODS: We studied S. aureus-positive skin swabs (n=583) from the lesional skin of infants, children, and adults who presented to our outpatient clinic with AD from July 2009 to April 2012. RESULTS: S. aureus exhibited high susceptibility against most antimicrobial agents. However, it exhibited less susceptibility to benzylpenicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, and fusidic acid. The prevalence of MRSA was 12.9% among 583 S. aureus isolates, and the susceptibility to oxacillin was significantly lower in infants in both acute and chronic AD lesions. CONCLUSION: S. aureus from AD has a high prevalence of MRSA and multidrug resistance, especially in infants. In addition, the rate of fusidic acid resistance is high among all age groups, and mupirocin resistance increases with age group regardless of lesional status. This is the first study comparing the antimicrobial susceptibility rates of S. aureus isolates from AD cases with respect to age and lesion status in Korea.
