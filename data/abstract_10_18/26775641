Antibiotic treatment durations are not well documented. Yet, dramatic emergence of multi-drug resistant organisms should lead to tend to decrease antibiotic selection pressure. Furthermore, it could lower health costs and reduce associated adverse events. Unfortunately, only few studies with rigorous methodology have been performed. We present the available data on frequent infections such as urinary tract infections, community acquired pneumonia, bone and joint infections and intra-abdominal infections. We underline the difficulties to perform such trials and discuss original options to a better evaluation of treatment duration.
