Due to increasing emergence of bacterial resistance, compounds with new mechanisms of action are of paramount importance. One of modestly researched therapeutic targets in the field of antibacterial discovery is DNA gyrase B. In the present work we synthesized a focused library of potential DNA gyrase B inhibitors composed of two key pharmacophoric moieties linked by three types of sp(3)-rich linkers to obtain three structural classes of compounds. Using molecular docking, molecular dynamics and analysis of conserved waters in the binding site, we identified a favourable binding mode for piperidin-4-yl and 4-cyclohexyl pyrrole-2-carboxamides while predicting unfavourable interactions with the active site for piperazine pyrrole-2-carboxamides. Biological evaluation of prepared compounds on isolated enzyme DNA gyrase B confirmed our predictions and afforded multiple moderately potent inhibitors of DNA gyrase B. Namely trans-4-(4,5-dibromo-1H-pyrrole-2-carboxamide)cyclohexyl)glycine and 4-(4-(3,4-dichloro-5-methyl-1H-pyrrole-2-carboxamido)piperidin-1-yl)-4-oxobutanoi c acid with an IC50 value of 16 and 0.5 muM respectively.
