Sporotrichosis, caused by the Sporothrix schenckii fungal complex, is a zoonotic mycosis distributed worldwide. Itraconazole is the treatment of choice for domestic animals although some fungal isolates have shown resistance to this drug. The objective of this study was to report, for the first time, the use of (1-3) beta-glucan along with itraconazole in the treatment of a canine with sporotrichosis caused by Sporothrix brasiliensis. The animal had ulcerated and crusted lesions, especially on the nasal planum. Clinical samples were collected for a complete blood count, cytological analysis of the lesion, and fungal culture. Based on the results of the laboratory examination, and after the fungal culture, antibiotic therapy and treatment with itraconazole were initiated. Two additional fungal cultures were performed, which were positive. After 7 months of the animal treatment with itraconazole, the S. brasiliensis culture was still positive, so that the itraconazole was associated with (1-3) beta-glucan. After four weekly applications of glucan, the complete elimination of the fungus was observed based on the fungal culture negative results. The results show, therefore, that (1-3) beta-glucan with itraconazole promoted the case resolution, and it may be considered a promising alternative for the treatment of sporotrichosis in cases of resistance to conventional therapy.
