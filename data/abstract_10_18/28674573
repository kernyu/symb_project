A collection of 94 Gram-negative bacteria isolates, showing different antimicrobial resistance phenotypes including to the carbapenem classes was investigated. Strains were originated form clinical sources from a single hospital in Tripoli, Libya during 2015 and were identified based on cultural and phenotypic characteristics, and fully characterized by the VITEK automated system. Forty-eight percent (48%) of the collection was identified as Acinetobacter baumannii, 50% Klebsiella pneumoniae and 2% Escherichia coli. Resistance to the carbapenem classes was reported in 96% of the A. baumannii strains and 94% of the K. pneumonia strains. Seventy-eight percent (78%) of the isolates showed different multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotypes, of which K. pneumoniae expressing the highest rates of MDRs(i.e. 91%). Emergence of resistance to carbapenems in the Gram-negative bacteria is a challenging global problem, particularly for Africa. Surveillance of these pathogens and appropriate actions are urgently required in Libyan healthcare settings.
