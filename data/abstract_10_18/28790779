BACKGROUND: Device-Associated Healthcare-Associated Infections (DA-HAI), including Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP), Central-Line-Associated Blood Stream Infection (CLABSI), and Catheter-Related Urinary Tract Infection (CAUTI), are considered as principal contributors to healthcare hazard and threat to patient safety as they can cause prolonged hospital stay, sepsis, and mortality in the ICU. The study intends to characterize DA-HAI in a tertiary care multidisciplinary ICU of a teaching hospital in eastern India. METHODS: This prospective outcome-surveillance study was conducted among 2157 ICU patients of a 760-bedded teaching hospital in Eastern India. Clinical, laboratory and environmental surveillance, and screening of HCPs were conducted using the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) definitions and methods. RESULTS: With 8824 patient/bed/ICU days and 14,676 device days, pooled average device utilization ratio was 1.66, total episodes of DA-HAI were 114, and mean monthly rates of DA-HAI, VAP, CLABSI, and CAUTI were 4.75, 2, 1.4, and 1.25/1000 device days. Most common pathogens isolated from DA-HAI patients were Klebsiella pneumoniae (24.6%), Escherichia coli (21.9%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.2%). All Acinetobacter baumanii, >80% K. pneumoniae and E. coli, and >70% P. aeruginosa were susceptible only to colistin and tigecycline. One P. aeruginosa isolate was panresistant. CONCLUSION: Mean rates of VAP, CLABSI, and CAUTI were 14.4, 8.1, and 4.5 per 1000 device days, which are comparable with Indian and global ICUs. Patients and HCPs form important reservoirs of infection. Resolute conviction and sustained momentum in Infection Control Initiatives are an essential step toward patient safety.
