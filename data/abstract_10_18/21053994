Outbreaks of viral respiratory disease in institutions may be associated with high morbidity and mortality, depending upon the viral etiology and the age and immune status of the affected patients. Control of outbreaks may include isolation and/or cohorting, and prophylaxis or treatment with specific antiviral agents may be indicated, all dependent upon the specific cause of the outbreak. Conventional methods of viral diagnosis detect only a limited number of the viruses that are known to cause outbreaks. The availability of sensitive and specific molecular assays has facilitated rapid diagnosis of a wider range of viruses from respiratory outbreaks. Molecular methods have distinct advantages over conventional methods, including the ability to rapidly develop assays for emerging viruses and new variants of existing viruses. In addition, molecular testing allows rapid detection of resistance to antiviral agents or mutations leading to increased virulence. However, high-throughput molecular testing requires batch processes that may compromise the ability to respond quickly to urgent testing demands.
