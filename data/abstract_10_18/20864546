One hundred and three Streptococcus pyogenes isolates recovered mainly from streptococcal throat infections in Lebanon were characterized by emm and PFGE typing. Thirty-three emm types and subtypes were detected among the isolates. PFGE was more discriminatory as a typing method. The prevalent emm types were emm1 (12.6 %), emm22 (8.7 %), emm28 (7.7 %), emm88 (7.7 %) and emm4 (6.8 %) and all isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and penicillin G. Ten per cent of the isolates were resistant to erythromycin and 3 % were resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin, showing the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B phenotype. The emm sequences and PFGE pattern database that were generated in this study will serve as a basis for information for long-term evolutionary and epidemiological studies of local S. pyogenes recovered not only in Lebanon, but also in neighbouring countries.
