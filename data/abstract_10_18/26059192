Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has emerged as a major causative pathogen in complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSIs). Unfortunately, treatment failure with vancomycin has been increasingly reported. Over the past decade, several alternative antimicrobial agents have been studied and approved for the treatment of cSSSIs. One such agent is the lipoglycopeptide telavancin, which was approved by the US FDA 2009. Given its dual mechanism of action, telavancin is characterized by a highly bactericidal activity and low potential for resistance selection. In addition, in clinical trials, it was efficacious and safe in the treatment of cSSSI. The purpose of this review is to give a background overview of telavancin, highlighting its microbiological, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics characteristics, to summarize the available evidence for its use in the treatment of cSSSIs, and to provide an updated evaluation of its safety profile.
