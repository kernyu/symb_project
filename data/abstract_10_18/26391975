Enteroviruses cause various acute and chronic diseases. The most promising therapeutics for these infections are capsid-binding molecules. These can act against a broad spectrum of enteroviruses, but emerging resistant virus variants threaten their efficacy. All known enterovirus variants with high-level resistance toward capsid-binding molecules have mutations of residues directly involved in the formation of the hydrophobic binding site. This is a first report of substitutions outside the binding pocket causing this type of drug resistance: I1207K and I1207R of the viral capsid protein 1 of coxsackievirus B3. Both substitutions completely abolish the antiviral activity of pleconaril (a capsid-binding molecule) but do not affect viral replication rates in vitro. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the resistance mechanism is mediated by a conformational rearrangement of R1095, which is a neighboring residue of 1207 located at the heel of the binding pocket. These insights provide a basis for the design of resistance-breaking inhibitors.
