Both the resurgence of tuberculosis (TB) and antibiotic resistance continue to threaten modern healthcare and new means of combating pathogenic bacterial infections are needed. The syntheses of monobactams possessing hydroxamate and N-methylthio functionality are described, as well as their anti-TB, in vitro beta-lactamase inhibitory, and general antimicrobial evaluations. A number of compounds exhibited significant anti-TB and beta-lactamase inhibitory activity, with MIC values in the range of 25 to < 0.19 muM against Mycobacteria tuberculosis (M.tb), and Ki values in the range of 25-0.03 muM against purified NDM-1 and VIM-1 lystate metallo beta-lactamases. This work suggests that these scaffolds may serve as promising leads in developing new antibiotics and/or beta-lactamase inhibitors.
