The macrocyclic urea 2, a byproduct in the synthesis of benzoxaborole 1, was identified to be a novel and potent HCV protease inhibitor. We further explored this motif by synthesizing additional urea-based inhibitors and by characterizing them in replicase HCV protease-resistant mutants assay. Several compounds, exemplified by 12, were found to be more potent in HCV replicon assays than leading second generation inhibitors such as danoprevir and TMC-435350. Additionally, following oral administration, inhibitor 12 was found in rat liver in significantly higher concentrations than those reported for both danoprevir and TMC-435350, suggesting that inhibitor 12 has the combination of anti-HCV and pharmacokinetic properties that warrants further development of this series.
