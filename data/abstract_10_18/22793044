We describe patterning of bacterial biofilms using polymer-based aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) microprinting protocols. The fully aqueous but selectively bacteria-partitioning nature of the ATPS allows spatially distinct localization of suspensions of bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli with high precision. The ATPS patterned bacterial suspensions form spatially distinct biofilms over time. Due to the fully aqueous and gentle noncontact printing procedures employed, coculture biofilms composed of multiple types of bacteria could be printed not only adjacent to each other but also directly over another layer of existing biofilm. In addition, the ATPS environment also allows free diffusion of small molecules between spatially distinct and localized bacterial suspensions and biofilms. This enables biofilms to chemically affect or be affected by neighboring biofilms or planktonic cells, even if they consist of different strains or species. We show that a beta-lactamase producing biofilm confers ampicillin resistance to neighboring nonresistant planktonic cells, as seen by a 3,600-fold increase in survival of the ampicillin-sensitive strain. These examples demonstrate the ability of ATPS-based biofilm patterning methods to enable unique studies on commensalistic effects between bacterial species.
