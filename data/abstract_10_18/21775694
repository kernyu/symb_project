OBJECTIVE: To review the literature concerning the role of rifampin in the combination treatment of Legionella pneumophila pneumonia. DATA SOURCES: A search of MEDLINE and Ovid databases was conducted (January 1970-May 2011) using the search terms Legionella pneumophila, pneumonia, Legionnaires' disease, rifampin or rifampicin, macrolide, fluoroquinolone, erythromycin, clarithromycin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: In vivo studies published in English that compared antimicrobial therapies including rifampin for the treatment of Legionella pneumonia, as well as in vitro studies including an assessment of rifampin bioactivity, were included. DATA SYNTHESIS: Macrolides and fluoroquinolones have been effective as monotherapy in the treatment of L. pneumophila pneumonia. This review includes evidence summaries from 4 bioactivity evaluations, 6 clinical studies, and 6 reported cases of combination rifampin use. Combined with supporting evidence, the role of combination rifampin therapy is further delineated. CONCLUSIONS: Interpretation of the data is limited by the potential for selection bias and lack of consistent comparators. Rifampin therapy should be considered only for patients with severe disease or significant comorbid conditions (eg, uncontrolled diabetes, smoking, or obstructive lung disease) including immunocompromised hosts and those refractory to conventional monotherapy regimens. Caution for significant adverse drug events and drug-drug interactions should be taken with the addition of rifampin.
