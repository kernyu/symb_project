OBJECTIVES: The HIV NNRTI rilpivirine is being evaluated as a possible agent for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis. We have recently shown that the NNRTI efavirenz may impair endothelial function assessed as flow-mediated dilation (FMD), but whether this impairment is also found with rilpivirine is unknown. We sought to compare cardiovascular risk profiles between efavirenz and rilpivirine in healthy volunteers. METHODS: We performed a prospective, randomized, open-label trial in 40 HIV-uninfected healthy volunteers who were randomized 1: 1 to either efavirenz or rilpivirine. Vascular indices, metabolic parameters, inflammatory biomarkers and oxidative stress were measured before and after 4 weeks of treatment. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01585038). RESULTS: There were no significant differences in 4 week mean (SD) changes in FMD between efavirenz and rilpivirine [0.089 (3.65)% versus 0.63 (2.42)%; P = 0.77]. There were also no significant differences in 4 week changes in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, IL-6, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides or homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance. However, efavirenz led to significant increases in total cholesterol [19.39 (23.9) versus -5.78 (16.5) mg/dL; P < 0.001], LDL-cholesterol [13.29 (19.5) versus -2.24 (13.4) mg/dL; P = 0.009] and F2-isoprostanes [92.7 (178.6) versus -101.4 (215.7) pg/mL; P = 0.019] compared with rilpivirine. Two participants from each study group discontinued prematurely for adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences in the changes in endothelial function over 1 month between the efavirenz and rilpivirine groups, although efavirenz had worse lipid changes compared with rilpivirine. Longer-term studies are required for confirmation.
