Gram-negative bacteria assemble complex surface structures that interface with the surrounding environment and are involved in pathogenesis. Recent work in Campylobacter jejuni identified a gene encoding a novel phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) transferase Cj0256, renamed EptC, that serves a dual role in modifying the flagellar rod protein, FlgG, and the lipid A domain of C. jejuni lipooligosaccharide with a pEtN residue. In this work, we characterize the unique post-translational pEtN modification of FlgG using collision-induced and electron transfer dissociation mass spectrometry, as well as a genetic approach using site-directed mutagenesis to determine the site of modification. Specifically, we show that FlgG is modified with pEtN at a single site (Thr(75)) by EptC and demonstrate enzyme specificity by showing that EptC is unable to modify other amino acids (e.g. serine and tyrosine). Using Campylobacter strains expressing site-directed FlgG mutants, we also show that defects in motility arise directly from the loss of pEtN modification of FlgG. Interestingly, alignments of FlgG from most epsilon proteobacteria reveal a conserved site of modification. Characterization of EptC and its enzymatic targets expands on the increasingly important field of prokaryotic post-translational modification of bacterial surface structures and the unidentified role they may play in pathogenesis.
