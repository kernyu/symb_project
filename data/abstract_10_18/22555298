Five new 1-(2-(5-nitrofuran-2-yl)-5-(aryl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-3-(2H)-yl) ethanone compounds 5a-e were synthesized by cyclization of N-acylhydrazones 4a-e with acetic anhydride under reflux conditions. Their structures were fully characterized by IR, (1)H-NMR, and (1)(3)C-NMR. Furthermore, evaluations of the antibacterial activity of the 1,3,4-oxadiazoles 5a-e and N-acylhydrazones 4a-e showed strong activity against several strains of Staphylococcus aureus, with MICs between 4 mug/mL to 32 mug/mL. In silico studies of the parameters of Lipinski's Rule of Five, as well as the topological polar surface area (TPSA), absorption percentage (% ABS), drug likeness and drug score indicate that these compounds, especially 4a and 5d, have potential to be new drug candidates.
