OBJECTIVE: To investigate the function of gene PA2580 in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. METHODS: We constructed a PA2580 knockout mutant of PAO1 and a complemented strain of the mutant. We studied the function of the gene PA2580 using both genetic and biochemical methods, including antibiotic minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) comparison, measurement of gene expression levels in different conditions, protein expression and purification in vitro and enzymatic activity detection. RESULTS: PA2580 mutant was more sensitive to carbenicillin, chloramphenicol and ciprofloxacin. PA2580 expression was regulated by sub-inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics. PA2580 protein reduced various quinones efficiently using NADPH as the electron donor. PA2580 mutant was more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide and the mutant showed decreased expression of catalase. These results indicate that PA2580 is involved in the tolerance of oxidative stress in P. aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: The P. aeruginosa PA2580 protein physiologically functions as an NADPH quinone reductase which plays an important role in dealing with environment stress.
