Salmonella is one of the most common foodborne pathogens in humans. Laboratory-based surveillance for non-typhoidal Salmonella infection was conducted in Guangdong Province, China to improve understanding about the disease burden and detection of dispersed outbreaks. Salmonella isolated from patients with diarrhea were sent from 16 sentinel hospitals to local public health laboratories for confirmation, serotyping, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). PFGE patterns were analyzed to identify clusters representing potential outbreaks. Between September 2009 and October 2010, 352 (4%) Salmonella isolates were obtained from 9167 stool specimens. Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium (45%) and Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis (13%) were the most common serotypes, and multidrug resistance was high, especially in Salmonella Typhimurium isolates. PFGE patterns of obtained Salmonella isolates were found to be diverse, but a unique PFGE pattern comprising 53 Salmonella Typhimurium isolates were found to occur almost exclusively in infants. Epidemiologic studies are ongoing to determine whether a common exposure is the source of the Salmonella Typhimurium strain frequently isolated from infants.
