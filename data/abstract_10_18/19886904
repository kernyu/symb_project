Tuberculosis remains a major public health concern in Russia and worldwide. Given the great geographical, ethnic, and socio-economic heterogeneities between Russian regions, epidemiological data cannot be generalized from a regional to a country-wide level. We present data on the epidemiology of tuberculosis in Central Russia. We report a high level of resistance to major antitubercular drugs in both new and previously treated patients in the region. The level of drug resistance in new cases was almost twice as high as the estimated average national level. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains that circulated in the region were predominantly represented by LAM-RUS and Beijing genotypes. These two lineages were strongly associated with drug resistance and clustering. Using molecular epidemiology techniques, we showed a high interpenetration by M. tuberculosis strains between the prison and civilian populations. A limited number of identical strains were responsible for the majority of drug-resistant tuberculosis cases in both settings.
