BACKGROUND: The presence of persistent Chlamydia trachomatis infection after treatment does not always correlate with in vitro susceptibility testing. METHODS: The in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) of azithromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin, doxycycline, tetracycline, ofloxacin, and penicillin were tested against 61 clinical isolates of C. trachomatis on 6 serovars, and the MIC/MBC of azithromycin and ofloxacin at different points in time after antibiotic administration to infected cultures. RESULTS: Of the 7 antibiotics tested, clarithromycin showed the greatest activity against C. trachomatis isolates with MIC90 of 0.032 mug/mL and MBC90 of 0.064 mug/mL, followed by doxycycline with MIC90 0.064 mug/mL and MBC90 0.064 mug/mL, and azithromycin with MIC90 0.160 mug/mL and MBC90 0.320 mug/mL. Azithromycin had roughly the same MIC50 values (0.08 mug/mL) as the other serovars isolates tested, and other antibiotics showed a 2- to 4-fold difference in MICs50 between serovars. In addition, an increase in the azithromyin MIC was observed by 8 hours and the ofloxacin MIC by 16 hours. At 24 hours, the azithromycin MICs were greater than 40 mug/mL and ofloxacin MICs were greater than 64 mug/mL. CONCLUSIONS: The current data demonstrated that the antimicrobial susceptibility of C. trachomatis was influenced by both the serovar type and the duration of exposure to antibiotics in infected cultures.
