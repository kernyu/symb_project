Influenza virus spreads via small particle aerosols, droplets and fomites, and since it can survive for a short time on surfaces, can be introduced into the nasal mucosa before it loses infectivity. The hypothiocyanite ion (OSCN-), product of the lactoperoxidase/H2O2/SCN- system of central airways, is emerging as an important molecule for innate defense mechanism against bacteria, fungi and viruses. Here we demonstrated that OSCN(-) displays virucidal activity in vitro against the A/H1N1 2009 pandemic influenza virus. The concentration required to inhibit viral replication by 50% was 2 muM when virus were challenged directly with OSCN- before cell inoculation. These values were even lower when inoculated cells were maintained in contact with enzyme free-OSCN- in the culture medium. The last experimental conditions better reflect those of tracheobronchial mucosa, where HOSCN/OSCN- is retained in the air-liquid interface and inactivates both the viruses approaching the epithelium from outside and those released from the inoculated cells after the replication cycle. Importantly no OSCN- cytotoxicity was observed in the cellular system employed. The lack of toxicity in humans and the absence of damage on surfaces of fomites suggest a potential use of OSCN- to avoid mucosal and environmental transmission of influenza virus. Since hypothiocyanite is normally present in human airways a low risk of viral resistance is envisaged. In vivo confirmatory studies are needed to evaluate the appropriate dose, regimen and formulation.
