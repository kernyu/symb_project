Recent approval of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) against hepatitis C virus (HCV) offers a major advance in the management of HCV infection. These DAAs, boceprevir and telaprevir, when given with pegylated interferon alfa (Peg-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV), result in a much higher sustained virologic response rate compared with Peg-IFN and RBV. The DAA-containing regimens are approved for HCV genotype 1 infection in HCV treatment-naive and HCV treatment-experienced patients. In this review, we present an overview of pharmacology, efficacy, adverse events, and emergence of resistance-associated variants with the use of these agents. As with all drugs, especially newly approved drugs, clinicians must consult the package insert for detailed prescribing information, list of all reported adverse events, contraindications, and drug interactions.
