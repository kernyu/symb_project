Outpatient urine samples are among the most commonly processed in a microbiology laboratory, which involves a high economic burden. The aim of this study was compare cost and efficiency to process uropathogens between MicroScan system (2010-2011) versus a chromogenic medium and the disk diffusion method (2013-2014). In the first period, a total 9918 bacterial populations were isolated from urine samples. Annual estimated costs during 2010 and 2011 for processing were EUR 53,818 and EUR 57,306, respectively (EUR 111,124 total). In the second period, a total 11,728 bacterial isolates were processed, with annual estimated costs of EUR 21,078 and EUR 23,248, respectively (EUR 44,326 total). We included the cost for a laboratory technician (252h worked per year), estimated at EUR 2500 per year. The mean estimated savings were EUR 66,797 (60%).The identification by chromogenic media and antibiotic susceptibility patterns by disk diffusion method was similar to MicroScan in both study periods. Only some isolated Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Morganella morganii, and Providencia spp. were misidentified. The strategy reported here did not affect the quality of the results and yielded substantial cost savings.
