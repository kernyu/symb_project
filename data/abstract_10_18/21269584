Renal AA amyloidosis is a severe consequence of chronic inflammatory diseases such as familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). FMF is caused by mutations in the MEFV gene, resulting in defective control of granulocyte-mediated inflammation. Interferon-alpha is known to induce MEFV expression in monocytes and granulocytes in vitro. We present the first case of colchicine-resistant FMF in which a durable disease remission and regression of renal amyloidosis was induced by chronic treatment with pegylated interferon-alpha.
