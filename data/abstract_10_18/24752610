A novel series of trifluoromethyl indole derivatives have been designed, synthesized and evaluated for anti-HIV-1 activities in MT-2 cells. The hydrophobic constant, acute toxicity, carcinogenicity and mutagenicity were predicted. Trifluoromethyl indoles 10i and 10k showed extremely promising activities against WT HIV-1 with IC50 values at the low nanomolar level, similar to efavirenz, better than nevirapine, and also possessed higher potency towards the drug-resistant mutant strain Y181C than nevirapine. Preliminary SAR and docking studies of detailed binding mode provided some insights for discovery of more potent NNRTIs.
