BACKGROUND: Acute uncomplicated cystitis (AUC) is a common ailment in the urological setting. Guidelines for urinary tract infections are based on large-scale multi-centre, epidemiological and international studies. The objective of this observational study was to establish whether the results of a multi-centre study on the resistance profile of Escherichia coli (E. coli) in patients with AUC could be directly applied to an urological practice in a major European city or whether there are divergences in the resistance profile. METHODS: An observational study was applied prospectively to 502 patients with AUC between January 2015 and January 2017). Personal data were anonymised. Exclusion criteria were the patient's age (<18) and treatment with an antibiotic in the week preceding examination. RESULTS: The average age was 32 (range 18-56). The most commonly detected bacteria was E. coli with 86%, followed by Enterococcus faecalis with 10% and Klebsiella pneumoniae with 4%. Resistance tests showed E. coli to be highly sensitive to fosfomycin (99.2%), nitrofurantoin (98.1%) and cefpodoxime (92.9%). E. coli exhibited resistance to ciprofloxacin (CIP) in 15.1%, to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TRS) in 25.2% and to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (AMC) in 34% of cases. CONCLUSION: The comparison between data from this study and data from a multi-centre European (ECO-SENSI, ECO-SENSII and the 2014 update) showed relatively good sensitivity rates for fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin but significant differences in respect of resistance levels to TRS, CIP and AMC. AUC should therefore only be treated with TRS, CIP and AMC after a susceptibility test has been carried out.
