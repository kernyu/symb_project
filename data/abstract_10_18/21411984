Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T cell lymphoma (SPTL) is a rare subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma for which a definitive therapeutic strategy has not been established yet. We report a case of chemotherapy-resistant SPTL with hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) which was successfully treated with cyclosporine A (CsA) plus methylprednisolone (mPSL), and also reviewed 11 SPTL cases treated with CsA, previously reported in the literature. Our patient was a 38-year-old female with SPTL. The disease progressed despite conventional chemotherapy using cytotoxic agents including alkylators, anthracyclins or purine analogues, and, after 2 months of chemotherapy, was eventually complicated by HPS and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). CsA (4 mg/kg/day) plus mPSL treatment dramatically improved HPS with DIC, reduced subcutaneous tumors within 2 weeks, and finally induced complete remission (CR) after 3 months. Currently, the patient has maintained CR while being treated with CsA for 12 months. In addition to our case, 9 of 11 SPTL cases were successfully treated with CsA, and 8 were induced to CR. Time to first response to CsA was within 2 weeks in most cases, regardless of prior treatment or the co-occurrence of HPS. Our case and this first comprehensive review on CsA for SPTL suggest that CsA may constitute a candidate treatment strategy for SPTL.
