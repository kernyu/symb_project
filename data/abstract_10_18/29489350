The need for effective compounds to combat antimicrobial resistance and biofilms which play important roles in human infections continues to pose a major health challenge. Seven previously undescribed acyclic diterpenes linked to isocitric acid by an ether linkage, microporenic acids A-G (1-7), were isolated from the cultures of a hitherto undescribed species of the genus Microporus (Polyporales, Basidiomycota) originating from Kenya's Kakamega forest. Microporenic acids D and E (4 and 5) showed antimicrobial activity against a panel of Gram positive bacteria and a yeast, Candida tenuis. Moreover, microporenic acids A and B (1 and 2) demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of biofilm formation by Staphylococcus aureus. Compound 1 further showed significant activity against Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus preformed biofilms.
