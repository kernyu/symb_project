INTRODUCTION: Streptococcus acidominimus is a member of the viridans group streptococci and is rarely pathogenic in humans, making it difficult to assess its epidemiologic and clinical significance. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the cases of five Han Chinese patients with invasive diseases caused by S. acidominimus over a one-year time frame. Three of the patients developed continuous fever after surgery, consisting of a successful elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy (case 1), a laparoscopic esophageal resection and gastroesophageal anastomosis (case 2), and a liver transplant in a patient with liver cancer (case 3). For these three patients, cultures of the purulent drainage material grew S. acidominimus. Case 4 concerns a 52-year-old man who developed sepsis 48 hours after hospitalization for hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatitis-related glomerulonephritis. Case 5 concerns a 55-year-old woman receiving regular hemodialysis who had low-grade fever for one month. For these two patients, blood cultures grew S. acidominimus. An antimicrobial susceptibility test revealed that S. acidominimus was resistant to clindamycin and, to some degree, beta-lactam or macrolides. The S. acidominimus from the patient on hemodialysis was resistant to multiple antibiotics. CONCLUSION: S. acidominimus is an ever-increasing cause of disease, especially in patients who are critically ill. It is showing increased resistance to antimicrobial agents, so in patients with viridans group streptococci infections, it is necessary to identify the species to improve the clinical management of S. acidominimus.
