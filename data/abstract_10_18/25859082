Antimicrobial resistance has become a global concern. Though an evolutionary phenomenon, it is promulgated by faulty human behaviours. It is a growing concern ever since first reported in 1940s. Today, a plethora of newer generation antimicrobials have become ineffective against previously susceptible organisms. This is a huge challenge for health care managers all across the globe, compounded by the "discovery void" in the field of development of new antibiotics. If proper steps are not taken presently, the lurking fear of reaching a therapeutic dead end will become a reality. This paper aims at describing the pandemic of AMR from a public health perspective and suggesting strategies to deal with it in an effective and collaborative manner.
