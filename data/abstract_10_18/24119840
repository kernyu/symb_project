BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of evidence to guide the best strategy for prevention of peritoneal-dialysis-related infections. Antibacterial honey has shown promise as a novel, cheap, effective, topical prophylactic agent without inducing microbial resistance. We therefore assessed whether daily application of honey at the exit site would increase the time to peritoneal-dialysis-related infections compared with standard exit-site care plus intranasal mupirocin prophylaxis for nasal carriers of Staphylococcus aureus. METHODS: In this open-label trial undertaken in 26 centres in Australia and New Zealand, participants undergoing peritoneal dialysis were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio with an adaptive allocation algorithm to daily topical exit-site application of antibacterial honey plus standard exit-site care or intranasal mupirocin prophylaxis (only in carriers of nasal S aureus) plus standard exit-site care (control group). The primary endpoint was time to first infection related to peritoneal dialysis (exit-site infection, tunnel infection, or peritonitis). The trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number 12607000537459. FINDINGS: Of 371 participants, 186 were assigned to the honey group and 185 to the control group. The median peritoneal-dialysis-related infection-free survival times were not significantly different in the honey (16.0 months [IQR not estimable]) and control groups (17.7 months [not estimable]; unadjusted hazard ratio 1.12, 95% CI 0.83-1.51; p=0.47). In the subgroup analyses, honey increased the risks of both the primary endpoint (1.85, 1.05-3.24; p=0.03) and peritonitis (2.25, 1.16-4.36) in participants with diabetes. The incidences of serious adverse events (298 vs 327, respectively; p=0.1) and deaths (14 vs 18, respectively; p=0.9) were not significantly different in the honey and control groups. 11 (6%) participants in the honey group had local skin reactions. INTERPRETATION: The findings of this trial show that honey cannot be recommended routinely for the prevention of peritoneal-dialysis-related infections.
