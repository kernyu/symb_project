The emergence of multi-drug-resistant bacteria and the lack of new antibiotics in the antibiotic drug development pipeline, especially those with new modes of action, is a major health concern. This review lists the 20 new antibiotics launched since 2000 and records the 40 compounds currently in active clinical development. Compounds in the pipeline from new antibiotic classes are reviewed in detail with reference to their development status, mode of action, spectrum of activity and lead discovery. In addition, the NP or synthetic derivation is discussed, with activity against Gram-negative bacteria highlighted.
