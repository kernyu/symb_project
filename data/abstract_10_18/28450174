Cryptococcosis caused by Cryptococcus gattii leads to pneumonia and meningoencephalitis, and has a high mortality rate worldwide due to the inadequacy of available therapy and increasing drug resistance. There is a need to develop effective treatments, and drug repositioning is an interesting alternative to achieve new strategies to treat cryptococcosis. Atorvastatin (ATO), a statin currently used to treat hypercholesterolaemia, was tested in this study as an adjuvant to control infections caused by C. gattii. Several aspects of the effect of ATO on the host and the yeast were evaluated, with particular focus on the association of ATO with fluconazole (FLC), which (i) reduced ergosterol content in the cell membrane and altered properties of the polysaccharide capsule of C. gattii; (ii) increased the production of reactive oxygen species by macrophages; and (iii) reduced yeast phagocytosis and the intracellular proliferation rate. In an animal model, infected mice treated with ATO + FLC showed increased survival, improved clinical condition, and reduced fungal burden in the lungs and brain. This study is the first to perform in vivo tests with ATO + FLC for the treatment of cryptococcosis. The results suggest that ATO may be an important adjuvant for the treatment of cryptococcosis.
