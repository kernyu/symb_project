Antimicrobials are widely used in veterinary practices, but there has been no investigation into the classes of antimicrobials used or the appropriateness of their use in surgical prophylaxis. Antimicrobial usage guidelines were published by the Australian Infectious Disease Advisory Panel (AIDAP) in 2013, but there has been no investigation of compliance with them. This study aimed to investigate antimicrobial use for surgical prophylaxis in companion animal practice and assess compliance with AIDAP guidelines for selected conditions by conducting a cross-sectional study of antimicrobial usage patterns of Australian veterinarians using an online questionnaire. Information solicited included: details of the respondent, the frequency with which antimicrobials were used for specific surgical conditions (including dose and duration) and practice antimicrobial use policies and sources of information about antimicrobial drugs and their uses. A total of 886 members of the Australian veterinary profession completed the survey. Few (22%) reported that their practice that had an antimicrobial use policy. Generally, the choice of antimicrobial drug was appropriate for the given surgical conditions. There was poor compliance with AIDAP guidelines for non-use of antimicrobials for routine neutering. Veterinarians caring solely for companion animals had higher odds of optimal compliance with guidelines than veterinarians in mixed species practices (OR 1.4, 95%CI 1.1-1.9). Recent graduates (>2011) had lower odds of compliance than older graduates (OR 0.8, 95%CI 0.6-0.9). The findings suggest that antimicrobial use guidelines need to be expanded and promoted to improve the responsible use of antimicrobials in small animal practice in Australia.
