Bamboo, a kind of forest resources only less important than wood, is especially easy to mildew during outdoor service. In this work, TiO2 sols were synthesized under low-temperature condition by sol-gel method. The crystalline TiO2 film with a diameter of approximate 40-90 nm was used to coat bamboo at low temperature. The TiO2 films were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer (NMR), field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX). The effects of temperature on film crystal forms, its antibacterial, and mildew resistance properties were mainly investigated. The results showed that the modified bamboo in low temperature solution (20, 60 and 105 degrees C) was mainly covered with anatase nano TiO2 film. The nano-TiO2-modified bamboo maintained the natural wood color, texture and structure, and improved its anti-bacterial property from non-anti-bacterial to anti-Escherichia coli, and the bactericidal rate reached over 99%. Meanwhile its mildew resistance property increased over 10 times. So this method is expected to become the new way of functional improvement on bamboo, and has the reference meaning for the protection and improvement of wood and other biologic materials.
