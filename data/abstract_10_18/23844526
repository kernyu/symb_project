Resistance testing is part of the routine checkup for HIV carriers in Israel and in most of the developed world. Viruses with mutations which confer resistance to antiretroviral therapy in treated patients and in new HIV carriers are identified. The results of these tests form the basis for updating the HIV treatment guidelines and contribute to the epidemiological and phylogenetic understanding of the HIV epidemic. The viral reverse transcriptase and protease are the targets for most of the antiretroviral drugs in use today and are included in the standard resistance testing. Recently, genotypic examination of the integrase and tropism test to verify use of the HIV CCR5 co-receptor have been introduced to better support treatment decisions and to enable effective use of all available drug combinations. New and more sensitive molecular tests, such as ultra-deep sequencing, are expected to broaden our knowledge of rare mutations not detected by the currently used methodologies. Consequently, we will be able to improve treatment strategy and life quality and increase Life expectancy of HIV carriers.
