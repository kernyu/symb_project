AIM: To address the therapeutic efficacy of various treatment regimens in genotype 3 selecting randomized clinical trials and prospective National Cohort Studies. METHODS: (1) PEG-INF-based therapy including sofosbuvir (SOF) + RBV for 12 wk vs SOF + RBV 24 wk; (2) SOF + RBV therapy 12 wk/16 wk vs 24 wk; and (3) the role of RBV in SOF + daclatasvir (DCV) and SOF + ledipasvir (LDV) combinations. This meta-analysis provides robust information with the intention of addressing treatment strategy for hepatitis C virus genotype 3. RESULTS: A combination treatment including SOF + RBV + PEG-IFN for 12 wk notes better SVR than with only SOF + RBV for 12 wk, although its association with more frequent adverse effects may be a limiting factor. Longer duration therapy with SOF + RBV (24 wk) has achieved higher SVR rates than shorter durations (12 or 16 wk). SOF + LDV are not an ideal treatment for genotype 3. CONCLUSION: Lastly, SOF + DCV combination is probably the best oral therapy option and the addition of RBV does not appear to be needed to increase SVR rates substantially.
