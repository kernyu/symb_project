We report here the complete nucleotide sequence of two IncR replicons encoding multidrug resistance determinants, including beta-lactam (blaDHA-1, blaSHV-12), aminoglycoside (aphA1, strA, strB), and fluoroquinolone (qnrB4, aac6'-1b-cr) resistance genes. The plasmids have backbones that are similar to each other, including the replication and stability systems, and contain a wide variety of transposable elements carrying known antibiotic resistance genes. This study confirms the increasing clinical importance of IncR replicons as resistance gene carriers.
