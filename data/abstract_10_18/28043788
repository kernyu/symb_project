Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a well-known risk factor for tuberculosis (TB). However, it is not known to what extent DM affects the outcome in patients with multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) treated with second-line anti-TB drugs. The objective of this study was to compare the microbiological evolution (sputum smear and culture conversion) and final outcomes of MDR/XDR-TB patients with and without DM, managed at the national TB reference centre in Mexico City. RESULTS: Ninety patients were enrolled between 2010 and 2015: 73 with MDR-TB (81.1%), 11 with pre-XDR-TB (e.g. MDR-TB with additional resistance to one injectable drug or a fluoroquinolone, 12.2%) and 6 (6.7%) with XDR-TB. Out of these, 49 (54.4%) had DM and 42 (86%) were undergoing insulin treatment. No statistically significant differences were found in treatment outcomes comparing DM vs. non-DM MDR-TB cases: 18/32 (56.3%) of DM cases and 19/24 (79.2%) non DM patients achieved treatment success (p=0.07). The time to sputum smear and culture conversion was longer (although not statistically) in patients without DM, as follows: the mean (+/-SD) time to sputum smear conversion was 53.9 (+/-31.4) days in DM patients and 65.2 (+/-34.8) days in non-DM ones (p=0.15), while the time to culture conversion was 66.2 (+/-27.6) days for DM and 81.4 (+/-37.7) days for non-DM MDR-TB cases (p=0.06). CONCLUSIONS: The study results support the Mexican National TB programme to strengthen its collaboration with the DM programme, as an entry point for TB (and latent TB infection) screening and management.
