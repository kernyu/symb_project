OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity profile of floxuridine, dactinomycin, etoposide and vincristine (FAEV) regimen as primary treatment in stage IV gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN). METHODS: From 2004 to 2014, FAEV was given to 30 stage IV GTNs as the primary treatment (at least two cycles) in Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Remission/resistance/recurrence rate, the cause of treatment failure, and the toxicity profile were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 190cycles of FAEV were administered to 30 patients; the median number of the cycles was 6 (range 3-11). The median follow up was 52.3months (range 8-120). Of all the patients received FAEV primarily, 24 achieved complete remission after only received FAEV, with no recurrence; 6 patients later switched to EMA-CO treatment due to FAEV resistance. Among the 6 patients, 2 died of progressive disease after multiple lines of chemotherapy, the other 4 achieved complete remission after second-line or third-line chemotherapy and 1 of them relapsed 15months later. FAEV was well tolerated. No one died from toxicity. Severe grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were noted in 8 (26.7%) and 2 (6.7%) cases. No secondary malignancy was observed with follow-ups from 8 to120 months. Patients treated with FAEV showed good reproductive outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: FAEV regimen might be considered as an alternative to other chemotherapy regimen in the primary treatment of stage IV GTN, where it had a high rate of remission and a tolerable toxicity.
