Treating infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens is challenging, and there is concern regarding the toxicity of the most effective antimicrobials for Gram-negative pathogens. We hypothesized that conjugating a fatty acid moiety onto a peptide dimer could maximize the interaction with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and facilitate the permeabilization of the LPS barrier, thereby improving potency against Gram-negative pathogens. We systematically designed a series of N-lipidated peptide dimers that are active against Gram-negative bacteria, including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). The optimized lipid length was 6-10 carbons. At these lipid lengths, the N-lipidated peptide dimers exhibited strong LPS permeabilization. Compound 23 exhibited synergy with select antibiotics in most of the combinations tested. 23 and 32 also displayed rapid bactericidal activity. Importantly, 23 and 32 were nonhemolytic at 10 mg/mL, with no cellular or in vivo toxicity. These characteristics suggest that these compounds can overcome the limitations of current Gram-negative-targeted antimicrobials such as polymyxin B.
