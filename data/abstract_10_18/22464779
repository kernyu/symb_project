To investigate the efficacy of 104 weeks of lamivudine (LAM) and adefovir (ADV) de novo combination therapy, as compared to optimized combination therapy administered after 48 weeks of treatment with lamivudine or adefovir mono-therapy, in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. A total of 174 patients with CHB were equally divided among three treatment groups: LAM mono-therapy; ADV mono-therapy; and LAM + ADV combination therapy. The patients in the LAM + ADV group were treated with LAM plus ADV for 104 consecutive weeks. The patients in the LAM or the ADV groups were first treated for 48 weeks with LAM or ADV, respectively, after which the patient's virological response was assessed. According to the results, the patient was continued on mono-therapy or switched to combination therapy for the subsequent 56 weeks. Virological and biochemical examinations were carried out at weeks 48 and 104. The rates of undetectable HBV DNA in the LAM mono-therapy, ADV mono-therapy, and LAM-ADV combination therapy groups at week 48 were 68%, 50%, and 84%, and at week 104 were 80%, 72%, and 95%, respectively. For the same groups, the virus breakthrough rates at week 48 were 15%, 0%, and 0%, and at week 104 were 18%, 2%, and 0%, respectively. Statistical analysis showed significant differences for the rate of undetectable HBV DNA between LAM + ADV group and LAM group at week 48 (x2 = 4.473, P= 0.034) and at week 104 (x2 = 5.795, P = 0.016), LAM + ADV group and ADM group at week 48 (x2 = 14.802, P less than 0.001) and week 104 (x2 = 5.547, P = 0.001). The hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion rates at week 48 were 15% (x2 = 4.543, P = 0.033), 13% (x2 = 4.035, P = 0.045) and 38%, and at week 104 were 21% (x2 = 4.438, P = 0.035), 17% (x2 = 4.223, P = 0.04) and 44%, respectively, among patients positive for HBeAg. Statistical analysis showed that the differences among the three groups for each of these parameters were statistically significant (all, P less than 0.05). When compared with LAM or ADV mono-therapy followed by LAM+ADV at week 48, the LAM plus ADV de novo combination therapy for 104 weeks provided CHB patients with better virological and serological responses and a lower drug resistance rate.
