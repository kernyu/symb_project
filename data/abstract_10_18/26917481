OBJECTIVE: To study the inhibitory effect of antimicrobial peptide LL-37 on Candida albicans through its ability to promote the secretion of immune factors by vaginal epithelial cells. METHODS: (1) LL-37 prokaryotic expression vector pET-Duet/LL-37 was constructed and its expression was induced in Escherichia coli M15. The expressed LL-37 fusion protein was purified and identified by western blot. Antifungal activity of the purified protein was initially identified by Kirby-Bauer (K-B) method. (2) Purified LL-37 protein was added to human vaginal epithelial cells co-cultured with Candida, and inhibitory effect on Candida growth was determined by the glucose consumption method. Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin 10 (IL-10) concentration and IFN-gamma/IL-10 ratio were measured by ELISA at different time points. RESULTS: (1) LL-37 fusion protein was purified to 96% purity at a concentration of 433.92 mug/ml, and was shown to possess anti-fungal activity confirmed by the K-B method. (2) A Candida-vaginal epithelial cells co-culture system was successfully constructed. LL-37 recombinant protein inhibited the growth of Candida with absorbance values significantly higher in the treatment group compared to the control group at all measured time points (12-hour: 3.008+/-0.003 versus 2.967+/-0.003, 24-hour: 2.941+/-0.003 versus 2.601+/-0.003, 48-hour: 2.893 +/- 0.004 versus 2.409 +/- 0.003; all P<0.01). Furthermore, the rate of decrease was also much slower compared to the control group. In both control and experimental groups, IFN-gamma and IL-10 secretion levels were observed to rise at first peaking at 24 hours and subsequently decrease. For each time period, IFN-gamma concentration in the experimental group was significantly higher at 24 hours compared to the control group [(104.00 +/- 1.07) versus (85.17 +/- 0.28) pg/ml,P<0.01]. In contrast, IL-10 concentrations were significantly lower than the control group at all time points (P<0.01). IFN-gamma/IL-10 ratio was also observed to be significantly higher than the control group at all measured time points (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: (1) Recombinant protein LL-37 could significantly inhibit the growth of Candida. (2) By influencing the secretion of immune factors such as IFN-gamma, IL-10, etc, recombinant protein LL-37 is able to adjust vaginal epithelial cells local immunity, and enhance resistance to Candida infection.
