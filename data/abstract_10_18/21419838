The ability of pathogenic bacteria to sense and respond to periods of host stress is critical to their lifestyle. Adrenaline and norepinephrine are catecholamines that mediate acute host stress in vertebrates and invertebrates. Catecholamines are also used as environmental cues to enhance growth, motility and virulence of bacterial pathogens via specific binding receptors. Incidence of multidrug resistant and highly virulent bacterial pathogens is on the rise, and majority of the genes for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and virulence are carried on horizontally transferable genetic elements. Conjugation machinery offers an efficient method for acquisition of AMR and virulence genes, which may be responsible for propelling the evolution of pathogenic bacteria. Here we show that norepinephrine (NE) at physiological concentrations enhances horizontal gene transfer (HGT) efficiencies of a conjugative plasmid from a clinical strain of Salmonella Typhimurium to an Escherichia coli recipient in vitro. Expressions of plasmid encoded transfer (tra) genes necessary for conjugation were also significantly upregulated in the presence of NE. Phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist, negated the effects of NE on conjugation more strongly than propranolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist. This study for the first time provides evidence that innate mediators of acute host stress may influence evolution and adaptation of bacterial pathogens.
