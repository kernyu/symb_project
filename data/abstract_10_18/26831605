BACKGROUND/AIMS: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) rtA181V/T mutants developed by long-term nucleos(t) ide analogue therapy are known to present cross-resistance for other nucleos (t) ide analogues, except entecavir (ETV). Some studies reported that HBV rtA181V/T mutants could induce cross-resistance to ETV and showed incomplete response as well as persistence of HBV DNA, despite rescue therapy by ETV. This study aimed to investigate the antiviral efficacy of ETV monotherapy and ETV plus adefovir (ADV) as rescue therapy for HBV rtA181V/T single mutation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 30 patients who received ETV alone (1.0 mg/day, n = 16) or ETV plus ADV (10.0 mg/day, n = 14) over 48 weeks between April 2008 and October 2011 were enrolled. Virological, biochemical, and serological response at 48 weeks of rescue therapy were investigated retrospectively. RESULTS: No significant difference in baseline characteristics was observed between the ETV group and the ETV plus ADV group. Virological response showed complete response (62.5 vs. 42.9%), partial response (6.3 vs. 28.6%), non-response (25.0 vs. 28.6%), and virological breakthrough (6.3 vs. 0%) in the two groups, respectively. Virological response did not statistically differ between both groups (P = 0.278). No significant difference in the mean reduction of serum HBV DNA and biochemical response was observed between both groups (4.3 +/- 2.9 vs. 4.1 +/- 1.8 log 10 IU/ml; P = 0.294 and 88.9 vs. 100%; P = 1.000, respectively). In addition, no significant difference in HBeAg loss or seroconversion was observed between the two groups (26.7 vs. 28.6%; P = 1.000). CONCLUSIONS: ETV monotherapy and ETV plus ADV therapy were clinically effective and comparable as rescue therapy for HBV rtA181V/T mutants alone.
