Pseudomonas aeruginosa rods are one of the most commonly isolated microorganisms from clinical specimens, usually responsible for nosocomial infections. Antibiotic-resistant P. aeruginosa strains may present reduced expression of virulence factors. This fact may be caused by appropriate genome management to adapt to changing conditions of the hospital environment. Virulence factors genes may be replaced by those crucial to survive, like antimicrobial resistance genes. The aim of this study was to evaluate, using PCR, the occurrence of exoenzyme S-coding gene (exoS) in two distinct groups of P. aeruginosa strains: 83 multidrug-sensitive (MDS) and 65 multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates. ExoS gene was noted in 72 (48.7%) of the examined strains: 44 (53.0%) MDS and 28 (43.1%) MDR. The observed differences were not statistically significant (p = 0.1505). P. aeruginosa strains virulence is rather determined by the expression regulation of the possessed genes than the difference in genes frequency amongst strains with different antimicrobial susceptibility patterns.
