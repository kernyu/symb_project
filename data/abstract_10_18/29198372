A carbapenem- and pan-aminoglycoside-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strain was isolated from a Brazilian patient hospitalized in a Swiss hospital. The clinical isolate carried genes encoding the KPC-2 carbapenemase and the RmtG 16S rRNA methyltransferase. This is the first report of a carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae producing RmtG in Europe.
