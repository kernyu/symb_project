Soil and vegetable samples were collected from 13 different livestock farms of different sizes in Xinxiang of China, and the residues of three sulfonamides including sulfadiazine, sulfamonomethoxine, and sulfamethoxazole were analyzed by HPLC with a fluorimetric detector, The results indicated that the total concentration ranges of the three sulfonamides in soil and vegetable were 7.60-176.26 microg . kg(-)(1) and ND-32, 70 microg . kg(-)(1), respectively. The mean concentrations were 70.73 microg . kg(-)(1) and 7.08 microg . kg(-)(1) for soil and vegetables. The residue levels in soil were all lower than the ecotoxic effect trigger value (100 microg . kg(-)(1)) set by the Veterinary Medicine International Coordination Commission, indicating the low risk for organisms in soil. The concentrations of three sulfonamides varied significantly in different kinds of vegetables and were all lower than the acceptable daily intake values [50 microg . (kg .d)(-)(1)] set by Joint FAO/WHO Expert CommIttee on Food Additives. But we cannot neglect the potential ecotoxicity and resistance for human via food chain.
