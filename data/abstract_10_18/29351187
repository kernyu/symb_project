The purpose of the study was to determine the proportions of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter spp. isolates from the district of Nashik in Western India during the period from 2011-2014. Antibacterial susceptibility testing of isolates from inpatients and outpatients was performed using Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method to determine inhibitory zone diameters. Proportions of non-susceptible isolates were calculated from the antibacterial susceptibility data. MDR was defined as an isolate being non-susceptible to at least one antibacterial agent in at least three antibacterial categories. The change in proportions of MDR isolates; extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing isolates; and non-susceptible isolates to specific antibacterial categories over calendar time was investigated by logistic regression. The proportions of MDR and ESBL-producing isolates ranged from 89.4% to 95.9% and from 87.9% to 94.0%; respectively. The proportions of non-susceptible isolates to aminoglycosides; carbapenems; antipseudomonal penicillins/beta-lactamase inhibitors; cephalosporins; folate pathway inhibitors; or penicillins/beta-lactamase inhibitors exceeded 77.5%. Proportions of fluoroquinolone and tetracycline non-susceptible isolates ranged from 65.3% to 83.3% and from 71.3% to 75.9%; respectively. No changes in trends were observed over time; except for a decreasing trend in fluoroquinolone non-susceptible isolates (OR = 0.75 (95% CI, 0.62-0.91)). Significantly higher proportions of non-susceptible; MDR and ESBL-producing isolates were found among isolates from the respiratory system compared to isolates from all other specimen types (p < 0.05). High proportions of MDR Acinetobacter spp. isolates were observed in the period from 2011-2014. Antimicrobial stewardship programmes are needed to prevent the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance.
