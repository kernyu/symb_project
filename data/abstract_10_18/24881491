BACKGROUND: Occult hepatitis B virus infection (OBI) is defined as low-level HBV DNA presence in serum, liver and/or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in individuals that lack serum hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg). HIV+ patients with OBI may be at risk for HBV reactivation, and often receive dual active anti-HBV/HIV therapy, such as lamivudine (LMV). OBJECTIVES: To determine the presence of OBI in a North American cohort of HIV-1-positive patients. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: 45 HIV-1-positive, serum HBsAg-negative patients, reactive for antibodies to HBV core antigen (anti-HBc), were tested for HBV DNA in plasma and for HBV DNA and covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) in PBMC. Ten patients were re-tested after approximately 5-10 years, including genotyping and clonal sequence analysis of the HBV polymerase (P) gene and overlapping HBV surface (S) gene from 8 PBMC samples. RESULTS: Overall, 42% (19/45) tested HBV DNA positive, especially in PBMC (18/45), including 3/18 that were reactive for HBV cccDNA, compared to 17% (8/45) that were HBV DNA reactive in plasma. In 8 patients on LMV, sequence analysis in PBMC showed that all were HBV genotype C or D. Several carried HBV P region variants at residues associated with anti-HBV drug resistance and overlapping S gene region within the major HBsAg "a determinant". CONCLUSION: OBI is common in HIV-positive, anti-HBc reactive patients on anti-HBV/HIV therapy, particularly in PBMC. HBV sequence analysis revealed that all had HBV genotype C or D and often had P/overlapping S gene variants possibly associated with dual-active anti-HIV/HBV therapy.
