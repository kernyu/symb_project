The management of these infections requires protocols that allow the clinic and laboratory to reach a timely and accurate diagnosis through the differential identification of Taenia species and consequently determine appropriate treatment. On the other hand, the inadequate implementation of treatments and the lack of follow-up coupled with biological phenomena such as resistance to drugs contribute important risks of infection for the population. This case could be caused by a strain of T. saginata with a low sensitivity to albendazole. This case emphasizes the need of developing and implementing techniques that will help us differentiate the species of Taenia in laboratories as well as establish treatments with alternative drugs. It is important to report this kind of infection with the aim of giving laboratory personnel as well as healthcare providers a broader knowledge of these parasites in order to improve treatment with alternative drugs. In addition, improvements in the habits among individuals must be addressed to avoid the increased risk of infection.
