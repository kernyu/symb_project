We report a case of severe daptomycin-induced immune thrombocytopenia in a patient treated for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia acquired in an intensive care unit. Serum antibodies bound to platelets in the presence of daptomycin on flow cytometry. There was no evidence of other causes of thrombocytopenia. The patient died of brain herniation complicating extensive cerebral hemorrhage. To our knowledge, this is the first described case of daptomycin-induced thrombocytopenia.
