There is an urgent demand for the development of new antibiotics due to the increase in drug-resistant pathogenic bacteria. A novel target is the multifunctional enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), which catalyzes the first committed step in fatty acid synthesis and consists of two enzymes: biotin carboxylase and carboxyltransferase. Covalently attaching known inhibitors against these enzymes with saturated hydrocarbon linkers of different lengths generated dual-ligand inhibitors. Kinetic results revealed that the dual-ligands inhibited the ACC complex in the nanomolar range. Microbiology assays showed that the dual-ligand with a 15-carbon linker did not exhibit any antibacterial activity, while the dual-ligand with a 7-carbon linker displayed broad-spectrum antibacterial activity as well as a decreased susceptibility in the development of bacterial resistance. These results suggest that the properties of the linker are vital for antibacterial activity and show how inhibiting two different enzymes with the same compound increases the overall potency while also impeding the development of resistance.
