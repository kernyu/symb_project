Third-generation cephalosporins are used to treat inpatients with community-acquired pneumonia. Some of these prescriptions may be avoided, i.e. replaced by agents less likely to promote ESBL-mediated resistance. Our objectives were to assess the recent trend of third-generation cephalosporins use for pneumonia in the emergency department, and the proportion of avoidable prescriptions. This was a retrospective study of patients treated for community-acquired pneumonia in an emergency department, and subsequently hospitalized in non ICU wards. Third-generation cephalosporin prescriptions were presumed unavoidable if they met both criteria: (i) age >/= 65 yr or comorbid condition, and (ii) allergy or intolerance to penicillin, or failure of penicillin first-line therapy, or treatment with penicillin in three previous months. Prescriptions were otherwise deemed avoidable. The proportion of patients treated with a third generation cephalosporin increased significantly from 13.9 % (6.9-24.1 %) in 2002 to 29.5 % (18.5-42.6 %) in 2012 (OR = 1.07 [1.01-1.14] , P = 0.02). This increase was independent from other factors associated with the prescription of a third-generation cephalosporin (immunocompromising condition, antibacterial therapy in three previous months, fluid resuscitation and REA-ICU class). Treatment with third-generation cephalosporin was avoidable in 118 out of 147 patients (80.3 % [72.7-86.2 %]). On day 7 after admission in the ED, treatment with third-generation cephalosporins was stopped or de-escalated in, respectively, 17 % and 32 % of patients. Antibiotic stewardship programs should be implemented to restrict the third-generation cephalosporins use for pneumonia in the emergency department.
