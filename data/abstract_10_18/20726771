We report a multicity outbreak of cfr-containing linezolid-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis in Ohio. Thirty-nine isolates were obtained from 2 hospitals. Two clones with different mechanisms of linezolid resistance were circulating in hospital A. One of these contained the cfr gene, and the other a ribosomal mutation. The clone containing cfr was identical in both hospitals.
