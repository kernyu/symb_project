Class A and B carbapenemases in Enterobacteriaceae may be detected using carbapenemase inhibition tests with boronic acid derivatives (BA) and dipicolinic acid (DPA)/EDTA, respectively. However, for OXA-48 (like) carbapenemases, no specific inhibitor is available. Because OXA-48 confers high-level temocillin resistance, a disc diffusion assay using temocillin as well as BA and DPA inhibition tests was evaluated for detection of class A, B and OXA-48 carbapenemases. The test collection included 128 well-characterized non-repeat Enterobacteriaceae isolates suspected of carbapenemase production; that is, with meropenem MICs >/= 0.5 mg/L, including 99 carbapenemase producers (36 KPC, one GES, 31 MBL, four KPC plus VIM, 25 OXA-48, two OXA-162), and 29 ESBL and/or AmpC-producing isolates. PCR and sequencing of beta-lactamase genes was used as a reference test. Phenotypic carbapenemase detection was performed with discs (Rosco) containing meropenem (10 mug), temocillin (30 mug), meropenem + phenyl boronic acid (PBA), meropenem + DPA, meropenem + BA + DPA, and meropenem + cloxacillin (CL). Absence of synergy between meropenem and BA and/or DPA and a temocillin zone </=10 mm was used to identify OXA-48. The sensitivity for identification of class A, B and OXA-48 carbapenemases was 95%, 90% and 100%, with 96-100% specificity. In non-Proteus species, the sensitivity for class B carbapenemase detection was 97%. All isolates without PBA or DPA synergy and a temocillin disc zone </=10 mm were OXA-48 (like) positive. In conclusion, carbapenemase inhibition tests with PBA and DPA combined with a temocillin disc provide a reliable phenotypic confirmation method for class A, B and OXA-48 carbapenemases in Enterobacteriaceae.
