In vitro susceptibility of 933 Candida isolates, from 16 French hospitals, to micafungin was determined using the Etest in each center. All isolates were then sent to a single center for determination of MICs by the EUCAST reference method. Overall essential agreement between the two tests was 98.5% at +/-2 log2 dilutions and 90.2% at +/-1 log2 dilutions. Categorical agreement was 98.2%. The Etest is a valuable alternative to EUCAST for the routine determination of micafungin MICs in medical mycology laboratories.
