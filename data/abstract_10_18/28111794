Although antimicrobial products are essential for treating diseases caused by bacteria, antimicrobial treatment selects for antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of administration of first-generation cephalosporins on development of resistant Escherichia coli in dog feces. The proportions of cephalexin (LEX)-resistant E. coli in fecal samples of three healthy dogs treated i.v. with cefazolin before castration and then orally with LEX for 3 days post-operation (PO) were examined using DHL agar with or without LEX (50 microg/mL). LEX-resistant E. coli were found within 3 days PO, accounted for 100% of all identified E. coli 3-5 days PO in all dogs, and were predominantly found until 12 days PO. LEX-resistant E. coli isolates on DHL agar containing LEX were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) genotyping, beta-lactamase typing and plasmid profiling. All isolates tested exhibited cefotaxime (CTX) resistance (CTX minimal inhibitory concentration >/=4 microg/mL). Seven PFGE profiles were classified into five groups and three beta-lactamase combinations (blaCMY-4 -blaTEM-1 , blaTEM-1 -blaCTX-M-15 and blaTEM-1 -blaCTX-M-15 -blaCMY-4 ). All isolates exhibited identical PFGE profiles in all dogs on four days PO and subsequently showed divergent PFGE profiles. Our results indicate there are two selection periods for AMR bacteria resulting from the use of antimicrobials. Thus, continuing hygiene practices are necessary to prevent AMR bacteria transfer via dog feces after antimicrobial administration.
