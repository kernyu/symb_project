Transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy of the prostate remains the gold standard investigation to diagnose prostate cancer. Although post-biopsy complications are relatively rare, the risk of sepsis associated with the procedure means that prophylactic antibiotics are paramount. The most widely used antibiotic regimen includes a quinolone, such as ciprofloxacin. Resistance to quinolone antibiotics is rising. In this small pilot study, the incidence of quinolone resistance was 18% in our population of patients attending the prostate biopsy clinic.
