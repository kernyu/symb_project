OBJECTIVES: Studies were performed to assess resistance mechanisms, multidrug resistance (MDR), genetic relatedness, serotype distribution, heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) coverage and pili virulence factors among macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MRSP) isolated from respiratory samples submitted to hospital laboratories across Canada from 1998 to 2008. METHODS: Isolates of MRSP (n = 1518) collected by the national surveillance studies CROSS (Canadian Respiratory Organism Susceptibility Study; 1998-2006) and CANWARD (Canadian Ward Surveillance Study; 2007-08) were tested using the CLSI broth microdilution method to establish antimicrobial susceptibilities. PCR was used to detect macrolide resistance genes [mef(A) and erm(B)] and pili virulence factors (type 1 pili and type 2 pili), the Quellung reaction was used to identify serotypes and PFGE was used to determine genetic relatedness. RESULTS: The prevalence of MRSP increased from 8% in 1998 to 22% in 2008 (P = 0.0001). MRSP were 51% mef(A) positive, 36% erm(B) positive, 8% dual mef(A) and erm(B) positive and 5% mef(A) and erm(B) negative. Dual mef(A)- and erm(B)-positive isolates increased in prevalence from 3% in 1998 to 19% in 2008 (P = 0.001). The prevalence of PCV7 serotypes (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F) decreased from 67% in 1998 to 31% in 2008 (P = 0.0072). The prevalence of serotype 19A, a non-PCV7 serotype, increased by 15% from 1998 to 2008; isolates of serotype 19A were MDR, dual mef(A) and erm(B) positive, genetically related by PFGE and associated with the presence of pili virulence factors. CONCLUSIONS: From 1998 to 2008, respiratory isolates of MRSP in Canada increased significantly due primarily to the emergence and spread of serotypes 6A, 19A and other non-PCV7 serotypes.
