Recent evidence indicates that nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in plant hypersensitive cell death. Here, we report that NO treatment led to rapid cell death and induced hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) accumulation in maize leaves. We also show that NO induced the expression of Zmrboh genes. Pharmacological study suggests that NO-induced cell death is in part mediated via H(2)O(2). In addition, semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed that NO induced expression of the systemic acquired resistance (SAR) genes, ZmPR1 and ZmPR5.
