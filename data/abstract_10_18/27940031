Development of eco-labeled and effectively antibacterial coatings for final leather products has been desiderated both by industry and by consumers. Herein, PEGylated chitosan modified silver nanoparticles (PEG-g-CS@AgNPs) were prepared and characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. The antimicrobial activity of such silver nanoparticles was investigated against Gram-negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), exhibiting much lower minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) than chitosan or PEG-g-CS. Water-borne coating was formed by immobilizing the PEG-g-CS@AgNPs onto the leather surface through the electrostatic interaction between amino groups of chitosan and carboxyl groups of leather collagen. Scanning electron microscopy and water contact angle were employed to study the coating's morphology and hydrophilicity, respectively. After coating, leather samples showed significantly high bactericidal efficiency with reusability after release of dead cells from the coating by simply water washing. The excellent antibacterial property of PEG-g-CS@AgNPs coating was ascribed to the combination of bacteria-resistance and bacteria-release by PEGylation, and dual bacteria-killing based on chitosan and Ag(+) release.
