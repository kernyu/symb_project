This study summarizes the topical E-101 solution susceptibility testing results for 760 Gram-positive and Gram-negative target pathogens collected from 75 U.S. sites between 2008 and 2012 and 103 ESKAPE pathogens. E-101 solution maintained potent activity against all bacterial species studied for each year tested, with MICs ranging from <0.008 to 0.25 mug porcine myeloperoxidase (pMPO)/ml. These results confirm that E-101 solution retains its potent broad-spectrum activity against U.S. clinical isolates and organisms with challenging resistance phenotypes.
