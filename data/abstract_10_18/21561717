Tsetse-transmitted livestock trypanosomosis affects livestock in large parts of sub-Saharan Africa. In southern Africa two epidemiological situations can be distinguished. The disease can have an endemic nature with high morbidity and low mortality in the livestock population. Endemic livestock trypanosomosis is found mainly in areas where cattle constitute the main host of tsetse and reservoirs of trypanosomes. Epidemic trypanosomosis, with high morbidity and high mortality is found in areas where wildlife persist as main reservoir and where livestock come into contact with tsetse flies transmitting trypanosomes from the sylvatic reservoir. Based on the differences in impact of the disease on livestock health in these two epidemiological settings, the appropriateness of the available trypanosomosis control tools differs. In trypanosomosis endemic areas, trypanocidal drug use could be the most suitable approach. Possible problems associated with the development of resistance in trypanosomes to the drugs need to be investigated further. In epidemic situations, vector control seems the most appropriate long-term solution.
