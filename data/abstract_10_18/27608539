We evaluated the performance of an immunochromatographic assay (PBP2a Culture Colony Test - Alere), detecting protein-binding penicillin 2a on staphylococci primary isolates in only 6minutes. The assay is highly sensitive for the direct detection of MRSA on various culture media whereas it requires cefoxitin induction for methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci.
