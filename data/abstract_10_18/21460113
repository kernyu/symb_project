Understanding mechanisms of antibiotic resistance is important to the fields of biology and medicine. We find that glutathione contributes to antibiotic resistance in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Our results also suggest that glutathione protects photosystem I from oxidative damage resulting from growth in the presence of gentamicin.
