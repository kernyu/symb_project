Novel approaches that do not rely upon developing microbicidal compounds are sorely needed to combat multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria. The potential of marine secondary metabolites to serve as a source of non-traditional anti-bacterial agents is demonstrated by showing that pyrrole-imidazole alkaloids inhibit biofilm formation and suppress antibiotic resistance.
