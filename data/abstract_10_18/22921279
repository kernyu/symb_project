Armeniaspiroles, a novel class of natural products isolated from Streptomyces armeniacus, are characterized by a novel spiro[4.4]non-8-ene scaffold. Various derivatives of Armeniaspiroles could be obtained by halogenation, alkylation, addition/elimination or reductions. A total synthesis of the 5-chloro analog of Armeniaspirole A has been accomplished in a linear six-step sequence. 5-Chloro-Armeniaspirole A exhibits good activity against a range of multidrug-resistant, Gram-positive bacterial pathogens.
