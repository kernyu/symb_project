Inositol phosphorylceramide (IPC) synthase is the key enzyme with highly conserved sequences, which is involved in fungal sphingolipid biosynthesis. The antibiotic aureobasidin A (AbA) induces the death of fungi through inhibiting IPC synthase activity. The mutations of AUR1 gene coding IPC synthase in fungi and protozoa causes a resistance to AbA. However, the mechanism of AbA resistance is still elusive. In this paper, we generated two mutants of Botrytis cinerea with AbA-resistance, BcAUR1a and BcAUR1b, through UV irradiation. BcAUR1a lost an intron and BcAUR1b had three amino acid mutations (L197P, F288S and T323A) in the AUR1 gene. AbA strongly inhibits the activity of IPC synthase in wild-type B. cinerea, which leads to distinct changes in cell morphology, including the delay in conidial germination, excessive branching near the tip of the germ tube and mycelium, and the inhibition of the mycelium growth. Further, AbA prevents the infection of wild-type B. cinerea in tomato fruits via reducing oxalic acid secretion and the activity of cellulase and pectinase. On the contrary, AbA has no effect on the growth and pathogenicity of the two mutants. Although both mutants show a similar AbA resistance, the molecular mechanisms might be different between the two mutants.
