Mycotic diseases are ubiquitous pathologies. Candidiasis frequently affects oral and pharyngeal mucosa (oropharyngeal candidiasis). The immunodeficiency conditions are the key factors responsible for the development of mycoses. Colonization of pharyngeal mucosa by yeast-like fungi is a frequent consequence of local and systemic antibacterial therapy. Clinical manifestations of ENT diseases caused by microscopic fungi depend on the localization of the pathological process. Mycotic lesions in the pharynx are especially often caused by fungi of the genus Candida. Mild cases are possible to manage by the local treatment. Severe infection refractory to local therapy and characterized by regular relapses require systemic antimycotic agents to be applied. The application of fluconazole is generally accepted to be the method of choice for the elimination of different strains of Candida.
