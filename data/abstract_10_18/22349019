While much research has been directed to harnessing the antimicrobial properties of exogenous NO, the possibility of bacteria developing resistance to such therapy has not been thoroughly studied. Herein, we evaluate potential NO resistance using spontaneous and serial passage mutagenesis assays. Specifically, Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were systematically exposed to NO-releasing 75mol% MPTMS-TEOS nitrosothiol particles at or below minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) levels. In the spontaneous mutagenesis assay, bacteria that survived exposure to lethal concentrations of NO showed no increase in MIC. Similarly, no increase in MIC was observed in the serial passage mutagenesis assay after exposure of these species to sub-inhibitory concentrations of NO through 20 d.
