2-aminoimidazoles are an emerging class of small molecules that possess the ability to inhibit and disperse biofilms across bacterial order, class, and phylum. Herein, we report the synergistic effect between a 2-aminoimidazole/triazole conjugate and antibiotics toward dispersing preestablished biofilms, culminating with a 3-orders-of-magnitude increase of biofilm dispersion toward Staphylococcus aureus biofilms. Furthermore, we document that the 2-aminoimidazole/triazole conjugate will also resensitize multidrug-resistant strains of bacteria to the effects of conventional antibiotics, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.
