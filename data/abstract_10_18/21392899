This study reports the susceptibility to antimicrobial agents of staphylococci (n=105) isolated from dogs, and the factors associated with this resistance. The study animals were 23 healthy dogs (group A), 24 with first-time pyoderma (group B), and 27 with recurrent pyoderma that had undergone long-term antibiotic treatment (group C). Staphylococci were more commonly isolated from the pyoderma-affected than the healthy dogs (p<0.0001). Some 78% of the isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent. Resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanate, cephalosporins (OR 4.29, 95% CI [1.15, 16.3] respectively), enrofloxacin (OR 9.47, 95% CI [1.53, 58.5]) and ciprofloxacin (OR 79.7 95% CI [3.26, 1947.4]) was more common among group C isolates. Some 32% of all the isolates were multiresistant (MR) and 10.4% were methicillin-resistant (MRS). The probability of isolating MRS staphylococci in group C increased by a factor of four (95% CI [1.18, 17.9]) compared to A plus B. Multi-resistant (MR) isolates were obtained more commonly from urban than rural dogs (OR 3.79, 95% CI [1.09, 13.17]). All the MRS staphylococci encountered were obtained from urban dogs and more commonly from male dogs (p=0.07). This study shows that dogs bred in urban habitat, with a history of antibiotic therapy in the past year represents significant risk of being carriers of isolates resistant to methicillin (MRS) and other antimicrobials. These factors should be considered before applying an antimicrobial treatment in veterinary clinics.
