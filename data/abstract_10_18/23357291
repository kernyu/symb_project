Tigecycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic with activity against difficult-to-treat pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp., Acinetobacter baumannii, and Gram-negative bacterial strains that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. Minimal organ toxicity and lack of dosage adjustment in most patients are important considerations for tigecycline use. Tigecycline has been shown to be as effective and safe as standard antimicrobial therapy for treatment of adults with complicated intra-abdominal infections, complicated skin and skin structure infections, and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. The clearest applications of tigecycline are for on-label indications. Whether tigecycline should be utilized as therapy for other infections including hospital-acquired infections with a high likelihood of multidrug-resistant pathogens is a complex issue that requires ongoing assessment. This article offers an updated overview of tigecycline clinical studies, current microbial resistance patterns, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic investigations, and safety analyses.
