BACKGROUND: This study aims to determine the effects of artesunate on proliferation, apoptosis and beta-catenin expression in the human osteosarcoma cell line MG-63. METHODS: MG-63 cells in the logarithmic growth phase were collected and cultured with different concentrations of artesunate (12.5 microg/mL, 25 microg/mL and 50 microg/mL) for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. The total number of MG-63 cells and the morphological changes were observed under an inverted microscope. The MTT assay was adopted to test the inhibition rate (IR) of cell growth. The apoptosis rate was detected using annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining. Cell cycle distribution was identified by flow cytometry (FCM), and the expression levels of beta-catenin, cyclins and cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) were measured using Western blotting. RESULTS: The results of the MTT assay indicated that artesunate could remarkably inhibit MG-63 cell proliferation compared with the rates in the untreated control group (0 microg/mL artesunate), and the inhibitory effect was dose-dependent. The apoptosis rate of MG-63 cells was elevated as the concentration of artesunate increased, and all the rates were significantly higher than that in the control group. Additionally, as the artesunate concentration increased, the proportion of MG-63 cells in G0/G1 phase gradually declined whereas that of cells in the G2/M and S phases increased. Western blotting confirmed that a higher concentration of artesunate reduced the expression levels of beta-catenin, cyclin A, cyclin D1 and CDK1 and increased the expression levels of cyclin B1; however, artesunate had no impact on CDK2 expression in MG-63 cells. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated that artesunate can inhibit beta-catenin expression and cell proliferation as well as promote cell apoptosis in MG-63 cells, which indicates that artesunate may serve as a promising drug in the clinical treatment of osteosarcoma.
