OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of maleic acid (MA) on the cleaning efficacy and mechanical properties of root canal dentine with respect to different time exposure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and eighty single-canal premolars were instrumented with rotary-files and then randomly assigned to test groups receiving 7% MA for 30 s, 45 s, 1 min, or 3 min or to control groups treated with 0.9% saline or 17% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid for 45 s. The micro-hardness, nano-hardness and elastic modules were measured before and after treatment, while the amount of smear and erosion in the coronal, middle and apical thirds in root canal were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy, finally, the fracture strength was assessed by vertical root fracture testing. RESULTS: The efficacy of smear layer removal increased with increasing MA application time. The largest effect was observed at 45 s, even in the apical third, whereas the treatment for 1 min resulted in irreversible erosion of the dentine surface. The micro-hardness and nano-indentation testing confirmed that the micro- and nano-scale mechanical properties were significantly decreased after MA application for 1 min. Furthermore, the specimens treated with MA for 3 min presented the lowest fracture resistance among all groups. In contrast, the 45 s treatment appeared to increase the fracture resistance of the tooth. CONCLUSIONS: The cleaning efficacy and mechanical properties of root canal dentine varied with MA exposure time. The application of MA for 45 s was found to be the most promising for clinical use.
