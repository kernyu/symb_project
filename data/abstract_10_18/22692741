In the literature, only three Brevundimonas diminuta environmental isolates carrying metallo-beta-lactamase genes were recently published. However, so far, no B. diminuta clinical isolates carrying these carbapenem resistance genes have been described. Here we report the first VIM-2 metallo-beta-lactamase-producing B. diminuta clinical isolate obtained from an immunocompromised patient.
