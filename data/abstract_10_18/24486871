OBJECTIVES: To determine the genomic sequence of extensively drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii DU202 and to perform proteomic characterization of antibiotic resistance in this strain using genome data. METHODS: The genome sequence of A. baumannii DU202 was determined using the Hi-Seq 2000 system and comparative analysis was performed to determine the unique characteristics of A. baumannii DU202. Previous proteomic results from the cell wall membrane fraction by one-dimensional electrophoresis and liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometry analysis (1DE-LC-MS/MS), using the A. baumannii ATCC 17978 genome as a reference, were reanalysed to elucidate the resistance mechanisms of A. baumannii DU202 using strain-specific genome data. Additional proteomic data from the cytosolic fraction were also analysed. RESULTS: The genome of A. baumannii DU202 consists of 3660 genes and is most closely related to the Korean A. baumannii 1656-2 strain. More than 144 resistance genes were annotated in the A. baumannii DU202 genome, of which 72 that encoded proteins associated with antibiotic resistance were identified in the proteomic analysis of A. baumannii DU202 cultured in tetracycline, imipenem and Luria-Bertani broth (control) medium. Strong induction of beta-lactamases, a multidrug resistance efflux pump and resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) multidrug efflux proteins was found to be important in the antibiotic resistance responses of A. baumannii DU202. CONCLUSIONS: Combining genomic and proteomic methods provided comprehensive information about the unique antibiotic resistance responses of A. baumannii DU202.
