Non-CF (NCF)-bronchiectasis is a syndrome of chronic inflammation leading to dilatation of airways and structural lung damage. Improvements of diagnostic procedures increase its perceived frequency. In Germany, recent data suggest a prevalence of 67/100 000.The outcome of therapeutic interventions is critically related to thorough diagnostic procedures. Genetical or immunological disorders (cystic fibrosis, alpha-1-AT deficiency, immune deficiency syndromes) require treatment options different from idiopathic NCF-bronchiectasis.Therapy is aimed at suppression of chronic inflammation and includes continuous mobilisation of secretions, immunomodulatory strategies and antibiotic therapy, whenever required. Surgical procedures are limited to specific complications (e. g. destroyed lung after airway obstruction, uncontrolled hemorrhage)Macrolides show a variety of immunological properties with favourable results in reduction of symptoms and frequency of exacerbations. Longtime tolerance is good, if individual risk factors are excluded.Antibiotics are given according to resistance patterns in acute exacerbations and in first-time detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and MRSA. Inhaled antibiotics for NCF-bronchiectasis will gain importance, depending on future studies. Currently, they are only used in individualized concepts of therapy.
