Bloodstream infections (BSIs) due to vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfae) remain a therapeutic challenge. This study aimed to evaluate mortality from BSIs due to VREfae in Central Taiwan.We retrospectively analyzed patients with significant VREfae BSIs in the Changhua Christian Hospital System between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2014.Of the 152 patients with Enterococcal BSI, 56 patients (36.8%) were admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) at the onset of BSI and 20 (13.2%) patients were associated with polymicrobial bacteremia. VREfae BSI was observed in 36 (23.7%) patients. Van A (100%) is the prevalence genotype, and ST 17 (41.7%) is the predominant ST type among 36 VREfae isolates during the study period. The 30-day mortality rate was 13.2% (20/152). The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the onset of VREfae BSI in the ICU (odds ratio [OR] = 4.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.7-10.0, P = .002) was a significant risk factor for 30-day mortality, whereas an appropriate antimicrobial therapy was a protective factor for 30-day mortality (OR = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.14-0.79, P = .013).Our results underscore the need to assist patients who are admitted to ICUs with VREfae BSIs. We emphasize the use of an appropriate antimicrobial therapy for VREfae BSI with the aim to treat more patients with these infections.
