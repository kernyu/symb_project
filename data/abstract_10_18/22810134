PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article provides a practical clinical approach to potential CNS infections in patients with cancer, discusses problematic presentations of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, and includes specific testing and treatment recommendations for bacterial meningitis, invasive fungal infections, and opportunistic viral infections. RECENT FINDINGS: The major deficits predisposing patients with cancer to CNS infection are neutropenia, barrier disruption, B-lymphocyte or immunoglobulin deficiency, and impaired T lymphocyte-mediated immunity. Evolving patterns of drug resistance and prophylactic antimicrobial regimens have altered the timing and range of organisms causing infections. Increasingly intensive immunosuppression has made new groups of patients vulnerable to infections such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. New MRI sequences offer the potential to diagnose such infections earlier, at a stage when they are more treatable. SUMMARY: Despite improved prophylactic and therapeutic antibiotic regimens, CNS infections remain an important source of morbidity and mortality among several cancer patient groups, particularly those patients undergoing craniotomy and those with hematologic malignancies receiving either hematopoietic cell transplantation or other intensive chemotherapy regimens.
