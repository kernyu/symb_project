Ten extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) patients were identified among 104 human immunodeficiency virus negative multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients treated at the Tuberculosis Research Centre, Chennai, India, in two different cohorts between 1999-2003 and 2006-2007. They were managed with individualised treatment regimens. At the time of diagnosis of MDR-TB, one patient had XDR-TB and three had initial ofloxacin resistance. One patient who had had a lobectomy in addition to chemotherapy became bacteriologically negative, three died, three defaulted and the remaining three, who are bacteriologically positive, are still continuing treatment. Although based on a small number of patients, our results have not been encouraging.
