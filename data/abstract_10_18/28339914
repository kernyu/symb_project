Rates of colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and/or vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) were determined for 1320 infants within 7 days of neonatal intensive care unit discharge. Overall, 4% and 1% of the infants were colonized with MRSA or VRE, respectively. Predictors identified in fixed-effects models were surgery during hospitalization (for MRSA colonization) and prolonged antimicrobial treatment (for VRE colonization).
