OBJECTIVES: To asses the clinical features, aetiology, antimicrobial resistance and outcomes of bacteraemic cholangitis in patients with solid tumours (ST). METHODS: All consecutive episodes of bacteraemia in hospitalized patients were prospectively analysed (2006-2015). RESULTS: Of 1852 episodes of bacteraemia, 750 involved patients with ST. Among them, 173 episodes (23%) were due to cholangitis. The most frequent neoplasms were hepato-biliary-pancreatic tumours (68.2%) and gastrointestinal cancer (18.5%); 57.2% of patients had a biliary stent in place. The most frequent causative agents were Escherichia coli (39.3%) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (15.1%) and Enterococcus faecium (7.8%). Forty-one episodes (18.7%) were caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) microorganisms. Patients with a second episode of cholangitis were more likely to have an MDR isolate and to had received inadequate empirical antibiotic therapy. 7-day and 30-day case-fatality rates were 7.6% and 26%, respectively. The only risk factors independently associated with 30-day case-fatality rate were corticosteroids and malignancy-related complications. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteraemic cholangitis is frequent in patients with ST, and is mainly caused by Enterobacteriaceae and E. faecium. The emergence of MDR is of special concern, particularly in patients with a second episode of bacteraemia. Case-fatality rates are high, especially among patients receiving corticosteroids and presenting malignancy-related complications.
