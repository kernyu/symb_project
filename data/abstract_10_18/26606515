BACKGROUND: The characterization of beta-lactamase production in Pseudomonasaeruginosa is rarely reported in Nigeria. The objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence and characterize the different beta-lactamases as well as mechanisms of fluoroquinolones resistance among P. aeruginosa isolated from various clinical sources from Nigeria. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Isolates were investigated using PCR, RFLP and sequencing for the detection of various beta-lactamases and efflux pump regulator genes. RESULT: The prevalence of OXA-10, AmpC, CTX-M and SHV in P. aeruginosa was 80, 70, 5 and 5%, respectively. The coexistence of blaOXA-10 with blaAmpC, blaSHV and blaCTX-M was reported in 40, 5 and 5% of isolates, respectively. The efflux pump regulator genes mexR and nfxB were both amplified in 45% of the OXA-10-positive isolates. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of the characterization of OXA-10 extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and occurrence of mexR and nfxB efflux regulator genes in clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa in Nigeria.
