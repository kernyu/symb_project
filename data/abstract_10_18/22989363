The present study found that synthetic flavonoid dimers with either polyethylene glycol linker or amino ethyleneglycol linker have marked leishmanicidal activity. Compound 39 showed very consistent and promising leishmanicidal activity for both extracellular promastigotes (IC(5)(0) ranging from 0.13 to 0.21 muM) and intracellular amastigotes (IC(5)(0) = 0.63 muM) irrespective of the drug-sensitivity of parasites. Moreover, compound 39 displayed no toxicity toward macrophage RAW 264.7 cells (IC(5)(0) > 100 muM) and primary mouse peritoneal elicited macrophages (IC(5)(0) > 88 muM). Its high value of therapeutic index (>140) was better than other highly potent antileishmanials such as amphotericin B (therapeutic index = 119). Compound 39 is therefore a new, safe, and effective antileishmanial candidate compound which is even effective against drug-refractory parasites.
