The aim of this work was to synthesize a set of heterocyclic derivatives of lupane, lup-20(29)-ene, and 18alpha-oleanane, and to investigate their cytotoxic activities. Some of those heterocycles were previously known in the oleanane (allobetulin) group; however, to our knowledge the syntheses and biological activities of lupane heterocycles have not been reported before. Starting from betulin (1) and betulinic acid (2), we prepared 3-oxo compounds and 2-bromo-3-oxo compounds 3-10, 2-hydroxymethylene-3-oxo compounds 11-13 and beta-oxo esters 14-16. Condensation of these intermediates with hydrazine, phenylhydrazine, hydroxylamine, or thiourea yielded the pyrazole and phenylpyrazole derivatives 17-22, pyrazolones 23-25, isoxazoles 26 and 27, and thiazoles 28-31. Fifteen compounds (14-16, 18-25, and 29-32) have not been reported before. The cytotoxicity was measured using panel of seven cancer cell lines with/without MDR phenotype and non tumor MRC-5 and BJ fibroblasts. The preferential cytotoxicity to cancer cell lines, particularly to hematological tumors was observed, the bromo acids 5, 6 showed highest activity and selectivity against tumor cells.
