The genetic diversity and epidemiology of VZV results from an interplay of the geographic area, climate conditions, and population factors. Studies of the genetic diversity of VZV can have direct implications for both the epidemiological and evolutionary analyses and identification of the genetic correlates of VZV pathogenicity or resistance to antiviral drugs.
