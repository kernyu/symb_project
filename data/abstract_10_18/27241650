BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have become one of the most challenging nosocomial pathogens with the rapid spread of the multi-drug resistant strain with limited therapeutic options. It is a matter of concern due to its ability to transfer vancomycin resistant gene to other organisms. The present study was undertaken to determine the emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and the vanA gene among the isolates in a tertiary care hospital of North-East India. METHODS: A total of 67 consecutive enterococcal isolates from different clinical samples were collected and identified by using the standard methods. Antibiogram was done by disk diffusion method and VRE was screened by the disk diffusion and vancomycin supplement agar dilution method. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value for vancomycin was determined by E-test. The VRE isolates were analyzed by PCR for vanA gene. RESULTS: A total of 54 (81%) Enterococcus faecalis and 13 (19%) E. faecium were detected among the clinical isolates and 16 (24%) were VRE. The VRE isolates were multidrug resistant and linezolid resistance was also found to be in three. MIC range to vancomycin was 16-32 microg/ml among the VRE. The vanA gene was found in nine of 16 VRE isolates. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Emergence of VRE and presence of vanA in a tertiary care hospital setting in North-East India indicate toward a need for implementing infection control policies and active surveillance.
