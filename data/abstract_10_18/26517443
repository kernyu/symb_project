Novel antibacterials may be found that can enhance the pipeline of therapeutics capable of overcoming antibiotic resistance by a return to exploration of natural products. Such novel products may be derived from both standard and previously uncultivable sources, and enriched by expression of previously unseen antibiotics predicted by genome mining of productive bacterial genera. Hypersensitive whole cell phenotypic screens can be used to detect novel secondary metabolites from both standard and newly uncovered sources.
