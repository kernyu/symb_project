We reported a case of aspergillosis presented as cholangitis in a patient after liver transplantation, even with prophylactic use of fluconazole. The patient had multiple predisposing factors, such as leukocytopenia, immunosuppressive drug therapy. He died 2 days after an exploratory laparotomy was carried out. The histopathologic finding of biopsy specimen from biliary tract was positive for Aspergillus. And the pathogen was identified as Aspergillus flavus by mycological culture and PCR. The patient was confirmed as a case of Aspergillosis of biliary tract that was responded poorly to fluconazole. This indicated that azole should have been switched to more effective antifungal agents at earlier stage when the patients responded poorly to the original treatment.
