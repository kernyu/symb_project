The Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) based luminescent ruthenium(II) cephalosporin probe has been designed and synthesized, which can be selectively activated by endogenous beta-lactamases and thus provided a localized and specific intracellular luminescence imaging and photoinactivation of drug resistant bacterial pathogens.
