AIM: Long-term analysis of structure and resistance level ofpyogenic microflora in cardiac surgery hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from microbiological studies carried out in Perm Regional Hospital No. 2 Institute of Heart from 2002 to 2010 was used. Isolation and identification of cultures was carried out by traditional methods, determination of antibiotic resistance--by disk diffusion method, sensitivity to disinfectants--by serial dilution method. RESULTS: Gram-positive bacteria predominate in the structure of clinical flora--enterococci and staphylococci (aureus--during the first years of observation, coagulase negative staphylococci--later). In 2010 an increase of relative rate of gram-negative bacteria, especially pseudomonas and acinetobacters, as well as Serratia marcescens was noted. Among all microorganism species a constant increase of antibiotic resistance level was noted. Clinical microflora is highly sensitive to the preparation for final disinfection, but at the same time is characterized by the generation of resistance to the current disinfectant. CONCLUSION: Monitoring of structure and properties of clinical microflora allows to introduce correction into antibacterial therapy schemes and epidemic control measures, as well as register the emergence of hospital strains. High level of drug resistance of the flora indicates the practicability of antibiotic rotation.
