The progress of surgery allowed the timely source control of the intraabdominal infections (IAIs); the availability and use of the broad-spectrum antibiotics resulted in an important reduction of the morbidity and mortality over the last century. Nevertheless, this pathology remains a major challenge for surgeons, internists, infectious diseases and microbiology specialists. The increased bacterial resistance and its spread within institutions limits the antibiotic treatment options and patients'outcome. This phenomenon is more obvious in Gram-negative bacilli which are the main cause of the IAIs. This paper brings into discussion the criteria which would help reducing the use of anti-pseudomonas antibiotics in the initial empirical treatment when they are not necessary, and also outlines the available therapies for these infections.
