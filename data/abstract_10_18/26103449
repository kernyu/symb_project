The aims of the present study were to isolate and identify clinical and environmental strains of Aeromonas spp. by means of biochemical tests and the automated method VITEK 2 and to investigate the presence of the virulence genes cytotoxic enterotoxin (act), hemolysin (asa-1), and type III secretion system (ascV), and also the in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of the strains. From the clinical isolates, 19 Aeromonas hydrophila, 3 Aeromonas veronii bv. sobria, and 1 Aeromonas caviae were identified, while from the environmental strains, 11 A. hydrophila, 22 A. veronii bv. sobria, 1 A. veronii bv. veronii, and 1 A. caviae were recovered. The gene act was detected in 69.5% of clinical isolates, asa-1 in 8.6%, and ascV in 34.7%. In the environmental strains, the detection rates were 51.4%, 45.7%, and 54.2% for the genes act, asa-1, and ascV, respectively. Resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanate and piperacillin-tazobactam was observed in 15 and 3 clinical strains, respectively, and resistance to ceftazidime, meropenem, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was observed in 1 strain for each drug. Resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanate and piperacillin-tazobactam was detected in 17 and 1 environmental strain, respectively. Higher resistance percentages were observed in clinical strains, but environmental strains also showed this phenomenon and presented a higher detection rate of virulence genes. Thus, it is important to monitor the antimicrobial susceptibility and pathogenic potential of the environmental isolates.
