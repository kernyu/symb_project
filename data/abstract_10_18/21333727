ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The flowers of Gentiana veitchiorum has been widely used in decoction form in the traditional medicine of Tibet against tussis, tracheitis, angina for their anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and alexipharmic properties. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of current study was to evaluate the therapeutic effects of Feining, a Chinese herbal formula (national invention patent: ZL200510042636.3) against pulmonary injuries and to clarify the mechanisms involved. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experimental pulmonary injuries were induced by bleomycin (BLM) in rats with or without subsequent treatment of Feining or prednisone as positive control. The pulmonary injuries were evaluated by histological analysis. Also, the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH) and hydroxyproline (Hyp) in the lung tissue were determined. To clarify one of the possible active principles responsible for Feining, high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector-mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-MS) method was applied to identify the components of Gentiana veitchiorum, one of major ingredients of Feining. RESULTS: Feining significantly improved lung alveolitis scores and reduced the Hyp content of lungs, which is an index of collagen accumulation. Moreover, Feining played a role against the oxidative damages by decreasing the MDA level, whereas increasing SOD and GSH activity, which correlated with oxidation resistance and scavenging of free radicals. In addition, Feining alleviated inflammatory lung injury by decreasing tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) expression. HPLC-DAD-MS analysis revealed that there was 1.97% gentiopicroside in Gentiana veitchiorum. CONCLUSION: Feining has certain therapeutic effects against pulmonary injuries.
