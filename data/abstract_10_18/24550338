Fidaxomicin (FDX) is a narrow-spectrum antibiotic for the treatment of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea. While FDX and rifamycins share the same target (RNA polymerase), FDX exhibits a unique mode of action distinct from that of rifamycins. In comparative microbiological studies with C. difficile, FDX interacted synergistically with rifamycins, demonstrated a lower propensity for the development of resistance to rifamycins, and exhibited no cross-resistance with rifamycins. These results highlight differences in the mechanisms of action of FDX and rifamycins.
