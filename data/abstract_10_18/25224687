Heavy reliance on macrocyclic lactones to treat parasitic nematodes has resulted in the evolution of widespread drug resistance that threatens human and animal health. Management strategies have been proposed that would slow the rise of resistance, however testing these strategies has been hampered by the lack of identified strong-effect resistance markers in parasites. We show that the Caenorhabditis elegans gene Cel_dyf-7, necessary for amphid sensory neuron development, also confers macrocyclic lactone sensitivity. In the sheep parasite Haemonchus contortus: (i) strains selected for macrocyclic lactone resistance were enriched in a Hco_dyf-7 haplotype that was rare in the drug-naive population, (ii) the resistant haplotype correlated with the sensory neuron defects, and (iii) the resistant haplotype was associated with decreased Hco_dyf-7 expression. Resistant field isolates of H. contortus from five continents were enriched for the resistant haplotype, demonstrating the relevance of the Hco_dyf-7 haplotype to practise and indicating that it is a locus of strong effect. Hemizygosity resulting from sex linkage of dyf-7 likely contributes to the rise of resistance in treated populations.
