BACKGROUND: Prevailing data on rifampicin-resistant M. tuberculosis is essential for early management of MDR-TB. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the prevalence of rifampicin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis and associated factors among presumptive TB cases in Debre Markos Referral Hospital, Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from September 2014 to March 2015. Detection of M. tuberculosis and resistance to rifampicin was performed using Gene Xpert MTB/RIF assay. Data was collected using structured questionnaire by face to face interview. Logistic regression analysis was computed to determine the associated factors of rifampicin-resistant M. tuberculosis. RESULTS: A total of 505 presumptive TB patients included in the study. The prevalence of M. tuberculosis confirmed cases was 117 (23.2%) (95% CI 19.7-27%). It was higher among males (27.9%) than females (17.9%) (AOR: 2.17; CI 1.35-3.49). Of the 117 M. tuberculosis confirmed cases, 12 (10.3%) (95% CI 6.0-17.1%) were resistant to rifampicin. Rifampicin-resistant M. tuberculosis was noticed in 7 previously treated TB patients (17.1%) and 5 treatment naive patients (6.7%) (AOR: 4.16; CI 1.04-16.63). The prevalence of rifampicin-resistant M. tuberculosis was 6 (9.8%) and 6 (11.3%) in pulmonary and extra-pulmonary infections, respectively. Of the 30, MTB/HIV co-infection, 3 (10%) were rifampicin-resistant M. tuberculosis. CONCLUSION: Rifampicin-resistant M. tuberculosis is prevalent in both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary tuberculosis patients. Previous treatment with anti-TB drugs was significantly associated with rifampicin resistance. Therefore, the use of Gene Xpert should be scaled up across the country for rapid detection and management of drug resistant M. tuberculosis.
