The tuberculosis agent Mycobacterium tuberculosis has undergone a long and selective evolution toward human infection and represents one of the most widely spread pathogens due to its efficient aerosol-mediated human-to-human transmission. With the availability of more and more genome sequences, the evolutionary trajectory of this obligate pathogen becomes visible, which provides us with new insights into the molecular events governing evolution of the bacterium and its ability to accumulate drug-resistance mutations. In this review, we summarize recent developments in mycobacterial research related to this matter that are important for a better understanding of the current situation and future trends and developments in the global epidemiology of tuberculosis, as well as for possible public health intervention possibilities.
