Resistance to extended-spectrum beta-lactams in Salmonella, in particular, in serotypes such as Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis that are frequently associated with clinical infections, is a serious public health concern. In this study, phenotypic characterization of 433 clinical S. Enteritidis strains obtained from a nationwide collection of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention during the period from 2005 to 2010 depicted a trend of increasing resistance to ceftriaxone from 2008 onwards. Seventeen (4%) of the strains were found to be resistant to ceftriaxone, 7% were found to be resistant to ciprofloxacin, and 0.7% were found to be resistant to both ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone. Most of the ceftriaxone-resistant S. Enteritidis strains (15/17) were genetically unrelated and originated from Henan Province. The complete sequence of an IncI1 plasmid, pSE115, which belonged to a novel sequence type, was obtained. This 87,255-bp IncI1 plasmid was found to harbor a blaCTX-M-14 gene in a novel multidrug resistance region (MRR) within the tra locus. Although the majority of strains were also found to contain conjugative IncI1 plasmids with a size similar to that of pSE115 ( approximately 90 kb) and harbor a variety of blaCTX-M group 1 and group 9 elements, the novel MRR site at the tra locus in pSE115 was not detectable in the other IncI1 plasmids. The findings from this study show that cephalosporin resistance in S. Enteritidis strains collected in China was mainly due to the dissemination of IncI1 plasmids carrying blaCTX-M, resembling the situation in which IncI1 plasmids serve as major vectors of blaCTX-M variants in other members of the Enterobacteriaceae.
