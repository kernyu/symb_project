The application of antioxidants has been considered as an important and effective approach against conditions in which oxidative stress occurs. Especially, ferulic acid (FA) is an important antioxidant which exerts potency against cellular damage in the presence of oxidants. In the current study, the resistance effect of FA on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-stressed human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK293) in vitro was investigated. FA (1 mM) increased HEK293 cells' viability and significantly reduced H2O2-induced cellular apoptosis, which was confirmed with flow cytometry and morphological results. Cell cycle analysis indicated low percentage of sub-G0 population of FA-treated HEK293 cells that confirmed its resistance effect. The FA-treated HEK293 cells followed by H2O2 exposure resulted in decreased ROS levels compared to control (H2O2-treated only). The results indicated that pretreatment of FA on cell prior to H2O2 exposure could significantly improve cell survival and increase catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels. On the other hand, reduction in the levels of MDA and ROS was obvious. It can be concluded that FA may protect HEK293 cells from injury induced by H2O2 through regulation of intracellular antioxidant enzyme activities and cell cycle distribution. The reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential was also inhibited by FA treatment. These results suggested the importance of naturally occurring antioxidants such as FA in therapeutic intervention methodology against oxidative stress-related diseases.
