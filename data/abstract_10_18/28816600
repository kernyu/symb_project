tRNA-dependent addition of amino acids to lipids on the outer surface of the bacterial membrane results in decreased effectiveness of antimicrobials such as cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) that target the membrane, and increased virulence of several pathogenic species. After a brief introduction to CAMPs and the various bacterial resistance mechanisms used to counteract these compounds, this review focuses on recent advances in tRNA-dependent pathways for lipid modification in bacteria. Phenotypes associated with amino acid lipid modifications and regulation of their expression will also be discussed.
