Bacterial membranes represent an attractive target for the design of new antibiotics to combat widespread bacterial resistance to traditional inhibitor-based antibiotics. Understanding how antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and other membrane-active agents attack membranes could facilitate the design of new, effective antimicrobials. AMPs, which are small, gene-encoded host defense proteins, offer a promising basis for the study of membrane-active antimicrobial agents. These peptides are cationic and amphipathic, spontaneously binding to bacterial membranes and inducing transmembrane permeability to small molecules. Yet there are often confusions surrounding the details of the molecular mechanisms of AMPs. Following the doctrine of structure-function relationship, AMPs are often viewed as the molecular scaffolding of pores in membranes. Instead we believe that the full mechanism of AMPs is understandable if we consider the interactions of AMPs with the whole membrane domain, where interactions induce structural transformations of the entire membrane, rather than forming localized molecular structures. We believe that it is necessary to consider the entire soft matter peptide-membrane system as it evolves through several distinct states. Accordingly, we have developed experimental techniques to investigate the state and structure of the membrane as a function of the bound peptide to lipid ratio, exactly as AMPs in solution progressively bind to the membrane and induce structural changes to the entire system. The results from these studies suggest that global interactions of AMPs with the membrane domain are of fundamental importance to understanding the antimicrobial mechanisms of AMPs.
