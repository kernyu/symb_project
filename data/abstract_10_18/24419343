We characterized the relative fitness of multiple nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor (NNRTI)-resistant HIV-1 variants in the presence of etravirine (ETV), rilpivirine (RPV), and/or the nucleoside RT inhibitor emtricitabine (FTC) by simultaneous competitive culture and 454 deep sequencing. The E138A substitution, typically associated with decreased virologic responses to ETV- and RPV-containing regimens, confers a clear fitness advantage to the virus in the presence of FTC and decreases FTC susceptibility 4.7-fold.
