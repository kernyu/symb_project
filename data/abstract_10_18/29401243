Objectives: To determine the population structure and change in drug resistance of pneumococci colonizing children before and after the introduction of the 10-valent and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV10/13) in Brazil. Methods: We used MLST to analyse 256 pneumococcal isolates obtained from children aged <6 years before (2009-10; n = 125) and after (2014; n = 131) the introduction of the PCV10 and PCV13. Antimicrobial susceptibility and capsular types were previously determined. Results: We identified 97 different STs. Ninety (35.2%) isolates were related to international clones. The most frequent lineages were serogroup 6-CC724 (where CC stands for clonal complex) and the MDR serotype 6C-CC386 in the pre- and post-PCV10/13 periods, respectively. Penicillin-non-susceptible pneumococci (PNSP) formed 24% and 38.9% of the pre- and post-PCV10/13 isolates, respectively (P = 0.01). In the pre-PCV10/13 period, serotype 14-ST156 was the predominant penicillin-non-susceptible lineage, but it was not detected in the post-PCV10/13 period. Serotype 14-ST156 and serotype 19A-ST320 complex isolates had the highest penicillin and ceftriaxone MICs in the pre- and post-PCV10/13 periods, respectively. In turn, serotype 6C-CC386 comprised almost 30% of the PNSP and over 40% of the erythromycin-resistant isolates (MIC >256 mg/L) in the post-PCV10/13 period. Conclusions: Although PNSP strains were polyclonal, most resistant isolates belonged to a single genotype from each period. Higher erythromycin resistance prevalence (42%) in the post-PCV10/13 period was mainly attributed to MDR serotype 6C-CC386. Ongoing surveillance of pneumococcal clonal composition is important to evaluate PCV use outcomes and to identify factors other than PCVs that drive pneumococcal drug resistance evolution.
