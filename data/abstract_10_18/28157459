BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a serious obstacle to successful TB control. The 2010-2011 Bangladesh Drug Resistance Survey (DRS) showed MDR-TB prevalence to be 7% overall, 1.4% in new and 28.5% in previously treated patients. We aimed to determine the rate of MDR-TB in selected sentinel sites in Bangladesh. METHODS: Fourteen hospitals from the seven divisions in Bangladesh were selected as sentinel surveillance sites. Newly registered TB patients were systematically enrolled from August 2011 to December 2014. Sputum specimens were processed for culture and drug susceptibility testing by the proportion method using Lowenstein-Jensen medium. RESULTS: Specimens from 1906 (84%) of 2270 enrolled patients were analysed. Isolates from 61 (3.2%) were identified as having MDR-TB. The proportion of MDR-TB was 2.3% among new and 13.8% among previously treated TB patients (P < 0.001). The overall proportion of MDR-TB was 3.2%:3.5% in males and 2.3% in females; by age, the MDR-TB rate was highest (5.2%) in those aged >/=65 years. CONCLUSIONS: The high proportion of MDR-TB among new patients found in this sentinel surveillance significantly differs from that reported in the DRS. While the sentinel surveillance sites were not designed to be nationally representative, it is worrying to observe a higher number of MDR-TB cases among new patients.
