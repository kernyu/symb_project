Looking back to our recent work that challenged the paradigm of trehalose in stress resistance in yeast, our objective was to revisit the role of this disaccharide in chronological life span (CLS), and in the control of apoptosis. Using a catalytically dead variant of the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (Tps1) protein, (the first enzyme in the trehalose biosynthetic pathway), and by manipulating intracellular trehalose independently of this pathway, we demonstrated that trehalose has no role in CLS or in the inhibition of acetic acid or H202-triggered cell death. We showed instead that, in the absence of any apoptotic stimulus, the Tps1 protein itself was necessary in preventing massive, spontaneous commitment of yeast cells to apoptosis during growth. Without Tps1p, the life span was shortened and cells were sensitized to acetic acid (AA) and H202, whereas the overexpression of the inactive variant of Tps1p almost abolished AA-triggered apoptosis. Genetic interaction analysis of TPS1 and genes such as YCA1, NUC1 and AIF1 indicated that these key executioners of cell death partially relayed tps1Delta-triggered signaling. Our results suggested that the pro-survival role of Tps1p could be connected with its ability to preserve ATP levels in yeast cells.
