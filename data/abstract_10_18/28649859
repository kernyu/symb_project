Antibiotic resistance poses a significant global threat, yet clinically inappropriate antibiotic use within hospitals continues despite the implementation of abatement strategies. Antibiotic use and the viability of existing antibiotic options now sit precariously at the nexus of political will, institutional governance and clinical priorities 'at the bedside'. Yet no study has hitherto explored the perspectives of managers, instead of focusing on clinicians. In this article, drawing on qualitative interviews with hospital managers, we explore accounts of responding to antimicrobial resistance, managing antibiotic governance and negotiating clinical and managerial priorities. We argue that the managers' accounts articulate the problematic nexus of measurement and accountability, the downflow effects of political will, and core tensions within the hospital between moral, managerial and medical authority. We apply Bourdieu's theory of practice to argue that an understanding of the logics of practice within the 'hospital management classes' will be critical in efforts to protect antibiotics for future generations.
