Bacterial infections of the central nervous system, especially acute infections such as bacterial meningitis require immediate, invariably empiric antibiotic therapy due to the widespread emergence of resistance among bacterial species. Nosocomial infections by Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been described with an increasing trend towards multidrug resistance. P. aeruginosa isolates n = 53 (66%) isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were used for this study. Antibiotic resistance in 53 P. aeruginosa clinical isolates from 80 CSF samples were evaluated. Of these, n = 42 (80%) of the isolates showed multidrug resistance to more than eight antibiotics and n = 17 (32%) isolates were found to be imipenem resistant P. aeruginosa (IMPR-Pa). Genotypical examination by ERIC based PCR revealed minor genetic variations. Polymicrobial infections are common in the CSF samples. However, high prevalence of P. aeruginosa as an opportunistic pathogen has been developing with increased resistance to antimicrobial agents and thus becoming a significant threat.
