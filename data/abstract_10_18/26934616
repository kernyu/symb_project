INTRODUCTION: Urinary tract inflammation is a very common clinical condition. It is caused by several pathogens and antibiotic treatment is the mainstay of therapy. Increasing antimicrobial resistance and high recurrence rates represent a challenge. Consequently, there is an unmet need for new therapeutic options. AREAS COVERED: The authors discuss the rationale of emerging management strategies and current experimentation. Furthermore, they focus on both acute and recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and examine a range of therapeutics, including new antibiotics, vaccines, mannosides, hyaluronic acid, probiotics, immunomodulant agents and novel compounds derived from nanotechnology. EXPERT OPINION: Basic science studies have elucidated the pathogenesis of UTIs and built up the ground for the development of new therapies. Evidence is mainly derived from animal studies on murine models of bacterial cystitis. However, clinical trials are scanty and cannot provide us with robust evidence. Hetereogeneity and virulence of uropathogens pose a threat that scientists and clinicians are struggling to overcome.
