Fluoroquinolones (FQs) have been increasingly used for effective treatment of infections caused by rapidly growing mycobacteria, and resistance to this drug has been predominantly attributed to gyrA and gyrB mutations. Accordingly, this study investigated a total of 36 Mycobacterium massiliense clinical isolates for their susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and presence of gyrA and gyrB gene mutations. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values, determined by broth microdilution method, of 35 ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates ranged between 4 and 16 mug/mL and a single susceptible isolate was obtained. A total of 31 of 35 (88.5%) ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates presented an amino acid substitution at codon 90 (Ala-90-->Val) and no isolate presented mutation at position Asp-94. Moreover, 4 of 35 (11.4%) ciprofloxacin-resistant and one susceptible isolate had no mutation in Ala-90 and Asp-94. No gyrB mutation was observed in all tested M. massiliense isolates. In conclusion, our results have shown that mutations of gyrA codon 90 are frequent and may constitute an important mechanism of resistance to FQ in M. massiliense.
