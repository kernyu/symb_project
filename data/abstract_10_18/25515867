OBJECTIVE: To describe the first reported successful use of adjunctive linezolid bladder irrigation. CASE SUMMARY: An 89-year-old woman with 10% TBSA burns developed septic shock and anuric acute kidney insufficiency. She acquired a urinary tract infection caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm). Based on clinical status, a linezolid bladder irrigation was initiated in addition to high-dose intravenous linezolid and demonstrated microbiological cure with 7 days of treatment. DISCUSSION: Linezolid is primarily hepatically cleared and has no labeled indication for urinary tract infections. Anuria adds an additional complication of potentially reduced urinary drug concentrations. Bladder irrigation offers the benefit of achieving high local drug concentrations, but there are no data regarding such a route for linezolid. This case report is the first demonstrating the use, stability, safety, and efficacy of linezolid as a continuous bladder irrigation. CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid use as a bladder irrigation may be a feasible route of administration in anuric, critically ill patients with VREfm and few antimicrobial options. Further studies are warranted.
