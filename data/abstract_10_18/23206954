We induced sulfadiazine resistance in two sulfadiazine sensitive strains of Toxoplasma gondii, RH (Type I) and ME-49 (Type II) in vitro by using drug pressure. At first, sulfadiazine susceptibility of the two sensitive strains and two naturally resistant strains of T. gondii was evaluated on Vero cells using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The IC(50) values of sulfadiazine were 77 mug/mL for RH, 51 mug/mL for ME-49 and higher than 1000 mug/mL for the two natural resistant strains. Secondly, induced resistance of the strains by gradually increase sulfadiazine concentration was verified by this test, which resulted IC(50) values at higher than 1000 mug/mL. In conclusion we developed in vitro two sulfadiazine resistant strains called RH-R(SDZ) and ME-49-R(SDZ). These strains resistant to sulfadiazine would be useful to characterize resistance mechanisms to sulfadiazine.
