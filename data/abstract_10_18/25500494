Microbes commonly adhere to surfaces, aggregate in self-produced extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and live in biofilms. Periodontitis is a serious oral infection that is initiated by the formation of biofilms by Porphyromonas gingivalis. EPS act as a barrier that protects biofilm-forming cells against sources of stress, including those induced by host immune cells and antimicrobial agents. Therefore, drugs intended to kill such micro-organisms cannot be used for the treatment of biofilm infections. Our previous studies revealed that subminimal inhibitory concentrations (subMIC) of two macrolide antibiotics (azithromycin, AZM and erythromycin, ERY) reduced P. gingivalis biofilms. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the Bacillus subtilis sinR orthologue (PGN_0088) inhibits the synthesis of carbohydrates that are components of EPS in P. gingivalis biofilms. Here, we constructed a novel sinR mutant from P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 and reveal that the increased abundance of carbohydrate in EPS of the mutant led to a reduced infiltration rate of AZM and ERY through EPS, and consequently elevated biofilm resistance to these macrolides. Detailed elucidation of the interaction between the product of the sinR gene and EPS will assist in the development of novel approaches that target EPS to prevent and inhibit the formation of biofilms.
