Antibiotic resistance is a major global health concern that requires action across all sectors of society. In particular, to allow conservative and effective use of antibiotics clinical settings require better diagnostic tools that provide rapid determination of antimicrobial susceptibility. We present a method for rapid and scalable antimicrobial susceptibility testing using stationary nanoliter droplet arrays that is capable of delivering results in approximately half the time of conventional methods, allowing its results to be used the same working day. In addition, we present an algorithm for automated data analysis and a multiplexing system promoting practicality and translatability for clinical settings. We test the efficacy of our approach on numerous clinical isolates and demonstrate a 2-d reduction in diagnostic time when testing bacteria isolated directly from urine samples.
