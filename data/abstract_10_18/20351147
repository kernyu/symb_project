We set up a polarized cell culture model to study the pathogenicity of a common respiratory tract pathogen, Chlamydia pneumoniae. Immunofluorescence staining of ZO-1 (a tight junction protein) and Na(+)K(+) ATPase (a protein pump localized at the basolateral membrane in the polarized epithelial cells), as well as TER measurements, suggested that the filter-grown Calu-3 cells, but not the A549 cells, were polarized when grown on collagen-coated membranes. Both the flat and the filter-grown cultures were infected with C. pneumoniae. Infection in the polarized Calu-3 cultures produced more C. pneumoniae genome equivalents than infection in the flat cultures. However, this progeny was not as infective as that in the flat cultures. The maximum amount of C. pneumoniae was detected at 6 days postinfection in the filter-grown A549 cells, indicating a slower developmental cycle than that observed in the flat A549 cultures. The effect of cycloheximide on the growth of C. pneumoniae in the polarized cells was negligible. Furthermore, the infection in the polarized Calu-3 cells was resistant to doxycycline, and several cytokines were released mainly on the apical side of the polarized cells in response to C. pneumoniae infection. These findings indicate that the growth of chlamydiae was altered in the filter-grown epithelial culture system. The diminished production of infective progeny of C. pneumoniae, together with the resistance to doxycycline and polarized secretion of cytokines from the infected Calu-3 cells, suggests that this model is useful for examining epithelial cell responses to C. pneumoniae infection, and it might better resemble in vivo infection in respiratory epithelial cells.
