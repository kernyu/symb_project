Falcipain-2 is a papain family cysteine protease and an emerging antimalarial drug target. A pseudo-tripeptide scaffold I was designed using in silico screening tools and the three dimensional structures of falcipain-2, falcipain-3, and papain. This scaffold was investigated at four positions, T1, T2, T3, and T3', with various targeted substitutions to understand the structure-activity relationships. Inhibitor synthesis was accomplished by first obtaining the appropriate dipeptide precursors with common structural components. The pyrrolidine moiety introduced interesting rotamers in a number of synthesized molecules, which was confirmed using high-temperature (1)H NMR spectroscopy. Among the synthesized compounds, 61, 62, and 66 inhibited falcipain-2 activity with inhibition constants (Ki) of 1.8 +/- 1.1, 0.2 +/- 0.1 and 7.0 +/- 2.3 muM, respectively. A group of molecules with a pyrrolidine moiety at the T2 position (68, 70, 71, 72, and 73) also potently inhibited falcipain-2 activity (Ki=0.4 +/- 0.1, 2.5 +/- 0.5, 3.3 +/- 1.1, 7.5 +/- 1.9, and 4.6 +/- 0.7 muM, respectively). Overall, compound 74 exhibited potent anti-parasitic activity (IC(5)(0)=0.9 +/- 0.1 muM), corresponding with its inhibitory activity against falcipain-2, with a Ki of 1.1 +/- 0.1 muM. Compounds 62 and 67 inhibited the growth of the drug resistant parasite Dd2 with better efficacy, and compound 74 exhibited a 7- to 12-fold higher potency against Dd2 and MCamp isolates, than the laboratory strain (3D7). These data suggest that this novel series of compounds should be further investigated as potential antimalarial agents.
