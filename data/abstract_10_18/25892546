Streptomyces sp. Tu 6176 produces the cytotoxic benzoxazole nataxazole. Bioinformatic analysis of the genome of this organism predicts the presence of 38 putative secondary-metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters, including those involved in the biosynthesis of AJI9561 and its derivative nataxazole, the antibiotic hygromycin B, and ionophores enterobactin and coelibactin. The nataxazole biosynthesis gene cluster was identified and characterized: it lacks the O-methyltransferase gene required to convert AJI9561 into nataxazole. This O-methyltransferase activity might act as a resistance mechanism, as AJI9561 shows antibiotic activity whereas nataxazole is inactive. Moreover, heterologous expression of the nataxazole biosynthesis gene cluster in S. lividans JT46 resulted in the production of AJI9561. Nataxazole biosynthesis requires the shikimate pathway to generate 3-hydroxyanthranilate and an iterative type I PKS to generate 6-methylsalicylate. Production of nataxazole was improved up to fourfold by disrupting one regulatory gene in the cluster. An additional benzoxazole, 5-hydroxynataxazole is produced by Streptomyces sp. Tu 6176. 5-Hydroxynataxazole derives from nataxazole by the activity of an as yet unidentified oxygenase; this implies cross-talk between the nataxazole biosynthesis pathway and an unknown pathway.
