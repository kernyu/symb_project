Osteomyelitis is a severe bone infection frequently caused by Staphylococcus aureus, which shows significant resistance to methicillin. One therapeutic treatment would be to insert a bone substitute loaded to an antibiotic, which would enable the bone to be filled while the illness is being treated. Linezolid is an oxazolidinone antibiotic with a large spectrum of action. It is effective against most Gram-positive bacteria and displays a specific mode of action. The aim of this work was to study the association of linezolid with a calcium phosphate-deficient apatite matrix. Granules containing 10% and 50% linezolid were prepared by wet granulation and characterized. Porosity analyses performed by mercury porosimetry and scanning electron microscopy revealed that grain porosity with 50% linezolid was higher than that of the grains containing 10% linezolid. NMR analyses showed no change in structure of linezolid when linked to calcium-deficient apatite. These results were confirmed by studying the antibacterial activity of linezolid, which remained proportional to the quantity of loaded linezolid, proving that the antibiotic released was active. The in vitro release time varied from 9 days for granules containing 10% linezolid to 26 days for granules containing 50% linezolid.
