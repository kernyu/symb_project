Viral fitness of a laninamivir-selected influenza A/Brisbane/10/2007-like (H3N2) isolate (LRVp9) containing a 237-amino acid neuraminidase deletion and a P194L hemagglutinin mutation was evaluated in vitro and in ferrets. LRVp9 and the wild-type (WT) virus showed comparable replication kinetics in MDCK-ST6GalI cells. Cultured virus was recovered between days 2 and 5 post-infection in nasal washes (NW) from the 4 WT-infected ferrets whereas no virus was recovered from the LRVp9-infected animals. There was a >/=1 log reduction in viral RNA copies/mul of NW for LRVp9 compared to WT at most time points. The large neuraminidase deletion compromises viral infectivity in vivo.
