BACKGROUND: The aims of this study were to compare disk diffusion with E-test method for levofloxacin susceptibility testing of Helicobacter pylori and standardized breakpoints for disk diffusion as a stable and reliable method for determining qualitative levofloxacin susceptibility. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We determined the levofloxacin susceptibility of 45 H. pylori strains isolated from Chinese patients by the E-test method. Disk diffusion was evaluated as an alternative method to determine susceptibility and compared with the E-test results by linear regression analysis. RESULTS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values tested by E-test method ranged from 0.047 to 32 mug/mL. Resistance to levofloxacin was detected in 16 (35.6%) isolates. The levofloxacin disk zone sizes obtained by disk diffusion method correlated well (r(2) = .877) with the MICs obtained by E-test method. As a consequence of regression analysis, isolates with inhibition diameters < 12 mm were considered resistant to levofloxacin. There was 100% agreement between the two methods for levofloxacin, applying the regression-based breakpoints. CONCLUSIONS: The disk diffusion method is equivalent to the E-test method for testing levofloxacin susceptibility of H. pylori strains; it is more practical and inexpensive, and it is suitable for the analysis of a small number of isolates compared with the E-test method.
