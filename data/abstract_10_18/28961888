Objectives: This study investigated the trend in antimicrobial resistance among group B Streptococcus (GBS) from a national surveillance programme in Taiwan and delineated characteristics of and factors associated with levofloxacin-resistant isolates. Methods: Clinical isolates of all sample types and patient groups were collected from multiple hospitals biennially between 2002 and 2012. Susceptibilities to different antibiotics were determined by broth microdilution. Molecular studies of levofloxacin-resistant isolates included serotyping, PFGE, mutations in the QRDRs and MLST. Results: A total of 1559 isolates were tested and all remained susceptible to penicillin, cephalosporins, meropenem and vancomycin. However, levofloxacin resistance increased from 2.2% (range 0%-3.3%) in 2002-06 to 6.2% (5.9%-7.5%) in 2008-12 (P = 0.016). Among the 88 levofloxacin-resistant isolates, the majority (79.5%) had the GyrA(S81L)+ParC(S79F/Y) double mutations and most (54.5%) were also resistant to clindamycin, erythromycin and tetracycline. The predominant genotype of the levofloxacin-resistant isolates was ST19/serotype III (43.2%). Four previously unreported genotypes, ST1 and its single-locus variants (ST920 and ST922)/serotype VI (28.4%) and ST1/serotype II (18.2%), were found to have circulated locally. Serotype III isolates were predominately from urine and female genital tract specimens and <65-year-old adult outpatients, while serotype II and VI isolates were mostly from respiratory and urine samples and >65-year-old inpatients. Multivariate analysis revealed that elderly age and respiratory samples were independent factors associated with levofloxacin resistance. Conclusions: Multiclonal emergence and dissemination of levofloxacin-resistant GBS isolates occurred in healthcare and community settings in Taiwan. Continuous molecular-level surveillance is important to detect new epidemic trends.
