AIM OF THE STUDY: Korean red ginseng is one of the best selling dietary supplements and its individual constituents enhance renal function. Acute renal failure (ARF) is a predisposing complication of diabetes mellitus as a result of combination drug therapy. The combination of antibiotic-antidiabetic drugs can entail toxicities and drug interactions because of the antibiotic resistance in patients with severe bacterial infection. Currently, gentamicin-metformin combination therapy is commonly prescribed for treating bacterial infections and diabetes, even though both drugs are mainly excreted via the kidney. Thus, this study was designed to investigate whether a Korean red ginseng extract (KRG) prevents renal impairment and pharmacokinetic changes by metformin in rats with renal failure induced by gentamicin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The in vivo pharmacokinetics and in vitro hepatic/intestinal metabolism of metformin were assessed using control (CON), control with Korean red ginseng extract (KRG-CON), acute renal failure induced by gentamicin (ARF), and ARF with Korean red ginseng (KRG-ARF) rats. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacokinetic changes of metformin did not occur in KRG-ARF rats because KRG reduce the renal accumulation of gentamicin compared to ARF rats. Thus, KRG seemed to prevent acute renal failure induced by gentamicin treatment.
