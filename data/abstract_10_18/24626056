The aims of this study were to establish the incidence of invasive candidiasis (IC) in a Beijing hospital, to identify risk factors associated with IC caused by non-C. albicans Candida (NAC), and to determine risk factors for infection caused by NAC species not susceptible to fluconazole. Clinical data from 141 patients admitted to Beijing Chaoyang Hospital (from 2001-2010) diagnosed with IC were retrospectively analyzed. The incidence of IC increased during the 10-year period, but the proportion due to NAC did not change significantly in that of 141 cases, 55 (39%) were due to NAC and 86 (61%) to C. albicans (CA). The NAC species isolated included C. tropicalis (25 of 141, 18%), C. glabrata (14 of 141, 9.9%), C. parapsilosis (eight of 141, 5.7%), C. krusei (three of 141, 2.1%) and C. lusitaniae (one of 141, 0.71%); other Candida species accounted for four of the 141 cases (2.8%). Twenty-one isolates (38%) of NAC were not susceptible to fluconazole. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) (OR 4.2; 95% CI 3.5-58; P < 0.001) and previous fluconazole therapy (OR 7.7; 95% CI 2.2-27; P = 0.001) were risk factors for invasive NAC candidiasis, whereas patient age >/=65 years (OR 0.37; CI 0.16-0.88; P = 0.025) and invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 0.22; CI 0.069-0.70; P =0.010) were connected with invasive CA candidiasis. Prior fluconazole therapy was a risk factor (P = 0.007) for infections caused by NAC not susceptible to fluconazole. In conclusion, TPN and prior fluconazole therapy are independent risk factors for NAC infection, while prior fluconazole therapy is a risk factor for infection due to NAC not susceptible to fluconazole.
