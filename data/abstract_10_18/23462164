The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of Acinetobacter spp. in bulk tank milk (BTM) samples from different provinces of Korea and to analyze their antimicrobial susceptibility. Altogether, 2,287 BTM samples were investigated. Among them, Acinetobacter spp. were isolated from 176 BTM samples. Out of 176 Acinetobacter spp., 57 isolates were identified as Acinetobacter baumannii. None of the isolates were resistant to cefepime, imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or colistin. Resistance to amikacin, gentamicin, piperacillin, and cefotaxime was 2.3, 7.4, 2.3, and 4.0%, respectively. Acinetobacter spp. were least susceptible to tetracycline (17.6%), followed by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (15.9%), ceftazidime (10.8%), and ampicillin-sulbactam (10.2%). Overall, A. baumannii strains were susceptible to most of the antimicrobial agents tested compared with other Acinetobacter spp. The Acinetobacter isolates showed 17 different patterns of antimicrobial resistance. The most frequent resistance profile observed was ampicillin-sulbactam (n=13), followed by tetracycline (n=9), ceftazidime-tetracycline (n=8), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-tetracycline (n=8). The results of this study confirmed that Acinetobacter, including A. baumannii strains, are present in BTM, which clearly showed the importance of examining BTM not only for foodborne pathogens but also for Acinetobacter spp., which could be of public health concern. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of Acinetobacter spp. in BTM samples from Korea.
