Shigellosis presents with varied clinical features are dictated by the species involved, virulence factors of the strain, and the host immune status. We studied the species, virulence genes, and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of the Shigella strains isolated from 33 children aged less than 12 years, with clinical features of shigellosis. Identification and antibiotic sensitivity of Shigella species were done using disc diffusion and E-test. Multiplex PCR was done for the detection of virulence genes (ipaH, ial, set1A, set1B, sen, and stx) and ESBL genes. Parents of the children were interviewed using structured questionnaire to assess the severity of the disease; 26 (79%) of the isolates were Shigella flexneri. Ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone resistance was seen in 23 (69%) and 3 (9%) Shigella isolates respectively. Two ceftriaxone-resistant strains were found to harbour blaCTX gene and the third blaTEM gene. Virulence gene ipaH was detected in 100% of strains while ial, sen, setlA, and setlB were detected in 85%, 61%, 48%, and 48% respectively.
