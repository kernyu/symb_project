BACKGROUND: Cryptolepine (CPE) is the major indoloquinoline isolated from the popular West African anti-malarial plant, Cryptolepis sanguinolenta. CPE possesses various pharmacological activities with potent anti-malarial activity against both chloroquine (CQ)-resistant and -sensitive strains. The search for safe and novel anti-malarial agents and combinations to delay resistance development to Plasmodium falciparum directed this work aimed at evaluating the anti-malarial interaction and safety of CPE in combination with some artemisinin derivatives. METHODS: The in vitro SYBR Green I, fluorescent-based, drug sensitivity assay using a fixed ratio method was carried out on the CQ-sensitive plasmodial strain 3D7 to develop isobolograms from three CPE-based combinations with some artemisinin derivatives. CPE and artesunate (ART) combinations were also evaluated using the Rane's test in ICR mice infected with Plasmodium berghei NK-65 strains in a fixed ratio combination (1:1) and fractions of their ED50s in order to determine the experimental ED50 (Zexp) of the co-administered compounds. Isobolograms were constructed to compare the Zexp to the Zadd. RESULTS: CPE exhibited promising synergistic interactions in vitro with ART, artemether and dihydroartemisinin. In vivo, CPE combination with ART again showed synergy as the Zexp was 1.02 +/- 0.02, which was significantly less than the Zadd of 8.3 +/- 0.31. The haematological, biochemical, organ/body weight ratio and histopathology indices in the rats treated with CPE at all doses (25, 50, 100 mg kg(-1) po) and in combination with ART (4 mg kg(-1)) showed no significant difference compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: The combination of CPE with the artemisinin derivatives were safe in the rodent model and showed a synergistic anti-malarial activity in vivo and in vitro. This study supports the basis for the selection of CPE as a prospective lead compound as the search for new anti-malarial combinations continues.
