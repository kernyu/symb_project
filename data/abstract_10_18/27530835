Empirical use of linezolid has been advocated in neutropenic febrile patients colonised by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) because of the risk of bloodstream infection (BSI). This study aimed to genetically describe a vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) BSI isolate resistant to linezolid (VRLRE) in a patient previously colonised by VREfm and to determine the incidence of colonisation and infection by VREfm in a bone marrow transplant unit over a 10-year period. Data for VREfm colonisation and infection were evaluated. PCR for the vanA and vanB genes, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and microdilution antimicrobial susceptibility testing (vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid and aminoglycosides) were performed. Three isolates, including the VRLRE, were selected for whole-genome sequencing by Ion Torrent, with E. faecium CP006620-Aus0085 used as a reference. Eighty-seven VREfm were analysed; all were linezolid-susceptible and harboured vanA, except for one blood isolate from a febrile neutropenic patient colonised by VREfm who received linezolid for 12 days and developed a BSI by VRLRE (linezolid MIC>/=8mug/mL). Linezolid resistance was associated with a G2576T mutation in the 23SrRNA gene. PFGE analysis demonstrated that the 87 isolates belonged to four major clusters; however, the VRLRE presented only 50% similarity. Three sequence types (STs) were identified: ST412 (the predominant clone, which was more virulent compared with the other isolates); ST478 (linezolid-susceptible VREfm); and a novel ST named ST987 (VRLRE). SNP analysis showed a higher similarity between linezolid-susceptible VREfm and the predominant clone compared with VRLRE. VRLRE presented a G2576T mutation and belonged to a novel ST (ST987).
