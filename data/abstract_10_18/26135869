In a head-to-head comparison of the MTBDRplus version 2.0 (Hain Lifescience), the Xpert MTB/RIF (Cepheid), and the Anyplex MTB/NTM (Seegene) assays, we demonstrated equal sensitivity (59/61; 96.7%) and specificity (53/54; 98.1%) for detecting rifampin resistance with further analysis of discordances. The Xpert assay does not detect isoniazid resistance while the Anyplex assay showed high false positivity.
