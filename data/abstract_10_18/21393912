Acinetobacter baumannii is considered as an emerging nosocomial pathogen and is renowned for its multi-drug resistance. We report a case of community-acquired pan-resistant A. baumannii caused fulminating septicemia. The treatment failure led to death. The A. baumannii strain isolated from blood, pus, urine and tracheal aspirate was confirmed by 16S r-RNA sequence homology and found positive for metallo-beta-lactamase IMP-1, and was found to be a strong biofilm producer. The isolate was only susceptible (moderately) to colistin.
