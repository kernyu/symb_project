AIMS: To determine the factors associated with the presence of pulmonary tuberculosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and the effect in the development of drug and multi-drug resistance, in a population with tuberculosis from the southeast of Mexico. METHODS: This is a case-control study including 409 individuals, 146 with the binomial tuberculosis-type 2 diabetes mellitus and 263 individuals with tuberculosis. Demographic, epidemiological and outcome variables were collected. Risks were calculated. RESULTS: The factors associated with the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus were age >/=35years, (OR=9.7; CI: 5.2-17.8), previous contact with a person infected with tuberculosis (OR=1.7; CI: 1.1-3.1). Body mass index >/=25 kg/m(2) (OR=2.2; CI: 1.1-4.3), and inherited family history of diabetes (OR=5.4; CI: 3.2-9.2). It was also found that patients with tuberculosis-type 2 diabetes mellitus presented a 4.7-fold (CI: 1.4-11.3) and 3.5-fold (CI: 1.1-11.1) higher risk of developing drug- and multidrug resistance tuberculosis, respectively. By last, individuals with tuberculosis-type 2 diabetes had a 2.3-fold (CI: 1.5-4.1) greater chance of persisting as tuberculosis-positive by the second month of treatment, delaying the resolution of the tuberculosis infection. CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 diabetes exerts a strong influence on the presentation and evolution of tuberculosis within the analyzed population and displays remarkable particularities, necessitating the development of dedicated tuberculosis-diabetes surveillance systems that consider the particular epidemiological characteristics of the population affected.
