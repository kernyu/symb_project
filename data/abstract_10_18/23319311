The success of certain sequence types such as ST131 that produce CTX-M or NDM beta-lactamases, and ST405 that produce CTX-M beta-lactamases, among extraintestinal Escherichia coli (ExPEC) had previously been linked to a combination of antimicrobial resistance and certain virulence factors. The adherence properties of these sequence types to gastro-intestinal epithelial cells had not been investigated. A study was therefore designed to investigate the phylogenetic groups, virulence factors and adherence properties of E. coli sequence types ST101, ST131 and ST405 that produce CTX-M-15 and NDM-1. Our results show that ST131 was positive for phylogenetic group B2, ST101 for B1 and ST404 for D. ST131 had more virulence factors than ST101 or ST405. Interestingly, ST101 adhered more avidly to HEp-2 and Caco-2 cells than did ST131 and ST405. Our study showed that adherence to gastro-intestinal cells did not seem to play an important role in the worldwide epidemiological success of ST131 and ST405. The exact role of ExPEC-associated virulence genes is unknown and it is unlikely that one set of factors determines the virulence properties and epidemiological success of certain sequence types. Future investigations should be undertaken to study the microbiological and ecological factors that make certain sequence types among ExPEC such successful pathogens.
