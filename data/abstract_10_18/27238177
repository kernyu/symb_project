INTRODUCTION: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common monogenetic autosomal recessive disease in the human population. This systemic disease is characterized by changes in multiple organs, mainly in the lung tissue and digestive tract. More than 59% of CF patients become sensitized to fungal spores, mostly Aspergillus fumigatus. 5-15% of CF patients develop allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. The aim of the study was to analyse the occurrence of yeast and filamentous fungi of the respiratory infections in CF patients and evaluation of drug resistance. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 2006 and 2014, mycological evaluation of 42 patients hospitalized at the National Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases was carried out. RESULTS: 217 specimens from pulmonary tract were collected from 42 patients with cystic fibrosis. 205 (68%) strains of yeast and 96 (32%) filamentous fungi strains were cultured. The most common mould strain was A. fumigatus - 22,2% (67 species). All isolates of filamentous fungi were in vitro 100% susceptible to itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole and amphotericin B. CONCLUSIONS: A. fumigatus and C. albicans were the most common etiological agents of fungal respiratory pathogens associated with CF patients. A. fumigatus strains were in vitro 100% susceptible to azole and amphotericin B. Two strains of C. albicans and one strain of C. tropicalis were non-susceptible to azole (fluconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole). Scedosporium apiospermum was resistant to amphotericin B (MIC > 32 mg/l) and susceptible to voriconazole (MIC 0.094 mg/l).
