The rapid mutation of RNA viruses allows for the acquisition of resistance to drugs directly targeting viral proteins. Therefore, a novel approach to the development of antivirals centers on targeting host factors critical to viral replication. A recent report has brought to light the potential for RNA viruses to also develop resistance against compounds targeting crucial host factors, suggesting that a combination of drugs with various targets may be necessary for preventing resistance.
