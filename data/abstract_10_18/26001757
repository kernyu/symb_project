This paper reviews the current literature and information on the combination drug Complera() (rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) that was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in August 2011. PubMed, Cochrane and Embase (2001-2014) were searched for primary and review articles on rilpivirine, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, individually or in combination. Data from drug manufacturer and product label was also used. Clinical trial reports were selected, extracted and analyzed to include relevant and recent ones. Selected English-language trials were limited to those with human subjects and included both safety and efficacy outcomes. Results from two phase 3 randomized double blind trials (ECHO and THRIVE) showed that rilpivirine is non-inferior to efavirenz in suppressing viral load below 50 copies/mL in anti-retroviral therapy (ART) naive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients. In addition, psychiatric disturbances, rash and increase in lipid levels occurred less frequently with rilpivirine when compared to efavirenz. However, virological failure and drug resistance were higher with rilpivirine in patients with baseline viral load >100,000 copies/mL. Rilpivirine showed cross resistance to efavirenz and etravirine. Efavirenz, on the other hand, did not demonstrate cross resistance to rilpivirine and etravirine, leaving the latter drugs as options for use in case of virological failure with efavirenz. Complera() remains an acceptable alternative treatment to Atripla() in ART naive patients who have a pre-ART plasma HIV RNA <100,000 copies/mL and CD4 count >200 cells/mm(3) with non-inferior efficacy and better safety and tolerability.
