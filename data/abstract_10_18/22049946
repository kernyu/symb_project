This study reports on the drug resistance profiles for HIV-infected adults in Jamaica using genotypic methods. The genetic diversity of HIV-1 found in these patients was also determined using phylogenetic analysis. Epidemiological data were documented for each patient, blood was collected by venous puncture, and plasma was separated and stored. Viral RNA was extracted and analyzed for mutations in the viral genome by the amplification of the protease and reverse transcriptase (Pro-RT) regions using a nested PCR method. The rate of drug resistance among treatment-experienced individuals was 35%, while treatment-naive individuals showed a prevalence of 29%. The overall prevalence of drug resistance mutations in Jamaicans was consistent with the increased use of antiretroviral drugs in the region, with many of the mutations detected reducing susceptibility to the drugs commonly used to treat Jamaican patients. These results indicate the need for regular drug resistant surveillance to guide treatment strategies.
