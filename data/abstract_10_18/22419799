OBJECTIVES: To investigate the mechanism of ceftazidime resistance in two isogenic Acinetobacter baumannii strains from the United Arab Emirates. METHODS: Two A. baumannii strains, NM55 and NM128, were isolated 4 months apart from a 6-year-old patient in the United Arab Emirates. Genotypic characterization was performed by PFGE and the MIC of ceftazidime was determined by the agar dilution method. Detection of bla(OXA) and metallo-beta-lactamase genes was performed by multiplex PCR. Analysis of bla(PER-7), ISAba1, bla(ADC) and the ISCR1 element was carried out by standard PCR. Plasmid analysis was achieved by Southern blotting. RESULTS: Strain NM55 was resistant to ceftazidime, whereas strain NM128 was susceptible. Both isolates carried the bla(OXA-23) and bla(OXA-64) genes and were identical according to their PFGE patterns. ISAba1 was present upstream of the bla(OXA-23) gene, but absent upstream of bla(ADC-26), in both strains. Strain NM55 possessed a bla(PER-7) gene with the presence of gst, a fragment of the abc transporter and a transposase gene downstream of it. The entire structure was part of an ISCR1 element and was located on an approximately 200 kb plasmid in strain NM55, while the ceftazidime-susceptible NM128 strain carried an approximately 180 kb plasmid without the bla(PER-7) gene. CONCLUSIONS: Ceftazidime resistance was mediated by a PER-7 beta-lactamase encoded in an ISCR1 element located on a plasmid. This represents the first detection of a PER-7 beta-lactamase encoded by a plasmid in A. baumannii.
