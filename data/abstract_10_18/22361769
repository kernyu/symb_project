Carbapenem resistance among clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, especially Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, is largely conferred by metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL). Fifty-one non repetitive isolates of carbapenem-resistant (Meropenem and Imipenem) E. coli and K. pneumoniae were studied to determine the molecular mechanism for resistance. Presence of blaNDM and blaVIM was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing. blaNDM was detected from majority of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (75%) and E. coli (66.6%). Timely detection and appropriate and aggressive infection control measures are required to control the spread of these bacteria in healthcare settings.
