Fludarabine (Flu), clofarabine (Clo) and busulfan (Bu) are used in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT). We reported that combining [Flu + Clo + Bu] had a synergistic cytotoxicity in AML cells. We hypothesized that combining [Flu + Clo + Bu] with the histone deacetylase inhibitor SAHA will further enhance cytotoxicity. We exposed the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines KBM3/Bu250(6) and OCI-AML3 to Flu, Clo, Bu and SAHA alone and in various combinations. [Flu + Clo + Bu + SAHA] resulted in synergistic cytotoxicity, which can be attributed to (1) activated DNA-damage response and cell cycle checkpoint activation through the ATM-CHK2-P53 (or P73) pathway or ATM-CHK2-cdc25-cdc2 pathway, (2) histone modifications and (3) activated apoptosis pathway. The [Flu + Clo + Bu + SAHA] combination causes mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, leakage of cytochrome c and Smac/Diablo into the cytosol with caspase activation, and release of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) into the nucleus resulting in nuclear fragmentation and cell death. These results provide a mechanistic basis for using SAHA in future clinical trials with double nucleoside analog-busulfan combinations in pretransplant conditioning therapy.
