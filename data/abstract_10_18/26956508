BACKGROUND: Tigecycline (TIG) is an antibiotic belonging to the glycylcyclines class and appears to be a good choice to fight infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus. To date, TIG exhibits good activity against this microorganism. The aim of this work was to obtain in vitro mutants of S. aureus resistant to TIG and evaluate possible changes in their susceptibility patterns to other antibiotics. RESULTS: Two mutants of S. aureus resistant to TIG (MIC = 16 microg/mL) were selected in vitro from clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus. In both mutants, corresponding to different lineage (ST5 and ST239), an increase of efflux activity against TIG was detected. One mutant also showed a reduced susceptibility to vancomycin, corresponding to the VISA phenotype (MIC = 4 microg/mL), with a loss of functionality of the agr locus. The emergence of the VISA phenotype was accompanied by an increase in oxacillin and cefoxitin MICs. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that, under selective pressure, the increase of efflux activity in S. aureus is one of the mechanisms that may be involved in the emergence of tigecycline resistance. The emergence of this phenotype may eventually be associated to changes in susceptibility to other antibiotics such oxacillin and vancomycin.
