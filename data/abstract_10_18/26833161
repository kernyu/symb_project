The population structure of 71 carbapenem-resistantAcinetobacter baumanniiclinical isolates from several hospitals in Brazil was investigated by ApaI pulsed-field gel electrophoresis,blaOXA-51-like subtyping, and multilocus sequence typing (Institute Pasteur scheme). In addition to the predominance of strains carryingblaOXA-23, we detected the presence ofblaOXA-72andblaOXA-231 We observed a predominance of clonal complex 1 (CC1), CC15, and CC79 and representative strains of the worldwide-disseminated international clone I.
