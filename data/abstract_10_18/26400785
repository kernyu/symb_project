Mycoplasma pneumoniae-positive clinical specimens obtained from the United States and China during the same period were studied for their molecular characteristics. We found much more diverse genotypes and a lower prevalence of macrolide resistance in the U.S. specimens. Data from the study also showed an association of the resistance with certain genotypes.
