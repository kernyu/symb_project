A 5-year survey from 2005 to 2009 revealed an increasing trend of resistance to nalidixic acid (from 0% in 2005 to 11% in 2009) among 858 clinical isolates of Salmonella Typhimurium. In addition, 10 ceftriaxone-resistant and 3 ciprofloxacin-resistant Salmonella Typhimurium isolates were detected over the period of study.
