The authors report Myxobacteria virescens (M. virescens) mediated synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and its efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC-33591), Salmonella typhi (ATCC-51812), Escherichia coli (E. coli) (ATCC-14948), Klebsiella pneumoniae (MTCC-4030) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MTCC-4673). The organism exhibiting resistance to various antibiotics showed remarkable sensitivity, when used in combination of antibiotics and AgNPs. Antimicrobial property of AgNPs is playing a significant role in medicine and food storage. In this study, they have used M. virescens for the synthesis of AgNPs, which were characterised by using UV-Vis spectrophotometer, nano-particles tracking and analysis, zeta potential, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Synthesised AgNPs were impregnated into paper by three different methods, i.e. glass rod method (without binder), glass rod method (with binder) and direct synthesis of AgNPs on paper. Nanoparticles synthesis on paper showed the significant antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC-33591), Salmonella typhi (ATCC-51812), E. coli (ATCC-14948), Klebsiella pneumoniae (MTCC-4030) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MTCC-4673). Paper impregnated with AgNPs was used for wrapping of fruits (apples) which increases their shelf life up to 15 days. This study demonstrates a new method for wrapping of fruits, which increases the shelf life of apples.
