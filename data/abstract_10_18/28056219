The Miranda Donkey (Equus asinus) is an endangered asinine from Miranda do Douro region, located in North East of Portugal. We study the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and virulence genes in Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp. isolates from these animals. In March 2014, a total of 66 faecal samples were recovered from independent animals. Antibiotic resistance was determined by the disk diffusion method. Carriage of genes codifying for antibiotic resistant and virulent factors was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A total of 66 E. coli and 41 enterococci isolates were detected, being the most prevalent species Enterococcus faecium (61%) and Enterococcus hirae (24%). For enterococcal isolates, high percentages of resistant rates to tetracycline (68.3%), quinupristin/dalfopristin (51.2%) and ciprofloxacin (48.8%) were observed. The erm(A) and/or erm(B), tet(M) and/or tet(L), vat(D) and/or vat(E) and aph(3')-IIIa genes were also found. The most frequent virulence gene detected was gel(E), followed by ace, cpd and hyl. E. coli isolates were highly resistant to streptomycin (78%), whereas 39% of them exhibited resistance to aminoglycosides and tetracycline. sul1 and/or sul2 genes were detected in 66.7% of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistant isolates. The virulence genes detected were fim(A) (46%) and cnf1 (27%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing antibiotic resistance among E. coli and Enterococcus spp. Isolates from Miranda Donkey in Portugal, pointed out as possible antibiotic-resistant bacteria reservoirs. Although the detection of these resistances they present low risk for other animals as well as for human being, in that rural area context.
