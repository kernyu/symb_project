Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been implicated in a broad range of infections and shown to acquire rapid resistance to anti-microbial agents. In the present, study we have used particular amalgamation of specific lipids that hold innate antibacterial activities, which can be transformed into cationized and non-cationized nanoemulsions. The anti-Pseudomonas activities were then elucidated by transmission/scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. The microscopic studies revealed the cell lysis due to the formation of blebs, exudation of essential cellular contents and loss of characteristics contour of the cells. The microscopic studies were then corroborated by zone of inhibition, cytoplasmic release studies, time dependent killing and MIC determination. Conclusively, it can be inferred that the delivery issues of antibiotics could be reassessed by using certain excipients that possess inherent antibacterial properties. This will not only avoid unnecessary introduction of inactive excipients in the body, but will also reduce the dose of antibiotics because of synergistic effects of excipients and drug acting together.
