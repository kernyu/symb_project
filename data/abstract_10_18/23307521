Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) are an effective strategy for improving the quality and safety of antimicrobial prescribing for hospitalized patients. Pediatric ASPs are in their early stages of development, and there are unique issues relevant to children. The imperative to ensure that antimicrobials are prescribed judiciously is highlighted by the ongoing epidemic increase in antimicrobial-resistant infections and the simultaneous decline in the rate of new drug development. In this review we describe the process of ASP development for pediatrics, review existing data regarding the impact of pediatric ASPs, and describe the priorities and challenges for ASP research including study design and appropriate end points.
