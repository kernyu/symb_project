BACKGROUND: Aberrant epigenetic histone modifications are implicated in cancer pathobiology, therefore histone modifying enzymes are emerging targets for anti-cancer therapy. There is a few evidence for deregulation of the histone modifying enzymes in glioblastomas. Glioma treatment is a clinical challenge due to its resistance to current therapies. METHODS: The effect of selected inhibitors on epigenetic modifications and viability of glioma C6 cells were studied using immunofluorescence and MTT metabolism test. RESULTS: We found that VPA and TSA increase histone H4 acetylation in glioma cells, while chaetocin and BIX01294 at low concentrations reduce H3K9me3, and 3DZNep decreases H3K27me3. Long-term treatment with some epigenetic inhibitors affects viability of glioma cells. CONCLUSIONS: We established the concentrations of selected inhibitors which in C6 glioma cells inhibit the enzyme activity, but do not decrease cell viability, hence allow to study the role of histone modifications in C6 glioma biology.
