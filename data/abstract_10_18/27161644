Metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) confer resistance to carbapenems, and their increasing global prevalence is a growing clinical concern. To elucidate the mechanisms by which these enzymes recognize and hydrolyze carbapenems, we solved 1.4 to 1.6 A crystal structures of SMB-1 (Serratia metallo-beta-lactamase 1), a subclass B3 MBL, bound to hydrolyzed carbapenems (doripenem, meropenem, and imipenem). In these structures, SMB-1 interacts mainly with the carbapenem core structure via elements in the active site, including a zinc ion (Zn-2), Q157[113] (where the position in the SMB-1 sequence is in brackets after the BBL number), S221[175], and T223[177]. There is less contact with the carbapenem R2 side chains, strongly indicating that SMB-1 primarily recognizes the carbapenem core structure. This is the first report describing how a subclass B3 MBL recognizes carbapenems. We also solved the crystal structure of SMB-1 in complex with the approved drugs captopril, an inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme, and 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate, a chemoprotectant. These drugs are inhibitors of SMB-1 with Ki values of 8.9 and 184 muM, respectively. Like carbapenems, these inhibitors interact with Q157[113] and T223[177] and their thiol groups coordinate the zinc ions in the active site. Taken together, the data indicate that Q157[113], S221[175], T223[177], and the two zinc ions in the active site are key targets in the design of SMB-1 inhibitors with enhanced affinity. The structural data provide a solid foundation for the development of effective inhibitors that would overcome the carbapenem resistance of MBL-producing multidrug-resistant microbes.
