BACKGROUND: Chagas' disease is caused by the haemophlagelated protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi). During congenital transmission the parasite breaks down the placental barrier. In the present study we analyzed the participation of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) in the extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling during T. cruzi ex vivo infection of human placental chorionic villi explants. METHODS: Chorionic villi from healthy woman placentas were incubated in the presence or absence of 10(5) or 10(6) T. cruzi trypomastigotes (Y strain) with or without the MMPs inhibitor doxycycline. Effective infection was tested measuring parasite DNA by real time PCR (qPCR). MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression were determined by western blotting and immunohistochemistry and their activities were measured by zymography. The effect of MMPs on ECM structure was analyzed histochemically. RESULTS: T. cruzi induces the expression and activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in chorionic villi. Inhibition of the MMPs prevents the tissue damage induced by T. cruzi and partially decreases the ex vivo infection of the chorionic villi. CONCLUSION: MMPs are partially responsible for the ECM changes observed in human chorionic villi during T. cruzi infection and participate in tissue invasion. On the other hand, MMPs may be part of a local placental antiparasitic mechanism.
