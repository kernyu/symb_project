There are no clinically useful inhibitors of metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs), which are a growing problem because they hydrolyse almost all beta-lactam antibacterials. Inhibition by most reported MBL inhibitors involves zinc ion chelation. A structure-based virtual screening approach combined with NMR filtering led to the identification of inhibitors of the clinically relevant Verona Integron-encoded MBL (VIM)-2. Crystallographic analyses reveal a new mode of MBL inhibition involving binding adjacent to the active site zinc ions, but which does not involve metal chelation. The results will aid efforts to develop new types of clinically useful inhibitors targeting MBLs/MBL-fold metallo-enzymes involved in antibacterial and anticancer drug resistance.
