Aminoglycosides are key drugs for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. A total of 97 extensively drug-resistant (XDR) and 29 pan-susceptible Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from Korean tuberculosis patients were analyzed to characterize mutations within the rrs, rpsL, gidB, eis and tlyA genes. Thirty (56.6 %) of the 53 streptomycin (STR)-resistant strains had a rpsL mutation and eight strains (15.1 %) had a rrs (514 or 908 site) mutation, whereas 11 (20.8 %) of the 53 STR-resistant strains had a gidB mutation without rpsL or either rrs mutation. Most of the gidB mutations conferred low-level STR resistance, and 22 of these mutations were novel. Mutation at position 1401 in rrs lead to resistance to kanamycin (80/95 = 84.2 %; KAN), amikacin (80/87 = 92.0 %; AMK), and capreomycin (74/86 = 86.0 %; CAP). In this study, 13.7 % (13/95) of KAN-resistant strains showed eis mutations, including 4 kinds of novel mutations. Isolates with eis structural gene mutations were cross-resistant to STR, KAN, CAP, and AMK. Here, 5.8 % (5/86) of the CAP-resistant strains harbored a tlyA mutation that included 3 different novel point mutations. Detection of the A1401G mutation appeared to be 100 % specific for the detection of resistance to KAN and AMK. These data establish the presence of phenotypic XDR strains using molecular profiling and are helpful to understanding of aminoglycoside resistance at the molecular level.
