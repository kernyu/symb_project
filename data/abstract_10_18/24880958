In this study we characterised the ciprofloxacin-resistant strains isolated in biofilm and sediments from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) discharge point and its receiving river. We also examined the prevalence of qnrA, qnrB, qnrS and aac(6')-Ib-cr genes in these isolates and determined whether they harbour plasmid-encoded beta-lactamases such as TEM, SHV and CTX-M. Moreover, antibiotic concentrations were also measured to evaluate the level of contamination of these pharmaceuticals in the sampling area. Antibiotics were found in the range of ng L(-1) in WWTP effluents, but most of them were no longer found in downstream river. However, some fluoroquinolones were detected in sediment downstream demonstrating their high persistence and their capacity to be retained in the river sediments. Most of the ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates belonged to the Gammaproteobacteria class and 17 of them, 8 (7.6%) from the first sampling and 9 (6.1%) from the second sampling, carried a qnr gene. In particular, 15 isolates carried the qnrS gene and 2 carried the qnrB gene. Among the qnr-positive isolates, 12 harboured the aac(6')-lb-cr gene and 2 of them also carried a beta-lactamase on the same plasmid, indicating that they may be transferred simultaneously. It is also noteworthy that all qnr-positive isolates identified as Aeromonas species harboured the same qnrS allele, namely the qnrS2. This study reinforces the importance of environmental bacteria as vehicles for dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes.
