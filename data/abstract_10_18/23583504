Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Acinetobacter baumannii are both non-fermenting ubiquitous Gram-negative bacilli. The incidence of lower respiratory tract infections related to these microorganisms is increasing, especially in intensive care units. Their capacity to acquire resistance against several antimicrobials is challenging for clinicians and microbiologists. Despite their low virulence, these pathogens are responsible for colonization and infection in patients with comorbidities, immunosuppression, and critically ill patients. S. maltophilia and A. baumannii are mainly identified in nosocomial infections: ventilator-associated pneumonia, bacteremia and surgical wound infection. Infections related to these microorganism are associated with high mortality and morbidity. Trimethoprime-sulfamethoxazole and carbapenem are the first line treatment for infections related to S. maltophilia and A. baumannii respectively. However, the increasing rate of resistance against these agents results in difficulties in treating patients with infections related to these pathogens. New antimicrobial agents and further randomized studies are needed to improve the treatment of these infections. Prevention of spared of these multidrug-resistant bacteria is mandatory, including hand-hygiene, environment cleaning, and limited usage of large spectrum antibiotics.
