In cancer therapy, enhanced thymidine uptake by the salvage pathway can bypass dTMP depletion, thereby conferring resistance to thymidylate synthase inhibition. We investigated whether sequential combination therapy of capecitabine and trifluridine/tipiracil (TAS-102) could synergistically enhance antitumor efficacy in colon cancer xenograft models. We also examined 3'-deoxy-3'-[(18)F]fluorothymidine ([(18)F]FLT) PET as a means to predict therapeutic response to a sequential combination of capecitabine and trifluridine/tipiracil. [(3)H]FLT uptake after 5-fluorouracil treatment in vitro and [(18)F]FLT uptake after capecitabine (360 mg/kg/day) in athymic nude mice (Balb/c-nu) with xenografts (n = 10-12 per group) were measured using eight human colon cancer cell lines. We determined the synergistic effects of sequential combinations of 5-fluorouracil and trifluridine in vitro as well as the sequential combination of oral capecitabine (30-360 mg/kg) and trifluridine/tipiracil (trifluridine 75 or 150 mg/kg with tipiracil) in six xenograft models (n = 6-10 per group). We observed significant increases in [(3)H]FLT uptake in all cell lines and [(18)F]FLT uptake in five xenograft models after 5-fluorouracil and capecitabine treatment, respectively. Increased [(18)F]FLT uptake after capecitabine followed by extinction of uptake correlated strongly with tumor growth inhibition (rho = -0.81, P = 0.02). The effects of these combinations were synergistic in vitro A synergy for sequential capecitabine and trifluridine/tipiracil was found only in mouse xenograft models showing increased [(18)F]FLT uptake after capecitabine. Our results suggest that the sequential combination of capecitabine and trifluridine/tipiracil is synergistic in tumors with an activated salvage pathway after capecitabine treatment in mice, and [(18)F]FLT PET imaging may predict the response to capecitabine and the synergistic antitumor efficacy of a sequential combination of capecitabine and trifluridine/tipiracil.
