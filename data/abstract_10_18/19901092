Five different strains of bacteria belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae were isolated from two patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit of the Central Military Hospital of Algiers, Algeria. All five strains, one Providencia stuartii strain, two Escherichia coli strains, and two Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, were intermediate or resistant to all beta-lactams, including carbapenems. Synergy between imipenem and EDTA was observed for all five strains. The results of the PCR experiment confirmed the presence of a bla(VIM) gene in all five strains. The bla(VIM) genes were located as part of a class 1 integron on a 180-kb conjugative plasmid. They encoded a novel metallo-beta-lactamase designated VIM-19, which differed from the parental enzyme VIM-1 by only two substitutions: Ser228Arg, previously observed in the closely related enzyme VIM-4, and Asn215Lys, not previously observed in other VIM-type carbapenemases. VIM-19 was further characterized after purification through determination of its kinetic constants. This enzyme was inhibited by EDTA and hydrolyzed penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems, as observed for other VIM-type carbapenemases but with greater catalytic efficiency against penicillins than VIM-1. VIM-19 is the first carbapenemase enzyme identified from an isolate from Algeria. These results confirm the emergence of VIM-4-like enzymes in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae from Mediterranean countries.
