Platinum-based chemotherapy is a primary treatment for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Considering individual differences, an effective and convenient method is urgently needed to identify the sensitivity of individual patient to platinum based regimen. Genetic variants in DNA repair genes are presumed to represent important determinants of drug efficacy. Our previous studies have demonstrated the involvement of xeroderma pigmentosum group A (XPA) codon23 and xeroderma pigmentosum group D (XPD) codon751 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in clinical response to platinum based chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC patients. Thus, a follow-up study was carried out to investigate the relevance of these genotypes and survival of the cohort (n = 115). The three-dimensional (3-D), polyacrylamide gel-based DNA microarray method was used to assess the genotypes of XPA and XPD in peripheral lymphocytes. Log-rank test revealed that the variant genotypes of XPA23 (A/G+G/G) were associated with significantly longer progression- free survival (PFS) (6.0 m vs. 10.6 m, log-rank P = 0.001) and overall survival (OS) (11.2 m vs. 20.8 m, log-rank P = 0.001). In Cox proportional hazards model, the hazard ratio (HR) for death in patients with G allele was 0.65 (P = 0.049). While no significant differences were observed in PFS or OS according to XPD Lys751Gln genotypes (log-rank P > 0.05). In combination with our previous short-term clinical results, this study further confirmed that by detecting the SNPs in blood cells, XPA A23G polymorphic variants might be a promising biomarker in predicting a favor prognosis of NSCLC patients and be helpful towards designing individualized treatments.
