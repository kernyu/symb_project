The objective of this study was to analyse the distribution and antimicrobial resistance of bacterial uropathogens isolated from outpatients at Henan Provincial People's Hospital. A total of 1419 samples from 823 newly diagnosed and 596 recurrent UTI outpatients culture positive. Escherichia coli was the most common uropathogen. Compared with the recurrent group, the newly diagnosed group had a higher isolation rate of E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae but a lower isolation rate of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. Except for P. aeruginosa, the resistance of Gram-negative bacteria to most antibiotics was less than 30%. All Enterococcus and Staphylococcus spp. were sensitive to linezolid, vancomycin and teicoplanin. Both Gram-negative and -positive bacteria exhibited high susceptibility to fosfomycin. Uropathogens isolated from recurrent outpatients had higher resistance rates than did those isolated from newly diagnosed outpatients. Our study indicated that fosfomycin might be an excellent treatment option for outpatients with UTIs.
