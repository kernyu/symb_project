BACKGROUND: Furazolidone is a much cheaper drug with a very low resistance against Helicobacter pylori compared to clarithromycin. We aim to evaluate safety and efficacy of a sequential furazolidone-based regimen versus clarithromycin-based therapy in H. pylori eradication for ulcer disease. MATERIALS: Patients with proven peptic ulcer or duodenitis were randomized into three groups: OAB-M-F; metronidazole (M) (500 mg bid) for the first 5 days, followed by furazolidone (F) (200 mg bid) for the second 5 days; OAC-P; clarithromycin (C) (500 mg bid) for 10 days; and OAB-C-F; clarithromycin (500 mg bid) for the first 5 days and furazolidone (200 mg bid) for the second 5 days. All groups received omeprazole (O) (20 mg bid) and amoxicillin (A) (1 g bid). Groups OAB-M-F and OAB-C-F were also given bismuth subcitrate (B) (240 mg bid), whereas a placebo (P) was given to group OAC-P. Adverse events were scored and recorded. Two months after treatment, a C(13) -urea breath test was performed. RESULTS: Three hundred and ten patients were enrolled and 92 (OAB-M-F), 95 (OAC-P), and 98 (OAB-C-F) completed the study. The intention-to-treat eradication rates were 78.5% (95% CI = 69-85), 81.1% (95% CI = 73-88), and 82% (95% CI = 74-89), and per-protocol eradication rates were 91.3% (95% CI = 83-96), 90.4% (95% CI = 82-95), and 88.7% (95% CI = 81-94), for group OAB-M-F, OAC-P, and OAB-C-F, respectively. Eradication rate differences did not reach statistical significance. The most common adverse event, bad taste, occurred in all groups, but more frequently in groups OAC-P (34%) and OAB-C-F (32%), than OAB-M-F (14%) (p < .05). Adverse symptoms score were 0.88 +/- 2.05 in group OAB-M-F, 1.15 +/- 1.40 in group OAC-P, and 1.87 +/- 1.62 in group OAB-C-F. CONCLUSION: Furazolidone can replace clarithromycin in H. pylori eradication regimens because of lack of development of resistance and very low cost.
