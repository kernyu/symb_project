The benefit of endocrine therapy has always been limited by the eventual development of acquired resistance. For the first time, clinical research has identified a therapeutic agent, everolimus, that targets the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which in combination with the aromatase inhibitor exemestane can substantially reduce the risk of disease progression and seemingly circumvent endocrine resistance. The magnitude of the benefit represents a quantum shift in how we should use endocrine therapy in future, and potentially defines a new standard of care in this setting.
