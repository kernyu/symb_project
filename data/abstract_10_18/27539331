The purpose of this study was to determine prevalence and molecular characterization of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes [qnrA, qnrB, qnrC, qnrD, qnrS, aac(6')-Ib-cr, qepA, and oqxAB] among extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. isolates from bloodcultures in Hungary. A total of 103 isolates were tested for quinolone susceptibility by microdilution method and PMQR genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction. About 40 ESBL-producing E. coli (39%) and 50 ESBL-producing Klebsiella spp. strains (48%) were resistant to ciprofloxacin; 40 ESBL-producing E. coli (39%) and 47 ESBL-producing Klebsiella spp. strains (45%) were resistant to levofloxacin; and 88 strains including 40 ESBL-producing E. coli (39%) and 48 (47%) ESBL-producing Klebsiella spp. were resistant to moxifloxacin. Among the 103 ESBL-producing isolates, 77 (75%) isolates (30 E. coli and 47 Klebsiella spp.) harbored PMQR genes. The most commonly detected gene was aac(6')-Ib-cr (65%). The occurrence of qnrS gene was 6%. Interestingly, qnrA, qnrB, qnrC, qnrD, and qepA were not found in any isolates. Among 77 PMQR-positive isolates, 27 (35.1%) and 1 (1.3%) carried two and three different PMQR genes, respectively. Only Klebsiella spp. harbored more than one PMQR genes. Observing prevalence of PMQR genes in the last 8 years, the increasing incidence of aac(6')-Ib-cr and oqxAB can be seen. Our results highlight high frequency of PMQR genes among ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and E. coli isolates with an increasing dynamics in Hungary.
