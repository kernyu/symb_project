OBJECTIVE: To determine current outcomes and predictors of treatment failure among patients with surgical site infection (SSI) after colorectal surgery. METHODS: A multicentre observational prospective cohort study of adults undergoing elective colorectal surgery in 10 Spanish hospitals (2011-2014). Treatment failure was defined as persistence of signs/symptoms of SSI or death at 30 days post-surgery. RESULTS: Of 3701 patients, 669 (18.1%) developed SSI; 336 (9.1%) were organ-space infections. Among patients with organ-space SSI, 81.2% required source control: 60.4% reoperation and 20.8% percutaneous/transrectal drainage. Overall treatment failure rate was 21.7%: 9% in incisional SSIs and 34.2% in organ-space SSIs (p < 0.001). Median length of stay was 15 days (IQR 9-22) for incisional SSIs and 24 days (IQR 17-35) for organ-space SSIs (p < 0.001). One hundred and twenty-seven patients (19%) required readmission and 35 patients died (5.2%). Risk factors for treatment failure among patients with organ-space SSI were age >/=65 years (OR 1.83, 95% CI: 1.07-1.83), laparoscopy (OR 1.7, 95% CI: 1.06-2.77), and reoperation (OR 2.8, 95% CI: 1.7-4.6). CONCLUSIONS: Rates of SSI and treatment failure in organ-space SSI after elective colorectal surgery are notably high. Careful attention should be paid to older patients with previous laparoscopy requiring reoperation for organ-space SSI, so that treatment failure can be identified early.
