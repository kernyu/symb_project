Interleukin-23 (IL-23) and its downstream factor IL-17 are the key cytokines involved in immune and inflammatory response in chronic liver diseases. This study aimed to investigate the role and molecular mechanisms of the IL-23/Th17 axis in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and the efficacy of IL-23/Th17 modulation in response to anti-HCV therapy. Sixty-six HCV-infected patients and 20 healthy controls were enrolled. The patients received PegIFNa-2a and ribavirin therapy for at least 48 weeks. The plasma level of IL-23 and the number of IL-17A-, IFN-gamma-, and IL-21-producing peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) at baseline and 12, 24, and 48 weeks following treatment were determined. The mRNA level of Th17 immune-associated molecules in PBMCs was evaluated by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) following treatment with IL-23 agonist or antagonist. Our data showed that, compared to healthy controls, HCV-infected patients had an increased plasma level of IL-23 and increased frequencies of IL-17A- and IFN-gamma-producing PBMCs, whereas the HCV patients exhibited a reduced number of IL-21-producing PBMCs. However, the baseline frequencies of IL-21-producing PBMCs were markedly higher in HCV patients who achieved rapid virological response (RVR) than those without RVR. Additionally, the mRNA expressions of IL-21, IFN-gamma, myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA), and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) were significantly upregulated in PBMCs, while FoxP3 expression was suppressed by IL-23 agonist. Thus, the IL-23/Th17 axis plays an important role in development of chronic HCV infection and antiviral response. IL-23 may enhance the antiviral activity of interferon-based therapy by modulating the expression of Th17 cells-associated molecules in HCV-infected patients.
