To estimate the prevalence of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR TB) in China, we retrospectively analyzed drug-resistance profiles of 989 clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates. We found 319 (32.3%) isolates resistant to >/=1 first-line drugs; 107 (10.8%) isolates were multidrug resistant, of which 20 (18.7%) were XDR. XDR TB is of major concern in China.
