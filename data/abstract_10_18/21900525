From March 2009 to May 2009, 24 carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were recovered from 16 patients hospitalized in an Italian intensive care unit (ICU). All isolates contained KPC-3 carbapenemase and belonged to a single pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) clone of multilocus sequence type 258 (designated as ST258). A multimodal infection control program was put into effect, and the spread of the KPC-3-producing K. pneumoniae clone was ultimately controlled without closing the ICU to new admissions. Reinforced infection control measures and strict monitoring of the staff adherence were necessary for the control of the outbreak.
