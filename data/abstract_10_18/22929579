The incidence of nosocomial fungal infections has increased over the past 20 years. Candida albicans is the most commonly involved pathogen. Concurrently, the number of non-albicans species with decreased susceptibility to commonly used antifungal agents has increased significantly. Invasive candidiasis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We present a case of unusually massive infection with a number of different Candida species, which caused severe prolonged infection in a critically ill patient.
