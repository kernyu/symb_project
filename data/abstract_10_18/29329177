Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays to detect antimicrobial resistance-associated mutations were tested on Neisseria gonorrhoeae-positive clinical samples with matched isolates. Of the nucleic acid amplification tests/cultures, 87.7% (64/73), 98.6% (72/73), and 98.4% (62/63) predicted cephalosporin, ciprofloxacin, and azithromycin susceptibilities, respectively. N. gonorrhoeae multiantigen sequence type was correctly predicted for 98.7% (79/80), and 13 of 58 N. gonorrhoeae-negative specimens showed false-positive results.
