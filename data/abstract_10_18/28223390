aac(6')-Ib-cr is a plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance gene embedded within a gene cassette, most often within an integron. It confers resistance to quinolones and aminoglycosides. We investigated the role of a 101-bp fragment frequently present upstream of the aac(6')-Ib-cr gene cassette and found that it contributes to the expression of aac(6')-Ib-cr and provides an alternative start codon, confirming the length of the AAC(6')-Ib-cr protein to 199 amino acids.
