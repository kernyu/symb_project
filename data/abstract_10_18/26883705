Resistance to carbapenems in Enterobacteriaceae is a clinical problem of growing significance. Difficulty in treating multidrug-resistant Gram-negative organisms with conventional antibiotics has led to a renewed and increasing use of polymyxin compounds, such as colistin. Here, we report the isolation of carbapenem- and colistin-resistant Enterobacter cloacae from a polymicrobial lower extremity wound in an ambulatory patient. Whole-genome sequencing demonstrated the presence of chromosomal blaIMI-1 and blaAmpC, as well as numerous efflux pump genes.
