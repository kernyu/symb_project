Subsequent studies have implicated the hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein in the pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis. Chronic HCV infection may also cause steatosis by impairing fatty acid oxidation. There is relationship between accumulation of fat into the liver and overweight and/or obesity. Another unexpected virus-host interaction is the HCV infection and diabetes. HCV encoded proteins might alter insulin signaling thus explaining impaired insulin sensitivity and the occurrence of glycaemic dysregulation. Some pieces of the puzzle are still not well known; e.g. the factors and the spectrum of disorders associated with insulin resistance, and whether the liver is a trigger or target of metabolic syndrome? In this review article clinical consequence of chronic HCV infection, diabetes mellitus and hepatic steatosis are discussed, as well as their possible effects on antiviral therapy.
