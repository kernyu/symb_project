We report a case of Mycobacterium kansasii presenting as an obstructing endobronchial mass in a patient post stem cell transplant. The patient had a complete clinical, microbiological, and radiological response to anti-tuberculous treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first case of M. kansasii presenting post transplant with an obstructing lung mass simulating relapse or post-transplant lymphoma.
