Aeromonas hydrophila is a Gram-negative bacterium of considerable importance in both clinical, especially nosocomial infections, and zoonotic respects, both aquatic and terrestrial infections. In addition to the ability to thrive in a wide range of conditions, A. hydrophila is resistant to numerous antibiotics and antimicrobials. In conjunction with Kansas State University and the Kansas Water Office, water samples from various locations within Kansas were screened for organisms resistant to chlorhexidine. Chlorhexidine is the active agent in many surgical scrubs, prescription mouthwashes, and other bactericidal and bacteriostatic substances. Aeromonas hydrophila capable of growth in therapeutic levels of chlorhexidine was detected in one of the water samples. The isolate was determined not to be harboring a plasmid, lending to a course of inquiry founded on the premise that the source of chlorhexidine resistance resides within the chromosome. Investigation into efflux pumps (EP) is underway with select resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) pumps, especially the AheABC EP, being exculpated of responsibility for chlorhexidine resistance following testing with a select EP inhibitor. Inquiry into the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) EPs is underway with specific examination of the EmrB/QacA EPs, as chlorhexidine resistance in Staphylococcus aureus carrying the QacA gene has been observed.
