OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical characteristics and therapeutic outcomes of patients with hematogenous vertebral osteomyelitis (HVO) caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). METHODS: We performed a cohort study of adult patients diagnosed with S. aureus HVO at a tertiary-care hospital over a 7-year period. RESULTS: Of the 139 patients with S. aureus HVO, MRSA caused 62 (44.6%) cases. In multivariate analysis, compared with methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), MRSA was associated with a higher risk of persistent bacteremia (>/=7 days) (8.40 fold; P < 0.001) and relapse (4.83 fold; P = 0.03), and increased hospital stay (1.69 fold; P = 0.001). Among the MRSA cases, relapse rates differed according to duration of antibiotics: 41.7% (4-6 weeks), 25.0% (6-8 weeks), and 5.6% (>/=8 weeks) (P = 0.007). Bacteremia was more likely to persist for >/=7 days in patients with an initial vancomycin trough <15 mg/L than in those with an initial trough >/=15 mg/L (79.3% vs. 20.0%; P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: MRSA HVO was associated with more frequent persistent bacteremia (>/=7 days) and relapse, and longer hospital stay compared to MSSA HVO. Antibiotic therapy for >/=8 weeks and targeting a vancomycin trough of >/=15 mg/L may be benefit patients with MRSA HVO.
