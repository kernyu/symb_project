The emergence of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis calls for novel approaches to treatment. Recent studies have shown that BlaC, the beta-lactamase of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is the major determinant of beta-lactam resistance. This review invites the reader to explore evidence in order to answer the questions: can beta-lactam and beta-lactamase inhibitors adequately treat M. tuberculosis infection and are they a viable option in the management of resistant tuberculosis today?
