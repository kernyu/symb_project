Penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae (PPNG) carrying the blaTEM-135 gene is of particular concern, as it is considered a stepping stone toward resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins. Here, we sought to characterize plasmid types and the occurrence of the blaTEM-135 gene for N. gonorrhoeae clinical isolates from Australia. We found that blaTEM-135 was prevalent in Australian PPNG and was detected on all three major plasmid types.
