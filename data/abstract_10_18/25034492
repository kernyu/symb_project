Currently available antiviral therapies specifically target viral replication by blocking reverse transcription with orally given nucleos(t)ide analogues and are able to specifically suppress viral replication. The unique replication strategy of hepatitis B virus (HBV), however, allows long-term persistence of the viral genome within infected hepatocytes in spite of successful therapy. Thus, antiviral therapy needs to be continued for years. Therapy can result either in the emergence and selection of antiviral-resistant variants or the relapse of viral replication after the termination of antiviral therapy. Resistance is a major problem for 4 of the 5 approved HBV nucleos(t)ide analogues, but it is not the only reason for therapy failure. An accurate phenotypic in vitro assay for resistance allows the identification of a viral variant selected in vivo during antiviral therapy and helps to find therapeutic alternatives. Furthermore, these assays can be used to measure viral fitness and pathogenicity in vitro. With the help of these assays, the prediction of emerging viral variants with drug resistance or increased pathogenic potential can be realized. Phenotypic resistance tests for HBV are not trivial because the virus cannot be readily grown in cell culture. This review focuses on currently available phenotypic assays to evaluate antiviral resistance of HBV and fitness of viral variants in general.
