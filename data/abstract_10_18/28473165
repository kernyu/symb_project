Artemisinin and its derivatives, in combination with partner drugs, are currently the most effective treatments for malaria parasite infection. Even though artemisinin has been widely used for decades, its mechanism of action had remained controversial until recently. Artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) have recently been found to be losing efficacy in Southeast Asia. This 'artemisinin resistance', defined by a delayed parasite clearance time, has been associated with several genetic mutations. As with any other drug resistance phenotype, resistance can best be understood based on its mechanism of action. Recently, it was demonstrated that artemisinin attacks multiple parasitic targets, suggesting that mutations in drug targets are unlikely to cause high-level artemisinin resistance. These findings will help us to better understand the mechanisms of artemisinin resistance and suggest protocol modifications that may improve the efficacy of ACTs.
