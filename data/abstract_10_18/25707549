PURPOSE: To identify risk factors for clindamycin resistance in acute hand abscesses caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 247 consecutive culture-positive hand abscesses from 2010 to 2012 at an urban hospital. Historical and laboratory data from patients with abscesses that grew MRSA with and without clindamycin resistance were compared in a multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus grew on culture from 103 abscesses; 16% of those isolates were resistant to clindamycin. Multivariate analysis showed that younger age, intravenous drug use, and nosocomial acquired MRSA were significant risk factors for concurrent clindamycin resistance. Patients with a history of intravenous drug use and nosocomial acquired MRSA were, respectively, 11 and 5 times more likely to have concurrent clindamycin resistance. History of MRSA infection and human immunodeficiency virus were not identified as risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a history of intravenous drug use or recent contact with health care facilities appear to be a potential reservoir for emerging multidrug-resistant MRSA. Selection of clindamycin as an empiric antibiotic should be especially avoided for these groups. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic III.
