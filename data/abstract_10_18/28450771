BACKGROUND: Cryptococcus neoformans is responsible of cryptococcosis, a life-threatening infection that affects healthy and immunocompromised individuals. It is the first cause of adult acute meningitis in some sub-Saharan African countries with a mortality rate of about 100% in cases of inappropriate therapy. This study aimed at examining the occurrence and the antifungal patterns of Cryptococcus isolates from pigeon droppings and bat guanos in the west region of Cameroon. METHODS: A total of 350 samples were randomly collected from three selected localities of west region of Cameroon. The identification was performed based on capsule production assessed by Indian ink preparation. Additional tests performed were urea broth, glycine and tryptophan assimilation tests. The antifungal susceptibility test was performed by the broth microdilution method. RESULTS: Mycological analysis led to the identification of 98 isolates, of which 57 isolates of C. neoformans var. gattii and 41 isolates of C. neoformans var. neoformans. All the isolates showed resistance to antifungals tested except nystatin which showed MIC mean values ranging between 0.5 microg/mL and 0.65 microg/mL. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of C. neoformans in pigeons and bats excreta in the west region of Cameroon is 28.57 %. C. neoformans var. gattii and C. neoformans var. neoformans are the main serotypes. Isolates found to be resistant to fluconazole and ketoconazole. Our results emphasize the need for further study on the molecular epidemiology in comparison with clinical isolates.
