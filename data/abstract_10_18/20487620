Multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains were identified in 40% of 54 strains from patients presenting with tuberculosis (TB) treatment failure or relapse in Bangui, Central African Republic. Results obtained with the MTBDRplus line-probe assay or rpoB sequencing were 86% concordant with rifampicin (RMP) resistant phenotypes, while the amplification refractory mutation system test was 71% concordant. No mutation was found in RMP-susceptible strains. MTBDRplus and sequencing were concordant with the detection of the S315T mutation in katG in 95% of MDR strains. Sequencing of pncA suggested pyrazinamide resistance in 50% of MDR strains. Knowledge of these resistances should help to implement treatment in low-income countries.
