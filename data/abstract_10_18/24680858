Torque teno viruses (TTV) are widespread in humans, swine as well as in several other animal species. In market ready swine, the reported prevalence ranges between 11% and 100%. Through a national retail sampling plan from the Canadian Integrated Program for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance (CIPARS) program, 283 and 599 liver and pork chop samples, respectively, were collected over a 12-month period from commercial establishments in 5 selected geographical regions of Canada to assess the presence of Torque teno sus viruses (TTSuVs) in these products. TTSuVs were detected in 97.9% of pork chops with viral loads ranging between 1x10(4) and 9.9x10(5) genomic copies (gc)/g and 98.6% of liver samples with viral loads ranging from 1x10(5) to 9.9x10(6) gc/g. A selection of 20 positive samples (10 pork chop and 10 liver) from the 5 geographical regions were further tested for the production, of a 305bp fragment for TTSuV1 and a 253bp fragment for TTSuV2 in the non-coding region. TTSuV1 was present in all 10 liver and 10 pork chops samples while TTSuV2 was detected in 10 liver and 9 pork chop samples. Two different TTSuV1 sequences were simultaneously detected from 5 of 20 samples and 2 different TTSuV2 sequences were detected from 6 of 19 samples. The omnipresence of TTSuVs in commercial pork samples may allow its use as a viral indicator to monitor the effectiveness of cleaning and disinfecting process in slaughtering, cutting, slicing and packaging facilities.
