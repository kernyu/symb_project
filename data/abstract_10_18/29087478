Clinically significant yeast isolates were collected via Taiwan Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance of Yeasts (TSARY) in 2014, and mixed infections were investigated. Among 44 out of 1092 specimens containing multiple species, 17, 11, 5, 3, and 8 were from urine, sputum, blood, ascites, and 6 others, respectively. There predominant combinations of mixed infection were 14 Candida albicans/Candida glabrata, 13 C. albicans/Candida tropicalis, and 9 C. glabrata/C. tropicalis. Furthermore, we also detected fluconazole resistant isolates Candida norvegensis and Candida krusei. Hence, it is important to accurately identify the species with different drug susceptibilities when they are in the same specimen.
