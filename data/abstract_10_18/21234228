Due to the possible emergence of resistance and safety concerns on certain treatments, development of new drugs against parasites is essential for the effective control and subsequent eradication of parasitic infections. Several drug targets have been identified which are either genes or proteins essential for the parasite survival and distinct from the hosts. These include the phosphagen kinases (PKs) which are enzymes that play a key role in maintenance of homeostasis in cells exhibiting high or variable rates of energy turnover by catalizing the reversible transfer of a phosphate between ATP and naturally occurring guanidine compounds. PKs have been identified in a number of important human and animal parasites and were also shown to be significant in survival and adaptation to stress conditions. The potential of parasite PKs as novel chemotherapeutic targets remains to be explored.
