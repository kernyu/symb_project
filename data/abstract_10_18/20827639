Pneumonia is one of the oldest and best known diseases in mankind. Morbidity and mortality of this disease are remarkable. This has not been changed with the development of modern antibiotic therapy. On the contrary new challenges have arisen, more elderly and comorbid patients are involved and an increase in antibiotic resistance has appeared. An improvement in diagnosis and the introduction of risk stratification approaches has led to a standardisation in therapy. Vaccination strategies for special pathogens like S. PNEUMONIAE have reduced the burden of disease. For decades research was focused on the development of new antibiotics. The failure of this strategy has directed more attention to the host-pathogen interaction. Modulation of innate immunity is one of the key issues to overcome the future challenges in this field.
