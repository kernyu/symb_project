With the approval of second-wave direct-acting antivirals simeprevir, sofosbuvir and faldaprevir in 2014-2015, for genotype 1 hepatitis C, patients and doctors will have more treatment options. During a first period, these treatments will still be used with peginterferon and ribavirin. The second wave of IFN-based triple therapy will have benefits and risk. These treatments have the following advantages: higher efficacy with more patient candidates for a shorten treatment duration (12-24 weeks, instead of 48 weeks). These new treatments appear to have a better safety profile than first generation, with no additional increase in anaemia over peginterferon/ribavirin. Then, these treatments are to take for patients with a decrease in pill burden (these three direct-acting antivirals are given orally one pill a day). Simeprevir and sofosbuvir may be approved in the US and Europe, in 2014, at the time this manuscript will be released. Approval of faldaprevir will follow. These direct-acting antivirals with many others will hopefully be combined in future interferon-free regimens. The goal of this review to summarize the results and safety of simeprevir, faldaprevir and sofosbuvir, to advise physicians and to inform patients on the benefits and risks of these second-wave IFN-based regimens for HCV genotype infection.
