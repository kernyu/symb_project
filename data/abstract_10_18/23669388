In the absence of an effective vaccine against HIV-1 infection, anti-HIV-1 strategies play a major role in disease control. However, the rapid emergence of drug resistance against all currently used anti-HIV-1 molecules necessitates the development of new antiviral molecules and/or strategies against HIV-1 infection. In this study, we have identified a benzamide derivative named AH0109 that exhibits potent anti-HIV-1 activity at an 50% effective concentration of 0.7 muM in HIV-1-susceptible CD4(+) C8166 T cells. Mechanistic analysis revealed that AH0109 significantly inhibits both HIV-1 reverse transcription and viral cDNA nuclear import. Furthermore, our infection experiments indicated that AH0109 is capable of disrupting the replication of HIV-1 strains that are resistant to the routinely used anti-HIV-1 drugs zidovudine, lamivudine, nevirapine, and raltegravir. Together, these findings provide evidence for a newly identified antiviral molecule that can potentially be developed as an anti-HIV-1 agent.
