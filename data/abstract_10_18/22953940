Eleven Lactobacillus plantarum strains isolated from traditional Chinese fermented foods were investigated for their in vitro scavenging activity against hydroxyl and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radicals, and their resistance to hydrogen peroxide. L. plantarum C88 at a dose of 10(10) CFU/ml showed the highest hydroxyl radical and DPPH scavenging activities, with inhibition rates of 44.31% and 53.05%, respectively. Resistance of intact cells to hydrogen peroxide was also found in all strains. L. plantarum C88 was the most resistant strain against hydrogen peroxide. When L. plantarum C88 was administered to senescent mice suffering oxidative stress induced by d-galactose, the serum superoxide dismutase activity, the glutathione peroxidase activity and the total antioxidant capacity in liver increased significantly, while the level of malondialdehyde in liver decreased significantly. L. plantarum C88 isolated from traditional Chinese fermented dairy tofu could be considered as a potential antioxidant to be applied in functional foods.
