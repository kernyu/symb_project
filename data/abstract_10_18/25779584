We obtained a series of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates, including both daptomycin-susceptible strain TD1 and daptomycin-resistant strain TD4, from a patient. We determined the complete genome sequences of TD1 and TD4 using next-generation sequencing, and only four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified, one each in capB (E58K), rpoB (H481Y), lytN (I16V), and mprF (V351E). We determined that these four SNPs were sufficient to cause the strains to develop daptomycin, vancomycin, and rifampin resistance.
