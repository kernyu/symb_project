OBJECTIVE: To observe the safety and efficacy of Colistimethate sodium in children infected with gram-negative bacteria, susceptible only to colistimethate sodium. METHODS: This prospective observational study done over 2 years observed children who received colistin for >48 h, for renal failure as defined by p-RIFLE criteria. RESULTS: Out of 68 children, 52 (76.5%) survived. There were three children with evidence of acute kidney injury and none had neurotoxicity. Serum creatinine significantly decreased at 48 h and at end of treatment, from that at beginning of therapy (P=0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Colistimethate sodium is effective against carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, and is safe in children.
