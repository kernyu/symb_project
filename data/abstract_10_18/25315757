Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections are a leading cause of death among all fatalities caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. With the rise of increasing resistance to current antibiotics, new antimicrobials and treatment strategies are urgently needed. Thiazole compounds have been shown to possess potent antimicrobial activity. A lead thiazole 1 and a potent derivative 2 were synthesized and their activity in combination with glycopeptide antibiotics was determined against an array of MRSA and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) clinical isolates. In addition, the anti-biofilm activity of the novel thiazoles was investigated against S. epidermidis. Compound 2 behaved synergistically with vancomycin against MRSA and was able to resensitize VRSA to vancomycin, reducing its MIC by 512-fold in two strains. In addition, both thiazole compounds were superior to vancomycin in significantly reducing S. epidermidis biofilm mass. Collectively, the results obtained demonstrate that compounds 1 and 2 possess potent antimicrobial activity alone or in combination with vancomycin against multidrug-resistant staphylococci and show potential for use in disrupting staphylococcal biofilm.
