Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas belong to the most aggressive solid malignancies. The devastating prognosis of this tumor entity is associated with a high degree of resistance to systemic therapy approaches. Although new combination chemotherapy regimens have recently demonstrated a significant survival benefit compared to gemcitabine-based therapies, the search for novel treatment options still remains a huge challenge. After numerous potential targets have proven to be futile in clinical trials, recent efforts have been made to both improve drug delivery and to identify drugs targeting novel signalling pathways within the tumors including the putative stem cell compartment and the tumor stroma. Furthermore, predictive markers are needed to define tailored treatment regimens according to the molecular profile of individual tumors. In this review, current therapeutic strategies as well as emerging avenues for systemic therapy and response prediction for individualized therapy of pancreatic cancer patients are discussed which are currently evaluated to overcome the highly drug-resistant phenotype of this malignancy.
