The growing emergence of multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) strains is obstructing efforts for the control and management of TB. Proper management of MDR-TB relies on early recognition of drug resistance followed by timely treatment initiation. Several diagnostic methods, both phenotypic and molecular, have been developed in last few years for rapid identification of drug resistant (DR)-TB. Revised national tuberculosis control programmes (RNTPs) may find it tough to choose from the puzzling variety of rapid tests. Here, we present an outline of the available methods, discussing their basis, advantages and deficiencies.
