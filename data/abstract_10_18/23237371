Genetic variability and genotypic antimicrobial resistance (AMR) of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli from commercial broiler farms were investigated in this study. Campylobacter isolates were genetically characterized by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and flaA-SVR and flaB-SVR sequence-based typing. Eight RAPD types were identified in C. jejuni and three in C. coli, while 16 fla profiles were detected among all isolates. Further, 13 flaA-SVR and 13 flaB-SVR alleles were identified. Both typing methods detected a high level of genetic diversity, but fla-SVR typing showed a higher discriminatory power. Indeed, Simpson's index of fla typing (D=0.920) was higher than that of RAPD typing (D=0.814). Moreover, the association of flaA-SVR and flaB-SVR sequence analysis showed a higher discriminatory power compared with the sequence analysis of single loci. Isolates were also analysed by the mismatch amplification mutation assay PCR test and the detection of cmeB gene to determine the occurrence of genetic determinants of AMR to macrolides and fluoroquinolones and multidrug resistance. The A2074C and A2075G mutations in the 23S rRNA gene, the C257T mutation in the gyrA gene, and the cmeB gene were higher in C. coli (19.0%, 67.0%, 100.0% and 100.0%, respectively) than in C. jejuni (0.0%, 3.1%, 48.3% and 48.3%, respectively). This study showed a high degree of genetic diversity and a high prevalence of genetic determinants of macrolide resistance, fluoroquinolone resistance and multidrug resistance among C. jejuni and C. coli isolates from Italian commercial broiler farms.
