Following the introduction of a national abattoir-based monitoring programme for Salmonella in pigs, advisory visits were made to pig farms in England and Wales with high Salmonella seroprevalence assessed by muscle tissue fluid (meat juice) ELISA. Samples (n = 15 790), including pooled pen floor faeces (n = 12 136), were collected for Salmonella culture from 296 farms, between October 2003 and February 2008. Salmonella was isolated from 4489 (28%) of all samples collected, including 3301 (27%) of pooled pen floor faecal samples, from 270 (91%) of farms visited. Salmonella Typhimurium and S. Derby were the most prevalent serovars, representing 64% and 16% of isolates serotyped, respectively. The main phage types of S. Typhimurium identified were U288 and DT193. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) was seen in 92% of isolates tested, with the highest frequencies of resistance occurring to tetracyclines (T), sulphonamide compounds (SU), ampicillin (AM), sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SXT), streptomycin (S) and chloramphenicol (C). Fifty-nine AMR patterns were observed, the most frequent of these being T, AM, SXT, C, S, SU, seen in 35% of isolates tested. Multi-drug resistance was commonly found, with 67% of isolates submitted for AMR testing showing resistance to between four and nine antimicrobials.
