OBJECTIVES: To study the single-tablet regimen (STR) combination rilpivirine/tenofovir/emtricitabine (RPV/TDF/FTC) as soon as it became available. We describe a 14 month follow-up in a real clinical setting with a focus on resistance to RPV/TDF/FTC and polymorphisms associated with these drugs. METHODS: We estimated drug resistance at STR baseline by combining all available resistance tests, resulting in a cumulative virtual genotype. Physicians were advised of current or archived resistance mutations for the three drugs. Virological response was analysed according to resistance genotype at baseline. RESULTS: Three hundred and sixty-three patients received RPV/TDF/FTC; 79% had received previous treatment and RPV/TDF/FTC was the result of a switch of one drug to rilpivirine in two-thirds of cases. The cumulative genotype showed 4% of rilpivirine resistance mutations at baseline and 16% of polymorphisms concerning non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). With a median duration of STR of 8 months, 78% of patients with these polymorphisms were virologically suppressed compared with 96% with wild-type genotypes. Five genotypes were determined during the follow-up, revealing three rilpivirine resistance-associated mutations: E138Q/Y181I, M230L and K101P (potentially with a K101Q intermediate). CONCLUSIONS: This observational study reflects routine clinical practice and the relevance of virological advice. It also confirms the efficacy of this STR (RPV/TDF/FTC) for naive and virologically suppressed pretreated patients with a low prevalence of virological failure and resistance if the cumulative baseline genotype is free of resistance to NNRTIs and/or polymorphisms associated with NNRTIs.
