Food-borne salmonellosis is an important public health problem worldwide and the second leading cause of food-borne illnesses in Hong Kong. In this study, the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella in meat products in Hong Kong were determined. Interestingly, a plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) gene combination, oqxAB, which mediates resistance to nalidixic acid, chloramphenicol, and olaquindox, was for the first time detectable on the chromosomes of two Salmonella enterica serovar Derby isolates. Further surveillance of oqxAB in Salmonella will be needed.
