Tigecycline (TGC), an antibiotic belonging to glycylcyclines, is active against Gram-positive bacteria, including multi-resistant bacteria, and most of the Gram-negative bacteria, including extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producers (ESBL) and Acinetobacter sp. TGC is not active on Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The microbiological laboratory from the university hospital of Angers participates in the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) since 2006. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of TGC and of various comparators against nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens. We also evaluated the effectiveness of TGC on a panel of strains isolated between 2006 and 2009 in the university hospital of Angers. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined using the microdilution method. A total of 760 clinical strains were tested. TGC had a very good activity against Gram-positive bacteria, with 100 % of susceptibility for all the strains tested, irrespective of their resistance profile. Concerning Gram-negative bacteria, TGC was active against 93 % of Enterobacteriaceae, with a MIC 90 not exceeding 2mg/L. Whole of the 20 strains ESBL-producers tested were susceptible to TGC. Acinetobacter sp. were also inhibited at low concentrations of TGC, with a MIC 90 of 1mg/L. These results suggest that TGC can be a useful therapeutic alternative, especially for infections involving multiresistant bacteria.
