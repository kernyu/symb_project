The aim of the present study was to determine the antibiotic resistance patterns and distribution of heavy-metal resistance in Shewanella putrefaciens strains isolated from shellfishes collected from West Sea; and to determine the relationship, if any, between antibiotic and heavy-metal resistance in these strains. Among the 15 strains isolated, two strains, SY1 and SY2, showed heavy-metal resistance in addition to high resistance to seven antibiotics: cephalothin, gentamicin, erythromycin, vancomycin, ampicillin, rifampicin, and streptomycin. We conclude that heavy-metal contamination imposes long-term, widespread, and recalcitrant selection pressure, which potentially contributes to the maintenance and spread of antibiotic resistance factors in bacteria. Moreover, this fact holds both environmental and clinical importance.
