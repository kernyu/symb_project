The capsid of hepatitis B virus (HBV) plays a vital role in virus DNA replication. Targeting nucleocapsid function has been demonstrated as an effective approach for anti-HBV drug development. A high-throughput screening and mechanism study revealed the hit compound 4a as an HBV assembly effector (AEf), which could inhibit HBV replication by inducing the formation of HBV DNA-free capsids. The subsequent SAR study and drug-like optimization resulted in the discovery of the lead candidate 4r, with potent antiviral activity (IC50 = 0.087 +/- 0.002 muM), low cytotoxicity (CC50 = 90.6 +/- 2.06 muM), sensitivity to nucleoside analogue-resistant HBV mutants, and synergistic effect with nucleoside analogues in HepG2.2.15 cells.
