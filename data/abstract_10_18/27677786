Sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (SOF/LDV) is the first all-oral ribavirin-free treatment approved for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 6, offering a safe and highly efficacious treatment option. Large studies evaluating real-world outcomes of this regimen are lacking. We aim to evaluate real-world treatment outcomes for HCV genotype 6. A retrospective cohort study evaluated 65 adults (age >/=18) with chronic HCV genotype 6 treated with SOF/LDV without ribavirin at a community gastroenterology clinic in the United States from November 2014 to May 2016. Rates of undetectable virus at week 4 on treatment, at end of treatment (EOT) and SVR12 were stratified by the presence of cirrhosis and prior treatment (treatment naive vs treatment experienced). Among 65 patients with chronic HCV genotype 6 treated with SOF/LDV (52.3% male, mean age 66.3 years [SD 9.7], 41.5% cirrhosis and 15.4% treatment experienced), 97.3% had undetectable virus at week 4 on treatment, 96.9% had undetectable virus at EOT and 95.3% achieved SVR12. SVR12 was 100% in females vs 91.2% in males, P=.096, and 92.3% in patients with cirrhosis vs 97.4% in those without cirrhosis, P=.347. Resistance testing of treatment failures was attempted but unsuccessful due to lack of conforming primers to define the possible resistance mutations. Among the largest U.S. community-based real-world cohort of Asian chronic HCV genotype 6 patients treated with all-oral SOF/LDV without ribavirin, SVR12 was similar to SVR12 reported in clinical trials, confirming the safety and effectiveness of this regimen and validating current HCV genotype 6 treatment guideline recommendations.
