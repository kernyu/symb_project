The identification and early development of novel antimicrobial agents for use in veterinary medicine is subject to many of the same business and technical challenges as those found in antimicrobial agent use for human infectious disease. However, as awareness that some of the antimicrobial classes used in veterinary medicine are the same as used in human medicine, concern by multiple stakeholders has increased that this nonhuman use might be contributing to the problem of antimicrobial resistance to pathogens in humans, particularly with regard to food-borne diseases, such as salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis. Consequently, the interface between veterinary and human antibiotic use and resistance, especially with respect to human microbial food safety, has begun to redirect the industry pipeline of novel antimicrobial agents to be commercialized for use in veterinary medicine.
