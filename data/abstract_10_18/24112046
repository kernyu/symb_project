The bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) is a validated target for broad spectrum antibiotics. However, the efficiency of drugs is reduced by resistance. To discover novel RNAP inhibitors, a pharmacophore based on the alignment of described inhibitors was used for virtual screening. In an optimization process of hit compounds, novel derivatives with improved in vitro potency were discovered. Investigations concerning the molecular mechanism of RNAP inhibition reveal that they prevent the protein-protein interaction (PPI) between sigma(70) and the RNAP core enzyme. Besides of reducing RNA formation, the inhibitors were shown to interfere with bacterial lipid biosynthesis. The compounds were active against Gram-positive pathogens and revealed significantly lower resistance frequencies compared to clinically used rifampicin.
