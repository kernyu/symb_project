Get Smart About Antibiotics Week is November 14-20, 2016. This annual observance is intended to engage health care providers, professional societies, advocacy groups, for-profit companies, state and local health departments, the general public, the media, and others in an effort to improve antibiotic stewardship in outpatient, inpatient, nursing home, and animal health settings. During this week, participants will raise awareness of the threat of antibiotic resistance and emphasize the importance of appropriate antibiotic use across all health care settings. Get Smart About Antibiotics Week coincides with the World Health Organization's World Antibiotic Awareness Week and European Antibiotic Awareness Day (November 18). In addition to the United States and European Union, other participating countries and international organizations include Australia, Canada, and the Pan American Health Organization.
