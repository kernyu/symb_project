OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to identify the predictors of mortality and to evaluate the impact of methicillin resistance on outcome in patients with Staphylococcus aureus infection according to underlying conditions and type of infection. METHODS: An observational cohort study including 4949 patients with S. aureus infection was conducted. We compared data from patients with MRSA infection with those with MSSA infection. RESULTS: The 30-day mortality rate of MRSA group was significantly higher than that of MSSA group (15.6% vs. 6.2%, P < 0.001). However, MRSA infection was not found to be independent risk factor for mortality after adjusting for other variables (OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.80-1.32). When we analyzed patients with S. aureus bacteremia (n = 709), MRSA infection was found to be significantly associated with mortality in multivariate analysis (Adjusted OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.15-2.49). When the 30-day mortality rates were compared according to underlying diseases, the 30-day mortality rate of MRSA group was significantly higher than that of MSSA group in patients with malignancy or renal diseases. MRSA infection was also found to be one of the independent risk factors for mortality in patients with malignancy (adjusted OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.06-2.70) and in those with renal disease (adjusted OR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.0-2.89), after adjustment for host variables. CONCLUSIONS: Methicillin resistance adversely affected the outcome of patients with S. aureus infection, in patients with cancer or renal disease and in those with S. aureus bacteremia, although MRSA infection was not found to be significantly associated with higher mortality in overall patient population.
