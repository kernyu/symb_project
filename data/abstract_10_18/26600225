Approximately 3% of the world's population is chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). In some southeast Asian countries the prevalence of HCV ( approximately 6%-7%) far exceeds that seen in the United States (1.8%). The lesser known HCV genotype 6 (HCV-6) is also common in patients from southeast Asia and the surrounding regions. Most data on direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) to date have been derived from clinical trials conducted in Western countries, where HCV-6 is rare. The standard of care for patients with HCV-6 is still pegylated interferon and ribavirin. However, data are emerging for several DAA combinations.
