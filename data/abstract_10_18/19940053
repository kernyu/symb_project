We report the case of a 55-year-old man who exhibited a nodular pneumonia 4 months after an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Culture of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid revealed Nocardia pseudobrasiliensis. This recently described carbapenem-resistant species should be included in the differential diagnosis of fungal infection in this setting.
