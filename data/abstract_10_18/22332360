A number of new phosphoramidates of acyclovir--compounds of interest as anti-virals against resistant strains of virus herpes was synthesized. Several methods of synthesis of these compounds were suggested. Optimal method appeared to be the obtaining of phosphoramidates through the phosphomonocloride with its subsequent treatment with various amines. Two compounds have shown moderate activity against HSV-1.
