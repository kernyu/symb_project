Type I interferons induce a complex transcriptional program that leads to a generalized antiviral response against a large panel of viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). However, despite the fact that interferons negatively regulate HIV-1 ex vivo, a chronic interferon state is linked to the progression of AIDS and to robust viral replication, rather than protection, in vivo. To explain this apparent contradiction, we hypothesized that HIV-1 may have evolved a partial resistance to interferon, and to test this hypothesis, we analyzed the effects of alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) on the infectivity of HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2), and rhesus monkey simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac). The results we obtained indicate that HIV-1 is more resistant to an IFN-alpha-induced response than are HIV-2 and SIVmac. Our data indicate that the accumulation of viral DNA is more compromised following the infection of IFN-alpha-treated cells with HIV-2 and SIVmac than with HIV-1. This defect correlates with a faster destabilization of HIV-2 viral nucleoprotein complexes (VNCs), suggesting a link between VNC destabilization and impaired viral DNA (vDNA) accumulation. The differential susceptibilities to IFN-alpha of the primate lentiviruses tested here do not map to the capsid protein (CA), excluding de facto a role for human tripartite motif protein isoform 5 alpha (Trim5alpha) in this restriction; this also suggests that an additional restriction mechanism differentially affects primate lentivirus infection. The different behaviors of HIV-1 and HIV-2 with respect to IFN-alpha responses may account at least in part for the differences in pathogenesis observed between these two virus types.
