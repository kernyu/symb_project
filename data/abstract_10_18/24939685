Streptococcus pneumoniae causes life threatening infections and necessitate for impediment and controlling disease; to conquer this, information is needed about serotype distribution and patterns of antibiotic resistance. The present study was to determine the serotype distribution of S. pneumoniae isolated from the entire age group individual and to correlate this distribution with susceptibility. Cases of pneumococcal infections have been reviewed for serotyping and antibiotic susceptibility. Out of 117 pneumococcal isolates 45 (39%) were penicillin-resistant, 84 (72%) were erythromycin-resistant and 100% were co-trimoxazole resistant. The most frequently isolated serotypes were 23F, 19F, 14, 6B, 5, 6A, 19A and 9V. PCV7, PCV10 and PCV13 coverage was 68%, 79%, 87%, respectively. Similarly, there was similarity in PCV7 coverage for non invasive isolates (64.5%) and invasive isolates (72.2%). The study state that common pneumococcal serotypes were present in similar ways as reported in literature. A continuous survey of pneumococcal infected population is requirement and necessity for success of vaccination.
