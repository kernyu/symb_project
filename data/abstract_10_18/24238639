Resistance to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in CLL is associated with overexpression of antiapoptotic proteins induced by signals from the microenvironment. In vitro, dasatinib effectively inhibits expression of anti-apoptotic regulators and restores fludarabine sensitivity in activated CLL. The aim of this study was to evaluate efficacy of one cycle of dasatinib monotherapy (100mg/day, days 1-28) followed by combination of dasatinib with fludarabine (40mg/m(2)/day, days 1-3 every 28 day) for a total of 6 cycles in fludarabine-refractory CLL. The primary endpoint was overall response rate according to the IWCLL'08 criteria. 20 patients were enrolled: 18 completed at least one cycle of treatment of which 67% finished at least 2 cycles of combination treatment. 3 of these 18 patients reached a formal PR (16.7%). Majority of patients obtained some reduction in lymph node (LN) size. Most frequent toxicity was related to myelosuppression. NF-kappaB RNA expression levels of circulating CLL cells decreased whereas the levels of pro-apoptotic NOXA increased during treatment. In conclusion, dasatinib/fludarabine combination has modest clinical efficacy in fludarabine-refractory patients.
