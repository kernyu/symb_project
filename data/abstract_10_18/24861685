INTRODUCTION: Urinary tract infection by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) is a growing infection risk and may even lead in many cases to therapeutic impasses because of their multidrug resistance. AIM OF THE STUDY: Follow, over a 5-year period, the evolution of the epidemiological profile of uropathogenic ESBL-E and describe their current level of antibiotic resistance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective work was made over a period of 5 years (from 1st January 2008 to 31st December 2012). It focused on all the ESBL-E strains isolated from all the urinary samples at the microbiology laboratory of Avicenne hospital, Marrakech (Morocco). RESULTS: We noticed in 5 years, an important increase in the prevalence of ESBL-E. The higher prevalence of ESBL-E (51%) was recorded in the urology department. The study of the antibiotic resistance of the ESBL-E had shown antibiotic co-resistances to the ciprofloxacin (82%), to sulfamethoxazole-trimethropim (85%), to gentamicin (74%), to amikacine (51%). Our results also showed, for the first time in our region, an emergence in the resistance of enterobacteria producing ESBL to imipenem (10%). CONCLUSION: The significant increase in the prevalence of ESBL-E has become a concern at the hospitals and in community medicine as well. The study of the resistance of ESBL-E strains antibiotics showed high rates of co-resistance to antibiotics, including the usual urology molecules. LEVEL OF PROOF: 5.
