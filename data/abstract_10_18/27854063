BACKGROUND: Treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C who failed the triple therapy with first generation of protease inhibitors is not still defined. The combined use of sofosbuvir (SOF) and daclatasvir (DCV) seems to be promising due to higher genetic barrier, good tolerance and effectiveness. METHODS: We described the treatment with this drug combination in a real-life cohort of 20 cirrhotic patients with genotype 1 who failed the triple therapy. RESULTS: 18 of them (90%) with Child-Pugh A, 11 (55%) with genotype 1a, 17 (85%) with more than 1 and 8 (40%) with more than 2 previous failed treatment; all patients had at baseline NS3 resistance-associated variants related to triple therapy failure. RBV was not administered due to anemia in previous treatments. The sustained virological response was 100%. CONCLUSION: Treatment with SOF + DCV without RBV for 24 weeks is safe and effective in cirrhotic patients who failed triple therapy with the first generation of protease inhibitors.
