We report a case of acute hepatitis B virus genotype A vaccine escape mutant infection with loss of HBV vaccine-induced seropositivity in a HIV-1 infected patient. His HBV is unresponsive to tenofovir/emtricitabine treatment demonstrated by persistent viremia despite lacking known resistance mutations and while having an undetectable HIV-1 viral load.
