The in vitro activity of mastoparan-AF, an amphipathic antimicrobial peptide isolated from the hornet venom of Vespa affinis, alone and in combination with various clinically used antibiotics, was investigated against 21 Escherichia coli isolates/strains. Most E. coli isolates tested were detected containing multiple-antimicrobial resistance genes. Antimicrobial activity of mastoparan-AF was measured by MIC, MBC, time-kill kinetic assay and chequerboard titration method. Mastoparan-AF exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against most multiple-antibiotic-resistant E. coli isolates at the concentrations ranging from 4 to 16 mug/ml. Combination studies showed that mastoparan-AF acts synergistically with certain antibiotics, i.e., cephalothin or gentamicin, against some multiple-antibiotic-resistant E. coli isolates. In conclusion, mastoparan-AF alone or in combination with other antibiotics could be promising as alternatives for combating multiple-antibiotic-resistant E. coli in future clinical applications.
