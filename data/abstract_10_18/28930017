During antimicrobial drug resistance testing for Vibrio spp. from coastal waters of Germany, we identified 4 nontoxigenic, carbapenem-resistant V. cholerae isolates. We used whole-genome sequencing to identify the carbapenemase gene blaVCC-1. In addition, a molecular survey showed that more blaVCC-1-harboring isolates are present in coastal waters of Germany.
