BACKGROUND: Treatment with fluoroquinolones is associated with the development of Clostridium difficile and extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (ESBL). Clostridium difficile and ESBL are resistant to many antibiotics and each may cause pouchitis after restorative proctocolectomy (RPC) refractory to empirical antibiotic therapy. AIM: To assess the prevalence and establish risk factors for the development of ESBL and Clostridium difficile toxins (CDT) in RPC patients with recurrent or refractory pouchitis under follow-up at our institution over a 1-year period. METHOD: An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect CDT and a culture technique was used to identity ESBL in faecal samples. All patients had previously received fluoroquinolone treatment. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients (35 (74%) men; median age 42 years) underwent testing at a median interval from RPC of 8 (range 1-25) years. No patient had a positive CDT result, but ESBL bacteria were identified in 16 (33%) samples. ESBL positivity was significantly related to prepouch ileitis (P = 0.035) and maintenance antibiotic therapy (P = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS: Extended spectrum beta-lactamase, but not CDT, is a common finding in faecal samples from patients with recurrent or refractory pouchitis. Treatment with maintenance antibiotics and prepouch ileitis are risk factors for developing ESBL-producing bacteria.
