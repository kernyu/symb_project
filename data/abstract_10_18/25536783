The main studies of a group of antimicrobial compounds produced by Enterococcus genus bacteria: bacteriocins, organic acids, activated oxygen metabolites, enzymes, exopolysaccharides--are described in the review. Data on synergic interaction of these substances in killing of pathogens, formation of active substances from different components as a result of metabolic activity of enterococci are presented. Production of these compounds is a reflection of competitive habitation of bacteria under the conditions of multi-species microbiomes and ensures colonization resistance of host biotopes. A complementation of the group of bacterial antimicrobial compounds by compounds that do not have a direct effect on the growth of microorganisms but suppress pathogenic potential of infectious disease causative agents is assumed.
