The spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria is a global threat that shakes the foundations of modern healthcare. beta-Lactamases are enzymes that confer resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in bacteria, and there is a critical need for new inhibitors of these enzymes for combination therapy together with an antibiotic. With this in mind, we have screened a library of 490 fragments to identify starting points for the development of new inhibitors of the class D beta-lactamase oxacillinase-48 (OXA-48) through surface plasmon resonance (SPR), dose-rate inhibition assays, and X-ray crystallography. Furthermore, we have uncovered structure-activity relationships and used alternate conformations from a crystallographic structure to grow a fragment into a more potent compound with a KD of 50 muM and an IC50 of 18 muM.
