BACKGROUND: In recent years, there has been a worldwide increase in infections caused by microorganisms resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents. METHODS: In the past few decades, an increased prevalence of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens, including Enterococcus spp., carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp., carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, and resistant Candida spp., also has been observed among intra-abdominal infections (IAIs). RESULTS: The increasing prevalence of multi-drug resistance is responsible for a substantial increase in morbidity and mortality rates associated with IAIs. CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary for every surgeon treating IAIs to understand the underlying epidemiology and clinical consequences of antimicrobial resistance. Emergence of drug resistance, combined with the lack of new agents in the drug development pipeline, indicates that judicious antimicrobial management will be necessary to preserve the utility of the drugs available currently.
