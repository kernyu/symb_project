BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Burns infections and urinary tract infections are the most important prevalent diseases in Asian countries, such as Iraq. Klebsiella pneumoniae is one of the most important bacteria cause this type of infections especially in hospitals. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of multi-drug resistance K. pneumoniae and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases producing K. pneumoniae isolates from inpatients with urinary tract infection and burns infections in Al-Kufa hospital in Al-Najaf province, Iraq. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 285 clinical samples were collected from in-patients infected with urinary tract infection (141 urine samples) and burns infections (144 burns swabs). Fourteen different antibiotics were used by disc diffusion method and 13 antimicrobials resistance genes were used by PCR technique. RESULTS: A total of 43 K. pneumoniae strains were isolated. The highest resistance rate was observed for amoxicillin 25 mug and amoxicillin+clavulanic acid 20+10 mug (97.67%) while the lowest resistance rate was observed for imipenem 10 mug (9.30%). The most common resistance associated-genes were blaSHV (86.04%) and at lower prevalence were IMP (9.30%). CONCLUSION: Klebsiella pneumoniae strains isolated from burns infections were more virulent than those isolated from urinary tract infections.
