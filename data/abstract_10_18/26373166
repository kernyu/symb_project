The objective of this paper is to review and summarize the antimicrobial efficacy of the acyldepsipeptides and to indicate the prospects of the therapeutic values of these compounds. This work is enriched by the description of the mutations within the clpP1clpP2 and c1pP3clpP4 operons of Streptomyces lividans, which are considered to be the potential mechanism of the acyldepsipeptide (ADEP)-resistance development. The researchers' conclusions demonstrated a significant impact on microorganisms including the destabilization of bacterial cell division in Bacillus subtilis 168, Staphylococcus aureus HG001 and Streptococcus pneumoniae G9A strains. The results of animal studies show higher bactericidal effectiveness of the acyldepsipeptides ADEP-2 and ADEP-4 compared to linezolid. ADEPs may be considered as a very important mechanism of defense against the increasing resistance of microorganisms . They also might prevent or reduce the risk of many epidemiological events.
