Diagnosis and therapy of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) can be difficult due to the variability of the clinical pictures and resistance to therapy. There is no vaccine currently available for CL. The aim of the present review is to describe different topical treatment modalities for old world CL. The mainstays of treatment for old world CL are pentavalent antimony compounds which are administered parenterally or intralesionally. New topical treatment alternatives have been available within the past few years. Amongst several treatments used topically, physical therapies including cryotherapy, heat therapy and CO2 laser are promising for the treatment of old world CL. Along with that, other randomized placebo controlled trials should be designed to find new effective therapeutic regimens.
