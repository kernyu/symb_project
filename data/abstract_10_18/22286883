HIV-1 resistance testing is one important part in the diagnostics of antiretroviral treatment and is commonly done by genotyping. Currently, two systems are commercially available and, despite being far from easy to use, these have achieved a high degree of sophistication. Modifications of standard kit protocols might be necessary based on the clinical situation. Although resistance reports based on decision rules are a part of both systems, considerable knowledge and skills are nevertheless required by the user to establish useful clinical data out of detected resistance patterns. Both systems described here have their advantages and disadvantages; a decision for one or the other system needs to be based on individual requirements. The future might lie in so-called 'next-generation sequencing' systems based on pyrosequencing, which enable a high throughput and the detection of minor variants of less than 1%.
