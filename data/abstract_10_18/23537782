Candida nivariensis is a cryptic species, phenotypically indistinguishable from Candida glabrata and identified by molecular methods. Aside its isolation from broncho-alveolar lavage, we report for the first time the etiologic role of C. nivariensis in 4 patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis. Of 100 phenotypically identified C. glabrata isolates originating from vaginal swabs, 4 were identified as C. nivariensis by polymerase chain reaction and confirmed by sequencing. All of the C. nivariensis isolates exhibited white colonies on CHROMagar. Phylogenetic analysis revealed genotypic diversity in the C. nivariensis isolates originating from within or outside of India. Barring a solitary C. nivariensis isolate with MIC, 16 mug/mL of fluconazole, the rest were susceptible to voriconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, isavuconazole, amphotericin B, and echinocandins. The patient with high fluconazole MIC did not respond to fluconazole therapy. It is suggested that the prevalence of this species is likely to be much higher than apparent from the sporadic published reports.
