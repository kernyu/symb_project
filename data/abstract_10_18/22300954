Successful international clones have recently emerged among Escherichia coli that produce CTX-M beta-lactamases as important causes of community-onset urinary tract and bloodstream infections. One hundred and seven isolates that belong to sequence types (STs) ST38, ST131, ST405, ST648, and 38 nonrelated CTX-M-producing E. coli from Canada and the Netherlands were assigned to phylogenetic groups and tested for the presence of genes encoding for virulence factors (VFs) using established multiplex polymerase chain reaction. The STs E. coli were significantly more resistant to antibiotics--ST38, ST405, and ST648 belonged to phylogenetic group D while ST131 belonged to B2. Secreted autotransporter toxin (sat), aerobactin receptor, and pathogenicity island marker were significantly more common among the STs; the heat-resistant agglutinin (hra) was present in ST38, sat, and uropathogenic-specific protein, and putative adhesin-siderophore receptor was more common in ST131, while outer membrane protease T was present in ST648. ST131 had a significantly higher VF score. In conclusion, the precise role of these VFs remains to be elucidated; however, we have identified certain putative VFs that possibly contribute to the fitness and success of certain sequence types.
