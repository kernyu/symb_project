BACKGROUND: Acute otitis media (AOM) is a leading cause of childhood morbidity and antibiotic prescriptions. We examined etiologic changes in AOM after introduction of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine as routine immunization for Japanese children in 2014. Serotypes, resistance genotypes, antibiotic susceptibilities, and multilocus sequence typing of pneumococcal isolates were also characterized. METHODS: Otolaryngologists prospectively collected middle ear fluid from 582 children by tympanocentesis or sampling through a spontaneously ruptured tympanic membrane between June 2016 and January 2017. Causative pathogens were identified by bacterial culture and real-time PCR for bacteria. Serotypes, resistance genotypes, sequence types, and susceptibilities to14 antimicrobial agents were determined for pneumococcal isolates. RESULTS: At least 1 bacterial pathogen was identified in 473 of the samples (81.3%). Nontypable Haemophilus influenzae (54.8%) was detected most frequently, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (25.4%), Streptococcus pyogenes (2.9%), and others. Pneumococci of current vaccine serotypes have decreased dramatically from 82.1% in 2006 to 18.5% (P <0.001). Commonest serotypes were 15A (14.8%), 3 (13.9%), and 35B (11.1%). Serotype 3 was significantly less frequent among children receiving PCV13 compared with PCV7 (P = 0.002). Genotypic penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae accounted for 28.7%, slightly less than in 2006 (34.2%; P = 0.393); the penicillin-resistant serotypes 15A and 35B had increased. Serotypes 15A, 3, and 35B most often belonged to sequence types 63, 180, and 558. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are expected to assist in development of future vaccines, and they underscore the need for appropriate clinical choice of oral agents based on testing of causative pathogens.
