Reactive oxygen species are implicated in cell and tissue damage in a number of diseases including acute and chronic inflammation of the gut. Effects of H(2)O(2) exposure on non-carcinogenic porcine epithelial cell line, IPEC-J2 cells cultured on collagen-coated membrane inserts were monitored based on transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) change, extent of necrotic cell damage, gene expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and TNF-alpha. Furthermore, the junction proteins claudin-1 and E-cadherin were also investigated by immunohistochemistry. Peroxide (1mM) increased IL-8 and TNF-alpha gene expression levels significantly allowing 1 h recovery time without affecting the cellular distribution of junction proteins, TER and cell survival rate. In conclusion, the IPEC-J2 cell line on membrane insert was introduced as a fast and reliable investigation tool for oxidative stimuli-triggered intestinal inflammation and in the future as a screening method for antioxidant and probiotic candidates.
