This work reports, for the first time, the presence of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Moreover, this is the first report of the NDM-1 presence in the Balkan region. Cosmid gene libraries of carbapenem-nonsusceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates MMA83 and MMA533 were screened for the presence of metallo-beta-lactamases. Accordingly, both MMA83 and MMA533 carried the bla(NDM-1) gene. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis indicated that strains MMA83 and MMA533 belonged to different clonal groups. Five additional isolates from different patients clonally related to either MMA83 or MMA533 were found to be NDM-1 positive.
