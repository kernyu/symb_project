INTRODUCTION: Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS) is the most common agent in early neonatal sepsis. Strategies incorporating universal screening for maternal colonization show the lowest rates of perinatal infection. A significant increase in resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin by GBS has been reported around the world. There are no published data regarding prevalence and antimicrobial resistance in southern regions of Chile. Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance is essential to define the drugs of choice and alternatives, in an institution that applies prevention protocols, as Clinica Alemana Temuco (CAT) does. OBJECTIVES: to determine the prevalence of carriage of GBS in vaginal-anal areas at end of pregnancy, in CAT, Araucania Region, Chile. To determine the susceptibility to erythromycin and clindamycin of GBS strains isolated. RESULTS: 1,181 pregnant women were included; 167 were positive for GBS (14.4% of colonization). Sixteen were resistant to erythromycin (9.5%); 15 of these strains were also clindamycin resistant. Twenty-three of 167 were resistant to clindamycin (13.7%). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence rate of GBS colonization was lower than previously reported in other regions of Chile. Due to the high rates of resistance to clindamycin and erythromycin it is necessary to widen the study of susceptibility to other antimicrobials to have alternatives in allergy to penicillin (primarily cefazolin and vancomycin).
