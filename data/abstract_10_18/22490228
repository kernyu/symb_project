Reduced vancomycin susceptibility (RVS) may lead to poor clinical outcomes in Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia. We conducted a cohort study of 392 patients with S. aureus bacteraemia within a university health system. The association between RVS, as defined by both Etest [vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) >1.0 mug/ml] and broth microdilution (vancomycin MIC >/=1.0 mug/ml), and patient and clinical variables were evaluated to create separate predictive models for RVS. In total, 134 (34.2%) and 73 (18.6%) patients had S. aureus isolates with RVS by Etest and broth microdilution, respectively. The final model for RVS by Etest included methicillin resistance [odds ratio (OR) 1.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97-2.34], non-white race (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.42-1.07), healthcare-associated infection (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.32-0.96), and receipt of any antimicrobial therapy </=30 days prior to the culture date (OR 3.06, 95% CI 1.72-5.44). The final model for RVS by broth microdilution included methicillin resistance (OR 2.45, 95% CI 1.42-4.24), admission through the emergency department (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32-0.92), presence of an intravascular device (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.30-3.86), and malignancy (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.26-1.00). The availability of an easy and rapid clinical prediction rule for early identification of RVS can be used to help guide the timely and individualized management of these serious infections.
