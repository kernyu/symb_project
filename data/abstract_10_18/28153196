Peritoneal dialysis (PD)-related peritonitis remains to be one of the most frequent and serious complications of PD. In this study, existing literature has been reviewed on PD peritonitis caused by atypical organisms and antibiotic resistant organisms and their impact on patient outcomes. Although uncommon, delay in recognition of PD peritonitis caused by atypical organisms can lead to poor patient outcomes if there is a delay in diagnosis and implementation of appropriate treatment. There is also a large difference in prevalence of antibiotic-resistant infections across the world with variable impact on reported patient-level outcomes.
