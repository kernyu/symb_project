AIMS: To characterize the molecular diversity of class 1 integrons and antibiotic resistance (AR) genes of Enterobacteriaceae strains recovered from aquatic habitats in Jinan, Shandong Province, China. METHODS AND RESULTS: Six hundred and thirty-eight antimicrobial-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolated from wastewater were examined for class 1 integron. Of these, 293 were positive for the class 1 integrase gene intI1; among these, 34 gene cassettes and 29 AR genes were detected. Twenty-nine distinct gene cassette arrays were identified by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Seven strains harboring novel gene cassette arrays were subjected to further study, in which antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were determined, and the presence of other AR genes outside of the integrons was assayed. Several of the resistance determinants were found to be transferable by conjugation or transformation. CONCLUSIONS: This study established the assessment of class 1 integron and antimicrobial resistance gene patterns among environmental Enterobacteriaceae. Also, a restriction enzyme EcoRII was employed to develop a rapid and simple method for characterizing gene cassette arrays by RFLP analysis, which facilitated further study of novel gene cassette arrays. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: These data not only illustrated the diversity of class 1 integron gene cassettes but also provided direct evidence that integrons mobilized gene cassettes, generating new linkages of resistance genes, and they could be integrated in gene transfer units such as conjugative plasmids to contribute to the dissemination of AR genes by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in aquatic environments.
