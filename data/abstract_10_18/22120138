Drug resistance in food-borne bacterial pathogens is an almost inevitable consequence of the use of antimicrobial drugs, used either therapeutically or to avoid infections in food-producing animals. In the past decades, the spread and inappropriate use of antibiotics have caused a considerable increase of antibiotics to which bacteria have developed resistance and, moreover, bacteria are becoming resistant to more than one antibiotic simultaneously. Understanding mechanisms at the molecular level is extremely important to control multi-resistant strains and to develop new therapeutic strategies. In the present study, comparative proteomics was applied to characterize membrane and cytosolic proteome in order to investigate the regulation of protein expression in multi-resistance E. coli isolated from young never vaccinated water buffalo. Results highlighted differentially expressed proteins under multi drug resistance conditions giving new insights about mechanisms involved in resistance, as quorum sensing mechanisms, and suggesting possible novel bacterial targets to develop alternative antibiotic drugs.
