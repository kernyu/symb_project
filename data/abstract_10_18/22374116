Staphylococcus aureus is the most prevalent pathogen causing intramammary infections (IMI) in dairy cattle worldwide. New treatment regimens have been evaluated to increase cure rates. A systematic review was conducted to answer this question: what is the best antibiotic treatment for S aureus IMI of lactating cows in North America? Direct comparison between studies (n = 6) was difficult since there was no clinical trial comparing all antibiotics and large variations between study protocols and enrolment and outcome definitions were observed. The best therapeutic option currently available in North America is an extended intramammary therapy for 5 to 8 days.
