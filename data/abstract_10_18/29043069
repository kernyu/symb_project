Klebsiella pneumoniae, a gram-negative bacillus of the Enterobacteriaceae family, is a component of the normal human microbiota and a common cause of community- and healthcare-associated infections. The increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among K. pneumoniae isolates, particularly among those causing healthcare-associated infections, is an important public health concern. Infections caused by these multidrug-resistant organisms, for which safe and effective antimicrobial therapy options are extremely limited, are associated with poor outcomes for patients. The optimal approach to the treatment of infections caused by these multidrug-resistant strains remains undefined, and treatment decisions for an individual patient should be based on a number of organism- (for example, minimum inhibitory concentration) and patient-specific (for example, site of infection) factors. The emergence of pandrug-resistant strains of K. pneumoniae highlights the critical need for consistent implementation of effective strategies for prevention of transmission and infection and for the development of new antimicrobials with activity against these emerging pathogens.
