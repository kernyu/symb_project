A tributyltin (TBT) resistance gene was isolated from the TBT-resistant marine origin bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa 25W. This gene was identical to PA0320 deposited in the P. aeruginosa PAO1 database (http://www.pseudomonas.com). The deduced amino acid sequence of PA0320 appears to be homologous to the YgiW proteins of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. The deletion mutant of PA0320 showed a reduction of growth rate in the presence of TBT. A susceptibility test to cadmium, mercury, hydrogen peroxide and acidic pH in the deletion mutant showed an increasing susceptibility to them. PA0320 plays a certain role in stress tolerance against TBT as well as in stressors producing reactive oxygen species.
