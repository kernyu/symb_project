OBJECTIVES: We analysed the ability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates to penetrate and grow inside murine macrophages as a surrogate of fitness. METHODS: Thirty-five drug-resistant and 10 drug-susceptible M. tuberculosis isolates were studied in a murine macrophage model from the J774.2 cell line in a 6 day protocol, performing semi-quantitative counts in Middlebrook 7H11 medium. The mycobacterial penetration index (MPI) after infection and the mycobacterial growth ratio (MGR) inside the macrophages were determined to evaluate the fitness of isolates. RESULTS: Isolates with the katG S315T mutation and multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates had a significantly lower MGR compared with drug-susceptible isolates. The MPI of the isolates with the katG S315T mutation showed a significant decrease compared with the MPI of those without this mutation. A trend to significantly lower values was also observed on comparing the MPI of the MDR isolates with that of the drug-susceptible isolates and the isolates resistant to isoniazid. CONCLUSIONS: The isoniazid-resistant and MDR isolates with mutations in the katG gene showed decreased multiplication inside murine macrophages, suggesting a lower fitness of M. tuberculosis with these resistance patterns.
