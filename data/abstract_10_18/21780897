Important breakthroughs have been made in recent years into understanding the close interaction between hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and glucose homeostasis. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have demonstrated that infection with HCV is associated with an increased risk of developing insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes. A direct effect of HCV on hepatocyte insulin signaling has been shown in experimental models. Some preliminary observations seem to suggest that indirect mechanisms involving extrahepatic organs might also play a role. The interaction between HCV and glucose metabolism has significant clinical consequences. Insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes not only accelerate the histological and clinical progression of chronic hepatitis C, but also reduce the virological response to IFN-alpha-based therapy. Thus, understanding the mechanisms underlying HCV-associated glucose metabolism derangements is of paramount interest in order to improve the clinical management of chronic hepatitis C. This article will focus on the studies that consistently argue in favor of an interrelation between HCV and insulin resistance and will highlight the latest discoveries in this field.
