The emerging multiple drug resistance in bacterial pathogens is complicating the treatment of diseases and hence is a major public health concern. In the present study, Vibrio cholerae O1 El Tor Ogawa isolated from a patient was examined for antibiotic susceptibility pattern, presence of SXT and its transmissibility, associated drug resistance genes and variation in the int gene and the attP attachment site of SXT. The strain showed resistance to ampicillin, polymixin B, co-trimoxazole, trimethoprim, streptomycin, spectinomycin, furazolidone, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid. The sequencing of int, the SXT-specific integrase and attP attachment site indicated that it possessed a variant of SXT with trimethoprim (dfrA1), sulphamethoxazole (sul2) and streptomycin (strB) resistance genes. Its mobile nature was demonstrated by conjugation with rifampicin-resistant Escherichia coli. The emergence of such an isolate should be closely monitored because it will improve our understanding of the evolution of the multidrug resistance phenotype.
