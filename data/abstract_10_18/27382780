Streptothricins are a group of the earliest discovered antibiotics with broad antimicrobial spectrum, and have been used for crop protection. We reviewed the studies on streptothricin resistance, biosynthesis of the three components (streptolidine, carbamoylated D-glucosamine and poly beta-lysine chain) and chemical synthesis of streptothricins. The important aspects for future streptothricin researches were also discussed.
