Four hundred and thirty Salmonella isolates, recovered from various food-animal products, were tested for nalidixic acid resistance, plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance, and genetic relationship. One hundred fifteen isolates (113 Salmonella serovar Enteritidis and two Salmonella serovar Typhimurium isolates) of 430 (26.7%) Salmonella isolates exhibited nalidixic acid resistance. Polymerase chain reaction screening for qnrA, qnrB, qnrS, qepA (encoding fluoroquinolones resistance) and rmtB (encoding aminoglycosides resistance) showed that 5 (1.16%) isolates were positive for qnr- and qepA-type genes, and the aac(6')-Ib-cr gene was observed in two (1.7%) Enteritidis isolates concomitantly with qnrA or qnrB. The co-occurrence of qepA and rmtB in one Typhimurium isolate is noteworthy. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed a high genetic homogeneity of nalidixic-resistant isolates and the persistence of clonal clusters over 4 years in different regions in Tunisia and from various food-animal products. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of co-occurrence of qepA and rmtB in a Salmonella strain.
