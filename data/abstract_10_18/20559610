Acinetobacter baumannii are emerging as the causal agents of healthcare-associated infections. We describe arenal transplant recipient who developed bacteremia caused by multiresistant A. baumannii, which received a combination of tigecycline, colistin, and meropenem in continuous infusion. The clinical outcome was favorable. In this article we made a molecular study of this multiresistant strain. Our analysis reveals the presence of abla-OXA-72 gene,a class D of oxacillinase belonging to bla-OXA-40-like group,which constitutes the most disseminated familiy of carbapenemases in Spain. Thus, we found different susceptibility patterns of A. baumannii when we used different Mueller-Hinton agars with different manganese concentrations. Lastly, we explain the combination of these three antibiotics administered to increase microbiologic and pharmacodynamic yield.
