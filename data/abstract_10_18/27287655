New drugs offer options for patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB). We describe four individuals with DR-TB in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, with prior exposure to clofazimine who would benefit from access to delamanid (DLM). Without DLM, individual options are limited, and there is a risk of resistance amplification and both community and nosocomial spread of DR-TB.
