The objective of this study was to determine the antibacterial activity of individual medicines and containing sum of the phyto-extracts against the bacteria causing nosocomial infections in compare to antibiotics. In the investigation were involved four strains of gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter spp. Each object was investigated on antibiotic resistance using Kirby-Bauer diffusion method on 22 types of antibiotics. The objects of the study were: Sanguinarine, Chelerythrine and Berberine hydrochloride (of lab quality); essential oils and aromatic waters of Eucalyptus, Salvia and Lavanda. For determination their antibacterial activity was used Raits serological dilution method with adaptation. The results show that the antibiotic resistant bacteria did not rise in non-diluted and 1:1 diluted test-tubes. In 1:5 diluted test-tubes was observed a little turbidity and growth, as for in other test-tubes - intensive growth. The investigated phyto-medicines show the higher antibacterial activity than the antibiotics.
