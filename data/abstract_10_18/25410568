Forty domestic and travel-associated Campylobacter jejuni isolates were analyzed by profiling 7 pathogenic genes (cdtB, cadF, Cj0131, ciaB, racR, wlaN, and virB11) along with multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. cdtB, cadF, and Cj0131 were present in all isolates, whereas virB11 was not detected in either domestic or travel-associated isolates. ciaB was present in all domestic isolates and 94% of travel-associated isolates. The respective detection rates of racR and wlaN in domestic and travel-associated isolates were 94% and 71% and 35.3% and 23%, respectively. MLST analyses of the 40 isolates generated 25 different sequence types (STs). ST-443 (12 isolates) and ST-21 (8 isolates) were dominant among the domestic isolates; however, STs varied among travel-associated isolates. Nalidixic acid, tetracycline, and ciprofloxacin resistance rates of the 40 isolates were 100% (40/40), 95% (38/40), and 88% (35/40), respectively. Domestic isolates exhibited 2-fold higher ciprofloxacin, telithromycin, and chloramphenicol resistance rates than travel-associated isolates. These results indicate a diverse genetic background for travel-associated C. jejuni and suggest that this pathogen may be an important emerging public health threat to travelers.
