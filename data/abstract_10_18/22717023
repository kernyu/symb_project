The effects of a compound including the secondary metabolites of garlic, propyl thiosulphinate (PTS) and propyl thiosulphinate oxide (PTSO), on the in vitro and in vivo parameters of chicken gut immunity during experimental Eimeria acervulina infection were evaluated. In in vitro assays, the compound comprised of PTSO (67 %) and PTS (33 %) dose-dependently killed invasive E. acervulina sporozoites and stimulated higher spleen cell proliferation. Broiler chickens continuously fed from hatch with PTSO/PTS compound-supplemented diet and orally challenged with live E. acervulina oocysts had increased body weight gain, decreased faecal oocyst excretion and greater E. acervulina profilin antibody responses, compared with chickens fed a non-supplemented diet. Differential gene expression by microarray hybridisation identified 1227 transcripts whose levels were significantly altered in the intestinal lymphocytes of PTSO/PTS-fed birds compared with non-supplemented controls (552 up-regulated, 675 down-regulated). Biological pathway analysis identified the altered transcripts as belonging to the categories 'Disease and Disorder' and 'Physiological System Development and Function'. In the former category, the most significant function identified was 'Inflammatory Response', while the most significant function in the latter category was 'Cardiovascular System Development and Function'. This new information documents the immunologic and genomic changes that occur in chickens following PTSO/PTS dietary supplementation, which are relevant to protective immunity during avian coccidiosis.
