The emergent 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic brought into acute focus the problem of choosing the most effective anti-influenza drugs for successive influenza infection spreading control. Oseltamivir and zanamivir, influenza virus neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs), were recommended by the WHO experts for the treatment and prevention of influenza, including that caused by pandemic strains. A major concern regarding the use of specific antiviral compounds is the emergence of the drug-resistant strains. Oseltamivir carboxylate and zanamivir IC50 values were equal to 0.3-5.2 microM for the most of A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic strains and 1.6-8.6 microM for the strains of influenza B virus in cell-based ELISA assay (2009-2010 season). All the studied strains of influenza A(H1N1 ) pdm09 (151) and B (22) viruses were sensitive to NAIs (2009-2011 seasons). For the first time in Russia oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1) pdm09 influenza virus was isolated from the patient on the 5th day of a treatment course of this drug.
