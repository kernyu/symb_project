Septic arthritis and osteitis at the hand are associated with a high morbidity. Trauma is the major cause for these infections. In the majority of cases the fingers are involved. Causative microorganisms are predominantly Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. In addition, an increasing number of Gram-negative bacteria have been found in hand infections. As differential diagnosis, tumours and non-septic arthritis must be considered. Treatment includes surgical debridement, immobilisation and functional rehabilitation. Crucial for the surgical strategy are the virulence of the pathogens, the resistance of the patient and the location of the infection. If functional recovery cannot be expected, salvage procedures like arthrodeses and resection arthroplasties are sometimes required. Surgical treatment is sufficient in septic arthritis and osteomyelitis of the hand. However, to avoid permanent disability, rapid diagnosis and therapy are essential. This review describes our treatment concepts in septic arthritis and osteomyelitis at the hand.
