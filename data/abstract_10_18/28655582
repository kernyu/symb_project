BACKGROUND: Although Clostridium perfringens has been reported as a cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD), it is uncommon to detect this pathogen in clinical microbiology laboratories in Korea. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of C. perfringens toxin in patients suspected of having AAD. METHODS: A total of 135 stool specimens submitted to a clinical microbiology laboratory for C. difficile toxin assay were tested. We tried to detect both C. difficile and C. perfringens toxins using the Seeplex Diarrhea ACE Detection kit (Seegene, Seoul, Korea). We evaluated the prevalence of 10 bacteria and 5 viruses. RESULTS: A total of 40 Clostridium spp. were detected in 34 specimens (29.6%). The C. perfringens toxin was detected in 14 of 135 specimens (10.4%), while C. difficile toxin was detected in 26 specimens (19.3%). Other bacteria and viruses, including 8 Aeromonas spp., were detected in 15 specimens. All tests were negative in 92 of the 135 specimens (68.1%). CONCLUSION: Clostridium perfringens toxin is relatively common, and we should consider the possibility of its presence in patients suspected of having AAD, especially if C. difficile tests are negative.
