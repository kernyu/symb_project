BACKGROUND: Bacterial pyoderma is a frequent presentation in dogs. Despite the widespread availability of effective systemic and topical antimicrobial products, good clinical practice currently recommends avoidance of long-term use to mitigate the development of bacterial resistance. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the speed of resolution of clinical signs of bacterial pyoderma in dogs treated with a systemic antimicrobial agent with or without the use of an adjunctive spray with antimicrobial properties. ANIMALS: Twelve dogs with superficial bacterial pyoderma. METHODS: In this controlled and blinded study, all dogs were treated with oral cefalexin and a topical spray (PYOClean Spray) for 4 weeks. The spray was applied to one half of each dog's body, whereas a placebo spray was applied to the other half. RESULTS: Twelve dogs completed the study. Mean clinical scores were significantly reduced on spray-treated sites, for test product and placebo (respectively), by 47% and 34% at Week 1, 83% and 60% at Week 2, 95% and 82% at Week 3, and 100% and 96% at Week 4. Fifty percent of treated sites were considered clinically and cytologically cured at Week 2, 83% at Week 3, and 100% at Week 4 compared to 8%, 50% and 83% for the placebo sites, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: These results demonstrate that use of a topical spray which contains plant-derived essential oils and fatty acids, and compounds with antimicrobial properties (Manuka oil and N-acetyl cysteine) may help to speed resolution of pyoderma and may allow for shorter antimicrobial treatment time.
