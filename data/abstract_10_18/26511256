Vibrio parahaemolyticus is the most prevalent gastroenteritis-causing pathogen in Korea and in some other Asian countries. It is frequently found in oysters and other seafood. This study monitored changes in the prevalence of V. parahaemolyticus and environmental parameters in oyster aquaculture environments in Korea. From June to October 2014, we tested oysters (Crassostrea gigas) from shellfish-harvesting areas off the west coast of Korea. These 71 isolates were the sum of 16 (22.5%), 19 (26.8%), 23 (32.4%), and 13 (18.3%) isolates collected in July, August, September, and October, respectively. These 71 isolates had the following profiles of resistance against 16 antibiotics: all isolates were resistant to ampicillin and vancomycin, and 52.2, 50.7, and 50.7% of isolates exhibited resistance to cephalothin, rifampin, and streptomycin, respectively. PCR analysis for the presence of the species-specific toxR gene confirmed that 38 (53.5%) of the total 71 isolated strains were positive for V. parahaemolyticus. In PCR analysis for virulence of V. parahaemolyticus, of the 71 isolates tested in the present study, only 38 (53.5%) were positive for the trh virulence gene and 71 (100%) was negative for the tdh virulence gene.
