In recent years, the bacterium responsible for tuberculosis has been increasing its resistance to antibiotics resulting in new multidrug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB). In this study we use several analytical techniques including NMR, FT-ICR, TOF-MS, LC-MS and UV/Vis to study the copper-capreomycin complex. The copper (II) cation is used as a carrier for the antibiotic capreomycin. Once this structure was studied using NMR, FT-ICR, and MALDI-TOF-MS, the NIH-NIAID tuberculosis cell line for several Tb strains (including antibiotic resistant strains) were tested against up to seven variations of the copper-capreomycin complex. Different variations of copper improved the efficacy of capreomycin against Tb up to 250 fold against drug resistant strains of Tb.
