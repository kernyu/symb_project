The mithramycin biosynthesis gene cluster of Streptomyces argillaceus ATCC 12956 contains 34 ORFs and includes two putative regulatory genes (mtmR and mtrY), which encode proteins of the SARP (Streptomyces antibiotic regulatory protein) and PadR transcriptional regulator families, respectively. MtmR was proposed to behave as a positive regulator of mithramycin biosynthesis. Inactivation and overexpression of mtrY indicated that it is also a positive regulator of mithramycin biosynthesis, being non-essential but required to maintain high levels of mithramycin production in the producer strain. Transcriptional analyses by reverse transcription PCR and quantitative real-time PCR of mithramycin genes, and promoter-probe assays in S. argillaceus polyketide synthase and regulatory mutants and the WT strain, and in the heterologous host Streptomyces albus, were carried out to analyse the role of MtmR and MtrY in the regulation of the mithramycin gene cluster. These experiments revealed that MtmR had a positive role, activating expression of at least six polycistronic units (mtmR-mtmE, mtmQ-mtmTII, mtmX-mtmY, mtmV-mtmTIII, mtmW-mtmMI and mtmGI-mtrB) and one monocistronic unit (mtmGII) in the mithramycin gene cluster. However, MtrY played a dual role in the mithramycin gene cluster: (i) repressing the expression of resistance genes and its coding gene itself by controlling the activity of the mtrYp promoter that directs expression of the regulator mtrY and resistance genes, with this repression being released in the presence of mithramycin; and (ii) enhancing the expression of mithramycin biosynthesis genes when mithramycin is present, by interacting with the mtmRp promoter that controls expression of the mtmR regulator, amongst others.
