In this study, the performances of four methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) chromogenic screening media were compared for detecting mecC-positive MRSA. Using 111 clinical isolates representative of the various mecC-MRSA clones in Europe, chromID((R)) MRSA (bioMerieux) and Brilliance(TM) MRSA 2 (Oxoid Ltd.) showed higher sensitivity (99.1% and 97.3%, respectively) than BBL(TM) CHROMagar((R)) MRSA II (BD Diagnostics) and MRSASelect(TM) (Bio-Rad) (79.3% and 63.1%, respectively) (P <0.0001). These findings have important implications for effective public health diagnostics and epidemiological surveillance of MRSA.
