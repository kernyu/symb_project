BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common cause of otitis media (OM) in children; mastoiditis remains an important complication of OM. Limited data are available on the impact of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) on pneumococcal otitis. METHODS: Investigators from 8 children's hospitals in the United States prospectively collected pneumococcal isolates from middle ear or mastoid cultures from children from 2011 to 2013. Serotype and antibiotic susceptibilities were determined and PCV13 doses for children documented. RESULTS: Over the 3-year period, the proportion of isolates included in PCV13 (plus a related serotype) decreased significantly (P = .0006) among the middle ear/mastoid isolates (2011, 50% [74/149]; 2012, 40.5% [47/116]; 2013, 29% [34/118]). The number of serotype 19A isolates in 2013 (n = 12, 10.2% of total) decreased 76% compared with the number of 19A isolates in 2011 (n = 50, 33.6% of total). Of the children from whom serotype 19A was isolated (n = 93), 55% had previously received <3 doses of PCV13. The most common non-PCV13 serotypes for the combined years were 35B (n = 37), 21 (n = 20), 23B (n = 20), 15B (n = 18), 11 (n = 17), 23A (n = 14), 15A (n = 14), and 15C (n = 14). The proportion of isolates with a penicillin minimal inhibitory concentration >2 microg/mL decreased significantly over the 3 years (2011, 22% [35/154]; 2012, 20% [24/118]; 2013, 10% [12/120]; P < .02). CONCLUSIONS: The number of pneumococcal isolates and the percentage of isolates with high-level penicillin resistance from cultures taken from children with OM or mastoiditis for clinical indications have decreased following PCV13 use, largely related to decreases in serotype 19A isolates.
