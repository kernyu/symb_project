A total of 113 clinical Campylobacter strains (105 C. jejuni, 7 C. coli, 1 C. lari) were collected between 2006 and 2008 and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility to erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline and meropenem. Of all the Campylobacter isolates, 52.2% were resistant to ciprofloxacin and 38.0% to doxycycline. None of them was resistant to erythromycin or meropenem. However, 51.3% of all Campylobacter isolates were intermediate susceptible to erythromycin (minimum inhibitory concentration 1-4 mg/l). These data confirm the value of macrolides as the drugs of choice for the treatment of severe Campylobacter infections.
