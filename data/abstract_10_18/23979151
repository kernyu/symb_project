OBJECTIVE: To present the worldwide antibiotic resistance rates of uropathogens reported in nosocomial urinary tract infections (NAUTI) during the period of 2003-2010. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from the Global Prevalence Study of Infections in Urology from the period of 2003-2010 were analyzed to evaluate the resistance rates of pathogens causing NAUTI. The web-based application was used to record data of investigators from urology departments participating in the study every year during the days allocated in November. Each center was allowed to enter data on a single day of the study. The point prevalence data was used to find differences among geographic regions and years by utilizing multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 19,756 patients were hospitalized during the study period, and in 1,866 of them, NAUTI was reported. Proof of infection was reported in 1,395 patients. Resistance rates of all antibiotics tested other than imipenem against the total bacterial spectrum were higher than 10 % in all regions. Resistance to almost all pathogens was lowest in North Europe, and there is no single year where an outbreak of resistance has been detected. CONCLUSION: The resistance rates of most of the uropathogens against the antibiotics tested did not show significant trends of increase or decrease with Asia exhibiting the highest rates in general. The only antibiotic tested with an overall resistance rate below 10 % was imipenem. Knowledge of regional and local resistance data and prudent use of antibiotics are necessary to optimize antibiotic therapy in urological patients with NAUTI.
