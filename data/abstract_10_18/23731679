BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus infections are increasingly reported from both health institutions and communities around the world. In particular, infections due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains have been detected worldwide. If MRSA becomes the most common form of S. aureus in a community, it makes the treatment of common infections much more difficult. But, report on the current status of community acquired MRSA in the study area is scanty. METHODS: Community-based cross sectional study was conducted to evaluate the current prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of MRSA among primary school children and prisoners in Jimma town. MRSA was detected using Cefoxitin (30mug) disc; and epidemiologic risk factors were assessed using pre-designed questionnaires distributed to the children's parents and prisoners. A total of 354 nasal swabs were collected from primary school children and prisoners from December 2010 to March 2011 following standards microbiological methods. RESULTS: A total of 169 S. aureus isolates were recovered. The overall prevalence of MRSA among the study population was 23.08 % (39/169). Specifically, the prevalence of MRSA among primary school children and prisoners were 18.8% (27/144) and 48% (12/25), respectively. The isolated S. aureus and MRSA displayed multiple drug resistance (MDR) to 2 to 10 antibiotics. The most frequent MDR was Amp/Bac/Ery/Pen/Fox (resistance to Ampicillin, Bacitracin, Erythromycin, Penicillin, and Cefoxitin). CONCLUSION: The present study revealed that MRSA could be prevalent in the healthy community, transmitted from hospital to the community. The high distribution of MRSA could be favored by potential risk factors. Thus, for comprehensive evaluation of the current prevalence of MRSA and design control measures, consideration need to be given to the healthy community besides data coming from health institutions.
