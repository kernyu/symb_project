P-glycoprotein ( P-GP: , encoding gene Abcb1) and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein ( BCRP: , encoding gene Abcg2) are transport proteins that play a major role in modulating the bioavailability of oral drugs in humans and rodents. It has been shown that rifampicin is the typical inducer of P-gp in rodents by activating the nuclear receptor. However, its effect on Abcb1, Abcg2, CYP3A, and chicken xenobiotic-sensing orphan nuclear receptor ( CXR: ) mRNA expression in broilers is poorly understood. This study explored the effect of rifampicin on mRNA expression of Abcb1, Abcg2, CYP3A37, CXR as well as its effect on the pharmacokinetics of enrofloxacin in broilers. The mRNA levels of Abcb1, Abcg2, CYP3A37, and CXR were significantly increased in the liver (except Abcg2), kidney, jejunum, and ileum (P < 0.05) but not significantly changed in the duodenum (P > 0.05) after treated with rifampicin. Further analysis revealed that the variation tendencies of Abcb1, Abcg2, and CYP3A37 expression levels were significantly correlated with CXR mRNA expression levels in liver, kidney, jejunum, and ileum. Coadministration of rifampicin significantly changed the pharmacokinetic behavior of enrofloxacin orally administered by showing clearly lower AUC0-infinity, AUC0-t, and Cmax as well as longer Tmax. The bioavailability of orally administered enrofloxacin was decreased from 72.5% to 24.8% by rifampicin. However, rifampicin did not significantly change the pharmacokinetics of enrofloxacin following intravenous administration. Our study shows that rifampicin up-regulated the small intestinal level of P-gp and BCRP and suggests that P-gp and BCRP are key factors that affected pharmacokinetic behavior of orally administered enrofloxacin by limiting its absorption from the intestine in broilers.
