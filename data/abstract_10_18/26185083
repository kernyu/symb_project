The fungus Candida albicans is a major source of device-associated infection because of its capacity for biofilm formation. It is part of the natural mucosal flora and thus has access to available niches that can lead to infection. In this chapter we discuss the major properties of C. albicans biofilms and the insight that has been gleaned from their genetic determinants. Our specific areas of focus include biofilm structure and development, cell morphology and biofilm formation, biofilm-associated gene expression, the cell surface and adherence, the extracellular matrix, biofilm metabolism, and biofilm drug resistance.
