Clinical isolates (n = 55) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were screened for the extended spectrum beta-lactamases and metallo-beta-lactamases activities and biofilm forming capability. The aim of the study was to demonstrate the antibiofilm efficacy of gum arabic capped-silver nanoparticles (GA-AgNPs) against the multi-drug resistant (MDR) biofilm forming P. aeruginosa. The GA-AgNPs were characterized by UV-spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and high resolution-transmission electron microscopy analysis. The isolates were screened for their biofilm forming ability, using the Congo red agar, tube method and tissue culture plate assays. The biofilm forming ability was further validated and its inhibition by GA-AgNPs was demonstrated by performing the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy. SEM analysis of GA-AgNPs treated bacteria revealed severely deformed and damaged cells. Double fluorescent staining with propidium iodide and concanavalin A-fluorescein isothiocyanate concurrently detected the bacterial cells and exopolysaccharides (EPS) matrix. The CLSM results exhibited the GA-AgNPs concentration dependent inhibition of bacterial growth and EPS matrix of the biofilm colonizers on the surface of plastic catheters. Treatment of catheters with GA-AgNPs at 50 microg ml(-1) has resulted in 95% inhibition of bacterial colonization. This study elucidated the significance of GA-AgNPs, as the next generation antimicrobials, in protection against the biofilm mediated infections caused by MDR P. aeruginosa. It is suggested that application of GA-AgNPs, as a surface coating material for dispensing antibacterial attributes to surgical implants and implements, could be a viable approach for controlling MDR pathogens after adequate validations in clinical settings.
