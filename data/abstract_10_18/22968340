PURPOSE: Genetic variability of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is considered to be an important factor defining viral pathogenesis, persistence and resistance to treatment. The aim of the present study was to characterize HCV genetic heterogeneity within a hypervariable region 1 (HVR-1) before and during the early period of pegylated interferon alfa (PEG-IFN-alpha) and ribavirin treatment in correlation with treatment outcome. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study involved 24 patients treated with PEG-IFN-alpha and ribavirin whose sera were collected before (baseline) and at 7, 14, 21 28 and 56 day of treatment. HCV HVR-1 region was amplified by nested RT- PCR and subjected to SSCP (single strand conformational polymorphism) analysis. SSCP changes of HCV HVR-1 over time in each patient were compared to treatment outcome results. RESULTS: In 2/11 (18%) SVR+ and 8/13 (62%) SVR- treated patients, HVR-1 genetic changes manifested by new SSCP bands (new genetic variants) and were significantly more frequent in nonresponders (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that HCV HVR-1 variability during the early phase of PEG-IFN-alpha and ribavirin therapy may be predictive of treatment outcome.
