We analysed the trend of antibiotic resistance of community-acquired uropathogens over a 4-year period in a cohort of children with a first episode of culture-proven urinary tract infection presenting to the department of paediatrics at a large general secondary care hospital in the United Arab Emirates. Comparisons were made between 2 time periods: 2003-04 versus 2005-06 for 145 children aged 2 months to 12 years of age. Although some changes in resistance were observed for some antibiotics between the 2 time periods, the differences were not significant, nor were the trends, except for a significant increase in resistance to nitrofurantoin (from 5.4% to 35.6%), with a significant increasing trend over the 4 years.
