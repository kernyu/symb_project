Neisseria meningitidis can produce a TolC-like protein needed for secretion of FrpC but not efflux of antimicrobials. We now report that expression of the meningococcal tolC gene in a TolC-deficient strain of Escherichia coli can restore properties of alpha-hemolysis and antimicrobial resistance known to involve efflux pumps.
