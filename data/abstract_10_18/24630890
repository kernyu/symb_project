Bloodstream infections (BSIs) remain important causes of morbidity and mortality among solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients and still threaten the success of SOT. In general, among SOT recipients, risk factors for BSIs are associated with prior ICU admission, catheterization, older recipient or donor age...etc. Pulmonary focus, nosocomial source of BSIs, lack of appropriate antibiotic therapy and other variables have significant impacts on BSIs-related mortality in SOT. Most of BSIs in SOT are caused by gram-negative bacteria. However, all aspects including microbiological spectrum, morbidity and mortality rates, risk factors of BSIs and BSIs-related death depend on the type of transplantation. The purpose of this review is to summarize the epidemiology, microbiologic features including antimicrobial resistance of organisms, and associated risk factors for morbidity and mortality of BSIs according to different type of transplantation to better understand the characteristics of BSIs and improve the outcomes after SOT.
