C-terminal domain of peptidoglycan hydrolase enterolysin A (EnlA) is involved in specific recognition and binding to the target cell envelopes and represents true cell wall binding (CWB) domain. Sensitivity/resistance to EnlA is dependent on binding ability/disability of its CWB domain. We assume that main mechanism of resistance against EnlA is absence of the specific receptor on the cell surface, which is necessary for binding of the enzyme molecule. Using competitive and enzymatic assays we have uncovered the chemical nature of the EnlA receptor, which is a lipoteichoic acid.
