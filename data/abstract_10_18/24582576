Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen commonly identified from food poisoning-associated foodstuffs. From 1996 to the present, S. aureus isolates have been found to exhibit increasing resistance to antimicrobial drugs. The aim of this study was to assess the molecular epidemiology properties of various S. aureus isolates through molecular typing and to investigate their characterization based on their production of enterotoxins and hemolysins and their resistance to antibiotics. A total of 78 coagulase-positive staphylococcal strains isolated from food or clinical samples were analyzed. Eight VNTR loci were used to genotype the 78 isolates, and this analysis resulted in 39 different multilocus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) profiles. The isolates recovered from a single outbreak exhibited the same MLVA profile. According to CLSI, 97.4% of the isolates were resistant to penicillin, whereas only 3.8% were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains. Through multiplex PCR, 87.2% of the isolates were shown to be enterotoxigenic (SEs), and the most common genes present were sea, sem, seg, seu, and sek. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the prevalence of staphylococcal enterotoxins, the contents of virulent factors, and the characteristics of beta-lactam antibiotic resistance in 78 S. aureus isolates. These findings emphasize the need to prevent the presence of S. aureus strains and SE production in foods. Our results also demonstrate that MLVA is a useful and powerful method for epidemiological studies of S. aureus. In contrast to multilocus sequence typing, the MLVA method is a simpler and more rapid method for epidemiological typing with a higher discriminatory power.
