Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains with spontaneous mutations conferring resistance to rifampin (RIF) are exceedingly rare, and fixed drug combinations typically prevent augmentation of resistance to single drugs. Fourteen newly diagnosed tuberculosis patients were treated with RIF alone for 14 days, and bacterial loads, including mutation frequencies, were determined. A statistical model estimated that 1% of the remaining viable mycobacteria could be RIF resistant after 30 days of monotherapy. This indicates that temporal and spatial windows of RIF monotherapy due to uneven drug distribution within lung lesions could contribute to the acquisition of resistance to RIF.
