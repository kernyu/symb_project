We investigated antimicrobial activities of meropenem and other antibiotics against 164 isolates (41 Escherichia coli, 16 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 Enterobacter cloacae, 21 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 14 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), 18 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 47 Staphylococcus epidermidis) from blood of the patients admitted to Keio University Hospital between January and October in 2010. Meropenem showed the potent antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria especially and it maintained good broad spectrum antimicrobial activity including resistant strains through 13 years since when we started the investigation. These results indicated the validity of choosing meropenem as a first line antimicrobial agent for serious infectious diseases.
