Over the past several years we have obtained considerable evidence indicating that adenoviruses-expressing interferon alpha (Ad-IFNalpha) can overcome resistance to the IFNalpha protein itself. Since cancer cells infected with Ad-IFNalpha also show high perinuclear cytoplasmic IFNalpha expression, we were interested in whether endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and cleavage of caspase 4 could have a major role in Ad-IFNalpha-produced cancer cell death. Indeed, procaspase 4 was upregulated and cleaved as early as 12 h after Ad-IFNalpha infection of the cancer cells, which co-localized with IFNalpha staining and ER tracker. In contrast, immortalized normal human urothelial cells, although exhibiting similar perinuclear IFNalpha staining, showed no cleaved caspase 4. Caspase 4 cleavage was not blocked by the caspase 8 specific inhibitor zIETD, indicating that caspase 4 activation was independent of caspase 8 activation. Blocking caspase 4 also inhibited activation of caspase 3 in Ad-IFNalpha containing cells. Finally, the cleaved form of caspase 4 (p10) was detected in Ad-IFNalpha-positive cancer cells from the urine of a patient following intravesical Ad-IFNalpha/Syn3 treatment. Therefore, ER stress and activation of caspase 4 appears to be an important mechanism involved in the direct cancer cell death produced by Ad-IFNalpha and also occurs in the clinical setting.
