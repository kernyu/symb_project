OBJECTIVE: The Xpert MTB/Rif, with a detection limit of 131 CFU/ml, plays a valuable role in the diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, both susceptible and resistant. This study aims at evaluating the Xpert MTB/Rif for the same, at a tertiary care centre in south India, assessing it against both culture and a composite gold standard (CGS). METHODS: We tested consecutive samples from patients suspected of extrapulmonary tuberculosis with Xpert MTB/Rif, evaluated its sensitivity and specificity against solid and/or liquid culture and CGS. An individual analysis of different sample types (tissue biopsies, fluids, pus, lymph node biopsies and CSF) given an adequate sample size, against both culture and CGS, was also performed. RESULTS: In total, 494 samples were analysed against culture. Compared to culture, the sensitivity of Xpert MTB/Rif was 89% (95% CI 0.81-0.94) and its specificity was 74% (95% CI 0.70-0.78). When Xpert MTB/Rif was compared to the CGS, pooled sensitivity was 62% (95% CI 0.56-0.67) and specificity was 100% (95% CI 0.91-1.00). CONCLUSION: This assay performs better than the currently available conventional laboratory methods. The rapidity with which results are obtained is an added advantage, and its integration into a routine diagnostic protocol must be considered.
