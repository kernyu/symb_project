From 2003 to 2013, South Korea has conducted the National Antimicrobial Resistance Safety Control Program (NARSCP). The purpose of the current study was to systematically review national antimicrobial resistance (AMR) research trends and to provide guidance on future allocation of research funding to enable a comprehensive approach in AMR control. This study collected project reports related to AMR published by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, the Ministry of Health and Welfare and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between 2003 and 2013. These reports were analysed by topics based on the AMR action plan of the World Health Organization (WHO), period of study, categories along the research pipeline and types of receiving institution. A total of 198 project reports were included, with total funding of US$18.3 million. Mean funding per award was US$92,750, with a median of US$71,714. Among the WHO-suggested criteria, the basic microbial research and surveillance sector accounts for 143 (72.2%) of all awards. Yearly project funding increased from US$961,476 in 2003 to US$1,553,294 in 2013. Operational research was 61.5% and product development was 0.7% of the basic microbial research and surveillance sector. By institution, academia received 145 awards (73.2%). During progress of the NARSCP, total research funding increased significantly, but most awards were focused on understanding the overall picture of the nationwide AMR status. More balanced funding is needed, and encouraging active participation of private and international sectors is also required in reducing AMR.
