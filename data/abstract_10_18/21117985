Salmonella spp. are important zoonotic pathogens in humans and animals. A longitudinal study was conducted at the Iowa State University's campus (at the Dairy/Animal Science Education and Discovery Facility) to observe change in Enterobacteriaceae (specifically Salmonella) before and after the placement of dairy livestock. To our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluated environmental changes of Gram-negative organisms in a new dairy farm environment. Environmental samples were taken using drag swabs and immediately processed in the laboratory using phenotypic methods (replica plating, the BBL Crystal Identification System for enteric/nonfermenter organisms, and plating on specialized media/broths). Genotypic methods were also used (BAX PCR and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis). Organisms identified as Salmonella were sent to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory (Ames, IA) for confirmatory serotyping. Resistance to antibiotics (ampicillin, nalidixic acid, and tetracycline) was determined by replica plating of Enterobacteriaceae and Salmonella isolates using the guidelines of the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System and Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. The microflora of Enterobacteriaceae changed as cattle were introduced and as time progressed. Additionally, multidrug-resistant isolates began to appear immediately after cattle were introduced (multidrug-resistant isolates were rare prior to introduction of livestock). Variables such as temperature and humidity did not affect the proliferation of bacterial organisms. Seventeen Salmonella isolates were identified as Salmonella London and three isolates as Salmonella Montevideo. Based on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis-generated dendrograms, it is likely that 17 Salmonella London isolates and 3 Salmonella Montevideo isolates are clonal.
