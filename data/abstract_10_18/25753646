Ceftazidime-avibactam and comparator antibiotics were tested by the broth microdilution method against 200 Enterobacteriaceae and 25 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant to fluoroquinolones (including strains with the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase [ESBL] phenotype and ceftazidime-resistant strains) collected from our institution. The MICs and mechanisms of resistance to fluoroquinolone were also studied. Ninety-nine percent of fluoroquinolone-resistant Enterobacteriaceae strains were inhibited at a ceftazidime-avibactam MIC of </=4 mg/liter (using the susceptible CLSI breakpoint for ceftazidime alone as a reference). Ceftazidime-avibactam was very active against ESBL Escherichia coli (MIC90 of 0.25 mg/liter), ESBL Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC90 of 0.5 mg/liter), ceftazidime-resistant AmpC-producing species (MIC90 of 1 mg/liter), non-ESBL E. coli (MIC90 of </=0.125 mg/liter), non-ESBL K. pneumoniae (MIC90 of 0.25 mg/liter), and ceftazidime-nonresistant AmpC-producing species (MIC90 of </=0.5 mg/liter). Ninety-six percent of fluoroquinolone-resistant P. aeruginosa strains were inhibited at a ceftazidime-avibactam MIC of </=8 mg/liter (using the susceptible CLSI breakpoint for ceftazidime alone as a reference), with a MIC90 of 8 mg/liter. Additionally, fluoroquinolone-resistant mutants from each species tested were obtained in vitro from two strains, one susceptible to ceftazidime and the other a beta-lactamase producer with a high MIC against ceftazidime but susceptible to ceftazidime-avibactam. Thereby, the impact of fluoroquinolone resistance on the activity of ceftazidime-avibactam could be assessed. The MIC90 values of ceftazidime-avibactam for the fluoroquinolone-resistant mutant strains of Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa were </=4 mg/liter and </=8 mg/liter, respectively. We conclude that the presence of fluoroquinolone resistance does not affect Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa susceptibility to ceftazidime-avibactam; that is, there is no cross-resistance.
