The spread of extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE) in low-income countries, where the burden of neonatal sepsis is high, may have a serious impact on neonatal mortality rates. Given the potential for mother-to-child transmission of multiresistant bacteria, this study investigated the ESBL-PE rectal colonization among pregnant women at delivery in the community in Madagascar and estimated a prevalence of 18.5% (95% confidence interval, 14.5% to 22.6%). One strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated was also a New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) producer.
