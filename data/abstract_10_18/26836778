NS5B polymerase plays an important role in viral replication machinery. TMC647055 (TMC) is a novel and potent non-nucleoside inhibitor of the HCV NS5B polymerase. However, mutations that result in drug resistance to TMC have been reported. In this study, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, binding free energy calculations, and free energy decomposition to investigate the drug resistance mechanism of HCV to TMC resulting from L392I, P495T, P495S, and P495L mutations in NS5B polymerase. From the calculated results we determined that the decrease in the binding affinity between TMC and NS5B(L392I) polymerase is mainly caused by the extra methyl group at the CB atom of Ile. The polarity of the side-chain of residue 495 has no distinct influence on residue 495 binding with TMC, whereas the smaller size of the side-chain of residue 495 causes a substantial decrease in the van der Walls interaction between TMC and residue 495. Moreover, the longer length of the side-chain of residue 495 has a significant effect on the electrostatic interaction between TMC and Arg-503. Finally, we performed the same calculations and detailed analysis on other 3 mutations (L392V, P495V, and P495I). The results further confirmed our conclusions. The computational results not only reveal the drug resistance mechanism between TMC647055 and NS5B polymerase, but also provide valuable information for the rational design of more potent non-nucleoside inhibitors targeting HCV NS5B polymerase.
