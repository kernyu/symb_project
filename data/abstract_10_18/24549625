Antibiotic resistance (AR), the ability of a microorganism to withstand the effects of antibiotics, is a growing and increasingly serious global public health problem. Enzymatic activation of antibiotics though the production of beta-lactamase is one of the main mechanisms causing AR. Synthetic riboswitch containing aptazyme is constructed in E. coli to regulate the expression of beta-lactamase through small molecule-aptamer interactions, which sharply reduces the antibiotic resistance of the engineered bacteria.
