It has become increasingly apparent that the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the NADPH oxidase (Nox) complex is vital for cellular differentiation and signalling in fungi. We cloned and characterized an AaNoxA gene of the necrotrophic fungus Alternaria alternata, which encodes a polypeptide analogous to mammalian gp91(phox) and fungal Noxs implicated in the generation of ROS. Genetic analysis confirmed that AaNoxA is responsible for the production of ROS. Moreover, deletion of AaNoxA in A. alternata resulted in an elevated hypersensitivity to hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), menadione, potassium superoxide (KO(2)), diamide and many ROS-generating compounds. The results implicate the involvement of AaNoxA in cellular resistance to ROS stress. The impaired phenotypes strongly resemble those previously seen for the ap1 null mutant defective in a YAP1-like transcriptional regulator and for the hog1 mutant defective in a HOG1-like mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. The noxA null mutant was also hypersensitive to Nox inhibitors, nitric oxide (NO(.)) donors and NO(.) synthase inhibitors, implying a role of AaNoxA in the NO(.) signalling pathway. Expression of AaNoxA was activated by H(2)O(2), menadione, KO(2), NO(.) donors and L-arginine (a substrate for NO(.) synthase). AaNoxA may be able to sense and respond to both ROS and nitric oxide. Moreover, AaNoxA is required for normal conidiation and full fungal virulence. AaNoxA promoted the expression of the AaAP1 and AaHOG1 genes in A. alternata. Inactivation of AaNoxA greatly reduced the transcriptional activation of AaAP1 in response to ROS stress. Thus, we conclude that the regulatory functions of AaNoxA conferring ROS resistance are modulated partially through the activation of the YAP1- and HOG1 MAP kinase-mediated signalling pathways.
