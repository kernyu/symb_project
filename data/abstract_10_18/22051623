Resistance to anti-retroviral therapy is one of the main problems in the favorable outcome of treatment in HIV patients, as well as toxicity and adherence to treatment. Resistance has increased in recent years, and it is evaluated through genotyping and phenotypic tests. Information provided by these studies is crucial when deciding the most appropriate treatment. However, genotype interpretation is complex and subject to frequent change, because of the incorporation of new drugs and the appearance of new resistance patterns. This review aims ,understanding the fundamental concepts of antiretroviral resistance (ARV), which examines the general principles, mechanisms and patterns of resistance, both for the traditional family of anti-retrovirals, as well as for the most recently licensed drugs.
