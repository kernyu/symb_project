Accurate antimicrobial drug use data are needed to enlighten discussions regarding the impact of antimicrobial drug use in agriculture. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the perceived accuracy and clarity of different methods for reporting antimicrobial drug use information collected regarding beef feedlots. Producers, veterinarians, industry representatives, public health officials, and other knowledgeable beef industry leaders were invited to complete a web-based survey. A total of 156 participants in 33 US states, 4 Canadian provinces, and 8 other countries completed the survey. No single metric was considered universally optimal for all use circumstances or for all audiences. To effectively communicate antimicrobial drug use data, evaluation of the target audience is critical to presenting the information. Metrics that are most accurate need to be carefully and repeatedly explained to the audience.
