AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of the photodynamic therapy using hypericin (HYP) against both planktonic and biofilm-forming Staphylococcus aureus. MATERIALS & METHODS: HYP photoactivity was evaluated against methicillin-susceptible and resistant S. aureus. Bacterial suspension or biofilm were preincubated with HYP and subjected to LED illumination. Viable bacteria were determined by colony counting. RESULTS: Preincubation with HYP (5 min) plus light exposure (10 min) showed bactericidal effect against planktonic methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Longer preincubation times (24 h) and time light exposure (30 min) were required to reach HYP-photoactivity against S. aureus biofilms. HYP-photoactivity was correlated to the biofilm production. CONCLUSION: HYP could be a potential photosensitizer for the inactivation of staphylococcal biofilms forming on the surfaces accessible to visible light.
