The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) mutational archive of proviral DNA was monitored during a 72-week follow-up in 20 multidrug-experienced HIV-1-infected patients treated with a darunavir/ritonavir-based salvage therapy. At the beginning of the study, all patients harboured a number of intracellular drug resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In some patients, a significant fluctuation in the number of RAMs was observed during the observation period. However, all patients, notwithstanding the presence or the fluctuation of intracellular RAMs, showed a persistently undetectable viraemia. The data suggest that the archived resistant viral variants change during suppressive therapy, but that the variants are unable to re-emerge and to affect virological response.
