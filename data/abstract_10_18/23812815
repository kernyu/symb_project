We previously showed that the expression of ENO1 (enolase) in the fungal pathogen Candida albicans is critical for cell growth. In this study, we investigate the contribution of the ENO1 gene to virulence. We conducted our functional study of ENO1 in C. albicans by constructing an eno1/eno1 null mutant strain in which both ENO1 alleles in the genome were knockouted with the SAT1 flipper cassette that contains the nourseothricin-resistance marker. Although the null mutant failed to grow on synthetic media containing glucose, it was capable of growth on media containing yeast extract, peptone, and non-fermentable carbon sources. The null mutant was more susceptible to certain antifungal drugs. It also exhibited defective hyphal formation, and was avirulent in BALB/c mice.
