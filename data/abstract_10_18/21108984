Chickens were used to investigate plasma disposition of difloxacin after single intravenous (IV) and oral dose (10 mg/kg body weight (BW)) and to study residue depletion of difloxacin and its major metabolite sarafloxacin after multiple oral doses (10 mg difloxacin/kg BW, daily for 5 days). Plasma and tissue samples were analyzed using a HPLC method. After IV and oral administration, plasma drug concentration-time curves were best described by a two-compartment open model. Mean (+/- SD) elimination half-lives (t((1/2))beta) of difloxacin were 9.53+/-1.00 and 12.23+/-1.81 h after IV and oral administration. Maximum plasma concentration was 2.34+/-0.50 mug/ml and interval from oral administration until maximal concentration was 1.34+/-0.03 h. Oral bioavailability was found to be 68.89+/-15.21%. Difloxacin was converted to sarafloxacin. After multiple oral dose (10mg difloxacin/kg BW, daily for 5 days), mean kidney, liver, muscle and skin + fat tissue concentrations of difloxacin and sarafloxacin ranging between 604.8+/-132.5 and 368.1+/-52.5 mug/kg and 136.4+/-18.3 and 10.4+/-1.2 mug/kg, respectively, were measured 1 day after administration of the final dose of difloxacin. A withdrawal time of 5 days was necessary to ensure that the residues of difloxacin were less than the maximal residue limits (MRL) or tolerance established by the European Union.
