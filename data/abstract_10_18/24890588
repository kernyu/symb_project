A carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter pittii strain carrying an OXA-24-like enzyme was isolated in northern Spain in 2008. Sequence analysis confirmed the presence of the novel bla(OXA-207) gene flanked by the site-specific XerC/XerD-like recombination binding sites and showing a unique Gly222Val substitution compared to OXA-24. Cloning and kinetic analysis showed that OXA-207 presents a reduction in the catalytic efficiency against carbapenems and a noticeable increase for oxacillin.
