Research and development for novel substances possessing anti-infective activity have attracted considerable attention due to the escalating resistance towards conventional antibiotics. Therefore, the discovery and development of effective antimicrobial drugs with novel mechanism of action have become an insistent task for infectious diseases research programs. Triazole scaffold has been consistently rewarded as a promising versatile lead molecule with a pivotal position in modern medicinal chemistry. The literature reveals that this heterocyclic moiety has drawn attention of the chemists, pharmacologists, microbiologists and other researchers owing to its indomitable biological potential as anti-infective agents. The present communication is a cogent attempt to review the chemistry and antimicrobial activities of triazole derivatives reported in recent scientific literature. The biological profiles of these new triazole derivatives represent a fruitful matrix for further development as promising and superior anti-infective medicinal agents.
