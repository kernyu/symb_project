Since it is unknown whether beta-lactam antimicrobial agents can be used effectively against borderline oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (BORSA) with oxacillin MICs >/=4 mg/L, the in vitro bactericidal activity and pharmacodynamic effect of oxacillin against clinical BORSA isolates was evaluated. Time-kill experiments with oxacillin were performed and the results compared with those obtained with vancomycin, daptomycin and linezolid against BORSA with oxacillin MICs >/=4 mg/L and BORSA with oxacillin MICs </=2 mg/L. Furthermore, the effect of beta-lactamase production and plasmid profile analysis were taken into account to clarify responses to oxacillin. Oxacillin killing activity was attenuated against BORSA compared with ATCC 29213 since the pharmacodynamic parameters revealed that the potency of oxacillin was markedly reduced (c. ten-fold) against BORSA with oxacillin MICs >/=4 mg/L. pBORa53-like plasmid-containing BORSA with oxacillin MICs </=2 mg/L showed markedly more regrowth. In conclusion, oxacillin was non-effective in the eradication of either (i) BORSA with oxacillin MICs >/=4 mg/L or (ii) beta-lactamase-hyperproducing BORSA (MICs </=2 mg/L). Further investigation into beta-lactam dosing strategies against different BORSA strains is warranted in order to avoid possible therapy failure.
