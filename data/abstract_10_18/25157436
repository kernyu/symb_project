Escherichia coli EmrE is a small multidrug resistance protein encompassing four transmembrane (TM) sequences that oligomerizes to confer resistance to antimicrobials. Here we examined the effects on in vivo protein accumulation and ethidium resistance activity of single residue substitutions at conserved and variable positions in EmrE transmembrane segment 2 (TM2). We found that activity was reduced when conserved residues localized to one TM2 surface were replaced. Our findings suggest that conserved TM2 positions tolerate greater residue diversity than conserved sites in other EmrE TM sequences, potentially reflecting a source of substrate polyspecificity.
