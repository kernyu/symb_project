The PB1 C-terminal domain and PB2 N-terminal domain interaction of the influenza A polymerase, which modulates the assembly of PB1 and PB2 subunits, may serve as a valuable target for the development of novel anti-influenza therapeutics. In this study, we performed a systematic screening of a chemical library, followed by the antiviral evaluation of primary hits and their analogues. Eventually, a novel small-molecule compound PP7 that abrogated the PB1-PB2 association and impaired viral polymerase activity was identified. PP7 exhibited antiviral activities against influenza virus subtypes A (H1N1)pdm09, A(H7N9) and A(H9N2) in cell cultures and partially protected mice against lethal challenge of mouse-adapted influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus. Surprisingly, a panel of other subtypes of influenza virus, including A(H5N1) and A(H7N7), showed various degrees of resistance to the compound. Biochemical studies revealed a similar pattern of resistance on the impairment of polymerase activity. Molecular docking analyses suggested a PP7-binding site that appeared to be completely conserved among the subtypes of the virus mentioned above. Thus, we propose that alternative/additional binding site (s) may exist for the regulation of PB1-PB2 subunits assembly of influenza A virus.
