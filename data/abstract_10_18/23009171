The epidemiological role of monophasic Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium tends to increase, indicating pandemic spread. The aim of the present study was to confirm the occurrence of this serological variant in Poland and to report the first cases in Belarus and Ukraine. Genetic similarity of monophasic isolates with Salmonella Typhimurium already present in these countries was assessed. Serotyping, duplex-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, antibiotic resistance and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiling have been used to meet the study objectives. Monophasic Salmonella Typhimurium was found at low frequency in various sources along the food chain, including feed, animals, meat, and sewage sludge. The first isolates date back to 2008. The clones observed in other European countries were found, along with a number of new, unrelated genetic lineages appearing locally in three countries. Monophasic Salmonella Typhimurium is claimed to replace and discontinue the domination of pentaresistant Salmonella Typhimurium. Pigs and pork are assumed to be the main vectors of monophasic Salmonella Typhimurium, but their relevance for public health is limited.
