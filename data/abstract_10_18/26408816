The opportunistic Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa has a low susceptibility to common antibiotics. Additionally, around 15% of all clinical isolates bear acquired resistance genes. Thus, the development of new antibiotics to combat this pathogen in pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and bacteremia, represents an urgent task. The activity spectrum of the proline-rich antimicrobial peptide apidaecin 1b, originally isolated from honeybees (Apis mellifera), was extended in previous studies to further human pathogens including P. aeruginosa. However, the in vitro activity of the optimized peptide Api137 is limited to diluted medium conditions. Thus, we synthesized 323 analogs of Api137 on cellulose membranes using the SPOT strategy by substituting each residue individually by 19 other amino acids or deleting the residue. The peptides were deprotected with trifluoroacetic acid and cleaved with aqueous trimethylamine as C-terminal acids providing around 30 mug crude peptide per spot. This amount allowed determining the minimal inhibitory concentrations in a microdilution broth assay. The most promising substitutions were selected to synthesize 44 doubly and triply substituted Api137 analogs on the membrane. The 19 best peptides were synthesized at a larger scale and purified. Eight triply substituted Api137 analogs were up to 16-fold more active against P. aeruginosa at high medium concentrations without losing activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii and only slightly against Escherichia coli. The eight most active Api137 analogs were non-hemolytic to human erythrocytes and non-toxic to HeLa cells.
