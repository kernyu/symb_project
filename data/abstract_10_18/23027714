OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the association between ertapenem and antipseudomonal carbapenem use and carbapenem resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 12 hospitals in Queensland, Australia. METHODS: Data on usage of ertapenem and other antipseudomonal carbapenems, measured in defined daily doses per 1000 occupied bed-days, were collated using statewide pharmacy dispensing and distribution software from January 2007 until June 2011. The prevalence of unique carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates derived from statewide laboratory information systems was collected for the same time period. Mixed-effects models were used to determine any relationship between ertapenem and antipseudomonal carbapenem usage and carbapenem resistance among P. aeruginosa isolates in the 12 hospitals analysed. RESULTS: No relationship between ertapenem usage and P. aeruginosa carbapenem resistance was observed. The introduction of ertapenem did not replace antipseudomonal carbapenem prescribing to any significant extent. However, an association between greater usage of antipseudomonal carbapenems and greater P. aeruginosa carbapenem resistance was demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: It is likely that the only mechanism by which ertapenem can improve P. aeruginosa resistance patterns is by being used as a substitute for, rather than in addition to, antipseudomonal carbapenems.
