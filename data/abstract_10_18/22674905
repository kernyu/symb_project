The prevalence and clinical characteristics of bacterial pneumonia after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) have not yet been elucidated. We performed a retrospective analysis of 346 LDLT recipients. Fifty patients (14.5%) experienced bacterial pneumonia after LDLT, and they had a higher short-term mortality rate (42.0%) than patients with other types of bacterial infections after LDLT. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 84.0% of the causative pathogens. A multivariate analysis showed that preoperative diabetes (P < 0.01), United Network for Organ Sharing status 1 or 2A (P < 0.01), and an operative blood loss > 10 L (P = 0.03) were significant risk factors for bacterial pneumonia after LDLT. Post-LDLT pneumonia was associated with the following post-LDLT events: the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation (>/=3 days), a prolonged stay in the intensive care unit (>/=7 days), the creation of a tracheostomy, primary graft dysfunction, the use of mycophenolate mofetil, and the need for renal replacement therapy. Among patients with bacterial pneumonia, the mortality rate was higher for patients with delayed-onset pneumonia, which occurred at least 10 days after transplantation (n = 15), and it was significantly associated with graft dysfunction. A combination of broad-spectrum antibiotics and aminoglycosides provided cover for most gram-negative bacteria except Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, which was associated with a longer period of mechanical ventilation and was resistant to commonly used broad-spectrum antibiotics. Delayed-onset bacterial pneumonia is a serious type of bacterial infection after LDLT and is frequently associated with graft dysfunction. The multidrug resistance of S. maltophilia is an issue that needs to be addressed.
