The Verigene Gram-positive blood culture assay (BC-GP) is a microarray-based rapid diagnostic test, which includes targets for 12 bacterial species and 3 resistance determinants. We prospectively compared the diagnostic accuracy of the BC-GP to routine microbiologic methods and evaluated the potential of the BC-GP for antimicrobial stewardship programs. A total of 143 consecutive patients with Gram-positive bacteremia were included in the analysis. BC-GP correctly identified 127/128 (99.2%) of organisms from monomicrobial blood cultures and 9/14 (64.3%) from polymicrobial, including all methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Stewardship interventions were possible in 51.0% of patients, most commonly stopping or preventing unnecessary vancomycin or starting a targeted therapy. In Monte Carlo simulations, unnecessary antibiotics could be stopped at least 24 hours earlier in 65.6% of cases, and targeted therapy could be started at least 24 hours earlier in 81.2%. BC-GP is a potentially useful test for antibiotic stewardship in patients with Gram-positive bacteremia.
