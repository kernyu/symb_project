The aim of the present work was to describe mycobacteria species isolated in the antituberculosis center of Pointe-Noire city in Congo Brazzaville. It was a descriptive transversal study, conducted between September 2008 and April 2009 (7 months). A simple random sample was established from patients who came to the antituberculosis center of Pointe-Noire City (reference center on diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis). To those patients consulting with symptoms leading to suspect pulmonary tuberculosis, a sputum sampling in three sessions was conducted. Staining techniques to Ziehl-Neelsen and auramine were performed in Pointe-Noire. Culture, molecular hybridization and antibiotic susceptibility testing to first-line antituberculosis drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide or streptomycine) using diffusion method on agar were performed in Cerba Pasteur laboratory in France. In 77 patients, 24 sputum (31.20%) were positive to the microscopic examination and 45 (58.44%) to the culture and identification by molecular hybridization. Mycobacteria species complex isolated were M. tuberculosis with 31 cases (68.9%) and M. africanum with 3 cases (6.67%). Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NMT) were isolated in association or not with M. tuberculosis in 9 cases (20%) and the most common species were M. intracellulare. In M. tuberculosis species, 7 strains (41.20%) were tested sensitive to the first-line antituberculosis drugs, 8 cases (47%) monoresistance and 2 cases multidrug resistance at both isoniazide and rifampicine (12%) (MDR). This study showed the importance of Mycobacteria species complex and non-mycobacteria species in pulmonary tuberculosis. The data on resistance can help medical physicians in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. Another study with a large population is required to confirm these data.
