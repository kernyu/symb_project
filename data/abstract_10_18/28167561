Fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance is a major health concern in the treatment of tularemia. Because DNA gyrase has been described as the main target of these compounds, our aim was to clarify the contributions of both GyrA and GyrB mutations found in Francisella novicida clones highly resistant to FQs. Wild-type and mutated GyrA and GyrB subunits were overexpressed so that the in vitro FQ sensitivity of functional reconstituted complexes could be evaluated. The data obtained were compared to the MICs of FQs against bacterial clones harboring the same mutations and were further validated through complementation experiments and structural modeling. Whole-genome sequencing of highly FQ-resistant lineages was also done. Supercoiling and DNA cleavage assays demonstrated that GyrA D87 is a hot spot FQ resistance target in F. novicida and pointed out the role of the GyrA P43H substitution in resistance acquisition. An unusual feature of FQ resistance acquisition in F. novicida is that the first-step mutation occurs in GyrB, with direct or indirect consequences for FQ sensitivity. Insertion of P466 into GyrB leads to a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) comparable to that observed for a mutant gyrase carrying the GyrA D87Y substitution, while the D487E-DeltaK488 mutation, while not active on its own, contributes to the high level of resistance that occurs following acquisition of the GyrA D87G substitution in double GyrA/GyrB mutants. The involvement of other putative targets is discussed, including that of a ParE mutation that was found to arise in the very late stage of antibiotic exposure. This study provides the first characterization of the molecular mechanisms responsible for FQ resistance in Francisella.
