Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) have predominately involved infectious diseases physicians and pharmacists with little attention to the nurses. To achieve optimal success of ASPs, engagement of nurses to actively participate in initiatives, strategies, and solutions to combat antibiotic resistance across the health care spectrum is required. In this context, the experiences of local ASP teams engaging nurses in appropriate antimicrobial use were explored to inform future strategies to enhance their involvement in ASPs.
