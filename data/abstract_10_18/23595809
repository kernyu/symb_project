Quinolone resistance-determining region is known to be the druggability site of the target protein that undergoes frequent mutation and thus renders quinolone resistance. In the present study, ligands were tested for their inhibitory activity against DNA gyrase of Streptococcus pyogenes involved in DNA replication. In silico mutational analysis on modelled gyrase A revealed that GLU85 had the most possible interactions with all the ligands used for the study. The amino acid residue GLU85 had also been predicted with an essential role of maintaining the three-dimensional structure of the protein. When introduced with a mutation (GLU 85 LYS) on this particular residue, it had readily denatured the whole alpha-helix (from 80 to 90 amino acids). This was confirmed through the molecular dynamics simulation and revealed that this single mutation can cause many functional and structural changes. Furthermore, LYS85 mutation has altered the original secondary structure of the protein, which in turn led to the steric hindrance during the ligand-receptor interaction. The results based on the G-score revealed that ligands have reduced interaction with the mutant protein. The semisynthetic fluoroquinolone 6d, which is an exception, forms a strong interaction with the mutant protein and was experimentally verified using the antimicrobial test. Hence, the present study unravels the fact that mutation at the drug binding site is the major cause for different level of resistance by the S. pyogenes when exposed against the varying concentrations of the fluoroquinolones. Furthermore, a comparative assessment of quinolone derivative with the older generation fluoroquinolones will be of great impact for S. pyogenes-related infections.
