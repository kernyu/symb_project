BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, especially genotypes 1 and 4, is associated with wide metabolic disarrangements. AIM: To assess whether host metabolic factors influence sustained virological response (SVR) in patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 4 (HCV-4) treated with peginterferon / ribavirin and to evaluate the impact of antiviral therapy on insulin resistance (IR) and serum levels of adipocytokines. METHODS: Changes in levels of adiponectin, leptin, TNF-alpha and the homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) on antiviral combination in patients with HCV-4 were analyzed and effect on response was studied. RESULTS: 107 patients were included (M/F 86/21; mean age 41.4+/-5.6 years). Neither serum adipocytokines nor HOMA-IR was correlated with viral load. SVR was achieved by 57% of patients and was associated with fibrosis score (odds ratio: 6.5; P = 0.001) and adiponectin level (odds ratio: 1.3; P = 0.01). At the end of follow-up, HOMA-IR, adiponectin, leptin and TNF-alpha were reduced, all these changes unrelated to predicting the outcome of treatment. At follow-up, HOMA-IR and adiponectin continued to decrease in patients with SVR, but remained unchanged significantly in patients who did not response or relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Serum adiponectin at baseline appears to be an independent predictor for the achievement of SVR and can be utilized as an additional predictive marker. Changes of IR and adipocytokines occur under treatment which is more evident with the resolution of HCV infection, suggesting that HCV could have a direct role in these metabolic changes.
