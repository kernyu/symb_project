Antibiotic resistance is documented to be a serious problem that affects the choice of appropriate antibiotic therapy and increases the probability of unfavorable infection outcome. One of the proposed methods to cope with multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria is the use of alternative antibacterial treatments, which include natural antimicrobial substances such as plant essential oils (EOs). The aim of the present article is to review published studies on the activity of EOs and their constituents against MDR bacteria and to formulate perspectives for the future. In general, published studies indicate that EOs can be used as effective antiseptics against many species, including MDR bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, resistant isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and others; certain EOs may potentiate the effectiveness of antibiotics against MDR bacteria; EOs can be synergistic with bacteriophages; and polymeric nanoparticles can be used for delivery of EOs and enhancement of their activity at the site of infection.
