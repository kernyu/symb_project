Being perfectly adapted to diverse environments, chickweed (Stellaria media (L.) Vill), a ubiquitous garden weed, grows widely in Europe and North America. As opposed to the model plants, many weeds, and S. media in particular, have been poorly studied, although they are likely to contain promising components of immunity and novel resistance genes. In this study, for the first time RNA-seq analysis of healthy and infected with Fusarium oxysporum chickweed seedlings, as well as de novo transcriptome assembly and annotation, are presented. Note, this research is focused on antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), the major components of plant immune system. Using custom software developed earlier, 145 unique putative AMPs (pAMPs) including defensins, thionins, hevein-like peptides, snakins, alpha-hairpinins, LTPs, and cysteine-rich peptides with novel cysteine motifs were predicted. Furthermore, changes in AMP expression profile in response to fungal infection were traced. In addition, the comparison of chickweed AMP repertoire with those of other Caryophyllaceae plants whose transcriptomes are presently available is made. As a result, alpha-hairpinins and hevein-like peptides which display characteristic modular structure appear to be specific AMPs distinguishing S. media from Dianthus caryophyllus, Silene vulgaris, and Silene latifolia. Finally, revealing several AMPs with proven antimicrobial activity gives opportunity to conclude that the presented method of AMP repertoire analysis reveals highly active AMPs playing vital role in plant immunity.
