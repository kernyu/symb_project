Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole) is one of the antimicrobials of choice for the treatment of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infections. The analysis of mutants either lacking or overexpressing the efflux pump SmeDEF shows that this efflux pump contributes to intrinsic and acquired co-trimoxazole resistance in S. maltophilia. Since SmeDEF can extrude a variety of antibiotics, selection with such antimicrobials, including quinolones, might also select for S. maltophilia co-trimoxazole resistance.
