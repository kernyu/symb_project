The traditional antibiotic treatment for bacterial infections often induces antibiotic resistance in bacteria. In this work, we developed hybrid nanoparticles (NPs) with a self-antibacterial ability on Ti implants using monodispersed polystyrene-acrylic acid (PSA) nanoparticles as colloidal templates followed by the electrostatic adsorption of zinc oxide (ZnO) and the subsequent deposition of silica (SiO2) membrane on the outside. These synthesized PSA-ZnO-SiO2 NPs were pretreated by 5,5-dimethylhydantoin (DMH) before chlorination in a diluted NaClO solution. These nanoparticles (PSA-ZnO-SiO2-DMH) were subsequently labeled by N-halamines and then immobilized on the surface of titanium plates through hydrogen bonding. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were utilized to characterize the modified surface. Antibacterial tests disclosed that the PSA-ZnO-SiO2-DMH-Cl NPs modified surface exhibited excellent antibacterial activity against both Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P.au), Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). In vitro cell culture results revealed that PSA-ZnO-SiO2-DMH-Cl had no obvious cytotoxicity for an MC3T3-E1 preosteoblast. This novel surface system provides a promising self-antibacterial bioplatform for metallic implants without using antibiotics.
