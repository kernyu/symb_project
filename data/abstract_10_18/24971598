OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to analyze the transmission dynamics of ESBL positive Klebsiella spp. with an additional resistance towards gentamicin (ESBL-G) in a Dutch region of 650,000 inhabitants in 2012. METHODS: All patient related ESBL-G isolates isolated in 2012 were genotyped using both Amplification Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) and High-throughput MultiLocus Sequence Typing (HiMLST). HiMLST was used to analyze the presence of (unidentified) clusters of ESBL-G positive patients. Furthermore, all consecutive ESBL-G isolates within patients were studied in order to evaluate the intra-patient variation of antibiotic phenotypes. RESULTS: There were 38 ESBL-G isolates, which were classified into 18 different sequence types (STs) and into 21 different AFLP types. Within the STs, four clusters were detected from which two were unknown resulting in a transmission index of 0.27. An analysis of consecutive ESBL-G isolates (with similar STs) within patients showed that for 68.8% of the patients at least one isolate had a different consecutive antibiotic phenotype. CONCLUSION: The transmission of ESBL-G in the region Kennemerland in 2012 was polyclonal with several outbreaks (with a high level of epidemiological linkage). Furthermore, clustering by antibiotic phenotype characterization seems to be an inadequate approach in this setting. The routine practice of molecular typing of collected ESBL-G isolates may help to detect transmission in an early stage, which opens the possibility of a rapid response.
