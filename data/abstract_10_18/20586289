Cell respiratory activity of protoplasts obtained from the wild type of Neurospora crassa and photoreceptor complex WCC--white collar 1 (wc-1) and white collar 2 (wc-2)--mutants of Neurospora crassa strains was investigated. Respiration inhibition by KCN in the presence of 25 mM succinate was similar in all strains and did not exceed 83-85% against control. The significant induction of KCN-resistant respiratory pathway occurred under 1% glucose oxidation in wc-1 and wc-2 mutants if compared with the wild type strains. The inhibitors of the main (cytochrome) pathway of electron transfer in mitochondria-1 mM KCN and antimycin A (4 microg/ml)--blocked the respiration rate of the protoplasts from N. crassa wild type by 75%, while the cell respiration of wc-1 and wc-2 strains was suppressed by approximately 50%. The specific inhibitor of alternative oxidase--10 mM salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM)-in combination with the blockers of mitochondrial electron transfer chain caused the total suppression of respiratory activity of protoplasts in all studied strains. It is supposed that an increase of KCN-resistance in WCC mutants under glucose oxidation is connected with alternative oxidase activation as the result of failure in reception and signal transduction of active oxygen species.
