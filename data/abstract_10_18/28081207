INTRODUCTION: Interferon-beta (IFNss) is the first-line treatment for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) is a marker of IFNss bioactivity, which may be reduced by neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against IFNss. The aim of the study was to analyze the kinetics of MxA mRNA expression during long-term IFNbeta treatment and assess its predictive value. METHODS: A prospective, observational, open-label, non-randomized study was designed in multiple sclerosis patients starting IFNss treatment. MxA mRNA was assessed prior to initiation of IFNss therapy and every three months subsequently. NAbs were assessed every six months. Assessment of relapses was scheduled every three months during 24 months of follow up. The disease activity was correlated to the pretreatment baseline MxA mRNA value. In NAb negative patients, clinical status was correlated to MxA mRNA values. RESULTS: 119 patients were consecutively enrolled and 107 were included in the final analysis. There was no correlation of MxA mRNA expression levels between baseline and month three. Using survival analysis, none of the selected baseline MxA mRNA cut off points allowed prediction of time to first relapse on the treatment. In NAb negative patients, mean MxA mRNA levels did not significantly differ in patients irrespective of relapse status. CONCLUSION: Baseline MxA mRNA does not predict the response to IFNss treatment or the clinical status of the disease and the level of MxA mRNA does not correlate with disease activity in NAb negative patients.
