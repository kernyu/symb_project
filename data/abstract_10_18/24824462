We present the case of a 65-year-old patient with superficial carcinoma of the bladder who developed systemic inflammatory reaction as a result of a severe disseminated infection with M. bovis BCG after intravesical instillation of BCG. Besides the recommended antituberculosis therapy, considering the resistance of M. bovis to PZA, we discuss here the option of using steroids in the therapeutic management of this patient.
