We here report on the activity of 2'-C-methylcytidine (2CMC) [a nucleoside polymerase inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus (HCV)] on the in vitro replication of (murine) norovirus (MNV). 2CMC inhibits (i) virus-induced CPE formation, (ii) viral RNA synthesis and (iii) infectious progeny formation with EC(50) values of approximately 2muM. 2CMC acts at a time-point that coincides with the onset of viral RNA synthesis. Even following 30 passages of selective pressure no MNV-resistant virus was selected, which is in line with the high barrier to resistance of the nucleoside analogue for HCV. When combined with the broad-spectrum RNA virus inhibitor ribavirin, a marked antagonistic activity was observed indicating that these molecules should not be combined for the treatment of norovirus infections. Our results suggest that 2'-C-methyl nucleoside analogues should be further explored for the treatment and prophylaxis of norovirus infections.
