The present investigation was carried out to study the vancomycin resistance pattern of Staphylococcus aureus isolates (n = 274) obtained from 352 milk samples of bovine (269) and caprine (63) clinical and subclinical mastitis from different districts of West Bengal, India. Of them, seven isolates (vancomycin-resistant S. aureus [VRSA] 1-7) exhibited resistance to vancomycin. Minimum inhibitory concentration of vancomycin (MICvan) for VRSA2 and VRSA3 was >/=16 mug/ml; thus categorized as VRSA. For rest of the isolates, MICvan was 8 mug/ml and they were grouped as vancomycin intermediate S. aureus (VISA). Even though all the isolates were resistant to cefoxitin and oxacillin and possessed mecA gene, none of them carried vancomycin resistance gene. Furthermore, all the seven isolates were subjected to Staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing, Staphylococcal protein A (spa) typing, and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus polymerase chain reaction. All the isolates except VRSA3 and VRSA4 from Kolkata district exhibited diverse genetic lineage, irrespective of their host and antibiotic resistance pattern. These two isolates showed clonal similarity (MRSA-SCCmec-V-spa t267) with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains previously reported in human and animal infection. Isolation of VRSA and VISA could probably be due to intensive use of vancomycin in healthcare premises, which might have led to the development of glycopeptide-resistant strains and thereafter, further disseminated in the environment, including livestock farms. Detection of VRSA in milk is a serious concern as it may further cause health problems in the consumers. This is the first ever report of VRSA in food animals, even though the pathogen is otherwise prevalent in humans.
