In this study, N-doped ZnO/TiO2 core-shell nanocomposite was successfully sonosynthesized and sonofabricated on wool fabric through a facile one-step method under ambient pressure and low temperature (75-80 degrees C) as a novel photo-catalyst nanocomposite on textile material. The differences between crystalline phase transformation of conventional and ultrasound synthesized N-ZnO/TiO2 has been compared. The influence of different zinc acetate and titanium isopropoxide precursors in the formation of nanocomposite was studied and optimized through response surface methodology. The photocatalytic activity of the sonofabricated catalyst on the wool fabric surface was evaluated through decomposition of Methylene Blue as a model compound under sunlight irradiation. Also, N-doped ZnO/TiO2 nanocomposite sonosynthesized on wool fabric led to photo bleaching of wool fabric due to decomposition of the naturally occurred pigments under daylight irradiation. Further, yellowness index, antibacterial and antifungal activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans, cell viability, char residual, alkali solubility, mechanical properties and water drop absorption time on the treated wool fabrics were evaluated. Also, the acid solubility of the synthesized nanopowder obtained from sonobath after treatment was characterized in acetic acid indicating higher acid resistance on N-doped ZnO/TiO2 nanocomposite.
