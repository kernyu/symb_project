We analyzed the drift in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of glycopeptides and linezolid against 793 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and 4696 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates from Chinese children. For vancomycin and teicoplanin, no significant change occurred in different years for MIC values >/= 2 mug/mL, either in MRSA or MSSA. For linezolid, there was an MIC drift in MRSA and in MSSA.
