SUMMARY Following the recognition of a mecC MRSA isolate from a patient hospitalized in the northeastern region of Slovenia, a national collection of 395 community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) isolates from 2006 to 2013 was screened. An additional six mecC MRSA strains were found and characterized as spa types t843, t9397 and t10009, and multilocus sequence type ST130. The low oxacillin minimum inhibitory concentrations and absence of the mecA gene make recognition of these MRSA strains problematical for diagnostic laboratories. In such strains the presence of mecC should be determined.
