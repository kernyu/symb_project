Pouchitis is a common complication of restorative proctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis, and a proportion of patients develop a refractory course. The treatment of chronic antibiotic-refractory pouchitis (CARP) is challenging, and treatment failure is often a cause of pouch excision. We report on a series of three patients with CARP who were treated with oral ertapenem following faecal coliform sensitivity testing. There was an improvement in the pouchitis disease activity index in all three patients [pretreatment pouch disease activity index, median 13 (range: 10-14); post-treatment pouch disease activity index, median 1 (range: 1-3)]. Identification of faecal coliform sensitivity and treatment with oral ertapenem might be helpful in patients with CARP.
