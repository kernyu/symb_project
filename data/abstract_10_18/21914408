OBJECTIVE: To find out the frequency and susceptibility pattern of multi-drug resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa in clinical specimens. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Microbiology, Army Medical College, National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), Rawalpindi, from January to September 2010. METHODOLOGY: Routine clinical specimens were subjected to standard microbiological procedures and the isolates were identified to the species level. The antibiotics susceptibility was determined by Kirby Bauer Disc diffusion method and the results were interpreted according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. RESULTS: The frequency of MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa among all the Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated was found to be 22.7%. These isolates were most sensitive to Colistin followed by Piperacillin-Tazobactam and Cefoperazone-Sulbactum. CONCLUSION: Increasing fequency of infections due to MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an emerging threat in our set up which an be prevented by prescribing antibiotics judiciously and by adopting proper disinfection measures.
