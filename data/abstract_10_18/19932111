Helminth infections are an important constraint on the health and development of poor children and adults. Anthelmintic treatment programmes provide a safe and effective response, and increasing numbers of people are benefitting from these public health initiatives. Despite decades of clinical experience with anthelmintics for the treatment of human infections, relatively little is known about their clinical pharmacology. All of the drugs were developed initially in response to the considerable market for veterinary anthelmintics in high- and middle-income countries. In contrast, the greatest burden caused by these infections in humans is in resource-poor settings and as a result there has been insufficient commercial incentive to support studies on how these drugs work in humans, and how they should best be used in control programmes. The advent of mass drug administration programmes for the control of schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis and soil-transmitted helminthiases in humans increases the urgency to better understand and better monitor drug resistance, and to broaden the currently very narrow range of available anthelmintics. This provides fresh impetus for developing a comprehensive research platform designed to improve our understanding of these important drugs, in order to bring the scientific knowledge base supporting their use to a standard equivalent to that of drugs commonly used in developed countries. Furthermore, a better understanding of their clinical pharmacology will enable improved therapy and could contribute to the discovery of new products.
