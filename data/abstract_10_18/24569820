OBJECTIVE: Data are limited for comparison of the long-term efficacy of telbivudine (LdT) between hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related compensated and decompensated cirrhosis. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of LdT in treatment-naive patients with HBV-related compensated and decompensated cirrhosis in 96 weeks. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the data of 65 compensated and 62 decompensated cirrhotic patients treated with LdT for 96 weeks, and compared the difference in the related indicators before and after treatment between the groups. RESULTS: Alanine aminotransferase normalized rate was significantly higher in the compensated group than in the decompensated group at weeks 12 and 24 (67.7 vs. 40.3% and 78.5 vs. 53.2%, respectively, P<0.01). Albumin level was much higher than the baseline at week 24 in the compensated group (35.1+/-6.2 vs. 39.9+/-5.1, P<0.01), but significance was observed from week 48 onwards in the decompensated group (29.8+/-3.7 vs. 33.7+/-3.8, P<0.05). The Child-Turcotte-Puge score either improved or remained steady in both groups. The HBV DNA negativity rate at week 12 (56.9 vs. 32.3%, P<0.01) was higher, whereas the drug resistance rate was lower (P>0.05), in the compensated group than in the decompensated group. The degree of esophageal varix was alleviated, including 11 (16.9%) compensated and four (6.5%) decompensated cirrhotic patients. Liver stiffness was significantly decreased in the compensated group compared with the baseline [19.1 (7.3-32.6) vs. 14.8 (7.4-32.5), P<0.01]; however, there was no statistical significance in the decompensated group compared with the baseline [30.5 (9.1-55.0) vs. 29.9 (8.4-53.2), P>0.05]. CONCLUSION: Long-term LdT treatment showed superior virological, biochemical, and clinical efficacy in the compensated cirrhotic patients. Therefore, we emphasized the importance of early antiviral treatment, which may improve the prognosis of cirrhotic patients.
