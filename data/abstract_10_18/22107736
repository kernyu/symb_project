HIV-1 integrase (IN) is a validated therapeutic target for the treatment of AIDS. However, the emergence of resistance to raltegravir, the sole marketed FDA-approved IN inhibitor, emphasizes the need to develop second-generation inhibitors that retain efficacy against clinically relevant IN mutants. We report herein bicyclic hydroxy-1H-pyrrolopyridine-triones as a new family of HIV-1 integrase inhibitors that were efficiently prepared using a key 'Pummerer cyclization deprotonation cycloaddition' cascade of imidosulfoxides. In in vitro HIV-1 integrase assays, the analogs showed low micromolar inhibitory potencies with selectivity for strand transfer reactions as compared with 3'-processing inhibition. A representative inhibitor (5e) retained most of its inhibitory potency against the three major raltegravir-resistant IN mutant enzymes, G140S/Q148H, Y143R, and N155H. In antiviral assays employing viral vectors coding these IN mutants, compound 5e was approximately 200- and 20-fold less affected than raltegravir against the G140S/Q148H and Y143R mutations, respectively. Against the N155H mutation, 5e was approximately 10-fold less affected than raltegravir. Thus, our new compounds represent a novel structural class that may be further developed to overcome resistance to raltegravir, particularly in the case of the G140S/Q148H mutations.
