Chronic low-grade inflammation of adipose tissue plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of obesity. Immunohistological microscopic analysis in obese fat tissue has demonstrated the infiltration of several immune cells such as macrophages, but dynamics of immune cells have not been fully elucidated and clarified. Here, by using intravital multiphoton imaging technique, to our knowledge for the first time, we analyzed and visualized the inflammatory processes in adipose tissue under high-fat and high-sucrose (HF/HS) diet with lysozyme M-EGFP transgenic (LysM(EGFP)) mice whose EGFP was specifically expressed in the myelomonocytic lineage. Mobility of LysM(EGFP)-positive macrophages was shown to be activated just 5 d after HF/HS diet, when the distinct hypertrophy of adipocytes and the accumulation of macrophages still have not become prominent. Significant increase of S100A8 was detected in mature adipocyte fraction just 5 d after HF/HS diet. Recombinant S100A8 protein stimulated chemotactic migration in vitro and in vivo, as well as induced proinflammatory molecules, both macrophages and adipocytes, such as TNF-alpha and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2. Finally, an antibody against S100A8 efficiently suppressed the HF/HS diet-induced initial inflammatory change, i.e., increased mobilization of adipose LysM(EGFP)-positive macrophages, and ameliorated HF/HS diet-induced insulin resistance. In conclusion, time-lapse intravital multiphoton imaging of adipose tissues identified the very early event exhibiting increased mobility of macrophages, which may be triggered by increased expression of adipose S100A8 and results in progression of chronic inflammation in situ.
