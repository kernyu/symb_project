Two mutants (tri6Delta and noxABDelta) of the fungal pathogen Fusarium graminearum were assessed for their ability to prime immune responses in wheat (cv. Roblin) against challenge with pathogenic F. graminearum. Priming treatments generated Fusarium head blight (FHB)-resistant wheat phenotypes and reduced the accumulation of fungal mycotoxins in infected tissues. Microarray analysis identified 260 transcripts that were differentially expressed during the priming period. Expression changes were observed in genes associated with immune surveillance systems, signalling cascades, antimicrobial compound production, oxidative burst, secondary metabolism, and detoxification and transport. Specifically, genes related to jasmonate, gibberellin and ethylene biosynthesis exhibited differential expression during priming. In addition, the induction of the phenylpropanoid pathways that lead to flavonoid, coumarin and hydroxycinnamic acid amide accumulation was also observed. This study highlights the utility of nonpathogenic mutants to both elicit and delineate stages of defence responses in wheat.
