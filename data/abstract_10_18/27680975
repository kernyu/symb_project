Increased proliferation of antimicrobial resistance and new strains of bacterial pathogens severely impact current health, environmental, and technological developments, demanding design of novel, highly efficient antibacterial agents. Ag, Cu monometallic and Ag/Cu bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) were in situ grown on the surface of graphene, which was produced by chemical vapor deposition using ferrocene as precursor and further functionalized to introduce oxygen-containing surface groups. The antibacterial performance of the resulting hybrids was evaluated against Escherichia coli cells and compared through a series of parametrization experiments of varying metal type and concentration. It was found that both Ag- and Cu-based monometallic graphene composites significantly suppress bacterial growth, yet the Ag-based ones exhibit higher activity compared to that of their Cu-based counterparts. Compared with well-dispersed colloidal Ag NPs of the same metal concentration, Ag- and Cu-based graphene hybrids display weaker antibacterial activity. However, the bimetallic Ag/CuNP-graphene hybrids exhibit superior performance compared to that of all other materials tested, i.e., both the monometallic graphene structures as well as the colloidal NPs, achieving complete bacterial growth inhibition at all metal concentrations tested. This striking performance is attributed to the synergistic action of the combination of the two different metals that coexist on the surface as well as the enhancing role of the graphene support.
