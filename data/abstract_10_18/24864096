Meropenem is the first representative of carbapenem analogues with methyl group, which has been applied in medicine. This drug has been approved by FDA (Food and Drug Administration) in 1996. Available results of clinical trials and scientific reports point surprising synergism of combination of meropenem with other chemotherapeutics, in the treatment of bacterial diseases. Present study based on available information presents indications for use the mentioned antibiotic in pharmacotherapy of infectious diseases. Meropenem is the first representative of carbapenem analogues, which contains methyl group. Introduction of a methyl group at the system of coupled rings: beta-lactam and pyrrolidine, solved the problem of degradation by the dehydropeptidase-I (DHP-I). In the consequence it is not necessary to use meropenem in the connection with specific DHP-I inhibitors. Meropenem, similarly to other carbapanem analogues, is intended for the treatment of severe inpatient and outpatient infections. Bacterial resistance to meropenem may be the result of: carbapenemases activity, decreased affinity to Penicillin Binding Proteins--PBP (mainly PBP 2 and PBP 3) and activation of efflux pump (antibiotic ejection outside the cell). Twenty-year period of application of meropenem in pharmacotherapy may cause the spread of methyl-beta-lactamases.
