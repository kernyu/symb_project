Increasing industrialization and use of antimicrobial agents in aquaculture production, have led to heavy metals and multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens becoming serious problems. These resistances are conferred in two ways: intrinsic and transfer via conjugation, or transformation by the major transmission mediators. Integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) are one of the major mediators; however, few studies on ICEs of environmental origin have been reported in Asia. Herein, we determined the prevalence, antimicrobial susceptibility, heavy metal resistance and genotypes of 126 strains of Vibrio cholerae isolated from aquatic products and the environment in Shanghai, China. 92.3% of isolates were ICEs-positive from aquaculture water and 89.3% of isolates from shrimp showed MDR. Tracing the V. cholerae genotypes, showed no significant relevance of genotype among the antimicrobial resistance strains bearing the ICEs or not. Thus, in aquaculture, ICEs are not the major transmission mediators of resistance to antibiotics or heavy metals.
