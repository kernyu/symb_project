Two colistin-resistant Escherichia coli strains were characterized, which are FS13Z2S and FS3Z6C possessing chromosome encoded mcr-1 isolated from swine. Whole genome sequencing revealed that mcr-1 was in triplicate in the chromosome with another copy encoded on a pHNSHP45-2-like IncHI2 plasmid in strain FS13Z2S, whereas in strain FS3Z6C, only one copy mcr-1 was inserted in chromosome. It seems likely that the triplication of chromosome copies of mcr-1 in FS13Z2S is due to intra-molecular transposition events via a composite transposon containing a mcr-1 cassette bracketed by two copies of ISApl1, and the pap2 gene at the insertion site was truncated by an IS1294-like element. In plasmid pFS13Z2S and chromosome of strain FS3Z6C, only single copy of ISApl1 was present upstream of the mcr-1 cassette. The two strains exhibited a similar colistin MIC and are featured with PEA-addition to lipid A, without regard to the copy number variations of mcr-1. The mcr-1-harbouring plasmid was unstable in the wild-type strain FS13Z2S and was quickly lost after 7 days passage on colistin-free LB broth containing 0.5% SDS but the mcr-1 copies on the chromosome persisted. These results revealed that the single copy mcr-1 could result in modifying LPS and cause colistin resistance in E. coli. Acquisition of multiple copies of mcr-1, especially on the chromosome, would facilitate its stable persistence of colistin resistance in the host strain.
