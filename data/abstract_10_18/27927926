Antimicrobial susceptibility results from broth microdilution MIC testing of 993 Staphylococcus lugdunensis isolates recovered from patients at a tertiary care medical center from 2008 to 2015 were reviewed. Ninety-two oxacillin-susceptible isolates were selected to assess the accuracy of penicillin MIC testing, the penicillin disk diffusion test, and three beta-lactamase tests, including the cefoxitin-induced nitrocefin test, penicillin cloverleaf assay, and penicillin disk zone edge test. The results of all phenotypic tests were compared to the results of blaZ PCR. The medical records of 62 patients from whom S. lugdunensis was isolated, including 31 penicillin-susceptible and 31 penicillin-resistant strains, were retrospectively reviewed to evaluate the clinical significance of S. lugdunensis isolation, the antimicrobial agents prescribed, if any, and the clinical outcome. MIC testing revealed that 517/993 (52.1%) isolates were susceptible to penicillin and 946/993 (95.3%) were susceptible to oxacillin. The induced nitrocefin test was 100% sensitive and specific for the detection of beta-lactamase compared to the blaZ PCR results, whereas the penicillin disk zone edge and cloverleaf tests showed sensitivities of 100% but specificities of only 9.1% and 89.1%, respectively. The penicillin MIC test had 100% categorical agreement with blaZ PCR, while penicillin disk diffusion yielded one major error. Only 3/31 patients with penicillin-susceptible isolates were treated with a penicillin family antimicrobial. The majority of cases were treated with other beta-lactams, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or vancomycin. These data indicate that nearly all isolates of S. lugdunensis are susceptible to narrow-spectrum antimicrobial agents. Clinical laboratories in areas with resistance levels similar to those described here can help promote the use of these agents versus vancomycin by effectively designing their antimicrobial susceptibility reports to convey this message.
