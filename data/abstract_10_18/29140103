1. The aim of the present study was to determine if the 9R-strain of the Salmonella Gallinarum live vaccine was responsible for having fowl typhoid outbreaks in chicken flocks from both chicken and turkey breeders as well as to verify the antimicrobial resistance of the isolates from the outbreaks. 2. The triplex polymerase chain reaction, standard antimicrobial test, beta-lactamase genes identification and Ion Torrent PMG whole-genome sequence were used in the field isolates and in the vaccine strain of S. Gallinarum. 3. The 60 tested isolates were not from vaccine origin and manifested high resistance to drugs from macrolide and quinolone groups. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and single nucleotide polymorphism analysis on selected isolates for core genes from Salmonella enterica confirmed the wild origin of these isolates and showed two possible sources of S. Gallinarum in the studied outbreaks. 4. S. Gallinarum isolated from fowl typhoid outbreaks in the studied period were not caused by the use of the SG9R live vaccine. The source of strains sequenced was diverse.
