Health of human beings is subjected to severe threats from the spread of harmful bacteria and the implant-associated infection remains a serious problem in clinic. In this study, a copper-bearing antibacterial titanium alloy, Ti-5Cu, has been developed for dental and orthopedic implant applications. The microstructure, mechanical property, electrochemical corrosion behavior, in vitro antibacterial performance, cytocompatibility and hemocompatibility of the alloy are systematically investigated. The results reveal that the Ti-5Cu alloy which consists of alpha-phase matrix and intermetallic compound Ti2Cu not only possesses strong antibacterial activity against both E. coli and S. aureus, but also exhibits better mechanical properties than the commercial pure titanium. It is confirmed that the release of trace amount of Cu ions from the alloy plays an important role in killing bacteria. In spite of the ion release, Ti-5Cu alloy still reveals excellent corrosion resistance. Moreover, good cytocompatibility and superior hemocompatibility make Ti-5Cu alloy to be a potential solution that could prevent the peri-implant infection in dental and orthopaedic applications.
