INTRODUCTION: In 2009 a deep change in ARV treatment took place in Spain with the introduction of new ARV drugs. The principal objective of the study was to determine the clinical situation of the patients in which DRV/r was introduced in the ARV therapy. METHODS: Observational, cross sectional and multicentre study in which 91 reference hospitals participated. Patient's enrollment was carried out between 2008 and 2009. Data were collected retrospectively considering standard clinical practice. RESULTS: 719 medical records were reviewed. Patients had a different clinical situation compared to nowadays with predominance of multiresistant virus which leaded to virologic failure. The principal reason for introducing DRV/r in the ARV regimen was the virologic failure (54.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Considering this situation, DRV/r became a therapeutic option which represented a change in the ARV paradigm in that period.
