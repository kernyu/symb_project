BACKGROUND: This study describes phenotypic, genotypic and antibiotic susceptibility patterns of the strains isolated from the 2012 Sierra Leone cholera outbreak. Rectal swabs were collected from patients and cultured for Vibrio cholerae O1. METHODS: The isolates were subjected to multiplex PCR, mismatch amplification mutation assay (MAMA) PCR, pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and antibiotic sensitivity tests using disk diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) E-test following standard procedures. RESULTS: Out of 17 rectal swabs tested, 15 yielded V. cholerae O1 biotype El Tor, serotype Ogawa. All the strains belonged to 'altered' variants as MAMA PCR result showed the presence of classical cholera toxin B. PFGE result revealed four pulse types. Using antibiotic disk diffusion, all the isolates were resistant to erythromycin, chloramphenicol, furazolidone, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT) except SL1 which was sensitive to chloramphenicol and SXT. All the isolates were sensitive to nalidixic acid, tetracycline, doxycycline, azithromycin, and ciprofloxacin except SL2 which was resistant to nalidixic acid. However, variable sensitivity patterns were observed for kanamycin. The ranges of MIC were 0.125-0.50 mg/l, 0.003-0.023 mg/l and 0.38-0.75 mg/l for azithromycin, ciprofloxacin and tetracycline, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that altered variants of V. cholerae O1 of four clonal types were responsible for the 2012 outbreak of cholera in Sierra Leone.
