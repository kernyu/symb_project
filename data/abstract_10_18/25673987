Therapeutic options for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection have been limited by drug resistance and adverse side effects. Targeting the host factor cyclophilin A (CypA), which is essential for HCV replication, offers a promising strategy for antiviral therapy. However, due to its immunosuppressive activity and severe side effects, clinical application of cyclosporine A (CsA) has been limited as an antiviral agent. To overcome these drawbacks, we have successfully developed a liver-specific, sustained drug delivery system by conjugating the liver-targeting peptide (LTP) to PEGylated CsA-encapsulated poly (lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) nanoparticles. Furthermore, our delivery system exhibited high specificity to liver, thus contributing to the reduced immunosuppressive effect and toxicity profile of CsA. Finally, targeted nanoparticles were able to effectively inhibit viral replication in vitro and in an HCV mouse model. As a proof of principle, we herein show that our delivery system is able to negate the adverse effects of CsA and produce therapeutic effects in an HCV mouse model.
