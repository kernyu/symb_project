OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mechanisms by which MecA gene expression leads to beta-lactam resistance in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and to study the resistance mechanism of MRSA at the molecular level. METHODS: A variety of molecular biological techniques were employed, including screening MRSA using cefoxitin paper disk method, extraction of MRSA mRNA, reverse transcription into cDNA, real-time fluorescence PCR for quantitation of MecA gene expression, and agar dilution method for assessment of minimum inhibitory concentrations in MRSA treated with cefoxitin, oxacillin, vancomycin, or linezolid. RESULTS: According to the level of resistance of MRSA to cefoxitin, 40 MRSA strains were divided into a low resistance group (n=12), a middle resistance group (n=15), and a high resistance group (n=13). The expression level of the MecA gene in the low resistance group, the middle resistance group, and the high resistance group was 58.87+/-30.30, 363.37+/-200.05, and 1257.72+/-446.63, respectively. MRSA resistance to cefoxitin and oxacillin was 100%; MRSA resistance to vancomycin or linezolid could not be detected. For all 40 MRSA strains the MIC90 for vancomycin was 2.0 mug/mL. CONCLUSION: MecA gene expression levels may correlate with the MRSA level of resistance to cefoxitin within a certain range of concentration.
