OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of drug transporter proteins for TDF is a risk factor for TDF-related renal function decrement. METHODS: This study investigated the association between 3 SNPs (ABCC2-24, 1249, and ABCB1 2677), which are shown to be associated with TDF-induced tubulopathy, and clinically important renal outcomes (>10ml/min/1.73m2 decrement in eGFR relative to baseline, >25% decrement in eGFR, and eGFR <60ml/min/1.73m2) in 703 HIV-1-infected Japanese patients who initiated TDF-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART). Genotyping was performed by allelic discrimination using TaqMan 5'-nuclease assays. RESULTS: 95% of the study patients were males and 66% were treatment-naive, with median CD4 count of 249/mul, median baseline eGFR of 96ml/min/1.73m2 (IQR 84.6-109.2), and median exposure to TDF of 3.66 years (IQR 1.93-5.59). The frequencies of genotypes at -24, 1249 of ABCC2, and 2677 of ABCB1 were neither different between patients with decrement in eGFR of >10ml/min/1.73m2 and those without such decrement (ABCC2: -24, p = 0.53, 1249, p = 0.68; ABCB1: 2677, p = 0.74), nor between those without and with the other two renal outcomes (>25% decrement: ABCC2: -24, p = 0.83, 1249, p = 0.97, ABCB1: 2677, p = 0.40; eGFR <60ml/min/1.73m2: ABCC2: -24, p = 0.51, 1249, p = 0.81, ABCB1: 2677, p = 0.94). Logistic regression analysis showed that the risk genotype of the three SNPs were not associated with any of the three renal outcomes, respectively. Logistic regression model that applied either dominant, recessive, or additive model yielded the same results. CONCLUSIONS: SNPs of the drug transporters for TDF are not associated with clinically important renal outcomes in patients who initiated TDF-containing ART.
