OBJECTIVE: To see the pattern of antimicrobial drug resistance among Salmonella serovars. METHODS: This longitudinal, observational study was conducted at Khan Research Laboratories Hospital, Islamabad, Pakistan, from May 2012 to December 2014. All patients presenting with typhoid fever with positive blood culture were included. Age, gender, salmonella serovar and sensitivity to 9 antimicrobial drugs were taken into account. The tested antimicrobial drugs were ampicillin, trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, ceftriaxone and cefixime. SPSS 22 was used for analysis. RESULTS: Of the 197 patients, 118(59.9%) were males and 79(40.1%) were females. Moreover, there were 78(39.6%) children and 119(60.4%) adults. The overall mean age was 19.58+/-13.82 years. Patients with positive culture for salmonella typhi were 155(78.7%) while patients with positive cultures for salmonella paratyphi A were 42(21.3%). No other serovar was found in this study. Overall percentage of multidrug resistance for both salmonella typhi and paratyphi was 74(37.5%). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of multidrug resistance and quinolone resistance among salmonella serovars was high.
