A series of novel 1-(6-amino-3,5-difluoropyridin-2-yl)fluoroquinolone derivatives containing an oxime functional moiety were synthesized and evaluated for their biological activity. Our results reveal that compounds 9a-9c have considerable activity against both of MTB H37Rv ATCC 27294 (MICs: 3.81-7.13 mug/mL) and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus strains (MICs: <0.008-0.5 mug/mL).
