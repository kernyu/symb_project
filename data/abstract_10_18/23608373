OBJECTIVE: To investigate in vitro and in vivo antibacterial potentials of Vitex negundo (V. negundo) leaf extracts against diverse enteric pathogens. METHODS: Water and methanol extracts of V. negundo leaves were evaluated against enteric bacterial pathogens by using standard disc diffusion, viable bacterial cell count methods, determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC). RESULTS: Methanol extract of V. negundo leaves showed potent antibacterial activity (inhibition zone: 9.9-22.6 mm, MIC: 200-3200 mug/mL, MBC: 200-6400 mug/mL) against all the pathogenic enteric bacteria (Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio mimicus, Echerichia coli, Shigella spps., and Aeromonas spps) tested. Methanol extract of V. negundo leaves showed potent bactericidal activity both in vitro laboratory conditions (MBC, 200-400 mug/mL) and in the intestinal environment (Dose, 1-2 mg/mL) of infant mice against pathogenic Vibrio cholerae, the major causative agent of cholera. Furthermore, assays using the mice cholera model showed that V. negundo methanol extract can protect mice from Vibrio cholerae infection and significantly decrease the mortality rate (P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: For the first time we showed that methanol extract of V. negundo leaves exhibited strong vibriocidal activity both in vitro and in vivo conditions. Therefore, it will be useful to identify and isolate the active compounds of this extract that could be a good alternative of antibiotics to treat cholera.
