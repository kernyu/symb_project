BACKGROUND: Virologic failure following treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 with direct-acting antiviral agents is often accompanied by the emergence of resistant variants. MK-5172 is an investigational once-daily protease inhibitor. We analyzed variants in treatment-naive noncirrhotic patients with virologic failure on MK-5172 (100-800 mg/day) plus pegylated interferon alfa/ribavirin (peg-IFN/RBV) during a phase 2 trial. METHODS: Population and selective clonal sequencing were performed at baseline and at virologic failure in the 4 MK-5172 dosing arms. MK-5172 activity was determined using a mutant replicon assay. RESULTS: Six of 266 (2.3%) MK-5172 recipients satisfied prespecified criteria for virologic failure, all with genotype 1a infection. Five patients with virologic failure were in the MK-5172 100-mg arm, including 4 patients with low plasma MK-5172 levels documented during triple therapy. Variants associated with >4-fold loss of potency were detected in 3 of the 4 patients with genotype 1a breakthrough while on MK-5172. The fifth patient had undetectable HCV-RNA levels at the end of triple therapy but subsequently broke through during the peg-IFN/RBV tail 16 weeks after completion of MK-5172. Three patients had D168 variants at virologic failure, including 2 with the D168A variant associated with a 95-fold loss of potency. The sole apparent relapse was actually a genotype 3a reinfection in the MK-5172 200-mg group. CONCLUSIONS: Virologic failure occurred uncommonly (6/266 [2.3%]) in MK-5172/peg-IFN/RBV recipients. The most prevalent treatment-emergent variants were detected at the D168 locus. D168A variants conferring approximately 2-log reduction in MK-5172 susceptibility emerged in 2 of the 4 evaluable patients with genotype 1a breakthrough. Clinical Trials Registration. NCT01353911.
