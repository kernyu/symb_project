The ever increasing cases of microbial resistance pose a major threat to the scientific community and therefore the need for discovery and development of newer antimicrobial agents with novel mode of action is becoming critical. One of the ways to tackle this herculean problem is to generate hybrid molecules by combining two or more bioactive heterocyclic moieties in a single molecular platform. The review here describes published results of our research group's endeavors towards development of potential new and safe antimicrobial agents with better effectiveness by using the hybrid approach. In the present review article the landscaping of heterocycles like 4-thiazolidinones, benzimidazole and quinoline are described. Compounds displaying two of more fold antimicrobial activity are included in the review.
