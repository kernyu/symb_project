The objective was to evaluate the impact of domestication process on the physiological stress response of cultured Eurasian perch confronted to a chronic stress situation. Briefly, F1 and F4 juveniles were submitted to chronic confinement and investigated on days 5, 15 and 30. Capture and 15min-anesthesia were imposed on fish to assess the effect of preceding confinement on acute stress response. On day 30, the fish were finally challenged with Aeromonas hydrophila and sampled after 5 and 10 days for immune parameter measurements. Cortisol and glucose levels were not affected by confinement but increased significantly after acute stressor exposure. Moreover, cortisol rise following capture and anesthesia was higher in F1 confined-fish, suggesting that they have previously been affected by chronic confinement. A higher HSP70 level was also observed on day 30 in F1 confined-juveniles. During bacterial challenge, regardless of confinement level, F4 juveniles displayed higher lysozyme activity and agglutination response than F1 which may indicate a higher immune capacity in domesticated fish. In conclusion, chronic confinement stressor induced few physiological responses but may increase the responsiveness to other aquacultural stressors. Domestication process also seems to improve chronic stress resistance, growth as well as the immune status of the fish.
