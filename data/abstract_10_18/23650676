The effectiveness of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis in reducing surgical site infections has been demonstrated. Its utility is recognized for clean-contaminated procedures and some clean surgeries. Prophylactic antibiotics are used as intended to cover the most common germs in the surgical site; first and second generation cephalosporins are the most used. For optimal prophylaxis, an antibiotic with a targeted spectrum should be administered at sufficiently high concentrations in serum, tissue, and the surgical wound during the time that the incision is open and risk of bacterial contamination. The infusion of the first dose of antimicrobial should begin within 60 min before surgical incision and should be discontinued within 24 h after the end of surgery The prolonged use of antibiotic prophylaxis leads to emergence of bacterial resistance and high costs. The principles of antimicrobial prophylaxis in cancer surgery are the same as those described for general surgery; it is recommended to follow and comply with the standard criteria. In mastectomies and clean head and neck surgery there are specific recommendations that differ from non-cancer surgery. In the case of very extensive surgeries, such as pelvic surgery or bone surgery with reconstruction, extension of antibiotics for 48-72 h should be considered.
