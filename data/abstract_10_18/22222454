Escalating problems with drug resistance continue to compromise the effectiveness of commercial antibiotics, necessitating the search for novel classes of antimicrobial agents. To circumvent problems with resistance, a multitarget single-pharmacophore approach has been employed to discover inhibitors that possess balanced activity against multiple target enzymes. In this chapter, we examine the application of computational techniques, in particular, structure-based drug design approaches, to design new dual-targeting antibacterial agents against bacterial topoisomerases.
