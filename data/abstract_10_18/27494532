With the continued march of antimicrobial resistance, a renewed impetus for better vaccines has been heralded. Identification of potent subunit vaccines has been greatly facilitated by recent developments in reverse vaccinology and proteomics strategies. There are a range of antimicrobial resistant bacterial pathogens that could be targeted by potent vaccine antigens identified within the coming years. However, cost is a significant hurdle in progressing lead antigen candidates to clinical trials. In order for novel vaccine technologies to realize their clinical potential, there is a requirement to improve investment and incentives to expedite the development of vaccines that are apparently efficacious in preclinical trials.
