Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a notoriously antimicrobial-resistant organism that is increasingly refractory to antimicrobial chemotherapy. While the usual array of acquired resistance mechanisms contribute to resistance development in this organism a multitude of endogenous genes also play a role. These include a variety of multidrug efflux loci that contribute to both intrinsic and acquired antimicrobial resistance. Despite their roles in resistance, however, it is clear that these efflux systems function in more than just antimicrobial efflux. Indeed, recent data indicate that they are recruited in response to environmental stress and, therefore, function as components of the organism's stress responses. In fact, a number of endogenous resistance-promoting genes are linked to environmental stress, functioning as part of known stress responses or recruited in response to a variety of environmental stress stimuli. Stress responses are, thus, important determinants of antimicrobial resistance in P. aeruginosa. As such, they represent possible therapeutic targets in countering antimicrobial resistance in this organism.
