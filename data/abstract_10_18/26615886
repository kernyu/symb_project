A novel conjugate of artesunate-podophyllotoxin was prepared and evaluated for its cytotoxicity against diverse normal and multidrug resistance human cancer cell lines by CCK-8 assay. The conjugate exhibited good cytotoxicity on all the cell lines with IC50 values of 0.453+/-0.156-3.011+/-0.272muM and reduced the resistant factor. The conjugate was further found to disrupt the microtubule network and induce G2/M cell cycle arrest in multidrug resistance K562/ADR cells. Meanwhile, Hoechst staining analysis suggested that conjugate induced cell death by apoptosis. Furthermore, conjugate could downregulate the levels of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in P-gp overexpressing K562/ADR cells.
