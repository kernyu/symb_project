One of the most important features of the post-antibiotic era in the late 20th century is the resurgence of colistin for the treatment of extensively drug resistant gram-negative bacteria (XDR). Colistin is a narrow spectrum anti-biotic, active against microorganisms with clinical significance such as Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Nowadays its toxicity is lower, partly explained by better pharmaceuticals and management of the critically ill patients. However, there has been much confusion regarding the dosage of the drug, its name and labeling, therefore, experts have recommended using a common language about this polymyxin. The lack of PK/PD studies for colistin is perhaps the main weakness of this area of knowledge, even though the before mentioned approach has contributed with new ways to manage and calculate the dose of this antimicrobial. Indeed, the efficiency of colistin in association with a second agent in reducing mortality has not been demonstrated.
