A series of darunavir analogues featuring a substituted bis-THF ring as P2 ligand have been synthesized and evaluated. Very high affinity protease inhibitors (PIs) with an interesting activity on wild-type HIV and a panel of multi-PI resistant HIV-1 mutants containing clinically observed, primary mutations were identified using a cell-based assay. Crystal structure analysis was conducted on a number of PI analogues in complex with HIV-1 protease.
