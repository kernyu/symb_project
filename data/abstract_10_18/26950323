We report the draft genome sequence of a novel livestock-associated t2247-ST692-III methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain designated K12S0375, which was isolated from a chicken carcass in South Korea. The K12S0375 strain contains uncommon genes, including antimicrobial resistance genes (tetL and tetS) and leukotoxin (lukED), and the genomic distance indicates a single lineage in a genome-based phylogenetic tree compared with 459 S. aureus genome sequences. This genome sequence will contribute to understanding epidemiological and genomic features of the ST692 lineage, including antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes.
