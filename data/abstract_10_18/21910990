Nematode parasites infect humans and domestic animals; treatment and prophylaxis require anthelmintic drugs because vaccination and sanitation is limited. Emodepside is a more recently introduced cyclooctadepsipeptide drug that has actions against GI nematodes, lungworm, and microfilaria. It has a novel mode of action which breaks resistance to the classical anthelmintics (benzimidazoles, macrocyclic lactones and cholinergic agonists). Here we review studies on its mode of action which suggest that it acts to inhibit neuronal and muscle activity of nematodes by increasing the opening of calcium-activated potassium (SLO-1) channels.
