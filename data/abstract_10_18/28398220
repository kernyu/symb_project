The emergence of antibiotic resistance has resulted in an increasing difficulty treating clinical infections associated with biofilms formation, one of the key processes contributed to enhance antibiotic resistance in return. With the rapid development of nanotechnology, a new way to overcome antibiotic resistance was opened up. Based on multiple properties especially antibacterial potential of MoS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets that have aroused wide attention, herein, a novel antimicrobial agent to combat resistant gram-positive <i>Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)</i> and gram-negative <i>Salmonella </i>was prepared using chitosan functionalized MoS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets loading tetracycline hydrochloride drugs (abbreviated to CM-TH). The antibacterial and anti-biofilm activities of CM-TH nanocomposites expressed a synergy effect that the combination of nanomaterials and antibiotics were more efficient than both alone did. Particularly, the MIC values were generally decreased by a factor of dozens, suggesting CM-TH may become a possible alternative to traditional antibiotics in disrupting the biofilms and further to overcome antibiotic resistance in treating medical diseases.
