BACKGROUND: Multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens are becoming a major problem worldwide, more so in the immunocompromised hosts resulting in the urgent need of antibiotic stewardship. PURPOSE: To analyze the organisms isolated and the drug resistance pattern in a pediatric oncology unit. RESULTS: Data pertaining to infections with 128 positive cultures in patients with febrile neutropenia over a period of 1-year are presented. The unit antibiotic policy is decided depending on the sensitivity of the prevailing common organisms. We isolated Gram-negative organisms in 56% cases. Escherichia coli and Klebseilla were the most frequent lactose fermenting Gram-negative Bacilli and Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter the nonfermenting Gram-negative Bacilli. Only 20-30% of the Gram-negative organisms cultured were sensitive to a 3rd/4th generation cephalosporin. The combination of a beta-lactam/inhibitor covered 2/3rd of Gram-negative organisms. About 80% of the organisms were sensitive to carbapenems. There was no colistin resistance. About 44% of our cultures grew a Gram-positive bacterial organism and included coagulase negative Staphylococcus. We had an incidence of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus to be 30%. About 30% of the enterococci isolated in our unit were vancomycin-resistant enterococci. About 23% of patients with a positive bacterial culture died. CONCLUSIONS: Infections in pediatric cancer patient's account for about 15-20% of the deaths in developing countries as these patients are at a high risk for developing MDR infections. Resistance rates among Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms have increased worldwide. Every unit needs a rational antibiotic policy. Antibiotic de-escalation and judicious decrease in the duration of antibiotics needs to be practiced.
