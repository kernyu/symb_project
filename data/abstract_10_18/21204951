The oral anaerobic bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis, which is implicated as an important pathogen for chronic periodontitis, requires heme for its growth. Non-iron metalloporphyrins, In-PPIX and Ga-PPIX, were examined for antibacterial effects on P. gingivalis. Both In-PPIX and Ga-PPIX caused retardation of P. gingivalis growth in a dose-dependent fashion. Microarray and qPCR analyses revealed that In-PPIX treatment upregulated the expression of several genes encoding proteins including ClpB and ClpC, which are members of the Clp (caseinolytic protease, Hsp100) family, and aRNR, aRNR-activating protein and thioredoxin reductase, whereas In-PPIX treatment had no effect on the expression of genes encoding proteins involved in heme uptake pathways, Hmu-mediated, Iht-mediated and Tlr-mediated pathways. P. gingivalis ihtA and ihtB mutants were more resistant to In-PPIX than was the wild-type parent, whereas hmuR and tlr mutants did not show such resistance to In-PPIX. The results suggest that In-PPIX is incorporated by the Iht-mediated heme uptake pathway and that it influences protein quality control and nucleotide metabolism and retards growth of P. gingivalis.
