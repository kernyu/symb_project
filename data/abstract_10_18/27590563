OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy of third-line Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy with esomeprazole, amoxicillin, and sitafloxacin for patients with clarithromycin- and metronidazole-based first- and second-line therapy failure. METHODS: Thirty patients with first- and second-line H. pylori eradication failure were treated prospectively with esomeprazole 20mg twice daily, amoxicillin 750mg twice daily, and sitafloxacin 100mg twice daily for 7 days. After 8-12 weeks, the outcome of eradication therapy was assessed by (13)C-urea breath test or stool antigen test. RESULTS: All 30 patients completed the study. Eradication was successful in 25 patients and the eradication rate was 83% in the intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. No specific or significant adverse events were recorded in the 30 patients. Patient characteristics such as sex, body mass index, and pepsinogen I/II ratio did not differ between patients who were treated successfully and those who were not treated successfully. CONCLUSIONS: Third-line H. pylori eradication therapy with esomeprazole, amoxicillin, and sitafloxacin is as safe and effective as previously reported sitafloxacin-based triple therapy.
