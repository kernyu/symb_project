Strategies to monitor and control the spread of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections are dependent on accurate and timely diagnosis of MRSA in both hospital and community settings. In Latin America, significant diversity in diagnostic and susceptibility testing procedures exists at the regional, national and local levels. Various tests for S. aureus and MRSA are available in clinical settings, but the application of these techniques differs between and within countries, and quality control measures are not uniformly applied to verify diagnoses. To optimize the diagnosis of MRSA infections across Latin America, a more consistent approach is required. This may include: adoption and appropriate adaption of specific guidelines for MRSA testing, depending on local resources; establishment of a coordinated system for quality control; regional access to central reference facilities; education of medical and healthcare professionals in best practices; and development of systems to evaluate the implementation of guidelines and best practices.
