A series of chalcone derivatives bearing the 2,4-thiazolidinedione and benzoic acid moieties (8a-s) were synthesized, characterized, and evaluated for their anti-bacterial activity. Among the tested compounds, the most effective were 8a, 8h, 8k, 8n and 8q with MIC value in the range of 0.5-4 mug/mL against six Gram-positive bacteria (including multidrug-resistant clinical isolates). None of the compounds exhibited any activity against the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli 1356 and E. coli 1682 at 64 mug/mL.
