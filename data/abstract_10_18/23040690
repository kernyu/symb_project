We report a case of 43-year-old male with advanced malignant mesothelioma (MM) with a large amount of fluid in the pleural and peritoneal cavity. The addition of endostar to the gemcitabine-cisplatin regimen gave a prompt and significant improvement of clinical symptoms and disappearance of ascites. The patient is still progression free after 27 months. Endostar, in combination with chemotherapy should be explored in the treatment of MM, especially its effect on pleural and ascitic fluid.
