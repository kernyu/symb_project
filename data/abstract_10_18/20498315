A total of 489 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was investigated for metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) production. Molecular analysis detected a blaVIM-1 gene in the chromosome of one isolate and a blaVIM-2 gene carried on the plasmid in seven isolates. Moreover, we showed that an initial screening by combined susceptibility testing of imipenem and ceftazidime followed by a confirmatory EDTA combination disk test represents a valid alternative to the molecular investigation of MBL genes, making MBL detection possible in routine diagnostic laboratories.
