Escherichia albertii is a recently described species that has been associated with gastroenteritis in humans and with healthy and ill birds. Most recently, it has been identified as the causative agent in a food-borne outbreak in Japan. The distribution and clinical importance of E. albertii are not well studied because its importance is unclear. Culture methods for clinical isolation frequently miss E. albertii or incorrectly identify it as Shigella spp., Escherichia coli, or Hafnia alvei. This study was designed to determine if E. albertii could be recovered from chicken carcass rinses collected at slaughter during a 1-year period from November 2009 until October 2010. Colonies were isolated from chicken carcass rinses and tested by PCR for the presence or absence of clpX, lysP, mdh, intimin (eae), Shiga toxins 1 and 2 (stx1, stx2, and stx2f), heat-stable enterotoxin A (staA), and cytolethal distending toxins 1 and 2 (cdtB) genes. Sixty-five isolates were analyzed by sequencing a section of the rpoB gene. Analysis of the rpoB gene sequences revealed 14 fixed differences between E. albertii and other, closely related organisms. The fixed differences found in the rpoB gene could aid in future discrimination of E. albertii from closely related bacteria.
