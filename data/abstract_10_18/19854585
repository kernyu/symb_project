Regional pneumococcal observatories in region Centre, created in 1997, participate with the others pneumococcal observatories alongside the National Reference Center for Pneumococci and the Institut de Veille Sanitaire at the monitoring of the evolution of resistance of pneumococci to antibiotics in France. Between 1997 and 2007, 2427 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae were isolated in part from cerebrospinal fluids, blood and middle ear fluid, from children and adults. The prevalence of pneumococci with a decreased susceptibility to penicillin (PDSP) decreased strongly in region Centre: 56.8 % in 2001, 39.6 % en 2007. These data are similar to the French national data over the same period.
