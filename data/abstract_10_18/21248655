The outcome of patients with urinary tract infections caused by extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL)-producing bacteria (cases) was compared with that of matched controls with urinary tract infections caused by non-extended spectrum beta-lactamases-producing isolates. Significantly, more case patients received inappropriate empiric therapy than controls. Nevertheless, clinical and microbiologic outcomes as well as formation of renal scars did not differ between the 2 groups.
