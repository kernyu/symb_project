This study investigated the effect of heat stress (HS) on mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling involved in translation initiation after resistance exercise in human skeletal muscle. Eight young male subjects performed four sets of six maximal repetitions of knee extension exercises, with or without HS, in a randomized crossover design. HS was applied to the belly of the vastus lateralis by using a microwave therapy unit prior to and during exercise. Muscle biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis before, immediately after, and 1 h after exercise. HS significantly increased the phosphorylation of Akt/PKB, mTOR, and ribosomal protein S6 at 1 h after exercise (P < 0.05), and the 4E-BP1 phosphorylation level, which had initially decreased with exercise, had recovered by 1 h after exercise with HS. In addition, the phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 kinase 1 was significantly increased immediately after exercise with HS (P < 0.05). These results indicate that HS enhances mTOR signaling after resistance exercise in human skeletal muscle.
