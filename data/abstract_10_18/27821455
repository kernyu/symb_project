This study aims to investigate the prevalence and transmission dynamics of the blaNDM-1 gene in animal Escherichia coli strains. Two IncFII blaNDM-1-encoding plasmids with only minor structural variation in the MDR region, pHNEC46-NDM and pHNEC55-NDM, were found to be responsible for the transmission of blaNDM-1 in these strains. The blaNDM-1 gene can be incorporated into plasmids and stably inherited in animal-borne E. coli strains that can be maintained in animal gut microflora even without carbapenem selection pressure.
