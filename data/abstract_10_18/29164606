Immunomodulatory drugs including thalidomide, lenalidomide (LEN) and pomalidomide (POM), are effective for treating multiple myeloma (MM). POM has shown enhanced efficacy with dexamethasone (DEX). Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) with bortezomib is US Food and Drug Administration-approved for treating MM. PLD with LEN or thalidomide has shown efficacy for MM patients. LEN with DEX, PLD and bortezomib achieves high response rates. We evaluated the combination of POM with DEX 40 mg and PLD 5 mg/m(2) with the latter two drugs administered on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 on a 28-day cycle for the treatment of relapsed/refractory MM patients. During Phase 1, the maximum tolerated dose of POM was 4 mg, and was used in Phase 2, which also required patients to be refractory to LEN. However, neutropenia >/= grade 3 was observed in 10/17 (59%) patients, and the dose was lowered to 3 mg. Median PFS was 5.4 months (range, 0.3-29.0 + months). Overall response rates for patients in Phase 2 were 39% and 31% among subjects receiving POM at 3 mg and 4 mg, respectively, and clinical benefit rates were 51% and 44%, respectively. POM, PLD and DEX is a treatment option for relapsed/refractory MM patients including those who are refractory to LEN.
