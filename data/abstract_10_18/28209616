Resistance to xenobiotic nucleosides used to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other cancers remains a major obstacle to clinical management. One process suggested to participate in resistance is reduced uptake into tumor cells via nucleoside transporters, although precise mechanisms are not understood. Through transcriptomic profiling, we determined that low expression of the ergothioneine transporter OCTN1 (SLC22A4; ETT) strongly predicts poor event-free survival and overall survival in multiple cohorts of AML patients receiving treatment with the cytidine nucleoside analogue cytarabine. Cell biological studies confirmed OCTN1-mediated transport of cytarabine and various structurally related cytidine analogues, such as 2'deoxycytidine and gemcitabine, occurs through a saturable process that is highly sensitive to inhibition by the classic nucleoside transporter inhibitors dipyridamole and nitrobenzylmercaptopurine ribonucleoside. Our findings have immediate clinical implications given the potential of the identified transport system to help refine strategies that could improve patient survival across multiple cancer types where nucleoside analogues are used in cancer treatment.
