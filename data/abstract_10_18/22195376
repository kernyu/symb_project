Recent studies suggest that the epidemiology of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is changing and it is no longer only hospital-acquired but may also be community-acquired. Community-acquired Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) strains are emerging threats and are becoming important public health problem because they have been associated with high morbidity and mortality in the community. This review aims at highlighting the characteristics of these emergent strains of Staphylococcus aureus with a view to better management and control. The review, which consists of literature search of journals and chapters in books, provides an insight to the emergence of strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the community. It focuses on the changing epidemiology, molecular basis of resistance, pathogenesis, laboratory investigations and treatment of infections caused by these new strains. It is interesting to note that as a result of the emergence of these strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the community, the treatment options for MRSA is changing. This is due to the fact that these community strains have unique combinations of resistance traits and virulence factors which have enhanced their ability for colonization and pathogenesis. Their emergence in the community heralds a need for new approaches to the management of both suspected and confirmed staphylococcal infections. Since CA-MRSA constitutes a public health problem, there should be increased vigilance in the diagnosis and management of suspected and confirmed staphylococcal infections.
