Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is one of the common pathogens of opportunistic infections in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases. When the patients are treated with immunosuppressants that make them more susceptible to CMV, the course of ulcerative colitis (UC) becomes considerably worse. Antiviral therapy sometimes can reduce the risk of complications and the rate of colectomies. At the same time, antiviral therapy is not mandatory for all UC patients with CMV infection, as shown by the results of numerous investigations. One of the properties of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) is to suppress the body's immune reactions to allostimulation, rather than to infection invasion. In vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that MSCs have antiviral and antimicrobial activities. The described clinical case shows that clinical improvement occurred and a drastic activation of proliferative processes in the colonic mucosa was detected in the patient with UC after MSC transplantation. Administration of cultured MSCs also promoted the elimination of CMV without antiviral therapy and the overcoming of hormone dependence/ resistance in the patient with UC.
