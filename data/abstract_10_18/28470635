According to public awareness, high rates of multiresistant organisms in healthcare facilities are mainly associated with two terms: "Hospital" and "Infection control problem". The use of antibiotics in ambulatory and hospital care is probable at least as important or even more important. Antibiotics lead to selection of multiresistant organisms. Microbiome research will lead to a better understanding of this relationship and may provide new measures for preventing the spread of multiresistant organisms. The available data underline the need of a close interaction between antibiotic stewardship and infection control.
