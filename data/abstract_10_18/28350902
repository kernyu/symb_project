Antibacterial resistance is increasing globally and has been recognized as a major public health threat. Antibacterial stewardship is the coordinated effort to improve the appropriate use of antibiotics with the aim to decrease selective pressure for multidrug-resistant organisms in order to preserve the utility of antibacterial agents. This article describes the activities of the Antibacterial Resistance Leadership Group (ARLG) in the area of antibacterial stewardship. To date, the ARLG has focused intensely on development of rapid diagnostic tests, which (when coupled with educational and institutional initiatives) will enable the robust stewardship that is needed to address the current crisis of antibacterial resistance. In addition to exploring the effectiveness of stewardship techniques in community hospitals, the ARLG has also developed strategy trials to assess the feasibility of reducing antibacterial usage while preserving patient outcome.
