BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the effect of antibiotic stewardship programs (ASP) on reducing antimicrobial resistance rate, antibiotics consumption and multi-drug resistance bacterial infections in the pediatric patients. METHODS: This study was carried out in the Pediatric Center of a tertiary hospital of Shandong Province, China. The study duration was separated into two periods according to introduction of ASP (began from April 2011). Before intervention: from April 2009 to March 2011; after intervention: from April 2012 to March 2014. The consumption of antibiotics, defined daily dose (DDD), isolation of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) and resistance rate of antibiotics were analyzed and compared between the two study periods. RESULTS: Total antibiotics consumption (DDDs) reduced from 56,725 in 2011 to 31,380 in 2014; antibiotic use density (AUD) reduced from 93.8 to 43.5; mean (+/- SD) antibiotic costs per patient (per quarter) decreased from 637 (+/- 29) RMB to 462 (+/- 49) RMB; and the mean total drug consumption (g)/DDD (DDDs) for inpatients decreased from 90.4 (+/- 3.3) to 56.4 (+/- 9.5). Multidrug-resistant microorganisms isolation reduced significantly from 463 (20.0) to 216 (6.9%). Resistance rate of general spectrum antibiotics reduced remarkably after intervention. The proportion of patients colonized or infected with Carbapenems-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii was correlated with DDDs of carbapenem. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of ASP leads to reduced medical expense, decrease of improper and abuse of antibiotics, and reduced antibiotics resistance rate and MDRO isolation. Continuous efforts to improve antibiotic use are required.
