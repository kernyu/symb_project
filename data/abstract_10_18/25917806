Sore throat remains a common disease of childhood, and a major cost and cause for antibiotic prescriptions. The management of sore throat remains controversial in affluent countries with various guidelines available and overall poor adherence to those guidelines. Group A streptococcus is the commonest bacterial cause with important sequelae including acute rheumatic fever (ARF). The driver for diagnosis and treatment is still questionable. In most affluent populations it is difficult to justify antibiotic treatment on the basis of preventing ARF, whereas this remains the major driver for sore throat management in populations at higher risk of ARF. Reduction in severity and duration of symptoms may be a reasonable basis to consider antibiotic treatment, and thus accurate diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis, particularly in those with more severe symptoms. The potential role of rapid tests in diagnosis appears to be increasing.
