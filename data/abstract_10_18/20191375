To report two cases with missed intraocular foreign body masquerading as intraocular inflammation. The first patient was referred to our clinic with a diagnosis of a traumatic cataract. She had a history of ocular trauma. The clinical examination revealed intraocular inflammation and a mature cataract. Plain X-ray did not reveal a foreign body. She underwent a successful cataract surgery and intraocular lens implantation 1 month after the initial examination. Two months after the surgery she returned with visual impairment and intraocular inflammation. The foreign body was discovered on the surface of the iris during the follow-up. The second patient was referred to us for endophthalmitis. He denied ocular trauma. Plain X-ray, computerized tomography, and ultrasonography did not show a foreign body, but because of clinical suspicion, surgery was scheduled. In both patients the intraocular foreign bodies in the anterior chamber were removed successfully by a limbal approach. The patients remained symptom free after the foreign bodies were removed. The intraocular inflammation did not persist. A history of ocular trauma, unexplained intraocular inflammation, or intraocular inflammation unresponsive to the standard therapies should alert the physician to the presence of an intraocular foreign body. Further investigations should be performed in these cases to detect the foreign body.
