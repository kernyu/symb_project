Therapy of chronic hepatitis B has improved by the invention of the potent nucleos(t)ide analogues entecavir, telbivudine and tenofovir disoproxil. Due to increasing prevalence of lamivudine resistance the appropriate first line therapy may prevent emergence of any new resistance and avoid combination therapy. The present case describes a complex history of chronic hepatitis B in the setting of renal failure after two renal transplants illustrating why lamivudine should not be used as first line treatment option any more. Instead, entecavir offers high antiviral potency, low risk for resistance and possible individual dose titration by an oral solution.
