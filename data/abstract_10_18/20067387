Daptomycin has been approved and successfully launched for the treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by gram-positive pathogens [1] and bacteremia and right-sided endocarditis due to Staphylococcus aureus, including strains that are resistant to methicillin or other antibiotics [2]. The development of the drug, however, was not straightforward; it involved a cast of characters, including scientists at Eli Lilly and at Cubist Pharmaceuticals. Of most importance, the development of daptomycin involved the tenacious leadership of Dr. Francis Tally. As a tribute to Dr. Tally, we attempt to reconstruct the path of daptomycin from the mountain to the clinic.
