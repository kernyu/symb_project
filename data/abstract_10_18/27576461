Antibiotics have proven to be enormously effective tools in combating infectious diseases. A common roadblock to the effective use of antibiotics is the development of antibiotic resistance.

In this review, we offer some thoughts on the ways in which antibiotics have been observed to influence immune responses to bacteria.
