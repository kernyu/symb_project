Recombinant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) containing a CRF01_AE Gag, AE-Gag62, was significantly less susceptible to protease inhibitors (PIs) than the subtype B reference strain, NL4-3; therefore, the mechanism of how AE-Gag62 reduced viral drug susceptibility to PIs was studied in this report. The results showed that the lysine residue at amino acid position 165 (K165) of AE-Gag62 played a role in reducing the drug susceptibility of the recombinant virus to PIs. In addition, K165 potentially appears more frequently in CRF01_AE viruses than in the viruses of other major HIV-1 subtypes. Although K165 had no effect on the extent of recombinant protease-mediated in vitro Gag cleavage, it enhanced the incorporation of the Gag-Pol precursor protein, p160, into virions. Taken together, these results suggest that K165 of CRF01_AE Gag affects the regulation of virion assembly or maturation, and reduces viral drug susceptibility to PIs.
