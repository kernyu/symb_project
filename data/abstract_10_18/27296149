BACKGROUND: Obesity has been recognized as a state of subclinical inflammation resulting in a loss of insulin receptors and decreased insulin sensitivity. We here studied in vivo the role of circulating matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8) among young healthy twin adults. Also, in vitro analysis of the cleavage of human insulin receptor (INSR) by MMP-8 was investigated as well its inhibition by doxycycline and other MMP-8 inhibitor, Ilomastat/GM6001, which are broad-spectrum MMP inhibitors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analysed serum MMP-8 levels by a time-resolved immunofluorometric assay in obese (n = 34), overweight (n = 76) and normal weight (n = 130) twin individuals. The effect of MMP-8 on INSR and the effects of synthetic MMP-8 inhibitors, doxycycline and Ilomastat/GM6001, were studied by SDS-PAGE. RESULTS: We found that in obese individuals relative to normal weight individuals, the serum MMP-8 levels and MMP-8/TIMP-1 ratio were significantly increased (P = 0.0031 and P = 0.031, respectively). Among normal weight and obese individuals, also smoking significantly increases serum MMP-8 and MMP-8/TIMP-1 ratio. In vitro, we found that INSR was degraded by MMP-8 and this was inhibited by doxycycline and Ilomastat/GM6001. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity associated with elevated circulating MMP-8 found among young adults may contribute to progression of insulin resistance by cleaving INSR. This INSR cleavage by MMP-8 can be inhibited by synthetic MMP-8 inhibitors such as doxycycline. In addition to obesity, also smoking independently explained increased MMP-8 levels. Our results suggest that MMP-8 is an essential mediator in systemic subclinical inflammatory response in obesity, and a potential drug target.
