Although antibacterial therapy has an impact on human intestinal flora and the emergence of resistant bacteria, its role in the amplification of antimicrobial resistance and the quantitative exposure-effect relationship is not clear. An observational prospective study was conducted to determine whether and how ceftriaxone exposure is related to amplification of resistance in non-intensive care unit (non-ICU) patients. Serial stool samples from 122 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-positive (ESBL(+)) hospitalized patients were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR to quantify the resistant gene blaCTX-M Drug exposure was calculated for each patient by using a population pharmacokinetic model. Multi- and univariate regression and classification regression tree (CART) analyses were used to explore relationships between measures of exposure and amplification of blaCTX-M genes. Amplification of blaCTX-M was observed in 0% (0/11) of patients with no treatment and 33% (20/61) of patients treated with ceftriaxone. Stepwise regression analysis showed a significant association between amplification of blaCTX-M and the plasma area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h for the unbound fraction of the drug (fAUC0-24), the maximum concentration of drug in serum for the unbound fraction of the drug (fCmax), and the duration of ceftriaxone therapy. Using CART analysis, amplification of blaCTX-M was observed in 11/16 (69%) patients treated for >14 days and in 9/40 (23%) patients treated for </=14 days (P = 0.0019). In the latter group, amplification was observed in 5/7 (71%) patients with an fAUC0-24 of >/=222 mg . h/liter and in 4/33 (12%) patients with lower drug exposures (P = 0.0033). A similar association was found for an fCmax of >/=30 mg/liter (63% versus 13%, P = 0.0079). A significant association was found between the amplification of blaCTX-M resistance genes and exposure to ceftriaxone. Both duration of treatment and degree of ceftriaxone exposure have a significant impact on the amplification of resistance genes.
