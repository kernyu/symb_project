Tigecycline (TGC)-resistant extensively drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (XDRAB) is an increasing threat in regard to nosocomial infections. The resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) efflux pump has played an important role in TGC resistance. In this study, total 81 TGC-resistant XDRAB isolates were analyzed for their responses to the efflux pump inhibitor 1-(1-naphthylmethyl)-piperazine (NMP). We found that NMP could reduce by 4-fold or greater than 4-fold the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of TGC in 45 isolates (55.6 %). After typing with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), group A appeared to be the major cluster with good synergistic response to NMP. Transcripts of the AdeABC efflux pump gene were consistently more correlated with TGC resistance than transcripts of the AdeFGJ or AdeIJK efflux pump genes in these isolates. Of the 81 isolates, the amino acid sequences of AdeR and AdeS were further classified and combined into 31 different codes. Although the dissemination of TGC-resistant XDRAB isolates was genetically diverse in our hospital, their responses to NMP conversion were still strain-dependent. We found that AdeRS combination codes were better than PFGE typing in separating groups of isolates with different sensitivity to NMP conversion.
