The use of antibiotics in the European Union was banned since the 1(st) of January 2006. At present, and even though such ban, residues of drugs used in animal therapy or, illegally, as growth promoters might be found in food. Such residues may cause adverse health effects on consumers like allergic reactions in sensitive individuals develop transmissible antimicrobial resistance in food microflora, and have technological implications in the manufacture of fermented products. This is the reason why to check food for the presence of antibiotics residues is still necessary. ELISA test constitutes an attractive screening technique due to its simplicity, large number of samples per kit and possibility of automation. The aim of this manuscript is to provide a review of the numerous patents and applications for the analysis of antibiotic residues in foods.
