To obtain information about Salmonella from commercial birds and poultry environments within Mississippi, 50 Salmonella enterica isolates were collected and characterized by intergenic sequence ribotyping (ISR) serotyping and by determining antimicrobial resistance. ISR assigned serotype to all 50 Salmonella enterica isolates whereas the Kauffman-White-LeMinor antibody-based scheme assigned serotype to 48. Agreement between both methods was K = 89.58. Within the set, 12 serotypes were detected. The antimicrobial resistance patterns (ARP) of 12 serotypes, namely Enteritidis, Typhimurium, Kentucky, Bredeney, Mbandaka, Saintpaul, Montevideo, Cubana, Lille, Senftenberg, Johannesburg, and one serotype UN0094, were determined using minimum inhibitory concentration values. The antibiograms demonstrated differences between Salmonella serotypes and among isolates of the same serotype. All isolates were 100% susceptible to enrofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The number of antimicrobials to which the isolates were resistant ranged from two to nine. Twenty-two different ARPs were identified and ARP1, with resistance to spectinomycin and sulfadimethoxine, was most frequently observed. Forty isolates (80%) were resistant to three or more antimicrobials and were thus designated multidrug resistant. Detection of a unique serotype, and variation in antibiograms within the set, demonstrates that it is important to survey isolates periodically from a region to follow epidemiologic trends.
