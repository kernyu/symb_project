Emergence of resistance to two most potent first line anti-TB drugs i.e. isoniazid and rifampicin (multidrug resistant TB MDR TB) is well known, but, the second line drugs used to treat MDR-TB are also showing resistance to the same strain of Mycobacteria (extensively drug resistance TB, XDR-TB). We report 3 children with partial XDR TB. Two responded to treatment while one was lost to follow-up.
