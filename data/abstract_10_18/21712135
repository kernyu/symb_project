OBJECTIVE: Recently, CTX-M-15-producing Enterobacteriaceae has disseminated worldwide. To better understand the success of CTX-M-15-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, we compared the CTX-M-15-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates with CTX-M-14-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates that had been more prevalent before the recent increase of CTX-M-15 in Korea. METHODS: Eighty-nine CTX-M-producing E. coli bloodstream infection isolates and 33 K. pneumoniae bloodstream infection isolates were collected in 2008 from nine hospitals in Korea. In vitro susceptibility testing and multilocus sequence typing were performed for all isolates. Phylogenetic groupings and distribution of virulence determinants and addiction systems were examined for only E. coli isolates. RESULTS: Among the 89 CTX-M-producing E. coli isolates, 54 isolates (60.7%) contained bla(CTx-M-15) and bla(CTx-M-14) was identified in 31 isolates (34.8%). Among 33 CTX-M-producing K. pneumoniae isolates, bla(CTx-M-14) and bla(CTx-M-15) were identified in 18 (54.5%) and 15 (45.5%) isolates, respectively. While CTX-M-14- and CTX-M-15-producing E. coli isolates displayed similar antimicrobial resistance rates, CTX-M-15-producing K. pneumoniae isolates showed significantly higher resistance rates of ciprofloxacin and piperacillin-tazobactam than CTX-M-14-producing isolates. ST131 and ST405 were the main clones in both CTX-M-14- and CTX-M-15-producing E. coli isolates. Although the frequency of virulence determinants was similar between two E. coli groups, ST131 and ST405 isolates producing CTX-M-15 showed higher frequency of determinants. In addition, CTX-M-15-producing E. coli isolates showed higher prevalence of addiction systems, particularly vagCD. ST405 showed the highest prevalence rates among main E. coli clones. In K. pneumoniae, ST15 and ST11, with high resistance rates, were the main clones of CTX-M-15-producing isolates, but no main clones was found among CTX-M-14-producing isolates because of extreme diversity. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid increase of CTX-M-15-producing E. coli isolates was due to certain clone with high frequency of virulence determinants and addiction systems. High antimicrobial resistance rates of CTX-M-15-producing K. pneumoniae isolates may contribute to their increase.
