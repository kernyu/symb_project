BACKGROUND: This study assessed the pharmacodynamics of ceftaroline against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), heteroresistant (h) vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (hVISA), VISA and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) using an in vitro model. METHODS: Two methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), one community-associated (CA)-MRSA, one healthcare-associated (HA)-MRSA, one hVISA, three VISA and two VRSA were studied. The pharmacodynamic model was inoculated with a concentration of 1 x 10(6) cfu/mL and ceftaroline dosed every 12 h (at 0 and 12 h) to simulate the fC(max) and t((1/2)) obtained after administering 600 mg intravenously every 12 h (fC(max), 16 mg/L; t((1/2)), 2.6 h). Samples were collected over 24 h to assess viable growth and changes in ceftaroline MIC over time. RESULTS: Ceftaroline fT(> MIC) of >/= 92% (ceftaroline MICs, </= 1 mg/L) was bactericidal (>/= 3 log(1)(0) killing) against MSSA, CA-MRSA, HA-MRSA, hVISA, VISA and VRSA at 12 and 24 h. No bacterial regrowth occurred over the study period and no change in ceftaroline MIC was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Ceftaroline fT(> MIC) of >/= 92% (ceftaroline MICs, </= 1 mg/L) was bactericidal (>/= 3 log(1)(0) killing) against MSSA, CA-MRSA, HA-MRSA, hVISA, VISA and VRSA at 12 and 24 h.
