There were investigated 23,292 clinical cultures of S. aureus, revealed in 2009 year in patients, admitted to the surgical departments of 97 multispeciality stationaries of different regions in Ukraine. There was determined the sensitivity of S. aureus stams to 42 antimicrobal preparations (AMP) in accordance to recommendations of National Committee for Clinical Laboratory standards of U.S.A. (NCCLS). Cefazolium, imipenem, azytromycin tycoplanin and vancomycin were the most active antibiotics. The rate of disclosure of methylrestant cultures (MRSA) had constituted in different stationaries from 10.8 to 84.1, 53.8% at average. The conduction of a constant monitoring of resistance to antibiotics we consider necessary in every stationary with subsequent elaboration of the hospital antibiotics formular because of a constant changes taking place and essential difference of nosocomial S. Aureus cultures present across the state regions. The tactics of AMP application must be elaborated for every surgical stationary depending on the data obtained about resistance of infectious causing agents to antibiotics. It is necessary to implement the epidemiological supervising system of the microorganisms resistance on local, regional and national levels.
