Co-delivery system has been proposed in pharmaceutical field aim to synergistic treatments. The combination formulation is also important in traditional pesticides formulations based on the low pest resistance risk and wide fungicidal spectrum. However, co-delivery nanoparticles (NPs) tend to be more environmentally friendly for the sustained-release behaviour and none of toxic organic solvents or dusts. Hence, we constructed co-delivery NPs which could delivery two kinds of pesticides, which function was similar with pesticides combination formulation. The co-delivery NPs of validamycin and hexaconazole were prepared with the amphiphilic copolymer methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)- poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (mPEG-PLGA) used an improved double emulsion method. The chemical structure of mPEG-PLGA copolymer was confirmed using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). The co-delivery NPs all exhibited good size distribution and held sustained-release property. Germicidal efficacy of the co-delivery NPs against Rhizoctonia cerealis was also studied. The germicidal efficacy of co-delivery NPs against Rhizoctonia cerealis was better than that of traditional pesticides formulation. In addition, co-delivery NPs showed a lasting impact against Rhizoctonia cerealis.
