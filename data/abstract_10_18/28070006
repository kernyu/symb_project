AbstractLeishmania (Viannia) braziliensis is the main causative species of tegumentary leishmaniasis in Brazil. In this study, we evaluated the susceptibility of 16 clinical isolates of L. (V.) braziliensis from different regions of Brazil to miltefosine in vitro. Half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of miltefosine varied from 22.9 to 144.2 muM against promastigotes and from 0.3 to 4.2 muM against intracellular amastigotes. No significant differences were found between isolates of different geographical origins. A clear correlation between the EC50 against promastigotes and amastigotes within each isolate was found. These findings contribute to the evaluation of miltefosine's potential and limitations for the treatment of tegumentary leishmaniasis in Brazil.
