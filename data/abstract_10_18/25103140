The aims of this study were to evaluate the epidemiology of nosocomial candidemia in a tertiary hospital in South Brazil and the in vitro antifungal susceptibility of isolates. Blood strains from 108 patients were identified by PCR-based method. Some 30.5 % of candidemia were caused by Candida tropicalis, 28.7 % were due to Candida albicans, 24.1 % with Candida parapsilosis sensu stricto, 8.3 % with Candida glabrata sensu lato, 1.8 % involved Candida krusei and 6.6 % with other species. Candidemia was more common in intensive care unit settings (66 %). In vitro susceptibility to antifungal drugs was determined by a microdilution method; and new species-specific clinical breakpoints for fluconazole and voriconazole were applied. Overall susceptibility rates were 100 % for itraconazole, 91 % for fluconazole, 98 % for voriconazole and 99 % for amphotericin B. Fluconazole resistance was mostly among C. parapsilosis sensu stricto isolates (26.9 %). Most of the findings reported here agreed with epidemiological features common to other tertiary hospitals in Brazil; but also revealed some peculiarities, such as a high frequency of C. tropicalis associated with candidemia. Besides, high rate of fluconazole resistance among C. parapsilosis stricto sensu isolates was obtained when applying the new species-specific clinical breakpoints.
