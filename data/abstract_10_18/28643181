Nisin fermentation by Lactococcus lactis requires a low pH to maintain a relatively higher nisin activity. However, the acidic environment will result in cell arrest, and eventually decrease the relative nisin production. Hence, constructing an acid-resistant L. lactis is crucial for nisin harvest in acidic nisin fermentation. In this paper, the first discovery of the relationship between D-Asp amidation-associated gene (asnH) and acid resistance was reported. Overexpression of asnH in L. lactis F44 (F44A) resulted in a sevenfold increase in survival capacity during acid shift (pH 3) and enhanced nisin desorption capacity compared to F44 (wild type), which subsequently contributed to higher nisin production, reaching 5346 IU/mL, 57.0% more than that of F44 in the fed-batch fermentation. Furthermore, the engineered F44A showed a moderate increase in D-Asp amidation level (from 82 to 92%) compared to F44. The concomitant decrease of the negative charge inside the cell wall was detected by a newly developed method based on the nisin adsorption amount onto cell surface. Meanwhile, peptidoglycan cross-linkage increased from 36.8% (F44) to 41.9% (F44A), and intracellular pH can be better maintained by blocking extracellular H(+) due to the maintenance of peptidoglycan integrity, which probably resulted from the action of inhibiting hydrolases activity. The inference was further supported by the acmC-overexpression strain F44C, which was characterized by uncontrolled peptidoglycan hydrolase activity. Our results provided a novel strategy for enhancing nisin yield through cell wall remodeling, which contributed to both continuous nisin synthesis and less nisin adsorption in acidic fermentation (dual enhancement).
