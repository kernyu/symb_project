Antimicrobial resistance is a global threat caused by the rapid spread of multiresistant microorganisms. Antimicrobial stewardship (AS) is a coordinated intervention designed to improve the appropriate use of antimicrobials by promoting the selection of the optimal drug regimen, dose, duration of therapy and route of administration. AS programs have proved effective in reducing antimicrobial resistance, inappropriate antimicrobial use and in improving patient outcomes. Recently developed rapid diagnostic technologies in microbiology (RDTM) allows a faster and etiological diagnosis of infection and a reduction in the use of unnecessary empirical therapies. This may result in important advancement in time-critical care pathways for septic patients. Nevertheless, RDTM are costly and if not rationally positioned may consume resources and hinder the efficacy of AS programs. In this regard, Tuscany Region is engaged in designing, through a systemic approach, an effective high-quality clinical microbiological service grid. In order to develop a sustainable and equitable model for integrating diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship we conducted a survey in the regional network of 14 microbiological laboratories. The results shows that in order to develop a sustainable service we need to improve the communication at the interface between laboratories and care unit, harmonize the time windows for processing samples and to devise a robust score for stratifying patient with suspected sepsis.
