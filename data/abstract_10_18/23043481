Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) hold promise to circumvent the emergence of drug resistance occurring in the treatment of bacteria using many conventional antibiotics. Antimicrobial peptidomimetics, which mimic bactericidal mechanisms of AMPs, may overcome the disadvantages of AMPs and become the new generation of antibiotic therapeutics. In this review, some recent examples in the development of antimicrobial peptidomimetics are highlighted. The potential of antimicrobial agents has been demonstrated for therapeutic uses. Meanwhile, perspectives on their further development and applications are also presented.
