AIM: Comparative study of antibiotics resistance and VNTR-typing of Vibrio cholerae non O1/ non O139 strains, isolated on the territory of Rostov region in 2014. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antibioticogramms of strains were determined by serial dilution method in dense nutrient medium according to MG 4.2.2495-09 (2009). Pheno-, sero- and VNTR-typing was carried out by conventional-methods. RESULTS: The studied strains belonged to V. cholerae species, did not agglutinate with O1 and O139 sera, were atoxigenic hemolysis-positive, did not contain genes of cholera toxin and toxin-coregulating pili of adhesion, contained genes of hemagglutinin/protease, protease PrtV, collagenase, cytotonic factor Cef, outer membrane protein-OmpW, tol- and -vps-clusters, regulatory genes toxR and hapR. Antibioticogramms of the strains have shown the presence of cultures, resistant to ampicillin, ceftazidime-furazolidone, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole with intermediate resistance to streptomycin, kanamycin, gentamycin, amikacin, netilmicin, Approximately 20% of isolates had multiple drug resistance. Data of VNTR- and genotyping confirmed a possibility of water transmission route of the infection. CONCLUSION: Execution of monitoring of cultures from environmental samples is necessary for timely detection of genetic characteristics, antibiotics resistance.
