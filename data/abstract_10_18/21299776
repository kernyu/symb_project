BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections (UTIs), the most common form of bacterial infection in kidney transplant recipients, recently have been demonstrated to be detrimental for long-term graft outcome. Therefore, reinforcing antibiotic prophylaxis might be vital, in addition to basic hygiene recommendations, surgical care, and prophylaxis by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. METHODS: In 2006, a Legionella pneumophila contamination of our department's water pipes meant that all the patients undergoing renal transplantation underwent a 1-month regimen of ofloxacin (OFLO) (200 mg every other day). We took this opportunity to measure the incidence of UTI, including acute pyelonephritis (APN), in 100 consecutive patients transplanted before (n = 50) and after (n = 50) this treatment decision was reached. We also studied the antimicrobial resistance profiles in our department and in the rest of the hospital. RESULTS: No patient developed Legionnaire's disease. A dramatic decrease in the incidence of UTI (-63%) was also seen in patients undergoing OFLO treatment. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the use of OFLO was independently associated with a reduction in UTI (odd ratio [OR] = 0.31%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.11-0.84, P = 0.02) and APN (OR = 0.21%, 95% CI 0.07-0.98, P = 0.045). This protection was sustained during the whole first year post transplantation. As for resistance rates, we observed a decrease in the susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin in our nephrology department, compared with that observed in the rest of the hospital. The incidence of multi-resistant bacteria was stable. DISCUSSION: Our unintentional extension of prophylactic antibiotherapy with OFLO gave rise to a dramatic decrease in the 1-year incidence of UTI and APN in kidney recipients. Emergence of resistant strains is, however, a major concern.
