Levofloxacin susceptibility testing was carried out for a total of 2539 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates obtained from January 2001 to February 2008 at the National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) and a further 228 pneumococcal isolates obtained from January 2004 to December 2006 at three other hospitals in different geographical areas in Taiwan. Levofloxacin non-susceptible S. pneumoniae isolates were subsequently analysed for serotype and molecular epidemiology. Rates of levofloxacin non-susceptibility of S. pneumoniae increased significantly from 1.2% in 2001 to 4.2% in 2007 at NTUH. A total of 30 isolates of levofloxacin non-susceptible S. pneumoniae isolates (MIC >/= 4 mg/L) were available for evaluation of serotype, antimicrobial susceptibility, nucleotide sequence of the quinolone resistance-determining regions of parC, gyrA, parE and gyrB, reserpine effect on quinolone susceptibility and multilocus sequence type. Among these isolates, seven (23.3%) were from children, and two (6.7%; one from a 3- and one from a 93-year-old patient) were from blood. One levofloxacin-resistant isolate (MIC = 8 mg/L) was recovered from a previously healthy child with bacteraemic necrotizing pneumonia complicated by empyema and a haemolytic-uraemic syndrome. All isolates except two had Ser79 and/or Asp83 changes in ParC, and/or Ser81 or Glu85 changes in GyrA. An efflux phenotype concerning levofloxacin was detected in only one (3.3%) isolate. A novel clone (ST3642), genetically related to Spain(9V)-3 and belonging to serotype 11A, was identified. Dissemination of clonal complexes related to Spain(23F)-1, Taiwan(19F)-14, Spain(9V)-3 and Taiwan(23F)-15 has contributed to levofloxacin non-susceptibility among these S. pneumoniae isolates from Taiwan.
