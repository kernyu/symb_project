Rapid methods for diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) drug resistance and choosing appropriate antibiotic treatment are pivotal. Thirty isoniazid (INH)-resistant and 30 INH-susceptible Mtb isolates were evaluated using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method followed by multiplex real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) for detection of mutation in 315 codon of katG gene and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) for detection of mutation in -15 (C>T) in the regulatory zone of mabA-inhA were carried out using the TaqMan method. Primers and probe were used for IS6110 region of Mtb as an internal amplification control. The sensitivity and specificity of the RT-PCR TaqMan probe for detection of Mtb complex were 100 %. Detection of INH-resistant Mtb using the ARMS method for KatG had 69 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity. The sensitivity and specificity of SNP in mabA-inhA fragment for detection of INH-resistant Mtb were 53 and 100 %, respectively. Furthermore, considering both regions, the sensitivity of RT-PCR has increased to 75 %. This study revealed that the qPCR-TaqMan method can be used as a standard tool for diagnosis of Mtb. Moreover, ARMS and SNP RT-PCR TaqMan methods can be used as rapid screening methods for detection of INH-resistant Mtb.
