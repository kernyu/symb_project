We describe the first cefixime-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae strain in Austria that caused treatment failure.It follows the first five cases in Europe of cefixime treatment failure, reported in Norway in 2010 and the United Kingdom in 2011. Effective treatment of gonorrhoea is crucial for public health control and, at present, requires substantially enhanced awareness, more frequent test-of-cure, interaction with experts after therapeutic failure, tracing and therapy of contacts, and surveillance of gonococcal antimicrobial resistance and treatment failures worldwide.
