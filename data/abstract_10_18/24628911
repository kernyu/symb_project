FK520, a homolog of antifungal FK506, displays fungicidal synergism with azoles in Candida albicans and inhibits drug efflux mediated by ABC multidrug transporter. This study establishes the molecular basis of interaction of FK520 with Cdr1 protein, which is one of the major ABC multidrug transporters of C. albicans. For this, we have exploited an in-house library of Cdr1 protein consisting of 252 mutant variants where the entire primary structure of the two transmembrane domains comprising of 12 transmembrane helices was subjected to alanine scanning. With these mutant variants of Cdr1 protein, we could identify the critical amino acids of the transporter protein, which if replaced with alanine, not only abrogated FK520-dependent competitive inhibition of drug efflux but simultaneously decreased susceptibility to azoles. Notably, the replacement of most of the residues with alanine was inconsequential; however, there were close to 13% mutant variants, which showed abrogation of drug efflux and reversal of fungicidal synergy with azoles. Of note, all the intrahelical residues of Cdr1 protein, which abrogated inhibitor's ability to block the efflux and reversed fungicidal synergy, were common. Taken together, our results provide evidence of cross-talk of FK520 with Cdr1 by interacting with the select intrahelical residues of the protein to chemosensitize isolates of Candida.
