We characterized 30 community-associated extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli isolates collected from five hospitals in the United States. Nineteen sequence types were identified. All sequence type 131 (ST131) isolates had the fimH30 allele. IncFII-FIA-FIB was the most common replicon type among the blaCTX-M-carrying plasmids, followed by IncFII-FIA and IncA/C. Restriction analysis of the IncFII-FIA-FIB and IncFII-FIA plasmids yielded related profiles for plasmids originating from different hospitals. The plasmids containing blaCTX-M or blaSHV were stably maintained after serial passages.
