BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to clarify retrospectively the characteristics of children hospitalized for respiratory tract infection caused by macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae). METHODS: Children who were hospitalized for respiratory tract infection due to M. pneumoniae were enrolled in this study. The diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection was made on the grounds of polymerase chain reaction results. RESULTS: Thirty-three children were hospitalized due to lower respiratory tract infection with M. pneumoniae. Of the 33 children, 31 (median age five years) were identified as being infected with macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae (A2063G:30, A2064G:1) by sequence analysis. Of the 31 children infected with macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae, 21 (68%) had received 14- or 15-membered macrolide antibiotics and four (13%) had received minocycline before hospitalization. During hospitalization, minocycline was administered to 16 (52%) of the 31 children infected with macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae. Of the 20 children infected with macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae under eight years of age, six (30%) were treated with minocycline during hospitalization. The difference in total febrile days between children receiving minocycline treatment before hospitalization and children not receiving minocycline treatment was three days. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of hospitalized children with respiratory tract infection due to macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae infection was of preschool age and had received 14- or 15-membered macrolide antibiotics before hospitalization. Because macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae is widespread in Japan, the administration of minocycline as a second-line antibiotic in children under eight years of age cannot be withheld when clinical symptoms do not improve with macrolide antibiotics.
