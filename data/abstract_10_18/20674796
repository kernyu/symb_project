Pneumonia is the most common infection that is the leading cause of death. The increasing antimicrobial resistance in major respiratory pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative bacteria has severely restricted the treatment options. Respiratory infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria are associated with a greater likelihood of inappropriate antimicrobial therapy and poor clinical outcome. Especially, treatment of infections caused by pandrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria is a major challenge. Continuous efforts to control the global spread of drug-resistant bacteria are essential.
