OBJECTIVES: Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) causes urethritis and cervicitis, potentially causing reproductive complications. Resistance in MG to first-line (azithromycin) and second-line (moxifloxacin) treatment has increased. We examined the clinical and analytical performance of the new Conformite Europeene (CE)/in vitro diagnostics (IVD) Aptima Mycoplasma genitalium assay (CE/IVD AMG; Hologic); the prevalence of MG, Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG); and MG resistance to azithromycin and moxifloxacin in Denmark, Norway and Sweden in 2016. METHODS: From February 2016 to February 2017, urogenital and extragenital (only in Denmark) specimens from consecutive attendees at three sexually transmitted disease clinics were tested with the CE/IVD AMG, the research-use-only MG Alt TMA-1 assay (Hologic), Aptima Combo 2 (CT/NG) assay and a laboratory-developed TaqMan real-time mgpB quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Resistance-associated mutations were determined by sequencing. Strains of MG and other mycoplasma species in different concentrations were also tested. RESULTS: In total 5269 patients were included. The prevalence of MG was 7.2% (382/5269; 4.9-9.8% in the countries). The sensitivity of the CE/IVD AMG, MG Alt TMA-1 and mgpB qPCR ranged 99.13-100%, 99.13-100% and 73.24-81.60%, respectively, in the countries. The specificity ranged 99.57-99.96%, 100% and 99.69-100%, respectively. The prevalence of resistance-associated mutations for azithromycin and moxifloxacin was 41.4% (120/290; 17.7-56.6%) and 6.6% (18/274; 4.1-10.2%), respectively. Multidrug resistance was found in all countries (2.7%; 1.1-4.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Both transcription-mediated amplification (TMA)-based MG assays had a highly superior sensitivity compared to the mgpB qPCR. The prevalence of MG and azithromycin resistance was high. Validated and quality-assured molecular tests for MG, routine resistance testing of MG-positive samples and antimicrobial resistance surveillance are crucial.
