Due to the recent reports of growing parasite resistance to artemisinins and other antimalarial drugs, development of new antimalarial chemotypes is an urgent priority. Here in, we report a novel series of adamantyl/cycloheptyl indoleamide derivatives bearing sulfonamide and triazole pharmacophores adopting different chemical modifications and evaluated them for antiplasmodial activity in vitro. Among all the indoleamides, compounds 22, 24, 26 and 30 with sulfonamide pharmacophore showed promising activity with IC50 of 1.87, 1.93, 2.00, 2.17 muM against CQ sensitive Pf3D7 strain and 1.69, 2.12, 1.60, 2.19 muM against CQ resistant PfK1 strain, respectively.
