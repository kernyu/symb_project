OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of and risk factors for carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) carriage among patients in post-acute-care facilities (PACFs) in Israel. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A cross-sectional prevalence survey was conducted in 12 PACFs. Rectal swab samples were obtained from 1,144 patients in 39 [corrected] wards. Risk factors for CRKP carriage were assessed among the cohort. Next, a nested, matched case-control study was conducted to define individual risk factors for colonization. Finally, the cohort of patients with a history of CRKP carriage was characterized to determine risk factors for continuous carriage. RESULTS: The prevalence of rectal carriage of CRKP among 1,004 patients without a history of CRKP carriage was 12.0%. Independent risk factors for CRKP carriage were prolonged length of stay (odds ratio [OR], 1.001; P < .001), sharing a room with a known carrier (OR, 3.09; P = .02), and increased prevalence of known carriers on the ward (OR, 1.02; P = .013). A policy of screening for carriage on admission was protective (OR, 0.41; P = .03). Risk factors identified in the nested case-control study were antibiotic exposure during the prior 3 months (OR, 1.66; P = .03) and colonization with other resistant pathogens (OR, 1.64; P = .03). Among 140 patients with a history of CRKP carriage, 47% were colonized. Independent risk factors for continued CRKP carriage were antibiotic exposure during the prior 3 months (OR, 3.05; P = .04), receipt of amoxicillin-clavulanate (OR, 4.18; P = .007), and screening within 90 days of the first culture growing CRKP (OR, 2.9; P = .012). CONCLUSIONS: We found a large reservoir of CRKP in PACFs. Infection-control policies and antibiotic exposure were associated with patient colonization.
