The time course of changes in the endogenous content of salicylic acid, the ratio between the acid's free and bound forms, and changes in the activities of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and catalase in wheat seedling roots under the effect of lectins of two strains of the associative nitrogen-fixing bacterium Azospirillum (A. brasilense Sp7 and its mutant defective in lectin activity, A. brasilense Sp7.2.3) is investigated. Differences in plant response to the action of the lectins from these two strains are established. On the basis of the obtained data, a model is proposed for lectin-assisted induction of resistance, according to which the lectin effect on the roots of seedlings results in the accumulation of free salicylic acid, which inhibits catalase activity, ultimately leading to accumulation of hydrogen peroxide and formation of induced resistance.
