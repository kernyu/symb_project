OBJECTIVES: We assessed the outcome of double-filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP) combined with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) therapy in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-1b whose HCV had not disappeared during PEG-IFN/RBV combination therapy, or who had relapsed after the end of the therapy. Additionally, we investigated factors predictive of sustained virological response (SVR), including host and viral genetic factors, to DFPP plus IFN/RBV therapy. METHODS: A total of 40 patients infected with HCV-1b whose HCV virus had not been eradicated by previous PEG-IFN/RBV therapy were enrolled for treatment by DFPP plus IFN/RBV. Rapid virological response (RVR) and SVR were assessed, and pretreatment factors associated with SVR - the interleukin (IL)28B gene, the IFN/RBV resistance-determining region (IRRDR) and the IFN sensitivity-determining region (ISDR) - were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 40 patients, 9 (23%) achieved RVR and 10 (25%) achieved SVR. The significant factors associated with SVR were IL28B major and RVR, as assessed by multivariate analysis (p = 0.0182, p = 0.0005). CONCLUSION: Patients whose HCV is not eradicated by previous PEG-IFN/RBV would be good candidates for combined DFPP and IFN/RBV retreatment provided they demonstrate IL28B major and have achieved RVR.
