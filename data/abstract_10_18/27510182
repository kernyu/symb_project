Colistin-susceptible isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii often contain subpopulations that are resistant to colistin. Monotherapy with colistin can lead to selective growth of these subpopulations and emergence of colistin-resistant strains. Our objectives were to explore the susceptibility pattern of colistin-resistant subpopulations and investigate if combining colistin with a second antibiotic could prevent their selective growth. Four colistin-susceptible clinical isolates of A. baumannii and one reference isolate were used. The mutant prevention concentration (MPC) of colistin, i.e. the concentration required to block growth of all single-step-mutant subpopulations, was determined by plating an inoculum of 10(9) CFU on Mueller Hinton agar (MHA)-plates containing 2-fold dilutions of colistin (0.125-128 mg/L). Susceptibility testing of colistin-resistant subpopulations, obtained in the MPC assay, was performed with Etest. The MPC of colistin, in combination with rifampicin, was determined by plating an inoculum of 10(9) CFU on MHA-plates containing colistin (0.125-128 mg/L) and fixed concentrations of rifampicin (1.1 mg/L or 4.4 mg/L). The colistin-resistant subpopulations demonstrated increased susceptibility to a number of agents compared to their main populations. These subpopulations were even susceptible to agents that normally are inactive against gram-negative bacteria and all had rifampicin MICs of < 0.002 mg/L. The combination of colistin and rifampicin completely inhibited the growth of all colistin-resistant subpopulations and significantly lowered the MPC of colistin for A. baumannii. Combining colistin with rifampicin could be a way to prevent selective growth of colistin-resistant subpopulations of A. baumannii and possibly the emergence of colistin-resistant strains.
