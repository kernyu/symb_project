PURPOSE: Abnormalities in the constitutive and IFN-gamma-inducible HLA class I surface antigen expression of tumor cells is often associated with an impaired expression of components of the antigen processing machinery (APM). Hence, we analyzed whether there exists a link between the IFN-gamma signaling pathway, constitutive HLA class I APM component expression, and IFN-gamma resistance. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The basal and IFN-gamma-inducible expression profiles of HLA class I APM and IFN-gamma signal transduction cascade components were assessed in melanoma cells by real-time PCR (RT-PCR), Western blot analysis and/or flow cytometry, the integrity of the Janus activated kinase (JAK) 2 locus by comparative genomic hybridization. JAK2 was transiently overexpressed in JAK2(-) cells. The effect of IFN-gamma on the cell growth was assessed by XTT [2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-S-sulfophenynl)-H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide inner salt] assay. RESULTS: The analysis of 8 melanoma cell lines linked the IFN-gamma unresponsiveness of Colo 857 cells determined by lack of inducibility of HLA class I surface expression on IFN-gamma treatment to a deletion of JAK2 on chromosome 9, whereas other IFN-gamma signaling pathway components were not affected. In addition, the constitutive HLA class I APM component expression levels were significantly reduced in JAK2(-) cells. Furthermore, JAK2-deficient cells were also resistant to the antiproliferative effect of IFN-gamma. Transfection of wild-type JAK2 into JAK2(-) Colo 857 not only increased the basal APM expression but also restored their IFN-gamma sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired JAK2 expression in melanoma cells leads to reduced basal expression of MHC class I APM components and impairs their IFN-gamma inducibility, suggesting that malfunctional IFN-gamma signaling might cause HLA class I abnormalities.
