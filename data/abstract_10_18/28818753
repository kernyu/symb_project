Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is a long lasting inducible whole plant immunity often induced by either pathogens or chemical elicitors. Salicylic acid (SA) is a known SAR signal against a broad spectrum of pathogens in plants. In a recent study, we have reported that benzoylsalicylic acid (BzSA) is a SAR inducer in tobacco and Arabidopsis plants. Here, we have synthesized BzSA derivatives using SA and benzoyl chlorides of various moieties as substrates. The chemical structures of BzSA derivatives were elucidated using Infrared spectroscopy (IR), Nuclear magnetic spectroscopy (NMR) and High-resolution mass spectrometer (HRMS) analysis. The bioefficacy of BzSA derivatives in inducing defense response against tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) was investigated in tobacco and SA abolished transgenic NahG Arabidopsis plants. Interestingly, pre-treatment of local leaves of tobacco with BzSA derivatives enhanced the expression of SAR genes such as NPR1 [Non-expressor of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes 1], PR and other defense marker genes (HSR203, SIPK, WIPK) in systemic leaves. Pre-treatment of BzSA derivatives reduced the spread of TMV infection to uninfected areas by restricting lesion number and diameter both in local and systemic leaves of tobacco in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, pre-treatment of BzSA derivatives in local leaves of SA deficient Arabidopsis NahG plants induced SAR through AtPR1 and AtPR5 gene expression and reduced leaf necrosis and curling symptoms in systemic leaves as compared to BzSA. These results suggest that BzSA derivatives are potent SAR inducers against TMV in tobacco and Arabidopsis.
