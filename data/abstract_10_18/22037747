BACKGROUND: This study aimed to analyze the epidemiological and mycological profile of candidemia in intensive care unit (ICU) patients attending a tertiary care teaching hospital in the Himalayan region of northern India. MATERIAL/METHODS: A 15-bed medico-surgical ICU and a 5-bed pediatric ICU. Ninety-one consecutively admitted ICU patients were screened for the presence of candidemia by performing blood cultures at periodic intervals. RESULTS: The recovered Candida isolates were speciated and subjected to antifungal susceptibility testing using standard procedures. Forty-one of the recruited patients (45%) were found to be candidemic, with the majority of patients being in the extremes of age (13 neonates and 15 >65 years of age). Four risk factors were found to be significantly associated with the occurrence of candidemia in our patients - a period of hospitalization exceeding 7 days (p=0.0008), previous use of antibiotics (p=0.001), presence of chronic renal failure (p=0.003), and ongoing cancer chemotherapy (p= 0.041). Ninety-six Candida isolates were recovered from the 41 culture-positive patients, with Candida albicans being the commonest isolate recovered (n=75, 78.1%), followed by Candida tropicalis (n=15, 16%), and Candida glabrata (n=6, 6.5%). Fluconazole resistance was observed among 26% of all Candida isolates and 17.3% of C. albicans isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to the majority of recent reports, species shift towards non-albicans candidemia has not been observed in our center, though the prevalence of azole resistance is alarmingly high even among the C. albicans isolates.
