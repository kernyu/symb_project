Bacteria resistant against various antimicrobial compounds have emerged in many countries, and the age of resistance has just started. Among the more promising novel antimicrobial compounds on which current research is focusing are the antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). These are often less susceptible to bacterial resistance since multiple modifications in the cellular membranes, cell wall and metabolism are required to reduce their effectiveness. Most likely, the use of pure AMPs will be insufficient for controlling pathogenic bacteria, and innovative approaches are required to employ AMPs in new antibiotic treatments. Therefore, here we review novel bionanotechnological approaches, including nanofibers, nanoparticles and magnetic particles for effectively using AMPs in fighting infectious diseases.
