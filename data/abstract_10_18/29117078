PURPOSE: Our purposes in this study were to (1) identify Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains collected from swabs of chronic wounds, (2) evaluate the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa strains to various antimicrobials, (3) detect the presence of virulence factors exoenzyme S (exoS) and exoenzyme U (exoU) in P. aeruginosa strains, and (4) evaluate wound colonization by P. aeruginosa via pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). DESIGN: Descriptive research using a quantitative approach. SAMPLE AND SETTING: Swabs from 43 adults with chronic wounds treated in an outpatient setting in Niteroi City, Brazil, were included using convenience sampling. METHODS: Swabs were collected at 2 points during treatment, 30 to 45 days apart. P. aeruginosa isolates were identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the disk diffusion method. The presence of exoS and exoU genes was evaluated using polymerase chain reaction. Genotyping diversity was determined through PFGE. RESULTS: Forty-eight P. aeruginosa isolates were detected in chronic wounds, and 3 were multidrug resistant (6%). Resistance to aztreonam and ciprofloxacin was observed in 48% and 27% of isolates, respectively. The presence of the exoS gene was verified in 54% of isolates, and 27% were positive for the exoU gene. In most wounds, P. aeruginosa strains had the same genetic characteristics at the 2 time points analyzed, indicating that the wound beds remained colonized. CONCLUSIONS: P. aeruginosa was present in 75% of tested chronic wound samples, and the same clones persisted for more than 1 month. In addition, most bacteria contained virulence genes that were associated with high potential to establish infection. The use of silver in chronic wounds may be associated with multidrug resistance in P. aeruginosa; therefore, it is important to avoid colonization by these bacteria.
