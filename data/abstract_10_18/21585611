OBJECTIVE: Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is the single most important determinant of treatment success. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori resistance to clarithromycin, amoxicillin, metronidazole, tetracycline, levofloxacin, rifabutin, and furazolidone in our local bacterial strains. METHODS: Samples from consecutive ninety patients were obtained for culture and sensitivity testing. Resistance to individual antibiotics were tested using the E-test and MIC(90) read from the strips. Resistance to rifampicin and nitrofurantoin were used as a surrogate for rifabutin and furazolidine. RESULTS: There was a high prevalence of resistance to metronidazole 68/90 (75.5%). No male (34/45 (75.5%) versus female (35/45 (77.7%) difference in frequency of metronidazole resistance was noted (p = 1.000). There was zero resistance (0) to clarithromycin, levofloxacin, amoxicillin, and nitrofurantoin/furazolidone. Resistance to rifampicin/rifabutin was for breakpoints of 1 and 4 mug/mL of 14.4 and 2.2% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although there was high bacterial resistance to metronidazole, the absence of resistance particularly to the key antibiotics used in H. pylori eradication therapy: clarithromycin and levofloxacin is reassuring to note. Continued monitoring of antibiotic resistance should be carried out.
