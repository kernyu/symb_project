We investigated the frequency and clinical significance of macrolide resistance in adult and pediatric patients with community-acquired pneumonia from a Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. The frequency of the A2063G mutation in the 23S rRNA gene was significantly higher in children than in adults (61.3% [19/31] and 13.3% [8/60], respectively; P < 0.001). Patients with macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae infections showed a longer duration of fever (P = 0.021) and required a longer duration of antibiotic treatment (P = 0.007).
