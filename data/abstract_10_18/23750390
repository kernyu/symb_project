In response to the spread of parasite resistance to old antimalarial drugs, the large-scale implementation of artemisinine-based combinations has allowed to improving patient survival and reducing parasite transmission. Even though decreased susceptibility of parasites to artemisinine has been observed in South-East Asia, this phenomenon has no practical implications for travelers with uncomplicated malaria. The combination of artemether-lumefantrine is still very effective and safe, be it for P. falciparum or vivax. Intravenous administration of artesunate has allowed to significantly reducing case fatality rate of severe malaria patients when compared to quinine treatment in endemic areas. Artesunate is also recommended in travelers, but with close monitoring, especially for hematological parameters, in order to confirm its superiority.
