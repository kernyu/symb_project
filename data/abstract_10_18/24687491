We assessed the activity of tigecycline (TGC) combined with colistin (COL) against carbapenem-resistant enterobacteria. Synergy occurred in vitro against the majority of isolates, with the exception of Serratia marcescens. In a simple animal model (Galleria mellonella), TGC-COL was superior (P < 0.01) in treating Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter infections, including those with TGC-COL resistance. Clinical studies are needed to determine whether TGC-COL regimens may be a viable option.
