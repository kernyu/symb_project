Fluoroquinolones have been a class of important synthetic antimicrobial agents broadly and effectively used in clinic for infectious diseases. In this study, the synthesis of a range of fluoroquinolone derivatives with 4-(carbopiperazin-1-yl)piperazinyl moieties at the C7 position and their inhibition of bacterial pathogens commonly disseminated in hospital environment were described. The results indicated that a 7-[4-(4-(benzoyl)carbopiperazin-1-yl)]piperazinyl derivative 5h and two 7-[4-(4- (benzenesulfonyl)carbopiperazin-1-yl)]piperazinyl derivatives 5k and 5l showed more promising growth inhibition of ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa (CRPA) with MIC values as low as 16 mug/mL which is 16-fold more potent than ciprofloxacin, while most of other derivatives maintained potency against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
