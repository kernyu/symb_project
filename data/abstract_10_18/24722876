Miltefosine (MT) (hexadecylphosphocholine) was implemented to cope with resistance against antimonials, the classical treatment in Leishmaniasis. Given the scarcity of anti- Leishmania (L) drugs and the increasing appearance of resistance, there is an obvious need for understanding the mechanism of action and development of such resistance. Metabolomics is an increasingly popular tool in the life sciences due to it being a relatively fast and accurate technique that can be applied either with a particular focus or in a global manner to reveal new knowledge about biological systems. Three analytical platforms, gas chromatography (GC), liquid chromatography (LC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE) have been coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) to obtain a broad picture of metabolic changes in the parasite. Impairment of the polyamine metabolism from arginine (Arg) to trypanothione in susceptible parasites treated with MT was in some way expected, considering the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production described for MT. Importantly, in resistant parasites an increase in the levels of amino acids was the most outstanding feature, probably related to the adaptation of the resistant strain for its survival inside the parasitophorous vacuole.
