The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA) on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced insulin resistance in L6 myotubes and db/db mice. ER stress markers, RNA-activated protein kinase-like ER resident kinase (PERK), JNK, and AMPK activity were determined in tunicamycin-treated L6 myotubes. Insulin resistance was monitored using glucose uptake assays in vitro and blood glucose levels in vivo. Tan IIA clearly suppressed the phosphorylations of PERK and JNK and potentiated insulin-mediated Akt phosphorylation as well as glucose uptake via AMPK activation under ER stress. Furthermore, these effects are completely abrogated by siRNA-mediated knockdown of AMPK or LKB1. In addition, Tan IIA reduced blood glucose levels and body weights in db/db mice without altering food intake. These findings suggest that Tan IIA enhances insulin sensitivity and improves glucose metabolic disorders by increasing AMPK activity and attenuating ER stress-induced insulin resistance.
