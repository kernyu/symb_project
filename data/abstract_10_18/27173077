The first occurrence of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 5 (NDM-5), carried on an IncI1-Igamma-type plasmid of >93kb in a multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli strain in Kafr El-Sheikh, Egypt, is reported. The strain was isolated from a wound pus swab from a patient diagnosed with a fracture of the right femur. This E. coli strain was found to belong to sequence type (ST) 5018 and also to carry other resistance genes, including blaCTX-M-15, blaCMY-42, blaOXA-1, and aac(6')-Ib-cr.
