A novel porous molecularly imprinted monolithic capillary column (MIMCC) based on ternary porogen was synthesized by in situ technique with sulfaquinoxaline as the template molecule. The characteristics of the MIMCC were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, infrared spectrum, thermogravimetric analysis and solvent resistance test. The saturated adsorption amount of sulfaquinoxaline on MIMCC was 2.7 times over that on the non-imprinted monolithic capillary column (NIMCC). The MIMCC also exhibited good enrichment ability to its analogs and the enrichment factors were 46-211 for five antimicrobials. High permeability and imprinting factors as well as good stability, reproducibility and long lifetime were obtained. An on-line method based on MIMCC solid-phase microextraction coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography was developed for the determination of trace antimicrobials in complex samples. The good linearity for sulfametoxydiazine, sulamethoxazole and sulfaquinoxaline was 0.05-10 microg/L, the limits of detection (LODs) were 10.0-14.0 ng/L. The linear range for mequindox and quinocetone were 0.10-10.0 microg/L, the LODs were 20.0-27.0 ng/L respectively. The recoveries were 71.0-108.2% with relative standard deviation of 1.6-8.5%, correspondingly. The results showed that MIMCC could effectively enrich antimicrobials from complex matrices. The on-line method based on MIMCC and HPLC was selective, sensitive and convenient for trace determination of antimicrobials in complex samples.
