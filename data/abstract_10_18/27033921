Recent findings suggest that use of colistin as a last resort antibiotic is seriously threatened by the rise of a new plasmid mediated mechanism of resistance (MCR-1). This work identifies, for the first time in Southern Europe, the gene mcr-1 in nine strains from farm animals (poultry and swine) corresponding to five Escherichia coli and four Salmonella enterica, among which three belong to serovar Typhimurium and one to Rissen. The MCR-1 was found encoded by a plasmid highly mobilizable by conjugation to the E. coli J53 strain. Two E. coli strains carried two determinants, mcr-1 plus pmrA or pmrB mutations, known to confer colistin resistance.
