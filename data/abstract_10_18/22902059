Human health has been challenged by multi-drug-resistant microorganisms for several decades. Herein, we have developed a main-chain imidazolium oligomer (IBN-1) material to combat broad spectrum of pathogenic strains, including drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and fluconazole-resistant yeast Cryptococcus neoformans, while displaying minimal hemolysis (HC(50)/MIC values over 3000) and a very high therapeutic index of 37 for killing S. aureus under inflammatory conditions in vivo.
