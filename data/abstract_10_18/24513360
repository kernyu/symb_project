OBJECTIVE: To compare gatifloxacin resistance in a population of ophthalmology patients who had received intravitreal injections (IVIs) with prophylactic topical gatifloxacin use to resistance in a similar population of patients who had not received IVI. DESIGN: Nested case-control study. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty eyes of 50 patients who received prior IVI were enrolled, as were 50 control eyes. METHODS: Each patient had a conjunctival swab performed on the study eye, which underwent microbial identification and testing for gatifloxacin resistance using the ellipsoid test to determine a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value for each isolate. The primary outcome was susceptibility to gatifloxacin, as measured by the MIC of each isolate. RESULTS: A total of 111 bacterial isolates were obtained from 60 eyes; the remainder was culture negative. There were no significant differences in bacterial species or culture positivity rate between case and control eyes (50% in cases vs. 66% in controls, p = 0.16). The most common organism was coagulase-negative staphylococcus, comprising 64% of all isolates. Resistance to gatifloxacin was observed in 76% of the bacterial isolates and 38% of patients in the case group, as compared with 3% of bacterial isolates and 4% of patients in the control group, a result that was statistically significant (p = 0.0002 and 0.0008, respectively). The mean gatifloxacin MIC was also significantly higher in the case group. CONCLUSIONS: Topical gatifloxacin prophylaxis in those who receive IVI is associated with an increased rate of gatifloxacin resistance among conjunctival isolates.
