Carboxyl groups along poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) brushes attached to the surface of a gold-coated substrate served as the precursor moieties for the covalent immobilization of amino-functionalized biotin or bovine serum albumin (BSA) to form a sensing probe for streptavidin (SA) or anti-BSA detection, respectively. Surface-grafted PAA brushes were obtained by acid hydrolysis of poly(tert-butyl acrylate) brushes, formerly prepared by surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization of tert-butyl acrylate. As determined by surface plasmon resonance, the PAA brushes immobilized with functionalized biotin or BSA probes not only showed good binding with the designated target analytes but also maintained a high resistance to nonspecific protein adsorption, especially those PAA brushes with a high surface graft density. Although the probe binding capacity can be raised as a function of the graft density of the PAA brushes or the amount of carboxyl groups along the PAA chains, the accessibility of the target analyte to the immobilized probe was limited at the high graft density of the PAA brushes. The effect was far more apparent for the BSA-anti-BSA probe-analyte pair than for the much smaller biotin-SA probe-analyte pair. The impact of the swellability of the PAA brushes, as tailored by the degree of carboxyl group activation, on both the sensing probe immobilization and analyte detection was also addressed. This investigation demonstrated that PAA brushes having a defined graft density have a promising potential as a precursor layer for biosensing applications.
