BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Cetrimide is a monocationic surfactant, commonly used for disinfection of hospital floors, equipments, for cleansing of burns and wounds, hand wash, etc. We evaluated whether antibiotic resistant (AR) Escherichia coli isolates from hospital settings (nosocomial pathogens) show any evidence of significant reduction in their susceptibility to cetrimide. Also the response of AR E. coli (nosocomial pathogens) to the action of cetrimide was assessed by studying the ultra structural changes induced using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). METHODS: A total of 165 clinical samples were screened for isolation of E. coli. Eighty two (49.6%) samples were positive for E. coli. Antibiotic susceptibility testing of E. coli isolates was carried out by Kirby Bauer method to isolate AR E. coli. The randomly selected AR E. coli isolate was treated with different concentrations of cetrimide and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cetrimide was determined by broth micro dilution method. This same isolate was used for performing time kill assay and TEM study. RESULTS: The test E. coli isolate showed resistance to 12 different antibiotics. The MIC of cetrimide against AR E. coli was 312.5 microg/ml. The ultra cellular structural changes in cetrimide treated AR E. coli revealed vacuole formation, disaxilization of nuclear material, loss of cytoplasmic granularity, bleb formation and cell lysis. CONCLUSION: Ultra structural changes induced by the action of cetrimide revealed cell damaging changes in the AR E. coli to be dose and time dependent. The results showed that antibiotic resistance does not alter any change in susceptibility of E. coli to cetrimide, which was found to be still an effective disinfectant against a nosocomial pathogen E. coli.
