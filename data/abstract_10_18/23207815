Isolation of bacteria involved in eye infections and their susceptibility pattern to various antibiotics in vitro eye were studied. Different ocular samples were obtained from 354 patients hospitalized in ophthalmology unit. The samples were inoculated directly onto appropriate culture media. Biochemical tests have been performed and microorganisms were identified according to standard procedure. The in vitro susceptibility of pathogens to antibiotics has been studied as recommended by the CA-SFM; 129 bacteria were isolated with a prevalence rate of 36.4%. The conjunctival swabs were predominant in 70.5% (n=91). In conjunctivitis and keratitis, the main causal agent was coagulase-negative staphylococci followed by alpha hemolytic streptococci. Bacteria from contact lenses were represented mostly by Enterobacteriaceae (50%). In uveitis and cellulite, different bacteria were isolated. The pathogens studied were susceptible to most antibiotics tested except Staphylococcus aureus that showed resistance to penicillin G, Pseudomonas sp expressed an average sensitivity to piperacillin and ticarcillin. The alpha hemolytic streptococci showed very low sensitivity to ciprofloxacin. In conclusion many species could be responsible for eye infections. They were sensitive to most antibiotics tested exceptions.
