Recently, wide spreading of fluoloquinolone resistant Escherichia coli is a serious problem inthe treatment of urinary tract infection. To investigate the causative bacterial strains of female acute uncomplicated cystitis (AUC) in the community and their sensitivity to antimicrobial agents, we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 215 female AUC patients treated at our clinics from April 2014 to June 2015. Two hundred and nineteen strains were isolated as the causative bacteria from the patients'urine samples, including E. coli of 179 strains (82%) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.5%). One hundred and forty five strains (81%) of the isolated E. coli were sensitive to levofloxacin, whereas 32 strains (17.9%) were levofloxacin-resistant. To fosfomycin, the isolated E. coli showed the highest sensitivity (93.9%) among all antimicrobial agents tested. In univariate analysis, factors associated with levofloxacinresistant E. coli included two or more episodes of cystitis within the past year and levofloxacin use at the latest episode of cystitis. Inmultivariate analysis, two or more episodes of cystitis withinthe past year were found to be associated with levofloxacinresistan ce (p0.004). To prevent the increasing prevalence of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, it is important to confirm the sensitivity of the causative agents for optimal antimicrobial therapy. The community-based surveillance data should be collected and considered when selecting empirical antimicrobial agents.
