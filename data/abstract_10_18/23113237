Involvement of neurotransmitter receptors and translation and transcription processes in reconsolidation of conditioned food aversion memory was investigated in experiments on edible snails. Injections of neurotransmitter receptor antagonists and protein synthesis inhibitors before the reminder session were found to induce amnesia that was characterized by the possibility of memory recovery in repeated training and under the effect of mnemotropic agent D-cycloserine (early stage of amnesia) or by resistance to the mentioned actions (late stage). It has been shown that amnesia induction by memory reconsolidation impairment by neurotransmitter receptor antagonists depends on synthesis of specific proteins and mRNA, similar to the cases of induction of other adaptive brain modifications.
