Patients with symptomatic azole-resistant Candida albicans or non-albicans candida are difficult to manage. Treatment is largely anecdotal due to the relatively small number of patients. We present six case reports which highlight our own observation in clinical practice including four patients who were treated successfully with topical amphotericin B/flucytosine vaginal gel for 14 days (Stoke-on-Trent formula).
