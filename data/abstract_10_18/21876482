The increased incidence of Multidrug-Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-MT) requires the search for alternative antimycobacterial drugs. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the dichloromethane extract from Aristolochia brevipes (Rhizoma) and the compounds isolated from this extract against several mycobacterial strains, sensitive, resistant (monoresistant), and clinical isolates (multidrug-resistant), using the alamarBlue microassay. The extract was fractionated by column chromatography, yielding the following eight major compounds: (1) 6alpha-7-dehydro-N-formylnornantenine; (2) E/Z-N-formylnornantenine; (3) 7,9-dimethoxytariacuripyrone; (4) 9-methoxy-tariacuripyrone; (5) aristololactam I; (6) beta-sitosterol; (7) stigmasterol; and (8) 3-hydroxy-alpha-terpineol. The structures of these compounds were elucidated by 1H- and 13C- (1D and 2D) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. This study demonstrates that the dichloromethane extract (rhizome) of A. brevipes possesses strong in vitro antimycobacterial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration value [MIC], 12.5 microg/mL). The most active compound against all mycobacterial strains tested was the compound aristolactam I (5), with MIC values ranging between 12.5 and 25 microg/mL. To our knowledge, this the first report of antimycobacterial activity in this plant.
