Achromobacter xylosoxidans is an emerging pathogen in cystic fibrosis patients. The multidrug resistance of these bacteria remains poorly understood. We have characterized in a clinical strain the first resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND)-type multidrug efflux pump in this species: AxyABM. The inactivation of the transporter component axyB gene led to decreased MICs of cephalosporins (except cefepime), aztreonam, nalidixic acid, fluoroquinolones, and chloramphenicol.
