Patients who suffer from a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are ventilated longer, stay longer in the ICU and in hospital and therefore lead to higher costs. Despite the therapeutic potential of the VAP nowadays there is about 10% additional mortality observed. Although the clinical VAP diagnosis is limited (sensitivity/specificity) rapid diagnosis promotes treatment (calculated antibiotic therapy) and improves the survival rate. And in the course the review of the VAP diagnosis of unnecessary antibiotics reduces the resistance development in that area and also the selection pressure.
