BACKGROUND: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections have changed since certain non-multiresistant MRSA lineages have emerged in hospitals. In this study, 99 MRSA isolates, 77 from a public and 22 from a private hospital, were characterized. METHODS: Isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility, whereas staphylococcal chromosomal cassette mec (SCCmec) typing and Panton-Valentine leukocidin genes were assessed by polymerase chain reaction. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing analyses were carried out to determine the MRSA lineages. RESULTS: High rates of resistance were found to erythromycin (96%), ciprofloxacin (93%), and clindamycin (90%). The SCCmec types found were as follows: type II (14.2%), III (62.6%), and IV (23.2%). Approximately 85% of type III isolates was related to the Brazilian epidemic clone in both hospitals. For type IV isolates, 94.4% were related to both USA400/ sequence type (ST) 1 and USA800/ST5 lineages in the public hospital, whereas the USA400/ST1, USA800/ST5, USA1100/ST30, and EMRSA (Epidemic MRSA)-15/ST22 lineages were detected in the private hospital. Among the SCCmec II isolates, approximately 85% were related to the USA100/ST5 lineage. Three MRSA isolates were positive to Panton-Valentine leukocidin genes. CONCLUSION: The study showed that there was an emergence of USA400/ST1, USA800/ST5 SCCmec IV, and USA100/ST5 SCCmec II MRSA lineages in both hospitals. There was a dissemination of them in the public hospital and a polyclonal presence of the MRSA isolates in the private hospital. The spread of these lineages can be facilitated by the characteristics of the health institution.
