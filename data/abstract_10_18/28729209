OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to characterize 32 MRSA isolates recovered from wound specimens of patients in a Hospital in Tripoli, Libya, during 2013. METHODS: MRSA isolates were characterized by determining their antibiotic susceptibilities, genes encoding antibiotic resistance and virulence factors, the SCCmec class, agr type, spa typing, PFGE and MLST. RESULTS: PFGE and MLST revealed that all isolates were clonal and belonged to the Clonal Complex 5 (CC5). They harboured the SCCmecV and the agrII and the spa type was t6065. The majority of isolates were resistant to cefoxitin (32, 100%), penicillin (32, 100%), ampicillin (32, 100%), enrofloxacin (32, 100%), ciprofloxacin (32, 100%), fusidic acid (32, 100%), gentamicin (32, 100%), kanamycin (32, 100%), trimethoprim (32, 100%), and erythromycin (30, 93.7%). The main genes encoding antibiotic resistance were: blaZ (31, 96.8%), ermC (30, 93.7%), aph(3')-III a (3, 9.4%), aac6-aph2 (32, 100%), InuA (3, 9.4%), tetM (3, 9.4%), tetL (3, 9.4%), dfrG (28, 87.5%), fusC (32, 100%). All isolates were PVL negative; however, exfoliative-encoding genes (eta: 25) and enterotxin genes (seb: 32, seo: 32, sei: 32, ser: 32, seu: 32, seg: 32, sej: 32, sed: 31, sen: 29, seh: 26, sec: 26, sea: 6, sek: 5), haemolysin (hla (32), hld (32), hlg (32)) and immune evasion cluster proteins (scn: 32, sak: 32) were relevant. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of a specific clonal spread of a multi-drug resistant MRSA-CC5- SCCmecV in a Libyan Hospital.
