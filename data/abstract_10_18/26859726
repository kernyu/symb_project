PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The occurrence of methicillin-resistance in Staphylococcus aureus, that represents the most frequent cause of complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTIs) worldwide, is a major concern and has been associated with increased length of stay, health care costs, and overall mortality. Although vancomycin is still considered the standard therapy in this setting, limitations of its use in clinical practice are represented by a progressive increase in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) minimum inhibitory concentrations, drug-related toxicity, and the lack of an oral formulation. New therapeutic options for MRSA cSSTIs have recently become available, with promising implications for the management of cSSTIs in clinical practice. RECENT FINDINGS: A number of new antimicrobials with activity against MRSA have been recently approved for the treatment of cSSTIs, and other agents are under investigation. We have reviewed the recent developments, with a specific focus on the possible advantages of new drugs for the management of cSSTIs into the everyday clinical practice. SUMMARY: The new approved drugs for the treatment of cSSTIs are expected to offer many advantages for the management of patients with suspected or confirmed MRSA cSSTIs. The most promising features of the new compounds include the availability of oral formulations, once-weekly intravenous regimens, and broad spectra of activity.
