Candida biofilm infections pose an increasing threat in the health care setting due to the drug resistance associated with this lifestyle. Several mechanisms underlie the resistance phenomenon. In Candida albicans, one mechanism involves drug impedance by the biofilm matrix linked to beta-1,3 glucan. Here, we show this is important for other Candida spp. We identified beta-1,3 glucan in the matrix, found that the matrix sequesters antifungal drug, and enhanced antifungal susceptibility with matrix beta-1,3 glucan hydrolysis.
