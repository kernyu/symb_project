Fungal virulence factors represent a strategy for the design of new compounds with effective activities against Candida spp. Dichloromethyl-4-chloro-3-nitrophenylsulfone (named Compound 1) and chlorodibromomethyl-4-hydrazino-3-nitrophenylsulfone (Compound 2) versus Candida albicans virulence factors (SAP2 expression and adhesion to Caco-2 cell line) were investigated. Candida albicans SC5314 and its mutants: Deltasap9, Deltasap10, Deltasap9/10 were used. MICs of the Compounds (concentrated at 0.0313-16 microg/ml) were determined using M27-A3. Percentage of cell inhibition was assessed spectrophotometrically (OD405) after 48 h at 35 degrees C. The SAP2 expression was analyzed with the use of RT-PCR; relative quantification was normalized against ACT1 in cells grown in YEPD and on Caco-2. Adherence assay of C. albicans to Caco-2 was performed in a 24-well-plate. Compound 1 showed higher activity (% = 100 at 4 microg/ml) than Compound 2 (MIC90 = 16 microg/ml). Dichloromethyl at the para position of the phenyl ring exerted anti-Candidal potential. Under Compound 1, SAP2 was down-regulated in all the strains (P </= 0.05). Conversely, SAP2 was over-expressed in Deltasap9-10 (untreated cells) compared with the wild-type. The Compounds significantly affected adherence to epithelium (P </= 0.05). The tested sulfones interfered with the adhesion of C. albicans cells to the epithelial tissues without affecting their viability after 90-min of incubation. The Compounds' mode of action was attributed to the reduced adhesiveness and the lower SAP2 expression. Saps9-10 play a role in C. albicans adhesion and they can be involved in the sulfone resistance mechanisms.
