We investigated the in vitro activities of carbapenems against 347 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from Korea. While doripenem and imipenem resistance was displayed by only 1.2% and 3.2%, respectively, 21.3% of the isolates were resistant to meropenem. One isolate displaying very high carbapenem MICs and susceptibility only to vancomycin was also identified.
