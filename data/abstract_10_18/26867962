This study aimed to investigate the molecular characteristics and antimicrobial susceptibility of Clostridium difficile clinical isolates in Guangzhou, China. One hundred twenty isolates were collected from Guangzhou General Hospital at the Guangzhou Military Command in China from March 2014 to April 2015, and 9 isolates were identified as tcdA-negative/tcdB-positive (A(-)B(+)) strains. Results showed that all of the strains were confirmed to be ST37 and 0 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were found in the PaLoc region, and >60 SNVs were identified throughout the whole genome sequence. The results show the diversity of the antibiotic and gene mutations present in these strains. All of the A(-)B(+) isolates were highly resistant to clindamycin and erythromycin; showed an average sensitivity to fluoroquinolones; and maintained a high susceptibility to metronidazole, vancomycin, and tigecycline.
