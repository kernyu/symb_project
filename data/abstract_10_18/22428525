Chronic osteomyelitis is still common in developing countries like Nigeria due to the fact that conditions associated with the lowering of resistance to infections like malnutrition, malaria, anaemia, and acute eruptive fever are still prevalent in our society. Various operative techniques have been described for the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis with various outcomes. A case of chronic osteomyelitis of the mandible managed using the Belfast technique is presented. The Patient was followed up for 2 years with no evidence of recurrence of infection and a repeat radiograph at the end of follow-up revealed new bone formation. The Belfast technique is effective in the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis of the mandible and is recommended in the management of this condition.
