We surveyed faculty and residents to assess attitudes, perceptions, and knowledge about antimicrobial use and resistance. Most respondents were concerned about resistance when prescribing antibiotics and agreed that antibiotics are overused, that inappropriate use is professionally unethical, and that others, but not themselves, overprescribe antibiotics. Antimicrobial stewardship programs should capitalize on these perceptions.
