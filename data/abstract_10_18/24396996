Cell lines with high passage numbers exhibit alterations in cell morphology and functions. In the present work, C2C12 skeletal muscle cells with either low (< 20) or high (> 60) passage numbers (identified as 1-C2C12 or h-C2C12, respectively) were used to investigate the apoptotic response to H2O2 as a function of culture age h-C2C12. We found that older cultures (h-C2C12 group) were depleted of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). When we analyzed the behavior of Bad, Bax, caspase-3 and mitochondrial transmembrane potential, we observed that cells in the h-C2C12 group were resistant to H2O2 induction of apoptosis. We propose serially cultured C2Cl2 cells as a refractory model to H2O2-induced apoptosis. In addition, the data obtained in this work suggest that mtDNA is required for apoptotic cell death in skeletal muscle C2C12 cells.
