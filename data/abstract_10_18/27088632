Gastric cancer and Helicobacter pylori infection remain a burden in many Asian countries. In the face of rising antibiotic resistance, the eradication rate of standard triple therapy is declining in many Asian countries. We reviewed the updated epidemiology of gastric cancer, prevalence of H. pylori infection, and antibiotic resistance in Asia. We also reviewed the strategies to improve the efficacy of H. pylori eradication therapies, including the use of high dose proton pump inhibitor, four drug therapies (including bismuth quadruple, concomitant, and sequential therapy), susceptibility guided therapy, extending the treatment duration to 14 days, and development of effective rescue therapy. Four drug therapies are usually more effective than triple therapy when given in the same duration, except in areas with concomitantly high metronidazole resistance and low clarithromycin resistance. The efficacies of different four drug regimens appeared to be similar. However, trials from different geographic areas showed contradictory results, indicating that the optimal therapy should be decided according to the local prevalence of antibiotic resistance. We proposed a prediction model to calculate the efficacy of different regimens according to the prevalence of antibiotic resistance. More large randomized trials which provide information on the antibiotic resistance are urgently needed to build a more accurate and reliable model. It is hoped that we will be able to decide the optimal regimens by routine surveillance of antibiotic resistance.
