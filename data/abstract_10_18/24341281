OBJECTIVE: Polysaccharides inhibiting cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) on tobacco were screened and their influence on tobacco defensive enzyme activities was explored. METHOD: We detected the deactivating, preventing and treating effect of 21 polysaccharides on CMV by half leaf method on Nitcotiana tabacum var. Samsun NN. We detected the variation of enzyme activity of Nitcotianatabacum var. NC89 handled by antiviral polysaccharide. RESULT: Results show that Marasmiu sandrosaceus polysaccharide had good deactivating and preventing effect on CMV. The preventing rate could reach 83.41% when the tobacco was dealt with the admixture of its 200-fold dilution and equivalent virus liquid for 30 min. The inhibition rate could reach 93.15% when the tobacco was inoculated after spraying with M. androsaceus polysaccharide for 24h. Moreover, the diversification of enzyme activity of tobacco-related was detected. Results show that peroxidase (POD) , polyphenol oxidase (PPO) andphenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) activities significantly enhanced. M. androsaceus polysaccharide sprayed on tobacco after inoculating CMV for 24h. Its enzyme activities increased. The peaksof POD, PPO and PAL activities ofthe treatment were 2.74, 3.45 and 2.82 times of the value of comparison, respectively. CONCLUSION: M. androsaceus polysaccharide can increase the resistance of tobacco on CMV by enhancing defense enzyme activity of tobacco.
