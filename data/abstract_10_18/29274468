OBJECTIVES: To examine the population structure of representative carbapenem resistant Enterobacter cloacae complex (CR-Ecl) isolates from 8 different Colombian regions and to characterize their asociated beta-lactamases. METHODS: Twenty-eight CR-Ecl isolates collected in Colombia between 2009 and 2013 through the Colombian Nosocomial Network were included. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by broth microdilution. Molecular detection of carbapenemases and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL), and the presence of Tn4401 was evaluated by PCR and sequencing. Genetic relatedness was assessed by multilocus sequencing typing (MLST) and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (Rep-PCR). RESULTS: PCR and DNA sequencing revealed that 19/28 (68%) of CR-Ecl isolates carried blaKPC-2. Analysis of the genetic environment found blaKPC-2 withinTn4401b transposon in 8/19 (42%) isolates. POPULATION: genetic analysis using rep-PCR revealed four clonal groups. MLST showed a variety of sequence types (ST) among which ST510 was the most common (10/28; 36% isolates). CONCLUSIONS: blaKPC-2 was discovered as the most common mechanism of carbapenem resistance Enterobacter cloacae complex (Ecl) and is disseminated among different STs. Although none of the previously reported major clonal complexes were identified, it appears that local strain lineages are associated with the spread of blaKPC within CR-Ecl in various regions of Colombia.
