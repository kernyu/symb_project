Bacteria of the genus Shigella cause approximately 500,000 illnesses each year in the United States. Diarrhea (sometimes bloody), fever, and stomach cramps typically start 1-2 days after exposure and usually resolve in 5-7 days. For patients with severe disease, bloody diarrhea, or compromised immune systems, antibiotic treatment is recommended, but resistance to traditional first-line antibiotics (e.g., ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) is common. For multidrugresistant cases, azithromycin, the most frequently prescribed antibiotic in the United States, is recommended for both children and adults. However, not all Shigellae are susceptible to azithromycin. Nonsusceptible isolates exist but are not usually identified because there are no clinical laboratory guidelines for azithromycin susceptibility testing. However, to monitor susceptibility of Shigellae in the United States, CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) has, since 2011, routinely measured the azithromycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for every 20th Shigella isolate submitted from public health laboratories to CDC, as well as outbreak-associated isolates. All known U.S. Shigella isolates with decreased susceptibility to azithromycin (DSA-Shigella), and the illnesses caused by them, are described in this report.
