Sulfonamides are one of the most frequently used antibiotics worldwide. Therefore, processes that determine their fate in the environment are of great interest. In the present work, biodegradation as biotic process and hydrolysis and photolysis as abiotic processes were investigated. In biodegradation experiments, it was found out that sulfonamides (sulfadiazine and sulfamethazine) and their N (4)-acetylated metabolites were not readily biodegradable. The results showed that decrease of concentrations were in the range from 4% for sulfadiazine to 22% for N (4)-acetylsulfamethazine. Hydrolytic experiments examined at pH values normally found in the environment also showed their resistance. However, photolysis proved to be significant process for decreasing concentrations of sulfonamides and their metabolites in three various aqueous matrices (Milli-Q water, river water, and synthetic wastewater). In addition, influence of ubiquitous water constituents (Cl(-), NO3(-), SO4(2-), PO4(3-), and humic acids) was also investigated, showing their different impact on photolysis of investigated pharmaceuticals. The results showed that photolysis followed first-order kinetics in all cases. The obtained results are very important for assesing the environmental fate of sulfonamides and their metabolites in the aquatic environment.
