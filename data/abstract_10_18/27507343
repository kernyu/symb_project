Horizontal gene transfer by mobile genetic elements plays an important role in the evolution of bacteria, allowing them to rapidly acquire new traits, including antibiotic resistance. Mobile genetic elements such as conjugative and mobilizable transposons make up a considerable part of the C. difficile genome. While sequence analysis has identified a large number of these elements, experimental analysis is required to demonstrate mobility and function. This chapter describes the experimental methods utilized for determining function and transfer of mobile genetic elements in C. difficile including detection of the circular transfer intermediate and the analysis and confirmation of mobile genetic element transfer to recipient cells.
