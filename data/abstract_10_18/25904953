BACKGROUND: Infection with Trichostrongylus spp. is common among human and herbivorous in most parts of Iran, especially in southern and northern areas. The aim of present study was to identify Trichostrongylus spp. among human population using excreted egg specimens, by the molecular method, in Mazandaran Province, northern Iran. METHODS: Overall, 33 positive fecal specimens were randomly sampled and examined. PCR amplification of ITS2-rDNA region was performed on the isolated egg and then a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) profile was considered to discriminate of Trichostrongylus spp. RESULTS: A total of 33 positive fecal specimens, 29(78.9%), 4(12.1%) were found T. colubriformis and T. axei respectively. Our data appear the molecular evidence of both human T. colubriformis and T. axei infections in North of Iran. CONCLUSION: T. colubriformis was the probable most common zoonotic species causing human trichostrongylosis infection in the area.
