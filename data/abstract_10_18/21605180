Two Candida albicans isolates were collected from a HIV-positive patient with recurrent oropharyngeal candidosis (OPC). One isolate was taken during the first episode of oral candidosis [fluconazole susceptible (FLU-S), minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 0.25 mg l(-1) ] and the second after the patient developed refractory OPC and resistance to fluconazole (FLU-R, MIC = 64 mg l(-1)). Both isolates were clonally identical. Different in vitro studies were carried out to assess putative virulence factors of both isolates. Gene expressions of efflux pumps and CSH1 were determined as well as adherence to human epithelial cells, determination of proteinase secretion and biofilm formation activity. Virulence was studied using a disseminated mouse model. All mice challenged with the FLU-S isolate survived the experiment when FLU was given. However, when FLU was absent, the mortality of the FLU-S isolate was higher than that of the FLU-R isolate with no mice surviving the experiment. In vitro studies showed pronounced growth rates of the FLU-S isolate and a more intense biofilm-building activity compared with the FLU-R isolate. The FLU-R isolate highly up-regulated MDR1 and CSH1. This isolate also adhered stronger to the epithelial cell line. The results showed that FLU-S and FLU-R isolates exhibit different virulence factors, which enable the survival of both isolates in adapted environments.
