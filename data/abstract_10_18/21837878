AIM: We studied the prevalence of resistance mutations in drug-naive HIV-infected individuals at the Bela-Bela treatment site to gather information on the presence of antiretroviral (ARV) drug-resistant viruses in drug-naive populations, so as to improve treatment guidance. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Drug-naive HIV-l1-infected individuals were sequentially recruited between February 2008 and December 2008 from individuals visiting the voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) services of the Bela-Bela HIV/AIDS Wellness Clinic. Viral subtyping was done by phylogenetic analysis; drug-resistant mutations were determined according to the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Interpretation and the International AIDS Society-USA Guidelines. RESULTS: A drug-resistant mutation prevalence of 3.5% (95% confidence interval 0.019796-0.119077) comprising Y181C and L33F was observed; 98% of the viruses were HIV-1 subtype C on the protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) gene regions. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of drug-resistant mutations in drug-naive persons may be low in Bela-Bela after 8 years of access to antiretroviral treatment (ART), and resistance testing before initiating treatment may not be needed.
