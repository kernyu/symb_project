The following study aimed to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of Vibrio parahaemolyticus strains from fresh and frozen oysters Crassostrea rhizophorae sold in Fortaleza-Brazil. An antibiogram was performed on 87 isolates using nine antibiotics: gentamicin (Gen 10 microg), ampicillin (Amp 10 microg), penicillin G (Pen 10U), ciprofloxacin (Cip 5 microg), chloramphenicol (Chl 30 microg), nalidixic acid (Nal 30 microg), tetracycline (Tet 30 microg), vancomycin (Van 30 microg) and erythromycin (Ery 15 microg). All strains were resistant to at least one antibiotic, and 85 (97.7%) were multi-resistant, with predominance of the Van+ Pen+Amp resistance profile (n = 46). Plasmid resistance to Pen, Amp and Ery was detected. Thus, the risk that raw oyster consumption poses to the health of consumers is highlighted, due to the fact that these bivalves may host antibacterial-resistant microorganisms.
