PURPOSE: To investigate the synergistic and bactericidal effects of antimicrobial combinations of any two of colistin, fosfomycin and tigecycline against the nine extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) clinical isolates, including 4 carbapenem-susceptible strains and five imipenem and/or meropenem-resistant strains. METHODS: In vitro synergism and bactericidal activity of combination of colistin, fosfomycin and tigecycline were evaluated by time-kill studies in standard inoculum of bacterial densities of a suspension containing 5 x 10(5) CFU/mL by using 1/2x MIC for each alone, and both 1/2x and 1/4x MIC for any two drugs. The settings of low MIC dosing were allowed to rapidly survey the most active drug combination. RESULTS: The most active combination group was colistin plus tigecycline, showing synergy in 8 isolates and bactericidal activities in 6 isolates by using concentrations of 1/2x MIC and 1/4x MIC, respectively. The least active combination was tigecycline plus fosfomycin, which showed synergy in only 4 isolates and no bactericidal activities by using concentrations of 1/2x MIC and 1/4x MIC, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of tigecycline and colistin may be considered as a last-resort approach to the ESBL-producing KP infections, especially those isolates with carbapenem resistance.
