Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative bacterium of increasing concern due to its virulence and persistence in combat and healthcare environments. The incidence of both community-acquired and nosocomial A. baumannii infections is on the rise in foreign and domestic healthcare facilities. Treatment options are limited due to the acquisition of multidrug resistance to the few effective antibiotics. Currently, the most effective pharmaceutically based treatment for multidrug-resistant A. baumannii infections is the antibiotic colistin (polymyxin E). To minimize side effects associated with administration of colistin or other toxic antimicrobial agents, we propose the development of a nanotechnology-mediated treatment strategy. In this design-based effort, colistin-functionalized multilayered, inorganic, magnetoplasmonic nanoconstructs were fabricated to bind to the surface of A. baumannii. This result, for the first time, demonstrates a robust, pharmaceutical-based motif for high affinity, composite nanoparticulates targeting the A. baumannii surface. The antibiotic-activated nanomaterials demonstrated cytocompatibility with human cells and no acute bacterial toxicity at nanoparticle to bacterial concentrations <10000:1. The magnetomotive characteristics of the nanomaterial enabled magnetic extraction of the bacteria. In a macroscale environment, maximal separation efficiencies exceeding 38% were achieved. This result demonstrates the potential for implementation of this technology into micro- or mesofluidic-based separation environments to enhance extraction efficiencies. The future development of such a mesofluidic-based, nanotechnology-mediated platform is potentially suitable for adjuvant therapies to assist in the treatment of sepsis.
