Candida albicans are the most common fungi associated with biofilm-related infections. Biofilms are defined as microbial communities encased in a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances. The most important feature of biofilm growth is the high resistance to antimicrobial agents that can be up to 1000-fold greater than that of planktonic cells. This review discusses the factors affecting antifungal resistance as well as activity of mono- and combination therapy of different antifungal classes and antifungal activity in vitro and in vivo against C. albicans biofilms.
