In over a decade (2002 to 2012) of Staphylococcus aureus surveillance testing on 62,195 isolates, dalbavancin was demonstrated to be active against isolates that were either susceptible or nonsusceptible to daptomycin, linezolid, or tigecycline. Nearly all (99.8%) multidrug-resistant methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates were inhibited by dalbavancin at </=0.12 mug/ml (MIC50/90, 0.06/0.06 mug/ml), the current U.S. Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) breakpoint. Overall, only 0.35% of the monitored S. aureus isolates had a dalbavancin MIC of either 0.25 or 0.5 mug/ml (i.e., were nonsusceptible).
