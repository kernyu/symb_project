The purpose of this work was to determine the antimicrobial activity of fluoxetine, alone and combined with fluconazole, against 29 Candida strains isolated from patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis. MIC and minimum lethal concentration values ranged from 9.8 to 625 mug/ml for all strains tested. The combination of fluconazole with fluoxetine resulted in synergistic activity against six Candida strains, with fractional inhibitory index (FIX) values between 0.15 and 0.31. An indifferent effect was found for the remaining strains, with FIX values between 0.63 and 1.
