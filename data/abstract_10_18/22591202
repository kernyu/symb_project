The emergence of carbapenem resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa threatens the efficacy of this important anti-pseudomonal antibiotic class. Between 2003 and 2006, an increase in the number of carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates at the Zonguldak Karaelmas University Hospital was observed (Zonguldak, Turkey). To assess the imipenem resistance mechanisms emerging in these P. aeruginosa isolates, they were characterized by amplified fragment length polymorphism typing, which revealed diversity among imipenem-resistant isolates as well as two clonally related outbreak groups. The molecular mechanism of carbapenem resistance was characterized in a representative isolate from each clonal group. Mutational disruption of oprD was the most frequently encountered resistance mechanism (23/27 isolates).
