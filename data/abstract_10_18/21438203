INTRODUCTION: Polymicrobial infections are concomitant or successive infections caused by two or more microorganisms at the same site. The most common types of these infections include orofacial, gastro-intestinal, pelvic (PID) infections, solid organ abscesses (brain, liver, lungs), chronic infections (sinusitis, mastoiditis), skin and soft tissue infections ("diabetic foot", cellulitis, necrotic fasciitis), sepsis. CHOICE OF THERAPY: The most important clues in the therapeutic choice include isolation of the causative agents and empirical data concerning the most common microorganisms of'the affected region. The sensitivity of the most common anaerobic pathogen in polymicrobial infections--B.fragillis, is closely monitored, and according to the latest data it is maintained as such to metronidazole, carbapenems. aminopenicillins with beta-lactamase inhibitors and tigecycline, fluoroquinolones. CONCLUSION: However it must be emphasized that antimicrobial therapy represents only one aspect of the treatment in this type of infections, and can not replace a more adequate multi-disciplinary approach, which often includes surgical treatment.
