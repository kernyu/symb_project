A gemcitabine (GEM)-resistant human pancreatic cancer cell line (PANC-1RG7) was established in vitro by gradually increasing GEM concentrations and cloning cell cultures to develop a cellular model of acquired drug resistance studies. We found that PANC-1RG7 cells exhibited significantly different morphological characteristics from parental cells. PANC-1RG7 cells grew slowly (p<0.05), yet the cell cycle remained unchanged (p>0.05). PANC-1RG7, with a resistance index to GEM of 39.9, showed cross-resistance characteristics to methotrexate, gefitinib, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil. The proliferation inhibition of GEM was significantly reduced in vivo (p<0.05). The known resistance-associated genes and proteins we detected remained unchanged, with the exception of cytidine deaminase, multidrug resistance-related protein and breast cancer resistance protein genes, which decreased; by contrast, 5'-nucleotidase, ribonucleotide reductase (RRM) 1 and RRM2 proteins increased (p<0.05). Therefore, a cell line with acquired GEM resistance was established successfully. Resistance was acquired by overexpressing RRM1 and RRM2 proteins.
