Among a collection of 48 multidrug-resistant pneumococcal strains colonizing healthy children in a small municipality of Merida, Venezuela, we identified sequence types (STs) related to a variety of internationally spreading drug-resistant clones, as well as ST135, thus far isolated only in Europe. The clones invariably harbored one or more of the Tn916-related transposons Tn3872, Tn5253, Tn6002, Tn2009, and Tn2010. Finally, our data suggest both structural rearrangements in certain transposons and occurrence of novel transposable elements.
