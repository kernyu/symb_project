Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris is one of the most spoilage-causing bacteria in fruit juices. Control of A. acidoterrestris in fruit juices by bificin C6165 (Pei et al. in J Appl Microbiol 114(5):1273-1284, 2013), a bacteriocin produced by Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. animalis CICC 6165, was described in this study. Activity spectrum of bificin C6165 was investigated and sixteen strains of A. acidoterrestris were sensitive to bificin C6165 in diluted Apple Juices. In the commercial fruit juices, vegetative cells of A. acidoterrestris were inactivated by bificin C6165 at 40 mug/ml. The inhibitory effect of bificin C6165 was better at lower pH (pH 3.5) and at a higher temperature of 45 degrees C. Furthermore, electron microscopy examination of the vegetative cells treated with bacteriocin revealed substantial cell damage and bacterial lysis. The result suggested that primary mode of action of bificin C6165 was most probably due to pore formation. Although no significantly activity of bificin C6165 was observed against the endospores of A. acidoterrestris in commercial apple juice, the addition of bacteriocin contributed to the reduction of the thermal resistance of A. acidoterrestris spores. Additionally, encapsulation of bificin C6165 with Ca-alginate gel was investigated. Encapsulation of bificin C6165 provided a promising method to control A. acidoterrestris in food juice industry.
