We studied the cell wall of a Candida albicans laboratory mutant exhibiting a high minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC; 8 mug ml(-1)) for caspofungin without bearing FKS1 mutations. This strain showed a reduced level of ss 1,3 D glucan (0.43x) and a higher chitin content (2.3x) than a control strain even when grown without caspofungin. No significant over- or under-expression of chitin synthase or chitinase genes was observed. However, point mutations were detected in the chitinase 2 and 3 genes. These mutations, which may affect the enzymatic activity of the encoded protein products involved in the degradation of the chitin, could have led to an increased concentration of that component, allowing the strain to compensate for its low ss 1,3 D glucan content and the effect of caspofungin.
