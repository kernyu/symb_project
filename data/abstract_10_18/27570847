Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is increasingly being highlighted as an urgent public and animal health issue worldwide. This issue is well demonstrated in bacteria that are resistant to last-line antibiotics, suggesting a future with untreatable infections. International agencies have suggested combating strategies against AMR. Saudi Arabia has several challenges that can stimulate the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria. Tackling these challenges need efforts from multiple sectors to successfully control the spread and emergence of AMR in the country. Actions should include active surveillance to monitor the emergence and spread of AMR. Infection prevention and control precautions should also be optimized to limit further spread. Raising awareness is essential to limit inappropriate antibiotics use, and the antibiotic stewardship programs in hospital settings, outpatients, and community pharmacies, should regulate the ongoing use of antimicrobials.
