INTRODUCTION: Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) is of growing concern globally. The risk for transmission of antimicrobial resistant organisms across several continents to the Caribbean is a real one given its tourism industry. After a cluster of cases of CRKP were detected, several studies detailed in this report were initiated to better characterize the problem. METHODS: A hospital-wide point prevalence study and active surveillance were performed at Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QEH) in Barbados in 2013 to assess the prevalence of CRKP infection/colonization. Following this, a 1-year longitudinal study measured the prevalence of CRKP isolates in the hospital and across all healthcare facilities in the country. RESULTS: In 2013, eleven viable isolates of CRKP from cluster of cases were sent for molecular epidemiology studies. When sequenced, they were found to be the ST-258 clone. Identification of a cluster of cases of CRKP ST-258/512 clones indicated person-to-person transmission. In September 2013, the hospital-wide point prevalence study revealed 18% of patients (53/299) at the hospital were either colonized or infected with CRKP. The infection to colonization ratio was 1:7. Patients who were infected/colonized vs. non-colonized were older (64.7 vs. 48.7 years, p<0.0001), were hospitalized longer (42.5 days vs. 27 days, p = 0.0042), were more likely to have an invasive device (66% vs. 32%, p<0.0001), especially urinary catheters (55% vs. 24%, p<0.0001), and were more likely to have used antimicrobials within the prior 14 days (91% vs. 46%, p<0.0001). Specific antimicrobials, including fluoroquinolones and piperacillin-tazobactam, were significantly associated with infection/colonization. In 2014, the 12-month period prevalence of CRKP in Barbados was 49.6 per 100,000 population and of blood stream infections was 3.2 per 100,000 population. CONCLUSIONS: This point prevalence study identified patients at-risk of acquisition of CRKP and allowed QEH to implement interventions aimed at decreasing the prevalence of CRKP. Organization of a National and regional Infection Prevention and Control Committee in 2014 aimed to strengthen antimicrobial resistance surveillance programs across the English-speaking Caribbean were established.
