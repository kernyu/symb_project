Anti-tuberculosis drug regimens are efficacious, but drug intolerance can be severe and may impact on treatment completion rates. The Enhanced Tuberculosis Surveillance (ETS) system is a case register of all new notifications of tuberculosis in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. We conducted a cohort study to estimate the incidence of, and risk factors for, drug intolerance reported through ETS between 2001 and 2010 and to assess its relationship with treatment non-completion. Reports of drug intolerance were found for 868/67,547 (1.28%) patients in the cohort, and important risk factors were female sex, older age, later case report year and white ethnicity. Drug intolerance was associated with an approximate fivefold increased odds of treatment non-completion (p<0.001). These results highlight the need for better-tolerated drug regimens and close case management of patients at risk of drug intolerance to improve treatment completion rates and contribute to more effective disease control.
