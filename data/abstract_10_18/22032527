The management of hepatitis B in liver transplantation has evolved significantly over the past 2 decades. Introduction of hepatitis B immune globulin and subsequently nucleos(t)ide analogues has revolutionized transplantation for hepatitis B virus (HBV), increasing survival for patients transplanted for this indication. With the availability of new and potent antivirals for HBV, the need for liver transplant should continue to decrease in the coming years. Moreover, the newer antivirals with high resistance barriers will allow effective long-term viral prophylaxis and therefore, prevention of recurrence.
