OBJECTIVES: The relationship between quinolone resistance acquisition and invasion impairment has been studied in some Salmonella enterica serovars. However, little information has been reported regarding the invasive human-restricted pathogen Salmonella Typhi. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms of quinolone resistance acquisition and its impact on virulence in this serovar. METHODS: Two antibiotic-resistant mutants (Ty_c1 and Ty_c2) were generated from a Salmonella Typhi clinical isolate (Ty_wt). The three strains were compared in terms of antimicrobial susceptibility, molecular mechanisms of resistance, gene expression of virulence-related factors, ability to invade eukaryotic cells (human epithelial cells and macrophages) and cytokine production. RESULTS: Multidrug resistance in Ty_c2 was attributed to AcrAB/TolC overproduction, decreased OmpF (both mediated by the mar regulon) and decreased OmpC. The two mutants showed a gradually reduced expression of virulence-related genes (invA, hilA, hilD, fliC and fimA), correlating with decreased motility, reduced infection of HeLa cells and impaired uptake by and intracellular survival in human macrophages. Moreover, Ty_c2 also showed reduced tviA expression. Additionally, we revealed a significant reduction in TNF-alpha and IL-1beta production and decreased NF-kappaB activation. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we provide an in-depth characterization of the molecular mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in the Salmonella Typhi serovar and evidence that acquisition of antimicrobial resistance is concomitantly detected with a loss of virulence (epithelial cell invasion, macrophage phagocytosis and cytokine production). We suggest that the low prevalence of clinical isolates of Salmonella Typhi highly resistant to ciprofloxacin is due to poor immunogenicity and impaired dissemination ability of these isolates.
