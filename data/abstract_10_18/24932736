We report the case of a multi-experienced patient, infected with an HIV-1 strain, with selected multiple resistance mutations. We designed a novel well-tolerated and effective rescue treatment including dolutegravir, rilpivirine, and foscarnet, allowing a 60-week sustained virological response for the first time in 23 years of HIV infection.
