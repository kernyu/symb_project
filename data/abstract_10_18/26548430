Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) is correlated with insulin resistance and isletcell function. In the present study, the subcellular localization and role of ER protein 29 (Erp29) were investigated in an in vitro ERS model of islet beta cells. The INS1 islet cell line was treated with various concentrations of tunicamycin to establish the ERS model. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that Erp29 and antiER marker protein calnexin were colocalized in NIH3T3 cells, suggesting that Erp29 is localized to the ER. The ERS model induced by tunicamycin showed significantly increased expression of binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP)/glucoseregulated protein 78 (Grp78), which is a marker for ERS, and the expression of Erp29 was also increased at the mRNA and protein levels. Of note, ERS was blocked following small interfering RNAmediated silencing of Erp29 expression, as indicated by reduced BIP/Grp78 expression. As an ER protein, Erp29 may have an important role in ERS in islet beta cells.
