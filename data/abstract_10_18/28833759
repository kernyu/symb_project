OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobial review is an important part of antimicrobial stewardship. A novel enzyme template generation and amplification technique (ETGA), the Cognitor((R)) Minus (Momentum Bioscience, Long Hanborough, UK) test, has a 99.5% negative predictive value for bacteraemia and fungaemia. This observational study asked two questions: (1) Does a negative ETGA, indicating no bacteraemia or fungaemia, aid antimicrobial review within 48 h of admission; (2) In this real-life clinical setting, does a negative ETGA mean no bacteraemia or fungaemia? METHODS: Consecutive blood cultures in patients with clinical infection were tested by ETGA. Negative results indicating an absence of bacteraemia or fungaemia were reviewed by the clinical infection team. Antibiotics were reviewed in these patients, and the role of the ETGA result in antibiotic change was recorded. Patients were followed up for a week. KEY FINDINGS: A total of 197 of 246 samples gave a negative result by ETGA. This led to a positive stewardship outcome (antimicrobials changed) in 145 (73.6%) and negative stewardship outcome (empirical antimicrobials continued) in 47 (23.9%). Of the positive stewardship outcomes, the ETGA result supported the decision not to start antimicrobials in 21 (10.7%) patients, to stop antimicrobials in 21 (10.7%), to switch from IV to oral antimicrobials in 103 (52.2%) or to discharge or leave the patient at home in 58 cases (29.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Enzyme template generation and amplification supports antimicrobial stewardship decisions and may have cost advantages in reducing unnecessary empirical antibiotics and antifungal agents and in discharging patients from hospital earlier. ETGA result was consistent with blood culture findings and gave an earlier negative result.
