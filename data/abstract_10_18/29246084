INTRODUCTION: The HIV-infected population is aging and comorbidities and polypharmacological regimens are increasing. To reduce toxicity and drug burden researchers are evaluating the efficacy, safety and durability of dual therapies as a switch option in subjects who have achieved stable virologic suppression. Initially effective dual combinations relied on protease inhibitors but when dolutegravir, the first integrase inhibitor to display a high genetic barrier, became commercially available, many physicians began to use it in a variety of dual regimens, generating several observational cohorts. Areas covered: This review covers the most recent data from observational cohorts and randomized clinical trials concerning the switch to the dual combination of dolutegravir plus rilpivirine and the reasons that lead to consider this option. Also, viral failures, due to poor adherence or to other factors, and drug resistance are investigated. Articles which are searchable on MEDLINE/PubMed and from the main national/international congresses in the field of HIV therapy are reviewed. Expert opinion: The observation period for this regimen is getting longer and data showing its efficacy in maintaining HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL are now consolidated. Metabolic data suggest some benefit in the lipid profile, improvement in bone mineral density and reduced bone reabsorption.
