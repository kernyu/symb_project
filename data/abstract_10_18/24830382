PURPOSE: We report two cases of Alternaria keratitis refractory to the conventional antifungal medical treatment successfully treated with subconjunctival fluconazole injection. METHODS: Report of two cases. RESULTS: After subconjunctival injection of fluconazole (2 mg/mL) 0.5 mL twice a day for 5 days then once a day till 14 days, two cases of Alternaria keratitis refractory to the conventional antifungal medical treatment were successfully treated. No severe local and systemic side effects were found in these two patients. CONCLUSIONS: Alternaria keratitis has a varied clinical presentation and suspicion must be maintained for unusual causes of infectious keratitis. Alternaria keratitis can be difficult to eradicate even with traditional antifungals such as amphotericin B and natamycin. Subconjunctival injection of fluconazole could be effective for Alternaria keratitis unresponsive to conventional antifungal medical treatment.
