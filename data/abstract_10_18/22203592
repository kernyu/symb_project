We describe the activities of RX-P763, RX-P766, RX-P770, RX-P792, RX-P793, and RX-P808 against strains of resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These compounds target the large subunit of the bacterial ribosome and have broad-spectrum activities against multidrug-resistant pathogens. All compounds demonstrated in vitro activity against P. aeruginosa, with MIC(90) values of 4 to 8 mug/ml (range, 0.5 to 64). These novel compounds had narrow MIC distributions and maintained activity despite resistance phenotypes to other commonly utilized agents.
