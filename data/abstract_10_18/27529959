Drug resistance among yeasts and mycelial fungi remains a serious problem when therapy for deep mycoses is chosen. The generic variety of fungal cultures obtained from the sputa of 148 patients with various bronchopulmonary diseases in 1998-2008 was assessed. Most (n = 113) isolates were yeasts of the genus Candida and 39 isolates were mycelial fungi of the genus Aspergillus. The fungi of the genera Geotrichum, Rhodotorula, Saccharomyces, Kluyveromyces, Penicillium, Cryptococcus, and Mucor were much less common. The sensitivity of the obtained Candida isolates was monitored. It has been found that in the past decade there has been reduced sensitivity to azole drugs, such as ketoconazole, clotrimazole, fluconazole, and itraconazole. At the same time, the sensitivity of yeast cultures to pimafucin has increased. Comparison of the sensitivity of cultures of various genera has shown that the azole drugs are much less active against Aspergillus than Candida. The sensitivity of mycelial fungi to lamisil and pimafucin is higher than that of yeasts.
