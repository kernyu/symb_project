Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 has two differentially expressed methionine sulfoxide reductase genes: msrA (PA5018) and msrB (PA2827). The msrA gene is expressed constitutively at a high level throughout all growth phases, whereas msrB expression is highly induced by oxidative stress, such as sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) treatment. Inactivation of either msrA or msrB or both genes (msrA msrB mutant) rendered the mutants less resistant than the parental PAO1 strain to oxidants such as NaOCl and H2O2. Unexpectedly, msr mutants have disparate resistance patterns when exposed to paraquat, a superoxide generator. The msrA mutant had a higher paraquat resistance level than the msrB mutant, which had a lower paraquat resistance level than the PAO1 strain. The expression levels of msrA showed an inverse correlation with the paraquat resistance level, and this atypical paraquat resistance pattern was not observed with msrB. Virulence testing using a Drosophila melanogaster model revealed that the msrA, msrB, and, to a greater extent, msrA msrB double mutants had an attenuated virulence phenotype. The data indicate that msrA and msrB are essential genes for oxidative stress protection and bacterial virulence. The pattern of expression and mutant phenotypes of P. aeruginosa msrA and msrB differ from previously characterized msr genes from other bacteria. Thus, as highly conserved genes, the msrA and msrB have diverse expression patterns and physiological roles that depend on the environmental niche where the bacteria thrive.
