We report a case of Candida glabrata candidemia that developed resistance to micafungin within 8 days of initiation of therapy in a patient without previous echinocandin exposure or other known risk factors for clinical or microbiological failure. Pre- and postresistant isolates were confirmed to be isogenic, and sequencing of hot spots known to confer echinocandin resistance revealed a phenylalanine deletion at codon 659 within FKS2.
