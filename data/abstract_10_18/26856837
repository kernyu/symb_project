The prevalence of fusidic acid (FA) resistance amongStaphylococcus aureusstrains in New Zealand (NZ) is among the highest reported globally, with a recent study describing a resistance rate of approximately 28%. Three FA-resistantS. aureusclones (ST5 MRSA, ST1 MSSA, and ST1 MRSA) have emerged over the past decade and now predominate in NZ, and in all three clones FA resistance is mediated by thefusCgene. In particular, ST5 MRSA has rapidly become the dominant MRSA clone in NZ, although the origin of FA-resistant ST5 MRSA has not been explored, and the genetic context offusCin FA-resistant NZ isolates is unknown. To better understand the rapid emergence of FA-resistantS. aureus, we used population-based comparative genomics to characterize a collection of FA-resistant and FA-susceptible isolates from NZ. FA-resistant NZ ST5 MRSA displayed minimal genetic diversity and represented a phylogenetically distinct clade within a global population model of clonal complex 5 (CC5)S. aureus In all lineages,fusCwas invariably located within staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC) elements, suggesting that SCC-mediated horizontal transfer is the primary mechanism offusCdissemination. The genotypic association offusCwithmecAhas important implications for the emergence of MRSA clones in populations with high usage of fusidic acid. In addition, we found thatfusCwas colocated with a recently described virulence factor (tirS) in dominant NZS. aureusclones, suggesting a fitness advantage. This study points to the likely molecular mechanisms responsible for the successful emergence and spread of FA-resistantS. aureus.
