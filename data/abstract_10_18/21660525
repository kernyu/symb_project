Sepsis is one of the most cost-intensive conditions of critically ill patients in intensive care medicine. Furthermore, sepsis is known to be the leading cause of morbidity and of mortality in intensive care patients. Early initiation of antibiotic therapy can significantly reduce mortality. The development of resistance of bacterial species against antibiotics is a compelling issue to reconsider indications and administration of antibiotic treatment. Adequate indications and duration of therapy are particularly important for the use of highly potent substances in the intensive care setting. Until recently no laboratory marker has been available to distinguish bacterial infections from viral or non-infectious inflammatory responses. However, procalcitonin (PCT) appears to be the first among a large array of inflammatory markers that offers this possibility. Regular procalcitonin measurements can significantly shorten the length of antibiotic therapy, show positive influence on antibiotic costs and have no adverse affects on patient outcome.
