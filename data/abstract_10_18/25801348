Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii infections have emerged as a serious threat worldwide. As novel agents have yet to be developed, understanding the effectiveness and safety of older antibiotics has become a priority. The purpose of this systematic review was to summarise the available clinical evidence on the use of tetracyclines for the treatment of A. baumannii infections. Ten retrospective studies regarding doxycycline and minocycline for the treatment of 185 A. baumannii infections (of which 65.4% were respiratory infections and 13% were bloodstream infections) in 156 patients were available. In most cases (86.4%), tetracyclines were administered in combination with another agent. The usual dosage of doxycycline or minocycline was 100mg intravenous or per os twice daily (usually with a 200mg loading dose for minocycline). Clinical success was achieved in 120 (76.9%) of 156 patients; in 87 (71.9%) of 121 respiratory infections and in 21 (87.5%) of 24 bloodstream infections. Twenty-two deaths occurred in 100 recorded cases. Microbiological eradication was attained in 72 (71.3%) of 101 available cases and documented microbiological eradication was reached in 59 (66.3%) of 89 available cases. Adverse events were noted in only 1 of 88 cases. Overall, although tetracycline-containing regimens showed encouraging results, more data from larger comparative trials are required to establish a role for these antibiotics in the treatment of MDR A. baumannii infections.
