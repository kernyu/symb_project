Non-irrigated and wastewater-irrigated soils were collected from five wastewater irrigation areas in Beijing and Tianjin, China. The concentrations of sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole, oxytetracycline and chlortetracycline in the soils were determined. Abundances of antibiotic resistant bacteria and corresponding resistance genes were also measured to examine the impact of wastewater irrigation. No significant difference in antibiotic resistance bacteria was observed between irrigated and non-irrigated soils. However, the concentrations of antibiotics and abundances of resistance genes were significantly greater in irrigated soils, indicating that agricultural activities enhanced the occurrence of antibiotics and resistance genes in the soils. In addition, no significant difference was observed between previously and currently wastewater-irrigated soils. Therefore, cessation of wastewater irrigation did not significantly reduce the levels of antibiotic concentrations and resistance gene abundances. Other factors, e.g., manure application, may explain the lack of significant difference in the occurrence of antibiotics and resistance genes between previously and currently wastewater-irrigated soils.
