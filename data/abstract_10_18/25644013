Hexose phosphate is an important carbon source within the cytoplasm of host cells. Bacterial pathogens that invade, survive, and multiply within various host epithelial cells exploit hexose phosphates from the host cytoplasm through the hexose phosphate transport (HPT) system to gain energy and synthesize cellular components. In Escherichia coli, the HPT system consists of a two-component regulatory system (UhpAB) and a phosphate sensor protein (UhpC) that tightly regulate expression of a hexose phosphate transporter (UhpT). Although growing evidence suggests that Staphylococcus aureus also can invade, survive, and multiply within various host epithelial cells, the genetic elements involved in the HPT system in S. aureus have not been characterized yet. In this study, we identified and characterized the HPT system in S. aureus that includes the hptRS (a novel two-component regulatory system), the hptA (a putative phosphate sensor), and the uhpT (a hexose phosphate transporter) genes. The hptA, hptRS, and uhpT markerless deletion mutants were generated by an allelic replacement method using a modified pMAD-CM-GFPuv vector system. We demonstrated that both hptA and hptRS are required to positively regulate transcription of uhpT in response to extracellular phosphates, such as glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P), glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), and fosfomycin. Mutational studies revealed that disruption of the hptA, hptRS, or uhpT gene impaired the growth of bacteria when the available carbon source was limited to G6P, impaired survival/multiplication within various types of host cells, and increased resistance to fosfomycin. The results of this study suggest that the HPT system plays an important role in adaptation of S. aureus within the host cells and could be an important target for developing novel antistaphylococcal therapies.
