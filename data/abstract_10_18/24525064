The effect of TiO(2) photocatalysis on the inactivation of an antibiotic resistant Escherichia coli strain selected from an urban wastewater treatment plant (UWWTP) effluent was investigated. Different light sources including a 250 W wide spectrum lamp, a 125 W UV-A lamp and solar radiation, as well as, photocatalysts loadings (TiO(2) Degussa P25) in the range from 0.05 to 2.00 g TiO(2) L(-1) were evaluated. The higher efficiency (total bacterial inactivation after 10 min of irradiation) was observed in the absence of TiO(2) when the wastewater was irradiated using the 250 W lamp. In the presence of TiO(2) a decreasing inactivation trend was observed (99.76% and 72.22% inactivation after 10 min irradiation at 0.10 and 2.00 g TiO(2) L(-1) respectively). Under solar simulated conditions the highest inactivation efficiency (93.17%) after 10 min of irradiation was achieved at the lower photocatalyst loading (0.05 g TiO(2) L(-1)). The concept of "reactor optical thickness" was introduced to explain the rates of disinfection observed. The optimum photocatalyst loading estimated by radiation absorption-scattering modeling was found to be 0.1 g TiO(2) L(-1) for all lamps. The difference between experimental tests and modeling may be due to TiO(2) particles aggregation. Comparative kinetic tests between solar and solar simulated photocatalytic (SSP) processes using 0.05 g TiO(2) L(-1) in suspension showed a quite similar inactivation behavior up to 30 min of irradiation, but only the SSP process resulted in a total inactivation of bacteria after 60 min of exposure. Antibiotic resistant test (Kirby-Bauer) on survived colonies showed that the SSP and SP processes affected in different ways the resistance of E. coli strain to the target antibiotics.
