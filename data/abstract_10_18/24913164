We report here the emergence of VIM-2 and IMP-15 carbapenemases in a series of clinical isolates of carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Lebanon. We also describe the disruption of the oprD gene by either mutations or insertion sequence (IS) elements ISPa1328 and ISPre2 isoform. Our study reemphasizes a rapid dissemination of the VIM-2 carbapenemase-encoding gene in clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa in the Mediterranean basin.
