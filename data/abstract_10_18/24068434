Golgi protein-73 (GP73) is upregulated in cancers and viral infections; however, its role in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) remains undetermined. GP73 was evaluated as a biomarker of HIV progression and AIDS treatment efficacy. Forty-eight HIV patients (</= 350 CD4 + T cells/muL) undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART group) and 18 HIV patients expected to undergo HAART within 9 months (>350 CD4 + T cells/muL) (control group) were enrolled in a prospective, single center, cohort study from May 2009 to Jun 2012. Blood aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), cholesterol, triglycerides, and total bilirubin were assessed at baseline, 2 weeks, and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months (HAART group) or 3 month intervals (control group). Serum HIV RNA level (viral load) was determined by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) GP73 concentration were determined by chemiluminescent immunoassay kit and western blot, respectively. Significant positive and negative correlations in baseline serum GP73 concentration and HIV viral load (r = 0.39, P < 0.001) and CD4 + T cell count (r = -0.501, P < 0.001) were observed, respectively. In receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis, area under the curve (AUC) was 0.79 (95 % CI 0.66-0.92). The sensitivity and specificity of GP73 for correct identification of patients with </=350 CD4 + T cells/muL were 76.09 and 75.0 %, respectively, with an ROC-derived cut-off of 100.6 ng/mL. For HIV patients undergoing antiretroviral therapy, GP73 may be a potential biomarker treatment efficacy useful in AIDS management.
