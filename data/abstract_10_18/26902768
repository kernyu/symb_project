Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been paid considerable attention because of their broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and a reduced possibility of the development of bacterial drug resistance. Fowlicidin-3 (Fow-3) is an identified type of chicken cathelicidin AMP that has exhibited considerable antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity. To reduce cell toxicity and improve cell selectivity, several truncated peptides of fowlicidin-3, Fow-3(1-15), Fow-3(1-19), Fow-3(1-15-20-27), and Fow-3(20-27), were synthesized. Our results indicated that neither the N- nor C-terminal segment alone [Fow-3(1-15), Fow-3(1-19), Fow-3(20-27)] was sufficient to confer antibacterial activity. However, Fow-3(1-19) with the inclusion of the central hinge link (-AGIN-) retained substantial cell toxicity, which other analogs lost. Fow-3(1-15-20-27) displayed potent antimicrobial activity for a wide range of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and no obvious hemolytic activity or cytotoxicity. The central link region was shown to be critically important in the function of cell toxicity but was not relevant to antibacterial activity. Fow-3(1-15-20-27) maintained antibacterial activity in the presence of physiological concentrations of salts. The results from fluorescence spectroscopy, scanning electron microcopy, and transmission electron microcopy showed that Fow-3(1-15-20-27) as well as fowlicidin-3 killed bacterial cells by increasing membrane permeability and damaging the membrane envelope integrity. Fow-3(1-15-20-27) could be a promising antimicrobial agent for clinical application.
