Antifungal susceptibility testing has evolved from a research technique to a standardized and well-validated tool for the clinical management of fungal infections and for epidemiological studies. Genetic mutations and phenotypic resistance in vitro have been shown to correlate with clinical outcomes and treatment failures, and this in turn has led to the creation of clinical breakpoints and, more recently, epidemiological cutoff values for clinically relevant fungal pathogens. Resistance mechanisms for Candida and Aspergillus species have been extensively described and their corresponding genetic mutations can now be readily detected. Epidemiological studies have been able to detect the emergence of regional clonal and nonclonal resistance in several countries. The clinical microbiology laboratory is expected to transition from culture and traditional susceptibility testing to molecular methods for detection, identification, and resistance profiling over the next 5-10 years.
