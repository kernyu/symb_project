Strain LSJC7, with dual resistance to arsenic and tetracycline, was isolated from an antimony tailing in China. Its 16S rRNA gene sequence has the highest similarity to that of Enterobacter cloacae subsp. dissolvens LMG 2683(T) (97.02%). Here we present the approximately 4.6-Mbp draft genome sequence of strain LSJC7.
