Intra-abdominal infections (IAI) are a common problem in visceral medicine. In Germany more than 150 000 patients are treated each year for IAI with courses ranging from uncomplicated disease to severe life-threatening manifestations. IAI represent the second most common cause of septic shock and the second most common cause of infection-related mortality in intensive care. Due to increasing antimicrobial resistance, changes in pathogen spectra and increasing patient co-morbidities, recommendations for empirical antibiotic therapy have to be continuously updated: Whereas inadequate empirical treatment is associated with poor prognosis, unselected broad-spectrum therapy may increase antimicrobial resistances. Illustrated by clinical cases of typical intra-abdominal infections, this article reviews recommendations for antibiotic therapy based on national and international guidelines under consideration of local resistance rates and patient-specific factors to provide a basis for improved therapy of this common problem.
