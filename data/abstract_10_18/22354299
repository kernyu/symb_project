Twenty-five serial passages of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus and 50 passages of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus resulted in no significant increase in NVC-422 MICs, while ciprofloxacin MICs increased 256-fold for E. coli and 32-fold for P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. Mupirocin, fusidic acid, and retapamulin MICs for MRSA increased 64-, 256-, and 16-fold, respectively. No cross-resistance to NVC-422 was observed with mupirocin-, fusidic acid-, and retapamulin-resistant strains.
