BACKGROUND: Appropriate utilization of vancomycin is important to attain therapeutic targets while avoiding clinical failure and the development of antimicrobial resistance. Our aim was to observe the use of vancomycin in an intensive care population, with the main focus on achievement of therapeutic serum concentrations (15-20 mg/l) and to evaluate how this was influenced by dose regimens, use of guidelines and therapeutic drug monitoring. METHODS: A prospective observational study was carried out in the intensive care units at two tertiary hospitals in Norway. Data were collected from 83 patients who received vancomycin therapy, half of these received continuous renal replacement therapy. Patients were followed for 72 h after initiation of therapy. Blood samples were drawn for analysis of trough serum concentrations. Urine was collected for calculations of creatinine clearance. Information was gathered from medical records and electronic health records. RESULTS: Less than 40% of the patients attained therapeutic trough serum concentrations during the first 3 days of therapy. Patients with augmented renal clearance had lower serum trough concentrations despite receiving higher maintenance doses and more loading doses. When trough serum concentrations were outside of therapeutic range, dose adjustments in accordance to therapeutic drug monitoring were made to less than half. CONCLUSION: The present study reveals significant challenges in the utilization of vancomycin in critically ill patients. There is a need for clearer guidelines regarding dosing and therapeutic drug monitoring of vancomycin for patient subgroups.
