OBJECTIVE: To analyze risk factors, clinical features, outcomes and antibiotic resistance of Escherichia coli(E.coli) causing bloodstream infections in children. METHOD: All inpatients with E. coli positive blood culture in Beijing Children's Hospital from January 2012 to May 2014 were enrolled; 112 cases were included, 66 cases (58.9%) were male, and 46 cases(41.1%) were female. Age range was 2 days to 16 years. Among them, 43 cases (38.4%) were neonates, 19 cases (17.0%) aged from 1 month to 1 year, 14 cases (12.5%) were 1-3 years old, and 36 cases (32.1%) were over three years old. We analyzed the divisions to which the patients were admitted, source of infection, underlying diseases, clinical characteristics, antibiotic resistance, and treatment outcomes, etc. RESULT: Forty-six cases (41.1%) were treated in division of hematology, 42 (37.5%) in neonatology, 9 (8.0%) in internal medicine, 8 (7.1%) in surgery, and 7 (6.3%) in pediatric intensive care unit. Sixty-five cases(58.0%) had underlying diseases. Fever was the most frequently presented symptom, as it was seen in 91 cases (81.3%); 52 cases(46.4%) had respiratory symptoms. Among these, 43 cases had pneumonia, 3 cases had respiratory failure, 3 cases were diagnosed as upper respiratory tract infection, 2 had pulmonary hemorrhage and 1 case had bronchitis. Twenty-six cases (23.2%)were diagnosed as severe sepsis and purulent meningitis separately, 14 cases(12.5%) had urinary tract infection. There were 73 (65.2%) strains inducing extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), of which 6 (8.2%) and 10 (13.7%) strains were resistant to amikacin and carbapenems respectively. Resistance rate against other antimicrobial agents varied from 64.6% to 100%. OUTCOMES: 92 (82.1%) cases were cured or had improvement while 20 patients (17.9%) died or could not be cured at the end of treatment. Positive ESBLs (chi(2) = 6.609, P = 0.010), being complicated with severe sepsis (chi(2) = 40.253, P = 0.000) and requiring mechanical ventilation (chi(2) = 34.441, P = 0.000) indicate poor prognosis. CONCLUSION: Patients with underlying diseases and newborns are susceptible to E. coli bloodstream infection. ESBLs infection, severe sepsis and mechanical ventilation indicate poor prognosis in E. coli blood stream infection. Clinicians may use carbapenems as empirical treatment for ESBLs infection. There may be carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae strains infection if patients receiving treatment with carbapenems have no response.
