OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical efficacy and safety of lenalidomide plus low dose dexamethasone for treating patients with multiple myeloma (MM). METHODS: A total of 19 MM patients were enrolled to receive the therapeutic schedule of lenalidomide plus dexamethasone in our hospital from May 2013 to June 2015. Lenalidomide 25 mg was taken orally daily for 21 days and resting for 7 days, and dexamethasone 10 mg was taken orally daily on the day 1-4, 7-10 and 13-16. The regimens were Rd (lenalidomide and dexamethasone, n = 12), and RCd (lenalidomide, ifosfamide and dexamethasone, n = 7). RESULTS: Among 19 patients received 1 cycle of treatment 3 patients achieved complete remission (CR), 3 patients achieved very good partial remission (VGPR), 10 patients achieved partial remission (PR) and 3 patients in stable disease (SD) with an overall response rate (ORR = CR + VGPR + PR) of 84%; their ORR rate was 89% after 2 cycles of treatment. In the early stage of treatment, the renal function was improved in 4 out of 5 patients with renal dysfunction. And the common adverse reactions were hematologic toxicity in 4 patients, 1 degree rash in 5 patients, and gastrointestinal side effects in 4 patients. CONCLUSION: The lenalidomide plus dexamethasone regimen has a good anti-multiple myeloma effect, which can control the disease rapidly and overcome the multidrug resistance in MM, improving the poor prognosis with renal dysfunction, and showing high remission rate in the patients exposed to bortezomib with low toxicity.
