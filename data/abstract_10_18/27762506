Control over biointerfacial interactions on material surfaces is of significant interest in many biomedical applications and extends from the modulation of protein adsorption and cellular responses to the inhibition of bacterial attachment and biofilm formation. Effective control over biointerfaces is best achieved by reducing nonspecific interactions on the surface while also displaying specific bioactive signals. A poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based multifunctional coating has been developed that provides effective reduction of protein fouling while enabling covalent immobilization of peptides in a one or two-step manner. The highly protein resistant properties of the coating, synthesized via the crosslinking of PEG diepoxide and diaminopropane, are confirmed via europium-labeled fibronectin adsorption and cell attachment assays. The ability to covalently incorporate bioactive signals is demonstrated using the cyclic peptides cRGDfK and cRADfK. L929 cells show enhanced attachment on the biologically active cRGDfK containing surfaces, while the surface remains nonadhesive when the nonbiologically active cRADfK peptide is immobilized. The crosslinked PEG-based coating also demonstrates excellent resistance toward Staphylococcus aureus attachment in a 48 h biofilm assay, achieving a >96% reduction compared to the control surface. Additionally, incorporation of the antimicrobial peptide melimine during coating formation further significantly decreases biofilm formation (>99%).
