Given the recent evolution of therapeutic trends, the frequency and determinants of multiclass-resistant HIV infection in the modern combination highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era are less well understood. In this study, the authors characterize the epidemiology of antiretroviral multiclass resistance among HAART-naive patients enrolled in a province-wide HAART distribution program in British Columbia, Canada. HAART and resistance testing are free to eligible individuals in British Columbia. This study was based on patients who initiated naive on HAART and were followed during January 1, 2000-June 30, 2007. Explanatory logistic and survival models were built to identify those factors most influential in the emergence of multiclass resistance. Among the 1,820 individuals in our study, 833 (46%) were tested for antiretroviral resistance at least once during their follow-up. Multiclass resistance was observed in 142 individuals (n = 833; 17%) during a median follow-up of 14 months (interquartile range, 3-34 months) (incidence rate, 0.8 cases/1,000 person-months). The authors found that initial nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based HAART was the main determinant of multiclass resistance. Given that these inhibitors are still widely used, priority should be given to make resistance testing and viral load monitoring a standard part of human immunodeficiency virus care to maximize the long-term efficacy and efficiency of HAART.
