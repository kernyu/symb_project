Modification of aminoglycosides by N-acetyltransferases (AACs) is one of the major mechanisms of resistance to these antibiotics in human bacterial pathogens. More than 50 enzymes belonging to the AAC(6') subfamily have been identified in Gram-negative and Gram-positive clinical isolates. Our understanding of the molecular function and evolutionary origin of these resistance enzymes remains incomplete. Here we report the structural and enzymatic characterization of AAC(6')-Ig and AAC(6')-Ih from Acinetobacter spp. The crystal structure of AAC(6')-Ig in complex with tobramycin revealed a large substrate-binding cleft remaining partially unoccupied by the substrate, which is in stark contrast with the previously characterized AAC(6')-Ib enzyme. Enzymatic analysis indicated that AAC(6')-Ig and -Ih possess a broad specificity against aminoglycosides but with significantly lower turnover rates as compared to other AAC(6') enzymes. Structure- and function-informed phylogenetic analysis of AAC(6') enzymes led to identification of at least three distinct subfamilies varying in oligomeric state, active site composition, and drug recognition mode. Our data support the concept of AAC(6') functionality originating through convergent evolution from diverse Gcn5-related-N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) ancestral enzymes, with AAC(6')-Ig and -Ih representing enzymes that may still retain ancestral nonresistance functions in the cell as provided by their particular active site properties.
