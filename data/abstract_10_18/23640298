BACKGROUND: The Transplantation Society published guidelines on cytomegalovirus (CMV) management after solid organ transplantation in 2010, which provide recommendations on prevention, treatment, diagnostics, and resistance. We aimed to survey international clinicians on their posttransplantation CMV management practices with reference to these guidelines to see if they altered the management of clinicians caring for transplant patients. METHODS: The members of The Transplantation Society were emailed an electronic survey 12 months after the guideline publication. RESULTS: A total of 155 clinicians responded, representing 126 centers in 41 countries. Overall, there was a high uptake of usage of the guidelines. High rates of initial CMV prevention were used (93%), with 46% using only universal prophylaxis, 21% only preemptive therapy, and 33% a hybrid combination dependent on recipient risk for CMV. Socioeconomic and geographic influence was evident, with 26% of respondents from developing countries using no CMV prevention, and more preemptive therapy used in Asia. Valganciclovir was the most common antiviral used, with dosing often below recommendations (33% in infection). Molecular monitoring was used by 84% of clinicians. Management of antiviral-associated neutropenia commonly included antiviral dose reduction or withdrawal (51%). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that there is significant geographic variation in CMV management after solid organ transplantation. Although the majority of clinicians adhere to consensus guidelines, opportunity exists to encourage better guideline uptake.
