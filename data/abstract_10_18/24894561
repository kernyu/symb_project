New verapamil analogues were synthesized and their inhibitory activities against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv determined in vitro alone and in combination with rifampicin (RIF). Some analogues showed comparable activity to verapamil and exhibited better synergies with RIF. Molecular docking studies of the binding sites of Rv1258c, a M. tuberculosis efflux protein previously implicated in intrinsic resistance to RIF, suggested a potential rationale for the superior synergistic interactions observed with some analogues.
