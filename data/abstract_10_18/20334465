Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), which can be a complication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, is characterized by increased pulmonary arterial pressure and peripheral vascular resistance, subsequently leading to right heart failure. In HIV-infected patients, the management of PAH is challenging given the potential drug interactions between PAH-specific vasodilators and antiretroviral drugs. We describe a 51-year-old female with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-associated PAH. She was treated with the oral endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan while taking a nevirapine (a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor)-based antiretroviral regimen. Due to concerns about potential drug interactions with the antiretroviral therapy, her nevirapine plasma concentration, as well as CD4(+) cell count and viral load, were continuously monitored. We observed no interaction between bosentan and nevirapine during a 4-year period. To our knowledge, this report is the first to demonstrate successful, long-term coadministration of bosentan and a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor.
