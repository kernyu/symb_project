OBJECTIVES: Hypermutable bacteria are causing a drastic problem via their enhanced ability to become resistant. Our objectives were to compare bacterial killing and resistance emergence between differently shaped tobramycin concentration-time profiles at a given fAUC/MIC, and determine the tobramycin exposure durations that prevent resistance. METHODS: Static concentration time-kill studies over 24 h used Pseudomonas aeruginosa WT strains (ATCC 27853 and PAO1) and hypermutable PAODeltamutS. fAUC/MIC values of 36, 72 and 168 were assessed at initial inocula of 10(6) and 10(4) cfu/mL (all strains) and 10(1.2) cfu/mL (PAODeltamutS only) in duplicate. Tobramycin was added at 0 h and removed at 1, 4, 10 or 24 h. Proportions of resistant bacteria and MICs were determined at 24 h. Mechanism-based modelling was conducted. RESULTS: For all strains, high tobramycin concentrations over 1 and 4 h resulted in more rapid and extensive initial killing compared with 10 and 24 h exposures at a given fAUC/MIC. No resistance emerged for 1 and 4 h durations of exposure, although extensive regrowth of susceptible bacteria occurred. The 24 h duration of exposure revealed less regrowth, but tobramycin-resistant populations had completely replaced susceptible bacteria by 24 h for the 10(6) cfu/mL inoculum. The hypermutable PAODeltamutS showed the highest numbers of resistant bacteria. Total and resistant bacterial counts were described well by novel mechanism-based modelling. CONCLUSIONS: Extensive resistance emerged for 10 and 24 h durations of exposure, but not for shorter durations. The tobramycin concentration-time profile shape is vital for resistance prevention and should aid the introduction of optimized combination regimens.
