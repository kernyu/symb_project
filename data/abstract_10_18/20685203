Primary screens for antileishmanial compounds use Leishmania species pathogenic to humans that must be handled under biosafety conditions that cannot be adopted or guaranteed everywhere. Leishmania tarentolae, a parasite isolated from the gecko Tarentolae annularis, has not been considered pathogenic to humans. Promastigotes of L. tarentolae have been previously used as a eukaryotic expression system for the production of recombinant proteins and in the amplification of genes involved in resistance to antileishmanial drugs. To validate the use of this Leishmania species in the screening of antileishmanial drugs, the sensitivity of axenic and intracellular amastigotes of L. tarentolae was compared to the sensitivity showed by Leishmania species causative of human leishmaniasis. The ability of L. tarentolae to grow as axenic amastigotes is first described while its ability to infect several mammalian cells has been confirmed. L. tarentolae amastigotes offer a suitable model for the in vitro screening of compounds for antileishmanial activity.
