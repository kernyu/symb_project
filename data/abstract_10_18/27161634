Lefamulin was evaluated against various Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes that were collected from adults with lower respiratory tract infections. Lefamulin exhibited MIC50 and MIC90 values of 0.12 and 0.25 mug/ml, respectively, against the entire collection (n = 822). Similar results were obtained for lefamulin against each of the most common serotypes as well as against multidrug-resistant isolates and strains that are nonsusceptible to ceftriaxone or erythromycin. These data support the clinical development of lefamulin for the treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections.
