BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The emergence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) OXA-142 gene (blaOXA-142) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been reported in Bulgaria and other European countries, but rarely in Asia. METHODS: From January 2009 to December 2012, 90 P. aeruginosa isolates with reduced susceptibility or resistance to ceftazidime (minimum inhibitory concentration >/= 8 mg/L) were screened for ESBL and other broad-spectrum beta-lactamase genes by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. Clonal relationship of the isolates was determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: Three isolates were positive for ESBL production, exhibited resistance to ceftazidime, and carried the blaOXA-142 gene. The blaOXA-142 gene was integrated into class 1 integron. Using Southern blot analysis, blaOXA-142-containing integron was found to be located on a plasmid in all three isolates. Eleven strains of P. aeruginosa carrying blaOXA-17 gene were found. The oprD mutation was found in all the 21 ESBL strains of P. aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the presence of blaOXA-142-positive P. aeruginosa isolates in Taiwan.
