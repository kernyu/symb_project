Ceftazidime-avibactam is a combination of a third-generation cephalosporin and a novel non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor. This combination was recently recommended for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, including acute pyelonephritis, in adults with limited or no alternative treatment options. The current review is aimed to determine activity, efficacy and safety of ceftazidime-avibactam in the treatment of patients with complicated urinary tract infections.
