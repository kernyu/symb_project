Treatment of bacterial fish diseases can be complicated by resistant bacterial biofilms harbouring pathogenic bacteria and causing recurrent exposure of fish to infections. In this study, the effect of biofilm formation on antimicrobial tolerance was examined using three bacterial isolates of the fish pathogen Flavobacterium psychrophilum and two antimicrobial agents, oxytetracycline and flumequine, commonly used in aquaculture. Planktonic and biofilm cells were exposed to a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), to a 3 x MIC concentration and to an environmental concentration level of each antimicrobial in 96-well microtitre plates after which growth on agar plates was measured. The type strain NCIMB1947 of F. psychrophilum was further used to study the development of antimicrobial resistance in biofilm cells. The results suggest that at high bacterial densities (>10(7) CFU mL(-1)), biofilm cells of F. psychrophilum are less susceptible to antimicrobial agents. Furthermore, the results imply that biofilm cells of F. psychrophilum may rapidly develop resistance to both oxytetracycline and flumequine if exposed to subinhibitory concentrations of these antimicrobials.
