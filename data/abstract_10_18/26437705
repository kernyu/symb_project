OBJECTIVE: To determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates of Salmonella enterica isolated from animals and during the pre-slaughter period. METHOD: Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed using the agar diffusion method on 333 isolates of Salmonella enterica obtained from the pre-harvest period represented by transport trucks and pens. From the animals, isolates were obtained from the animals' feces in transport trucks and pens, mesenteric lymph nodes, and cecal content. The specimens were obtained from four slaughtering facilities. RESULTS: The antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed obtaining the following results: 99.6 % (n=332) of isolates showed resistance to at least one antimicrobial agent. The following resistance percentages were found: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 15.9 % (n=53), ampicillin 33.9 % (n=113), ceftiofur 41.4 % (n=138), ciprofloxacin 9 % (n=30 ), chloramphenicol 19.2 % (n=64), florfenicol 33 % (n=110), gentamicin 22.8 % (n=76), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim 24.9 % (n=83), tetracycline 93.1 % (n=310) and tilmicosin 73.8 % (n=246). CONCLUSION: The results show that it is essential to reinforce containment measures to prevent the development of antimicrobial resistances and improve training of the operators, workers, and veterinarians in Colombia involved in the primary production, product processing, distribution, and sale to the consumer, thereby guaranteeing a safe food product and the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents in human and veterinary medicine.
