In December 2012, a 32-year-old woman with no previous medical history and no previous antibiotic treatment had a fever and diarrhea 2 days after a cesarean section in which cefazolin was used as a prophylactic antimicrobial agent. She was transferred to our hospital 5 days after the cesarean for severe colitis. A rapid test of stool for Clostridium difficile toxin A and B was positive. Although oral vancomycin (0.5-2.0 g/day) and intravenous immunoglobulin (5 g/day) were administered after her transfer, 7 days after admission emergency exploratory surgery was performed because of poor response to therapy. Bowel perforation was noted and a temporary colostomy was created without colectomy. Vancomycin (2.0 g/day) was administered via the colostomy, in addition to a vancomycin enema (2.0 g/day), oral metronidazole (1500 mg/day), and oral vancomycin (2.0 g/day). Three days after the operation, linezolid (1200 mg/day IV) was added. She was treated with antibiotics against C. difficile for a total of 18 days after the operation. The same strain was not isolated from other patients in the same ward. Microbiological analysis of the isolate revealed housekeeping gene (tpi), toxin A gene (tcdA), toxin B gene (tcdB), and binary toxin gene (cdtA and cdtB). DNA sequencing of tcdC revealed a base 117 deletion and contained an 18-bp tcdC deletion. PCR ribotyping showed ribotype 027 patterns. The MIC of moxifloxacin was >32 mug/ml, indicating resistance to fluoroquinolones. This isolate was considered as the epidemic strain. Our case of fulminant colitis is apparently the first case involving the epidemic strain ribotype 027 in Japan.
