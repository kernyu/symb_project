OBJECTIVES: Renal neurogenic hypertension (RNH) contributes to cardiovascular morbidity. Renal hypoxia may cause RNH and vice versa, leading to a vicious circle. Hypoxia adaptation is conferred through hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). We hypothesized that acute RNH is accompanied by increased renal vascular resistance (RVR) and that hypertension and increased RVR are countered by increasing HIF-1alpha by cobalt chloride (CoCl2) preconditioning. METHODS: First, we studied mean arterial pressure (MAP) and RVR in innervated or denervated contralateral kidneys in anesthetized rats before and after unilateral intrarenal injection of phenol, a manoeuvre known to elicit acute RNH. Then HIFalpha was induced by CoCl2 in drinking water (2 mM, 10 days) after which we compared intrarenal isotonic saline or phenol injection on MAP and RVR in CoCl2 preconditioned and control rats. HIF-1alpha was determined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Unilateral intrarenal phenol induced immediate rise in MAP and contralateral RVR, and comparable HIF-1alpha upregulation in both kidneys, consistent with bi-renal hypoxia. Removing the phenol-injected kidney immediately normalized MAP. Contralateral renal denervation had no effect on the rise in MAP, but abrogated the contralateral increase in RVR, suggesting mediation by increased efferent nerve activity. Strong renal staining for HIF-1alpha confirmed efficacy of CoCl2 preconditioning, and time-dependent increase in heme oxygenase-1 gene expression stabilization of HIFalpha. CoCl2 preconditioning prior to phenol reduced both DeltaMAP (+10 +/- 2 vs. +20 +/- 3%, P=0.015) and DeltaRVR (+21 +/- 11 vs. +90 +/- 26%, P=0.003). CONCLUSION: Acute RNH leads to renal vasoconstriction and increased renal HIF-1alpha. Increasing HIF-1alpha by CoCl2 preconditioning ameliorates intrarenal phenol-induced RNH and renal vasoconstriction.
