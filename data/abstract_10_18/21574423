Development of secondary immune dysbalance in patients with polytrauma complicated by urinary tract infection (acute pyelonephritis) was observed. In such cases bacterial complications were highly possible, that required the use of immunotropic drugs (cycloferon) increasing the host nonspecific resistance, responsible for Th1 immune response. The cycloferon therapy of the patients with chronic pyelonephritis normalized the lymphocyte electrophoretic mobility promoting efficient recovery of the immune homeostasis. Cycloferon was shown to be effective in the prophylaxis and therapy of infective inflammation in the patients with polytrauma, that was evident of the antibacterial therapy efficacy increasing and more rapid healing of the infective inflammation.
