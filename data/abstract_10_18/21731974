The objective of this study is to perform a comparative evaluation of the prediffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) methods for the detection of sensitivity to colistin, and to detect Acinetobacter baumanii-calcoaceticus complex (ABC) heteroresistant isolates to colistin. We studied 75 isolates of ABC recovered from clinically significant samples obtained from various centers. Sensitivity to colistin was determined by prediffusion as well as by MIC. All the isolates were sensitive to colistin, with MIC = 2microg/ml. The results were analyzed by dispersion graph and linear regression analysis, revealing that the prediffusion method did not correlate with the MIC values for isolates sensitive to colistin (r(2) = 0.2017). Detection of heteroresistance to colistin was determined by plaque efficiency of all the isolates with the same initial MICs of 2, 1, and 0.5 microg/ml, which resulted in 14 of them with a greater than 8-fold increase in the MIC in some cases. When the sensitivity of these resistant colonies was determined by prediffusion, the resulting dispersion graph and linear regression analysis yielded an r(2) = 0.604, which revealed a correlation between the methodologies used.
