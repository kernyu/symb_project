BACKGROUND: The bark of Balanites aegyptiaca (L.) Delile (Balanitaceae) is widely used in the Togolese folk medicine for the treatment of wounds, malaria and skin diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the antioxidant properties and the activity of the bark extract of this plant against some resistant bacteria isolated from wounds. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antimicrobial activity was assayed using the NCCLS microdilution while the DPPH free radical scavenging and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) were used for the antioxidant activity. The susceptibility to conventional antibiotics of bacteria was assessed by an agar disk diffusion method using commercial disk. Phenolics were quantified using spectrophotometric methods. RESULTS: The hydroethanolic extracts of the bark inhibited in vitro the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus in a dose-dependent manner. Bacteriostatic effects were observed on 15 (33%) and 21 (47%) strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa respectively. The MICs and MBCs against Staphylococcus aureus strains ranged respectively from 2.5 to 12.5 microg/mL and 2.5 to 50 microg/mL. Concerning Pseudomonas aeruginosa, these values were equal (12.5 microg/mL). Multidrug resistance was 95% against six antibiotics for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 91% against five antibiotics for Staphylococcus aureus. The DPPH radical scavenging and the FRAP assays yielded weak antioxidant activity, closely linked with the total phenolic contents. CONCLUSION: This study indicated that the bark extract of Balanites aegyptiaca possess bioactive compounds implicated in the free radical scavenging and antibacterial activities, justifying the use of the plant in the traditional medicines.
