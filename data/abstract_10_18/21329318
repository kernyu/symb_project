A total of 171 Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi strains isolated from Nepal, mostly from patients with typhoid fever in 2002-2003, were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility by disk diffusion assay. Selected S. enterica serovar Typhi isolates were tested for MICs by E-test for ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. Mutations of DNA gyrase gyrA and gyrB and topoisomerase IV parC and parE were identified by sequencing of PCR amplicons. By disk diffusion assay, 75/171 S. enterica serovar Typhi isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, choramphenicol, streptomycin, tetracycline, sulfisoxazole, and trimethroprim/sulfamethoxazoles. Multiple drug resistance to the 7 antimicrobials was most predominant among S. enterica serovar Typhi isolates in this study. Resistance to nalidixic acid was detected in 76/111 and 56/60 of total isolates collected in 2002 and 2003, respectively. Nalidixic acid-resistant isolates in 2002 and 2003 showed MIC range for ciprofloxacin of 0.125-0.250 mg/l. Nalidixic acid-resistant isolates contained point mutations in gyrA and parC but not gyrB and parE. The gyrA mutation of nalidixic acid-resistant isolates obtained in 2002 and 2003 had amino acid substitution at position 83 of Serine-->Tyrosine and Serine-->Phenylalanine, respectively. Two different mutations of gyrA were detected among nalidixic acid-resistant isolates. Thus it is necessary to monitor mutation in DNA topoisomerase associated with increases in quinolones resistance.
