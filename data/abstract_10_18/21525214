We used multilocus PCR and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) to determine the genotype and drug resistance profiles for 96 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates circulating in regions of high and low tuberculosis (TB) endemicity in China. The dominant principal genetic group (PGG) circulating in China was PGG1, and drug-resistant gene mutations were more diversified in the region of low rather than high TB endemicity.
