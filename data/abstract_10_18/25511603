OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of normal human renal fibroblast (NHRF) on renal cell carcinoma cell lines. METHODS: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell lines 786-O and Caki-1 were co-cultured with NHRF for assessing the proliferation and migratory capacities of renal cell carcinoma cell lines and the sensitivity to everolimus. RESULTS: Co-culturing with NHRF substantially increased the proliferation capacity of both RCC cell lines (786-O: 2.35 +/- 0.05 vs1.93 +/- 0.15, P = 0.01;Caki-1: 2.35 +/- 0.21 vs 1.24 +/- 0.11, P = 0.001). Similarly the migratory capacities of both cell lines became significantly enhanced after co-culturing (786-O: 1.53 +/- 0.11 vs 0.98 +/- 0.11, P = 0.04; Caki-1: 1.53 +/- 0.11vs 0.98 +/- 0.11, P = 0.04) compared with untreated control. Furthermore, the sensitivities of both cell lines to everolimus (1, 5, 10 micromol/L) dramatically decreased in those pre-co-cultured with NHRF (786-O:P value 0.04, 0.35, 0.18); Caki-1: P value 0.02, 0.03, 0.024). CONCLUSION: NHRF promotes the proliferation and migration capacities of 786-O and Caki-1. And it may be involved in the resistance of RCC to everolimus.
