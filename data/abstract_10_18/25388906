BACKGROUND: In this post-hoc analysis, we determined the influence of single nucleotide polymorphisms in host candidate immune genes on the outcome of drug resistant malaria in Cameroon. METHODS: Human DNA from 760 patients from a previous clinical trial was subjected to mass spectrometry-based single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping. Allele frequencies of candidate immune genes were calculated for 62 SNPs on 17 human chromosomes for their possible involvement in clearance of drug-resistant parasites with the triple mutations of pfcrt76T, pfmdr86Y, and pfmdr1246Y (TY) and pfdhfr51I, pfdhfr59R, pfdhfr108N, and pfdhps437G (IRNG) which were determined by dotblot or PCR-restriction analysis. Differences in SNP frequencies and association analysis were carried out by comparing Chi-square odds ratios (ORs) and stratified by Mantel-Haenzel statistics. An adjusted P value (OR) <0.0008 was considered significant. RESULTS: Post-treatment drug failure rates were amodiaquine (36.4%); sulpadoxine/pyrimethamine-amodiaquine combination (15.4%); and sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (18.1%). SNPs in IL22, IL-4R1, and CD36 appeared to have been associated with clearance of resistant parasites [p = 0.017, OR (C allele):1.44, 95% CI (OR): 1.06-1.95]; [P = 0.014, OR = 1.31, 95% CI (OR): 1.07-1.83]; [P = 5.78x10(-5), OR = 0.27, 95%CI (OR): 0.13-0.54], respectively, with high fever (>39 degrees C for 48 hours) [IL-22, P = 0.01, OR = 1.5, 95% CI (OR): 1.8-2.1] and also in high frequency among the Fulani participants [P = 0.006, OR = 1.83, 95% CI (OR): 1.11-3.08)]. The CD36-1264 null allele was completely absent in the northern population. CONCLUSION: Independent association of SNPs in IL22 and IL-4 with clearance of amodiaquine- and sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine-resistant parasites did not reach statistical significance, but may suggest that not all drug-resistant mutants are adversely affected by the same immune-mediated mechanisms of clearance.
