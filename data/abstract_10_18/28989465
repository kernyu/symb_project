INTRODUCTION: Ulceration of the foot is a common problem among diabetic patients. Infection is a major risk in diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) and many of these are caused by Staphylococcus aureus, in particular meticillin-resistant strains (MRSA). The control and management of MRSA remains a significant challenge and all healthcare organisations in England are required to meet Zero Tolerance Objectives for cases of MRSA bacteraemia (MRSAB). This paper describes a collaborative approach across the health economy to investigate factors contributing to the acquisition of MRSA and MRSAB among DFU patients and make improvements to care to reduce the risk of healthcare-associated infections. METHODS: A collaborative approach between acute and community healthcare providers and commissioners was used to conduct Root Cause Analysis and drive improvement to prevent MRSA transmission in DFU patients. RESULTS: Screening of all DFU patients was initiated after 6 MRSAB were found to be associated with in DFU. In total 15 patients with the same MRSA antibiogram were identified. Following the implementation of actions focused on isolation, wound management, screening and cleaning no further cases were identified. CONCLUSION: This outbreak has demonstrated the value of cross-sector collaboration in investigating HCAI in patients with DFU, improving patient care and reducing the risk of MRSA transmission in these vulnerable patents.
