AIMS: Resistance form of full metal-ceramic crown is an important feature that determines longevity of these restorations. This study evaluated the resistance form of full metal-ceramic prepared with four different design features. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An acrylic tooth was prepared with 20 degrees total occlusal convergence (TOC) angle, 2.5 mm of occlusocervical dimension and a shoulder finishing line. This design lacked resistance form. The crown preparation was subsequently modified by preparing Mesial Occlusal Distal isthmus, placing occlusal inclined plane, and reducing TOC. Four metal dies from these designs were constructed by lathe machine and then 10 metal copings were fabricated for each preparation. Metal coping were cemented on metal dies with temp-bond cement. Force was applied at 45 degrees from lingual to buccal direction with universal testing machine. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: The data were evaluated by Kruskal-Wallis and non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: All features increased resistance form when compare to control group. However, reduce TOC group showed greatest value of resistance. CONCLUSION: Within the limitation of this study, reducing the tapering of occlusocervival dimension is the most effective way in increasing resistance form, although, other features were also effective.
