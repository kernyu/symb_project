BACKGROUND: Berberis aristata is known to contain a variety of phenolic compounds, flavonoids such as quercetin attributing towards its holistic capability of mitigating multidrug resistance. METHODS: B. aristata stem bark extract was prepared and characterized using phytochemical and bioactivity-based fingerprinting. Anti-oxidant and anti-lipid peroxidation profiling was also done in conjunction with in vitro anti-microbial efficacy testing against the test microorganism i. e., New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) Escherichia coli. RESULTS: Aquo-alcoholic (1:1) extract of B. aristata (PTRC-2111-A), containing 3.0+/-0.02microg of QUERCETIN/mg of dried extract, exhibited [flavonoid/polyphenol: F/P (quercetin %) ~ 0.16(0.06%)]. The bioactivity fingerprint profile of PTRC-2111-A included IC50 ratio [DPPH/NOS]=0.064 as functional standardized value having IC50 (DPPH Scavenging)=16+/-0.5microg/mL and IC50 (Nitric Oxide Scavenging)=250+/-0.5microg/mL respectively. The reducing ability and anti-lipid peroxidation equivalent (extract: standard) of PTRC-2111-A with respect to standard was estimated to be 3.44 (ascorbic acid) and 0.78 (quercetin) respectively. In vitro anti-microbial activity evaluated against sts-09 multidrug-resistant strain of carbapenem-resistant E. coli was found to be 25microg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: B. aristata was found to contain a number of phytoconstituents, which acts in a synergistic manner to provide significant bactericidal potential against carbapenem-resistant E. coli.
