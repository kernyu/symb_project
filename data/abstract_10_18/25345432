OBJECTIVE: Clinical information on tigecycline use in serious nosocomial infections is limited, and the efficacy is uncertain. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the utilization pattern and the effectiveness of tigecycline in a tertiary medical center in Taiwan. METHODS: A retrospective study of the clinical and microbiological outcome of all patients treated with tigecycline for at least 72 hours over a 2-year period was conducted in a 730-bed teaching hospital. RESULTS: Data from 133 patients with 149 cases of nosocomial infection were analyzed in this assessment. The mean APACHE II score at the initiation of tigecycline therapy was 22.5 +/- 8.8, and the mean duration of treatment was 11.4 +/- 5.6 days. Pneumonia was the most frequently diagnosed clinical indication for tigecycline use (113 cases, 76%). An overall positive clinical outcome was observed in 75 cases (50%). Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAB) is the most common organism for tigecycline therapy (n = 59), with a positive clinical outcome of 38% in tigecycline monotherapy, 66% in dualtherapy, and 17% in triple-therapy (p = 0.031). The most commonly used combining agents with tigecycline to treat MDRAB infections were intravenous colistin, inhaled colistin, and cepoferazone/sulbactam, with positive clinical outcome rates of 53%, 100%, and 80%, respectively. Admission to intensive care unit was identified as a predictive factor for negative clinical outcome. CONCLUSION: Our pneumonia-dominated study population demonstrated a lower clinical improvement rate of tigecycline compared to previous published data. Tigecycline monotherapy is not recommended for MDRAB infection, but colistin or cephoperazone/ sulbactam combined with tigecycline seemed to yield a good clinical outcome for MDRAB infection.
