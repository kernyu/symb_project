Streptococcus equi subsp. equi is the etiologic agent of strangles, an infectious disease affecting the upper respiratory tract and head and neck lymph nodes of equines. Routine antimicrobial therapy includes penicillin (PEN) as antibiotic of first choice. Streptococci are usually susceptible to PEN and only a few antimicrobial studies had been performed. The aim of this work was to study the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of S. equi from Buenos Aires, Argentina. Ninety-two isolates were studied by the single disk method to PEN, cefotaxime, erythromycin (ERY), tetracycline, enrofloxacin (ENR), trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole (TMS), ciprofloxacin, clindamycin (CLI), streptomycin (STR) and florfenicol. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to PEN and antibiotics with resistance and intermediate susceptibility were tested. High percentages of susceptibility were obtained by the disk diffusion method and MIC values of PEN, TMS and CLI were found to be under the breakpoint values. Resistant strains of ENR and STR with MIC50, MIC90 and MIC ranges above breakpoints were identified. These findings confirm that PEN may be used empirically because resistant strains were not found in Buenos Aires. Emphasis is placed on the rational use of antibiotics to achieve therapeutic success, to prevent chronicity, recurrence of infections and the emergence of resistance.
