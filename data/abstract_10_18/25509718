Implementation of multidrug therapy (MDT) in leprosy control programmes has significantly reduced the global prevalence of the disease in the last two decades. After many years of use of MDT, it is expected that drug resistance in Mycobacterium leprae may emerge. This is a major concern, especially during the stage of elimination. In the present study, slit-skin smears were collected from 140 leprosy relapse cases from different Leprosy Mission hospitals across India. DNA extracted from 111 (79%) of these samples was analysed for the genes associated with drug resistance in M. leprae. More than 90% of the patients relapsed as multibacillary (MB) cases. In our study, four (3.6%) of the DNA samples analysed showed mutations associated with rifampicin resistance. We also observed that mutations associated with resistance to dapsone and ofloxacin were observed in 9 (8.1%) of the DNA samples each; two samples had both dapsone and ofloxacin resistance. Further surveillance and appropriate interventions are needed to ensure the continued success of chemotherapy for leprosy.
