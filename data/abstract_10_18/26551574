The incidence of Candida bloodstream infection (BSI) has increased during the past decades. Species distribution is changing worldwide, and non-albicans Candida spp. are becoming more prevalent. Acquired resistance to antifungal agents has been documented in several reports. The aim of our study was to assess the epidemiology and antifungal susceptibility of Candida isolates from BSI at our institute. The incidence of Candida BSI increased during the first four years of our investigation, from 1.7 to 3.5 episodes / 10 000 admissions, then dropped to 2.66 episodes / 10 000 admissions in the last year. The most frequently isolated species was C. albicans (63%), followed by C. glabrata (13%), C. parapsilosis (10.2%), C. tropicalis (9.3%), and C. krusei (3.7%). One isolate each of C. kefyr, C. fabianii and C. inconspicua were detected. The percentage of C. albicans remained stable throughout the study period. The most frequent risk factors of Candida BSI in our patient population were intensive care treatment (60.4%), abdominal surgery (52.5%), and solid malignancy (30.7%). All isolates were wild-type organisms, no acquired antifungal resistance was detected.
