7-Chloroquinoline-based antimalarial drugs are effective in the inhibition of hemozoin formation in the food vacuole of the Plasmodium parasite, the causative agent of malaria. We synthesized five series of ferroquine (FQ) and phenylequine (PQ) derivatives, which display good in vitro efficacy toward both the chloroquine-sensitive (CQS) NF54 (IC50 : 4.2 nm) and chloroquine-resistant (CQR) Dd2 (IC50 : 33.7 nm) strains of P. falciparum. Several compounds were found to have good inhibitory activity against beta-hematin formation in an NP-40 detergent assay, with IC50 values ranging between 10.4 and 19.2 mum.
