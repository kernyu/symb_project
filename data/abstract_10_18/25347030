INTRODUCTION: Chronic hepatitis C infection is a global disease with 160 million people infected worldwide. Until recently, therapy was characterized by long duration, suboptimal success rates and significant adverse drug reactions. The development of direct-acting antivirals initiated a dramatic change in the treatment of hepatitis C. AREAS COVERED: This review covers the development of the novel NS5A inhibitor ombitasvir (ABT-267) and its clinical evaluation in Phase I to III trials as monotherapy and in combination with the NS3/4A inhibitor ABT-450/r and the non-nucleoside NS5B inhibitor dasabuvir (ABT-333) +/- ribavirin. EXPERT OPINION: Ombitasvir (ABT-267) is a potent inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus protein NS5A, has favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics and is active in the picomolar range against genotype 1 - 6. In patients with genotype 1 and 4, 12-week combination treatment with ombitasvir, dasabuvir and ABT-450/r plus ribavirin was highly effective and resulted in 12-week sustained virological response rates higher than 95% in treatment-naove and treatment-experienced patients. In liver transplant recipients with genotype 1 hepatitis C, success rates in the same range can be expected after 24 weeks of treatment according to preliminary trial results. Genotype 1a patients with compensated cirrhosis who were prior nonresponders benefit from a treatment duration of 24 weeks.
