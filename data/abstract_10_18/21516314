Cells of a new isolate of Rhodococcus qingshengii harboring nitrile hydratase converted 2-amino-2,3-dimethylbutyronitrile into 2-amino-2,3-dimethylbutyramide (ADBA). Cells also hydrated a broad range of substrates including saturated, unsaturated and cyclic aliphatic nitriles. The microorganism tolerated KCN and ADBA up to 5 mM and 40 g/l, respectively. At 10 degrees C, ADBA reached 33.8 g/l (yield 84.5%) which was 2.5 times that at 30 degrees C.
