MIC values were generated for caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin against 106 isolates of C. lusitaniae, and these values were compared to established epidemiologic cutoff values. The majority of isolates were wild type both by MIC value as well as by FKS1 hotspot sequencing. Although C. lusitaniae isolates have MIC values to the echinocandins that are elevated compared to other common species, with regard to known mechanisms of resistance to the echinocandins, isolates with MIC values at or below the epidemiological cutoff values of 0.5 and 1 mug/mL for micafungin and anidulafungin, respectively, should be considered wild type.
