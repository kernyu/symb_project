Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) are bacteria that are often resistant to most classes of antibiotics and cause health care-associated infections with high mortality rates. Among CRE, strains that carry plasmid-encoded carbapenemase enzymes that inactivate carbapenem antibiotics are of greatest public health concern because of their potential for rapid global dissemination, as evidenced by the increasing distribution of CRE that produce the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase and the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase. Newly described resistance in Enterobacteriaceae, such as plasmid-mediated resistance to the last-line antimicrobial colistin, recently detected in China, and resistance to the newly approved antimicrobial, ceftazidime-avibactam, identified from a U.S. K. pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing isolate, highlight the continued urgency to delay spread of CRE. Monitoring the emergence of carbapenemases is crucial to limiting their spread; identification of patients carrying carbapenemase-producing CRE should result in the institution of transmission-based precautions and enhanced environmental cleaning to prevent transmission.* The OXA-48 carbapenemase was first identified in Enterobacteriaceae in Turkey in 2001, and OXA-48-like variants have subsequently been reported around the world. The first U.S. reports of OXA-48-like carbapenemases were published in 2013 and included retrospectively identified isolates from 2009 and two isolates collected in 2012 from patients in Virginia who had recently been hospitalized outside the United States. Although there are limited additional published reports from the United States, CDC continues to receive reprots of these organisms. This report describes patients identified as carrying CRE producing OXA-48-like carbapenemases in the United States during June 2010-August 2015.
