BACKGROUND: Travellers' diarrhoea, a common problem worldwide with significant medical impact, is generally treated with anti-diarrhoeal agents and fluid replacement. Systemic antibiotics are also used in selected cases, but these may be associated with adverse effects, bacterial resistance and drug-drug interactions. AIM: To review the clinical evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of the minimally absorbed oral antibiotic rifaximin in travellers' diarrhoea. METHODS: PubMed and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Clinical Trials (to January 2010) and International Society of Travel Medicine congress abstracts (2003-2009) were searched to identify relevant publications. RESULTS: A total of 10 publications were included in the analysis. When administered three times daily for 3 days, rifaximin is superior to placebo or loperamide; it is at least as effective as ciprofloxacin in reducing duration of illness and restoring wellbeing in patients with travellers' diarrhoea, both with and without identification of a pathogen, as well as in diarrhoea caused by Escherichia coli infection. Rifaximin demonstrates only minimal potential for development of bacterial resistance and for cytochrome P450-mediated drug-drug interactions, and its tolerability profile is similar to that of placebo. CONCLUSION: When antibiotic therapy is warranted in uncomplicated travellers' diarrhoea, rifaximin may be considered as a first-line treatment option because of its favourable efficacy, tolerability and safety profiles.
