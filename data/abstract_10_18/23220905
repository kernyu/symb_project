Rectal contents of beef cattle and pigs were collected between October 2010 and February 2011 in Japan. Campylobacter jejuni were isolated from 36.0% (90/250) of beef cattle from 88.0% (22/25) of beef farms. C. coli were isolated from 3.6% (9/250) of beef cattle from 16.0% (4/25) of beef farms and from 42.4% (106/250) of pigs from all 25 pig farms. As to enrofloxacin, 40.0% (36/90) of C. jejuni isolates and 66.7% (6/9) of C. coli isolates from beef cattle and 44.3% (47/106) of C. coli isolates from pigs were resistant. Additionally, 15.1% (16/106) of C. coli isolates from pigs were resistant to erythromycin and enrofloxacin. The high prevalence of Campylobacter carriers and significant antimicrobial resistance of the isolates were found.
