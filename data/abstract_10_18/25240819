Bacteria causing chronic infections predominately grow as surface-attached, sessile communities known as biofilms. Biofilm-related infections including cystic fibrosis lung infection, chronic and recurrent otitis media, chronic wounds and implant- and catheter-associated infections, are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality and financial cost. Chronic biofilm-based infections are recalcitrant to conventional antibiotic therapy and are often unperturbed by host immune responses such as phagocytosis, despite a sustained presence of host inflammation. The diagnosis of clinically important biofilm infections is often difficult as Koch's postulates are rarely met. If treatment is required, surgical removal of the infected implant, or debridement of wound or bone, is the most efficient means of eradicating a clinically significant biofilm. New approaches to treatment are under investigation.
