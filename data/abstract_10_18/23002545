OBJECTIVE: To investigate human enterovirus 71 (EV71) resistance to type I interferon induced antiviral effect. METHODS: After type I interferons (alpha, beta) were incubated with HeLa cells, recombinant type I herpes simple virus (HSV-1) with green fluorescent protein (GFP) was inoculated onto the HeLa cells. HSV-1 proliferation was observed by GFP expression and PCR. After EV71 was inoculated onto HeLa cells incubated with the same quantity of interferon, proliferation of EV71 were detected by RT-PCR of 2A gene. RESULTS: Recombinant HSV-1 GFP expression and viral DNA replication obviously decreased in HeLa cells incubated with type I interferon (alpha, beta). However, EV71 effectively proliferated in the interferon irritated HeLa cell by RT-PCR. CONCLUSION: HeLa cell irritated by type I interferon (alpha, beta) produced antiviral substance that inhibits HSV-1 proliferation. EV71 resisted the antiviral substance induced by type I interferon and could significantly replicate in the HeLa cells.
