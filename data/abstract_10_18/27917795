PURPOSE: A bacteriophage is a virus that infects and replicates within a bacterium following the injection of phage genome into the bacterial cytoplasm. They are seen as a possible therapy for multi-drug-resistant strains of many bacteria. The aim of this study is to evaluate the lytic activity of the Pyo, Intesti and Fersisi bacteriophage cocktails on P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. METHODS: Ten different S. aureus and P. aeruginosa strains, which were isolated from hospitalized patients in Turkey, were used in the study. The identification and antibiotic susceptibility of the isolates were performed using Vitec 2 system. The identities of the isolates were confirmed by a species-specific Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay. Lytic activity of the bacteriophage cocktails on bacteria was determined by spot test and plaque assay methods. RESULTS: The lytic activity of the Pyo phage cocktail was evaluated on P. aeruginosa and S. aureus strains. It was found that eight isolates of MDR S. aureus were susceptible to Pyo phage cocktail and two isolates were resistant. Nine isolates of antibiotic-resistant P. aeruginosa were found to be susceptible to this phage cocktail and one isolate was resistant. Thus, the Pyo, Intesti and Fersisi cocktails are very effective in treating clinical strains of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa and S. aureus isolated in Turkey. CONCLUSION: The Pyo, Intesti and Fersisi cocktails may prove useful in the treatment of various infections caused by those bacteria.
