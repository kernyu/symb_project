A randomized, controlled, blinded clinical trial was performed at a research feedlot in western Canada. Auction-market-derived steers (n = 288) were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments: 1) no antimicrobials on arrival; 2) oxytetracycline in the starter ration for 14 d; and 3) long-acting oxytetracycline subcutaneously on day 0. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of 7 antimicrobials were determined for 3 generic fecal E. coli isolates per animal on arrival and throughout the feeding period. There was a low prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in generic E. coli isolates from calves on arrival. There were increased proportions of cattle with resistant E. coli isolates early in the feeding period among calves in groups 2 and 3. Individual animal treatments were not associated with increased proportions of cattle with resistant E. coli isolates preslaughter. There was no difference in the proportion of animals with E. coli isolates resistant to tetracycline between the treatment groups preslaughter. However, there were significantly more animals with tetracycline resistant isolates of E. coli preslaughter than at arrival.
