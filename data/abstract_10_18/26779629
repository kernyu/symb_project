Programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and ligand (PD-L1) provide an important escape mechanism from immune attack, and blockade therapy of these proteins show promising clinical benefits in many types of cancer. PD-L1 can be induced by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), hypoxia, or toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated pathways that confer adaptive immune resistance, or upregulated by oncogenic signals leading to constitutive expression and resulting in intrinsic immune resistance. The PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockade, which targets regulatory pathways in T cells to overcome immune resistance, is correlated to PD-L1 expression pattern and the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Meanwhile, immunogenic mutation loads show significant response to checkpoint blockade, which is probably due to PD-1/L1 status and TIL content. Finally, the clinical strategies to design effective checkpoint-targeting immunotherapies are based on the classification of inducible/constitutive expression of PD-L1 and the presence of TILs.
