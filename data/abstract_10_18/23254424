The LEADER surveillance program monitors the in vitro activity of linezolid and comparator agents against Gram-positive bacteria in the United States. In its eighth consecutive year (2011), a total of 60 medical centers from the United States, including seven medical centers specializing in children's health care contributed a total of 7,303 Gram-positive pathogens. The MIC(90) value for Staphylococcus aureus was 2 mug/ml, and for coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans group streptococci, the MIC(90) was 1 mug/ml. The "all organism" linezolid-resistant and nonsusceptible rate was only 0.19%.
