Twenty-eight Escherichia coli isolates from various animal and environmental sources with defined tetracycline-resistance genotypes for tet(A), tet(B), and tet(C) were tested for their susceptibility to tetracycline by means of both broth microdilution and Etest. All tet(C)-positive isolates had tetracycline minimum inhibitory concentrations clustering around an intermediate susceptibility range of 2 to 16 microg/mL. Detecting tet(C)-positive isolates by means of susceptibility testing may therefore be difficult with use of the current breakpoint for tetracycline of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines.
