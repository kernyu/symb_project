We present the first case of candidemia due to Candida quercitrusa in a pediatric patient. The identification of the isolate was protracted and ultimately dependent upon sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region. To further define the antifungal susceptibility characteristics of this species, we performed antifungal susceptibility testing of clinical and type strains. In light of the antifungal susceptibility testing results, we caution against the use of fluconazole for treating C. quercitrusa infections.
