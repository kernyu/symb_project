Gold nanoparticles (Aunp) through biogenetic processes have induced enormous interest for lower toxicity and precise applications. A rapid, one pot synthesis for uniformly sized gold nanoparticles was developed using polyphenolic compound quercetin. Reduction process was followed at low temperatures in a simple bath type sonicator. Nanoparticle plasmon response was recorded at 540 nm and the average size in TEM was observed at 15.07 nm. Detailed X-ray diffraction (XRD) observations proved fcc crystalline structure of metallic gold and the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis has confirmed nanoparticles conjugation with quercetin. Leishmaniasis, is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) classified by the World Health Organization (WHO). The leishmanial parasite multiply in host macrophages and most strains have developed drug resistance to available chemotherapeutics. Drug delivery is therefore a major problem in macrophage specific leishmanial parasite infections. New quercetin conjugated gold nanoparticles (QAunp) were successfully evaluated for the first time against leishmanial macrophage infections. Antileishmanial efficiency of QAunp was established against wild type (IC50 15+/-3), sodium stibogluconate resistant strain (IC50 40+/-8) and the paramomycin resistant (IC50 30+/-6) strains. Macrophage uptake of QAunp was complete within an hour as observed in TEM experiments.
