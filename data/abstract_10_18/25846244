UNLABELLED: The inhibition of efflux pumps is an attractive and powerful response to the emergence of bacteria resistant to antibiotics. Essential oils (EOs) from Salvia fruticosa, Salvia officinalis and Salvia sclarea reduce the minimal inhibition concentration of tetracycline, decrease efflux of antibiotic and decrease the expression of tet(K) gene in tetracycline resistant clinical isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis. In all the cases S. fruticosa was the best one. By using checkerboard and time-killing methods, we found synergistic interactions of EOs with tetracycline. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our data from molecular and functional analyses of inhibitory effect of Salvia's essential oils, namely from S. fruticosa, on Tet(K) pump of Staphylococcus epidermidis and from modulatory studies may be the starting point for consecutive study of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters and their perspective use in combination therapy. Combination of antibiotic with efflux pump inhibitor would be expected to re-establish susceptibility of the bacteria to antibiotics that became no longer effective due to bacterial resistance through the efflux pumps. The inhibition of an efflux pump can potentially improve the clinical efficacy of an antibiotic and simultaneously decrease the selection of resistant mutants.
