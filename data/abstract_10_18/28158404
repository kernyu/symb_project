The emergence and evolution of pathogenic Escherichia coli strains associated with animal and human infections continues being a topic of active investigation in recent years. Latin America has responded to this thread establishing the Latin American Coalition for Escherichia coli Research (LACER), a multidisciplinary group of scientists applying principles of the One Health initiative. LACER is integrating animal, human and environmental health for the mutual benefit of all, while reducing the impact of human disease. Here, I depict the usefulness of this approach by providing three examples from several priority areas in E. coli research and comparing them to the activities performed by LACER, which are enhancing collaborative efforts in biomedical research and providing a translational platform to connect with epidemiological studies and public health policy makers. The manuscript concludes with a brief historical description regarding the establishment of LACER, emphasizing the importance of collaboration between health professionals of different international organizations and not only across one specific country, to effectively combat current and future E. coli infections. The benefits of utilizing 'One Health' concepts in the establishment of LACER should encourage other professionals studying zoonotic or environmentally acquired human infections to implement effective international collaborations to combat common problems.
