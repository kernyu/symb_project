BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to establish the bacterial epidemiology of chronic osteoarticular infections in adults, to study the susceptibility of the isolated strains to antibiotics and to demonstrate the influence of osteosynthesis material thereon. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 78 months, from January 2006 to June 2012, providing bacteriological samples from patients with osteitis and osteoarthritis in the Mohammed V military teaching hospital of Rabat. Isolation and identification of bacteria were made by bacteriological classical techniques. The antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the isolates was performed by disk diffusion agar method, as recommended by the Committee of the susceptibility of the French Society for Microbiology (CA-SFM). RESULTS: We collected 234 cases, 53% (n = 124) of patients without osteosynthesis material (group A) and 47% (n = 110) patients with osteosynthesis material (group B).We isolated 371 bacteria which 51.49 (n = 191) in group A and 48.51% (n = 180) in group B. Gram-positive cocci were the most frequent (n = 234), followed by the Gram-negative bacilli (n = 114) and the Gram-positive bacilli (n = 19). Our study shows that the rate of resistance to antibiotics in strains obtained from patients with osteosynthesis material is higher compared to those obtained from patients without osteosynthesis material. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic OA infection in adults is difficult to diagnose and treat. Its good management must be multidisciplinary.
