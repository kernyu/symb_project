Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii is a major source of nosocomial infections worldwide and is mainly associated with the acquisition of OXA-type carbapenemases and, to a lesser extent, metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs). In this study, 82 nonepidemiologically related Acinetobacter strains carrying different types of OXA or MBL enzymes were tested using the Eazyplex system, a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)-based method to rapidly detect carbapenemase carriage. The presence/absence of carbapenem-hydrolyzing enzymes was correctly determined for all isolates in <30 min.
