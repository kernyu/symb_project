BACKGROUND: We sought to identify factors associated with Escherichia coli resistance to ciprofloxacin among discharged emergency department (ED) patient visits treated for a urinary tract infection (UTI). We hypothesized that specific historical factors available upon ED presentation would be associated with increased odds of ciprofloxacin resistance in this population. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, observational cohort study of consecutive discharged adult ED patient visits with a primary diagnosis of UTI caused by E coli to a single center from 2011 to 2014. Two investigators separately abstracted to a preconstructed data collection form the following independent variables on each included visit: patient age, sex, residence, active immunosuppressive condition or medication, chronic indwelling Foley catheter, hospitalization or antibiotic use within 90 days prior to presentation, and history of recurrent UTIs. We used multivariable logistic regression after taking into account colinearity to identify those independent variables associated with increased odds of ciprofloxacin resistance and report descriptive characteristics of the study cohort, odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and model strength. RESULTS: Age at least 65 years (OR, 3.15; 95% CI, 1.44-6.87; P=.004), recurrent UTI (OR, 6.23; 95% CI, 2.38-16.30; P<.001), and recent hospitalization (OR, 3.99; 95% CI, 1.56-10.23; P=.004) were significantly associated with ciprofloxacin-resistant E coli UTIs in relevant visits. CONCLUSION: In this single-center study, age at least 65 years, recurrent UTI, and recent hospitalization were most clearly associated with increased odds of ciprofloxacin-resistant UTIs in discharged adult ED patient visits. If validated, these factors should suggest that alternative antimicrobial agents should be considered in the treatment of this condition among discharged adult ED patients.
