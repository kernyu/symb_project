This study was designed to analyze results of daptomycin therapy in 7 patients with enterococcal infectious endocarditis caused by Enterococcus faecium in two of them. Mean duration of therapy was 36.7 days. 70% of the strains proved resistant to gentamycin, 40% showed resistance to penicillin antibiotics, and 14.3% to vancomycin. Three patients suffered prosthetic valve endocarditis, six had elevated presepsin level (up to 768.8 pg/ml). 28,6% of the patients underwent valve prosthetic surgery. Hospital lethality was 14,3%. The effectiveness of ampicillin plus ceftriaxone treatment of gentanycin-resistant enterococci is discussed. Recommendation for the antibacterial treatment of enterococcal infectious endocarditis (ESC 2015) are provided.
