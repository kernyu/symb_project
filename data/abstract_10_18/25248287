BACKGROUND: Prolonged asymptomatic carriage of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in the gastrointestinal tract and the lack of effective decolonization regimen perpetuate the endemicity of VRE in the healthcare settings. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a regimen for decolonization of gastrointestinal carriage of VRE by a combination of environmental disinfection, patient isolation, bowel preparation to wash-out the fecal bacterial population using polyethylene glycol, a five-day course of oral absorbable linezolid and non-absorbable daptomycin to suppress any remaining VRE, and subsequent oral Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG to maintain the colonization resistance in four patients, including two patients with end-stage liver cirrhosis, one patient with complication post liver transplant, and one patient with complicated infective endocarditis. All patients had clearance of VRE immediately after decolonization, and 3 of them remained VRE-free for 23 to 137 days of hospitalization, despite subsequent use of intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics without anti-VRE activity. CONCLUSION: This strategy should be further studied in settings of low VRE endemicity with limited isolation facilities.
