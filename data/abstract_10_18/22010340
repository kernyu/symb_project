OBJECTIVE: To investigate distribution and drug-susceptibility of bacteria in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. METHOD: The purulent discharges or mucous membrane lesions were collected from the sinus of 51 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis receiving sinus surgery. The clinical specimens were incubated and the drug susceptibility was analyzed. RESULT: Of 51 specimens, 41 (80.39%) showed positive results in bacteria culture. The antibiotic susceptibility was as follows: vancomycin-100%, moxifloxacin-100%, levofloxacin-92.31%, rifampin-90.91%, ciprofloxacin-81.58%, SMZ-TMP-67.65%, azithromycin-47.62%, clarithromycin-45.00%, ampicillin sodium and sulbactam sodium-35.90%, cefatriaxone-39.39%, cefuroxime sodium-30.43%, penicillin-8.33%. CONCLUSION: There are bacteria infections in most of chronic rhinosinusitis. The fluoroquinolones should be preferred in sinus surgery.
