BACKGROUND: We aimed to determine the virulence factor profile and phylogenetic grouping of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) causing urinary tract infection (UTI) in patients with and without diabetes mellitus (DM). METHODS: A total of 280 UPEC were collected from the urine samples of patients with DM (n=126) and patients suffering from non-DM UTIs (n=154). All isolates were subjected to phenotypic and genotypic virulence factor profile and phylogenetic grouping. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in phenotypic virulence factors of UPEC causing UTI from patients with and without DM; alpha-haemolysin (DM=52, 41.2%; non-DM=69, 44.8%), mannose resistant haemagglutination (DM=6, 36.2%; non-DM=64, 41.5%), biofilm production (DM=33.3%; non-DM=25.9%), serum resistance (DM=27, 21.4%; non-DM=46, 29.8%), cell surface hydrophobicity (DM=22, 17.1%; non-DM=18, 11.6%) and mannose sensitive hemagglutnation (DM=18, 14.2%; non-DM=29, 18.8%). Among the genotypic virulence markers, papC gene was most prevalent in both patients with DM (n=65, 51.6%) and without DM (n=88, 57.1%), followed by hlyD gene (DM=36, 28.6%; non-DM=52, 33.8%). Only cnf-1 gene was observed to be significantly associated (p<0.05) with the non-DM status (n=35, 22.7%) than DM (n=15, 11.9%). Irrespective of the diabetic status, majority of the UPEC isolates (approximately 50%) belonged to phylogenetic group B2 predominantly harboring the virulence genes papC, hlyD and cnf-1. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that there may not be a differential selection of virulence properties of UPEC causing UTI in patients with DM and in the general population.
