Azithromycin is an azalide, a subclass of macrolide antibiotics. It is derived from erythromycin, with a methyl-substituted nitrogen atom incorporated into the lactone ring, thus making the lactone ring 15-membered. It prevents bacteria from growing by interfering with their protein synthesis. It binds to the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome and thus inhibits translation of mRNA. Azithromycin is used to treat or prevent certain bacterial infections, most often those causing middle ear infections, strep throat, pneumonia, typhoid, bronchitis, and sinusitis. In recent years, it has been used primarily to prevent bacterial infections in infants and those with weaker immune systems. It is also effective against certain sexually transmitted infections, such as nongonococcal urethritis, chlamydia, and cervicitis. Recent studies have indicated it also to be effective against late-onset asthma, but these findings are controversial and not widely accepted. The present study gives a comprehensive profile of azithromycin, including detailed physico-chemical properties, nomenclature, formulae, methods of preparation, and methods of analysis (including compendial, electrochemical, spectroscopic, and chromatographic methods of analysis). Developed validated stability-indicating (HPLC and biodiffusion assay methods under accelerated acidic, alkaline, and oxidative conditions, in addition to effect of different types of light, temperature, and pH. Detailed clinical applications also presented (mechanism of action, ADME profile, clinical uses and doses, side effects, and drug interactions). Each of the above stages includes appropriate figures and tables. More than 80 references were given as a proof of the above-mentioned studies.
