One of the major complications of clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) is urinary tract infection (UTI). Recent reports showed that community-acquired UTIs caused by antimicrobial-resistant pathogens were gradually presenting in adults. However, there have been few reports about UTIs caused by antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in pediatric patients. Therefore, we retrospectively reviewed the medical charts of 45 children with CIC due to neurogenic bladder dysfunction from January 2010 to March 2013. Sixty-two episodes of cystitis occurred in 27 patients. Seventy bacterial strains were isolated from urine samples. The rate of Gram-negative bacteria was 84.3%. Six extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (E. coli) strains were isolated from 4 patients. An ESBL-producing Proteus mirabilis strain and a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain were isolated from one patient each. Most of the pathogens of cystitis in the pediatric patients with CIC were Gram-negative bacilli, especially E. coli. We should be aware that ESBL producing E. coli as potential pathogens cause cystitis and regularly survey antimicrobial susceptibility to understand the resistant strains that develop.
