Prevalence of the primary drug resistance mutations and resistance developed in patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapies in the HIV-infected persons in the Privolzhsky federal district was studied. It was demonstrated that among the ART-naive HIV-positive patients there were no mutations leading to the development of resistance. A high level of the resistance to lamivudin, nevirapin, efavirenz was revealed among the persons receiving the antiretroviral therapy. As a whole, the frequency of mutations of resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (23.8%) and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (26.9%) was much higher than to protease inhibitors (1.2%).
