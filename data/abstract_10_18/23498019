Escherichia coli isolated from bovine milk samples submitted to the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center Mastitis Laboratory (Wooster) in 1985 to 1987 and in 2009 were compared for antimicrobial susceptibility and prevalence of antimicrobial resistance genes. Forty-four isolates from 1985 to 1987 and 55 isolates from 2009 were tested. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of 15 antimicrobials were determined using a commercially available broth microdilution system. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction was performed for gene detection. The percentage of isolates susceptible to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, and kanamycin was lower in those collected in 1985 to 1987 than in isolates collected in 2009. Susceptibility did not differ between isolates from 1985 to 1987 and isolates from 2009 for the 12 other antimicrobials tested. A trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole resistance gene was detected more frequently in isolates from 1985 to 1987 than in isolates from 2009. Gene frequencies for streptomycin resistance and tetracycline resistance were similar among 1985 to 1987 isolates and 2009 isolates. Resistance to most antimicrobials did not differ between isolates submitted to a mastitis diagnostic laboratory in 1985 to 1987 and those submitted in 2009. Changes observed indicated an increase in frequency of susceptibility in isolates to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, and kanamycin in 2009 isolates compared with 1985 to 1987 isolates.
