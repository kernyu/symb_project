BACKGROUND: Mupirocin has been used topically for treating skin and skin structure infections and for nasal decolonization before surgical interventions. Pleuromutilin compounds, including retapamulin, provide similar treatment/interventional options. Rates of resistance of Staphylococcus aureus to mupirocin and other agents used to treat skin and skin structure infections vary between countries and medical centers, including those in the United States. These resistance rates may be associated with higher usage and/or improper epidemiologic practices. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine rates of resistance to topical and other class agents against S aureus isolates collected from SSSIs. METHODS: Isolates were obtained from outpatients at 6 US dermatology centers in 5 states. Demographic data were collected from medical records, and each patient completed a study questionnaire on recent history of skin infections, antibiotic use, and hospitalization. Each isolate was tested against cephalothin, clindamycin, erythromycin, gentamicin, mupirocin, tetracycline, retapamulin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. RESULTS: Although methicillin-resistance rates varied between centers (range, 15.8%-35.5%), macrolide resistance was ~50% at all of the sites in this study. Mupirocin-resistant isolates were observed much more frequently from 1 center (33.9%), and nearly all demonstrated high-level resistance. Only 1 retapamulin-resistant isolate (0.5%) was observed, with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 16 microg/mL. The other agents had relatively low resistance rates, which varied between centers and were dependent on susceptibility to methicillin. CONCLUSIONS: Although the rate of mupirocin-resistant S aureus isolates collected in this investigation was >10%, retapamulin resistance was infrequent. Surveillance of topical agents to determine resistance rates against targeted bacteria is necessary.
