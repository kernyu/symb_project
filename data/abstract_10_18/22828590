Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is an important cause of diarrhea in children. EPEC adheres to the intestinal epithelium and causes attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions. Recombinant Mycobacterium smegmatis (Smeg) and Mycobacterium bovis BCG strains were constructed to express either BfpA or intimin. The entire bfpA gene and a portion of the intimin gene were amplified by PCR from EPEC genomic DNA and inserted into the pMIP12 vector at the BamHI/KpnI sites. The pMIP_bfpA and pMIP_intimin vectors were introduced separately into Smeg and BCG. Recombinant clones were selected based on kanamycin resistance and designated rSmeg_pMIP_(bfpA or intimin) and rBCG_pMIP_(bfpA or intimin). The expression of bfpA and intimin was detected by Immunoblotting using polyclonal anti-BfpA and anti-intimin antibodies. The immunogenicity of these proteins was assessed in C57BL/6 mice by assaying the feces and serum for the presence of anti-BfpA and anti-intimin IgA and IgG antibodies. TNF-alpha and INF-gamma were produced in vitro by spleen cells from mice immunized with recombinant BfpA, whereas TNF-gamma was produced in mice immunized with recombinant intimin. The adhesion of EPEC (E2348/69) to HEp-2 target cells was blocked by IgA or IgG antibodies from mice immunized with recombinant BfpA or intimin but not by antibodies from non-immunized mice. Immunogenic non-infectious vectors containing relevant EPEC virulence genes may be promising vaccine candidates.
