The Abbott RealTime (ART) HIV-1 assay targets the integrase region and is designed to tolerate mismatches. Variability in integrase sequences comprising the assay target regions from >1000 clinical specimens submitted for phenotypic and genotypic raltegravir resistance testing were analyzed. In this large collection of sequences from clinical specimens, the number and location of raltegravir resistance associated mutations did not differ from those tested previously and shown not to result in under-estimation of viral loads.
