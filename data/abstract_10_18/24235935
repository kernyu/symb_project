BACKGROUND: Wound infections are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence, aetiology and susceptibility profile of bacterial agents of wound infection among in- and- out patients at a rural tertiary hospital in Nigeria, within a 5 year period. METHODS: Wound swabs collected from 156 out-patients and 353 in-patients were, cultured and microbial isolates identified using standard methods. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was done on bacterial isolates. RESULTS: The prevalence of wound infection in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 was 71.4%, 76.2%, 74.5%, 61.5%, and 67.0% respectively. The overall prevalence of wound infection was 70.1%. In all the years studied, out-patients had a higher prevalence of wound infection, but this was significant in 2007, 2009, and 2010 only. Staphylococcus aureus was the most prevalent pathogen in both in- and out - patients with the exception of 2009 where both Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa had the same prevalence (24.4%) among in - patients. The flouroquinolones were the most potent antimicrobial agents against bacterial isolates from both in - and out -patients. CONCLUSION: Staphylococcus aureus was the most predominant etiologic agent of wound infection among in and out patients. A generally higher resistance pattern was observed among nosocomial bacterial pathogens. Prudent use of antibiotics is recommended.
