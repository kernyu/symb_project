Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is a leading health problem. Compared to methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, MRSA infections are associated with greater morbidity and mortality, but the mechanisms underlying MRSA pathogenicity are unclear. Here we show that the protein conferring beta-lactam antibiotic resistance, penicillin-binding protein 2A (encoded by the mecA gene), directly contributes to pathogenicity during MRSA infection. MecA induction leads to a reduction in peptidoglycan cross-linking that allows for enhanced degradation and detection by phagocytes, resulting in robust IL-1beta production. Peptidoglycan isolated from beta-lactam-challenged MRSA strongly induces the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages, but these effects are lost upon peptidoglycan solubilization. Mutant MRSA bacteria with naturally occurring reduced peptidoglycan cross-links induce high IL-1beta levels in vitro and cause increased pathology in vivo. beta-lactam treatment of MRSA skin infection exacerbates immunopathology, which is IL-1 dependent. Thus, antibiotic-induced expression of mecA during MRSA skin infection contributes to immunopathology by altering peptidoglycan structure.
