BACKGROUND: Recently published data suggest that artemisinin derivatives and synthetic peroxides, such as the ozonides OZ277 and OZ439, have a similar mode of action. Here the cross-resistance of OZ277 and OZ439 and four additional next-generation ozonides was probed against the artemisinin-resistant clinical isolate Plasmodium falciparum Cam3.I, which carries the K13-propeller mutation R539T (Cam3.I(R539T)). METHODS: The previously described in vitro ring-stage survival assay (RSA0-3h) was employed and a simplified variation of the original protocol was developed. RESULTS: At the pharmacologically relevant concentration of 700 nM, all six ozonides were highly effective against the dihydroartemisinin-resistant P. falciparum Cam3.I(R539T) parasites, showing a per cent survival ranging from <0.01 to 1.83%. A simplified version of the original RSA0-3h method was developed and gave similar results, thus providing a practical drug discovery tool for further optimization of next-generation anti-malarial peroxides. CONCLUSION: The absence of in vitro cross-resistance against the artemisinin-resistant clinical isolate Cam3.I(R539T) suggests that ozonides could be effective against artemisinin-resistant P. falciparum. How this will translate to the human situation in clinical settings remains to be investigated.
