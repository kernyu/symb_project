The echinocandins are important agents for the treatment of invasive fungal infections, especially those caused by Candida species. However, as with other antimicrobial agents, microbiologic resistance to this class of antifungal agents has emerged and can result in clinical failure. Several studies have recently reported an increase in echinocandin resistance in Candida glabrata isolates at various medical centers in different geographic regions of the USA. Recent studies have also reported that many of these isolates may also be fluconazole resistant, leaving few treatment options available for clinicians to use in patients with invasive candidiasis caused by this species. Our understanding of the clinical relevance of specific point mutations within the FKS genes that cause echinocandin resistance and risk factors for the development of microbiologic resistance and clinical failure have also increased. The purpose of this review is to discuss echinocandin resistance in Candida species and recent reports that have increased our understanding of this growing clinical problem.
