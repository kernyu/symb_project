Tuberculosis (TB) continues to be a significant cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. An estimated 2 billion individuals are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and annually there are approximately 10 million new cases of clinical TB and 1.5 million deaths. Currently available drugs and vaccines have had no significant impact on TB control. In addition, the emergence of drug resistant TB is considered a public health crisis, with some strains now resistant to all available drugs. Unfortunately, the growing burden of antibiotic resistance is coupled with decreased effort in the development of new antibiotics. Natural sources are attractive starting points in the search for anti-tubercular drugs because they are extremely rich in chemical diversity and have privileged antimicrobial activity. This review will discuss recent advances in the development of TB drug leads from natural products, with a particular focus on anti-mycobacterial compounds in late-stage preclinical and clinical development.
