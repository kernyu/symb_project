A series of new artemisinin-derived hybrids which incorporate cholic acid moieties have been synthesized and evaluated for their antileukemic activity against sensitive CCRF-CEM and multidrug-resistant CEM/ADR5000 cells. The new hybrids 20-28 showed IC50 values in the range of 0.019microM-0.192microM against CCRF-CEM cells and between 0.345microM and 7.159microM against CEM/ADR5000 cells. Amide hybrid 25 proved the most active compound against both CCRF-CEM and CEM/ADR5000 cells with IC50 value of 0.019+/-0.001microM and 0.345+/-0.031microM, respectively. A relatively low cross resistance to hybrids 20-28 in the range of 5.7-fold to 46.1-fold was measured. CEM/ADR5000 cells showed higher resistance than CCRF-CEM to all the tested compounds. Interestingly, the lowest cross resistance to 23 was observed (5.7-fold), whereas hybrid 25 showed 18.2-fold cross-resistant to CEM/ADR5000 cells. Hybrid 25 which proved even more potent than clinically used doxorubicin against CEM/ADR5000 cells may serve as a promising antileukemic agent against both sensitive and multidrug-resistant cells.
