AIMS: This study aims to explore how feuD mutation triggered the increase in nisin immunity of Lactococcus lactis L58, which was proven to be a feuD::Em-Mu mutant of Lc. lactis N8. METHODS AND RESULTS: The significant difference genes of Lc. lactis L58 and Lc. lactis N8 were compared at transcription and protein levels. Analysis revealed that the feuD mutation induced decrease in histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein PtsH (HPr) and increase in thioredoxin reductase TrxB (TR). Determination of iron concentration and cytoplasmic membrane potential (MP) showed the iron concentration decreased around 10% and the MP decreased approx. 14% in Lc. lactis L58. CONCLUSIONS: The increase in nisin immunity was dominated by TR up-expression by two main mechanisms in Lc. lactis L58. First, the TR-TRX (thioredoxin reductase) system changed the composition of cytoplasmic membrane by regulating the lipid metabolism to enhance the cells' resistance to nisin. Second, iron starvation stress induced decrease in MP; hence, the binding affinity of nisin to lipid II of Lc. lactis L58 decreased, which, in turn, increased the nisin immunity. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The knowledge on regulation mechanism of nisin immunity was enriched, and the theoretical basis for improving nisin production in engineering strain could be provided.
