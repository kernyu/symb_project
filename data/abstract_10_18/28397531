Drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains are a major threat to the control of tuberculosis (TB), but the prevalence of drug-resistant TB is still unknown in the southern ethnic region of China. A cluster-randomized sampling method was used to include the study population. Isolates were tested for resistance to 6 antituberculosis drugs, and genotyped to identify Beijing strains. Overall, 11.3% (139/1229) of new cases and 33.0% (126/382) of retreated cases had drug-resistant tuberculosis. Multiple previous TB treatment episodes and multiple treatment interruptions were risk factors for both drug-resistant and multidrug-resistant TB among retreated cases. A total of 53.2% of the patients were infected with a Beijing strain of M tuberculosis. Infection with a Beijing strain was significantly associated with drug resistance among new cases (odds ratio, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.01-2.07). Novel strategies to rapid diagnosis and effective treatment are urgently needed to prevent the development of drug resistance.
