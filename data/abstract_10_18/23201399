Routine daily bathing of intensive care (ICU) patients with topical chlorhexidine reduces meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) acquisition. The aim of this study was to investigate whether repeated five-day cycles of daily topical octenidine could result in a similar effect. This was a two-year retrospective, uncontrolled study in a mixed medical and surgical ICU/high dependency unit, demonstrating a 76% reduction in MRSA acquisition but no significant reduction in all ICU-acquired bacteraemias. Chlorhexidine use is increasing but resistance is being reported. This pilot study found a similar reduction in MRSA acquisition with octenidine as an alternative to chlorhexidine. Further study is required to establish causality.
