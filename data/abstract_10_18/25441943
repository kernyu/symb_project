Seventy-four bacterial proven cases of urinary tract infections were studied, and identified by Mac Conkey agar and blood agar medium separately; all the isolates were subjected to antimicrobial sensitivity testing by Stokes technique. Ninty-six percent of total isolated organisms were found to be gram negative while remaining 4% were gram positive. Among gram negatives, E. coli and gram positive S. aureus were the most prevalent organisms. The percentage of gram negative isolates were as follows, E. coli (79.7%) followed by Klebsiella (9.5%), Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter were (2.7% each), Proteus constituted (1.4%). and among gram positive S. aureus (4%). The antibiotic resistance of identified organisms was carried out by disc-diffusion method with commercially available disc of thirteen antibiotics having different mode of actions such as inhibition of cell wall synthesis, membrane permeability alternatives, inhibition of protein synthesis and DNA synthesis inhibitors. Gram negatives showed more resistance to these antibiotics as compared to gram positive organisms. The most effective antibiotic for gram negative UTI isolates is amikacin showing 63% efficacy followed by Cefotaxime 55% efficacy, Amoxicillin and Ciprofloxacin with (49% each) efficacy. Among gram positives, Chloramphenicol, Co-trimoxazole, Gentamicin, Amikacin, Ciprofloxacin and Cefotaxime are most effective with (66.6% each) efficacy, then Ampicillin, Amoxicillin, Tetracycline and norfloxacin with (33.3% each) efficacy.
