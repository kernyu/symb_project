Three invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae strains nonsusceptible to linezolid were isolated in the United States between 2001 and 2012 from the CDC's Active Bacterial Core surveillance. Linezolid binds ribosomal proteins where structural changes within its target site may confer resistance. Our study identified mutations and deletions near the linezolid binding pocket of two of these strains within the rplD gene, which encodes ribosomal protein L4. Mutations in the 23S rRNA alleles or the rplV gene were not detected.
