CONTEXT: In today's medical scenario, the human race is battling the most intelligent enemy who has unending alternatives to combat with the potent elements they have produced against it. AIM: To study the resistance to linezolid among Staphylococcus aureus isolated from pus samples of orthopedic patients. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Pus samples were collected from dirty wounds of orthopedic patients undergoing long antimicrobial treatment programs. The sampling period was from July 2010 to June 2011. The samples were collected from different orthopedic hospitals of Nagpur (central India) representing a mixed sample of patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred pus samples were screened for S. aureus, by growth on mannitol salt agar (MSA), Baird-Parker agar (BPA), deoxyribonuclease test, tube coagulase test, and HiStaph latex agglutination test. Fifty-one S. aureus isolates were obtained which were further subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method (DDM). Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by an automated system, the VITEK 2 system. Also, Ezy MIC strip method was carried out in accordance with Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Twelve linezolid-resistant S. aureus (LRSA) isolates were recovered from 51 S. aureus cultures tested for susceptibility to linezolid using the DDM, VITEK 2 system, and Ezy MIC strip method. The emergence of resistance suggests nosocomial spread and abuse of antibiotic.
