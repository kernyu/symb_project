OBJECTIVE: To know the best empirical treatment of urethritis in patients at the City Center of Madrid. METHODS: 2.021 urethral exudates were analyzed in men between January 2003-December 2007. In addition to the traditional cultures, it was determined the presence of Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, Trichomonas vaginalis and Herpes simplex. The susceptibility of N.gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus spp was performed by disk diffusion method and U. urealyticum by Mycoplasma IST. RESULTS: The percentage of positive samples was: 30.6%. The most frequently isolated microorganisms were: U. urealyticum 9.9%, N. gonorrhoeae 7.4%, C. trachomatis 5.1% and Haemophilus spp 3.8%. The resistance of N. gonorrhoeae in the first period was: penicillin 11.8%, tetracycline 5.9%, ciprofloxacin 8.8% and presence of betalactamase 11.8%. In the second period: penicillin 9.7%, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 1.4%, tetracycline 8.3%, ciprofloxacin 23.6% and presence of betalactamase 10.5%. Resistance to ciprofloxacin in non-MSM (men having sex with men) was 20% and in MSM 56.2%. Resistance of Haemophilus spp in the first period was: 38.2% ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 8.8%, clarithromycin 35.3%, cotrimoxazole 64.7%, cefuroxime 5.9%, ciprofloxacin 8.8%, tetracycline 12.1% and presence of betalactamase 26.5%. In the second period:presence of betalactamase 41.9%, ampicillin 53.1%, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 9.4%, cefuroxime 9.4%, clarithromycin 18.7%, tetracycline 34.4%, ciprofloxacin 15.6%, and cotrimoxazole 68.7%. Resistance of U. urealyticum was: ciprofloxacin 80.7%, ofloxacin 32.4%, erythromycin 17.5%, azithromycin 9.6%, tetracycline 3.5% and doxycycline 0.8%. CONCLUSIONS: N. gonorrhoeae showed a level of resistance to tetracycline and ciprofloxacin higher in the second period, being significant for ciprofloxacin. Quinolone resistance was higher in MSM. Haemophilus spp showed a level of resistance to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin and tetracycline higher in the second period, being significant for tetracycline. U.urealyticum showed high level of resistance to ciprofloxacin (80.7%)and ofloxacin (32.4%) and low level of resistance to doxycycline (0.8%) and tetracycline (3.5%).
