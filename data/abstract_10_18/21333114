We performed drug susceptibility testing among chronic patients hospitalised in the tuberculosis (TB) referral centre of the capital of Djibouti. Among 36 patients tested, 27 had multidrug-resistant TB and four had extensively drug-resistant TB. National guidelines must be revised urgently and the administration of second-line TB medications strictly controlled.
