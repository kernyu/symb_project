BACKGROUND: Surgical antibiotic prophylaxis (SAP) is a critical area to optimize to reduce the escalation of antimicrobial resistance. This article explores the ways by which interpersonal relationships influence SAP decision making. METHODS: Twenty surgeons and anesthetists participated in in-depth semistructured interviews on SAP prescribing. Results were analyzed using the framework approach. RESULTS: Analysis revealed 3 ways by which interpersonal relationships influence SAP: relationship dynamics between the surgeon and the anesthetist determine appropriateness of SAP, particularly operative risk ownership; perceived hierarchies within, and between, surgical and anesthetist specialties influence antibiotic prescribing decisions; and surgical distance from the antimicrobial stewardship team, which influences use of antimicrobial stewardship principles. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions to optimize SAP are more likely to be effective in enacting sustained change if they consider the interpersonal and social contexts, including issues of familiarity and cohesiveness, hierarchical patterns, and sense of place within a team. Significant relational dynamics in SAP decision making are centered around risk; that is, personal/reputational risk to different professional groups and ownership of risk for individual patient outcomes. Risk must therefore be considered for sustainable SAP optimization interventions.
