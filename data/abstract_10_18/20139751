Recently, first-line lopinavir failure was observed due to protease mutation 76V. In the present study, we found 76V associated with protease mutation 46I and gag cleavage-site mutation 431V. Longitudinal analysis of patients failing protease inhibitor therapies demonstrated that 76V strictly occurs either together with 46I and/or 431V or in HIV isolates already harbouring one of both mutations. Therefore, all three mutations seem to cooperate in terms of protease inhibitor resistance.
