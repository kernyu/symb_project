Here we report the efficacy, safety and health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) associated with long-term lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Len + Dex) treatment in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) enrolled in the Spanish cohort of the MM-018 study. In this open-label, multicenter, single-arm expanded access study, 63 patients received Len + Dex until disease progression. The overall response rate was 78%, with 21% of the patients achieving a complete response. The quality of response improved with continuous treatment. The median duration of response was 18.4 months. Median time-to-progression and progression-free survival was 13.3 months for both; median overall survival was not reached. Len + Dex had a manageable safety profile consistent with previously reported phase III studies. HRQoL assessments (n = 42) at baseline and 6 months using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 and QLQ MY-20 questionnaires revealed that patients with RRMM treated with long-term lenalidomide reported clinically relevant improvements in certain QoL and symptoms scores regardless of treatment response (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00420849).
