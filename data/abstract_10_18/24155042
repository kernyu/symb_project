Selective modulation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) by direct binding of small molecules demonstrates a promising tool for treatment of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Besides its blood pressure-lowering properties, the AT1-receptor blocker telmisartan has been shown to be a partial agonist of PPARgamma with beneficial metabolic effects in vitro and in mice. In our previous work, comprehensive structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies discussed the different parts of the telmisartan structure and various moieties. Based on these findings, we designed and synthesized new PPARgamma ligands with a benzimidazole (agonists 4-5 and 4-6), benzothiophene (agonists 5-5 and 5-6) or benzofuran (agonists 6-5 and 6-6) moiety either at position 5 or 6 of the benzimidazole core structure. Lipophilicity and EC50 values were improved for all new compounds compared with telmisartan. Regarding PPARgamma activation, the compounds were characterized by a differentiation assay using 3T3-L1 cells and a luciferase assay with COS-7 cells transiently transfected with pGal4-hPPARgDEF, pGal5-TK-pGL3 and pRL-CMV. A decrease in both potency and efficacy was observed after the shift of either the benzothiophene or the benzofuran moiety from position 6 to position 5. Selective recruitment of the coactivators TRAP220, SRC-1 and PGC-1alpha, and release of corepressor NCoR1 determined by time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) was detected depending on residues in position 5 or 6.
