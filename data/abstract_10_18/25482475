Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) circulating recombinant form 08_BC (CRF08_BC), carrying the recombinant reverse transcriptase (RT) gene from subtypes B and C, has recently become highly prevalent in Southern China. As the number of patients increases, it is important to characterize the drug resistance mutations of CRF08_BC, especially against widely used antiretrovirals. In this study, clinically isolated virus (2007CNGX-HK), confirmed to be CRF08_BC with its sequence deposited in GenBank (KF312642), was propagated in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with increasing concentrations of nevirapine (NVP), efavirenz (EFV), or lamivudine (3TC). Three different resistance patterns led by initial mutations of Y181C, E138G, and Y188C were detected after the selection with NVP. Initial mutations, in combination with other previously reported substitutions (K20R, D67N, V90I, K101R/E, V106I/A, V108I, F116L, E138R, A139V, V189I, G190A, D218E, E203K, H221Y, F227L, N348I, and T369I) or novel mutations (V8I, S134N, C162Y, L228I, Y232H, E396G, and D404N), developed during NVP selection. EFV-associated variations contained two initial mutations (L100I and Y188C) and three other mutations (V106L, F116Y, and A139V). Phenotypic analyses showed that E138R, Y181C, and G190A contributed high-level resistance to NVP, while L100I and V106L significantly reduced virus susceptibility to EFV. Y188C was 20-fold less sensitive to both NVP and EFV. As expected, M184I alone, or with V90I or D67N, decreased 3TC susceptibility by over 1,000-fold. Although the mutation profile obtained in culture may be different from the patients, these results may still provide useful information to monitor and optimize the antiretroviral regimens.
