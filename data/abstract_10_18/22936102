A great number of fungal infections are related to biofilm formation on inert or biological surfaces, which are recalcitrant to most treatments and cause human mortality. Cryptococcus laurentii has been diagnosed as the aetiological pathogen able to cause human infections mainly in immunosuppressed patients and the spectrum of clinical manifestations ranges from skin lesions to fungaemia. The effect of temperature, pH and surface preconditioning on C. laurentii biofilm formation was determined by 2, 3-bis (2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5-[(phenylamino) carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium hydroxide (XTT) reduction assay. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analysis of C. laurentii biofilms demonstrated surface topographies of profuse growth and dense colonization with extensive polymeric substances around the cells. In this study, we determined the activity of amphotericin B, itraconazole and fluconazole against C. laurentii free-living cells and biofilms. The activity of antifungals tested was greater against free-living cells, but sessile cells fell into the resistant range for these antifungal agents. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), comprising the matrix of C. laurentii biofilms, were isolated by ultrasonication. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was performed with ethanol-precipitated and dried samples. Also, the multielement analysis of the EPS was performed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES).
