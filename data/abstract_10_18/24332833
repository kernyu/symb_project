OBJECTIVE: We retrospectively studied daptomycin use during 2010 at the Bichat-Claude-Bernard teaching-hospital (Paris) to observe the evolution of daptomycin prescriptions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients were included and several parameters were documented: site of infection, bacterial species involved, reason for daptomycin use, dose and clinical outcome. RESULTS: Ninety-five percent of daptomycin prescritions were off-label and most did not comply with local guidelines. Fifteen of the 21 patients were cured (71%), including 9 patients of the 12 with off-label and off-local recommendation prescriptions (75%). Osteitis and Enterococcus spp endocarditis were the new indications. Daptomycin was increasingly used at higher doses: 52% of our patients were given doses above 6mg/kg. Staphylococcus spp. was the most frequent pathogen responsible for infection is our patients, followed by Enterococcus spp. CONCLUSION: Daptomycin use is likely to evolve because of its effectiveness in the treatment of osteitis, left-sided and Enterococcus spp. infective endocarditis. It is generally used at higher doses, which are well tolerated. However, therapeutic monitoring needs to be developed. The antibiotic commission of our hospital gave new recommendations for daptomycin use in 2011.
