We created a panel of 10 representative multi-nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-resistant recombinant infectious molecular HIV-1 clones to assist researchers studying NNRTI resistance or developing novel NNRTIs. The cloned viruses contain most of the major NNRTI resistance mutations and most of the significantly associated mutation pairs that we identified in two network analyses. Each virus in the panel has intermediate- or high-level resistance to all or three of the four most commonly used NNRTIs.
