From 2001 to 2008, a total of 27 isolates of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium were obtained from 930 swine. All 27 isolates were resistant to streptomycin and tetracycline. Seventeen isolates were multidrug resistant to more than three antimicrobial agents. Seven of these multidrug-resistant isolates were pentaresistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, tetracycline, and nalidixic acid. Among 27 isolates, 14 isolates (51.8 %) were nalidixic acid resistant (MIC, >/=128 mug/ml) and had reduced susceptibility to various quinolones (MIC, 0.125 to 2 mug/ml). When quinolone resistance-determining regions in the gyrA and gyrB genes of these isolates were sequenced, 13 isolates had Asp87-->Tyr mutations and 1 isolate had Asp87-->Gly mutation in the quinolone resistance-determining region of gyrA, whereas no mutation was found in gyrB. Genes for qnrA, qnrB, and qnrS were not detected by PCR with specific primers. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of genomic DNA digested with Xba I showed two patterns suggesting a clonal spread of Salmonella Typhimurium in swine in Korea.
