OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of combination therapy of lamivudine (LAM) and adefovir dipivoxyl (ADV) for patients with hepatitis B-induced decompensated cirrhosis. METHODS: A total of 81 patients were randomly divided into a combination group and an ADV group over 48 week treatment course. The combination group were treated with LAM (100 mg/d) plus ADV (10 mg/d), and the ADV group with ADV (10 mg/d ) for 48 weeks. All patients received hepatic function support and symptomatic treatment. The levels of HBV DNA, liver function, Child-Pugh scores and HBV DNA indicators were observed before and after the treatment. RESULTS: At week 4, the mean reduction of HBV DNA was 1.83 lgIU/mL, 17.9% of the patients achieved undetectable HBV DNA and 28.2% showed normal ALT in the combination group. The counterpart in the ADV group was 0.96 lgIU/mL, 5.3% and 10.5%. At week 4, 12, 24 and 48, the differences in the mean reduction of HBV DNA, undetectable HBV DNA and ALT normalization were statistically significant between the 2 groups. The difference in HBeAg negative conversion rates and HBeAg seroconversion at week 24 and 48 was not significant. CONCLUSION: The combination therapy results in HBV suppression and improved liver function and Child-Pugh score. The combination treatment has an advantage over ADV due to low drug resistance rate and good tolerance.
