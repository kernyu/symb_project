We reported a woman with urinary-tract infection caused by OXA-48 producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. Using molecular techniques, we showed that she might acquire this bacterium from another family member who lived in the same house. The two isolates, although different by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing, carried blaOXA-48 in a similar IncL/M plasmid. This case report shows that community spreading of carbapenemase producing Enterobacteriaceae occurs in the low endemic area not only in nosocomial setting but also in the community.
