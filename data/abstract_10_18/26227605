The complete genome sequence for the reference strain Acinetobacter baumannii CIP 70.10 (ATCC 15151) was established. The strain was isolated in France in 1970, is susceptible to most antimicrobial compounds, and is therefore of importance for comparative genome analyses with clinical multidrug-resistant (MDR) A. baumannii strains to study resistance development and acquisition in this emerging human pathogen.
