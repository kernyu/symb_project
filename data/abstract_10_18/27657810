Antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections have seen a marked increase in recent years, while antibiotic discovery has waned. Resistance-modifying agents (RMA) offer an intriguing alternative strategy to fight against resistant bacteria. Here we report the discovery, antibiotic profiling, and structure-activity relationships of a novel class of RMAs, tetracyclic indolines. These selectively potentiate beta-lactam antibiotics in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) without antibacterial or beta-lactamase inhibitory activity on their own. The most potent analogue, 6a, showed strong potentiation of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in a variety of hospital-acquired and community-acquired MRSA strains with low mammalian toxicity. These compounds may be further developed to extend the clinic life span of beta-lactam antibiotics.
