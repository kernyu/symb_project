Doxycycline hyclate (DOX-h) attenuates inflammatory conditions independent of its antimicrobial effect. This study aimed to observe the effects of DOX-h on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction. The endothelial monolayer permeability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was monitored by transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER). The phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and the arrangement of F-actin were detected. The results showed that both pretreatment and simultaneous treatment with DOX-h markedly attenuated the LPS-induced reduction in TEER and the disorganization of F-actin on HUVECs in a dose- and time-dependent manner. LPS mediated the phosphorylation of all three MAPKs (p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)), but DOX-h was only able to inhibit the LPS-induced phosphorylation of p38 and JNK. The data further suggested that DOX-h alleviated LPS-evoked TEER reduction and F-actin redistribution by inhibiting the phosphorylation of p38 and its downstream target, heat shock protein (HSP)27. Thus, DOX-h attenuates LPS-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction via inhibition of the p38 MAPK-HSP27-F-actin pathway.
