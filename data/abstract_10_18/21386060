Although elevation of the blood glucose level is a causal adverse effect of treatment with interferon (IFN), the precise underlying molecular mechanism is largely unknown. We examined the effects of type I and type II IFN (IFN-beta and IFN-gamma) on insulin-induced metabolic signaling leading to glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. IFN-beta suppressed insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 without affecting its expression, whereas IFN-gamma reduced both the protein level and tyrosine phosphorylation. Although both IFNs stimulated phosphorylation of STAT1 (at Tyr(701)) and STAT3 (at Tyr(705)) after treatment for 30 min, subsequent properties of induction of the SOCS isoform were different. IFN-beta preferentially induced SOCS1 rather than SOCS3, whereas IFN-gamma strongly induced SOCS3 expression alone. In addition, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of either SOCS1 or SOCS3 inhibited insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, whereas the reduction of IRS-1 protein was observed only in SOCS3-expressed cells. Notably, IFN-beta-induced SOCS1 expression and suppression of insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 were attenuated by siRNA-mediated knockdown of STAT1. In contrast, adenovirus-mediated expression of a dominant-negative STAT3 (F-STAT3) attenuated IFN-gamma-induced SOCS3 expression, reduction of IRS-1 protein, and suppression of insulin-induced glucose uptake but did not have any effect on the IFN-beta-mediated SOCS1 expression and inhibition of insulin-induced glucose uptake. Interestingly, pretreatment of IFN-gamma with IL-6 synergistically suppressed insulin signaling, even when IL-6 alone had no significant effect. These results indicate that type I and type II IFN induce insulin resistance by inducing distinct SOCS isoforms, and IL-6 synergistically augments IFN-gamma-induced insulin resistance by potentiating STAT3-mediated SOCS3 induction in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.
