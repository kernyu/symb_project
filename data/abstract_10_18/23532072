Pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-trigged immunity (PTI) is the first defensive line of plant innate immunity and is mediated by pattern recognition receptors. Here, we show that a mutation in BR-SIGNALING KINASE1 (BSK1), a substrate of the brassinosteroid (BR) receptor BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1, suppressed the powdery mildew resistance caused by a mutation in ENHANCED DISEASE RESISTANCE2, which negatively regulates powdery mildew resistance and programmed cell death, in Arabidopsis thaliana. A loss-of-function bsk1 mutant displayed enhanced susceptibility to virulent and avirulent pathogens, including Golovinomyces cichoracearum, Pseudomonas syringae, and Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis. The bsk1 mutant also accumulated lower levels of salicylic acid upon infection with G. cichoracearum and P. syringae. BSK1 belongs to a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase family and displays kinase activity in vitro; this kinase activity is required for its function. BSK1 physically associates with the PAMP receptor FLAGELLIN SENSING2 and is required for a subset of flg22-induced responses, including the reactive oxygen burst, but not for mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Our data demonstrate that BSK1 is involved in positive regulation of PTI. Together with previous findings, our work indicates that BSK1 represents a key component directly involved in both BR signaling and plant immunity.
