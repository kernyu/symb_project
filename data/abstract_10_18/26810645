Linezolid (LZD) has become increasingly important for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), but its mechanisms of resistance are not well characterized. We isolated 32 mutants ofMycobacterium tuberculosiswith reduced susceptibility to LZD, which was accounted for byrrlandrplCmutations in almost equal proportions, causing lower and higher MICs, respectively. Our findings provide useful information for the rapid detection of LZD resistance for improved treatment of MDR-TB.
