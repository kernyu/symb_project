The limited therapeutic options against the influenza virus (flu) and increasing challenges in drug resistance make the search for next-generation agents imperative. In this context, heterotrimeric viral PA/PB1/PB2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is an attractive target for a challenging but strategic protein-protein interaction (PPI) inhibition approach. Since 2012, the inhibition of the polymerase PA-PB1 subunit interface has become an active field of research following the publication of PA-PB1 crystal structures. In this Perspective, we briefly discuss the validity of flu polymerase as a drug target and its inhibition through a PPI inhibition strategy, including a comprehensive analysis of available PA-PB1 structures. An overview of all of the reported PA-PB1 complex formation inhibitors is provided, and approaches used for identification of the inhibitors, the hit-to-lead studies, and the emerged structure-activity relationship are described. In addition to highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of all of the PA-PB1 heterodimerization inhibitors, we analyze their hypothesized binding modes and alignment with a pharmacophore model that we have developed.
