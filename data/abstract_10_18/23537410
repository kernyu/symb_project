Among the 35 new molecular entities approved by the FDA in 2011, 17 were particularly notable for their significant contributions to the health of patients, including abiraterone acetate, vandetanib, belatacept and fidaxomicin. Thus, abiraterone acetate, namely Zytiga(R), was included as the first in a new class of drugs to treat late-stage prostate cancer. The ability of Zytiga(R) to prolong survival in these patients was considered as significant because they have few other treatments options and the benefits of Zytiga(R) outweighed the risks of reported side-effects. Vandetanib, namely Caprelsa(R), was also considered as a relevant drug since it represents the first drug approved to treat particularly aggressive medullary thyroid cancer, an orphan disease. Despite huge progress in transplantation, renal transplantation remains a serious problem since patients treated with the calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine and tacrolimus are at high risk of developing renal injury. With longer follow-up, the novel immunosuppressant belatacept continued to show better renal function compared with a cyclosporine-based regimen, as well as a consistent safety profile and comparable efficacy. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in June 2011 for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in adult recipients of a kidney transplant acting by a selective T-cell costimulation blocker given as an infusion. Clostridium difficile is currently the most important cause of infectious diarrhea in the United States. Fidaxomicin, a macrolide antibiotic, was recently approved for treatment of these infections (CDIs). It could be an alternative treatment for infection with C. difficile, with similar efficacy and safety to vancomycin. Fidaxomicin has minimal activity against Bacteroides species, which may be advantageous in maintaining colonization resistance and protecting the gastrointestinal tract from colonization by C. difficile.
