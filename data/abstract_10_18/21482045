Nasal swabs were collected at three time points from 2378 calves in four feedlots and cultured for Histophilus somni to assess genetic relatedness and tetracycline resistance. The proportions of animals carrying tetracycline resistant isolates were 0.32% at arrival, 14.82% at interim, and 0.80% at exit. The 606 H. somni isolates recovered were compared by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), screened for the presence of plasmids, and assessed for the tetracycline resistance genes tet(A), tet(B), tet(C), tet(E), tet(G), tet(H), tet(K), tet(L), tet(M) and tet(O) using multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Most of the isolates (98.6%) belonged to one of seven PFGE clusters (A-G) of closely related profiles with 77.7% of the isolates belonging to clusters C and D. Clusters A, B and E were associated with a higher proportion of tetracycline susceptible isolates. Genetic diversity of the isolates was highest at entry in the feedlot and lowest after the period when the animals received in-feed chlortetracycline (interim samples). Clusters A and E were more prominently represented at exit from the feedlot than other clusters. All resistant strains harboured the gene tet(H) while no other tetracycline resistance genes and no plasmids were detected with the methodology employed. It appears that genetic variability in H. somni in Alberta feedlots is low, dissemination likely occurs by clonal expansion, and resistance to tetracyclines is mediated by the tet(H) encoded efflux pump. Pulsotypes associated with tetracycline susceptible strains appear more common at exit suggesting that the in-feed oxytetracycline included throughout the feeding period is not sufficient to exert selective pressure for resistant strains.
