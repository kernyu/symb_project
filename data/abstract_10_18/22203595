The antiviral profile of BMS-790052, a potent hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication complex inhibitor targeting nonstructural protein NS5A, is well characterized for HCV genotype-1. Here, we report that BMS-790052 inhibits hybrid replicons containing HCV genotype-4 NS5A genes with 50% effective concentrations (EC(50)s) ranging from 7 to 13 pM. NS5A residue 30 was an important site for BMS-790052-selected resistance in the hybrid replicons. Our results support the potential of BMS-790052 as a valuable component of combination therapy for HCV genotype-4 chronic infection.
