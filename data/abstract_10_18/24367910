The presence of replication-competent lentivirus (RCL) in lentiviral vector preparations is a major safety concern for clinical applications of such vectors. RCL are believed to emerge from rare recombinant vector genomes that are referred to as partial recombinants or Psi-Gag recombinants. To quantitatively determine the fraction of partial recombinants in lentiviral vector preparations and to analyze them at the DNA sequence level, we established a drug selection assay involving a lentiviral packaging construct containing a drug-resistance gene encoding blasticidin (BSD) resistance. Upon transduction of target cells, the BSD resistance gene confers BSD resistance to the transduced cells. The results obtained indicate that there were up to 156 BSD-resistant colonies in a total of 10(6) transducing vector particles. The predicted recombination events were verified by polymerase chain reaction using genomic DNA obtained from BSD-resistant cell clones and by DNA sequence analysis. In an attempt to reduce the emergence of partial recombinants, sequence overlaps between the packaging and the vector constructs were reduced by substituting the Rev response element (RRE) present in the vector construct using a heterologous RRE element derived from simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac239). The results obtained showed that a reduction of sequence overlaps resulted in an up to sevenfold reduction of the frequency of BSD-resistant colonies, indicating that the capacity to form partial recombinants was diminished.
