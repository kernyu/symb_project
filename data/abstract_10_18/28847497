BACKGROUND: There has been a dramatic increase in the number of hospital-acquired infections, which is linked to the pandemic of multidrug resistance. Clinical environments provide an ideal reservoir for the growth, proliferation, and transmission of pathogenic organisms, including bacterial and yeast species. Consequently, the need for improved, effective disinfectants is of paramount importance. METHODS: Studies were conducted to assess the efficacy of chemical disinfectants-peracetic acid and triameen-on microbial strains. Testing included the assessment of antimicrobial and antisporicidal activity of disinfection solutions performed on a range of clinical isolates that pose a high risk for patient morbidity in clinical settings. RESULTS: Both chemical disinfectants successfully inactivated all test strains, with peracetic acid showing a greater level of antimicrobial activity. Escherichia coli proved most susceptible when assessed by the Kirby disk diffusion, suspension, and medical suspension assays with the greatest reduction in cell viability achieved. Antibiotic-resistant Enterococcus and Staphylococcus aureus strains showed greatest resistance to both disinfectants. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Test chemicals show potential to act as intermediate-level disinfectants inactivating vegetative microorganisms and bacterial spores on clinically relevant strains where they show potential as a preventative measure in relation to nosocomial infections.
