The Etest glycopeptide resistance detection identified two potential heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (hVISA) isolates from a screen of 288 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates from patients at a Connecticut Veterans Hospital. However, the two isolates did not meet the criteria for hVISA by the population analysis profile-area under the curve analysis, arguing against routine screening for hVISA in this low prevalence population.
