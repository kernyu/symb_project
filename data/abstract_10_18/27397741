Chryseobacterium indologenes is a widespread bacteria in the environment, especially hospitals, and a rarely reported human pathogen. The lowest frequency has been reported in children under 5 years of age. Clinical manifestations of C. indologenes include nosocomial pneumoniae, biliary tract infection, peritonitis, surgical wound infection, intravascular catheter-related bacteremia, cellulitis, and primary bacteremia. There is a knowledge gap in the management of C. indologenes infections, especially pertaining children, because of multiple antibiotic resistance and limited data in the literature concerning effective empirical treatment. In the published literature, a total of 16 cases of C. indologenes infections were reported in the pediatric age group. Herein, we present our experience in 6 children with C. indologenes infections. Early and prompt management of C. indologenes infections, particularly in children with mechanic ventilation, with polymicrobial infections, and under the age of 2 years, is of major importance because these factors seem to have a negative effect on the prognosis of infections caused by C. indologenes. Ciprofloxacin and TPM-SMX may be the best therapeutic choices for a combined initial empirical treatment of the patients.
