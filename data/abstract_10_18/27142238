Candida albicans infections and their resistance to clinically approved azole drugs are major concerns for human. The azole antifungal drugs inhibit the ergosterol synthesis by targeting lanosterol 14alpha-demethylase of cytochrome P450 family. The lack of high-resolution structural information of fungal pathogens has been a barrier for the design of modified azole drugs. Thus, a preliminary theoretical molecular dynamic study is carried out to develop and validate a simple homologous model using crystallographic structure of the lanosterol 14alpha-demethylase of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (PDB ID-1EA1) in which the active site residues are substituted with that of C. albicans (taxid 5476). Further, novel designed pyrazole analogs (SGS1-16) docked on chimeric 1EA1 and revealed that SGS-16 show good binding affinity through non-bonding interaction with the heme, which is different from the leading azole antifungals. The ADME-T results showed these analogs can be further explored in design of more safe and effective antifungal agents.
