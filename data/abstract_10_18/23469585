INTRODUCTION: Gonorrhea is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections (STls) in developing countries, and the emergence of resistance to antimicrobial agents in Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a major obstacle in the control of gonorrhoea. Periodical determination of the prevalence and monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibility of N. gonorrhoeae is essential for the early detection of emergence of drug resistance. METHODS: A total of 640 consecutive patients who attended the Outpatient Department (OPD) Clinics at St. Mary's Hospital Lacor between Jan 2007-Dec 2011, with gonococcal urethriris symptoms and whose urethral swabs and high vagina swabs (HVS) were cultured, were involved in the study. Two hundred and fifty six (256) patients had positive pus swab culture, of which 151 (23.6%) showed growth of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. All the isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using the Kirby Bauer-disc diffusion techniques. RESULTS: Gonococcal isolates showed rapid decrease in susceptibility to the antimicrobials especially to ampicillin, tetracycline and erythomycin, ciprofloxacin, and intermediate to chloramphenicol, however, gentamicin and cefotaxime have remained as a single dose sensitive treatment for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Sensitization on drug use and adopting preventive measures and continuous education on safer sexual behavior through health care authorities would lead to reduction in the prevalence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and resistance to antimicrobial. DISCUSSION: Gonorrhea is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in developing countries, and the emergence of resistance to antimicrobial agents in Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a major obstacle in the control of gonorrhea. Periodical monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibility of N. gonorrhea is essential for the early detection of emergence of drug resistance.
