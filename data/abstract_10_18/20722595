The changing pattern of resistance to antibacterial agents was a major theme at the 20th European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases. This article highlights presentations on the increasing threat from multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens, particularly extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, which are limiting the choice of drug therapy for serious infections. Surveillance data suggest that carbapenem antibiotics are appropriate choices for the empiric treatment of intra-abdominal infection.
