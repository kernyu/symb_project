Arginine auxotrophy constitutes the Achilles' heel for several tumors, among them glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Hence, arginine-depleting enzymes such as arginine deiminase (ADI) from Streptococcus pyogenes are promising for treatment of primary and maybe even refractory GBM. Based on our previous study in which ADI-susceptibility was shown on a panel of patient-derived GBM cell lines, we here aimed at deciphering underlying molecular mechanisms of ADI-mediated growth inhibition. We found that ADI (35 mU/mL) initially induces a cellular stress-response that is characterized by upregulation of genes primarily belonging to the heat-shock protein family. In addition to autophagocytosis, we show for the first time that senescence constitutes another cellular response mechanism upon ADI-treatment and that this bacterial enzyme is able to act as radiosensitizer ((1/4) cases). Long-term treatment schedules revealed no resistance development, with treated cells showing morphological signs of cell stress. Next, several combination strategies were employed to optimize ADI-based treatment. Simultaneous and sequential S. pyogenes ADI-based combinations included substances acting at different molecular pathways (curcumin, resveratrol, quinacrine, and sorafenib, 2 x 72 h treatment). Adding drugs to GBM cell lines (n = 4, including a matched pair of primary and recurrent GBM in one case) accelerated and potentiated ADI-mediated cytotoxicity. Autophagy was identified as the main cause of tumor growth inhibition. Of note, residual cells again showed classical signs of senescence in most combinations. Our results suggest an alternative treatment regimen for this fatal cancer type which circumvents many of the traditional barriers. Using the metabolic defect in GBM thus warrants further (pre-) clinical evaluation.
