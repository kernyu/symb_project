Recent reports demonstrate that failure of artemisinin-based antimalarial therapies is associated with an altered response of early blood stage Plasmodium falciparum. This has led to increased interest in the use of pulse assays that mimic clinical drug exposure for analysing artemisinin sensitivity of highly synchronised ring stage parasites. We report a methodology for the reliable execution of drug pulse assays and detail a synchronisation strategy that produces well-defined tightly synchronised ring stage cultures in a convenient time-frame.
