This study was conducted to investigate the molecular epidemiology of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli in community-acquired (urinary tract) infections (CA-UTI) in Tunisia. Between January 2007 and December 2009, 15 E. coli isolates were collected at the laboratory of microbiology of Charles Nicolle Hospital of Tunis. Microbial identification was done with conventional methods. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by disk diffusion method and ESBL detection was done with double-disk synergy test. ESBL typing was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. Phylogenetic groups, virulence factors, and sequence type (ST)131 were determined by PCR. Genetic relatedness between strains was examined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) after restriction with XbaI. The prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli in CA-UTI was 0.046%. The majority of isolates were multidrug resistant. ESBL types were CTX-M-15 (n=13) and SHV-12 (n=2). The most common phylogenetic group was B2 (n=11) and virulence score was greater than or equal to 9 in nine strains. PFGE revealed 12 clusters. The majority of isolates (n=14) belonged to ST131 clone and 11 of them were CTX-M producers. In conclusion, this is the first detailed documentation of CA-ESBLs producing E. coli in Tunisia. Of particular concern is the emergence in our community of the highly diffusing CTX-M-15-B2-ST131 E. coli clone, which requires strengthening surveillance measures to countervail this emergent public health problem.
