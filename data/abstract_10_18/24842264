The NPR1 gene was an important regulator for a plant disease resistance. The cDNA of NPR1 gene was cloned from peanut cultivar Ri Hua 1 by rapid amplification of cDNA ends-polymerase chain reaction (RACE-PCR). The full length cDNA of Arachis hypogaea NPR1 consisted of 2,078 base pairs with a 1,446 bp open-reading frame encoding 481 amino acids. The predicted NPR1 contained the highly conserved functional domains (BTB/POZ domain from M1 to D116), protein-protein interaction domains (three ankyrin repeats from K158 to L186; N187 to L217 and R221 to D250) and one NPR1-like domain (C262 to S469). The DNA sequence of the NPR1 gene was 2,332 or 2,223 bp. Both two sequences contained three introns and four exons. The NPR1 transcripts were expressed mainly in roots and leaves, while fewer signals were detected in the stems. Amount of the NPR1 transcript was significantly increased 1 h after salicylic acid challenge and was eventually 5.3 times greater than that in the control group. Both the DNA sequence and the coding sequence were obtained from eight cultivars and nine wild species of Arachis. Maximum likelihood analyses of d N/d S ratios for 25 sequences from different species showed that different selection pressures may have acted on different branches.
