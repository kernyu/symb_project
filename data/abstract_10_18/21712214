The practice of antimicrobial stewardship can be defined as optimizing clinical outcomes while minimizing the consequences of antimicrobial therapy such as resistance and superinfection. Antimicrobial stewardship can be difficult to transition to the emergency department (ED) since the traditional activities include the evaluation of broad-spectrum antimicrobial regimens at 72 and 96 hours and intravenous to oral medication conversion. The emergency medicine clinical pharmacist (EPh) has the knowledge and clinical assessment skills to manage an antimicrobial stewardship program focused on culture follow-up for patients discharged from the ED. This paper summarizes the experiences of developing an EPh-managed antimicrobial stewardship and culture follow-up program in the ED from 2 separate institutions. Specifically, the focus is on the steps for establishing an EPh-managed antimicrobial stewardship program, a description of the culture follow-up process, managing the culture data and cultures that require emergent notification and review, medical/legal concerns, and barriers to implementation. Outcomes data available from institutions with similar ED based antimicrobial stewardship programs are also discussed.
