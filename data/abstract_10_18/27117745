The objective of this study was to develop a bimetallic nanoparticle with enhanced antibacterial activity that would improve the therapeutic efficacy against bacterial biofilms. Bimetallic gold-silver nanoparticles were bacteriogenically synthesized using gamma-proteobacterium, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. The antibacterial activities of gold-silver nanoparticles were assessed on the planktonic and biofilm phases of individual and mixed multi-cultures of pathogenic Gram negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram positive bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus), respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentration of gold-silver nanoparticles was 30-50 microM than that of other nanoparticles (>100 microM) for the tested bacteria. Interestingly, gold-silver nanoparticles were more effective in inhibiting bacterial biofilm formation at 10 microM concentration. Both scanning and transmission electron microscopy results further accounted the impact of gold-silver nanoparticles on biocompatibility and bactericidal effect that the small size and bio-organic materials covering on gold-silver nanoparticles improves the internalization and thus caused bacterial inactivation. Thus, bacteriogenically synthesized gold-silver nanoparticles appear to be a promising nanoantibiotic for overcoming the bacterial resistance in the established bacterial biofilms.
