Salmonella carriage is an insidious problem for the poultry industry. While most Salmonella serotypes are avirulent in poultry, these bacteria can contaminate chicken meat during processing, leading to one of the most important food safety hazards. In this study, we examined the anti-Salmonella effects of Diamond V Original XPC() (XPC) included in the finisher diet fed to commercial broilers. On 3 occasions between day one (D1) and D20, broilers were experimentally infected with multiple antibiotic-resistant Salmonella Typhimurium. After confirming that the chicks were shedding Salmonella in the feces on D21, broiler chicks were fed a diet containing XPC (n = 57 birds; 1.25 kg/MT) or an XPC-free control diet (CON) (n = 57 birds) to D49. Fecal samples were obtained weekly and subjected to selective culture for enumerating and determining the antibiotic resistance of the Salmonella Salmonella isolates were then subjected to an in vitro virulence assay, which predicts the ability of Salmonella to cause illness in a mammalian host. Broilers were euthanized on D49 and a segment of the large intestine was removed and subjected to the same assays used for the fecal samples. When compared to the birds fed the CON diet, Salmonella fecal shedding, virulence (invasion and invasion gene expression), and antibiotic resistance were significantly decreased in birds fed XPC (5-fold, 7.5-fold, 6-fold, and 5.3-fold decreases, respectively). Birds fed XPC exhibited heavier body weight (BW) and greater BW gains than those fed the CON diet. The decrease in virulence was associated with a decreased expression of a genetic regulator of Salmonella invasion into cells (hilA), while the decrease in antibiotic resistance was due to a loss of an integron (SGI1) from the input strain. This study revealed that Original XPC() inhibits the shedding, downstream virulence, and antibiotic resistance of Salmonella residing in broilers.
