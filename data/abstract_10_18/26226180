Drug resistance has become a major concern in the field of infection management, therefore searching for new antibacterial agents is getting more challenging. Our study presents an optimized and eco-friendly synthesis scheme for a panel of nitroalkenes bearing various functional groups in the aromatic moiety and bromine or cyano substituents in 1 position of nitrovinyl moiety. The presence of nitrolefine group outside the ring minimalizes genotoxic properties while conjugation of aryl group with nitrovinyl moiety increases stability of the compounds. Then our research focused on evaluation of biological properties of such obtained (E)-2-aryl-1-cyano-1-nitroethenes. As they exhibit strong bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities against reference bacteria and yeast species with no detectable cytotoxicity towards cultured human HepG2 and HaCaT cells, they could be promising candidates for the replacement of traditional nitrofurane-containing antibacterial drugs. Nevertheless, validation of the obtained data in an in vivo model and additional safety studies on mutagenicity are still required.
