To assess the efficacy and safety of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in patients with localized scleroderma (LoS) resistant or intolerant to previous treatment with methotrexate (MTX). A case series of patients with LoS treated with MMF. Outcome was assessed through clinical examination. Adverse events were documented. Seven patients with LoS were treated with MMF. Median age at MMF initiation was 15 years (range 7-74 years). Three patients received MMF due to MTX ineffectiveness and 4 due to MTX intolerance. Disease remission was achieved in 4 patients and maintained in one patient. One patient showed a favourable response, but had to discontinue treatment due to elevated liver enzymes. The remaining patient experienced disease progression. MMF was shown to improve the clinical condition of patients with refractory LoS and may be a relatively safe alternative in patients who are intolerant to MTX.
