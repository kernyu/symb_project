Dual layer polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), antibacterial, hollow fiber, ultra-filtration composite membranes with antibacterial particles (silver (Ag) nano-particles loaded zeolite (Z-Ag)) in the outer layer were prepared with high water flux and desired pore sizes. The amounts of Ag(+) released from the composite membranes, freshly made and stored in water and salt solution, were measured. The result indicated that dual layer PVDF antibacterial hollow fiber containing Z-Ag (M-1-Ag) still possessed the ability of continuous release of Ag(+) even after exposure to water with high ionic content, showing a longer term resistance to bacterial adhesion and antibacterial activity than membrane doped with Z-Ag(+) (M-1). Results from an anti-adhesion and bacteria killing test with Escherichia coli supported that the antibacterial efficiency of dual hollow fiber PVDF membranes with Z-Ag was much higher than those with Z-Ag(+) after long time storage in water or exposure to phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution. This novel hollow fiber membrane may find applications in constructing sea water pretreatment devices with long term antifouling capability for the desalination processes.
