OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the antiviral efficacy of adefovir (ADV) rescue therapy and the feasibility of lamivudine (LAM) discontinuation in LAM-resistant chronic hepatitis B (CH-B) patients who had attained a virological response (VR) with LAM + ADV combination therapy. METHODS: The VR and virological breakthrough (VBT) were analyzed in 106 consecutively enrolled LAM-resistant CH-B patients who received ADV rescue therapy during a mean follow-up period of 55.2 months. Seventy-four patients achieved VR, and were divided into the LAM-discontinuation group (n = 39) and the LAM-continuation group (n = 35). The VR and VBT between the 2 groups were compared. RESULTS: For all 106 LAM-resistant CH-B patients, the overall cumulative probabilities of VR at 1, 2, 3 and 5 years of ADV rescue therapy were 40.6, 55.7, 64.6 and 81.3%, respectively. The cumulative probabilities of VBT at 1, 2, 3 and 5 years were 0, 2.9, 8.8 and 13.9%, respectively. Whether they discontinued or continued LAM after achieving VR on LAM + ADV therapy, VR and VBT were not significantly different during a mean follow-up period of 40.4 months. CONCLUSIONS: There was a good long-term VR with ADV rescue therapy for LAM-resistant CH-B patients. Moreover, discontinuing LAM was found to be feasible for patients who attained VR during ADV + LAM therapy.
