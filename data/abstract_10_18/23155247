BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) activation is thought to play a key role in acquisition of chemoresistance by cancer cells. We focused on blockade of this activation by using the observation so-called 'desensitization' of NFkappaB using known NFkappaB activator, doxycycline. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The human pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1 was incubated with doxycycline, followed by treatment with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha or paclitaxel. NFkappaB activity and the regulation of NFkappaB-related genes was analyzed. RESULTS: Doxycycline induced sustained NFkappaB activation, followed by desensitization to further NFkappaB activation by TNF-alpha -or paclitaxel, which was accompanied by decreased expression of TNF receptor p55, p75, and epidermal growth factor receptor. Consistent with these observations, doxycycline-pre-treatment resulted in an augmentation of TNF-alpha- and paclitaxel-mediated cytotoxicity and apoptosis. CONCLUSION: These data indicate the possible clinical application of desensitization of NFkappaB to overcome chemoresistance by conventional chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer.
