The effect of meglumine salt of acridonoacetic acid (cycloferon) on the in vivo morphogenesis of influenza infection caused by viruses of different origin (avian, swine and human) and variable susceptibility to antivirals (rimantadine and oseltamivir) has been studied. The administration of cycloferon results in stimulation of the immune response, restriction of the foci of post-influenza pneumonia, and normalization of the structure of respiratory zones independently of the susceptibility or resistance of infectious virus to the drugs. Among virions formed in the lungs of cycloferon-treated mice, prevalence of irregular-shaped virions with defects of surface glycoproteins was observed. The data obtained suggest that cycloferon is a drug with the complex mechanism of activity.
