Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) is a leading cause of human enteritis worldwide and the most frequently reported zoonotic agent in the European Union. Despite the fact that C. jejuni is a microaerobic bacteria, known as a fragile one, it is able to survive through adverse conditions such as oxidative stress. The purpose of this study was first to test the oxidative stress resistance in 22 C. jejuni strains of various origins, and to compare adhesive and invasive abilities of four selected strains in the intestinal cell line Ht-29. Secondly, the effect of an oxidative stress on C. jejuni adhesion to Ht-29 cells was investigated. Results show that all the tested strains were able to survive after a 24-h incubation period in broth containing 10 muM of paraquat. From 12.5 muM of paraquat, bacterial strains exhibit different behaviour, and only three strains are able to survive at 25 muM of paraquat. In addition, this study revealed that the number of bound bacteria to epithelial cells increases with augmentation of paraquat concentration, suggesting a link between oxidative stress survival of C. jejuni and virulence on Ht-29 cells.
