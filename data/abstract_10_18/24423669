Treatment of purulo-necrotic wounds is complicated by process persistence, by microorganisms' multidrug resistance to antibacterial remedies, by nonspecific inflammatory response of nonbacterial origin in soft tissues, as well as by concomitant pathology. The paper was aimed to improve the outcome of treatment of purulent processes in soft tissues. 31 patients with purulent conditions in their soft tissues (among them 14 men and 17 women) were involved in the treatment at the surgical department numero sign1 of the "Emergency hospital". The patients' age ranged from 34 to 73, the average age being 51,4+/-2,38. After the operative treatment, cavitation-vacuum method of treatment of purulent wounds according to a developed technique (a patent of Ukraine numero sign73129, issued on 10.09.2012, newsletter numero sign17) was used. During the postoperative period, the intensity of a pain syndrome, the time of wound cleansing, the amount of wound effluent and its nature, periprocess availability, granulations presence and their nature, skin itch occurrence, the rate of wound healing, terms of placing secondary sutures in the wound, dynamics of microbial cells in the biopsy of the wound, dynamics of leukocytic index of intoxication and duration of staying in hospital after the operation have been studied. The use of the proposed technique of vacuum cavitation treatment of purulent conditions makes the wound cleansing faster, the microbial contamination lesser, reducing the surface of the wound fast, contributing to the development of the granulation tissue and accelerating epithelization processes.
