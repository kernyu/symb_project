In this study, we found that ambroxol hydrochloride (128 mug/mL) exhibits synergistic antifungal effects in combination with fluconazole (2 mug/mL) against resistant planktonic Candida albicans (C. albicans) cells. This combination also exhibited synergistic effects against resistant C. albicans biofilms in different stages (4, 8, and 12 h) according to the microdilution method. In vitro data were further confirmed by the success of this combination in treating Galleria mellonella infected by resistant C. albicans. With respect to the synergistic mechanism, our result revealed that ambroxol hydrochloride has an effect on the drug transporters of resistant C. albicans, increasing the uptake and decreasing the efflux of rhodamine 6G, a fluorescent alternate of fluconazole. This is the first study to investigate the in vitro and in vivo antifungal effects, as well as the possible synergistic mechanism of ambroxol hydrochloride in combination with fluconazole against resistant C. albicans. The results show the potential role for this drug combination as a therapeutic alternative to treat resistant C. albicans and provide insights into the development of antifungal targets and new antifungal agents.
