The emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacterial pathogens has raised global concern. Nontraditional therapeutic strategies, including antivirulence approaches, are gaining traction as a means of applying less selective pressure for resistance in vivo. Here, we show that rigidifying the structure of the siderophore preacinetobactin from MDR Acinetobacter baumannii via oxidation of the phenolate-oxazoline moiety to a phenolate-oxazole results in a potent inhibitor of siderophore transport and imparts a bacteriostatic effect at low micromolar concentrations under infection-like conditions.
