OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of the antimicrobial resistance and genes encoding virulence factors of enterococci isolated in hospitalized burn patients in a major burn center in Ahvaz, southwest of Iran. A total of 340 bacterial isolates were collected from the burn center from February 2014 to February 2015. The antimicrobial susceptibility and MIC of vancomycin were determined using the disk diffusion and micro-agar dilution techniques. The genus and species-specific genes, potential virulence genes, and vanA and vanB genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: According to our results, out of the 340 bacterial isolates, 16.4% (n = 56) were identified as enterococci. Out of the 56 enterococcal isolates, 35 (62.5%) were Enterococcus faecalis and 21 (37.5%) were Enterococcus faecium. More than 20% (n = 5) of E. faecium demonstrated resistance to vancomycin. The gelE and asa genes were the most prevalent virulence genes in E. faecalis (48.5%) and E. faecium (43%) isolates. The emergence of vancomycin resistant E. faecium strains which have several virulence factors should be considered as a major cause of concern for burn centers. Control and management of infections induced by enterococci should be regarded as highly important in burn patients.
