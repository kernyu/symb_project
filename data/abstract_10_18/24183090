OBJECTIVE: To define the general use of anti-infectious treatments in urology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review of national guidelines and articles published on the subject in the Medline database, selected by keywords, depending on the scientific relevance was performed. RESULTS: While the epidemiology clearly shows the non-reduction of the anti-infectious treatments use in France, the resistance increases to highlight foo-resistant germs. Urology is not an exception to this observation, and different means are set to improve the prescription made by urologists. CONCLUSION: The epidemiological observation confirms the urgent need to improve the prescription of anti-infectious treatments particularly in urology.
