The 2017 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) featured exciting preclinical data on investigational antiretroviral agents with good in vitro efficacy and long half-lives. Investigational medications, including bictegravir, demonstrated excellent efficacy and tolerability, as did dual-agent therapy with dolutegravir paired with rilpivirine or with lamivudine. Dolutegravir monotherapy proved inadvisable due to virologic failure and resistance. The gap between high- and low-income settings along the HIV care continuum is narrowing, with Zimbabwe, Malawi, and Zambia approaching the 90-90-90 targets established by the joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), whereas communities in the Southern United States are falling behind. Innovative strategies to improve outcomes include 2-way text messaging, home-based HIV testing, peer navigation, and New York City's realignment of services into comprehensive sexual health programs. A high prevalence of resistance was documented in low- and middle-income settings and policy considerations were modeled to address increasing resistance rates. Novel resistance mutations to integrase strand transfer inhibitors and nucleoside analogue reserve transcriptase inhibitors were identified, but the clinical implications are unclear and require further investigation. Several studies provided insights on dosing and safety of antiretroviral therapy to prevent mother-to-child transmission through pharmacokinetic analysis. A special session devoted to Zika virus included a study of its effects on the central nervous system and a promising animal study of a Zika vaccine.
