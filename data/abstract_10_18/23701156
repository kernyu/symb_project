Spinal tuberculosis is the most common manifestation of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. However, there have been few reports on the topic of drug-resistant spinal tuberculosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of treatment with a combination of surgery and individual chemotherapy guided by drug susceptibility testing for drug-resistant spinal tuberculosis. We retrospectively analyzed 19 patients with drug-resistant spinal tuberculosis. After surgery, individual chemotherapy was tailored for each patient according to his or her drug resistance profile and previous history of chemotherapy. The patients were followed up clinically and radiologically for an average period of 36 months. Among 19 drug-resistant spinal tuberculosis cases, 16 were multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), and 3 were non-MDR-TB. The patients with MDR-TB and non-MDR-TB had undergone previous chemotherapy for an average of 12.50 +/- 2.00 months (0-55 months) and 5.50 +/- 1.20 months (0-60 months), respectively. A total of 16 patients underwent open operations, and the other 3 had percutaneous drainage and local chemotherapy. Patients received individual chemotherapy for an average of 24 months postoperatively. All patients had been cured at the final follow-up. Drug-resistant spinal tuberculosis is mainly acquired through previous irregular chemotherapy and the spread of drug-resistant strains. Treatment with a combination of surgery and individual chemotherapy is feasible in the treatment of severe complications and the prevention of acquired drug resistance.
