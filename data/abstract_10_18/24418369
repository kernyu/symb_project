Southern Israel is inhabited by Bedouins, living in conditions similar to developing countries and Jews, living in conditions similar to developed countries. We determined the epidemiology of Shigella spp. in these populations. We retrospectively reviewed Shigella spp. stool isolations between 2005-2009. Overall, 3295 isolates were analyzed. S. sonnei was isolated in 2057/3295 (62.4%) and S. flexneri in 1058 (32.1%). S. sonnei was isolated in 1567/1707 (91.8%) from Jewish patients and S. flexneri in 931/1542 (60.4%) from Bedouin patients. Ampicillin resistance increased linearly from 217/373 (58.2%) in 2005 to 186/256 (72.7%) in 2009, (P < 0.001). Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance decreased linearly from 328/373 (87.9%) in 2005 to 133/256 (51.9%) in 2009 (P < 0.001). Higher resistance of Shigella spp. to ampicilin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were found in Jewish patients: 1527/1706 (89.5%) versus 977/1542 (63.4%) (P < 0.0001), 1635/1706 (95.8%) versus 1026/1542 (66.5%) (P < 0.0001). The epidemiology of Shigella spp. infections can differ in populations residing in the same geographical area.
