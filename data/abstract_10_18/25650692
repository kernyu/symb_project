BACKGROUND: Staphylococci, especially coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) represent the most frequent micro-organism associated with osteoarticular infections (OAIs), especially those involving orthopedic devices. The antibiotic susceptibility profile of the bacteria mostly responsible for OAIs is therefore crucial information for choosing the appropriate antibiotic regimen administered during the removal procedure until the first results of the conventional culture. METHODS: The antibiotic susceptibility profile of staphylococci isolated from OAIs in a referent center for osteoarticular infection was studied over a 10-y period to adapt antibiotic protocols to the ecology. RESULTS: From 2002 to 2011, the resistance of Staphylococcus aureus to methicillin and rifampicin decreased (27.9% versus 20.6% and 13% versus 1%, respectively); the resistance to fluoroquinolones (FQ) was stable (24% on average), and all the isolates were susceptible to glycopeptides. For CoNS, the resistance to methicillin, rifampicin, and FQ increased (30.4% versus 43.9%, 13% versus 18.5%, and 20.3% versus 34.1%, respectively) over the same period. Resistance of the CoNS to vancomycin was observed in 2011 for the first time (2.3%), and 3.8% were resistant to teicoplanin in 2002 compared with 22% in 2011, with 3.5% resistant to linezolid in 2011. CONCLUSION: The sensibility of bacteria over 10 y remained stable, except for CoNS. The increase of the resistances for CoNS led us to exclude teicoplanin from the first-line empiric antibiotic treatment, to avoid linezolid, and to prefer vancomycin or daptomycin.
