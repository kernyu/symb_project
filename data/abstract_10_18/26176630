We report the case of a 13-year-old boy with cystic fibrosis with a pulmonary exacerbation concomitant to the first isolation of Pandoraea sputorum. The imipenem and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatments failed, with persistence of the bacteria, bronchial congestion and a decline in lung function. Pandoraea sp. is rarely isolated, with only 10 cases reported in France in 2011.
