A once-daily, single-tablet, pangenotypic regimen comprising the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir and the HCV NS5A inhibitor velpatasvir (sofosbuvir/velpatasvir; Epclusa((R))) was recently approved for the treatment of adults with chronic HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 infection in the USA, EU and Canada. In the phase III ASTRAL trials, once-daily oral sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks provided very high rates of sustained virological response at 12 weeks post treatment (SVR12) in treatment-naive and -experienced patients with chronic HCV genotype 1-6 infection, including those with compensated cirrhosis or HIV-1 co-infection. High SVR12 rates were also observed with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir plus ribavirin for 12 weeks in patients with chronic HCV genotype 1-6 infection and decompensated cirrhosis. Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir was generally well tolerated, with low rates of adverse events. Thus, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir represents a valuable treatment option in adults with chronic HCV genotype 1-6 infection, including those with compensated or decompensated cirrhosis, previous treatment experience or HIV-1 co-infection.
