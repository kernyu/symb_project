Liver transplant (LT) recipients are vulnerable to infections with multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens. Risk factors for colonization and infection with resistant bacteria are ubiquitous and unavoidable in transplantation. During the past decade, progress in transplantation and infection prevention has contributed to the decreased incidence of infections with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. However, even in the face of potentially effective antibiotics, vancomycin-resistant enterococci continue to plague LT. Gram-negative bacilli prove to be more problematic and are responsible for high rates of both morbidity and mortality. Despite the licensure of novel antibiotics, there is no universal agent available to safely and effectively treat infections with MDR gram-negative organisms. Currently, efforts dedicated toward prevention and treatment require involvement of multiple disciplines including transplant providers, specialists in infectious diseases and infection prevention, and researchers dedicated to the development of rapid diagnostics and safe and effective antibiotics with novel mechanisms of action.
