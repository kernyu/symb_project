The increasing incidence of infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) or extremely drug-resistant (XDR) gram-negative organisms has led to the reemergence of colistin use. Clinical and demographic data were collected on 94 pediatric patients diagnosed with MDR or XDR gram-negative infections and treated with either a colistin-containing regimen (colistin group) or at least one antimicrobial agent other than colistin (noncolistin group). The overall clinical response rates were 65.8% in the colistin group and 70.0% in the noncolistin group (P = 0.33). The infection-related mortality rates were 11% in the colistin group and 13.3% in the noncolistin group (P = 0.74). There was no statistically significant difference in nephrotoxicity in the colistin and noncolistin groups. Colistin therapy was at least as effective and as safe as beta-lactam antibiotics or quinolones, with or without aminoglycosides, in the treatment of infections caused by gram-negative organisms and may be a therapeutic option in children.
