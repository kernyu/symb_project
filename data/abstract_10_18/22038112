OBJECTIVE: This study was intended to investigate the clinical significance and molecular epidemiology of Acinetobacter baumannii complex (ABC) isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in neurosurgical intensive care unit (NSICU) patients, particularly comparing isolates from healthcare workers' (HCW) hands. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 30 patients with CSF cultures positive for ABC seen at our NSICU from the date it first opened, January 2007, to September 2010. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing was performed on 68 strains isolated from 32 patients' CSF and 36 HCWs' hands. RESULTS: ABC isolates were considered to be clinically significant in 21 (70.0%) patients but insignificant in the other nine (30.0%) patients. The prolonged (>7 days) use of cephalosporins was more common in patients with clinically significant ABC isolates (p = 0.049). Multiple drug resistance (MDR) was observed in 12 (57.1%) clinically significant isolates. Empirical antimicrobial therapies were not appropriate for nine of these 21 patients (42.8%). Mortality was significantly higher in the clinically significant group than in the clinically insignificant group (18/21 vs. 3/9; p = 0.008). Fifty-three isolates (77.9%) were grouped into 15 clusters, three of which contained possibly related isolates from patients' CSF and staff members' hands. CONCLUSIONS: The fact that ABC isolates grown from CSF cultures do not always exhibit infection and have high multiple antibiotic resistance, including to carbapenems, should be borne in mind when planning treatment for these patients. In addition, HCWs' hands may play a significant role in transmission to patients, and compliance with infection control procedures, especially hand washing, must be enhanced in order to avoid ABC infections.
