A carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii expressing blaOXA-23 was recovered from an intensive care unit patient in a third-level hospital from Spain. Genetic analysis showed the association of this carbapenemase with the transposon Tn2007 located in a plasmid of 10 kb. The isolate was classified as ST-1. This strain has shown a potential ability to displace other endemic strains in the hospital and is the first reported identification of A. baumannii carrying blaOXA-23 related to Tn2007 in Spain.
