Colonizations due to carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) are a source of antimicrobial resistance transmission in health care settings. Eleven Citrobacter freundii strains producing KPC-3 carbapenemase were isolated from rectal swabs during a 3-year surveillance program. blaKPC-3-carrying plasmids were found to belong to the IncX3 group in 9 of the 11 strains, and complete nucleotide sequences were obtained for 2 of them. Our results highlight the possible role of C. freundii as reservoir of resistance genes.
