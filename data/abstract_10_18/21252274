We characterized 17 clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae producing 16S rRNA methylase ArmA. The isolates originated in Poland from 2002 to May 2010 and encompassed four XbaI-PFGE clusters. All the isolates were resistant to amikacin, gentamicin and kanamycin (MIC range: 256-1024 mg l(-1)) and carried the armA gene on a large plasmid of approximately 90 or 130 kb in 15 and 2 isolates, respectively. The armA gene was found in a ~10 kb ClaI restriction fragment of the large plasmid and was flanked by the same elements as in Tn1548. All the isolates carried the bla(CTX-M) gene for a CTX-M-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. Our results show that ArmA has disseminated horizontally among K. pneumoniae isolates in Poland on the ~90 kb plasmid of the pCTX-M3 family.
