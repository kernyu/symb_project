LFP-20, a 20-amino acid antimicrobial peptide in the N terminus of porcine lactoferrin, has antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities. This study assessed the protective effects of LFP-20 on LPS-induced intestinal damage in a LPS-induced mouse model and in vitro, using intestinal porcine epithelial cell line 1 (IPEC-1) cells. LFP-20 prevented LPS-induced impairment in colon epithelium tissues, infiltration of macrophages or leukocytes, histological evidence of inflammation and increased levels of TNF-a, IL-6 and IFN-gamma. LFP-20 increased the expression of zonula occludens-1, occludin and claudin-1 and reduced permeability as well as apoptosis of the colon in LPS-treated mice. In IPEC-1 cells, LFP-20 increased transepithelial electrical resistance and tight junction expression. Moreover, we found LFP-20 decreased the MyD88 and AKT levels to affect the NF-kappaB signaling pathway, to modulate inflammation response and tight junction networks in the processing of LPS stimulation. In summary, LFP-20 prevents the inflammatory response and disruption of tight junction structure induced by LPS, suggesting the potential use of LFP-20 as a prophylactic agent to protect intestinal barrier function.
