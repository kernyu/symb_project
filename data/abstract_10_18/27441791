BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the major pathogens responsible for hospital-acquired infections, which harbor a wide array of virulence factors. The main aim of this study was to determine the frequency of the virulent ExoU genotype in relation to the ExoS genotype among isolated P. aeruginosa from infected surgical incisions, followed by phylogenetic analysis. METHODS: A total of 66 P. aeruginosa isolates were identified by cultural and biochemical characteristics. All isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility against the following antimicrobial agents: imipenem, amikacin, gentamicin, amoxycillin, cefotaxime, cefepime, and levofloxacin. Molecular detection of the ExoS and ExoU as well as two other virulence genes was done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Sequencing of ExoU gene and phylogenetic analysis was performed. RESULTS: Approximately 81% of the isolated P. aeruginosa were multi-drug resistant. The ExoS genotype was more prevalent (63%) among the isolates than the ExoU genotype (18%), with 9% of the isolates possessing both toxins. LasB and AprA were detected in 63.6% and 27.2% of the isolates, respectively. An association was observed between the number of virulence genes and the presence of multi-drug resistance. All the ExoU were multi-drug resistant (MDR), whereas 71% of the ExoS were MDR. Phylogenetic analysis of ExoU gene showed a 99% similarity with four different strains. CONCLUSION: Despite the greater frequency of the ExoS genotype, the presence of the virulent MDR ExoU genotype isolates from surgical site infections is an alarming sign requiring further intervention and investigations.
