Various neurological and neuropsychological manifestations are still relatively frequently reported in HIV infected patients in the highly active antiretroviral therapy era. A fraction of them could be related to HIV replication in the central nervous system (CNS) despite adequate peripheral viral suppression. This hypothesis is supported by numerous reports of detectable HIV RNA in the cerebrospinal fluid in the context of a low or undetectable viremia in association with neurological or neuropsychological complaints. In addition, some antiviral molecules may not achieve adequate levels in the CNS, thus potentially favoring intracerebral HIV replication and even antiretroviral resistance. Neurologic manifestations in the presence of CNS HIV replication often decrease after antiretroviral treatment CNS penetration optimization.
