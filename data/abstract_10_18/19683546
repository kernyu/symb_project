Infection of target cells by HIV is a complex, multi-stage process involving attachment to host cells and CD4 binding, coreceptor binding, and membrane fusion. Drugs that block HIV entry are collectively known as entry inhibitors, but comprise a complex group of drugs with multiple mechanisms of action depending on the stage of the entry process at which they act. Two entry inhibitors, maraviroc and enfuvirtide, have been approved for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, and a number of agents are in development. This review covers the entry inhibitors and their use in the management of HIV-1 infection. This article forms part of a special issue of Antiviral Research marking the 25th anniversary of antiretroviral drug discovery and development, Vol 85, issue 1, 2010.
