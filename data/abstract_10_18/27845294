In this article, there are given data of study for antibiotic sensitivity/resistance of gram-positive and gram-negative representatives of different microbial species, isolated from patients after primary hip replacement and osteosynthesis of long bones, which had post operative infectious complications, and also isolated from samples of traumatology department environment. Identification of sensitivity/resistance to antibiotics was performed with use of two methods - disc diffusion and serial dilution on solid nutrient media. It was found, that gram-positive, as well as gram-negative microorganisms had high level of resistance to several penicillins and aminoglycosides. Gram-positive microorganisms had high level of sensitivity to vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, amikacin, amoxiclav, cefazoline, cefuroxim, cefotaxim and cefepim. Gram-negative microorganisms had high level of sensitivity to representatives of ftorhinolones, carbapenems and several cephalosporins. Strains of Candida albicans, showed 100% resistance to nistatine and comparatively high level of sensitivity to such antifungal drugs as diflucan, ketakonasol and amphotericin B. Performed studies once more confirmed significance of microbiological laboratories, which have to be main components of infectious control to dial with infectious complications - performance of permanent microbiological monitoring in separately taken hospitals, that in particular enables effective rotation of antibacterial drugs in that hospitals.
