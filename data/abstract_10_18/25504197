Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, the causal agent of bacterial blight of rice, secretes several cell wall degrading enzymes including cellulase (ClsA) and lipase/esterase (LipA). Prior treatment of rice leaves with purified cell wall degrading enzymes such as LipA can confer enhanced resistance against subsequent X. oryzae pv. oryzae infection. To understand LipA-induced rice defense responses, microarray analysis was performed 12 h after enzyme treatment of rice leaves. This reveals that 867 (720 upregulated and 147 downregulated) genes are differentially regulated (>/=2-fold). A number of genes involved in defense, stress, signal transduction, and catabolic processes were upregulated while a number of genes involved in photosynthesis and anabolic processes were downregulated. The microarray data also suggested upregulation of jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthetic and JA-responsive genes. Estimation of various phytohormones in LipA-treated rice leaves demonstrated a significant increase in the level of JA-Ile (a known active form of JA) while the levels of other phytohormones were not changed significantly with respect to buffer-treated control. This suggests a role for JA-Ile in cell wall damage induced innate immunity. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of ClsA- and LipA-induced rice genes has identified key rice functions that might be involved in elaboration of damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP)-induced innate immunity.
