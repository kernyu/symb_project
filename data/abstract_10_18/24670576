OBJECTIVE: A retrospective clinical trial to evaluate treatment outcomes in adults with smear-positive tuberculosis (TB) and discordant rifampicin (RMP) resistance results. DESIGN: A total of 2156 smear-positive TB patients underwent both conventional and Genechip drug susceptibility testing (DST) for RMP resistance. All 49 patients with discordant results treated with either a first-line or second-line regimen were analysed. RESULTS: Of 30 Type I cases (Genechip-resistant, conventional DST-susceptible) receiving the first-line regimen, 4 had a favourable outcome and 5 failed treatment. The 21 remaining Type I cases were treated with the second-line regimen, of whom 18 had a favourable outcome. Second-line regimen thus resulted in significantly more favourable outcomes than first-line treatment (P = 0.032). Among Type II cases (Genechip-susceptible, conventional DST-resistant), 13/19 received the first-line regimen, and 7 had a favourable outcome. The six Type II cases treated with the second-line regimen all had favourable outcomes. CONCLUSION: Patients with discordant RMP DST results who receive second-line regimens may have a better clinical response than those treated with the first-line regimen. Patients infected with fluoroquinolone-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains were observed to have a significantly higher treatment failure rate.
