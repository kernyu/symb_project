INTRODUCTION: The development of new antimalarial drugs remains of the utmost importance, since Plasmodium falciparum has developed resistance against nearly all chemotherapeutics in clinical use. In an effort to contain the resistance of P. falciparum against artemisinins and to further eradication efforts, studies are ongoing to identify novel and more efficacious approaches to develop antimalarials. AREAS COVERED: The authors review the classical and new approaches to antimalarial drug discovery, with a special emphasis on the various stages of the parasite's life cycle and the different Plasmodium species. The authors discuss the methodologies and strategies for early efficacy testing that aim to narrow down the portfolio of promising compounds. EXPERT OPINION: The increased efforts in the discovery and development of new antimalarial compounds have led to the recognition of new promising hits. However, there is still major roadblock of selecting the most promising compounds and then further testing them in early clinical trials, especially in the current restricted economy. Controlled human malaria infection has much potential for speeding-up the early development process of many drug candidates including those which target the pre-erythrocytic stages.
