Enrofloxacin is the most commonly used antibiotic to control diseases in aquatic animals caused by A. hydrophila. This study conducted de novo transcriptome sequencing and compared the global transcriptomes of enrofloxacin-resistant and enrofloxacin-susceptible strains. We got a total of 4,714 unigenes were assembled. Of these, 4,122 were annotated. A total of 3,280 unigenes were assigned to GO, 3,388 unigenes were classified into Cluster of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COG) using BLAST and BLAST2GO software, and 2,568 were mapped onto pathways using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes Pathway database. Furthermore, 218 unigenes were deemed to be DEGs. After enrofloxacin treatment, 135 genes were upregulated and 83 genes were downregulated. The GO terms biological process (126 genes) and metabolic process (136 genes) were the most enriched, and the terms for protein folding, response to stress, and SOS response were also significantly enriched. This study identified enrofloxacin treatment affects multiple biological functions of A. hydrophila. Enrofloxacin resistance in A. hydrophila is closely related to the reduction of intracellular drug accumulation caused by ABC transporters and increased expression of topoisomerase IV.
