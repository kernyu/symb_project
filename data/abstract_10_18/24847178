BACKGROUND: Extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli has tremendously increased worldwide and it is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality associated with hospital-acquired infections. This could be attributed to association of multi drug resistance in ESBL producing isolates. The present study was aimed to determine the antimicrobial sensitivity profile of ESBL producing E. coli isolates from various clinical samples. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical samples, which consist of pus, urine, blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), stool, sputum, swabs, and different body fluids, are included in the study. Samples were processed and identified as per routine laboratory protocol. ESBL screening and confirmation along with antimicrobial susceptibility test was done according to the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. RESULTS: Out of 180 third generation cephalosporins resistant E. coli, 100 (55.55%) isolates were ESBL producers showing a greater degree of resistance to antibiotics. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of ESBL is increasing day by day in nearly every center of different countries and necessary steps to prevent the spread and emergence of resistance should be taken.
