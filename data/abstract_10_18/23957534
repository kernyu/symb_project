Co-presenting non-antibiotic drugs and pyrimidinethiol on gold nanoparticles (NPs) can generate broad-spectrum antibacterial and bactericidal activities against superbugs. Dimethylbiguanide (metformin), an anti-hyperglycemic drug, shows the best enhanced activity via increasing the ability to compromise bacterial cell walls. Synergistic effects are also reflected in the eradicating biofilm cells. Our findings suggest a large chemical space to develop new antibacterial materials to treat superbugs.
