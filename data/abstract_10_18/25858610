Initial treatment with dolutegravir offers higher efficacy than treatment with efavirenz, darunavir/ritonavir and even with raltegravir in patients with a high viral load. Like ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors, dolutegravir will probably have a high genetic barrier to resistance and prior genetic testing will not be required in integrase inhibitor-naive patients. The drug is well tolerated and associated with few treatment discontinuations. It can be administered once daily and the tablet size is small. A fixed-dose combination tablet containing dolutegravir, abacavir and lamivudine will soon be available. Dolutegravir has few interactions with commonly-used drugs. It does not require pharmacological boosting and has no food or time of day restrictions. Because of these characteristics, dolutegravir has a unique profile and is the ideal drug for most HIV-infected patients.
