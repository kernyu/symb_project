INTRODUCTION: Actually, epidemiology of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing enterobacteriaceae is increasing worldwide, especially in urinary tract infections (UTI). The objective of the study was to investigate the epidemiology of ESBL producers in a department of urology. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective, monocentric study, which included all patients with positive culture showing an ESBL producing enterobacteriaceae in a department of urology between 2005 and 2009 included. RESULTS: The prevalence of ESBL producers in UTI was 2/113 (1.8%) in 2005 and 3/196 (1.5%) in 2009 (P=0.87). Twenty-seven isolates were included: 66.7% of Escherichia coli, 11.1% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 11.1% of Enterobacter cloacae. ESBL producers were resistant to another antibiotic family in 24 cases (88.8%). The mean age in this study was 70.4 years, 70% of patients had another antibiotherapy in the past 6 months, 87% an hospitalization within 90% had surgery. Among the patients, 56.5% had a material. The infection was community-acquired in three cases only. Thirty-five percent of patients had no symptoms, 26% presented with severe sepsis. CONCLUSION: This report was a five-year retrospective study of BLSE-positive bacteria showing the nosocomial infection with ESBL producers and their multiresistance to usual antibiotics without any increase of their prevalence.
