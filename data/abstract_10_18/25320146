OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to evaluate the clinical experience with daptomycin in the treatment of resistant gram-positive infections (GPIs) in patients with HIV infection. METHODS: Using a retrospective, multicenter, and observational registry study, investigators assessed outcomes following daptomycin therapy in 78 patients (62 efficacy evaluable) infected with HIV and with resistant GPIs. RESULTS: Overall, success rates by infection type were bacteremia 91% (20 of 22), endocarditis 91% (10 of 11), and bone/joint 100% (9 of 9). Success by pathogen was 93% (39 of 42), 93% (14 of 15), and 100% (5 of 5) for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, respectively. Daptomycin appeared to be well tolerated, with 9% having an adverse event possibly related to daptomycin and 4% discontinuing daptomycin. CONCLUSIONS: In HIV-infected patients, daptomycin appears to be a useful agent for treating resistant GPIs.
