OBJECTIVES: The aim of this paper is to test whether alpha-defensins and bacterial/permeability-increasing protein were related to obesity and cardiovascular risk factors in prepubertal children. METHODS: Plasma alpha-defensins and bacterial/permeability-increasing protein, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, systolic blood pressure (SBP), carotid intima media thickness (cIMT), HOMA-IR and HMW-adiponectin were assessed. RESULTS: In a cross-sectional study (N = 250), higher alpha-defensins concentrations were positively associated with BMI, waist, SBP, cIMT, HOMA-IR and negative correlated with HMW-adiponectin (all between r = 0.191 and r = 0.377, p </= 0.01 and p </= 0.0001). Conversely, plasma bacterial/permeability-increasing protein concentrations presented inversed associated with the same parameters (all between r = -0.124 and r = -0.329; p </= 0.05 and p </= 0.0001). In a longitudinal study (N = 91), alpha-defensins at age 7 were associated with BMI (beta = 0.189, p = 0.002; model R(2) = 0.847) and waist (beta = 0.241, pthinsp;= 0.001; model R(2) = 0.754) at age 10. CONCLUSIONS: alpha-Defensins and bacterial/permeability-increasing protein may be the markers of childhood obesity. Increased concentrations of alpha-defensins may predict BMI and abdominal fat deposition in children.
