Antimicrobial-resistant pathogens are of increasing concern in the neonatal intensive care unit population. A myriad of resistance mechanisms exist in microorganisms, and management can be complex because broad-spectrum antibiotics are increasingly needed. Control and prevention of antibiotic-resistant organisms (AROs) require an interdisciplinary team with continual surveillance. Judicious use of antibiotics; minimizing exposure to risk factors, when feasible; and effective hand hygiene are crucial interventions to reduce infection and transmission of AROs.
