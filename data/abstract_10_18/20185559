Although disclosure has many proven benefits for mental health, psychosocial development, caregiver well-being, treatment adherence and future planning, such a process is still often met with resistance. This article discusses the main reasons given for delaying or avoiding disclosure of a child's HIV status. Each barrier to disclosure is discussed and debunked as an insufficient reason to delay the positive benefits that the disclosure process has shown to produce.
