Modification of the Lipid A phosphates by positively charged appendages is a part of the survival strategy of numerous opportunistic Gram-negative bacteria. The phosphate groups of the cystic fibrosis adapted Burkholderia Lipid A are abundantly esterified by 4-amino-4-deoxy-beta-L-arabinose (beta-L-Ara4N), which imposes resistance to antibiotic treatment and contributes to bacterial virulence. To establish structural features accounting for the unique pro-inflammatory activity of Burkholderia LPS we have synthesised Lipid A substituted by beta-L-Ara4N at the anomeric phosphate and its Ara4N-free counterpart. The double glycosyl phosphodiester was assembled by triazolyl-tris-(pyrrolidinyl)phosphonium-assisted coupling of the beta-L-Ara4N H-phosphonate to alpha-lactol of beta(1-->6) diglucosamine, pentaacylated with (R)-(3)-acyloxyacyl- and Alloc-protected (R)-(3)-hydroxyacyl residues. The intermediate 1,1'-glycosyl-H-phosphonate diester was oxidised in anhydrous conditions to provide, after total deprotection, beta-L-Ara4N-substituted Burkholderia Lipid A. The beta-L-Ara4N modification significantly enhanced the pro-inflammatory innate immune signaling of otherwise non-endotoxic Burkholderia Lipid A.
