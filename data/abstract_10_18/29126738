A new series of oxadiazolylbiphenylthiazoles was prepared with the objective of improving the limited solubility of first-generation derivatives while maintaining antibacterial activity against drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Studying the structure-activity relationship at the cationic part provided the piperazine-1-carboximidamide derivative 27 with a MIC (MRSA) value of 1.1 mug/mL, bactericidal mode of action, and a 50-fold improvement in aqueous solubility. Additionally, 27 exhibited a wider safety margin against mammalian cells, and most importantly, a significant improvement in oral bioavailability.
