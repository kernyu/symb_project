Nasal colonization by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was evaluated after a mupirocin treatment in a family previously colonized by MRSA sequence type ST398 and ST1, who lived close to a pig farm. Eight nasal samples were swabbed from each of the four family members on different moments after mupirocin treatment. The efficacy of treatment was low in those family members who worked in the farm, and higher in the remaining two family members with sporadic contact with pigs. In addition, nasal and skin swabs from randomly selected pigs of the farm were taken. MRSA were detected in 33% of pigs tested. All MRSA isolates obtained were characterized by Staphylococcal-Cassette-Chromosome mec (SCCmec) determination, Multilocus-Sequence-Typing (MLST), spa- and agr-typing, Pulsed-field-gel-electrophoresis (PFGE), antimicrobial susceptibility, detection of antimicrobial resistance genes, and toxin gene profiling. Spa-types t011, t1255 and t1197 were detected in humans and animals, with indistinguishable PFGE patterns, suggesting animal to human MRSA transmission. Each spa-type was ascribed to a specific pulsotype. Spa-types t127 and t108 were only detected in MRSA isolates obtained from humans, and t012 only in those from animals. MRSA ST1-t127 isolates and some ST398-t011 and ST398-t1197 isolates presented a multiantimicrobial-resistance phenotype. None of them harbored lukF/lukS, tst, eta and etb virulence genes. This study showed that the efficacy of nasal MRSA decolonization in healthy people with very close contact with pigs is especially low.
