There is a constant need to identify novel inhibitors to combat beta-lactamase-mediated antibiotic resistance. In this study, we identify three penicillinase-binding peptides, P1 (DHIHRSYRGEFD), P2 (NIYTTPWGSNWS), and P3 (SHSLPASADLRR), using a phage display library. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is utilized for quantitative determination and comparison of the binding specificity of selected peptides to penicillinase. An SPR biosensor functionalized with P3-GGGC (SHSLPASADLRRGGGC) is developed for detection of penicillinase with excellent sensitivity (15.8 RU nM(-1)) and binding affinity (KD = 0.56 nM). To determine if peptides can be good inhibitors for penicillinase, these peptides are mixed with penicillinase and their inhibition efficiency is determined by measuring the hydrolysis of substrate penicillin G using UV-vis spectrophotometry. Peptide P2 (NIYTTPWGSNWS) is found to be a promising penicillinase inhibitor with a Ki of 9.22 muM and a Ki' of 33.12 muM, suggesting that the inhibition mechanism is a mixed pattern. This peptide inhibitor (P2) can be used as a lead compound to identify more potent small molecule inhibitors for penicillinase. This study offers a potential approach to both detection of beta-lactamases and development of novel inhibitors of beta-lactamases.
