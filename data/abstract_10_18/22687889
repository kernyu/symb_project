BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence that the standard triple therapy against Helicobacter pylori infection is losing clinical effectiveness. A triple therapy regimen with levofloxacin, amoxicillin and a proton pump inhibitor has been reported to be effective and well tolerated, and this regimen has been suggested as an alternative first-line treatment. The aim of this single-blind randomized clinical trial was to compare the eradication success of two first-line triple therapy regimens in the north of Spain: clarithromycin, amoxicillin and omeprazole (CAO) versus levofloxacin, amoxicillin and omeprazole (LAO). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 250 consecutive patients diagnosed by conventional methods with H. pylori infection were randomized into one of two 10 day therapeutic regimens: standard CAO (n = 128) or LAO (n = 122). Eradication was confirmed by the (13)C-urea breath test. Adverse effects and compliance were also assessed. The clinical trial registration number was HPL08001HCLAD (EudraCT: 2008-001892-31). RESULTS: Intention-to-treat cure rates were: CAO, 75.0% (96/128; 95% CI: 66.6%-82.2%) and LAO, 82.8% (101/122; 95% CI: 74.9%-89.0%). Per-protocol cure rates were: CAO, 78.0% (96/123; 95% CI: 69.7%-85.0%) and LAO, 83.1% (98/118; 95% CI: 75.0%-89.3%). There were no statistically significant differences in effectiveness between the two regimens. In addition, no relevant differences in compliance or adverse effects were demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: Levofloxacin-based treatment for H. pylori infection did not improve upon the eradication rate of the standard clarithromycin-based triple therapy in this study. This may reflect the progressive increase in in vitro resistance rates to levofloxacin observed in our region.
