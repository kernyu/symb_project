A large survey of antimicrobial resistance of Helicobacter pylori was performed in France in 2014: 984 patients were enrolled by 75 gastroenterologists all over the country. Among the 783 patients who had never received eradication treatment before, 266 (33.9%) were H. pylori positive. The strains showed a high rate of clarithromycin resistance (22.2%), moderate rate of resistance to levofloxacin (15.4%) and high rate of resistance to metronidazole (45.9%). In all, 187 patients had received previous treatment, of which 115 were H. pylori positive with very high resistance to clarithromycin (73.9%) and metronidazole (78.3%). None of the patients receiving PYLERA (Bismuth salt-Tetracycline HCl-Metronidazole) proton-pump inhibitor developed resistance to tetracycline. A real-time PCR applied to gastric biopsy specimens detected all the cases that were positive by culture as well as 30 additional cases. A good correlation was found between the clarithromycin resistance detected by phenotypic methods and the associated mutations for clarithromycin resistance, which has continued to increase in the last decade but at a lower rate than previously observed.
