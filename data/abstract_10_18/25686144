Fluoroquinolone (FQ) drug susceptibility testing (DST) is an important step in the design of effective treatment regimens for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Here we compare ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and moxifloxacin (MFX) resistance results from 226 multidrug-resistant samples. The low level of concordance observed suggests that DST should be performed for the specific FQ planned for clinical use. The results also support the new World Health Organization recommendation for testing MFX at a critical concentration of 2.0 mug/ml.
