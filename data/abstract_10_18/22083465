Complete sequencing of plasmid pOXA-48a carrying the bla(OXA-48) gene from a Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate was performed. Its backbone corresponded to that of an IncL/M-type plasmid, in which the bla(OXA-48) gene had been integrated through the acquisition of the Tn1999 composite transposon without any other antibiotic resistance gene. Molecular epidemiology using a collection of international OXA-48 producers revealed the wide diffusion of pOXA-48a or closely related plasmids.
