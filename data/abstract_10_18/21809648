AIM: Development of test system for the evaluation of sensitivity of Trichomonas vaginalis to preparations of the 5-nitroimidazole and 5-nitrofuran groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Determination of minimal cidic concentration (MCC) of antiprotozoal preparations was carried out by cultivating laboratory T. vaginalis strains in wells of plates with nutrient medium containing varying concentrations of these preparations. Evaluation of vitality of the agent was determined by using trypan blue vital stain and bysubsequent growth ability in nutrient medium without antiprotozoal preparations. Construction of the test system was carried out by selecting conditions for the fixation of preparations in the plate wells and control of activity retention after the fixation. 109 isolates from patients with confirmed trichomoniasis diagnosis were used for the approbation of the test system. RESULTS: Cultivation of 10 strains showed that MCC of investigated preparations had the following values: metronidazole 5, tinidazole 1.25; secnidazole 2.5; nimorazole 1.25; ornidazole 2.5; clotrimazole 15; nifuratel 1.25 microg/ml. Studies of clinical material revealed single-type sensitivity of strains isolated during acute trichomoniasis, and varying--during chronic, while one strain had multidrug resistance. CONCLUSION: A simple test system available for routine laboratory work for the evaluation of sensitivity of T. vaginalis to preparations of the 5-nitroimidazole and 5-nitrofuran groups was developed. The efficacy of the test ensures high sensitivity, reproducibility and shorter procedure time as compared with classical method, thus allowing the selection of preparation for therapy with the highest probability.
