The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae bloodstream infections on mortality. During the study period 42, 68 and 120 patients were identified with carbapenem-resistant, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers (ESBL) and susceptible K. pneumoniae bloodstream infections, respectively. Patients with carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae had higher rates of prior antimicrobial exposure, other nosocomial infections, and use of invasive devices. Infection-related mortality was 48% for carbapenem-resistant, 22% for ESBL producers and 17% for susceptible K. pneumoniae. Independent risk factors for infection-related mortality were Pitt bacteraemia score, Charlson score and carbapenem resistance.
