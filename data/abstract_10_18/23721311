Despite the success in antimicrobial development, the rapid emergence of pathogenic bacteria resistance to conventional antibiotics calls for an increased focus on the purification and characterization of new antimicrobials. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are promising candidates in future therapeutics. In addition to their broad array of antimicrobial activity, these peptides show multi advent function to human health. The marine environment is relatively poorly explored in terms of potential pharmaceuticals. It contains a tremendous organism diversity which would be a good source of novel AMPs. In this present review we discuss recent antimicrobial peptides isolated from both marine fish and marine invertebrates. We also mention the isolation and benefit of these marine-derived natural antibiotics.
