We document the presence of a Rhipicephalus microplus tick population resistant to acaricides (organophosphates (OP), synthetic pyrethroids (SP), amitraz) and macrocyclic lactones (ML) (ivermectin). Engorged females of R. microplus were collected from a cattle farm in Veracruz, Mexico, to evaluate acaricide and ivermectin resistance. The modified larval packet test (LPT) was used to detect OP (chlorpiriphos and diazinon) and SP (flumethrin, deltamethrin and cypermethrin) resistance and the larval immersion test (LIT) to detect resistance to amitraz and ivermectin. Both, LPT and LIT were performed twice at different times with different collected samples. Mortality data with ivermectin were subjected to probit analysis to obtain lethal concentrations and resistance ratios (RR) using an ivermectin-susceptible strain (Deutch) as a reference. The R. microplus population showed resistance to all acaricides tested, with different mortalities at the discriminate dose: chlorpiriphos (1%), diazinon (24.2%), flumethrin (92.8%), deltamethrin (94.2%), cypermethrin (98.0%) and amitraz (1.5%). The studied tick population also showed resistance to ivermectin with a resistance ratio at 99% of 9.58 and 6.52 in the first and second evaluation, respectively. We report for the first time a R. microplus population in Mexico with different levels of resistance to OP, SP, amidines (Am) and ivermectin. The uncontrolled use of these products in the study area may promote the complete failure of tick control within a short period of time.
