BACKGROUND: Resistance to anti-tuberculosis drugs threatens to undermine effective control of tuberculosis (TB). In areas with weak TB control and misuse of anti-tuberculosis drugs, hotspots of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) have appeared. The aim of this review is to determine the prevalence rate of any anti-tuberculosis drug resistance, monoresistance and MDR-TB in Ethiopia. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature on any resistance, monoresistance and MDR-TB was conducted. RESULTS: Of the total 468 articles found using electronic search, 14 met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. The prevalence rate of any drug resistance, polyresistance and MDR-TB was respectively 6.7-72.9%, 0-54% and 0-46%. A higher rate of streptomycin monoresistance (1.5-20.4%) was observed. CONCLUSION: The prevalence and distribution of drug-resistant TB remains a serious public health problem in Ethiopia. Rapid, advanced diagnostic tools should be introduced, along with strong treatment and follow-up strategies.
