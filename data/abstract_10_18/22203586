Efavirenz concentrations were measured in 21 patients during an interruption cycle of the ANRS 106 Window trial. The median efavirenz concentrations in the patients 12 h, 3 days, and 7 days after discontinuation of the drug were 1,962 ng/ml, 416 ng/ml, and 112 ng/ml, respectively. The half-life ranged from 27 to 136 h. No relationship between efavirenz exposure and detection of nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutations was demonstrated. Patients who were treated by a lamivudine- or emtricitabine-based regimen had a lower risk of NNRTI mutation selection.
