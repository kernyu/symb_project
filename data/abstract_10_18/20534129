BACKGROUND: A bacterial artificial chromosomal library of Planobispora rosea, a genetically intractable actinomycete strain, was constructed using Escherichia coli-Streptomyces artificial chromosome (ESAC) and screened for the presence of genes known to be involved in the biosynthesis of antibiotics. RESULTS: One clone with a 40 kb insert showed antimicrobial activity against Gram positive bacteria. Insert sequence analysis and subcloning experiments revealed that the bioactivity was due to a 3.5 kb DNA fragment containing two open reading frames. These orfs encode two proteins with high similarity to a putative membrane protein of Streptomyces coelicolor and to the nogalamycin resistance protein SnorO of Streptomyces nogalater, respectively. The role of these two Orfs is unknown in Planobispora. Disruption and complementation experiments revealed that both proteins are necessary for the antibacterial activity and chemical analysis demonstrated that the antibiotic activity was due to thiostrepton, antibiotic used as recombinant clone selection marker. CONCLUSION: Two Planobispora rosea orfs are responsible for increasing intracellular amounts and storage of thiostrepton in Streptomyces lividans.
