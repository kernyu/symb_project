New antibiotic options are needed for the treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas infections. We present a case of a man aged 64 years with a bladder fistula due to radiation, ultimately causing osteomyelitis of the pubic symphysis. Repeated antibiotic courses, without correcting the fistula, resulted in infection with MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa. He was successfully treated for his osteomyelitis through cystectomy, aggressive debridement and a prolonged course of antimicrobials directed at the MDR Pseudomonas isolate.
