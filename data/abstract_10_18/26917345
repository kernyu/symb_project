BACKGROUND: Suppressive therapy in patients with genital herpes has been used in Japan since 2006. Susceptibility and resistance of herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 to acyclovir were examined in genital isolates from patients receiving suppressive therapy and compared with those from those naive to acyclovir and receiving episodic treatment with acyclovir. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of acyclovir use on the susceptibility to acyclovir and analysis of the thymidine kinase gene by acyclovir treatment. METHODS: Genital HSV isolates were obtained from three patients groups. Susceptibility to acyclovir, the frequency of acyclovir-resistant clones and mutations in the thymidine kinase gene of acyclovir-resistant clones were determined. RESULTS: Susceptibility to ACV was significantly higher in isolates from patients receiving suppressive therapy than those naive to acyclovir and receiving episodic treatment, but the frequencies of resistant clones were similar among the three groups. Mutation in guanosine homopolymeric strings (G-string mutation) was significantly more frequent in clones during episodic treatment and suppressive therapy than clones from patients naive to ACV. The frequency of G-string mutation was significantly less frequent in isolates from patients naive to ACV than those experienced ACV therapy. CONCLUSION: The frequency of acyclovir-resistant mutants was not increased by episodic and suppressive therapy, but exposure to acyclovir significantly generated G-string mutations, possibly induced by acyclovir. Acyclovir therapy had no substantial effects on the susceptibility of HSV-2 or frequency of resistant virus but did generate subclinical G-string mutants in patients' HSV-2.
