Enhanced endogenous interferon (IFN) stimulated gene (ISG) signature has been associated with nonresponsiveness to hepatitis C treatment using pegylated-IFNalpha (pegIFNalpha) and ribavirin (RBV) in human immunodeficiency virus/hepatitis C virus (HIV/HCV) coinfected patients. Using a proteomic approach, we identified high levels of IFNalpha receptor 2a (IFNalphaR2a) in the serum of null responders to pegIFNalpha/RBV. IFNalphaR2a inhibited antiviral activity of all formulations of IFNalpha in JFH/Huh7.5 cells. Furthermore, serum from null responders, but not from those who achieved sustained virologic response, suppressed IFN-signaling and ISG expression in IFNalpha-stimulated PBMCs of healthy donors in an IFNalphaR2a specific fashion. An IFNalphaR2a transgenic mice model (C57BL/6) was generated that had significantly higher levels of IFNalphaR2a in the serum than the controls (P=0.001). Total ISG expression in the lymph nodes was significantly higher compared to wild-type mice (P value=0.0016). In addition, IFITM1 and SP110 had significantly increased expression in the liver, IFITM1 and ISG15 in the lymph node, and ISG15 and PLSCR1 in the spleen (P value<0.05). The underlying mechanism of resistance to hepatitis C treatment may involve transsignaling of the JAK/STAT pathway by the sIFNalphaR2a-IFNalpha/beta complex and result in the enhanced ISG signature observed in null responders. In this regard, the transgenic mice model simulated nonresponders to IFNalpha therapy and provides valuable insights into the role of sIFNalphaR2a-IFNalpha interactions in vivo.
