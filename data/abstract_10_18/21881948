Infectious myositis may be caused by a wide variety of bacterial, fungal, viral, and parasitic agents. Parasitic myositis is most commonly a result of trichinosis, cystericercosis, or toxoplasmosis, but other parasites may be involved. A parasitic cause of myositis is suggested by history of residence or travel to endemic area and presence of eosinophilia. The diagnosis of parasitic myositis is suggested by the clinical picture and radiologic imaging, and the etiologic agent is confirmed by parasitologic, serologic, and molecular methods, together with histopathologic examination of tissue biopsies. Therapy is based on the clinical presentation and the underlying pathogen. Drug resistance should be put into consideration in different geographic areas, and it can be avoided through the proper use of anti-parasitic drugs.
