Therapeutic drug monitoring is a cornerstone of antibacterial therapy, especially in an era of increasing antibacterial resistance in individualizing antimicrobial therapy. Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay was used for the simultaneous measurement of piperacillin, tazobactam, meropenem, ceftazidime, and linezolid in 50 mul plasma samples over a wide range. The overall turnaround time for the assay was 20 minutes. Intra-assay precision and accuracy for quality control samples ranged within 1.8-8.5 and 91.4-106.7%, respectively. Inter-assay precision and accuracy ranged within 1.3-14.4 and 95.8-104.6%, respectively. The lower limit of quantification was below 1.5 mug/ml for all the five antibiotics. No ion suppression due to matrix effects was found. A simple and rapid LC-MS/MS method which provides high specificity, precision and accuracy for the simultaneous quantification of piperacillin, tazobactam, meropenem, ceftazidime, and linezolid in human plasma has been developed and validated. The present method is suitable for therapeutic drug monitoring in paediatrics.
