Antimicrobial resistance increases it health, social and economic impact. in all areas (state, regional and local), initiatives to try to contain the problem of resistance arise. In the update of this year 2016, we study microbiological, epidemiological and clinical aspects of multi-resistant bacteria, as well as resources for therapeutic approach, from ancient to modern drugs from therapeutic combinations to optimization Stewardship programs. In the case of fungal infection, we analyze clinical scenarios with different species in yeast or new clinical settings in filamentous fungi. Taking paediatric population, homologies and differences with adults in invasive fungal infection were compared. Finally in the field of parasitology, treatment of severe malaria imported or that resistant to antimalarial drugs were reviewed.
