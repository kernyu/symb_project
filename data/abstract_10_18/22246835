A novel detection system was established previously for cells infected with the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in vitro that utilizes the unique IE1-dependent nuclear dispersion of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies early in the HCMV replication cycle. This assay system, designated "the PML assay," makes use of the GFP-PML-expressing cell line SE/15, and allows real-time monitoring of infected cells by fluorescence microscopy without any staining procedures. A rapid and quantitative drug susceptibility testing was developed for low-titer clinical isolates propagated in fibroblasts in vitro. The present study sought to exploit the PML assay for evaluating in vivo status of HCMV without virus isolation. Progeny viruses were detected directly from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) infected in vivo obtained from hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients. The overall positivity of the PML assay tended to correlate with the levels of genomic DNA. Direct phenotypic susceptibility testing detected one ganciclovir (GCV)-resistant case among 19 samples, which was confirmed further by genomic and plaque reduction assays. However, in another patient with the sequence-proven mutant confirmed by sequencing, the progeny viruses exhibiting GCV-resistance were not detected. Studies on the isolated virus from the latter patient suggested the possibility that replication efficiency may differ between PBMCs and lesions infected in vivo, which may hamper the detection of GCV-resistant viruses by the PML assay, at least in this case. Taken together, the PML assay is sufficiently sensitive to monitor replication-competent HCMV directly from PBMCs infected in vivo, and provides a novel tool for comparing the characteristics of HCMV strains infected in vivo.
