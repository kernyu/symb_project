From December 2006 to April 2009, we conducted an etiology study among Cambodian patients presenting with acute fever of unknown origin. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi was detected in 0.9% (41/4985) blood cultures. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed decreased susceptibility to ampicillin (56% resistant; MIC(90), >256 microg/mL), chloramphenicol (56% resistant; MIC(90), >256 microg/mL), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (56% resistant; MIC(90), >256 microg/mL), nalidixic acid (81% resistant; MIC(90), not defined), ciprofloxacin (0% resistant; MIC(90), 0.5 microg/mL), and ceftriaxone (0% resistant; MIC(90), 0.094 microg/mL). Multidrug resistance, defined as antimicrobial resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, was found in 56% of the isolates, and 80% had reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (defined as MIC > or =0.12 microg/mL).
