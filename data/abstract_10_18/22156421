Plasmids pRSB113 and pRSB115 were recovered from an activated sludge bacterial community of a municipal wastewater treatment plant in Germany. Both plasmids carry the same bla(GES-5) carbapenemase gene, located within two distinct class 1 integrons. These plasmids have different backbones, belong to different incompatibility groups, and could replicate in both Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli.
