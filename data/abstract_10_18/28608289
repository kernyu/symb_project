Due to the increasing selection and prevalence of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria and the insufficient development of novel antibiotics, the responsible and prudent use of the available antimicrobial drugs is of major importance. In Germany the rational use of anti-infectives considering the local antimicrobial resistance situation is defined in the infection protection act of 2011. An important tool to follow legal regulations and to improve the treatment of bacterial infections is the antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) concept. Hospitals implementing an AMS program charge a multidisciplinary team of experts to develop and monitor treatment standards and to establish a system of regular consultations and ward rounds. Objectives of this set of measures are the optimization of the individual treatment outcome and on a longer range the improvement of the epidemiological situation. AMS programs include all clinical disciplines that use antimicrobials. Trauma surgery is also affected in a special way as soon as complicated infections and those with multidrug-resistant bacteria are treated.
