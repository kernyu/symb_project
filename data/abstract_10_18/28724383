BACKGROUND: The increasing resistance of Acinetobacter baumannii to antibiotics has recently been regarded as a notable therapeutic difficulty. Evaluating resistance rates of some A. baumannii isolates to tetracyclines had an impact on understanding the antibiotic resistance dissemination. By comparing genetic characteristics and relatedness of A. baumannii isolates, we are able to determine the transition dynamics of outbreak isolates. METHODS: A total of 72 non-duplicate isolates of A. baumannii were recovered in 2011 and 2015 and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) range distribution of the isolates to tetracyclines was performed by broth micro dilution (BMD) assay, and to determine the lineage relatedness of the outbreak isolates repetitive extragenic palindromic element based on polymerase chain reaction (rep-PCR) and international clonal (ICs) investigations were performed. RESULTS: Resistance rates to tetracycline, doxycycline and minocycline in 2011 were 73, 2 and 0%, while these rates in 2015 increased up to 90, 84 and 52%, respectively. The tetB existed in 100% of all the isolates of both years. tetA was not found in any of the isolates. According to the rep-PCR assays, up to 83% of all isolates clustered distinctly and only 6% of isolates had a common root. The percentage rates of IC1 decreased from 42% in 2011 to 22% in 2015, while those of IC2 increased from 28 to 36%, from 2011 to 2015. CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed that resistance to the first and second generations of tetracyclines is on the rise and the clonal transition dynamics of isolates are in progress in our hospital.
