Pantothenamides (PanAms) are analogues of pantothenate, the biosynthetic precursor of coenzyme A (CoA), and show potent antimicrobial activity against several bacteria and the malaria parasite in vitro. However, pantetheinase enzymes that normally degrade pantetheine in human serum also act on the PanAms, thereby reducing their potency. In this study, we designed analogues of the known antibacterial PanAm N-heptylpantothenamide (N7-Pan) to be resistant to pantetheinase by using three complementary structural modification strategies. We show that, while two of these are effective in imparting resistance, the introduced modifications have an impact on the analogues' interaction with pantothenate kinase (PanK, the first CoA biosynthetic enzyme), which acts as a metabolic activator and/or target of the PanAms. This, in turn, directly affects their mode of action. Importantly, we discover that the phosphorylated version of N7-Pan shows pantetheinase resistance and antistaphylococcal activity, providing a lead for future studies in the ongoing search of PanAm analogues that show in vivo efficacy.
