Objective: To investigated the etiologic characteristics of Shigella (S.) sonnei strains causing outbreaks and sporadic cases in some areas of Guangdong province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region during 2014-2016. Methods: Fourteen S. sonnei strains isolated from outbreaks and 6 S. sonnei strains from sporadic cases from Guangdong and Liuzhou of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region were tested for antimicrobial resistance and analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Six typical strains were selected for whole genome sequencing typing and compared with 51 strains isolated both at home and abroad from NCBI genome database. Results: The antibiotic resistance test indicated the isolates had high resistance rate to ampicillin, tetracycline, gentamicin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and nalidixic acid, while sensitive to azithromycin, chloromycetin and imipenem. PFGE showed high similarity (93.2%) among the strains isolated from different areas. The whole genome sequencing analysis also revealed that all the typical strains were clustered into a same evolution branch, close to some strains from Korea. Conclusions: The S. sonnei strains isolated from some areas of Guangdong and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region showed high resistance to commonly used antibiotics, but they were sensitive to azithromycin, chloramphenicol and imipenem. The isolates in this study also showed similar PFGE patterns and close phylogenic evolution.
