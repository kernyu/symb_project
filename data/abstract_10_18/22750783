Staphylococcal infections have high occurrence in Jordanian patients. This study was carried out to determine the rates of high- and low-level mupirocin resistance (MupH and MupL) among staphylococci with the molecular characterization. Two hundred and thirty-two non-duplicate Staphylococcus spp. isolated from different clinical specimens were tested for mupirocin susceptibility using disk diffusion method and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Resistance genes and clone relatedness was studied using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus primers (Eric-PCR) for the latter. Plasmid curing was performed to determine the genetic location of MupA gene. Among the 232 strains, 144 (62%) were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 33 (14.2%) methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and 55 (23.7%) were of other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (CoNS). Of all strains tested, only 6 (2.6%) were mupirocin resistant. MecA gene was detected in both MupL and MupH strains but MupA gene was only detected in MupH. Plasmid curing improved the plasmidic location of MupA gene. Molecular typing by Eric-PCR method revealed heterogenicity of the genetic make up of our MupL and MupH strains. Staphylococci with MupA-carrying genes are present in Jordanian hospitals, but thank to the limited use of mupirocin, they remain rare.
