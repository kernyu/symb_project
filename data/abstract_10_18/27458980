Donor-derived infections with multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria are associated with poor outcomes, in part because of limited treatment options. Here, we describe a case of donor-derived, disseminated infection with colistin-resistant, carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in a liver transplant recipient that was cured with addition of intravenous fosfomycin to a multidrug regimen, in conjunction with aggressive surgical source control. Intravenous fosfomycin represents a promising adjunctive agent for use in treatment of extensively drug-resistant infections in immunocompromised hosts.
