Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection with its vast prevalence is responsible for various gastric diseases including gastritis, peptic ulcers, and gastric malignancy. While effective, current treatment regimens are challenged by a fast-declining eradication rate due to the increasing emergence of H. pylori strains resistant to existing antibiotics. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel antibacterial strategies against H. pylori. In this study, we developed a liposomal nanoformulation of linolenic acid (LipoLLA) and evaluated its bactericidal activity against resistant strains of H. pylori. Using a laboratory strain of H. pylori, we found that LipoLLA was effective in killing both spiral and coccoid forms of the bacteria via disrupting bacterial membranes. Using a metronidazole-resistant strain of H. pylori and seven clinically isolated strains, we further demonstrated that LipoLLA eradicated all strains of the bacteria regardless of their antibiotic resistance status. Furthermore, under our experimental conditions, the bacteria did not develop drug resistance when cultured with LipoLLA at various sub-bactericidal concentrations, whereas they rapidly acquired resistance to both metronidazole and free linolenic acid (LLA). Our findings suggest that LipoLLA is a promising antibacterial nanotherapeutic to treat antibiotic-resistant H. pylori infection.
