Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are naturally produced antibiotics that play important roles in host defense mechanisms. These proteins are found in variety of animal and plant species. The antibiotic effects of AMPs are gaining attention for use in human medicine. In this study, the antimicrobial effects of coprisin, a novel AMP isolated from the dung beetle (Copris tripartitus), were evaluated. The peptide was used to treat rats with wounds infected with Staphylococcus aureus. Coprisin accelerated wound closure both grossly and microscopically compared with the untreated group. Additionally, treatment with this peptide decreased phosphorylated-Smad2/3 (p-Smad2/3) levels, a downstream factor of the transforming growth factor-beta signaling pathway which is believed to inhibit reepithelization, in the nucleus and cytoplasm of regenerating cells. Moreover, increased cell populations and angiogenesis were observed in lesions treated with coprisin, suggesting that this peptide promotes wound healing via its antimicrobial activity against S. aureus. Our results demonstrated that coprisin is a potential therapeutic agent that can possibly replace traditional antibiotics and overcome microbial resistance.
