Novel arylethynyltriazole acyclonucleosides were synthesized and assessed for their anticancer activity on drug-resistant pancreatic cancer MiaPaCa-2 cells. One lead compound was found to have much more potent apoptosis-related antiproliferative effects than gemcitabine, the current first-line treatment for pancreatic cancer. Further investigations showed that this active compound did not inhibit DNA synthesis, which means that it does not resemble gemcitabine and may involve a different mechanism of action.
