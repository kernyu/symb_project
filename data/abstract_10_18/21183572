Manganese has an important yet undefined role in the virulence of many bacterial pathogens. In this study we confirm that a null mutation in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis mntH reduces intracellular manganese accumulation. An mntH mutant was susceptible to killing by reactive oxygen species when grown under manganese-limited conditions. The mntH mutant was defective in survival and growth in macrophages expressing functional Nramp1, but in macrophages deficient in Nramp the bacteria were able to survive and replicate. In Galleria mellonella, the mntH mutant was attenuated. Taken together, these data suggest a role for manganese in Y. pseudotuberculosis during macrophage intracellular survival, protecting the bacteria from the antimicrobial products released during the respiratory burst.
