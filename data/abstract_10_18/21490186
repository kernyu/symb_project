Clavispora lusitaniae is an opportunistic human pathogen responsible for 0.6 to 2% of candidemia. This species is intrinsically susceptible to echinocandins. Nevertheless, in this study, development of echinocandin resistance in C. lusitaniae isolates was observed during caspofungin treatment. This resistance resulted from missense mutation in the echinocandin target Fks1 gene.
