BACKGROUND AND AIM: Effective and safe antiviral treatment regimens are needed for patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and cirrhosis. METHODS: An international open-label trial was conducted in CHC patients with genotype (G)1/4 infection, compensated cirrhosis, HCV RNA >/= 50,000 IU/mL and body mass index 18-35 kg/m(2). Treatment-naive patients (Cohort 1) received a triple therapy regimen [danoprevir/r 100/100 mg twice daily (bid), ribavirin 1000/1200 mg/day and peginterferon alfa-2a 180 microg/week] for 24 weeks. Prior null responders (Cohort 2) received a quadruple therapy regimen (danoprevir/r 100/100 mg bid, mericitabine 1000 mg bid and peginterferon alfa-2a/ribavirin). The primary efficacy outcome was sustained virological response (HCV RNA < limit of quantification, target not detected) at end of the 24-week follow-up period (SVR24). RESULTS: In Cohort 1 (n = 23), 73.9 and 65.2 % of patients had a virological response at Weeks 4 and 24, respectively; 39.1 % achieved SVR24 (G1a = 1/13; G1b = 8/9; G4 = 0/1). In Cohort 2 (n = 20), 100 % achieved virological response at Weeks 4 and 24; 65 % achieved SVR24 (G1a = 4/8; G1b = 7/10; G4 = 2/2). Treatment failure was more common in G1a than G1b-infected patients and less common in patients receiving quadruple therapy. Treatment failure was associated with emergence of resistance to danoprevir, but not mericitabine. The safety profile was typical of that associated with peginterferon alfa-2a/ribavirin. No deaths/episodes of hepatic decompensation occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with danoprevir/r-based regimens for 24 weeks is safe and well tolerated in CHC patients with compensated cirrhosis. A quadruple therapy regimen (danoprevir/r, mericitabine, peginterferon alfa/ribavirin) produced high SVR24 rates in prior null responders, particularly among G1b patients.
