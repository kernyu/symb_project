BACKGROUND: Data on the use of ritonavir-boosted darunavir (DRV/r) and/or raltegravir (RAL) in resource-limited settings are rare and there is currently no published data regarding their use among African children. Botswana has recently made DRV/r and RAL available for patients failing second-line antiretroviral therapy (ART). METHODS: Retrospective chart review of 4 multidrug-resistant pediatric patients on DRV/r- and/or RAL-based regimens. Viral load, CD4 count, adherence by pill count, and World Health Organization (WHO) clinical stage prior to and after switch to DRV/r- and/or RAL-based regimen were assessed. Antiretroviral therapy history, duration of virologic failure, and time to viral suppression were also noted. Genotypic resistance assays reviewed for mutations present prior to switch. RESULTS: All patients achieved viral suppression, showed improved/stable CD4 counts, and obtained or maintained WHO clinical treatment stage I, even after long-standing virologic/immunologic failure. CONCLUSIONS: Well tolerated by and effective in our patients, DRV/r and RAL provide potentially lifesaving ART options for children and adolescents in resource-limited settings failing ART due to ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r) resistance.
