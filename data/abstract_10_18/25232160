The emergence of azole-resistant strains of Aspergillus fumigatus during treatment for aspergillosis occurs by a mutation selection process. Understanding how antifungal resistance mechanisms evolve in the host environment during infection is of great clinical importance and biological interest. Here, we used next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify mutations that arose during infection by A. fumigatus strains sequentially isolated from two patients, one with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) (five isolations) and the other with aspergilloma (three isolations). The serial isolates had identical microsatellite types, but their growth rates and conidia production levels were dissimilar. A whole-genome comparison showed that three of the five isolates from the IPA patient carried a mutation, while 22 mutations, including six nonsynonymous ones, were found among three isolates from the aspergilloma patient. One aspergilloma isolate carried the cyp51A mutation P216L, which is reported to confer azole resistance, and it displayed an MIC indicating resistance to itraconazole. This isolate harbored five other nonsynonymous mutations, some of which were found in the afyap1 and aldA genes. We further identified a large deletion in the aspergilloma isolate in a region containing 11 genes. This finding suggested the possibility that genomic deletions can occur during chronic infection with A. fumigatus. Overall, our results revealed dynamic alterations that occur in the A. fumigatus genome within its host during infection and treatment.
