Can we predict the rise and spread of resistance to multi-drug therapy in a more predictable manner? We raise this question after analyzing over 500 Plasmodium vivax isolates collected from different, geographically isolated regions of China for sequence variation in and around the dhfr and dhps genes. We find: that resistance lineages have arisen at least once in each region; that there appears to have been little movement of parasite populations between these areas; and that highly resistant parasites contain dhfr and dhps alleles that are in linkage disequilibrium. We show a direct relationship between this linkage disequilibrium and a parasite's fitness in the absence of drug pressure. Such fitness would increase the spread of drug resistant phenotypes and is thus a selectable trait. These conclusions raise questions about the appropriate use of some other drug combinations to prevent and treat infection.
