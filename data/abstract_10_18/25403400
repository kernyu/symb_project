Drug resistance and viability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were studied in 637 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, detected by screening fluorography (group 1) and in 909 patients in whom the specific process was detected when they applied for medical care (group 2). The mycobacteria in the two groups did not differ by the incidence, type, and spectra of drug resistance. The percentage of mycobacteria with high viability was 2-fold higher in group 2, which explains the more severe clinical structure and characteristics of the specific process in these patients.
