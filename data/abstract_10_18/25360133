Bacteriophage lysins, the highly evolved specific peptidoglycan hydrolases, have long been demonstrated to be effective enzybiotics in various infectious models. The modular structure of lysins makes it possible to design bioengineered lysins that have desired properties, such as higher activity, or broader killing spectrum. Moreover, lysins can even be engineered to kill Gram-negative bacterial pathogens from without, a property that is not present in natural lysins. In this era of ever increasing multidrug resistant pathogens, engineered lysins represent a new class of enzybiotics that are powerful and readily available to fight antimicrobial resistance.
