Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) accounts for approximately 40% of staphylococcal infections in China. However, the molecular characterization of MSSA is not well described. In this study, 124 MSSA strains collected in 2013 from a comprehensive teaching hospital in Chongqing, Southwestern China, were subjected to antibiotics susceptibility testing and molecular typing, including multilocus sequence typing, staphylococcal protein A (spa) gene typing, accessory gene regulator (agr) typing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing, Panton-Valentine leukocidin (pvl) gene detection, and antibiotic-resistant gene detection. MSSA strains exhibited high genetic heterogeneity. A total of 10 PFGE groups, 26 sequence types, and 47 spa types were identified. Type I (62.9%) was the most frequent agr type, followed by type II (15.3%), type IV (11.3%), and type III (10.5%). The prevalence of pvl genes was 27.4% (34/124). Notably, 44.4% (55/124) of MSSA strains were multidrug resistance (MDR), and MDR isolates were mostly resistant to penicillin, erythromycin, and clindamycin. The resistance gene blaZ was present in 84.7% of strains, ermC was present in 85.5% of strains, ermA was present in 28.2% of strains, tetK was present in 16.1% of strains, tetM was present in 6.5% of strains, and aacA-aphD was present in 2.6% of strains. These data demonstrated the high prevalence of MDR MSSA in Chongqing, thereby indicating the need to control MSSA infection.
