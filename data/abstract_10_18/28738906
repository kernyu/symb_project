Next-generation sequencing is increasingly being used to monitor current and historic events related to the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance. In a recent publication, researchers analyzed the rise of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the 1960s, emphasizing that adaptations conferring antibiotic resistance might pre-date the introduction of novel antibiotic derivatives. Other researchers have evaluated the role of transmission within a healthcare network, using the example of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-resistant Escherichia coli.Please see related Genome Biology Research article: www.dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13059-017-1252-9 and Genome Medicine Research article: www.dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13073-017-0457-6.
