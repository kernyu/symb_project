Around 50% of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive patients infected with genotype 1 are nonresponders to the combination of pegylated interferon (pegIFN) and ribavirin, including relapsers, and partial and null responders and, as such, are exposed to the risk of progression to cirrhosis and its complications, resulting in HCV-related morbidity and mortality. Repeat treatment using the same combination in such patients results in <5% viral eradication and there are no therapeutic prospects for patients who fail, as maintenance therapy has not proved efficacious. The triple association of direct-acting antivirals specific of HCV, and especially the first-generation protease inhibitors boceprevir and telaprevir, increases this percentage to around 65%, with variations according to the previous response to therapy of patients (85% of relapsers, 50% of partial responders and 30% of null responders). These encouraging results extend the therapeutic indications and costs of therapy during virological follow-up, and influence the rules of discontinuation. Information on the management of these new molecules also allows a larger number of patients to be cured and reduces the occurrence of viral resistance. Thus, the aim of the present review is to summarize the efficacy of the triple association of pegIFN, ribavirin and telaprevir or boceprevir in treatment-experienced patients who failed to respond to dual pegIFN and ribavirin therapy.
