In the present study, the fruiting body extracts of Xylaria sp. strain R006 were obtained from hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol. Among them, the ethyl acetate extract exhibited significant antimicrobial activities against bacterial and fungal pathogens. Based on the effective antimicrobial activity, the crude ethyl acetate extract was fractionized by two-step siliga gel column chromatography. All the fractions were tested for antibacterial activity against drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains (1-10) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains (1-8). The fraction E showed a maximum inhibition zone of 27.9 mm against drug resistant S. aureus strain 3 and 29.4 mm against drug resistant P. aeruginosa strain 4. Minimal inhibitory concentration of fraction E showed potential result against all the drug resistant strains however, the lowest concentration of 75 microg/mL-1 was observed against S. aureus strains 1 and 6 and P. aeruginosa strain 3. Further, 60 microg/mL of fraction E had significant cytotoxic activity of 54.9, 55.1 and 54.9% against MDA-MB-231 (breast carcinoma cells), A-549 (lung carcinoma cells) and MCF-7 (breast carcinoma cells) human cancer cell lines, respectively. The spectral data revealed that the fraction E has chromophoric groups in it and had the C = O stretching, C-C = C asymmetric stretch, N-H stretch and C-O stretch as functional groups. The results indicate that the metabolites of fruiting bodies of Xylaria sp. R006 are the potential natural source for the development of new anticancer agents.
