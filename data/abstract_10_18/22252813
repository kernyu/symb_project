This study examines in vitro antimicrobial resistance data from Escherichia coli isolates obtained from urine samples of U.S. outpatients between 2000 and 2010 using The Surveillance Network (TSN). Antimicrobial susceptibility results (n = 12,253,679) showed the greatest increases in E. coli resistance from 2000 to 2010 for ciprofloxacin (3% to 17.1%) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) (17.9% to 24.2%), whereas nitrofurantoin (0.8% to 1.6%) and ceftriaxone (0.2% to 2.3%) showed minimal change. From 2000 to 2010, the antimicrobial resistance of urinary E. coli isolates to ciprofloxacin and TMP-SMX among outpatients increased substantially.
