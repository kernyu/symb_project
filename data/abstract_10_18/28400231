Chemical investigations of the MeOH extract of air dried flowers of the Australian tree Angophora woodsiana (Myrtaceae) yielded two new beta-triketones, woodsianones A and B (1, 2) and nine known beta-triketones (3-11). Woodsianone A is a beta-triketone-sesquiterpene adduct and woodsianone B is a beta-triketone epoxide derivative. The structures of the new and known compounds were elucidated from the analysis of 1D/2D NMR and MS data. The relative configurations of the compounds were determined from analysis of (1)H-(1)H coupling constants and ROESY correlations. All compounds (1-11) had antiplasmodial activity against the chloroquine sensitive strain 3D7. The known compound rhodomyrtone (5) and new compound woodsianone B (2) showed moderate antiplasmodial activities against the 3D7 strain (1.84microM and 3.00microM, respectively) and chloroquine resistant strain Dd2 (4.00microM and 2.53microM, respectively).
