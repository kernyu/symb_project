The antibiotic resistance phenotype and genotype and the integron type were characterized in 58 Salmonella enterica isolates recovered from Bisaro pigs and wild boars (20 S. Typhimurium, 17 S. Rissen, 14 S. Enteritidis and 7 S. Havana). Most S. Typhimurium isolates (15/20 of Bisaro pigs and wild boars) showed ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, tetracycline, sulfonamide, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid resistances. Of the 17 S. Rissen isolates of both origins, 13 were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Among the S. Enteritidis isolates of Bisaro pigs, eight were nalidixic acid-resistant and three were sulfonamide-resistant. The tet(A) or tet(G) genes were detected in most tetracycline-resistant isolates. The intI1 gene was identified in 72.5% of S. enterica isolates in which the conserved region 3' of class 1 integrons (qacEDelta1+sul1) was also amplified, whereas none had the intI2 gene. The dfrA12+orfF+aadA2 gene cassette arrangement was found in the variable region of class 1 integrons in 14 S. Rissen isolates. Fifteen S. Typhimurium isolates had two integrons with variable regions of 1000 and 1200 bp that harbored the aadA2 and blaPSE-1 gene cassettes, respectively. In these isolates the floR and tet(G) genes were also amplified, indicative of the genomic island 1 (SGI1). Salmonella Typhimurium and S. Rissen of animal origin frequently show a multi-antimicrobial resistant phenotype, which may have implications in public health.
