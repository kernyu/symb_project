The influenza virus neuraminidase inhibitors are normally slow binding inhibitors, but many mutations leading to resistance, also result in the loss of the slow binding phenotype. Mutations can also affect the rate of dissociation of the inhibitors from the neuraminidase, but the assays to measure this require large amounts of virus and are time consuming. To more fully understand the impacts of mutations on the binding and dissociation of the neuraminidase inhibitors we have developed a solid phase reactivation assay, which can use small amounts of crude virus sample bound to an ELISA plate. Multiple viruses can be assayed simultaneously against multiple inhibitors. Using this assay we have demonstrated differences in the relative rates of dissociation of the inhibitors and reactivation of enzyme activity among different influenza A and B viruses for zanamivir, oseltamivir and peramivir. In general oseltamivir dissociated the fastest, and dissociation of peramivir was much slower than both the other inhibitors. Viruses with H274Y, E119V and E119G mutations demonstrated faster dissociation of the inhibitor to which they were resistant. Dissociation of zanamivir and oseltamivir were faster from the D197E mutant, but not of peramivir.
