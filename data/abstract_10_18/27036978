Cross-resistance in rifamycins has been observed in rifampin (RIF)-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates; some rpoB mutations do not confer broad in vitro rifamycin resistance. We examined 164 isolates, of which 102 were RIF-resistant, for differential resistance between RIF and rifabutin (RFB). A total of 42 unique single mutations or combinations of mutations were detected. The number of unique mutations identified exceeded that reported in any previous study. RFB and RIF MICs up to 8 mug/mL by MGIT 960 were studied; the cut-off values for susceptibility to RIF and RFB were 1 mug/mL and 0.5 mug/mL, respectively. We identified 31 isolates resistant to RIF but susceptible to RFB with the mutations D516V, D516F, 518 deletion, S522L, H526A, H526C, H526G, H526L, and two dual mutations (S522L + K527R and H526S + K527R). Clinical investigations using RFB to treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis cases harboring those mutations are recommended.
