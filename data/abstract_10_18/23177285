Monotherapy is an ineffective way to treat hepatitis C and it leads to rapid development of resistance. An increasing number of drugs are currently being developed for the treatment of hepatitis C. This allows combination strategies that can overcome the development of resistance and improve sustained virologic response rates. This article focuses on the 2 main strategies in development: quadruple combination therapies, including pegylated-interferon and triple/quadruple pegylated-interferon free combination therapies. If the first combinations are leading to extremely high sustained virologic responses, the second ones offer hope that the era of pegylated-interferon will end soon.
