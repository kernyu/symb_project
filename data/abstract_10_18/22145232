Clinical and immunological parameters in the children with perinatal HIV infection were investigated in the dynamics of the long-term prospective observation. It was revealed, that all the HIV infected children had clinical signs of immunodeficiency and laboratory signs of combined damage of the immune system. The complex of therapeutic measures, including antiretroviral therapy, prevention of opportunistic and acute respiratory infections, rational immunotherapy to stimulate production of endogenous interferon and normalization of the balance of cytokines significantly reduced the frequency of the clinical manifestations of the infectious syndrome and improved the patients resistance to infections.
