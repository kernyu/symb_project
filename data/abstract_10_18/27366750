Majority of gram negative pathogenic bacteria are responsible for extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) production, which show resistance to some newer generation of antibiotics. The study was aimed at evaluating the prevalence of ESBL and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of Pseudomonas isolates collected during 2010 to 2014 from tertiary care hospitals of Peshawar, Pakistan. Out of 3450 samples, 334 Pseudomonas spp. isolates comprised of 232 indoor and 102 outdoor patients were obtained from different specimens and their susceptibility pattern was determined against 20 antibiotics. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out using the Kirby-Bauer agar diffusion method and ESBL production was detected by Synergy Disc Diffusion technique. The mean age group of the patients was 29.9 + 9.15 years. Meronem showed best activity (91.02%) from class carbapenem, beta-lactam and beta-lactamase inhibitors exhibited 69.16% activity, and doxycycline had a diminished activity (10.18%) to Pseudomonas spp. Outdoor isolates were more resistant than the indoor and during the course of the study the sensitivity rate of antibiotics was gradually reducing. ESBL production was observed in 44.32% while the remaining was non-ESBL. The moderate active antibiotics were amikacin (50.7%), SCF (51.4%), TZP (52.7%), and MXF (54.1%) among ESBL producing isolates. Lack of antibiotic policy, irrational uses (3GCs particularly), and the emergence of antibiotic resistant organisms in hospitals may be causes of high antibiotic resistance.
