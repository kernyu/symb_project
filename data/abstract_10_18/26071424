OBJECTIVES: An outbreak of diarrhoea involving 16 cats at a cattery in Norway was investigated. Treatment and control of the outbreak were the primary objectives, but the effects of treatment on the antimicrobial resistance profiles of Escherichia coli isolated from faeces were also investigated. METHODS: Faecal samples were investigated for Giardia cysts by immunofluorescence microscopy, and multi-locus genotyping was performed to determine the Giardia genotype. Faecal E coli were assessed, before and after treatment for giardiasis, for antimicrobial resistance. RESULTS: The outbreak was probably caused by Giardia duodenalis, Assemblage F. Although infection was eliminated in most cats following treatment with fenbendazole, over 30% of the infected cats required a second treatment round (combined fenbendazole and metronidazole). Investigation of sensitivity to antibacterial drugs of E coli that had been isolated both prior to and following treatment demonstrated that fenbendazole treatment may select for resistant bacteria. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Controlling Giardia infections in dense cat populations can be challenging, and requires strict hygiene measures. In cases where fenbendazole alone does not result in treatment success, a combination treatment with fenbendazole and metronidazole may be effective. Although this study did not include untreated controls, we suggest that the potential for changes in gut microbiota and antimicrobial resistance development should be considered when choosing antiprotozoal drugs, particularly in cases of treatment failure and where repeat treatment is required.
