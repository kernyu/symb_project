Recognition of the cytoprotective functions of autophagy that occur in tumor cells exposed to various forms of chemotherapy or radiation has generated intense interest in the possibility that pharmacological interference with autophagy could provide a clinical strategy for overcoming therapeutic resistance. Multiple clinical trials are currently in progress to evaluate the antimalarial agent chloroquine (generally in its clinical formulation as hydroxychloroquine) and its impact on various forms of cancer therapy. In this commentary/review, we focus on the relatively limited number of studies in the literature where chloroquine has been tested in combination with chemotherapy or radiation in experimental tumor-bearing animal models. We also present recent data from our own laboratories, in cell culture experiments as well as in vivo studies, which demonstrate that neither chloroquine nor silencing of an autophagy regulatory gene was effective in conferring radiation sensitivity in an experimental model of breast cancer. The capacity for sensitization by chloroquine appears to be quite wide-ranging, with dramatic effects for some drugs/tumor models and modest or minimal effects in others. One possible caveat is that, with only a few exceptions, experiments have generally been performed in xenograft models, thereby eliminating the involvement of the immune system, which might ultimately be proven to play a central role in determining the effectiveness of autophagy inhibition in chemosensitization or radiosensitization. Nevertheless, a careful review of the current literature suggests that caution is likely to be warranted in translating preclinical findings relating to autophagy inhibition as an adjunctive therapeutic strategy.
