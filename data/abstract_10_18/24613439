One-third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Data reported in 2011 indicate, for the first time, a decline in cases of tuberculosis, despite persistent inequalities across geographic areas and increasing rates of drug resistance. Osteo-articular tuberculosis affects the spine in half the cases. Pharmacotherapy must be combined with surgery in patients with spinal cord or nerve root compression, large abscesses, or marked anterior column osteolysis with kyphosis and instability. The quality of debridement and bony fusion is optimal when the anterior approach is used. Posterior fixation is the best means of achieving reduction followed by stable sagittal alignment over time. New treatment strategies combine conventional surgical methods, closed interventional radiology procedures for drainage and spinal cord decompression, and percutaneous fixation.
