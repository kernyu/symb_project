The objective of the present study was to analyse the in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of Streptococcus suis isolates from post-mortem samples from pigs in the Netherlands. S. suis isolates originated from diagnostic submissions of pigs sent to the Pathology Department of GD Animal Health, from April 2013 till June 2015. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of in total 15 antimicrobials were assessed by broth microdilution following CLSI recommendations. MIC50 and MIC90 values were determined and MICs were interpreted as susceptible, intermediate and resistant using CLSI veterinary breakpoints (when available). Emergence of resistance among S. suis (n=1163) derived from clinical submissions of pigs appeared to be limited. Resistance to ampicillin, ceftiofur, clindamycin, enrofloxacin, florfenicol, penicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline was 0.3%, 0.5%, 48.1%, 0.6%, 0.1%, 0.5%, 3.0%, and 78.4%, respectively. Cross-resistance between penicillin and ampicillin appeared to be incomplete. MIC values of erythromycin, clindamycin, neomycin, penicillin and tilmicosin for isolates originating from grower/finisher pigs were significantly more often lower than the MIC values of isolates from suckling/weaned piglets. It has to be kept in mind that these results represent only part of the Dutch pig population and it can be discussed whether this is a representative sample. Interpretation of the MIC results of (clinically relevant) antimicrobials tested for treatment of S. suis infection is strongly hampered by the lack of CLSI-defined veterinary clinical breakpoints that are animal species- and body site-specific. Therefore, and to conduct a clinically reliable monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibility of veterinary pathogens, more species- and organ-specific veterinary breakpoints are urgently needed.
