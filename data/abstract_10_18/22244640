INTRODUCTION: This study aimed at evaluating the bond strength to root dentin of 2 mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA)-based sealers (Endo-CPM sealer and MTA Fillapex) and of 1 epoxy resin-based sealer (AH Plus sealer). METHODS: Forty-five extracted human teeth with single roots were prepared by using the step-back technique. Irrigation with 2.5% NaOCl and a final rinse with 17% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and distilled water were performed. Canals were filled by using Endo-CPM sealer, MTA Fillapex, or AH Plus sealer by means of the gutta-percha lateral condensation technique. After 7 days, the roots were sectioned perpendicularly to its long axis, and the push-out test was carried out. The data were analyzed by using the Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn post hoc tests. RESULTS: Endo-CPM sealer showed the highest values of bond strength to root dentin (8.265 MPa) (P < .05). The values of push-out test were similar for MTA Fillapex (2.041 MPa) and AH Plus (3.034 MPa). CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the findings presented herein and within the limitations of this study, Endo-CPM sealer presented advantages when a post preparation was required. MTA Fillapex presented acceptable resistance to dislodgement, which was similar to that observed in samples filled with AH Plus sealer.
