Thirty Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Hadar isolates of avian origin collected between 2007 and 2010 from chicken carcasses in five geographically spread abattoirs in Germany were investigated for plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants. Four isolates were identified by PCR analysis and hybridization experiments to carry qnrB genes. The isolates were indistinguishable by their XbaI macrorestriction patterns and did not exhibit a mutation in the quinolone resistance-determining regions of the DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV genes. The qnrB genes were found to be located on small plasmids of approximately 2.6 kb, which mediated decreased susceptibility only to quinolones. The plasmids were assigned to the same type, pHAD28, and transformation studies into an Escherichia coli recipient strain confirmed their transferability. Sequence analysis of the complete plasmid pHAD28 revealed the presence of a qnrB19 gene. The gene was found on a novel variant of qnrB19-harboring plasmids with high similarity to plasmids pPAB19-3 from E. coli and pPAB19-4 from Salmonella sp. M9397. A presumptive recombination side was detected, suggesting that interplasmid recombination events might have played a role in the development of this plasmid variant.
