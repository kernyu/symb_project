Outbreaks by carbapenem-resistant Providencia stuartii (CRPS) are rarely described. Clinical characteristics of patients with CRPS in an intensive care unit and resistance mechanisms were investigated. Carbapenemase production and/or outer membrane alterations were not detected; only CTX-M-2 and AmpC hyperproduction were noted. The outbreak was ultimately controlled in a 3-month period.
