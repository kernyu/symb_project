The efficacies of many antimicrobial peptides are greatly reduced in the presence of high salt concentrations therefore limiting their development as pharmaceutical compounds. PEM-2-W5K/A9W, a short Trp-rich antimicrobial peptide developed based on the structural studies of PEM-2, has been shown to be highly active against various bacterial strains with less hemolytic activity. Here, correlations between membrane immersion depth, orientation, and salt-resistance of PEM-2 and PEM-2-W5K/A9W have been investigated via solution structure and paramagnetic resonance enhancement studies. The antimicrobial activities of PEM-2-W5K/A9W and PEM-2 against various bacterial and fungal strains including multidrug-resistant and clinical isolates under high salt conditions were tested. The activities of the salt-sensitive peptide PEM-2 were reduced and diminished at high salt concentrations, whereas the activities of PEM-2-W5K/A9W were less affected. The results indicated that the strong salt-resistance of PEM-2-W5K/A9W may arise from the peptide positioning itself deeply into microbial cell membranes and thus able to disrupt the membranes more efficiently.
