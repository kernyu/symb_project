The activity of macrolides and other antimicrobials was evaluated by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute reference broth microdilution methods for Moraxella catarrhalis isolates collected during 2009-2011. In Europe, the United States, and Latin America, M. catarrhalis resistance to macrolides and tetracycline was <1%. However, in the Asia-Pacific region, clarithromycin and tetracycline resistance was 7.6% and 3.2%, respectively. The higher resistance rate in the Asia-Pacific region to clarithromycin and tetracycline was primarily due to isolates from multiple locations in China.
