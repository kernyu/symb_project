Acinetobacter species show high levels of intrinsic resistance to many antibiotics. The major protein species in the outer membrane of Acinetobacter baumannii does not belong to the high-permeability trimeric porin family, which includes Escherichia coli OmpF/OmpC, and instead is a close homolog of E. coli OmpA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa OprF. We characterized the pore-forming function of this OmpA homolog, OmpA(Ab), by a reconstitution assay. OmpA(Ab) produced very low pore-forming activity, about 70-fold lower than that of OmpF and an activity similar to that of E. coli OmpA and P. aeruginosa OprF. The pore size of the OmpA(Ab) channel was similar to that of OprF, i.e., about 2 nm in diameter. The low permeability of OmpA(Ab) is not due to the inactivation of this protein during purification, because the permeability of the whole A. baumannii outer membrane was also very low. Furthermore, the outer membrane permeability to cephalothin and cephaloridine, measured in intact cells, was about 100-fold lower than that of E. coli K-12. The permeability of cephalothin and cephaloridine in A. baumannii was decreased 2- to 3-fold when the ompA(Ab) gene was deleted. These results show that OmpA(Ab) is the major nonspecific channel in A. baumannii. The low permeability of this porin, together with the presence of constitutive beta-lactamases and multidrug efflux pumps, such as AdeABC and AdeIJK, appears to be essential for the high levels of intrinsic resistance to a number of antibiotics.
