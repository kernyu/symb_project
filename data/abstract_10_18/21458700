The alarms that have sounded in the last two decades of the 20(th) century in the feld of antimicrobial resistance in livestock farming have led to the development of various measures that have substantially improved the use of antimicrobial agents in veterinary medicine. These measures mainly involve the implementation of new pharmaceutical legislation and the hygiene package provisions. Even though awareness of the regulations is high, surveillance systems have been implemented and the promotion of appropriate use has begun to show results, it is necessary to maintain these measures while promoting alternatives to the use of antimicrobials. In particular, alternatives are needed for those agents used for prevention of bacterial diseases, either specifically, through vaccination and improvement of biosafety (use of insecticides, disinfectants and insect repellents), or generally by improving farm facilities and animal welfare. All of these alternatives would reduce the need to use antimicrobial agents in animals. These actions should be complemented by training for all those players involved (veterinarians, farmers, the pharmaceutical industry, veterinary medicines suppliers and food retailers), and by establishing more effective cooperation between human and veterinary medicine.
