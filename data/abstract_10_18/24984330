Currently, therapy for hepatitis B has a limited effect and can rarely eradicate infection (ALT normalization, undetectable HBV DNA, HBsAg/anti-HBs seroconversion). Minimal progress in terms of treatment success has been achieved in the past four years. Changes from the previous Croatian Consensus Conferences in 2005 and 2009 are based on standings of the Consensus Conference of the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) 2009, Consensus Conference of the European Association for the Study of Liver (EASL) 2012, and Asia-Pacific Association Guidelines for the Study of Liver (APASL) 2012. In this paper, we will mention only differences in relation to the before mentioned Croatian guidelines from 2005 and 2009. New developments relating to the application of noninvasive methods for assessing fibrosis, quantification of HBsAg to predict treatment outcome, registration of new drugs, and some new recommendations for more efficient and rational treatment will be reviewed. New findings as well as recommendations for the treatment of patients in special circumstances including treatment of pregnant women, patients with drug resistance, patients with co-infection, hepatic decompensation, patients on immune and chemotherapy, patients after liver transplantation, and patients with HCC will also be included.
