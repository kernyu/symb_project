In this study, the prevalence of gram-positive cocci isolates and the characteristics of multiple drug resistances in patients were investigated. Antibiotic resistances were determined in the clinical microbiology laboratory with the methodology of the CLSI (2012). The software WHONET5.4 and SPSS13.0 were used for statistical analysis. There were a total of 6211 gram-positive cocci isolates, comprised of 2255 (36.3%) coagulase (-) staphylococci, 1277 (20.6%) staphylococci aureus, 1109 (17.9%) enterococcus faecalis, and 1045 (16.8%) enterococcus faecium. The proportion of Methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was 16.6% (212/1277). Methicillin resistant coagulase (-) staphylococci (MRCNS) was 14.1% (318/2255). There were no strains in isolated enterococci resistant to vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid. Among the majority of all monitored antibiotics, methicillin resistant staphylococci has much higher drug resistance rate than methicillin sensitive staphylococci (p<0.05). Enterococcus faecalis has higher multiple drug resistant rate than enterococcus faecium (p<0.01). This research may support the clinicians in prescribing antibiotics properly.
