ADEP, a molecule of the acyl depsipeptide family, has an antibiotic activity with a unique mode of action. ADEP binding to the ubiquitous protease ClpP alters the structure of the enzyme. Access of protein to the ClpP proteolytic chamber is therefore facilitated and its cohort regulatory ATPases (ClpA, ClpC, ClpX) are not required. The consequent uncontrolled protein degradation in the cell appears to kill the ADEP-treated bacteria. ADEP is produced by Streptomyces hawaiiensis. Most sequenced genomes of Streptomyces have five clpP genes, organized as two distinct bicistronic operons, clpP1clpP2 and clpP3clpP4, and a single clpP5 gene. We investigated whether the different Clp proteases are all sensitive to ADEP. We report that ClpP1 is a target of ADEP whereas ClpP3 is largely insensitive. In wild-type Streptomyces lividans, clpP3clpP4 expression is constitutively repressed and the reason for the maintenance of this operon in Streptomyces has been elusive. ClpP activity is indispensable for survival of actinomycetes; we therefore tested whether the clpP3clpP4 operon, encoding an ADEP-insensitive Clp protease, contributes to a mechanism of ADEP resistance by target substitution. We report that in S. lividans, inactivation of ClpP1ClpP2 production or protease activity is indeed a mode of resistance to ADEP although it is neither the only nor the most frequent mode of resistance. The ABC transporter SclAB (orthologous to the Streptomyces coelicolor multidrug resistance pump SCO4959-SCO4960) is also able to confer ADEP resistance, and analysis of strains with sclAB deletions indicates that there are also other mechanisms of ADEP resistance.
