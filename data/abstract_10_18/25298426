Vascular aging has been implicated in the progression of diabetes and age-related cardiovascular disorders. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone capable of cytoprotective actions in addition to its glucose-lowering effect. The present study was undertaken to examine whether Exendin-4, a specific ligand for the GLP-1 receptor, could prevent angiotensin (ANG) II-induced premature senescence in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and to determine the underlying mechanism involved. Senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA beta-gal) assay showed that ANG II induced premature senescence of VSMCs. Pretreatment with Exendin-4 significantly attenuated ANG II-induced generation of H2O2 and the subsequent VSMC senescence. These effects were, however, reversed in the presence of exendin fragment 9-39, a GLP-1 receptor antagonist, or PKI14-22. Moreover, a marked increase in the levels of p53 and p21 induced by ANG II was blunted by the treatment with Exendin-4. Nevertheless, Exendin-4 failed to decrease ANG II-induced expression of NAD(P)H oxidase 1 (Nox1), NAD(P)H oxidase 4 (Nox4), p22(phox), or p47(phox) in VSMCs. Mechanistically, Exendin-4 blocked ANG II-induced Rac1 activation through the cAMP/PKA signaling cascade. Specifically, NSC23766, a Rac1 inhibitor, abrogated the suppressive effects of Exendin-4 on ANG II-induced premature senescence and H2O2 generation, respectively. Thus Exendin-4 confers resistance to ANG II-induced superoxide anion generation from NAD(P)H oxidase and the resultant VSMC senescence by inhibiting Rac1 activation via a cAMP/PKA-dependent pathway. These findings demonstrate that GLP-1 as well as its analogs (GLP-1-related reagents) may hold therapeutic potential in the treatment of diabetes with cardiovascular disease.
