Resistance in Escherichia coli isolates colonizing gastrointestinal tracts of dogs, cats, and their owners in Northern Kenya was investigated with an emphasis on extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). Totals of 47 (22%, n = 216), 2 (4%, n = 50), and 4 (17%, n = 23) CTX-M-15-producing E. coli isolates were obtained from dogs, cats, and humans, respectively. CTX-M-15-producing E. coli isolates with identical PFGE profiles were detected in animals and humans living in the same area.
