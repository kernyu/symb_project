BACKGROUND: Reports of Pseudomonas aeruginosa with high antimicrobial resistance have steadily emerged, threatening the utility of a mainstay in antipseudomonal therapy. This study evaluated the antimicrobial activities of various combination therapies against P. aeruginosa with high antimicrobial resistance, including multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa (MDRP) using an in vitro and in vivo study. METHODS: We evaluated 24 combination therapies, including colistin, aztreonam, meropenem, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, amikacin, rifampicin, arbekacin and piperacillin against 15 MDRP isolates detected at Aichi Medical University Hospital with the break-point checkerboard method. Based on the results of the in vitro study, we evaluated antimicrobial activity against highly antimicrobial-resistant P. aeruginosa with an in vivo murine thigh infection model. RESULTS: The combination regimens including colistin and aztreonam showed higher antimicrobial activity against the 15 MDRP isolates. In the in vivo study, the high-dose colistin monotherapy (16 mg/kg every 12 h) achieved greater log10 CFU changes than the normal-dose colistin regimen (8 mg/kg every 12 h) against 5 P. aeruginosa isolates, including 2 MDRP isolates (p < 0.05). Aztreonam monotherapy (400 mg every 8 h) yielded bacterial densities similar to untreated control mice for the MDRP isolate evaluated. The combination therapy with a higher dose of colistin had superior antimicrobial activity against 5 P. aeruginosa with colistin (MIC 0.5 mug/ml) and aztreonam (MIC >/=128 mug/ml) than colistin monotherapy. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that the combination treatment of colistin and aztreonam could be the most useful for treating highly resistant P. aeruginosa with a higher susceptibility to colistin, including MDRP infections.
