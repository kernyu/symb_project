The present study investigated the drug-resistance to the selected antibiotics in Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and beta-haemolytic coagulase-positive staphylococci isolated from pigeons bred in Poland. In the case of E. coli, tetracyclines and amoxicillin were least effective. In the staphylococci, the highest resistance was detected for oxytetracycline and quinolones and 5% were resistant to methicillin. The lowest drug-resistance was reported for Salmonella typhimurium.
