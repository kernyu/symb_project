Gonorrhea may become untreatable, and new treatment options are essential. Verified resistance to spectinomycin is exceedingly rare. However, we describe a high-level spectinomycin-resistant (MIC, >1,024 mug/ml) Neisseria gonorrhoeae strain from Norway with a novel resistance mechanism. The resistance determinant was a deletion of codon 27 (valine) and a K28E alteration in the ribosomal protein 5S. The traditional spectinomycin resistance gene (16S rRNA) was wild type. Despite this exceedingly rare finding, spectinomycin available for treatment of ceftriaxone-resistant urogenital gonorrhea would be very valuable.
