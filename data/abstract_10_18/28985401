Background: The improvement of medical condition requires prolonged hospital stays, which increase the risk of nosocomial bloodstream infections (BSIs). Methods: All nosocomial BSI newborns in two hospitals were included, and the demographic and clinical characteristics of bacteremia patients were obtained from the information systems. Isolates were identified by biochemical assays. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using disk diffusion method. Results: Except for three same risk factors, intubation with mechanical ventilation was a risk factor in Chongqing, while low birth weight was a risk factor in Henan. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the predominant strain in Chongqing, and Escherichia coli was the most prevalent strain in Henan. The resistance rate of gram-negative bacteria in Henan was higher than that of strains in Chongqing. Conclusions: The risk factors and resistance rate of pathogens were different in different areas. Therefore, treatment protocols should be established based on the trends of drug resistance and bacterial spectrum.
