BACKGROUND: Rhinoviruses are important triggers of pulmonary exacerbations and possible contributors to long-term respiratory morbidity in cystic fibrosis (CF), but mechanisms leading to rhinovirus-induced CF exacerbations are poorly understood. It is hypothesised that there is a deficient innate immune response of the airway epithelium towards rhinovirus infection in CF. METHODS: Early innate immune responses towards rhinoviruses (RV-16, major-type and RV-1B, minor-type) in CF and non-CF bronchial epithelial cell lines and primary nasal and bronchial epithelial cells from patients with CF (n=13) and healthy controls (n=24) were studied. RESULTS: Rhinovirus RNA expression and virus release into supernatants was increased more than tenfold in CF cells compared with controls. CF cells expressed up to 1000 times less interferon (IFN) type I (beta) and type III (lambda) mRNA and produced less than half of IFN-beta and IFN-lambda protein compared with controls. In contrast, interleukin 8 production was not impaired, indicating a selective deficiency in the innate antiviral defence system. Deficient IFN production was paralleled by lower expression of IFN-stimulated genes including myxovirus resistance A, 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase, viperin and nitric oxide synthase 2. Addition of exogenous type I and III IFNs, particularly IFN-beta, restored antiviral pathways and virus control in CF cells, underscoring the crucial role of these molecules. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes a novel mechanism to explain the increased susceptibility of patients with CF to rhinovirus infections. A profound impairment of the antiviral early innate response in CF airway epithelial cells was identified, suggesting a potential use of IFNs in the treatment of rhinovirus-induced CF exacerbations.
