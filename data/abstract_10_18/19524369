Resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains to the broad-spectrum cephalosporins may be mediated by the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). These enzymes are encoded by different genes located on either chromosomes or plasmids. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of ESBLs and antimicrobial susceptibilities of P. aeruginosa isolated from burn patients in Tehran, Iran. Antimicrobial susceptibility of 170 isolates to cefpodoxime, aztreonam, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem, meropenem, cefotaxime, levofloxacin, piperacillin-tazobactam and ceftriaxone was determined by disc agar diffusion test. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the genes encoding OXA-10, PER-1 and VEB-1 was also performed. All isolates (100%) were resistant to ceftazidime, cefotaxime, cefepime and aztreonam. Imipenem and meropenem were the most effective anti-pseudomonal agents. The results revealed that 148 (87.05%) of the isolates were multidrug resistant and 67 (39.41%) of the isolates were ESBL positive. Fifty (74.62%), 33 (49.25%) and 21 (31.34%) strains among 67 ESBL-producing strains amplified blaOXA-10, blaPER-1 and blaVEB-1 respectively. In conclusion, the high prevalence of multidrug resistance (87.05%) and production of OXA-10, PER-1 and VEB-1 genes in P. aeruginosa isolates in burn patients confirm that protocols considering these issues should be considered in burn hospitals.
