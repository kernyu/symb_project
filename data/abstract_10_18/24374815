In order to assess the prevalence of carbapenem-hydrolyzing class D beta-lactamase genes in Acinetobacter spp. isolates in China, we conducted a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based surveillance of OXA-type beta-lactamase gene clusters for a total of 2,880 Acinetobacter spp. isolates collected from 23 Chinese provinces. All isolates were tested for susceptibility to 12 antimicrobial agents and showed high rates of resistance to all these agents except minocycline. We also found that the vast majority of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. were OXA-23-like-producing isolates, predominantly Acinetobacter baumannii isolates. Besides, bla OXA-58-like and bla OXA-24-like genes were detected in 32 and 11 isolates, respectively, involving many provinces throughout China. Furthermore, these two carbapenem-resistance determinants were located on transferable plasmids in most cases, indicating an emerging threat for both OXA-58-like- and OXA-24-like-producing Acinetobacter spp. isolates in China. Interestingly, a novel homologue of the bla OXA-143 gene was identified in a susceptible Acinetobacter pittii isolate. Overall, these observations suggest that the bla OXA-23-harboring A. baumannii isolates are the most frequent carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. in China, and the bla OXA-24-like and bla OXA-58-like genes have emerged as potential threats of hospital outbreaks of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter spp.
