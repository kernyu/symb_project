We report long-term virologic response to etravirine and tenofovir/emtricitabine in four HIV-1-infected patients who had prior standard genotypic resistance testing showing an isolated K103N mutation (three acquired, one transmitted). In three patients tested, the K103N mutation was detected in cellular HIV-1 DNA whereas remaining suppressed on etravirine plus tenofovir/emtricitabine.
