PURPOSE: We evaluated whether 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose ([(18)F]FDG) and 3'-deoxy-3'-[(18)F]fluorothymidine ([(18)F]FLT) positron emission tomography (PET) could be used as imaging biomarkers of platinum resensitization in ovarian cancer. PROCEDURES: Paired platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer cells from the same patient, PEO1 and PEO4, grown as tumor xenografts in nude mice, were assessed by PET. RESULTS: The AKT inhibitor, API-2, resensitized platinum-resistant PEO4 tumors to cisplatin, leading to a markedly lower Ki67 labeling index (p </= 0.006, n = 6 per group). [(18)F]FDG-PET and [(18)F]FLT-PET imaging variables were lower after combination treatment compared with vehicle treatment (p </= 0.006, n = 6 per group). No changes were seen with either drug alone. PRAS40 phosphorylation status was a sensitive biochemical marker of pathway inhibition, whereas reductions thymidine kinase 1 expression defined the [(18)F]FLT response. CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic inhibition of AKT activation in acquired platinum-resistant disease can be imaged noninvasively by [(18)F]FDG-PET and [(18)F]FLT-PET warranting further assessment.
