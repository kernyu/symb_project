Due to their lower risk for induction of resistance, membrane-active antimicrobial peptides with anticancer effect are attractive in cancer therapy. Because cell binding contributes to the cytotoxicity of peptide, it is possible to enhance the cytotoxicity of antimicrobial peptide in tumor cells by conjugation to a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP). In this paper, a fusion peptide MPGA by conjugation of antimicrobial peptide MP to CPP Antp at its N-terminus was constructed. After compared the cytotoxicity of unconjugated MP with that of the fusion peptide, it was found that MPGA showed higher cytotoxicity than that of unconjugated MP. And the fusion peptide MPGA induced cell death in tumor cells by membrane disruption. These results demonstrated that the cytotoxicity of antimicrobial peptide can be significantly enhanced by conjugation to CPP, which might be an effective way to develop novel anticancer drugs.
