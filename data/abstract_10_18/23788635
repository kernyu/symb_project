UNLABELLED: Despite an increasing prevalence of patients with docetaxel-refractory prostate cancer, little is known about the tumor biology of the docetaxel-resistant residual tumor cells compared with primary tumor cells. In this study, tumorigenic potential was increased in the docetaxel-resistant residual prostate cancer cell lines (DRD, 1G7 and PC3DR) compared with parental cells (DU145 or PC3). Enhanced tumorigenic potential was conferred by oncogenic c-Myc, which was stabilized by constitutively activated ERK1/2 in DRD, 1G7, and PC3DR cells. Constitutively activated ERK1/2 was maintained by CXCR4, which was upregulated in DRD, 1G7, and PC3DR cells. In docetaxel-treated DU145 cells, transiently activated ERK1/2 induced CXCR4 expression by stabilizing c-Myc. Furthermore, constitutive activation of CXCR4, ERK1/2, and c-Myc signaling was evident in clinical tissue samples from human patients with docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer. In DTX-resistant residual prostate cancer cells, the enhanced tumorigenic potential was reduced by ERK1/2 inhibition, or by AMD3100, a CXCR4 antagonist. Thus, docetaxel treatment constitutively activated the CXCR4, ERK1/2, and c-Myc signaling loop in docetaxel-resistant residual prostate cancer cells. IMPLICATIONS: Constitutive signaling pathways are viable therapeutic targets for residual prostate tumor cells following acquisition of docetaxel resistance.
