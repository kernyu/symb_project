An epidemic of Serratia marcescens was studied in a neonatal intensive care unit in a tertiary hospital by evaluating both infections and colonizations by this microorganism. Over a 14-month period, 26 infants were infected with S. marcescens (bacteriemias or bronchopneumonias). All the S. marcescens isolates studied by PFGE were identical, although their antimicrobial resistance varied. No environmental reservoirs were found. In the concurrent case-control study, the risk factors for infection were stay of more than 1 month, mechanical ventilation and anemia.
