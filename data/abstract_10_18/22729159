PURPOSE: Suramin, a polysulfonated naphthylurea, inhibits the actions of polypeptide growth factors including acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors (aFGF and bFGF), which confer broad spectrum chemotherapy resistance. We hypothesized that suramin at non-cytotoxic doses in combination with weekly paclitaxel would be well tolerated and demonstrate anti-tumor activity. METHODS: Women with metastatic breast cancer who had been previously treated with a taxane in the adjuvant or metastatic setting were eligible. The primary objective of the phase I was to determine the dose of intravenous (IV) weekly suramin that resulted in plasma concentrations between 10 and 50 umol/l over 8-48 h (or the target range) in combination with IV 80 mg/m(2) of weekly paclitaxel. The primary objective of the phase II trial was to determine the anti-tumor activity of the dosing regimen defined in phase I. Therapy was continued until disease progression or development of unacceptable toxicity. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were enrolled (9: phase I; 22: phase II). In phase I, no dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Pharmacokinetics during the first cycle showed suramin concentrations within the target range for 21 of 24 weekly treatments (88 %). In phase II, the objective response rate (ORR) was 23 % (95 % CI 8-45 %), the median progression-free survival was 3.4 months (95 % CI 2.1-4.9 months), and the median overall survival was 11.2 months (95 % CI 6.6-16.0 months). CONCLUSIONS: Non-cytotoxic doses of suramin in combination with weekly paclitaxel were well tolerated. The efficacy was below the pre-specified criteria required to justify further investigation.
