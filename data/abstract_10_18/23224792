BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There is no ideal therapy for eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of 1-week triple therapy with rabeprazole, levofloxacin, and tinidazole in a metronidazole resistance prevalent region for eradicating H. pylori infection in patients with gastroduodenal ulcers. METHODS: This was an open-label, prospective study. Consecutive patients with endoscopy-proven duodenal or gastric ulcer and who were H. pylori-positive were treated with levofloxacin 500 mg once a day, rabeprazole 20 mg twice a day, and tinidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days followed by rabeprazole 20 mg OD for 8 weeks. Endoscopy was repeated 8 weeks after the end of therapy to check for ulcer healing and H. pylori status. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-one patients with gastroduodenal ulcers (duodenal 118, and gastric 13) were included. Drug compliance was 97.7 %. The eradication rate of H. pylori by intention-to-treat analysis was 85.5 % (95 % confidence interval 79.5-91.5) (112 of 131 patients) and by per-protocol analysis was 91.8 % (95 % confidence interval 86.9-96.7) (112 of 122 patients). Adverse effects were reported in 17 %: abdominal pain in 3.05 %, metallic taste in 6.87 %, and nausea and vomiting in 4.58 %. CONCLUSIONS: Levofloxacin-tinidazole-based triple therapy was highly effective and safe as a first-line regimen in Indian patients with gastroduodenal ulcer disease associated with H. pylori infection. The regimen was well tolerated.
