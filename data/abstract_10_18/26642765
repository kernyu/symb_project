The design, synthesis, in vitro inhibitory potency, and pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of Ko143 analogs are described. Compared to commonly used Ko143, the new breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) inhibitor (compound A) showed the same potency and a significantly improved PK profile in rats (lower clearance [1.54L/h/kg] and higher bioavailability [123%]). Ko143 on the other hand suffers from poor bioavailability. Compared to Ko143, compound A would be a useful probe for delineating the role of BCRP during in vivo studies in animals.
