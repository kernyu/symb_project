OBJECTIVE: To clarify therapeutic effects of azithromycin, clarithromycin, minocycline and tosufloxacin against macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MRMP) pneumonia and against macrolide-sensitive Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MSMP) pneumonia in pediatric patients. METHODS: A prospective, multicenter observational study was conducted from July 2013 to August 2015. The therapeutic effects of azithromycin, clarithromycin, minocycline and tosufloxacin were evaluated in 59 patients with pneumonia caused by MRMP and in 50 patients with pneumonia caused by MSMP. In vitro activities of antimicrobial agents against isolates of Mycoplasma pneumoniae were also measured. RESULTS: Mean durations of fever following commencement of treatment in patients infected with MRMP and MSMP were 5.2 and 1.9 days, respectively (log-rank test, P < 0.0001). Among patients infected with MRMP, mean durations of fever were 4.6, 5.5, 1.0 and 7.5 days for patients treated with azithromycin, clarithromycin, minocycline and tosufloxacin, respectively (log-rank test, P < 0.0001). Among patients infected with MSMP, mean durations of fever were 2.5, 1.7, 0.9 and 4.3 days for patients treated with azithromycin, clarithromycin, minocycline and tosufloxacin, respectively (log-rank test, P = 0.0162). The MIC90s of azithromycin and clarithromycin among the 27 isolates of MRMP were 64 and 256 mug/ml, respectively, and those among the 23 isolates of MSMP were <0.000125 and 0.001 mug/ml, respectively. The MIC90s of minocycline and tosufloxacin among the 27 isolates of MRMP were 1.0 and 0.25 mug/ml, respectively, and those among the 23 isolates of MSMP were 1.0 and 0.5 mug/ml, respectively. CONCLUSION: Both minocycline and tosufloxacin showed good in vitro activities against MRMP. Minocycline, but not tosufloxacin, shortened the duration of fever in pediatric patients infected with MRMP compared to the duration of fever in patients treated with macrolides.
