OBJECTIVE: Urinary tract infections (UTI) are the most common hospital infections. Complications include sepsis and shock. Immunosuppressed transplant surgery patients may experience loss of the graft due to UTI. The purpose of this study was to determine the main microorganisms responsible for UTIs among patients of transplant wards compared to urologic wards. Additionally, drug susceptibility profiles of the most frequent microorganisms were analyzed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the results of positive urine cultures from patients on 2 transplant versus 1 urologic ward in 2010. RESULTS: The most common pathogen in urine samples from all 3 wards was Escherichia coli. Often, other Gram-negative bacilli of the genus Klebsiella spp, were cultured as well as Gram-positive cocci (Enterococcus spp). Yeasts of the genus Candida were only found in urine of patients of transplant wards. The percentage of resistant bacteria was much higher among bacteria from transplant patients. CONCLUSIONS: The high level of antimicrobial resistance of microorganisms isolated from the urine of transplant patients and the relatively high incidence of fungal infections, demand an especially quick, accurate microbiological diagnosis for this group of patients.
