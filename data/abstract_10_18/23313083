We report a case of lower urinary tract infection due to KPC-2-producing K. pneumoniae (KpCG02) in an elderly patient who had recently been hospitalized in Greece. The patient was treated successfully on an outpatient basis by removing the Foley catheter and with a prophylactic dose of gentamicin. KpCG02, which belonged to ST258, contained repFII plasmids that tested positive for the vagCD addiction system and the uge, wabG, urea, mrkD, and fimH virulence factors. This case reemphasizes the need for vigilance screening for carbapenem-resistant Gram negatives in patients with a history of travel to endemic areas, such as Greece.
