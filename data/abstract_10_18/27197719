There is limited information on the variations of HIV-1 DNA mutation profile in reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease (PR) genes during suppressive antiretroviral treatment (plasma HIV-1 RNA continuously <50 copies/ml) with raltegravir (RAL)-based regimens in patients with baseline RT/PR resistant HIV. Twelve multidrug resistant (RT: 12/12, PR: 8/12) HIV-infected patients were followed during effectively suppressive RAL-based therapy. Total and integrated HIV-1 DNA were assessed by real time PCR at baseline and every 6 months. Ultrasensitive (threshold: 2.5 copies/ml) plasma HIV-1 RNA and genotypic analysis of RT and PR in proviral DNA were performed at baseline and at 24 months. Half of the patients had full viral suppression (plasma HIV-RNA < 2.5 copies/ml) at month 12. Total HIV-1 DNA declined significantly after 12 months of therapy (from 249.2 to 145.7 copies/10(6) cells, P = 0.023), and remained stable until 24 months, when total HIV-1 DNA levels raised, concomitantly with a less stringent suppression of HIV-1 RNA (81.8% of patients with >2.5 copies/ml). Integrated HIV-1 DNA did not show fluctuations during the study period. Sequencing of the PR and RT regions from HIV-1 DNA revealed changes in the resistance mutation profile in five patients. Total HIV-1 DNA declined after the introduction of RAL-based therapy, with a rebound after 2 years. No changes were observed in levels of integrated DNA, suggesting limited effect on archived HIV. The RT and PR sequence changes in archived HIV-1 DNA suggest that variation of the mutation profile can occur even in the absence of detectable HIV-1 RNA. J. Med. Virol. 88:2115-2124, 2016.
