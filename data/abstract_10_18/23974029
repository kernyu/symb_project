The importance of gene regulation in the enzootic cycle of Borrelia burgdorferi, the spirochete that causes Lyme disease, is well established. B. burgdorferi regulates gene expression in response to changes in environmental stimuli associated with changing hosts. In this study, we monitored mRNA decay in B. burgdorferi following transcriptional arrest with actinomycin D. The time-dependent decay of transcripts encoding RNA polymerase subunits (rpoA and rpoS), ribosomal proteins (rpsD, rpsK, rpsM, rplQ, and rpsO), a nuclease (pnp), outer surface lipoproteins (ospA and ospC), and a flagellar protein (flaB) have different profiles and indicate half-lives ranging from approximately 1 min to more than 45 min in cells cultured at 35 degrees C. Our results provide a first step in characterizing mRNA decay in B. burgdorferi and in investigating its role in gene expression and regulation.
