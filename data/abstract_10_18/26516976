INTRODUCTION: Exposure to subinhibitory concentrations (SICs) of antimicrobials may alter the bacterial transcriptome. METHODS: Here, we evaluated the expression of nine virulence-related genes in vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) urinary tract infection isolates grown at SICs of vancomycin. RESULTS: A Subinhibitory concentrations of vancomycin interferes with gene modulation, but does not affect the phenotype of a VRE strain in vitro . CONCLUSIONS: Subinhibitory concentrations of vancomycin may regulate the expression of virulence factors in vivo or contribute to the selection of vancomycin-resistant strains.
