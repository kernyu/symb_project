The objective of this study was to compare the performance of disk diffusion and agar dilution for the determination of susceptibility to ampicillin/sulbactam (SAM), ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem, meropenem, polymyxin B and tigecycline of 121 Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates. The antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods were performed as recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). For SAM, in addition the Etest method was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The error rates for the antimicrobial agents for 121 isolates tested were within the acceptable ranges established by the CLSI, with the exception of SAM and polymyxin B. For polymyxin B, there were 1.7% very major errors and for SAM there were 15% comparing disk diffusion with agar dilution. The very major error rate of SAM comparing the Etest with agar dilution was 10%. These high observed rates of very major error cast doubt on the disk diffusion and Etest techniques as appropriate methods for detecting resistance to SAM.
