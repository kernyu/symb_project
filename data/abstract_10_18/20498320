We have developed a simple PCR-based high-resolution melt curve analysis for identification of the quinolone resistance gene aac(6')-Ib-cr through regions encompassing the two defining single nucleotide mutations. Dissociation curves showed 100% concordance with DNA sequencing, including the identification of a strain where aac(6')-Ib and aac(6')-Ib-cr coexist.
