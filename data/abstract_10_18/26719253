UNLABELLED: MxB restricts HIV-1 infection by directly interacting with the HIV-1 core, which is made of viral capsid; however, the contribution of MxB to the HIV-1 restriction observed in alpha interferon (IFN-alpha)-treated human cells is unknown. To understand this contribution, we used HIV-1 bearing the G208R capsid mutant (HIV-1-G208R), which overcomes the restriction imposed by cells expressing MxB. Here we showed that the reason why MxB does not block HIV-1-G208R is that MxB does not interact with HIV-1 cores bearing the mutation G208R. To understand whether MxB contributes to the HIV-1 restriction imposed by IFN-alpha-treated human cells, we challenged IFN-alpha-treated cells with HIV-G208R and found that MxB does not contribute to the restriction imposed by IFN-alpha-treated cells. To more directly test the contribution of MxB, we challenged IFN-alpha-treated human cells that are knocked out for the expression of MxB with HIV-1. These experiments suggested that MxB does not contribute to the HIV-1 restriction observed in IFN-alpha-treated human cells. IMPORTANCE: MxB is a restriction factor that blocks HIV-1 infection in human cells. Although it has been postulated that MxB is the factor that blocks HIV-1 infection in IFN-alpha-treated cells, this is a hard concept to grasp due to the great number of genes that are induced by IFN-alpha in cells from the immune system. The work presented here elegantly demonstrates that MxB has minimal or no contribution to the ability of IFN-alpha-treated human cells to block HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, this work suggests the presence of novel restriction factors in IFN-alpha-treated human cells that block HIV-1 infection.
