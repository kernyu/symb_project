The efficacy of daptomycin, imipenem, or rifampin with fosfomycin was evaluated and compared with that of daptomycin-rifampin in a tissue cage model infection caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Strain HUSA 304 was used. The study yielded the following results for MICs (in mug/ml): fosfomycin, 4; daptomycin, 1; imipenem, 0.25; and rifampin, 0.03. The study yielded the following results for minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) (in mug/ml): fosfomycin, 8; daptomycin, 4; imipenem, 32; and rifampin, 0.5. Daptomycin-rifampin was confirmed as the most effective therapy against MRSA foreign-body infections. Fosfomycin combinations with high doses of daptomycin and rifampin were efficacious alternative therapies in this setting. Fosfomycin-imipenem was relatively ineffective and did not protect against resistance.
