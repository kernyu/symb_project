Bacterial blight, an important and potentially destructive bacterial disease in rice, is caused by Xanthomonas oryzae. Recently, this organism has developed resistance to available antibiotics, prompting scientists to find a suitable alternative. This study focused on secondary metabolites of Phomopsis longicolla to target X. oryzae. Five bioactive compounds were isolated by activity-guided fractionation from ethyl acetate extracts of mycelia and were identified by LC/MS and NMR spectroscopy as dicerandrol A, dicerandrol B, dicerandrol C, deacetylphomoxanthone B, and fusaristatin A. This is the first time fusaristatin A has been isolated from Phomopsis sp. Deacetylphomoxanthone B showed a higher antibacterial effect against X. oryzae KACC 10331 than the positive control (2,4-diacetyphloroglucinol). Dicerandrol A also showed high antimicrobial activity against Grampositive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis) and yeast (Candida albicans). In addition, high production yields of these compounds were obtained at the stationary and death phases.
