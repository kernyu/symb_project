Halophilic gammaproteobacteria of the family Halomonadaceae (including the genera Aidingimonas, Carnimonas, Chromohalobacter, Cobetia, Halomonas, Halotalea, Kushneria, Modicisalibacter, Salinicola, and Zymobacter) have current and promising applications in biotechnology mainly as a source of compatible solutes (powerful stabilizers of biomolecules and cells, with exciting potentialities in biomedicine), salt-tolerant enzymes, biosurfactants, and extracellular polysaccharides, among other products. In addition, they display a number of advantages to be used as cell factories, alternative to conventional prokaryotic hosts like Escherichia coli or Bacillus, for the production of recombinant proteins: (1) their high salt tolerance decreases to a minimum the necessity for aseptic conditions, resulting in cost-reducing conditions, (2) they are very easy to grow and maintain in the laboratory, and their nutritional requirements are simple, and (3) the majority can use a large range of compounds as a sole carbon and energy source. In the last 15 years, the efforts of our group and others have made possible the genetic manipulation of this bacterial group. In this review, the most relevant and recent tools for their genetic manipulation are described, with emphasis on nucleic acid isolation procedures, cloning and expression vectors, genetic exchange mechanisms, mutagenesis approaches, reporter genes, and genetic expression analyses. Complementary sections describing the influence of salinity on the susceptibility of these bacteria to antimicrobials, as well as the growth media most routinely used and culture conditions, for these microorganisms, are also included.
