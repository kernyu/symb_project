Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare hereditary disease in which phagocytes have difficulty forming the superoxide radical required to kill certain pathogens. Individuals with CGD are susceptible to a specific set of infections and granulomatous lesions. We present the case of a 15-year-old boy with X-linked CGD who presented with unremitting cough and fevers. He had a left-sided pneumonia that persisted despite home intravenous antibiotics. He was admitted to an outside facility for bronchoalveolar lavage to obtain cultures and polymerase chain reaction. Computed tomography of chest, abdomen, and pelvis was done for baseline evaluation of extent of disease. Computed tomography revealed a fluid collection in the prostatic fossa, later determined to be a prostatic abscess. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a prostatic abscess in a pediatric patient with CGD.
