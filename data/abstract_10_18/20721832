Potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) has transformed HIV infection into a chronic manageable disease, but drug resistance remains a common problem that limits the effectiveness and clinical benefits of treatment. With increasing experience with ART, the understanding of viral dynamics of HIV improved, and researchers learned how challenging HIV can be to control. With new-class and new-generation drugs, it is hoped that the lessons learned will be useful for limiting drug resistance and optimizing the use of ART for long-term management of HIV infection.
