OBJECTIVE: Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) ensure appropriate antibiotic use, reduce health care costs, and minimize antibiotic resistance. National asthma guidelines do not recommend antibiotics during an exacerbation unless the child has an infection or comorbidities. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) established a benchmark for unjustified antibiotic use at 6.6%.9 A retrospective study at our institution showed that 7.8% of antibiotics were prescribed without justification in children admitted for asthma. The purpose of this study was to reduce unjustified antibiotic use at our institution by 25% in children through an ASP directed toward asthma. METHODS: The study period lasted from November 2015 to March 2016. Children 6 months to 17 years of age, admitted for an asthma exacerbation, were included while those with comorbidities were excluded. A multidisciplinary team from pediatric pharmacotherapy, pulmonology, emergency department (ED), infectious diseases, and quality improvement was formed to focus on process improvement. Interventions were executed in a series of Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles. In cycle 1, our asthma guidelines on appropriate antibiotic use were disseminated to pediatric house staff and posted in pediatric units. Cycle 2 encompassed presenting the ASP and guidelines to the pediatric ED staff. Cycle 3 consisted of a journal club with the pulmonary division to discuss the role of azithromycin in an asthma exacerbation. RESULTS: In cycle 1, twenty-four patients were reviewed in November 2015. Antibiotics were prescribed in 8/24 (33%) children, with an unjustified rate of 2/24 (8.3%). In cycle 2, twenty-three patients were reviewed in December and January with 8/23 (35%) prescribed antibiotics and an unjustified rate of 2/23 (8.7%). For cycle 3, in February and March 2016, twenty-one children were reviewed. Antibiotics were prescribed in 6/21 (27%) children and all were justified. In total, 68 patients were included in our study and had an unjustified antibiotic prescribing rate of 4/68 (5.9%), a reduction of 25%. CONCLUSION: Our ASP surpassed the benchmark set by AAP guidelines, by reducing the percentage of unjustified antibiotics in children with asthma to 5.9%.
