INTRODUCTION: Despite being relatively infrequent, prosthetic joint infections are a devastating medical complication. However, recent advances in surgical techniques, new antibiotics, and knowledge about pathogenic mechanisms have improved the outcome for affected patients. AREAS COVERED: We have analyzed recent advances in pathogenesis, medical and surgical therapy of prosthetic joint infections, with special focus on new antibiotics useful for this disease. Recent studies focused on the important role of biofilms and intracellular bacteria in the pathogenesis of biomaterial-related infections. These advances must guide the management of the patients. Together with more classical antibiotics, linezolid and daptomycin have shown their usefulness for the treatment of these infections. Recently developed lipoglycopeptides have the potential to be used for these infections. In this sense, the possibility of treating patients with oral antibiotics without lack of efficacy is of great interest. EXPERT OPINION: Individualized therapies that take into account the microbial etiology, pathogenesis of the disease, antimicrobial susceptibility, and efficacy of antibiotics against biofilms and intracellular organisms make it possible to treat even those infections caused by multidrug-resistant organisms. A multidisciplinary approach (including a surgeon, infectious diseases specialist and microbiologist) provides the best possible management of patients.
