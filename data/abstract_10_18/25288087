New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) was first identified in Brazil in Enterobacter hormaechei and Providencia rettgeri in 2013. Here, we describe the first case of NDM-1-producing Acinetobacter baumannii sequence type 25 isolated from the urinary tract of a 71-year-old man who died of multiple complications, including A. baumannii infection. The NDM-1 gene was detected by quantitative PCR, and its sequence confirmed its presence in an approximately 100-kb plasmid.
