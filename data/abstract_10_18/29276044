Most multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) P. aeruginosa strains belonged to epidemic high-risk (EHR) clones that succeeded worldwide in the context of hospital outbreaks. In order to study the intraclonal diversity in EHR P. aeruginosa, we selected clinical and environmental strains of the EHR clone ST308 that caused outbreak clusters over five years in a hospital and then persisted in the hospital environment during four additional years, causing sporadic infections. Unexpectedly, resistance phenotype was very diverse within the population, independently of the origin (environmental or human) and the period of isolation (during or after outbreaks). Most MDR/XDR strains belonged to clusters in pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) while singleton strains instead displayed susceptible or moderately resistant phenotypes. High diversity was observed for motility and biofilm formation without correlation with the origin and the period. Resistance to biocides was not linked to epidemic success or to environmental persistence. Finally, the EHR clone ST308 did not display common adaptive traits, nor traits related to an origin or a period of isolation in the hospital. The major character of this EHR clone ST308 is its intraclonal diversity that probably warrants its adaptation and persistence in hospital whatever the conditions and therefore its epidemic behaviour. This diversity could result from adaptive radiation with the evolution of multiple lineages that fill available niches within a complex ecosystem such as a hospital.
