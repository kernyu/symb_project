OBJECTIVES: To assess the activity of ceftolozane, a novel oxyimino-cephalosporin, in comparison with ceftazidime and piperacillin/tazobactam against a multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain using a murine model of pneumonia. METHODS: Quantitative bacteriology, survival, histological examination, myeloperoxidase activity, proinflammatory cytokine levels in lungs and endothelial permeability were evaluated to determine the effects of ceftolozane and comparators on P. aeruginosa-induced pneumonia. RESULTS: After 48 h of treatment, ceftolozane reduced the bacterial load by 3-4 log(10) cfu/g of lung. Systemic dissemination of the pulmonary infection and development of lung damage were inhibited in all beta-lactam-treated animals. P. aeruginosa-induced pneumonia led to elevated concentrations of tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2 in the lungs. While the levels of proinflammatory cytokines decreased following ceftazidime and piperacillin/tazobactam therapy, ceftolozane exhibited increased concentrations of IL-1beta and MIP-2 after 24 h of infection, resulted in significantly increased levels of recruited neutrophils within the infected lung without increasing lung endothelial permeability. CONCLUSIONS: These data strongly support ceftolozane as an effective option for the treatment of severe P. aeruginosa respiratory infections by improving the early pulmonary inflammatory response without impairing 48 h post-infection homeostasis.
