BACKGROUND: Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) are major opportunistic pathogens in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. The use of antivirals for the treatment of HCMV disease can result in the development of drug resistance mutations in HCMV and also potentially in HHV-6. OBJECTIVES: The emergence of HHV-6 drug resistance mutations was evaluated in SOT recipients at the onset of HCMV disease and following treatment with ganciclovir (GCV) or valganciclovir (VGCV). STUDY DESIGN: Detection of HHV-6 was performed by real-time PCR from whole blood samples serially obtained from SOT recipients treated for HCMV disease with an induction dose of intravenous GCV or oral VGCV for 21 days followed by VGCV maintenance for 28 days in both arms. Baseline and last positive HHV-6 samples were tested for mutations in the genes encoding the protein kinase (U69) and the DNA polymerase (U38). RESULTS: The rate of HHV-6 viraemia among SOT patients with HCMV disease at baseline was 3.2% (5/155). All isolates belonged to the HHV-6B species. Mutations L213I and Y479H were detected at baseline and at later times in the U69 kinase. Mutation L213I was previously reported as polymorphism whereas the role of mutation Y479H in drug resistance is unknown. Mutations D854E and E855Q found in the DNA polymerase were known as natural variants. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of HHV-6 viraemia in SOT recipients with established HCMV disease before initiation of antiviral therapy was low. Treatment with GCV or VGCV did not induce the emergence of HHV-6 drug resistance mutations.
