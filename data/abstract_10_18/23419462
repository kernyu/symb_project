Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) remains a major problem of public health in France. Voluntary networks of physicians (ResIST) and laboratories (Renago, Renachla, lymphogranuloma venereum: LGV network) produce indicators showing the evolution of the main bacterial STIs. In 2010, the main findings were the following. The number of gonococcal infections has increased throughout the decade 2000 to 2010. The decrease in susceptibility of gonococcal strains to first-line antibiotics (extended-spectrum cephalosporins) needs to keep great attention. The number of screening and diagnosis of chlamydial urogenital infections also continues to rise in both sexes, particularly due to increased screening among young people. The relatively stable number of cases of early syphilis and of rectal LGV needs to be confirmed over the coming years. Both of these STIs affect overwhelmingly homo/bisexual men. There is still a high level of HIV co-infection with LGV and syphilis, and to a lesser extent with gonorrhea. We observe that condom use is still inadequate, especially during oral sex.
