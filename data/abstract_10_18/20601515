Applying the genomic library construction process and colony screening, a novel aroA gene encoding 5-enopyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase from Ochrobactrum anthropi was identified, cloned, and overexpressed, and the enzyme was purified to homogeneity. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis was employed to assess the role of single amino acid residues in glyphosate resistance.
