While the safety and efficacy profiles of orally administered bovine interferon (IFN) alpha have been documented, the mechanism(s) that result in clinical benefits remain elusive. One approach to delineating the molecular pathways of IFN efficacy is through the use of gene expression profiling technologies. In this proof-of-concept study, different (0, 50, 200 and 800 units) oral doses of natural bovine IFN (type I) were tested in cattle to determine if oral IFN altered the expression of genes that may be pivotal to the development of systemic resistance to viral infections such as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). Oral IFN was administered twice: Time 0 and 8h later. Blood was collected at 0, 8 and 24h after the first IFN administration, and DNA isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was employed in quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) microarray assays. Within 8h, 50 and 200 units of oral IFN induced significant (P<0.05) changes in expression of 41 of 92 tested autoimmune and inflammatory response-associated genes. These data suggest that orally administered IFN is a viable approach for providing short-term antiviral immunity to livestock exposed to viruses such as FMD virus (FMDV) until such a time that an effective vaccine can be produced and distributed to producers.
