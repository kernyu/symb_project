Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative bacterium causing nosocomial infections worldwide. To gain quick insight into the molecular basis of biofilm formation in A. baumannii, we determined the complete genome sequence of A. baumannii strain 1656-2, which forms sturdy biofilm and is resistant to multiple drugs.
