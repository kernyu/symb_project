OBJECTIVE: The online software ConsoRes is used to collect and analyze data on antibiotic consumption and evolution of bacterial resistance in healthcare institutions in every hospital ward (HW). We report the first results of ConsoRes implementation in the northeast hospitals of France. METHODOLOGY: ConsoRes was implemented in January 2011, in nine volunteer hospitals after performing an onsite assessment. Five of these hospitals were already monitoring antibiotic consumption with a network such as Raisin ATB or Antibiolor, providing feedback on the various evaluation tools. RESULTS: The ConsoRes data collection import function meets expectations of pharmacists, bacteriologists, or clinicians since it is user friendly, prevents redundant data input, and allows data transfer to the national databases. Importing the hospital organizational structure prevents mistakes on consumption allocation, which was noted in the previous databases, and makes comparison and benchmark analysis reliable. ConsoRes also provides a rapid consumption data feedback to all registered users within the hospital, whether in charge of a ward (clinician) or having a transversal function (pharmacist, bacteriologist). The availability of an automatic standard report or of an online customized report is another major feature of ConsoRes. CONCLUSION: Besides providing surveillance, the concomitant analysis of local antibiotic consumption and bacterial resistance should have an educational impact by allowing each user to implement actions within the framework of antibiotic stewardship.
