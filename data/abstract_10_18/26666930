OXA-48-like carbapenemases have only recently emerged in Europe. OXA-162 is a rare OXA-48 variant usually coexpressed with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. Here, we report the identification of the first OXA-162 carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, which coexpressed an AmpC cephalosporinase (DHA-1), retrieved from a patient in Greece. They belonged to a single sequence type (ST11) and caused the first documented community-onset urinary tract infections attributable to an OXA-48-like-producing Enterobacteriaceae strain.
