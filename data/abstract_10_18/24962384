In recent years bacterial resistance has been observed against many of our current antibiotics, for instance most worryingly against the cephalosporins which are typically the last line of defence against many bacterial infections. Additionally the failure of high throughput screening in the discovery of new antibacterial drug leads has led to a decline in the number of antibacterial agents reaching the market. Alternative methods of drug discovery including structure based drug design are needed to meet the threats caused by the emergence of resistance. In this review we explore the latest advancements in the identification of new antibacterial agents through the use of a number of structure based drug design programs.
