OBJECTIVES: Precise assessment of potential therapeutic synergy, antagonism or indifference between antimicrobial agents currently depends on time-consuming and hard-to-standardize in vitro chequerboard titration methods. We here present a method based on a novel two-dimensional antibiotic gradient technique named Xact. METHODS: We used a test comprising a combination of perpendicular gradients of meropenem and colistin in a single quadrant. We compared test outcomes with those obtained with classical chequerboard microbroth dilution testing in a study involving 27 unique strains of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii from diverse origins. RESULTS: We were able to demonstrate 92% concordance between the new technology and classical chequerboard titration using the A. baumannii collection. Two strains could not be analysed by Xact due to their out-of-range MIC of meropenem (>128 mg/L). CONCLUSIONS: The new test was shown to be diagnostically useful, easy to implement and less labour intensive than the classical method.
