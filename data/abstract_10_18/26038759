Both Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis can form biofilms on natural surfaces or abiotic surfaces, such as medical implants, resulting in biofilm-associated diseases that are refractory to antibiotic treatment. We previously reported a promising antibacterial compound (Compound 2) and its derivatives with bactericidal and anti-biofilm activities against both S. epidermidis and S. aureus. We have further evaluated the antibacterial activities of four Compound 2 derivatives (H2-38, H2-39, H2-74 and H2-81) against 163 clinical strains of S. epidermidis and S. aureus, including methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant strains, as well as biofilm-forming and non-biofilm-forming strains. The four derivatives inhibited the planktonic growth of all of the clinical staphylococcal isolates, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis and displayed bactericidal activities against both immature (6 h) and mature (24 h) biofilms formed by the strong biofilm-forming strains. The derivatives, which all target YycG, will help us to develop new antimicrobial agents against multidrug-resistant staphylococci infections and biofilm-associated diseases.
