Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), extracted from propolis, was evaluated for the ameliorative effects on insulin resistance and the mechanisms were identified, using non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) model mice and insulin resistance (IR) model cells. After 5 weeks of CAPE supplementation, insulin sensitivity, hyperlipidemia, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) levels were improved in mice. Proinflammatory cytokines in serum and the expressions of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) mRNA in tissues were markedly downregulated from CAPE-treated mice. In vitro, CAPE supplement significantly improved glucose consumption, glucose uptake, glycogen content, and oxidative stress and decreased expression of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) mRNA in cells. Both in vivo and in vitro, CAPE enhanced p-Akt (Ser473) and p-insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 (Tyr612), but inhibited p-JNK (Thr183/Tyr185), p-NF-kappaB p65 (Ser536), and nuclear translocation of p-NF-kappaB p65 (Ser536). In summary, CAPE can ameliorate insulin resistance through modulation of JNK and NF-kappaB signaling pathway in mice and HepG2 cells.
