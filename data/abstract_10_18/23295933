A total of 146 group B streptococcus isolates from 8 cities across China belonged to four serotypes. Serotype Ia was more common in children. A high prevalence of resistance was observed for levofloxacin (37.7%), erythromycin (71.2%), clindamycin, (53.4%), and tetracycline (81.5%). The levofloxacin and clindamycin resistances among the 4 serotypes differed significantly. Eighty percent of fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates belonged to the sequence type 19 (ST19)/serotype III clone, with GyrA-ParC-ParE triple substitutions. This clone carried the erm(B), mef(E), and tet(M) genes.
