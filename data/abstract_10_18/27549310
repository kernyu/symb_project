Lincosamides, streptogramins, phenicols, and pleuromutilins (LSPPs) represent four structurally different classes of antimicrobial agents that inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by binding to particular sites on the 50S ribosomal subunit of the ribosomes. Members of all four classes are used for different purposes in human and veterinary medicine in various countries worldwide. Bacteria have developed ways and means to escape the inhibitory effects of LSPP antimicrobial agents by enzymatic inactivation, active export, or modification of the target sites of the agents. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the mode of action of LSPP antimicrobial agents as well as of the mutations and resistance genes known to confer resistance to these agents in various bacteria of human and animal origin.
