Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been demonstrated to reduce the risk to develop diabetes mellitus (DM). However no previous experimental study had investigated its effect on the structure of the endocrine pancreas, islets of Langerhans (IOL), in insulin resistance (IR). In addition, the mechanism by which HCQ can prevent DM is not well understood. In this study, we hypothesized that the possible favorable outcome of HCQ may be partly achieved by its molecular effect on the endothelial stress markers as well as on the imparied balance of the adipokines that usually accompanies IR. A total of 54 rats were divided equally into; control, high fat diet (HFD) and HFD+HCQ groups (received standard chow, HFD and HFD+HCQ respectively). After 12 weeks, samples from pancreas as well as visceral adipose tissue (VAT) were histologically studied for the consequent changes. In the HFD group, there were mild degenerative changes and expansion of the IOL accompanied with a significantly increased (p<0.05) beta-cell area%, mass, proliferation and neogenesis as well as a significantly decreased (p<0.05) alpha-cell area% compared with the other groups. On combining HCQ with HFD, reversal of these changes along with correction of the impaired adipokines levels (leptin, adiponectin, resistin, visfatin and lipocalin-2) and significant decrease (p<0.05) of the vascular endothelial stress markers (sE-selectin, sICAM and sVICAM) were manifested compared with the HFD group. Therefore, HCQ favorable effects in IR may be attributed to relieving of the endothelial stress as well as normalization of the skewed balance of adipokines.
