There is accumulating evidence that risk profiles differ between coronary artery disease and abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). However, diabetes mellitus (DM) appears to be negatively associated with AAA formation. The underlying mechanisms for this negative relationship are far from defined, but may include: increased arterial wall matrix formation via advanced glycation end products; suppression of plasmin and reduction of levels and activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and 9; diminished aortic wall macrophage infiltration, elastolysis and neovascularization. In addition, the effect of pharmacological agents used for the treatment of patients with DM on AAA formation has been studied with rather controversial results. Statins, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, fenofibrate, antibiotics and some hypoglycemic agents are beginning to be appreciated for a potential modest protection from AAAs, but further studies are needed.
