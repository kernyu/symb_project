Long-term treatment with retrotranscriptase (RT) inhibitors eventually leads to the development of drug resistance. Drug-related mutations occur naturally and these can be found in hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers who have never received antiviral therapy. HBsAg are overlapped with RT domain, thus nucleot(s)ide analogues (NAs) resistance mutations and naturally-occurring mutations can cause amino acid changes in the HBsAg. Twenty-two patients with chronic hepatitis B were enrolled; three of them were previously treated with NAs and 19 were NAs-naive treated. HBV reverse transcriptase region was sequenced; genotyping and analysis of missense mutations were performed in both RT domain and HBsAg. There was predominance of genotype H. Drug mutations were present in 18.2% of patients. Classical lamivudine resistance mutations (rtM204V/rtL180M) were present in one naive-treatment patient infected with genotype G. New amino acid changes were identified in drug resistance sites in HBV strains from patients infected with genotype H; rtQ215E was present in two naive-NAs treatment patients and rtI169M was identified in a patient previously treated with lamivudine. Mutations at sites rt169, rt204, and rt215 resulted in the Y161C, I195M, and C206W mutations at HBsAg. Also, new amino acid changes were identified in B-cell and T-cell epitopes and were more frequent in HBsAg compared to RT domain. In conclusion, new amino acid changes at antiviral resistance sites, B-cell and T-cell epitopes in HBV genotype H were identified in Mexican patients.
