This study was carried out to provide information regarding resistance pattern of community acquired uropathogens in a tertiary care hospital. A retrospective analysis of culture proven urine isolates was carried out over a period of 1 year (Jan-Dec 2009). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done by Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method and results were interpreted in accordance with the recommendation of clinical and laboratory standard institute (CLSI). Out of the total 10698 mid-stream urine samples received from suspected cases of urinary tract infection (UTI), 2124 (19.9%) were culture proven UTI cases. Escherichia coli was the most common isolate (54.6%) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (14.7%). Among gram-negative organism (E. coli) showed high resistance to amoxiclavulanate (91.7%) & cefodroxyl (73.1%). Quinolones have shown resistance among majority of the pathogens (ranging from 30-90%). Staph aureus and enterococcus species were found to be resistant to ampicillin (84.4% and 64.5%) and norfloxacin (69% and 58.7%). Nitrofurantoin may be considered as a first line agent for empiric treatment of uncomplicated out patients. Drug resistance is a common problem and need is for judicious use of antimicrobial agents after laboratory monitoring.
