AIMS: Since epidemiologic studies suggest that tobacco smoke toxins, e.g. the nicotine-derived nitrosamine ketone (NNK) tobacco-specific nitrosamine, can be a co-factor in alcohol-related brain disease (ARBD), we examined the independent and additive effects of alcohol and NNK exposures on spatial learning/memory, and brain insulin/IGF signaling, neuronal function and oxidative stress. METHODS: Adolescent Long Evans rats were fed liquid diets containing 0 or 26% caloric ethanol for 8 weeks. During weeks 3-8, rats were treated with i.p. NNK (2 mg/kg, 3x/week) or saline. In weeks 7-8, ethanol groups were binge-administered ethanol (2 g/kg; 3x/week). In week 8, at 12 weeks of age, rats were subjected to Morris Water Maze tests. Temporal lobes were used to assess molecular indices of insulin/IGF resistance, oxidative stress and neuronal function. RESULTS: Ethanol and NNK impaired spatial learning, and NNK +/- ethanol impaired memory. Linear trend analysis demonstrated worsening performance from control to ethanol, to NNK, and then ethanol + NNK. Ethanol +/- NNK, caused brain atrophy, inhibited insulin signaling through the insulin receptor and Akt, activated GSK-3beta, increased protein carbonyl and 3-nitrotyrosine, and reduced acetylcholinesterase. NNK increased NTyr. Ethanol + NNK had synergistic stimulatory effects on 8-iso-PGF-2alpha, inhibitory effects on p-p70S6K, tau and p-tau and trend effects on insulin-like growth factor type 1 (IGF-1) receptor expression and phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS: Ethanol, NNK and combined ethanol + NNK exposures that begin in adolescence impair spatial learning and memory in young adults. The ethanol and/or NNK exposures differentially impair insulin/IGF signaling through neuronal growth, survival and plasticity pathways, increase cellular injury and oxidative stress and reduce expression of critical proteins needed for neuronal function.
