The efficacy of radiation therapy (RT) for melanoma is limited in part by its radioresistance. Here, we examined the radiosensitizing effect of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) on a radioresistant melanoma cell line, HTB-65. We found that H(2)O(2) synergized with RT to inhibit melanoma cell proliferation and promote apoptosis. The antiproliferative effect of H(2)O(2)/RT correlated with increased expression of p15 and reduced expression of cyclin D, cyclin E, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)2 and CDK4. The pro-apoptotic effect of H(2)O(2) /RT correlated with reduced expression of the B-cell CLL/lymphoma (BCL)2. These data highlight the potential of H(2)O(2) as a radiation sensitizer for melanoma treatment and show that this warrants further study.
