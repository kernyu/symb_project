In the United States, veterinary use of mupirocin is primarily limited to the treatment of canine pyoderma caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP). In this study, only 1 of 581 S. pseudintermedius isolates tested was resistant to mupirocin and carried the high-level mupirocin resistance gene, ileS2, on a plasmid.
