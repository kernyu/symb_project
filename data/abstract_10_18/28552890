Bangladesh is considered as a high-risk country for emerging infectious diseases because of its high population density, poverty, and unhygienic conditions. Although control efforts have primarily been focused on major infectious diseases such as diarrheal diseases, tuberculosis, malaria, and HIV infection, the prevalence and impact of many local or minor infectious diseases are still unclarified in this country. In this review, we present our recent experience and outcomes of collaborative research on puerperal infection (PI), which is a poorly defined infectious disease in Bangladesh. PI is the most common complication during the perinatal period in developing countries. We investigated the incidence of individual species of aerobic bacteria causing PIs and their drug resistance, and the genetic traits of isolates during the two-year period (2010-2012). The common species of isolates from patients with PIs were Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. A remarkable finding was the high rates of resistance to cephalosporins among Gram-negative bacteria harboring extended-spectrum beta-lactamase genes, which were associated with carbapenem resistance in a few isolates. This study defined the importance of control of antimicrobial resistance in Bangladesh, and provided suggestions for the future direction of collaborative research on infectious diseases in Bangladesh.
