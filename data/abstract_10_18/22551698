Maternal transfer of antibodies from mother to eggs has been reported in various species of fishes, and these antibodies have been proposed to play immune roles in developing embryos and larvae. However, firm evidence supporting this remains lacking. In this study, we clearly demonstrated that immunization of female zebrafish with the hapten-carrier complex, trinitrophenylated bovine serum albumin (TNP-BSA), induced a significant increase in anti-TNP antibody production in the mothers, which in turn induced a marked increase in anti-TNP antibody level in their eggs. Microinjection of anti-zebrafish IgM antibody into early embryos (to neutralize endogenous antibody action) resulted in a remarkable decrease in the resistance of recipient embryos to pathogenic Aeromonas hydrophila, whereas injection of BSA or anti-beta-actin monoclonal antibody into the same stage embryos had little effect on their resistance to the pathogen. Moreover, the content of endogenous antibodies in eggs was clearly correlated with their antibacterial activity against A. hydrophila. This is the first report showing that maternally transferred antibodies in fish can protect early embyros/larvae from the attack of pathogens like A. hydrophila.
