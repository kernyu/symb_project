A total of 114 isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were collected from hospitals in Tehran, Iran. A multiplex PCR was designed to examine the presence of six different prophage classes. The results showed high diversity of bacteriophages, with four different prophage types and eight prophage patterns. An important S. aureus phage coding for several virulence factors, Phi-77-like phage, was detected in 97 % of the isolates. We found a high rate of resistance of MRSA isolates to penicillin, ciprofloxacin, tobramycin and kanamycin. This is the first study showing high prevalence and diverse bacteriophage populations in MRSA strains in Iranian hospitals.
