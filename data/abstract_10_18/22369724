BACKGROUND: Photodynamic inactivation (PDI) has been investigated to cope with the increasing incidence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens. Here we studied the PDI mediated by methylene blue (MB) and toluidine blue O (TBO) in clinical methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and MDR Escherichia coli, together with their corresponding American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) strains. METHODS: Effect of photosensitizer concentration (12.5, 25, 50 mug/ml) and laser irradiation time (10, 20 and 30 min) on lethal photosensitization was investigated. RESULTS: TBO was more effective. TBO at 50 mug/ml, 46.8 J cm(-)(2), exhibited 0.7 log killing for MDR E. coli and 1.7 log killing for E. coli (ATCC 25922); 3.1 log killing for MRSA, and 4.2 log killing for S. aureus (ATCC 25923). MB at 50 mug/ml, 163.8 J cm(-)(2), only exhibited 2.2 log killing in MRSA and 3.1 log killing in S. aureus (ATCC 25923). MB (50 mug/ml, 163.8 J cm(-)(2)) induced 0.2 log killing for MDR E. coli and 0.3 log killing for E. coli (ATCC 25922). After TBO-PDI, MDR isolates were more susceptible to some antibiotics than control groups. CONCLUSION: Our studied clinical isolates were more resistant to PDI-mediated killing than their ATCC reference strains. Thus, TBO/MB-mediated PDI in other MDR isolates deserves further investigation.
