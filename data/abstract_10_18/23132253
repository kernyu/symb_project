The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and genetic basis of multidrug resistance in Chryseobacterium indologenes from seawater and marine invertebrates used for human consumption, in Kastela Bay, Adriatic Sea, Croatia. Out of 16 samples of seawater, Mediterranean mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis Lam.), Rayed Mediterranean limpets (Patella caerulea L.) and Purple sea urchins (Paracentrotus lividus Lam.) collected, 15 were positive for C. indologenes. In total, 41 isolates were randomly selected and tested for antibiotic susceptibility by disc-diffusion and broth microdilution methods. PCR was used to detect alleles encoding extended-spectrum (ESBLs) and metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs). The clonality of beta-lactamase-producing strains was evaluated by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. All C. indologenes isolates showed multiple resistance to at least 9 out of 16 antibiotics tested. Lowest resistance rates were found for piperacillin (9.7 %) and ciprofloxacin (24.4 %), whereas only piperacillin/tazobactam and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole showed 100 % activity. More than half of isolates carried bla (IND)-type gene, including 2 isolates carrying bla (IND-2) and 21 carrying bla (IND-7), that was identified as a major MBL genotype in isolates from Adriatic Sea. RAPD typing of IND-producing isolates revealed 6 major groups with no predominant clone in population. The presence of multidrug resistant and IND-producing C. indologenes in marine environment, including marine fauna, pose a risk for transmitting this opportunistic pathogen to humans through recreation or consummation of seafood. In addition, the antibiotic susceptibility test results have practical relevance for empirical treatment of C. indologenes infections.
