Efflux pumps are a potent and clinically important cause of antibiotic resistance. The particular focus of this chapter is on the efflux pump as a target for antimicrobial therapy and the development of new antibacterials to address the efflux problem.Tigecycline is an example of how old antibiotics, in this case tetracyclines, which have become substrates for efflux pumps, can be extensively modified to restore antimicrobial activity and clinical efficacy.
