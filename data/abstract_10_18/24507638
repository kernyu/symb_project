OBJECTIVE: To determine the patterns of resistance to first line anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs among a collection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) isolates from 5 provinces of Iran. METHODS: A total of the 6 426 clinical specimens from patients suspected of active TB were collected from March 2010 to June 2012. All specimens were subjected for microscopy and culture tests in the TB centers of studies provinces. Drug susceptibility testing to the first line anti-TB drugs for culture positive MTB was performed on Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) medium using proportion method. RESULTS: Of 6 426 clinical specimens, 261 were culture positive for mycobacteria, of which 252 were MTB and 9 were MOTT (mycobacteria other than tuberculosis). Of 252 MTB isolates, 211 (83.7%) were pan-susceptible and 41 (16.3%) were resistant to at least one drug. Resistance was most common to streptomycin, 30 isolates (12.0%), followed by isoniazid, 20 isolates (8.0%), rifampin, 15 isolates (6.0%) and ethambutol, 14 isolates (5.5%). Sixteen (6.3%) MTB isolates were MDR. A clear evidence of heterogeneity amongst the 5 provinces in the proportions with resistance to one or more drugs was observed [chi(2); = 12.209 (4 degrees of freedom), P values = 0.015 9]. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of drug resistance in this study area underscoring the need for further enforcement of TB control strategies in the Iran. Drug susceptibility testing for all TB cases to provide optimal treatment, establishing advanced diagnostic facilities for rapid detection of MDR-TB and continuous monitoring of drug resistance are recommended for prevention and control of drug-resistant TB.
