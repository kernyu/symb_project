There is currently only limited information on the antimicrobial susceptibility and resistance of Corynebacterium spp., Arcanobacterium spp., and Trueperella pyogenes from animals. The comparability of the data is hampered by the use of different antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods and interpretive criteria. To date, standard broth microdilution methods and clinical breakpoints that are approved by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute and are applicable to Corynebacterium spp., Arcanobacterium spp., and T. pyogenes are available. The lack of species-specific clinical breakpoints for the different animal species reduces the explanatory power of the data. Among the isolates of the three genera, elevated MICs for different classes of antimicrobial agents (e.g., beta-lactams, macrolides, lincosamides, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, phenicols, sulfonamides/diaminopyrimidines, and fluoroquinolones) have been described. The most comprehensive data set is available for T. pyogenes, which also includes information about genes and mutations involved in antimicrobial resistance. In T. pyogenes isolates, the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance genes erm(B) and erm(X) were identified. Tetracycline resistance in T. pyogenes was based on the resistance genes tet(W), tet(Z), and tet(33), whereas the aminoglycoside resistance genes aacC, aadA1, aadA2, aadA5, aadA24, and aadB have been described in T. pyogenes. So far, only single genes conferring either phenicol resistance (cmlA6), trimethoprim resistance (dfrB2a), or beta-lactam resistance (blaP1) are known to occur in T. pyogenes isolates. Various 23S rRNA mutations, including A2058T, A2058G, and G2137C, were identified in macrolide/lincosamide-resistant T. pyogenes.
