WHAT IS KNOWN AND BACKGROUND: For relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), a series of novel agents (thalidomide, bortezomib and lenalidomide) has emerged during the latest decade, but their use in routine clinical practice is not well documented as well as the cost of RRMM. OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to review the therapeutic management of such patients in France and to estimate the associated costs. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study, based on chart reviews, was conducted in French Haematology Departments over the period 2004-2007 and the associated direct costs estimated. RESULTS: One hundred and two patients with a relapse after first-line therapy were selected from five centres. The average follow-up from diagnosis or the date of first relapse to death or to the latest news was respectively 56.25 and 23.53 months. Novel agents were used in 73% of all cases, and in all cases of first relapse. Thalidomide and bortezomib were respectively the most frequently used second-line (57%) and third-line treatments (44%). The average number of lines of treatment received per patient as from first relapse was 2.75 (min 1; max 8) and the mean direct cost per month was estimated at 3130 euro after the first relapse. This cost was represented in greater part by the cost of chemotherapy drugs (66%). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: The use of novel agents such as thalidomide, bortezomib and lenalidomide for RRMM is highly prevalent in France from the first relapse. The associated medical cost is substantial mainly due to the cost of the new agents.
