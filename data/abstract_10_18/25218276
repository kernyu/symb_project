This trial was carried out to investigate the effects of dietary administration of Vitacel((R)), a commercial fermentable fiber, on immune related genes (Lysozyme, TNFalpha and HSP70) expression, innate immune response and resistance of rainbow trout against Aeromonas hydrophila. 120 healthy rainbow trout (81.65 +/- 1.49 g) were distributed in six fiberglass tanks assigned to two treatments. The treatments were feeding rainbow trout with diets supplemented with 0 (control) or 10 g kg(-1) Vitacel((R)) for 45 days. The results revealed that administration of fermentable fiber significantly (P < 0.05) upregulated lysozyme and TNFalpha gene expression. HSP70 gene expression was significantly lower in Vitacel((R)) fed fish at the end of trial (P < 0.05). Furthermore dietary administrations of Vitacel((R)) remarkably elevated rainbow trout innate immune parameters include serum lysozyme, ACH50, bactericidal activity and agglutination antibody titer (P < 0.05). Administration of 10 g kg(-1) Vitacel((R)) significantly increased rainbow trout resistance against A. hydrophila (P < 0.05). The results of present study revealed that dietary Vitacel((R)) can upregulates immune related genes expression and elevates innate immune response and disease resistance of rainbow trout.
