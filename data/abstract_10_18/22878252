A multiplex TaqMan real-time PCR to detect carbapenem-hydrolysing class D beta-lactamases (bla(OXA-23)-like, bla(OXA-24/40)-like, bla(OXA-51)-like and bla(OXA-58)-like genes) was developed and evaluated for early detection of imipenem (IMP) resistance in clinically significant Acinetobacter baumannii isolates. Well-characterized strains of A. baumannii were used as positive controls and non-Acinetobacter strains were used to assess specificity. Analytical sensitivity was quantified by comparison with the number of bacterial c.f.u. Forty of 46 (87 %) clinically significant and IMP-resistant A. baumannii isolates were positive for the bla(OXA-23)-like gene, and one isolate (2 %) was positive for the bla(OXA-58)-like gene. The bla(OXA-24/40)-like gene was not detected in any of the 46 IMP-resistant strains and the bla(OXA-51)-like gene was identified in both IMP-resistant and non-resistant A. baumannii. All 11 non-Acinetobacter bacteria produced a negative result for each of the four bla(OXA) genes. This assay was able to detect as few as 10 c.f.u. per assay. This real-time PCR method demonstrated rapid detection of OXA-like carbapenem resistance in A. baumannii in comparison with phenotypic susceptibility testing methodology. This method could be adapted to a multiplexed single reaction for rapid detection of genes associated with carbapenem resistance in A. baumannii and potentially other clinically significant multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.
