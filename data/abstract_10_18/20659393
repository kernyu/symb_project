The frequency of carbapenem resistance due to class-D beta-lactamases (i.e. oxacillinases) among the world's Enterobacteriaceae is increasing. Recently, in Morocco, two isolates of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae were recovered from the same patient, one harbouring plasmid-encoded bla-(OXA-48) and the other the bla-(OXA-1) gene. This represents the first evidence of bla(OXA-48)-mediated carbapenem-resistance in Enterobacteriaceae in Morocco.
