Eight Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical strains with high-level aminoglycoside resistance were collected from eight hospitals in Sao Paulo State, Brazil, in 2010 and 2011. Three of them produced an RmtD group 16S rRNA methyltransferase, RmtD1 or RmtD2. Five strains were found to produce a novel 16S rRNA methyltransferase, designated RmtG, which shared 57 to 58% amino acid identity with RmtD1 and RmtD2. Seven strains coproduced KPC-2 with or without various CTX-M group extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, while the remaining strain coproduced CTX-M-2.
