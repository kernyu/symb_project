OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of Mycoplasma genitalium in Toronto, Ont; detect mutations associated with macrolide and fluoroquinolone resistance; and describe treatment outcomes. DESIGN: Prospective, cross-sectional study. SETTING: A sexual health clinic in Toronto. PARTICIPANTS: A consecutive sample of men and women attending the sexual health clinic between September 1, 2013, and December 20, 2013. INTERVENTIONS: Participants underwent testing for M genitalium, along with standard sexually transmitted infection screening. All samples that had positive results for M genitalium were tested for mutations associated with resistance to macrolides and fluoroquinolones. Mycoplasma genitalium treatment was based on resistance profile and verified with a test of cure. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Positive results for M genitalium and antibiotic resistance.
