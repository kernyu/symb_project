INTRODUCTION: Tedizolid is indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI). Although tedizolid shares many similar properties with linezolid, another oxazolidinone used to treat ABSSSI, the two antibiotics have several key differences. Areas covered: This review provides a detailed summary of the overall pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and safety of tedizolid for the treatment of ABSSSI. Expert opinion: Compared to other antibiotics used for ABSSSI, tedizolid has several advantages. Tedizolid has a long half-life, allowing for once daily dosing. Tedizolid also has broad spectrum of activity against Gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Coagulase-negative Staphylococci, and Enterococci - including isolates demonstrating resistance to linezolid. It is available in both oral and intravenous formulations, and, has outstanding oral bioavailability, allowing for oral-step down therapy. There is also some evidence that, tedizolid has fewer significant interactions with serotonin reuptake inhibitors or monoamine oxidase inhibitors than linezolid. Finally, thrombocytopenia may occur less often with tedizolid than linezolid. However, these benefits must be weighed against the financial cost of tedizolid and the availability of alternative antibiotic choices.
