The Ragged leaves1 (Rg1) maize mutant frequently develops lesions on leaves, leaf sheaths, and ear bracts. Lesion formation is independent of biotic stress. High-level accumulation of H(2)O(2) revealed by staining Rg1 leaves, with 3',3'-diaminobenzidine and trypan blue, suggested that lesion formation appeared to be due to cell death. Rg1 was initially mapped to an interval around 70.5 Mb in bin 3.04 on the short arm of chromosome 3. Utilizing 15 newly developed markers, Rg1 was delimitated to an interval around 17 kb using 16,356 individuals of a BC1 segregating population. There was only one gene, rp3, predicted in this region according to the B73 genome. Analysis of transcriptome data revealed that 441 genes significantly up-regulated in Rg1 leaves were functionally over-represented. Among those genes, several were involved in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Our results suggested that lesions of Rg1 maize arose probably due to an aberrant rust resistance allele of Rp3, which elicited the accumulation of ROS independent of biotic stress.
