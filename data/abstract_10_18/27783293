Hybrid therapeutic gene FCU1 gene was cloned into a lentiviral expression vector and the therapeutic effect of its expression was studied in three pancreatic cancer cell lines. Expression of FCU1 gene sensitized cells of two of three studied pancreatic cancer cell lines to 5-fluorocytosine. In addition, uracil phosphoribosyl transferase activity of the hybrid FCU1 protein increased sensitivity of transfected cells of all three studied pancreatic cancer cell lines to 5-fluorouracil, a standard chemotherapeutic agent.
