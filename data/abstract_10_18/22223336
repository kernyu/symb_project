Staphyloxanthin, a yellow pigment produced by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), is a virulent factor escaping from the host immune system. A new screening method for inhibitors of staphyloxanthin production by MRSA was established using paper disks. By this screening method, inhibitors of staphyloxanthin production were selected from the natural product library (ca. 300) and from actinomycete culture broths (ca. 1000). From the natural product library, four known inhibitors of lipid metabolism, cerulenin, dihydrobisvertinol, xanthohumol and zaragozic acid, were found to inhibit staphyloxanthin production; however, typical antibiotics used clinically, including vancomycin, had no effect on staphyloxanthin production. From actinomycete culture broths, two known anthraquinones, 6-deoxy-8-O-methylrabelomycin and tetrangomycin, were found to inhibit staphyloxanthin production by MRSA in the paper disk assay. These results suggested that this screening method is useful and effective to find compounds targeting staphyloxanthin production, leading to a new type of chemotherapeutics against MRSA infection.
