Cytomegalovirus resistance to antivirals is a major problem in transplant recipients. We evaluated the impact of five mutations (A594V, L595F, and E655K in the UL97 gene and V526L and E756K in the UL54 gene), detected in a blood sample from a stem cell transplant recipient, on drug susceptibilities and replicative capacities of recombinant viruses.
