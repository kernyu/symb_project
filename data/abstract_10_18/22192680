We analysed the 12-week virological response to protease inhibitor (PI) or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) therapy in 1108 patients carrying B or non-B human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 subtypes with matched resistance mutation patterns. Response rates were not significantly different for non-B and B subtypes stratified for treatment status (51.5% vs. 41.5% in naive patients; 46.7% vs. 38.7% in experienced patients) or regimens (46.9% vs. 39.7% with PI; 56.7% vs. 40% with NNRTI). No difference in response was detected in patients harbouring B and non-B subtypes with any resistance profile. Further studies are advisable to fully test this approach on larger datasets.
