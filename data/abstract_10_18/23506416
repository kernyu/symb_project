BACKGROUND: Insulin resistance (IR) is a key factor in the development of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C virus infection. Little is known about the impact of viral clearance on IR. AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the impact of viral clearance on IR. METHODS: Eighty-six patients treated according to standard clinical practice at an Australian teaching hospital between 2003 and 2007 were prospectively studied. Demographic, biochemical and histological data were collected. RESULTS: The mean pretreatment homeostatic model assessment-IR (HOMA-IR) was similar in the sustained virological response (SVR) and non-SVR groups (2.7 +/- 0.5 and 2.8 +/- 0.4, respectively), and both values were consistent with significant IR. There was a significant improvement in HOMA-IR (from 3.0 +/- 1.0 to 2.2 +/- 0.5, P = 0.04) at the end of treatment in the SVR group only. This trended towards significance at 6 months post-treatment. Multiple regression analysis found improvement in both gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and alanine aminotransferase predicted improvement in HOMA-IR when controlled for other potential factors (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Hepatitis C virus clearance is associated with improvement in IR. Although baseline hepatic fibrosis is a predictor of IR, changes in IR appear to be independent of changes in liver fibrosis. Treatment-related improvement in gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and alanine aminotransferase seen with improved IR may be a possible marker of reduction of hepatic oxidative stress.
