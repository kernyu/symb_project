UNLABELLED: The aim of this study was to determine the characteristics of carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) strains and 5-year changes in resistance in a tertiary university hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 90 and 101 randomly selected P. aeruginosa strains serotyped in 2003 and 2008, respectively. The standardized disk diffusion test and E-test were used to determine resistance to antibiotics. P. aeruginosa strains were considered to have high-level resistance if a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for imipenem or meropenem was >32 microg/mL. To identify serogroups, sera containing specific antibodies against O group antigens of P. aeruginosa were used. P. aeruginosa isolates resistant to imipenem or/and meropenem were screened for metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) production by using the MBL E-test. RESULTS: Comparison of the changes in resistance of P. aeruginosa strains to carbapenems within the 5-year period revealed that the level of resistance to imipenem increased. In 2003, 53.3% of P. aeruginosa strains were found to be highly resistant to imipenem, while in 2008, this percentage increased to 87.8% (P=0.01). The prevalence of MBL-producing strains increased from 15.8% in 2003 to 61.9% in 2008 (P<0.001). In 2003 and 2008, carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa strains were more often resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin than carbapenem-sensitive strains. In 2008, carbapenem-resistant strains additionally were more often resistant to ceftazidime, cefepime, aztreonam, piperacillin, and amikacin than carbapenem-sensitive strains. MBL-producing P. aeruginosa strains belonged more often to the O:11 serogroup than MBL-non-producing strains (51.7% vs. 34.3%, P<0.05). A greater percentage of non-MBL-producing strains had low MICs against ciprofloxacin and amikacin as compared with MBL-producing strains. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study emphasize the need to restrict the spread of O:11 serogroup P. aeruginosa strains and usage of carbapenems to treat infections with P. aeruginosa in the intensive care units of our hospital.
