The influence of RNA polymerase (rif) mutations on the yield of capsular exopolysaccharide--colanic acid (CA) of Escherichia coli K-12 lon strain was studied. Five colanic acid isogenic producing strains were created by transduction transfer of rif alleles possessing pleiotropic effects. The obtained isogenic strains differed by specific growth rate, size and mucoidness of colonies, the dependence of growth on the medium composition and cultivation temperature, as well as by the adsorption rate of virulent bacteriophage M59, specifically lysing E. coli cells producing CA. Direct correlation between the yield of exopolysaccharides, growth rate and adsorption of bacteriophage M59 was revealed. Among rif recombinants strain AH203, which synthesized twice as much CA compared with the parental strain in submerged cultivation was selected.
