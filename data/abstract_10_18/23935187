LEC-1 is a major galectin in Caenorhabditis elegans and contains two carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs), N-CRD and C-CRD. To determine the role of LEC-1, we examined the phenotypes of a mutant C. elegans strain lacking lec-1. We observed negligible differences in embryogenesis, morphogenesis and egg laying at 20 degrees C between the mutant and the wild-type. Furthermore, the life spans of the mutant and the wild-type were equivalent at either 20 degrees C or 25 degrees C. However, the lec-1 mutant showed a greater susceptibility to H2O2 and paraquat than the wild-type. This result suggests an increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, with the phenotypes being similar to those of lec-10 deletion mutants as previously described. To understand the molecular mechanism underlying this phenotype, C. elegans proteins bound by either the LEC-1 N-CRD or C-CRD were isolated and identified using a nano liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry technique. MIG-6 was identified as a major binding partner of LEC-1 with both N- and C-CRD. From these results and previous reports, we speculate that interaction of LEC-1 and MIG-6 in the pharynx may affect susceptibility to paraquat and that LEC-10 has different functions from LEC-1 in regulating H2O2 and paraquat resistance in the intestine.
