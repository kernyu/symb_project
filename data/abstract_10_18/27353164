There is growing global recognition that the continued emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria poses a serious threat to human health. Action plans released by the World Health Organization and governments of the UK and USA in particular recognize that discovering new antibiotics, particularly those with new modes of action, is one essential element required to avert future catastrophic pandemics. This review lists the 30 antibiotics and two beta-lactamase/beta-lactam combinations first launched since 2000, and analyzes in depth seven new antibiotics and two new beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations launched since 2013. The development status, mode of action, spectra of activity and genesis (natural product, natural product-derived, synthetic or protein/mammalian peptide) of the 37 compounds and six beta-lactamase/beta-lactam combinations being evaluated in clinical trials between 2013 and 2015 are discussed. Compounds discontinued from clinical development since 2013 and new antibacterial pharmacophores are also reviewed.
