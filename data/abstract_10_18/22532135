Acinetobacter baumannii plays an increasing role in the pathogenesis of infections in humans. The bacilli are frequently isolated from patients treated in intensive care units. A growing resistance to antibiotics is leading to the emergence of strains that are multidrug-resistant and resistant to all available agents. The objective of this study was to assess susceptibility to antibiotics and to determine the presence and current level of the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and attempt to isolate the Acinetobacter baumannii strain carrying the blaPER gene. A total of 51 strains of A. baumannii identified by phenotypic features were examined. That the strains belonged to the species was confirmed by the presence of the blaOXA-51-like; gene. A broth microdilution method was used for antibacterial susceptibility testing. The occurrence of ESBLs was determined using phenotypic double-disk synergy tests. The PCR technique was used to confirm the presence of the blaPER-1; gene encoding ESBL. The most active antibiotics were meropenem, cefepime and ampicillin/sulbactam, with susceptibility shown by 76.5%, 60.8% and 56.9% of the strains, respectively. The strains exhibited the highest resistance (&gt; 75%) to piperacillin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime. Phenotypic tests revealed ESBL mechanism of resistance in approximately 20% of Acinetobacter baumannii isolates. However, the PCR technique did not confirm the presence of the blaPER-1; gene in any of the Acinetobacter baumannii strains examined in our hospital. Acinetobacter baumannii strains demonstrate considerable resistance to many groups of antibiotics. Our findings indicate the involvement of enzymes belonging to families other than PER beta-lactamase in resistance to beta-lactams in A. baumannii.
