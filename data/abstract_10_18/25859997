OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate rapid, molecular-based drug susceptibility testing (DST) for extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), we assembled a phenotypically and genotypically diverse collection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from patients evaluated for drug resistance in four high-burden countries. METHODS: M. tuberculosis isolates from India (n = 111), Moldova (n = 90), the Philippines (n = 96), and South Africa (n = 103) were selected from existing regional and national repositories to maximize phenotypic diversity for resistance to isoniazid, rifampin (RMP), moxifloxacin, ofloxacin, amikacin, kanamycin, and capreomycin. MGIT 960 was performed on viable isolates in one laboratory using standardized procedures and drug concentrations. Genetic diversity within drug resistance phenotypes was assessed. RESULTS: Nineteen distinct phenotypes were observed among 400 isolates with complete DST results. Diversity was greatest in the Philippines (14 phenotypes), and least in South Africa (9 phenotypes). Nearly all phenotypes included multiple genotypes. All sites provided isolates resistant to injectables but susceptible to fluoroquinolones. Many patients were taking drugs to which their disease was resistant. DISCUSSION: Diverse phenotypes for XDR-TB-defining drugs, including resistance to fluoroquinolones and/or injectable drugs in RMP-susceptible isolates, indicate that RMP susceptibility does not ensure effectiveness of a standard four-drug regimen. Rapid, low-cost DST assays for first- and second-line drugs are thus needed.
