Non-typhi Salmonella are responsible for severe invasive infections in children with sickle cell disease, with osteoarticular locations that can affect short- and long-term outcomes. We describe the cases of 2 children with sickle cell disease who presented paucisymptomatic Salmonella osteoarticular infections on returning from North Africa. Progression was favorable in both cases after appropriate systemic antibiotic therapy, although one Salmonella was multidrug-resistant. Invasive salmonellosis remains rare in France, but, because of its severity, it should be suspected in any patient with sickle cell disease presenting fever, especially in the context of recent trips in Africa countries. Early clinical diagnosis is essential to start appropriate empirical treatment without waiting for bacteriological results.
