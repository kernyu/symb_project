We performed bedaquiline broth microdilution susceptibility testing using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines on 103 respiratory isolates of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), including multidrug-resistant isolates. Approximately 90% of isolates had bedaquiline MICs of </=0.008 mug/ml, and 102/103 isolates had MICs of </=0.015 mug/ml. Bedaquiline has excellent potential for use in patients with MAC infections, although for reasons of its metabolism by the cytochrome P450 system, it should not be given with rifampin.
