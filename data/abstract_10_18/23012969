To deeply study the molecular mechanism of infection and reproduction of malaria parasites, this review began with co-relationship between toll like receptors (TLRs) and the parasites, further discussed how the parasites were recognized by TLRs and activated downstream inflammation reactions when the mechanical barrier of host was broken through. Some large molecules involved into the process had the potential to be novel drug targets.
