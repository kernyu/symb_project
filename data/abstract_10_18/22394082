A recent discussion meeting convened by the Medicines for Malaria Venture examined how best to manage the discovery and preclinical pipeline to achieve novel combination therapies which would address the key clinical needs in malaria. It became clear that dose optimisation of components within combination therapy was a key issue in achieving antimalarial efficacy and for preserving that efficacy against parasite resistance emergence. This paper outlines some of the specific issues in malaria that cause dose-ranging and dose-optimisation studies to be particularly challenging and discusses the potential of factorial study design to address such challenges.
