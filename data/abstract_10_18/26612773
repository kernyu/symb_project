This document describes the recommendations of a group of scientific societies concerning the first-line therapeutic approach to paediatric tuberculosis (TB). The treatment of pulmonary TB should be based on the existence of parenchymal involvement and the risk of antibiotic resistance. The treatment of extra-pulmonary TB is based on the regimens used for severe pulmonary TB. The administration of corticosteroids is recommended only in cases of miliary TB, tuberculous meningitis and tuberculous pericarditis. Vitamin B6 may be indicated in the case of isoniazid-treated TB in breastfeeding infants, severely malnourished subjects, or patients with other diseases at high risk of vitamin deficiency. Once having started treatment, children with TB should be carefully followed up in order to evaluate compliance, the response to treatment, the need for treatment changes, and the presence of drug-related adverse events. Primary care paediatricians can support reference centres in providing family healthcare education and encouraging treatment compliance.
