Resistance to anthelmintic drugs, particularly to the widely used benzimidazoles (BZs) and macrocyclic lactones (MLs) is an increasing problem in cattle industries worldwide. Reliable methods for the assessment of anthelmintic efficacy in the field are required in order to react before resistance becomes an obvious problem on individual properties. The ability of the Egg Hatch Assay (EHA) and the Larval Migration Inhibition Assay (LMIA) to detect anthelmintic resistance under field conditions was evaluated on cattle farms in Northern Germany. As published previously Faecal Egg Count Reduction Test (FECRT) was performed using oral albendazole (Valbazen(R)) or injectable ivermectin (Ivomec(R)). Herein the FECRT results described earlier were compared with data from EHAs or LMIAs, respectively, performed with eggs from fresh faeces or larvae from faecal cultures of the tested animals before and after treatment. The obtained EC(50) values allowed the assessment of efficacy of albendazole and ivermectin on farm level. The results of the FECRTs and the results of both in vitro assays were comparable. In comparison to the FECRT the in vitro assays are less time, labour and cost intensive and are able to assess the susceptibility status of a worm population without treatment. Therefore both are beneficial alternatives for the reliable detection of reduced efficacy of these two drug classes on farms.
