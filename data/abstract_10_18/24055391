Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has emerged as a pathogen associated with community-acquired infections worldwide. We report the spectrum of community-acquired S. aureus infections and compare the patients infected with methicillin-susceptible or methicillin-resistant strains among patients aged <20 years. Overall, 90 cases of community-acquired S. aureus were detected in an 11-year period. Clinical and microbiological data were registered. Fifty-nine (66%) patients were male and the median age was two years. The majority (87%) of the patients were hospitalized and chronic underlying illnesses were detected in 27 (30%) cases. Overall, 34 (37.8%) patients had skin/soft tissue infections and 56 (62.2%) patients had deep-seated infection. Four (5.1%) patients were transferred to the intensive care unit and two (2.6%) died. Complications were detected in 17 (18.9%) cases, such as pleural effusion (41.2%), osteomyelitis (23.5%), and sepsis (17.6%). Six (6.7%) methicillin-resistant strains were detected. Patients infected with methicillin-susceptible or methicillin-resistant strains had similar baseline characteristics and treatment outcomes. Approximately 93% of the cases received systemic antibiotics, out of which 59 (65.5%) used oxacillin or cefalotin. Both methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains resulted in morbidity and death among children in this setting where methicillin-resistant strains are infrequent.
