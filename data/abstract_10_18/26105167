Tedizolid phosphate is the second commercially available oxazolidinone antibiotic, although the first one in class that is dosed once daily. It is a prodrug that is rapidly converted to the active compound tedizolid. Tedizolid has activity against a wide range of gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. It is approved to treat acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs). In 2 randomized controlled phase 3 trials, 6 days of tedizolid (200 mg once daily) has been proven to be noninferior to 10 days of linezolid (600 mg twice daily). These 2 ABSSSI studies have positioned tedizolid among the growing armamentarium of newer, novel, anti-gram-positive agents. Tedizolid appears to differ from linezolid in the incidence of gastrointestinal and hematologic side effects and appears to lack drug interactions with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Conditions other than ABSSSI are currently being evaluated in clinical studies.
