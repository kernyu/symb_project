The rapid emergence of drug-resistant malaria parasites during the course of an infection remains a major challenge for providing accurate treatment guidelines. This is particularly important in cases of malaria treatment failure. Using a previously well-characterized case of malaria treatment failure, we show the utility of using next-generation sequencing for early detection of the rise and selection of a previously reported atovaquone-proguanil (malarone) drug resistance-associated mutation.
