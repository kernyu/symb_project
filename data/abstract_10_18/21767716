CHROMagar KPC was evaluated with 53 carbapenem-nonsusceptible strains. KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae grew efficiently and yielded metallic blue colonies (100% sensitivity). Poor or no growth or atypical colony color were evident with KPC-producing Escherichia coli (71.4% sensitivity) and ertapenem-resistant KPC-nonproducing K. pneumoniae (72.7% sensitivity). CHROMagar KPC appears applicable for processing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae surveillance specimens, but its performance might possibly be suboptimal in the presence of KPC-negative ertapenem-resistant strains or for detection of KPC-producing E. coli.
