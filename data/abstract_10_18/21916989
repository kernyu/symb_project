BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The eradication rate of proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-based triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection has decreased, mainly due to increasing antibiotic resistance, especially against clarithromycin. It has been reported that a 10-day sequential strategy can produce good outcomes. The aim of this prospective study was to assess the efficacy of sequential therapy as the first-line treatment for the eradication of H. pylori in Korea. METHODS: A total of 116 patients with proven H. pylori infection received 10-day sequential therapy (20 mg rabeprazole and 1 g amoxicillin, twice daily for the first 5 days, followed by 20 mg rabeprazole, 500 mg clarithromycin, and 500 mg metronidazole, twice daily for the remaining 5 days); 130 patients received 7-day triple therapy (20 mg rabeprazole, 500 mg clarithromycin, and 1 g amoxicillin, twice daily for 7 days). Eradication was evaluated by the (13) C-urea breath test, 4 weeks after the completion of treatment. Compliance and adverse events were assessed. RESULTS: The eradication rates of 10-day sequential therapy and PPI-based triple therapy were 79.3% (92/116) and 63% (82/130) by intention-to-treat analysis, respectively (P = 0.005), and 81.9% (91/111) and 64.5% (82/127) by per protocol analysis, respectively (P = 0.003). Mild adverse events occurred in both therapy groups (27.5% vs 23.8%), but both treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: The eradication rate of the 10-day sequential therapy regimen was significantly higher than that of PPI-based triple therapy in the Korean population. Ten-day sequential therapy might be effective as a first-line treatment for H. pylori infection in Korea.
