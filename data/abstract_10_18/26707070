Comparison of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) isolates responsible for bone and joint infection (BJI, n=73) and nasal colonization (n=57) revealed similar prevalence of beta-lactamase (blaZ) type A production, associated with cefazolin hydrolysis, suggesting that blaZ type A-carrying MSSA isolates implicated in postoperative BJI are not selected by cefazolin prophylaxis.
