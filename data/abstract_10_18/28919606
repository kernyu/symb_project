This cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out to analyse the current trends of using antimicrobials at orthopaedics department in different surgical procedures and observe the antimicrobial sensitivity pattern of infective organisms in postoperative wound infection cases at the department of Orthopaedics, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital with collaboration of department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics in Mymensingh Medical College, Mymensingh from January 2016 to December 2016. Among 253 orthopaedics surgical cases Penicillins, Cephalosporins, and Aminoglycoside group were commonly prescribed antimicrobials that had been use postoperatively in most of the Orthopaedics cases. Rate of occurring postoperative wound infection was 18.58%. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (36.17%) was the predominant microorganisms in our study followed by Klebsiellae (12.77%), Proteus (10.64%), Escherichia coli and (6.38%) Enterococcus (4.25%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibited sensitivities to Gentamicin (35.29%), Amikacin (35.29%). Good sensitivities patterns for Klebsiellae in our study were shown to Imipenam (100%), Gentamicin (20%). Sensitivity patterns for Proteus in our study were shown to Imipenam (80%), Gentamicin (20%). Enterococcus in our study showed good sensitivities against Imipenam (100%), Linezolid (100%). Cephalosporin generation showed more resistance.
