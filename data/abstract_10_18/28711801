Miscanthusxgiganteus is a perennial rhizomatous grass which is used as a biofuel crop. Due to its high yields, low production costs, resistance to low temperatures, low soil requirements and, above all, high cellulose content, miscanthus can be a useful resource for ethanol production. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of two fertilization regimes (sewage sludge/mineral NPK) during miscanthus cultivation on the chemical composition of biomass, the content of major lignocellulosic factions and the effectiveness of miscanthus conversion to bioethanol. The results indicate that fertilization treatments influenced biomass yield and the content of major lignocellulosic fractions. Bioethanol production was higher when hydrolysis and fermentation processes were conducted separately than when saccharification and fermentation were conducted simultaneously. Ethanol production increased by 30% and 40% in response to sewage sludge and NPK (equivalent nitrogen content=160kgN/ha) fertilization, respectively, in comparison with unfertilized crops.
