SUMMARY Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus; GBS) isolates (n = 150) from infants with invasive infections between 2006 and 2011 were analysed for capsular serotype, multilocus sequence type, and antibiotic susceptibility. In cases with late-onset disease (n = 115), primary meningitis was predominant (62.6%), but represented only 39.1% in cases with early-onset disease (n = 23). The most common serotype was III (58.7%), followed by Ia (21.3%) and Ib (12.7%). Sequence types (STs) of serotype III strains included ST17 (50.0%), ST19 (26.1%), ST335 (18.2%), ST27 (4.5%), and ST1 (1.1%). Predominant STs of serotypes Ia and Ib were ST23 (81.3%) and ST10 (84.2%), respectively. No penicillin-resistant strains were detected, but 22.0% of strains had mef(A/E), erm(A), or erm(B) genes, which mediate macrolide resistance. A new ST335, possessing an mef(A/E) gene belonging to clonal complex 19 gradually increased in frequency. Improved prevention of invasive GBS infections in infants requires timely identification, and ultimately vaccine development.
