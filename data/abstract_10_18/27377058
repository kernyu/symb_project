We describe a novel class of amphiphiles with squaramide moiety as a phosphate bioisostere. Most synthesized squaramide-based amphiphiles have the favorable physicochemical properties of lipids, such as: formation of stable liposomes or giant unilamellar vesicles in aqueous solution, high phase-transition temperature, low vesicle leakage and phospholipase resistance properties.
