The first and second line drugs used for the treatment of tuberculosis are now becoming ineffective due to emergence of resistant strains. Efflux pump provokes resistance in mycobacterium and hence could be explored as a new target for the discovery of anti-TB agents. In search of efflux pump inhibitors, MIC and modulation factor of phenylpropanoids isolated from A. galanga rhizome were determined prior to the accumulation and efflux assay. Phenylpropanoid compounds viz. 1'-S-1'-acetoxychavicol acetate, trans-p-coumaryl diacetate and 1'-S-1'-acetoxyeugenol acetate were found to be potent modulators and decreased the MIC of ethidium bromide by 64 fold at the concentration of 2.5, 6.25 and 5.0 mg/L respectively. 1'-S-1'-acetoxyeugenol acetate enhanced the accumulation and inhibited the efflux of EtBr in Mycobacterium smegmatis mc(2) 155 cells.
