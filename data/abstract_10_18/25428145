One unreported case of extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi was identified, whole-genome sequence typed, among other analyses, and compared to other available genomes of S. Typhi. The reported strain was similar to a previously published strain harboring blaSHV-12 from the Philippines and likely part of an undetected outbreak, the first of ESBL-producing S. Typhi.
