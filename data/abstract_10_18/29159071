Cupriavidus gilardii was first identified as an aerobic, gram-negative, glucose-nonfermenting rod. C. gilardii has been characterized as an organism with low pathogenicity that causes opportunistic infections and few case reports of infection caused by this organism previously. We encountered the first case of bloodstream infection caused in China by C. gilardii in a 87-year old man without obvious immunodeficiency. The isolate were identified as C. gilardii by 16S rRNA sequencing. The infected patient was treated according to the laboratory's antibiogram of this strain. Similar to the case report in Japan, this is the second report of an infection caused by this organism without obvious immunodeficiency, suggesting that C. gilardii exerts its pathogenicity both in immunodeficient and immunocompetent hosts.
