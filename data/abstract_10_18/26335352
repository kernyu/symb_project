BACKGROUND: In this study we describe the clinical and molecular characteristics of an outbreak due to carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-KP) producing CTX-M-15 and OXA-48 carbapenemase. Isogenic strains, carbapenem-susceptible K. pneumoniae (CS-KP) producing CTX-M-15, were also involved in the outbreak. RESULTS: From October 2010 to December 2012 a total of 62 CR-KP and 23 CS-KP were isolated from clinical samples of 42 patients (22 had resistant isolates, 14 had susceptible isolates, and 6 had both CR and CS isolates). All patients had underlying diseases and 17 of them (14 patients with CR-KP and 3 with CS-KP) had received carbapenems previously. The range of carbapenem MICs for total isolates were: imipenem: 2 to >32 mug/ml vs. <2 mug/ml; meropenem: 4 to >32 mug/ml vs. <2 mug/ml; and ertapenem: 8 to >32 mug/ml vs. <2 mug/ml. All the isolates were also resistant to gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and cotrimoxazole. Both types of isolates shared a common PFGE pattern associated with the multilocus sequence type 101 (ST101). The bla CTX-M-15 gene was detected in all the isolates, whereas the bla OXA-48 gene was only detected in CR-KP isolates on a 70 kb plasmid. CONCLUSIONS: The clonal spread of K. pneumoniae ST101 expressing the OXA-48 and CTX-M-15 beta-lactamases was the cause of an outbreak of CR-KP infections. CTX-M-15-producing isolates lacking the bla OXA-48 gene coexisted during the outbreak.
