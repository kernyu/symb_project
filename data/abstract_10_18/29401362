The evolution and diversification of bacterial pathogens within human hosts represent potential barriers to the diagnosis and treatment of life-threatening infections. Tremendous genetic and phenotypic diversity is characteristic of host adaptation in strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa that infect the airways of individuals with chronic lung diseases and prove to be extremely difficult to eradicate. In this MiniReview, we examine recent advances in understanding within-host diversity and antimicrobial resistance in P. aeruginosa populations from the lower airways of individuals with the fatal genetic disease cystic fibrosis and the potential impacts that this diversity may have on detecting and interpreting antimicrobial susceptibility within these populations.
