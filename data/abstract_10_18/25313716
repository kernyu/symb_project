INTRODUCTION: There is a continuous need for next-generation non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs) with different resistance profiles, improved safety, excellent tolerability, and favorable physicochemical properties. AREAS COVERED: In this review we intend to narrate a general and cutting-edge overview of current state of NNRTI patents during the 2011-2014 (June) period and future perspectives. Particular focus is placed on the highlighting of some emerging medicinal chemistry principles and insights in the discovery and development of NNRTIs. EXPERT OPINION: The development of effective NNRTIs is moving on from trial-and-error approaches to sophisticated subconscious strategies. Several newly emerging structure-based virtual screening methodologies (such as Monte Carlo free energy perturbation calculations) or new drug design insights, such as taking full use of the specific noncovalent reverse transcriptase/NNRTIs interactions, stereochemical diversity-oriented conformational restriction, novel strategies to enhance solubility and early absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) assessment, will continue to evolve to complement the classical NNRTIs discovery approaches (structure-based core-refining and substituents-decorating).
