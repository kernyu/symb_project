The simple method to detect mutations conferring resistant to dapsone, rifampicin, and quinolone was exploited in Mycobacterium. leprae on the basis of reverse DNA hybridization with capture probe fixed to the glass slide. Mutations were discriminated by a series of oligonucleotide probes corresponding to each mutation in the folP1, rpoB, and gyrA genes of M. leprae. The method was transferred to two laboratories in developing countries. The results obtained with the kit at those laboratories were highly concordant with results of sequencing. The method is feasible for the testing by local person in areas with high prevalence of leprosy.
