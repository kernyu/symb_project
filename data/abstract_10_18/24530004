Ten natural compounds are successfully identified as falcipain-2 (FP-2) inhibitors from our in-house natural products database using structure-based virtual screening, which show moderate inhibitory activities against FP-2 with IC50 values ranging from 3.18 to 68.19 muM. While one of the inhibitors (compound 5) also exhibits in vitro antiplasmodial activity against chloroquine sensitive strain (3D7) and chloroquine resistant strain (Dd2) of Plasmodium falciparum in the micromolar range (IC50s=5.54 muM and 4.05 muM against 3D7 cells and Dd2 cells, respectively). Furthermore, the predicted binding poses are analyzed to explain the structure-activity relationships, which will be helpful for further structural modifications.
