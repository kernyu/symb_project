Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is recognized as the causative of several gastroduodenal disorders. The discovery of H. pylori revolutionized the treatment for ulcus pepticum. Antibiotics combined with proton pump inhibitors or bismuth have been effective in the treatment of H. pylori infections, but there is an emerging problem with H. pylori resistance against the most frequently used antibiotics, which substantially impairs the treatment of H. pylori-associated disorders. In this article the focus is on the prevalence of H. pylori resistance, its clinical implications and the molecular mechanisms behind resistance development.
