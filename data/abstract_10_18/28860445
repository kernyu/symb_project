We report a case of TNBC treated effectively with a platinum-based regimen after developing resistance to anthracycline and taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy(NAC). A 59-year-old woman with a right breast mass and high fever visited our clinic and was diagnosed as having inflammatory triple negative breast cancer(iTNBC). She was treated with NAC of docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide(TAC)using pegfilgrastim. After 5 courses of TAC, the therapy failed and the disease progressed. Thus, a combination regimen of gemcitabine and carboplatin(GC)was administered. The treatment was successful, and the patient underwent a curative operation after 6 courses of the GC therapy.
