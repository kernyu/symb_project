We studied as hydrogen peroxide, lactic acid, or surfactants from clinical isolates of vaginal lactobacilli and cell-free supernatants from probiotic strain LCR35 can influence on the sensitivity of opportunistic bacteria to antibiotics. We found that the most effective in increasing sensitivity to antibiotics were hydrogen peroxide and surfactants or their combination but no lactic acid. In some cases, the effect of the composition of hydrogen peroxide and surfactants was clearly higher than the sum of effects of these substances alone. With using of the supernatant of LCR35 was shown that the combination of surfactant and lactate has greater effect compared with surfactants alone. In concluding, metabolites of vaginal lactobacilli are suitable for the role of "antibiotic assistants" and it can help solve the problems the antibiotic resistance.
