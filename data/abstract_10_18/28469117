BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Neonatal sepsis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the pediatric age group in spite of several attempts at mitigating its effects. This article determines the prevalence of neonatal sepsis and the pathogens responsible for sepsis as well as risk factors and outcome at the Babcock University Teaching Hospital. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of laboratory records of consecutive babies delivered within and outside our hospital suspected of having sepsis over a 1-year period. RESULTS: The isolation rate was 34% from 100 neonates with the predominant pathogens being coagulase-negative staphylococci (CONS), Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The risk factors for sepsis were age <3 days (P = 0.03) and prematurity (P < 0.001). The mortality rate was 12% with risk factors for mortality being birth weight <2500 g (P = 0.005), prematurity (P = 0.036), premature rupture of membranes (P = 0.007), and delivery outside a tertiary hospital (P = 0.007). Meropenem, ciprofloxacin, and amikacin showed the highest rates of in vitro efficacy. CONCLUSION: We highlight the prevalent pathogens in our local facility to be a combination of CONS, S. aureus, and K. pneumoniae with susceptibility patterns showing meropenem, ciprofloxacin, and amikacin to be our most effective antimicrobials in vitro.
