Staphylococcus aureus is a versatile bacterium, which can infect or colonize a variety of host species. The objective of this study was to characterize S. aureus isolates recovered from nasal swabs of 167 healthy ewes sampled from 12 farms in different areas of Tunisia during the period of 2014-2015. Genetic lineages, virulence factors and antibiotic resistance mechanisms were determined for recovered isolates. S. aureus was detected in 45 out of 167 tested samples (26.9%). All isolates were methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) and the majority of them were susceptible to tested antibiotics with few exceptions (% of resistance): penicillin (8.8), ciprofloxacin (4.4), and tobramycin or tetracycline (2.2, each). Twelve different spa types were detected (t15098, t15099, t1773, t3576, t1534, t5428, t3750, t5970 t254, t2883, t127 and t933), two of them were new (t15098 and t15099). S. aureus isolates were ascribed to agrI (n=23), agrII (n=1) and agrIII (n=20), and one was non-typeable. According to the sequence-type (ST) determined and/or the spa-type detected, the 45S. aureus isolates were assigned to six clonal complexes, with CC522 (44.4%) and CC130 (37.7%) being the most common lineages. Twenty-one (46.6%) and two (4.2%) isolates harbored the tst and eta genes encoding TSST-1 and ETA, respectively. In conclusion, nares of healthy ewes could be a reservoir of MSSA CC522 and CC130, lineages associated with TSST-1 and ETA that might represent a risk to human health.
