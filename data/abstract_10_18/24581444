The yeast three-hybrid system has been applied to known protein-RNA interactions for a variety of purposes. For instance, protein and RNA mutants with altered or relaxed binding specificities can be identified. Mutant RNAs can also be analyzed to better understand RNA-binding specificity of a specific protein. Furthermore, this system complements other biochemical techniques, for example, SELEX, co-immunoprecipitation and cross-linking experiments (see UV crosslinking of interacting RNA and protein in cultured cells and PAR-CLIP (Photoactivatable Ribonucleoside-Enhanced Crosslinking and Immunoprecipitation): a step-by-step protocol to the transcriptome-wide identification of binding sites of RNA-binding proteins).
