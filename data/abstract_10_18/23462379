Ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) either single-chain (type 1) or two-chain (type 2) are frequent in plants, often in multiple forms. They are RNA N-glycosidases, have antiviral, antifungal and insecticidal activity. Their expression in plants is increased under stressful conditions. They are investigated for practical applications in medicine and in agriculture. In medicine, RIPs have been linked to, or fused with, appropriate antibodies or other carriers to form "immunotoxins" or other conjugates specifically toxic to the cells target of the carrier, with the aim of eliminating malignant or other undesired cells. In agriculture, it has been observed that an enhanced expression of RIPs confers to plants an increased resistance to viruses, fungi, insects, and also to drought and salinity.
