Here we present the findings of a study where 598 isolates of Escherichia coli (351 derived from seawater; 247 derived from the Venus clam, Circenita callipyga) were obtained from Kuwait's marine environment. Isolates were screened for their potential resistance to an array of 23 commonly deployed frontline antibiotics. Results demonstrate the resistant was widespread across all sites with high-levels of resistance (seawater: summer 89-64%; winter 90-57% and biota: summer 77%; winter 88%) observed to at least 1 of the 23 antibiotics tested. Resistance to Ampicillin was by far the most widely observed profile in seawater and biota across both summer and winter seasons, with 55.9 to 70.9% isolates displaying resistance to this antibiotic. This study demonstrates the potential of AMR screening to be used in Kuwait to detect issues related to water quality and the consequences it may pose for human health.
