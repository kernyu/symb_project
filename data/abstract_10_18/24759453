The introduction of HAART has represented a major advance in the care of people with HIV. By markedly increasing life expectancy, HAART has significantly changed the pattern of HIV infection in developed countries, the "graying" of the HIV-infected population being a powerful testament to its success. However, this has presented physicians with new challenges relating to the care of older patients with HIV, many of whom exhibit a "frailty syndrome" associated with increased comorbidity and chronic low-grade inflammation in a process which has recently been termed "inflammaging". This paper reviews the pattern of morbidity seen in older HIV-infected patients and examines the effects, both beneficial and deleterious, of antiretroviral therapy. The efficacy and tolerability of antiretroviral therapy is of particular importance in older patients, given the likelihood that increased frailty may magnify the consequences both of suboptimal viral suppression and of toxicity, and in view of the complications that may arise from the presence of comorbidities and resultant polypharmacy. The challenge is to maximize antiviral efficacy and minimize toxicity, while taking into account the often complex web of comorbidities that may be present in these patients. This challenge is being met through the refinement of existing antiretroviral therapy regimens, the development of new agents, and a growing focus on a more holistic approach to care, which acknowledges the importance of the overall "health picture" and of good communication and cooperation between treating physicians and patients.
