In this paper we summarize and discuss the problem of the antibiotic resistance issue and potential intervention strategies in low- and middle-income countries (LMILs). In Europe and North America surveillance data are available and research networks are active, however, these are still largely lacking in LMILs. In recent years some initiatives have been set up for LMIL, such as 'Action on Antibiotic Resistance' (ReACT) and the 'Global Antibiotic Resistance Partnership' (GARP). While better data on antibiotic resistance and its causes in LMILs are needed, there is a more urgent need for affordable interventions to turn the tide. Unlike programs aimed at combatting bacterial antibiotic resistance, there are already strong global programs to tackle resistance in HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. We should learn from these programs to improve efforts to control and treat resistant bacterial infections.
