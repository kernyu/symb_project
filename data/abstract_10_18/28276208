This study aims to evaluate Helicobacter pylori with clarithromycin resistant genotypes in Manisa region, Turkey. Two hundred patients, who received diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection histopathologically, were included. The sex, age and endoscopy indications of the patients were recorded. Polymerase chain reaction method was applied to determine the clarithromycin resistance rate and resistance genotypes at the histologic sections prepared from gastric biopsies that had been embedded in paraffin after fixation by formalin. Helicobacter pylori resistance to clarithromycin was found in 19/200 (9.5%) patients. 10/19 (52.6%) of these clarithromycin-resistant patients had A2143G mutation and 9/19 (47.4%) had A2142G mutation. A2142C mutation on 23S rRNA gene was not detected for any of the patients. Clarithromycin can be used as a first step treatment in the eradication of Helicobacter pylori for the children in our region; if the treatment fails for some patients, clarithromycin resistance, especially A2143G and A2142G mutations should be considered.
