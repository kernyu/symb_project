BACKGROUND: Combination therapy for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is recommended for patients with antiviral resistance (AVR) or partial response (PR) to earlier antiviral therapy; however, data on outcomes are limited. GOALS: To determine the rate of complete viral suppression (CVS) with combination therapy and to compare CVS among different indications and treatment regimens. METHODS: A cohort of 109 consecutive patients with chronic hepatitis B from 3 liver clinics in Northern California was retrospectively studied. All patients started combination therapy between April 2004 and August 2009 for the following indications: AVR (n = 29), PR (n = 60), or others (n = 20). Combination treatments included lamivudine (LAM), adefovir (ADV), telbivudine (LdT), entecavir (ETV), tenofovir (TDF), and emtricitabine (FTC). CVS was defined as undetectable serum HBV DNA <100 IU/mL. RESULTS: Among the patients, who were nearly all Asian (99%), 73% had >/= 2 prior treatments and 82% had treatment failure (AVR or PR). Median treatment duration of combination therapy was 21 months (range, 6 to 50 mo). The majority (77%) achieved CVS after 6 months of various combination regimens: 80% for ETV+TDF, 76% for TDF+LAM or FTC or LdT, 75% for ETV+ADV, and 69% for ADV+LAM or LdT (P = 0.86). After 6 months of therapy, CVS was observed in a similar proportion of patients treated for PR and AVR (72% and 74%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Although the majority of 109 treatment-experienced patients had prior treatment failure, high rates of CVS were rapidly achieved and did not significantly differ between indications of AVR and PR or between ETV-based and TDF-based regimens.
