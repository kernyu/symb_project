New and effective strategies to transform current antimicrobials are required to address the increasing issue of microbial resistance and declining introduction of new antibiotic drugs. In this context, metal complexes of known drugs and nano delivery systems for antibiotics are proving to be promising strategies. The aim of the study was therefore to synthesize a silver complex of clotrimazole and formulate it into a nano delivery system for enhanced and sustained antibacterial activity against susceptible and resistant Staphylococcus aureus. A silver complex of clotrimazole was synthesized, characterized and further encapsulated into solid lipid nanoparticles to evaluate its antibacterial activity against S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). An in vitro cytotoxicity study was performed on HepG2 cell lines to assess the overall biosafety of the synthesized clotrimazole silver complex to mammalian cells, and was found to be non-toxic to mammalian cells (cell viability >80%). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of clotrimazole and clotrimazole-silver were 31.25 and 9.76 mug/mL against S. aureus, and 31.25 and 15.62 against MRSA, respectively. Clotrimazole SLNs exhibited MIC values of 104 and 208 mug/mL against both MSSA and MRSA at the end of 18 and 36 h, respectively, but thereafter completely lost its antibacterial activity. Clotrimazole-silver SLNs had an MIC value of 52 mug/mL up to 54 h, after which the MIC value was 104 mug/mL against both strains at the end of 72 h. Thus, clotrimazole-silver SLNs was found to be an efficient nanoantibiotic.
