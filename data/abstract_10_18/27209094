A follow-up cohort study was undertaken to document clearance of fecal vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium carriage in 19 infants colonized during a hospital outbreak. By the conclusion of the 14-month study period, all participants had returned terminal negative fecal specimens, supporting the hypothesis that carriage is transient in this population.
