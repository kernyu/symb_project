MurA is an intracellular bacterial enzyme that is essential for peptidoglycan biosynthesis, and is therefore an important target for antibacterial drug discovery. We report the synthesis, in silico studies and extensive structure-activity relationships of a series of quinazolinone-based inhibitors of MurA from Escherichia coli. 3-Benzyloxyphenylquinazolinones showed promising inhibitory potencies against MurA, in the low micromolar range, with an IC50 of 8microM for the most potent derivative (58). Furthermore, furan-substituted quinazolinones (38, 46) showed promising antibacterial activities, with MICs from 1microg/mL to 8microg/mL, concomitant with their MurA inhibitory potencies. These data represent an important step towards the development of novel antimicrobial agents to combat increasing bacterial resistance.
