Fluoroquinolone resistance in extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL)-producing isolates results in very few antimicrobial treatment options. In Taiwan's Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance (TSAR) III program, 124 (52.8%) cases of ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-KP) were resistant to ciprofloxacin. The prevalence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) determinants and chromosomal quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDR) of gyrA and parC genes among ESBL-KP isolates was assessed via PCR sequencing. Chromosomal QRDR mutations were present in most of the 123 (96.8%) cases of ciprofloxacin-resistant ESBL-KP isolates. Sixty-six (53.2%) isolates had at least one PMQR gene. qnrB2, qnrB4, and qnrS1 were detected in 26, 19, and 13 isolates, respectively, whereas qnrA, qnrC, and qnrD were not detected. ESBL genes were transferable via conjugation with either aac(6')Ib-cr or qnrB in 63.6% of the isolates carrying PMQR genes. QnrB was associated with either CTX-M-15 or SHV-12, and aac(6')Ib-cr was linked to CTX-M-3 or CTX-M-14 in plasmids. qnrS did not co-transfer with ESBL genes. Clonal spread of PMQR genes harboring ESBL-KP isolates was observed in three hospitals. QnrA, which is common in Asia, was unexpectedly absent in ESBL-KP in Taiwan. Aside from transmission via clonal spread for ciprofloxacin-resistant ESBL-KP, concomitant transference of PMQR genes with either bla(CTX-M) or bla(SHV) via plasmid was common.
