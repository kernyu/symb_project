The acquisition of multidrug resistance in bacteria underlies the failure of antimicrobial therapy, and the emergence of pathogens that are resistant to almost the entire armoury of antibiotics. Among the proteins that can mediate or contribute to the drug-resistance profile in Gram-positive bacteria is a subset of ATP-binding cassette proteins that are comprised of a tandem-repeated nucleotide-binding domain. In this study, we expressed one of these NBD(2) proteins, LmrC, in an antibiotic-sensitive Gram-positive host strain (Lactococcus lactis) and demonstrated the acquisition of resistance to ribosomally active antibiotics. Mutation of key catalytic residues suggested that the resistance profile was the result of a cellular response, rather than being a function of the NBD(2) protein itself. This observation was confirmed by 2D SDS/PAGE, which demonstrated that the expression of the NBD(2) protein induced a stress response in L. lactis. A model combining this stress response induction and the acquisition of antibiotic resistance is proposed.
