An analysis of the components of the antioxidant defence system in exponential and stationary growth phases of filamentous fungus Phycomyces blakesleeanus and the response to the oxidative stress hydrogen peroxide were performed. There is a strong positive correlation between mycelial antioxidant capacity and the contents of gallic acid, d-erythroascorbate (d-EAA) or d-erythroascorbate monoglucoside (d-EAAG). These secondary metabolites are specifically synthesized by this fungus and reach maximal values in the stationary growth phase, suggesting that they can play some role in the antioxidant defence system of this fungus. There is a differential expression of the two more notable antioxidant activities, catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), depending of the growth stage of P. blakesleeanus, CAT being expressed in the exponential and SOD in the stationary phase. Phycomyces blakesleeanus showed a high resistance to the oxidative stress caused by H2O2 (50 and 200 mM) which was higher in exponential phase. This higher resistance can be explained by the presence of CAT, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and the probable contribution of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and high levels of reduced form of glutathione (GSH). The transition to stationary phase was accompanied with a higher physiological oxidative damage illustrated by the higher protein carbonylation. In this growth stage the resistance of the fungus to the oxidative stress caused by H2O2 could be explained by the presence of SOD, GPx, and the probable contribution of GST as well as of secondary metabolites, mainly d-EAA and d-EAAG. These results highlight a specific response to oxidative stress by H2O2 depending on the growth phase of P. blakesleeanus.
