OBJECTIVE: To compare the risk factors and outcomes of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus with vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus bacteraemia among hospitalised cancer patients. METHODS: The retrospective, case-control study was conducted at Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Lahore, Pakistan, and comprised data of cancer patients whose blood culture grew either vancomycin-sensitive or vancomycin-resistant enterococcus from January 2012 to December 2014. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to determine the factors associated with the development of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus bacteraemia and 12-week mortality. Stata 11 was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Of the 138 cases, 111(80%) were selected, of which 46(41.44%) were of vancomycin-resistant and 65(58.55%) were of vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus. Length of hospital stay prior to bacteraemia (adjusted odds ratio 1.18; 95% confidence interval 1.08-1.28) and use of vancomycin 30 days before the onset of bacteraemia (adjusted odds ratio 9.4; 95% confidence interval 1.70-52.19) were significant risk factors for the development of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus bacteraemia. The overall 12-week mortality rate was 29(63%) for patients with vancomycin-resistant bacteraemia and 28(43.1%) for vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus bacteraemia patients. Risk factors for mortality included the presence of shock at the time of the onset of bacteraemia (adjusted odds ratio 32.91; 95% confidence interval 3.02-358.81). CONCLUSIONS: The length of hospital stay and prior exposure to vancomycin were significant risk factors for the occurrence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus bacteraemia.
