Malaria has emerged as a major health problem worldwide after the appearance of resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum to the most of antimalarial drugs. The development of resistance by the parasite against first line as well as second line antimalarial drugs has drawn attention to develop new drugs to alleviate the disease burden. Therefore, there is a great need for new antimalarial drugs with improved attributes over older therapies. This review is primarily addressed to description of the recent advances in the synthesis of heterocyclic compound as antimalarial agents which can facilitate the development of more potent and effective antimalarial agents.
