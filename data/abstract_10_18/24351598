OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively analyze the bacteriological spectrum and drug susceptibility of pus flora from abdominal traumatic patients with severe intra-abdominal infection. METHODS: A total of 41 severe intra-abdominal infected patients with abdominal trauma were recruited to collect 123 abdominal pus specimens. And the results of laboratory microbiology and drug sensitivity were analyzed with the WHONET 5.4 software. RESULTS: A total of 297 strains of bacteria were isolated at (7.2 +/- 2.3) strains for each patient. Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 44.1% (131/297) , Gram-negative bacteria 55.2% (164/297) and fungi 0.7% (2/297). The top five isolates were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Those antibiotics highly sensitive (>90%) to Escherichia coli included cefoperazone (91%), imipenem (98%); highly sensitive to Gram-positive cocci included teicoplanin (100%) and linezolid (100%). Staphylococcus aureus was 100% sensitive to vancomycin. The agents with a high susceptibility to Klebsiella pneumonia included imipenem (100%) and amikacin (79%). Ciprofloxacin (90%) had the highest sensitivity to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: The predominant bacteria of causing severe intra-abdominal infection of traumatic patients is Gram-negative bacteria, but the infection of Gram-positive bacteria, especially the ratio of Staphylococcus aureus infection is also comparatively high. Cefoperazone, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid have higher antibacterial activity.
