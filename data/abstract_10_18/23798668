OBJECTIVES: The cross-resistance profiles of elvitegravir and dolutegravir on raltegravir-resistant variants is still controversial or not available in macrophages and lack extensive evaluations on wide panels of clonal variants. Thus, a complete evaluation in parallel with all currently available integrase inhibitors (INIs) was performed. METHODS: The integrase coding region was RT-PCR-amplified from patient-derived plasma samples and cloned into an HIV-1 molecular clone lacking the integrase region. Twenty recombinant viruses bearing mutations to all primary pathways of resistance to raltegravir were phenotypically evaluated with each integrase inhibitor in freshly purified CD4+ T cells or monocyte-derived macrophages. RESULTS: Y143R single mutants conferred a higher level of raltegravir resistance in macrophages [fold change (FC) 47.7-60.24] compared with CD4+ T cells (FC 9.55-11.56). All other combinations had similar effects on viral susceptibility to raltegravir in both cell types. Elvitegravir displayed a similar behaviour both in lymphocytes and macrophages with all the tested patterns. When compared with raltegravir, none to modest increases in resistance were observed for the Y143R/C pathways. Dolutegravir maintained its activity and cross-resistance profile in macrophages. Only Q148H/R variants had a reduced level of susceptibility (FC 5.48-18.64). No variations were observed for the Y143R/C (+/-T97A) or N155H variants. CONCLUSIONS: All INIs showed comparable antiretroviral activity in both cell types even if single mutations were associated with a different level of susceptibility in vitro to raltegravir and elvitegravir in macrophages. In particular, dolutegravir was capable of inhibiting with similar potency infection of raltegravir-resistant variants with Y143 or N155 pathways in both HIV-1 major cell reservoirs.
