Hepatitis C is a chronic infection associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. In recent years, there has been a shift in treatment paradigm with the discovery and approval of agents that target specific proteins vital for hepatitis C replication. The NS3/4A inhibitors simeprevir and paritaprevir, the NS5A inhibitors ombitasvir, ledipasvir, and daclatasvir, and the NS5B inhibitors sofosbuvir and dasabuvir have been newly FDA approved and incorporated as first-line agents into the latest IDSA-AASLD guidelines for Hepatitis C treatment. Used in combination, these agents produce higher rates of sustained virologic response and less adverse effects than historical options, along with limited rates of resistance. Pertinent clinical data, pharmacology, and pharmacokinetics are reviewed for these new direct acting antiviral agents.
