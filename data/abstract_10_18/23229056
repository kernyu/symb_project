A series of novel 11,4''-disubstituted azithromycin analogs were synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial activity. All the 11,4''-disubstituted analogs exhibited excellent activity (0.03-0.12 mug/ml) against erythromycin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, and significantly improved activity against three phenotypes of erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae compared with erythromycin A, clarithromycin or azithromycin. Among them, compounds 26-28 showed the most potent activity (0.25, 0.03 and 2 mug/ml) against S. pneumoniae expressing the erm gene, the mef gene and the erm and mef genes, respectively. In addition, compound 28 was the most effective (0.03 and 0.12 mug/ml) against erythromycin-susceptible S. pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus as well. It is noteworthy that the most active compounds described above possess the same terminal 3,5-dinitrophenyl groups on their C-4'' bisamide side chains.
