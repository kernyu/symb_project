We summarize antimicrobial drug resistance (AMR) patterns from blood cultures at a tertiary hospital in Uganda. High rates of resistance to first-line antibiotic drugs were observed among Staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative organisms. Microbiology services with susceptibility testing should be strengthened to support standardized reporting of AMR data in sub-Saharan Africa.
