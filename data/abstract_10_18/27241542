AIM: to evaluate the performance of Vitek2 compact machine (Biomerieux Inc. ver 04.02, France) in reference to manual methods for susceptibility test for Candida resistance among HIV/AIDS patients. METHODS: a comparison study to evaluate Vitek2 compact machine (Biomerieux Inc. ver 04.02, France) in reference to manual methods for susceptibility test for Candida resistance among HIV/AIDS patient was done. Categorical agreement between manual disc diffusion and Vitek2 machine was calculated using predefined criteria. Time to susceptibility result for automated and manual methods were measured. RESULTS: there were 137 Candida isolates comprising eight Candida species with C.albicans and C. glabrata as the first (56.2%) and second (15.3%) most common species, respectively. For fluconazole drug, among the C. albicans, 2.6% was found resistant on manual disc diffusion methods and no resistant was determined by Vitek2 machine; whereas 100% C. krusei was identified as resistant on both methods. Resistant patterns for C. glabrata to fluconazole, voriconazole and amphotericin B were 52.4%, 23.8%, 23.8% vs. 9.5%, 9.5%, 4.8% respectively between manual diffusion disc methods and Vitek2 machine. Time to susceptibility result for automated methods compared to Vitex2 machine was shorter for all Candida species. CONCLUSION: there is a good categorical agreement between manual disc diffusion and Vitek2 machine, except for C. glabrata for measuring the antifungal resistant. Time to susceptibility result for automated methods is shorter for all Candida species.
