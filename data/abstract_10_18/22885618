BACKGROUND: Vulvovaginal candidosis is a common infection in young women, and it is associated with high morbidity and high health costs. AIMS: Vulvovaginal candidosis caused by Candida glabrata is a therapeutic challenge due to the acquired resistance of many strains of this species to azole antifungals. METHODS: We present two cases of vaginal candidosis complicated by fluconazole-resistant Candida glabrata, and treated with voriconazole. RESULTS: Both patients improved after administration of voriconazole, 400 mg/12 h the first day and then 200 mg every 12 h for 14 days. Their symptoms disappeared and cultures became negative. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest voriconazole can be used as a therapeutic alternative for this type of candidosis which, although not life threatening, is associated with a high morbidity.
