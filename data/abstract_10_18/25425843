BACKGROUND: Growing antimicrobial resistance and limited therapeutic options to treat carbapenem-resistant bacteremia prompted us to evaluate the clinical outcomes associated with healthcare-associated bacteremia. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteremia performed at a tertiary care facility in Chennai, India between May 2011 and May 2012. RESULTS: In our study, patients had mean 11.76 days of intensive care unit (ICU) care and mean time to onset of bacteremia was 6.4 days after admission. The commonest organism was Klebsiella pneumoniae (44%). Patients with combination treatment had lower mortality (44.8%) compared with colistin monotherapy (66.6%); (P = 0.35). CONCLUSION: Carbapenem resistant bacteremia is a late onset infection in patients with antibiotic exposure in the ICU and carries a 30 days mortality of 60%; K. pneumoniae is the most common organism at our center. Two drug combinations appear to carry a lower mortality compared with monotherapy.
