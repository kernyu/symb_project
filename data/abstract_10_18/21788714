In Japan, the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was introduced in 2010. To assess the effects of PCV7 on invasive pneumococcal infection in children, a population-based prospective survey has been conducted in 10 prefectures. As a part of the study, blood and nasopharyngeal isolates from children admitted to the Shibata Hospital, Niigata Prefecture, were analyzed for determining the serotypes, their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents, and multilocus sequence types. Sixteen blood isolates were obtained from October 2007 to December 2009. Sixty-three nasopharyngeal isolates were obtained from the posterior nares of 118 children with pneumonia from April to September 2008. The coverage rates of the blood and nasopharyngeal isolates for PCV7 were 81.3% and 57.1%, respectively. Although none of these children had received PCV7, serotype 19A isolates were recovered from 12.5% (2/16) of the blood samples and 12.7% (8/63) of the nasopharyngeal samples. The sequence type of a nasopharyngeal isolate of serotype 19A was ST320, and the minimum inhibitory concentration of penicillin G was 4 mug/mL. In addition to the continuous prospective survey of pneumococcal infection, early introduction of the 13-valent conjugate vaccine, in which the 19A conjugate is included, will be necessary in Japan.
