In ICESp2905, a widespread erm(TR)- and tet(O)-carrying genetic element of Streptococcus pyogenes, the two resistance determinants are contained in separate fragments inserted into a scaffold of clostridial origin. ICESp2905 ( approximately 65.6 kb) was transferable not only in its regular form but also in a defective form lacking the erm(TR) fragment (ICESp2906, approximately 53.0 kb). The erm(TR) fragment was also an independent integrative and conjugative element (ICE) (ICESp2907, approximately 12.6 kb). ICESp2905 thus results from one ICE (ICESp2907) being integrated into another (ICESp2906).
