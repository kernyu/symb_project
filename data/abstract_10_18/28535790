BACKGROUND: Klebsiella pneumoniae is a frequent nosocomial pathogen causing difficult-to-treat infections worldwide. The prevalence of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-KP) is increasing in China. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular epidemiology of KPC-KP in a nosocomial outbreak. METHODS: Fifty-four KPC-KP isolates were consecutively collected between November 2013 and August 2014 during a KPC-KP outbreak in a tertiary care hospital in Beijing, China. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by agar dilution. Carbapenemase, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, 16S rRNA methylase, AmpC beta-lactamase, and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants were detected by PCR amplification. The genetic relatedness of isolates was analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multi-locus sequence typing. RESULTS: All isolates belonged to ST11 except one isolate which was identified as a new sequence type (ST2040). PFGE profile of genomic DNA revealed seven clusters, of which cluster A and C dominated the KPC-KP outbreak and cluster A was replaced by cluster C during the outbreak. PFGE of genomic DNA, S1-PFGE of plasmids, replicon typing, and drug resistant characteristics showed that clonal spread occurred during the outbreak. When compared with isolates within cluster A, all isolates in cluster C harbored rmtB and showed higher level of resistance to cefepime, amikacin, tobramycin, and tigecycline. CONCLUSION: We reported a nosocomial outbreak of KPC-KP with clonal replacement and a new sequence type (ST2040) of KP. High degree of awareness and surveillance of KPC-KP should be given to avoid potential outbreaks, especially in ICU wards.
