The continuing increase in multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) worldwide has created new challenges in treating complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs). A number of novel antimicrobial agents have been developed against resistant pathogens. To target extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing pathogens, novel beta-lactam antibiotics, such as ceftolozane/tazobactam, ceftazidime/avibactam, aztreonam/avibactam, imipenem/relebactam and S-649266, are antimicrobial alternatives for cIAIs. Two new drugs, eravacycline and plazomicin, have activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and ESBL-producers. New lipoglycopeptides and oxazolidinones provide feasible options against resistant Gram-positive pathogens. These novel antimicrobials may play a role in improving the clinical outcomes of cIAIs caused by MDROs.
