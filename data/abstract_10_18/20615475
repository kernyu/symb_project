Infection because of herpes simplex virus (HSV) that is resistant to acyclovir (ACV) poses treatment challenges in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) patients. We present a series of patients with ACV-resistant HSV following HCT who were successfully treated with continuous infusion high-dose ACV after failing standard treatment regimens for ACV-resistant HSV.
