In the present study, it was aimed to investigate the effects of safranal, one of the components of saffron plant, on the inflammation in the rats in which experimental type 2 diabetes and obesity were formed. Type 2 diabetes is a disease characterized by insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction. Therefore, in the present study, high-fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin were used for being able to create experimental type 2 diabetes. In the first 6 weeks of the study, experimental groups were formed in five groups, after the stage of creating insulin resistance. The study groups were designed as control, HFD, HFD-Saf, DYB, and DYB-Saf groups. Safranal treatment was applied to the treatment groups for a period of 4 weeks. Throughout the study period (10 weeks), the weight gains and plasma glucose levels of the rats were determined each week and bi-weekly, respectively. At the end of the study, interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), TAS and TOS levels in the pancreas and plasma were measured. In addition, the insulin and leptin levels in the plasma were determined. It was ascertained that, compared to the diabetic group, safranal decreased the inflammation both in the plasma and pancreas tissue, by reducing the TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels in particular. In addition, safranal was also found to decrease the oxidative stress increased due to type 2 diabetes in the plasma and pancreas tissue. It was concluded that safranal might be helpful in terms of reduction of diabetic complications, by means of its effects on both oxidative stress and inflammation, and that further studies should be carried out for this purpose.
