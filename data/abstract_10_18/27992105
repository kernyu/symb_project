beta-Lactam antibiotics have been used for many years to treat bacterial infections. However the effective treatment of an increasing range of microbial infections is threatened by bacterial resistance to beta-lactams: the prolonged, widespread (and at times reckless) use of these drugs has spawned widespread resistance, which renders them ineffective against many bacterial strains. The cyclobutanone ring system is isosteric with beta-lactam: in cyclobutanone analogues, the eponymous cyclic amide is replaced with an all-carbon ring, the amide N is substituted by a tertiary C-H alpha to a ketone. Cyclobutanone analogues of various beta-lactam antibiotics have been investigated over the last 35 years, initially as prospective antibiotics in their own right and inhibitors of the beta-lactamase enzymes that impart resistance to beta-lactams. More recently they have been tested as inhibitors of other serine proteases and as mechanistic probes of beta-lactam biosynthesis. Cyclobutanone analogues of the penam ring system are the first reversible inhibitors with moderate activity against all classes of beta-lactamase; other compounds from this family inhibit Streptomyces R61 dd-carboxypeptidase/transpeptidase, human neutrophil elastase and porcine pancreatic elastase. But has their potential as enzyme inhibitors been fully exploited? Challenges in synthesising diversely functionalised cyclobutanone derivatives mean that only a limited number have been made (with limited structural diversity) and evaluated. This review surveys the different synthetic approaches that have been taken to these compounds, the investigations made to evaluate their biological activity and prospects for future developments in this area.
