Based on the global burden of tuberculosis and resistant strains that have recently emerged, not responding to existing therapies, it has become urgent to search for new remedies against this global human plague that has been compounded by HIV co-infection. Thus, the search for new drugs against the disease-causing agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), is an ongoing effort. This review discusses the state-of-the-art in anti-tuberculosis pathogenesis and anti-TB drug research, identifying some of the challenges being faced by researchers in the field and sheds light on possible ways forward, particularly in low-income countries.
