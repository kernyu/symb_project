Over the past 10 years, the resistances among microbes are increasing gradually in Europe and greater resistances are seen in southern countries. We studied the prevalence of community-onset ESBL-producing Escherichia coli urinary tract infections in children.As secondary objectives, we analyzed associated risk factors and the resistance patterns in ESBL-producing E coli isolates.Retrospective observational study in a tertiary care hospital about children </=14 years old with community-onset E coli urinary tract infection. The variables studied were age, sex, ESBL-producing, antibiotic therapy 7 to 30 days before the infection, hospitalization 7 to 30 days before the infection, nefrourologic pathology, and vesicoureteral reflux.Between January 1st, 2015 and December 31st, 2016, 229 isolates of E coli were obtained, of whom 21 (9.2%) where ESBL-producing E coli. Median age in non-ESBL-producing was 18 months versus 7 months in ESBL-producing group. Fourteen (66%) of the ESBL-producing group were men (P = .001), 5 (23.8%) were hospitalized 30 days before the infection (P = .001), 12 (57.1%) had nefrourological pathology (P = .003), 6 (28.5%) had vesicoureteral reflux (P = .032). Previous antibiotic therapy was not statistically significant. Multiple regression analyses between sex and 30 days previous hospitalization were r = 3.51 (P = .0001). Multidrug resistant isolates among ESBL-producing E coli was 12 (57%).The retrospective study allowed assessing the problem of ESBL-producing isolates in the outpatient settings. Some risk factors from past studies were confirmed and a combined risk is suggested. The resistant spectrum should be taken into account when choosing antibiotic regimens.
