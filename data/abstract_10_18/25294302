In this work, the molecular and phenotypic antimicrobial resistance and clonal diversity of 10 linezolid-resistant Staphylococcus spp. isolates were investigated. The 7 Staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates presented Staphylococcal cassete chromosome mec (SCCmec) V and belonged to the same pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pulsotype. Their MICs for oxacillin, vancomycin, and linezolid were >/= 256 mug/mL, 1-4 mug/mL, and 8-16 mug/mL, respectively. The 3 S. hominis presented MIC values 32 to >256 mug/mL, 2-4 mug/mL, and 12-24 mug/mL, and all carried the nontypeable SCCmec (ccr1 + mecA class) and belonged to 2 different genotypes. The cfr gene was not found, but the mutation G2603T was detected in S. haemolyticus and C2190T and G2603T in Staphylococcus hominis in 23S rRNA. This study demonstrates the spread of a linezolid-resistant S. haemolyticus genotype and, for the first time, describes the mutation C2190T among S. hominis isolates with a double mutation in Brazil.
