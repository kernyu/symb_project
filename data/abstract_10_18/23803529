Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) modeling and simulation has evolved as an important tool for rational drug development and drug use, where developed models characterize both the typical trends in the data and quantify the variability in relationships between dose, concentration, and desired effects and side effects. In parallel, rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria imposes new challenges on modern health care. Models that can characterize bacterial growth, bacterial killing by antibiotics and immune system, and selection of resistance can provide valuable information on the interactions between antibiotics, bacteria, and host. Simulations from developed models allow for outcome predictions of untested scenarios, improved study designs, and optimized dosing regimens. Today, much quantitative information on antibiotic PKPD is thrown away by summarizing data into variables with limited possibilities for extrapolation to different dosing regimens and study populations. In vitro studies allow for flexible study designs and valuable information on time courses of antibiotic drug action. Such experiments have formed the basis for development of a variety of PKPD models that primarily differ in how antibiotic drug exposure induces amplification of resistant bacteria. The models have shown promise for efficacy predictions in patients, but few PKPD models describe time courses of antibiotic drug effects in animals and patients. We promote more extensive use of modeling and simulation to speed up development of new antibiotics and promising antibiotic drug combinations. This review summarizes the value of PKPD modeling and provides an overview of the characteristics of available PKPD models of antibiotics based on in vitro, animal, and patient data.
