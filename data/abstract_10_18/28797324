A novel variant of the plasmid-borne colistin resistance gene mcr-3 was detected on an IncHI2 plasmid in an ST131 CTX-M-55-producing Escherichia coli isolate from a Danish patient with bloodstream infection in 2014. The discovery of novel plasmid-borne genes conferring resistance to colistin is of special interest since colistin has reemerged as an important drug in the treatment of infections with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.
