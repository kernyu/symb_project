This study investigated the in vitro efficacy of mequindox against enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), and characterized the oqxAB genes as the main mequindox resistance determinant in E. coli strains of animal origin. A total of 1123 E. coli isolates were collected from domestic animals in China from the 1970s to 2013, and mequindox susceptibility was tested by broth microdilution. The percentage of E. coli isolates with increased mequindox MICs of >/= 64 mug/ml showed a rising trend each year throughout the study period. Mequindox showed good bactericidal activity in vitro towards 20 EPEC strains, although it had a wide mutant selection window. All 1123 E. coli isolates were tested for the presence of the oqxAB genes, and the operon was detected in 322 isolates, which accounted for 94.4% (322/341) of isolates with increased MICs to mequindox (MIC >/= 64 mug/ml). Of the isolates with mequindox MIC </= 32 mug/ml, 98.8% (773/782) were oqxAB negative. Polymerase chain reaction-based stability testing revealed that the IS26-oqxAB circular intermediate was present in 93.4% (309/331) of the oqxAB-positive strains, indicating that this IS26-flanked Tn6010 element was unstable and prone to excision via IS26-mediated recombination. Functional analysis of the oqxAB genes confirmed that this operon alone is sufficient to confer resistance or increased MICs to multiple antimicrobials, including mequindox. This is the first study to investigate the relationship between mequindox susceptibility and oqxAB genotype, and may provide the basis for establishing the resistance breakpoint for mequindox against E. coli.
