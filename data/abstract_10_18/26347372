UNLABELLED: The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence and characterization of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae from spring waters in Mountain Tai of China. ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae were found in four out of 50 sampled spring waters (4/50, 8.0%) and a total of 16 non-duplicate ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae were obtained, including 13 Escherichia coli (E. coli) and three Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kl. pneumoniae). All 16 nonduplicate ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates harboured genes encoding CTX-M ESBLs, among which six expressed CTX-M-15, five produced CTX-M-14, three produced CTX-M-55 and two expressed CTX-M-27. Four multilocus sequence types (ST) were found and ST131 was the dominant type (8/16, 50.0%). Taken together, the contamination of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae were present in spring waters of Mountain Tai. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results indicated that spring waters could become a reservoir of antibiotic resistant bacteria and contribute to the spread of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria via drinking water or food chain. In addition, wastewater discharge of restaurants or hotels may be an important contribution source of antibiotic resistant bacteria in spring waters.
