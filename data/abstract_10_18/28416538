We tested 59 common and 27 uncommon Aspergillus species isolates for susceptibility to the mold-active azole antifungal agents itraconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole using the Sensititre method. The overall essential agreement with the CLSI reference method was 96.5% for itraconazole and posaconazole and was 100% for voriconazole. By the Sensititre method as well as the CLSI reference method, all of 10 A. fumigatus isolates with a cyp51 mutant genotype were classified as being non-wild-type isolates (MIC > epidemiological cutoff value [ECV]) with respect to triazole susceptibility.
