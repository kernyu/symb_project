Systemic fungal infection related to fluconazole-resistant yeasts are emerging in immunocompromised patients. In this case-series, we report eight cases of fungemia caused by Trichosporon spp. (2), Stephanoascus ceferrii (1), Kodamaea ohmeri (1), Pichia kutrawersi (2), Candida rugosa (1) and Candida lusitianae (1) in immunocompromised patients. All the yeasts except (Trichosporon asahii) were sequenced. As these rare species are inherently resistant to antifungal agents and they may lead to the development of nosocomial outbreaks, therefore, accurate identification followed by antifungal susceptibility testing is crucial for proper treatment and management.
