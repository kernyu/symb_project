A collection of 29 pathogenesis-related 10 (PR10) genes of Medicago sativa and Medicago truncatula showed that they were almost all obtained from cDNA libraries of tissues undergoing abiotic or biotic stresses. The predicted proteins could be divided into two subclasses, PR10.1 and PR10.2, but in silico predicted models of their three-dimensional structures revealed that they could be further divided based on size of the hydrophobic internal cavity and number of beta-bulges. A comparison of the expression of two highly similar M. sativa subclass PR10.1 genes, MsPR10.1A and MsPR10.1B, predicted to have similar sized hydrophobic internal cavities, but a different number of beta-bulges revealed differences in their expression patterns. MsPR10.1A was induced faster than MsPR10.1B by ABA, ethylene, and X. campestris pv. alfalfae, but slower than MsPR10.1B by harvesting and wounding. Unlike MsPR10.1A, MsPR10.1B expression was induced in non-harvested tissues following harvesting, but was not induced by heat treatment. Histochemical observations of Nicotiana benthamiana transformed with 657 bp of the MsPR10.1A promoter fused to the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene showed that GUS expression was wound-inducible in leaves, which was consistent with MsPR10.1A expression in alfalfa leaves. GUS expression in stems and leaves was mostly in vascular tissue. The MsPR10.1A promoter may be valuable in controlling the expression in vascular tissues and disease resistance.
