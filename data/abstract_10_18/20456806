A 70-year-old woman was admitted to hospital with fever and signs of bronchopneumonia following a recent visit to Southeast Asia. She was diagnosed with melioidosis and treated with ceftazidime i.v. for two weeks, followed by oral co-trimoxazol and folinic acid. She recovered and had no recurring disease in the first year following recovery. Melioidosis is caused by an infection with Burkholderia pseudomallei. Clinical presentation can vary, but pneumonia is present in most patients. The diagnosis should be considered in patients with reduced immunological resistance who have been in endemic areas such as Southeast Asia, especially during the rainy season. It is important to determine which countries have been visited by patients who have recently returned from tropical areas. In addition, the time of onset, the duration of symptoms and a detailed physical examination are essential in the assessment of patients presenting with exotic diseases.
