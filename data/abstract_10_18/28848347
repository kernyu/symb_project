Development of effective antibacterial agents for the treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria resistant to existing antibiotics, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), is an area of intensive research. In this work, the antibacterial efficacy of two antimicrobial peptides derived from plectasin, AP114 and AP138, used alone and in combination with monolaurin-lipid nanocapsules (ML-LNCs) was evaluated. Several interesting findings emerged from the present study. First, ML-LNCs and both plectasin derivatives showed potent activity against all 14 tested strains of S. aureus, independent of their resistance phenotype. Both peptides displayed a considerable adsorption (33%-62%) onto ML-LNCs without having an important impact on the particle properties such as size. The combinations of peptide with ML-LNC displayed synergistic effect against S. aureus, as confirmed by two methods: checkerboard and time-kill assays. This synergistic interaction enables a dose reduction and consequently decreases the risk of toxicity and has the potential of minimizing the development of resistance. Together, these results suggest that ML-LNCs loaded with a plectasin derivative may be a very promising drug delivery system for further development as a novel antibacterial agent against S. aureus, including MRSA.
