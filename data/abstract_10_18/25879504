Seven new sesquiterpenoids together with 21 known sesquiterpenoid derivatives were isolated from the medicinal plant Ferula ferulioides (Steud.) Korovin. Their structures were elucidated by comprehensive spectroscopic analyses and chemical transformations. The isolated compounds were evaluated for their antibacterial activities against a panel of bacteria including multidrug-resistant (MDR) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), displaying minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values in the range of 0.5-128 mg/l.
