BACKGROUND: The Emergence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in Enterobacteriace species imparting resistance to thirdgeneration cephalosporins is a growing concern worldwide. aims: This study was undertaken to characterize ESBL producers from clinical isolates of Providencia stuartii in Tunisia. methods: We analysed ten non-duplicate ESBL positive, P. stuartii isolates collected in intensive care units of military Hospital in Tunisia from blood specimens and presented an extended-spectrum resistance phenotype . the presence of the blaPER-1 encoding genes was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. results:We detected PER-1 in three of ten isolates of P. stuartii. The gene coding for this enzyme was located on a 100 kb conjugative plasmid that encoded a beta-lactamase with a pI of 5.3. CONCLUSION: This study suggests the spreading of this gene among P. stuartii. clinical strains in the next year in Tunisia.
