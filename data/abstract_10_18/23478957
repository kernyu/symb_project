Klebsiella pneumoniae strain MRSN2404 was isolated from the chronic wound of a soldier who had been wounded in Iraq in 2006. The strain displayed very high MICs of all aminoglycosides, including arbekacin. A gene encoding a novel 16S rRNA methyltransferase, now designated RmtH, was identified. RmtH had 64% identity with RmtB1 and RmtB2. rmtH was bracketed by two copies of ISCR2, which may have played a role in its mobilization.
