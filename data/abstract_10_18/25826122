Previous studies reported a relatively low prevalence of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) in South Korea (<5%). A genotypic resistance test was performed on 131 treatment-naive HIV-1-infected individuals from February 2013 to February 2014. Eleven individuals (8.4%) presented TDR, of whom eight had K103N, revealing a significant increase in K103N TDR compared to previous studies (p<0.001). Using phylogenetic analysis, we identified three distinct clustering pairs with genetic relativeness and a total of five independent strains among the eight K103N cases. Our findings suggest that multiple sources of K103N occurred, most likely as a consequence of increased efavirenz use in South Korea.
