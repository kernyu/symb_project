INTRODUCTION: Staphylococcus aureus is known as a common pathogen in atopic dermatitis. A methicillin-resistant S. aureus strain with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin (VISA/VRSA) is increasing worldwide. The aims of this study were to evaluate the antibiotic-susceptibility pattern of S. aureus isolated from children with atopic dermatitis and to identify the occurrence of resistance to glycopeptide antibiotics. METHODS: Swabs were collected from atopic dermatitis skin lesions of 80 children being treated at dermatology clinics whose ages ranged from 6 months to 15 years in the period from March 2009 to February 2010. Isolates were studied with an antibiogram for an antibiotic-susceptibility test. The selected antibiotics were the usually administered antimicrobials at dermatological clinics in Buraydah (Qassim, Saudi Arabia). Results were determined as minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) using the Vitek system. RESULTS: Thirty S. aureus isolates showed resistance to streptomycin (100%), benzylpenicillin and ampicillin (96.7%), and oxacillin (90%). S. aureus resistance to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, tigecycline, and vancomycin was 63.3%, 83.3%, and 53.3%, respectively. Resistance to linezolid was less, at 5.7%. CONCLUSIONS: Strains of MRSA with decreasing susceptibility to vancomycin were documented in the Qassim region of Saudi Arabia. Other studies will be required on VISA/VRSA strains concerning phenotypic and genotypic characterization.
