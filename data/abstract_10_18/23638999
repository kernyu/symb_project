Preparations with elicitation activity were obtained from the mycelium of Leptosphaeria maculans , a fungal pathogen of oilseed rape (Brassica napus). Crude delipidated and deproteinized extract from fungal cell walls induced expression of pathogenesis related gene 1 (PR1), hydrogen peroxide accumulation, and enhanced resistance of B. napus plants toward infection by L. maculans. Elicitation activity significantly decreased after treatment of a crude extract with alpha- or beta-glucanase. Monosaccharide composition analysis of a crude extract purified by ion-exchange chromatography revealed glucose ( approximately 58 mol %), mannose ( approximately 22 mol %), and galactose ( approximately 18 mol %) as the major sugars. FT-IR and NMR spectra confirmed the presence of both carbohydrate and polypeptide components in the purified product. Correlation NMR experiments defined trisaccharide bound to O-3 of serine residue alpha-D-Glcp-(1-->2)-beta-D-Galf-(1-->6)-alpha-D-Manp-(1-->3)-L-Ser. Terminal alpha-D-Glcp and (1-->6)-beta-D-glucan were also detected. The obtained results strongly support the conclusion that these carbohydrates induce defense response in B. napus plants.
