The aim of the study was to describe the antimicrobial resistance rate of Helicobacter pylori isolated from previously untreated patients in Norway, including the application of two different methods for the determination of metronidazole susceptibility. Altogether 102 isolates obtained in 2008 and 2009 from previously untreated patients suspected of H. pylori related disease, were examined applying a standardized European study protocol. The activity of amoxicillin, tetracycline, clarithromycin, metronidazole, rifabutin and levofloxacin was recorded after an incubation period of 72-96 h in a microaerobic atmosphere. Strains resistant to metronidazole were re-examined for metronidazole resistance applying anaerobic conditions for the first 24 h. None of the isolates were resistant to amoxicillin or tetracycline, whereas 5, 9% were resistant to clarithromycin and 22, 5% resistant to metronidazole tested conventionally. Applying local standards the metronidazole resistance rate fell to 7, 8%, highlighting the importance of the methodology applied for metronidazole susceptibility testing.
