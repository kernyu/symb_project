The premise of inhibiting autophagy to overcome resistance to chemotherapy has been investigated in 5 clinical phase I trials combining hydroxychloroquine with vorinostat, temsirolimus, temozolomide, or bortezomib. These studies have provided a number of insights relating to the tolerability of the combination treatments. In addition, these studies should provide guidance in the planning and design of future trials to directly determine whether the strategy of autophagy inhibition could prove useful in the treatment of various malignancies.
