PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence, genotype, risk factors and mortality in patients having vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VR E. faecalis) and Enterococcus faecium (VR E. faecium) infection or colonisation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 1488 clinical isolates of E. faecalis and E. faecium were tested for vancomycin resistance by phenotypic (disk diffusion, E-test and broth micro-dilution test) and genotypic polymerase chain reaction methods. Records of all 1488 patients who had E. faecalis or E. faecium infection or colonisation were reviewed for the identification of host, hospital and medication related risk factors associated with VR E. faecalis and VR E. faecium. RESULTS: Of 1488 isolates, 118 (7.9%) were vancomycin-resistant and their distributions were as follows: E. faecalis=72 (61%) and E. faecium=46 (39%). All 118 vancomycin-resistant isolates were vanA genotype (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] to vancomycin >/=64 mug/ml and MIC to teicoplanin>/=32 mug/ml) and none of the isolates was vanB genotype. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified ventilator support and hospital stay for >/=48 h as independent risk factors associated with VR E. faecalis and VR E. faecium infection or colonisation. Hospital stay>/=48 h was the only independent risk factor for mortality in patients infected with vancomycin-resistant enterococci. CONCLUSIONS: Strategies to limit the nosocomial infection especially in patients on ventilator support can reduce VRE incidence and related mortality.
