BACKGROUND: Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major obstacle to the treatment of gastric cancer (GC). Using a phage display approach, we previously obtained the peptide GMBP1, which specifically binds to the surface of MDR gastric cancer cells and is subsequently internalized. Furthermore, GMBP1 was shown to have the potential to reverse the MDR phenotype of gastric cancer cells, and GRP78 was identified as the receptor for this peptide. The present study aimed to investigate the mechanism of peptide GMBP1 and its receptor GRP78 in modulating gastric cancer MDR. METHODS: Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and immunofluorescence staining were used to investigate the subcellular location and mechanism of GMBP1 internalization. iTRAQ was used to identify the MDR-associated downstream targets of GMBP1. Differentially expressed proteins were identified in GMBP1-treated compared to untreated SGC7901/ADR and SGC7901/VCR cells. GO and KEGG pathway analyses of the differentially expressed proteins revealed the interconnection of these proteins, the majority of which are involved in MDR. Two differentially expressed proteins were selected and validated by western blotting. RESULTS: GMBP1 and its receptor GRP78 were found to be localized in the cytoplasm of GC cells, and GRP78 can mediate the internalization of GMBP1 into MDR cells through the transferrin-related pathway. In total, 3,752 and 3,749 proteins were affected in GMBP1-treated SGC7901/ADR and SGC7901/VCR cells, respectively, involving 38 and 79 KEGG pathways. Two differentially expressed proteins, CTBP2 and EIF4E, were selected and validated by western blotting. CONCLUSION: This study explored the role and downstream mechanism of GMBP1 in GC MDR, providing insight into the role of endoplasmic reticulum stress protein GRP78 in the MDR of cancer cells.
