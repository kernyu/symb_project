The steady increase in antimicrobial resistance is of growing concern in healthcare. Antibiotic Stewardship [ABS] Strategies are important tools to control antibiotic use and -prevent antimicrobial resistance. An increasing number of institutions are developing ABS initiatives also in pediatrics. However, few data are available assessing the implementation and efficiency of these pediatric ABS programs.At the Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilian University, a tertiary care pediatric reference center, a pediatric ABS Team has been implemented. Key structural elements were the same as for adult patients, but antimicrobials agents selected for monitoring and appropriate clinical endpoints are different in pediatrics.Key features were: 1. prospective-audit with feedback and formulary restriction and 2. pre-authorization (also referred to as prior approval). The ABS team consisted of one pediatric infectious disease specialist, one clinical fellow in pediatric infectious diseases, and one clinical pharmacist with training in infectious diseases.With the implementation of a pediatric ABS strategy we could significantly influence antimicrobial consumption in our hospital. Cost-savings are estimated to be above 330 000 euro per year, and concomitantly the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal compounds was significantly reduced.Antibiotic Stewardship [ABS] Strategies may be an effective tool to control antibiotic use in the setting of a large tertiary pediatric teaching hospital. A national guideline for ABS initiatives may help to further improve rational use of antibiotics in the hospital setting.
