Interplay between drug-resistance mutations in CTL epitopes and HIV-1-specific CTLs may influence the control of HIV-1 viremia. However, the effect of integrase inhibitor (INI)-resistance mutations on the CTL recognition has not been reported. We here investigated the effect of a raltegravir and elvitegravir-resistance mutation (E92Q) on HLA-B*40:02-restricted Int92-102 (EL11: ETGQETAYFLL)-specific CTLs. EL11-specific CTLs recognized E92Q peptide-pulsed and E92Q mutant virus-infected cells less effectively than EL11 peptide-pulsed and wild-type virus-infected cells, respectively. Ex vivo ELISpot analysis showed no induction of E92Q-specific T cells in chronically HIV-1-infected individuals. Thus, we demonstrated that EL11-specific CTL recognition was affected by the INI-resistance mutation.
