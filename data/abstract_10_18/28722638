Mass administration of azithromycin (MDA) is integral to trachoma control. Recent studies suggest that MDA may increase drug-resistant pathogens, yet findings from prior studies suggest little long-term impact on resistance. This disparity may be linked to differences in pre-MDA community-level resistance patterns. We describe carriage prevalence and antibiotic resistance patterns for Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) (nasopharyngeal swab collection), Staphylococcus aureus (SA) (nasopharyngeal swabs), and Escherichia coli (EC) (rectal swabs) in 1,047 children ages 1-59 months in a district with MDA cessation 4 years ago. Antibiotic susceptibility was evaluated by disk diffusion and Etest. The carriage rates for Spn, SA, and EC were 43.5% (455/1,047), 13.2% (138/1,047), and 61.7% (646/1,047), respectively. Resistance to AZM was observed in 14.3%, 29.0%, and 16.6% of the Spn, SA, and EC isolates, respectively. Spn resistance was variable (0-67%) by hamlet. Future analyses will assess the influence of pre-MDA antibiotic resistance patterns on those observed following MDA.
