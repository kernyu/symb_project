The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiology of pyrazinamide (PZA) resistance and the associated risk factors as well as to evaluate the pncA gene loci as a marker for PZA resistance in China. A population-based multicenter study of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) cases was carried out from 2011 to 2013 in four Chinese districts/counties with different geographic and socioeconomic features. Testing for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and susceptibility to PZA was done by the proportion method on Lowenstein-Jensen medium and Bactec MGIT 960, respectively. Mutations in the pncA gene were identified by sequencing. Among 878 culture-positive cases, 147 (16.7%) were resistant to PZA, with a significantly higher proportion among MDR isolates than among the first-line drug-susceptible isolates (30.2% versus 7.7%; P < 0.001). In total, 136 isolates had a nonsynonymous pncA mutation, with a comparable diagnostic performance between Beijing family and non-Beijing family as well as between MDR-TB and first-line drug-susceptible TB. Furthermore, the mutations in isolates with high-level PZA resistance (MIC > 500 mg/liter) were observed mainly in three regions of the pncA gene (codons 51 to 76, codons 130 to 142, and codons 163 to 180). Patients with prior treatment history had a significantly higher risk for PZA monoresistance (odds ratio [OR], 2.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.363 to 6.015) and MDR PZA resistance (OR, 6.47; 95% CI, 3.186 to 13.15), while the additional factors associated with MDR PZA resistance were the patient's age (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.003 to 1.042), lung cavity (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.296 to 5.391). These findings suggest that it is a priority to identify PZA resistance in MDR-TB and that a rapid molecular diagnostic test based on pncA mutations in the Chinese settings where MDR-TB prevalence is high should be developed.
