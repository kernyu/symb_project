Large tertiary care hospitals (TCHs) are thought to have higher antimicrobial resistance (AMR) rates when compared to small community hospitals (SCHs) as they provide care to patients with higher disease severity. However, we found no systematic differences in AMR rates between TCHs and SCHs in the United States.
