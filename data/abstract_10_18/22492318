BACKGROUND: Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates harboring the K. pneumoniae carbapenemase gene (bla(KPC)) are creating a significant healthcare threat in both acute and long-term care facilities (LTCFs). As part of a study conducted in 2004 to determine the risk of stool colonization with extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacteria, 12 isolates of K. pneumoniae that exhibited nonsusceptibility to extended-spectrum cephalosporins were detected. All were gastrointestinal carriage isolates that were not associated with infection. METHODS: Reassessment of the carbapenem minimum inhibitory concentrations using revised 2011 Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoints uncovered carbapenem resistance. To further investigate, a DNA microarray assay, PCR-sequencing of bla genes, immunoblotting, repetitive-sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were performed. RESULTS: The DNA microarray detected bla(KPC) in all 12 isolates, and bla(KPC-3) was identified by PCR amplification and sequencing of the amplicon. In addition, a bla(SHV-11) gene was detected in all isolates. Immunoblotting revealed "low-level" production of the K. pneumoniae carbapenemase, and rep-PCR indicated that all bla(KPC-3)-positive K. pneumoniae strains were genetically related (>/=98% similar). According to MLST, all isolates belonged to sequence type 36. This sequence type has not been previously linked with bla(KPC) carriage. Plasmids from 3 representative isolates readily transferred the bla(KPC-3) to Escherichia coli J-53 recipients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal the "silent" dissemination of bla(KPC-3) as part of Tn4401b on a mobile plasmid in Northeast Ohio nearly a decade ago and establish the first report, to our knowledge, of K. pneumoniae containing bla(KPC-3) in an LTCF caring for neurologically impaired children and young adults.
