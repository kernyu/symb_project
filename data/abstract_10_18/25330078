Some emerging but less common human fungal pathogens are known environmental species and could be of low virulence. Meanwhile, some species have natural antifungal drug resistance, which may pose significant clinical diagnosis and treatment challenges. Implant breast augmentation is one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures in China, and fungal infection of breast implants is considered rare. Here we report the isolation of a rare human fungal species, Quambalaria cyanescens, from a female patient in China. The patient had undergone bilateral augmentation mammoplasty 11 years ago and was admitted to Peking Union Medical College Hospital on 15 September 2011 with primary diagnosis of breast infection. She underwent surgery to remove the implant and fully recovered thereafter. During surgery, implants and surrounding tissues were removed and sent for histopathology and microbiology examination. Our careful review showed that there was no solid histopathologic evidence of infection apart from inflammation. However, a fungal strain, which was initially misidentified as "Candida tropicalis" because of the similar appearance on CHROMagar Candida, was recovered. The organism was later on re-identified as Q. cyanescens, based on sequencing of the rDNA internal transcribed spacer region rather than the D1/D2 domain of 26S rDNA. It exhibited high MICs to 5-flucytosine and all echinocandins, but appeared more susceptible to amphotericin B and azoles tested. The possible pathogenic role of Q. cyanescens in breast implants is discussed in this case, and the increased potential for misidentification of the isolate is a cause for concern as it may lead to inappropriate antifungal treatment.
