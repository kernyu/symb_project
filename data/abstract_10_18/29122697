Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii complex (CRABC) is an emerging pathogen that causes bloodstream infections and nosocomial pneumonia. This study aimed to describe severe infection associated with CRABC bacteraemic pneumonia and to investigate risk factors for 28-day mortality. All patients aged >/=18 years with CRABC bacteraemic pneumonia were enrolled retrospectively at five teaching hospitals in South Korea. Empirical antimicrobial therapy was defined as appropriate if administration of at least one antimicrobial agent, to which the causative pathogen was susceptible, for >48 h, within 5 days of the onset of bacteraemia. During the study period, 146 patients with CRABC bacteraemic pneumonia were enrolled. Among them, 128 (87.7%) patients were treated in the intensive care unit; of these, 110 (75.3%) had ventilator-associated pneumonia. A total of 42 patients (28.8%) received appropriate empirical therapy. There was no difference in baseline characteristics between the appropriate and inappropriate empirical treatment groups. However, 28-day mortality was higher in the inappropriate therapy group (54.8% vs. 76.9%; P = 0.008). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score >/=20 [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.58; P = 0.02], septic shock (HR = 3.49, 95% CI 2.15-5.67; P <0.001) and inappropriate empirical therapy (HR = 3.24, 95% CI 1.94-5.42; P <0.001) were independently associated with an adverse outcome. In conclusion, the mortality rate of CRABC bacteraemic pneumonia was extremely high. Appropriate empirical therapy might improve the outcome of patients with CRABC bacteraemic pneumonia.
