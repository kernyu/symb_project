AIM: To study the effect of complex of natural cytokines and antimicrobial peptides (CNCAP) included in preparation Superlymph on growth of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis CN-37 on the modem of murine peritoneal macrophages (MPh) cultivated in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Effect of CNCAP on peritoneal MPh of tuberculosis-susceptible mice C57BL/6 infected by M. tuberculosis CN-37 was studied using ex vivo model. Macrophages were preliminary incubated with CNCAP during one day. M. tuberculosis growth was assessed on 7th day by PCR. RESULTS: Preliminary incubation of infected MPh with CNCAP resulted in inhibition of M. tuberculosis CN-37 growth. CONCLUSION: Superlymph activates macrophages which lead to enhanced bactericidal action of MPh on M. tuberculosis CN-37.
