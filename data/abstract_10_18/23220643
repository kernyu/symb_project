Two novel fluorescent cephalosporins, TCA and TBCA, were synthesized and characterized by (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, UV-vis, and fluorescence spectroscopies. Biological activity assays demonstrated that TCA inactivated a Klebsiella pneumonia strain that expressed extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. Incubation of 6 muM TCA with K. pneumonia cultures resulted in cell death for 84% of the cells after 126 J/cm(2) of light irradiation. In vitro, TCA exhibited a MIC = 0.5 mug/mL with Staphylococcus aureus. Kinetic evaluation revealed that TCA and TBCA were substrates for B1 and B3 subclass metallo-beta-lactamases. TBCA exhibited stronger binding affinities to the Gram-positive bacterial strains MRSA1, MRSA2, and S. aureus with value of 2.95-6.59 muM per 10(8) cells/mL.
