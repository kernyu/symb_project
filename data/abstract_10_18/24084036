The emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR) bacteria has become a medical and veterinary problem. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) show potential to overcome antibiotic resistance and could be used therapeutically. A novel AMP (AMP2041) was developed in silico and its microbiocidal activity against MDR clinical strains isolated from cattle (n=6), dogs (n=8), and pigs (n=20) was evaluated. AMP2041 showed strong antimicrobial activity against all Gram-positive and Gram-negative MDR clinical strains tested. Within 20 min of incubation, there was complete killing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27953 and a 90% reduction of colony count for Escherichia coli ATCC 25922. For Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, a 90% reduction of colony count was observed within 120 min of incubation.
