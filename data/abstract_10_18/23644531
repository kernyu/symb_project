ALT-803, a complex of an interleukin (IL)-15 superagonist mutant and a dimeric IL-15 receptor alphaSu/Fc fusion protein, was found to exhibit significantly stronger in vivo biologic activity on NK and T cells than IL-15. In this study, we show that a single dose of ALT-803, but not IL-15 alone, eliminated well-established 5T33P and MOPC-315P myeloma cells in the bone marrow of tumor-bearing mice. ALT-803 treatment also significantly prolonged survival of myeloma-bearing mice and provided resistance to rechallenge with the same tumor cells through a CD8(+) T-cell-dependent mechanism. ALT-803 treatment stimulated CD8(+) T cells to secrete large amounts of IFN-gamma and promoted rapid expansion of CD8(+)CD44(high) memory T cells in vivo. These memory CD8(+) T cells exhibited ALT-803-mediated upregulation of NKG2D (KLRK1) but not PD-1 (PDCD1) or CD25 (IL2RA) on their cell surfaces. ALT-803-activated CD8(+) memory T cells also exhibited nonspecific cytotoxicity against myeloma and other tumor cells in vitro, whereas IFN-gamma had no direct effect on myeloma cell growth. ALT-803 lost its antimyeloma activity in tumor-bearing IFN-gamma knockout mice but retained the ability to promote CD8(+)CD44(high) memory T-cell proliferation, indicating that ALT-803-mediated stimulation of CD8(+)CD44(high) memory T cells is IFN-gamma-independent. Thus, besides well-known IL-15 biologic functions in host immunity, this study shows that IL-15-based ALT-803 could activate CD8(+)CD44(high) memory T cells to acquire a unique innate-like phenotype and secrete IFN-gamma for nonspecific tumor cell killing. This unique immunomodulatory property of ALT-803 strongly supports its clinical development as a novel immunotherapeutic agent against cancer and viral infections.
