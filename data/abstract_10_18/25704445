Antibiotic resistance patterns of more than 120 000 clinical Escherichia coli isolates were retrospectively analysed. Isolates originated from both hospitalized patients and outpatients from the region of southeast Austria from 1998 to 2013. Except for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, nitrofurantoin and piperacillin/tazobactam, all of the antibiotics analysed showed increasing proportions of resistant isolates over time, which were most prominent for ampicillin (from 25.4% in 1998 to 40% in 2013), cefotaxime (0.1% to 6.7%), ceftazidime (0.3% to 14.2%), ciprofloxacin (4.3% to 16.7%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (14.6% to 24.8%). There was a marked increase in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-positive isolates (0.1% to 6.3%) starting in 2005, with male patients and hospital-related patients showing a higher increase than female patients and outpatients. Proportions of resistant isolates for most antibiotics were generally higher for male patients and hospital-related patients. Amikacin, nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole showed a marked increase in resistance proportions among male subjects aged 10 to 19 years which were absent for female subjects, indicating a strong modulation potential of host characteristics.
