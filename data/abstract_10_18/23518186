We characterized nine carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae collected over 9 months during 2011 in Riyadh; 8 from Hospital A and 1 from Hospital B. Variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) defined three strains at Hospital A, each with 2 or 3 representatives recovered from separate patients over periods of 6-24 weeks; 2 strains had OXA-48 and 1 had NDM. The single isolate from Hospital B also had OXA-48 but was distinct by VNTR from the Hospital A strains. Two strains with OXA-48 were colistin resistant; the third included a colistin-resistant representative from a colistin-treated patient.
