INTRODUCTION: Chryseobacterium indologenes is an uncommon human pathogen. Most infections have been detected in hospitalized patients with severe underlying diseases who had indwelling devices implanted. Infection caused by C. indologenes in a newborn has not been previously reported. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by C. indologenes in a full-term Caucasian newborn baby boy with congenital heart disease who was successfully treated with piperacillin-tazobactam. CONCLUSION: C. indologenes should be considered as a potential pathogen in newborns in the presence of invasive equipment or treatment with long-term broad-spectrum antibiotics. Appropriate choice of effective antimicrobial agents for treatment is difficult because of the unpredictability and breadth of antimicrobial resistance of these organisms, which often involves resistance to many of the antibiotics chosen empirically for serious Gram-negative infections.
