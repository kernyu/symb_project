BACKGROUND: The resistance of Helicobacter pylori to antibiotics has increased the need for new empirical, first-line treatments. However, the efficacy of sequential therapy (ST) and concomitant therapy (CT) compared with triple therapy (TT) has not been adequately evaluated. AIM: In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of these empirical three regimens. METHODS: The 517 patients enrolled in the study were prospectively randomized to receive 10 days of TT (n=171), ST (n=170), and CT (n=176) at 5 university-affiliated hospitals from May 2013 to March 2015. The post-treatment H. pylori status was determined using the (13)C-urea breath test. RESULTS: The baseline characteristics were similar among the three groups. The intention-to-treat eradication rates were 62.6%, 70.6%, and 77.8% in the TT, ST, and CT groups, respectively (p<0.01). The corresponding per-protocol eradication rates were 82.8%, 89.5%, and 94.4%, respectively (p<0.01). There were no significant differences in the compliance, side effects, and follow-up loss rates. CONCLUSION: A higher eradication rate was achieved with empirical 10-day ST, and CT than with the TT regimen, with similar rates of compliance and treatment side effects.
