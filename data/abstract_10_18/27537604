INTRODUCTION: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and liver-related death worldwide. Currently, the anti-HCV armamentarium encompasses several direct-acting antivirals (DAA) that achieve very high response rates and have an excellent tolerability profile. However, they do not represent a final solution for HCV global eradication for at least these two reasons: i) some patients harbour resistant strains to DAAs and cannot benefit from currently available treatments; ii) the cost of these drugs remains very high. AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes pre-clinical and clinical data regarding HCV translation inhibitors, a new class of drugs currently in the pipeline with novel mechanisms of action. EXPERT OPINION: The availability of DAAs resolved most issues related to HCV treatment compared with the previous interferon-based therapies. However, there are some patients that cannot achieve a viral clearance with currently available treatments. Therefore, there is still room for new drugs in this setting, providing that they demonstrate an advantage in terms of efficacy, safety, cost or or simplicity of use. Based on preliminary results, at least for some promising molecules (e.g. miravirsen and RG-101), studies on safety and efficacy on this intriguing class of drugs are needed.
