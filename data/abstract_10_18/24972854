Due to a high rate of relapse, osteomyelitis remains difficult to treat, requiring prolonged parenteral therapy. MICs for 41 consecutive Staphylococcus species recovered from patients with osteomyelitis were determined for dalbavancin, daptomycin, doxycycline, levofloxacin, linezolid, vancomycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, rifampin, and vancomycin. Strains of vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA) and heteroresistant VISA were included for additional comparison. Except for rifampin, dalbavancin was the most active agent tested. Dalbavancin is given once a week, making treatment of infections such as osteomyelitis potentially more convenient and thus could help reduce the rate of hospitalizations and outpatient costs.
