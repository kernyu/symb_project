The present study aimed at identifying single-nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) sites in different coding and non-coding regions of lactoferrin gene in Indian riverine buffaloes. A total of 102 animals from six different river buffalo breeds were screened at six bubaline lactoferrin gene loci. Single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis revealed monomorphic patterns at three loci LtfE2, LtfE11, and LtfE14 while a total of eight distinct patterns were observed in the other three loci viz. LtfE5, LtfE10, and LtfE16 which correspond to respective exons and their flanking regions. Sequence analysis of different SSCP variants revealed the presence of two SNP sites within the coding (exon 16) region and five SNP sites in flanking non-coding regions (intron 4 and intron 9). Both SNPs within exon 16 were found to be synonymous. The SNPs and haplotypes identified in the present study could serve as potential markers for association with susceptibility/resistance to mastitis in buffaloes.
