BACKGROUND: Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is common in HIV-positive individuals and increases liver-related mortality. Nucleos(t)ide analogues with activity against both HBV and HIV are widely used in coinfected patients, but its long-term effect on liver disease is unknown. METHODS: Clinical outcomes, HBsAg and/or HBeAg clearance, and changes in liver stiffness were longitudinally evaluated retrospectively in all HIV-HBV-coinfected individuals followed at our institution. RESULTS: A total of 92 patients with HIV-HBV coinfection were identified, 19 of them superinfected with hepatitis delta virus. Their median time of follow-up was 35 months. Overall, 94% received lamivudine/emtricitabine and 82% tenofovir. Serum HBV-DNA was undetectable in 89%. Seven patients cleared serum HBsAg (2.6/100 patient-years), in four of them accompanied with anti-HBs seroconversion. Of note, two of them had hepatitis delta. Another 11 out of 42 HBeAg-positive patients cleared HBeAg (9/100 patient-years) and five of them experienced anti-HBe seroconversion. Liver decompensation and death occurred in eight (2.9/100 patient-years) and six (2.2/100 patient-years), respectively.At baseline, liver fibrosis was defined as null-mild (48%), moderate-advanced (28%) or cirrhosis (24%). At last visit, after a median of 40 months in 71 patients, 75% showed no changes, whereas improvement was recognized in 17% and worsening in 8%. CONCLUSION: Most HIV-HBV-coinfected patients treated with anti-HBV active nucleos(t)ide analogues experience an amelioration of liver fibrosis progression, with low rates of hepatic decompensation and death. Serum HBeAg or HBsAg seroconversion occurs at yearly rates of 9 and 2.6%, respectively, even in patients with delta hepatitis.
