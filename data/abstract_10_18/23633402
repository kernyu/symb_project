Daily preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) is a novel strategy for preventing human immunodeficiency virus infection. We investigated in macaques whether FTC/TDF prevents transmission of a tenofovir-resistant simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) containing the K65R mutation. Six macaques received weekly a dose of FTC/TDF 3 days before rectal SHIV exposures and a second dose 2 hours after. Six untreated animals were controls. Animals were exposed rectally to escalating virus doses weekly for up to 28 weeks. PrEP significantly delayed infection with SHIVK65R (P = .028), although 4 of 6 FTC/TDF-treated macaques were infected at the end of the challenges. These findings highlight the need to closely monitor PrEP efficacy in areas with prevalent K65R.
