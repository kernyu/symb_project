Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis patients. This study compared the antimicrobial susceptibilities of 153 P. aeruginosa isolates from the United Kingdom (UK) (n = 58), Belgium (n = 44), and Germany (n = 51) collected from 118 patients during routine visits over the period from 2006 to 2012. MICs were measured by broth microdilution. Genes encoding extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL), metallo-beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases were detected by PCR. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing were performed on isolates resistant to >/=3 antibiotic classes among the penicillins/cephalosporins, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and polymyxins. Based on EUCAST/CLSI breakpoints, susceptibility rates were </=30%/</=40% (penicillins, ceftazidime, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin), 44 to 48%/48 to 63% (carbapenems), 72%/72% (tobramycin), and 92%/78% (colistin) independent of patient age. Sixty percent of strains were multidrug resistant (MDR; European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control criteria). Genes encoding the most prevalent ESBL (BEL, PER, GES, VEB, CTX-M, TEM, SHV, and OXA), metallo-beta-lactamases (VIM, IMP, and NDM), or carbapenemases (OXA-48 and KPC) were not detected. The Liverpool epidemic strain (LES) was prevalent in UK isolates only (75% of MDR isolates). Four MDR sequence type 958 (ST958) isolates were found to be spread over the three countries. The other MDR clones were evidenced in </=3 isolates and localized in a single country. A new sequence type (ST2254) was discovered in one MDR isolate in Germany. Clonal and nonclonal isolates with different susceptibility profiles were found in 20 patients. Thus, resistance and MDR are highly prevalent in routine isolates from 3 countries, with meropenem, tobramycin, and colistin remaining the most active drugs.
