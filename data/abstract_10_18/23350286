Eleven articles are included in this special issue of Harefuah dedicated to pediatric infectious diseases. Herein, they present the problems and dilemmas pediatricians, as well as general practitioners, face in current practice.

Additional efforts are urgently needed including judicious use of antibiotics to reduce resistance, development of modern vaccines and antibiotics and public health measures in order to overcome the battle against infections. This can be possible only with robust governmental support.
