Diseases caused by bacteria are today one of the great problems of present time. Access to over-the-counter medication, the indiscriminate use of antibacterials and high rates of hospitalization have contributed to the increase in cases. This picture has led to the search for new alternative drugs. Thus, secondary metabolites have been reported as a possible treatment option, being evidenced in many researches to ascertain their combination with existing drugs. This research aimed to evaluate the antibacterial effect and the antibiotic activity modifying action of the catechin compound against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus multiresistant strains. The determination of the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and the evaluation of the antimicrobial and potentiating effect were performed by broth microdilution. The MIC obtained forcatechin against all the used strains was indicated as not clinically relevant. The combination of catechin and antibacterial drugs, both Gram-negative and Gram-positive, was synergistic and antagonistic in some drugs. Therefore, phenolic compounds can assist in the fight against infections caused by bacteria.
