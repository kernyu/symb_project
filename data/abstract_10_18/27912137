A continuous two-phase partitioning bioreactor (C-TPPB), operated with coiled tubing made of the DuPont polymer Hytrel 8206, was tested for the bioremediation of 4-chlorophenol, as a model toxic compound. The tubing was immersed in the aqueous phase, with the contaminated water flowing tube-side, and an adapted microbial culture suspended in the bioreactor itself, with the metabolic demand of the cells creating a concentration gradient to cause the substrate to diffuse into the bioreactor for biodegradation. The system was operated over a range of loadings (tubing influent concentration 750-1500 mg L(-1)), with near-complete substrate removal in all cases. Distribution of the contaminant at the end of the tests (96 h) highlighted biological removal in the range of 87-95%, while the amount retained in the polymer ranged from approximately 1 to 8%. Mass transfer of the substrate across the tubing wall was not limiting, and the polymer demonstrated the capacity to buffer the substrate loadings and to adapt to microbial metabolism. The impact of C-TPPB operation on biomass activity was also investigated by a kinetic characterization of the microbial culture, which showed better resistance to substrate inhibition after C-TPPB operation, thereby confirming the beneficial effect of sub-inhibitory controlled conditions, characteristic of TPPB systems.
