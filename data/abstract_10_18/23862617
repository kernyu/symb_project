Tuberculosis (TB), an ongoing public health threat, is worsened by the emergence of drug resistance. With an estimated 630000 cases per year of multidrug resistant (MDR)-TB, and 9% of those being extensively drug resistant (XDR)-TB, there is an urgent need for new and more effective anti-TB drugs. New TB treatment regimens should be able to shorten the duration of therapy that currently takes at least six months. The non-compliance with this long treatment duration is one of the reasons for the development of drug resistance. In spite of the difficulties and alleged lack of interest from the pharmaceutical industry for the discovery and development of new antibiotics, several new or repurposed drugs are being evaluated in clinical trials. This review article summarizes the information available and presents an update on the drugs currently in clinical trials for TB and briefly introduces some new compounds in pre-clinical development.
