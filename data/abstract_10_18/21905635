Nosocomial infections caused by multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter pose a serious problem in many countries. This study aimed at determining the antibiotic susceptibility patterns and prevalence of different classes of integrons in isolated Acinetobacter. In addition, the association between production of specific bands in PCR assay and magnitude of multi-drug resistance was investigated. In total, 88 Acinetobacter strains were isolated from patients from October 2008 through September 2009. The Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 12 antibiotics conventionally used in clinics against the isolates, was determined by E-test method. The existence of integron classes was investigated by PCR assay through the amplification of integrase genes. The most effective antibiotic against Acinetobacter was colistin with 97.7% activity, followed by imipenem (77.3%) and meropenem (72.7%). The presence ofintegron classes 1 and 2 in 47 (53.4%) isolates was confirme, However, no class 3 was detected. The proportion of class 1, compared with class 2, was high (47.7% vs. 3.4%). The association between multi-drug resistance to norfloxacin, ceftazidime, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, cefepime and amikacin and the presence of integrons was statistically significant. However, the association was not remarkable in many of the isolates which exhibited resistance to the rest of antibiotics. This may imply that in addition to integrons, other resistance determinants such as transposon and plasmid may also contribute to resistance. To reduce the pressure on sensitive isolates, comprehensive control measures should be implemented. Furthermore, wise application of effective antibiotics could help alleviate the situation. Colistin is the most effective antibiotic in vitro against Acinetobacter.
