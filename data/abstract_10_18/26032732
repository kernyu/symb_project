Leishmania donovani is a unicellular protozoon parasite that causes visceral leishmaniasis (VL), which is a fatal disease if left untreated. Certain Fe-S proteins of the TCA cycle and respiratory chain have been found in the Leishmania parasite but the precise mechanisms for their biogenesis and the maturation of Fe-S clusters remains unknown. Fe-S clusters are ubiquitous cofactors of proteins that perform critical cellular functions. The clusters are biosynthesized by the mitochondrial Iron-Sulphur Cluster (ISC) machinery with core protein components that include the catalytic cysteine desulphurase IscS, the scaffold proteins IscU and IscA, and frataxin as an iron carrier/donor. However, no information regarding frataxin, its regulation, or its role in drug resistance is available for the Leishmania parasite. In this study, we characterized Ld-frataxin to investigate its role in the ISC machinery of L. donovani. We expressed and purified the recombinant Ld-frataxin protein and observed its interaction with Ld-IscU by co-purification and pull-down assay. Furthermore, we observed that the cysteine desulphurase activity of the purified Ld-IscS protein was stimulated in the presence of Ld-frataxin and Ld-IscU, particularly in the presence of iron; neither Ld-frataxin nor Ld-IscU alone had significant effects on Ld-IscS activity. Interestingly, RT-PCR and western blotting showed that Ld-frataxin is upregulated in AmpB-resistant isolates compared to sensitive strains, which may support higher Fe-S protein activity in AmpB-resistant L. donovani. Additionally, Ld-frataxin was localized in the mitochondria, as revealed by digitonin fractionation and indirect immunofluorescence. Thus, our results suggest the role of Ld-frataxin as an iron binding/carrier protein for Fe-S cluster biogenesis that physically interacts with other core components of the ISC machinery within the mitochondria.
