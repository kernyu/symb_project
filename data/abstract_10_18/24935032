The antiviral efficacy of raltegravir (RAL) has been proven against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtypes B and C but remained to be determined against other subtypes. Therefore, the enzymatic activities as well as RAL resistance of HIV-1 subtype A and CRF01_AE integrases (INs) were investigated. Previously published subtype A and CRF01_AE IN sequences from RAL-naive patients were aligned to generate consensus sequences for both IN subtypes. Subtype A and CRF01_AE INs encoded by these consensus sequences as well as the corresponding enzymes harbouring the N155H resistance mutation were expressed and purified. Enzymatic activities of subtype A and CRF01_AE INs were analysed with regard to typical 3'-end processing (3'-P) and strand transfer (ST) activities both in the presence and absence of RAL and were compared with subtype B IN as well as with the corresponding INs harbouring the N155H resistance mutation. Subtypes B, A and CRF01_AE INs showed similar 3'-P and ST activities. In the presence of RAL, the three wild-type INs exhibited ST activity IC50 values (50% inhibitory concentrations) of 86.3 +/- 32.5, 158.3 +/- 99.0 and 100.0 +/- 65.7 nM, respectively. Analysis of 3'-P activity in the presence of RAL revealed IC(50) > 10 muM for all three enzymes. The three INs harbouring the N155H mutation presented in vitro low but similar resistance levels to RAL. In conclusion, INs from HIV-1 subtypes B, A and CRF01_AE showed similar responses to RAL in vitro, suggesting the potency of this antiretroviral drug to treat HIV-1 subtype A- and CRF01_AE-infected patients.
