OBJECTIVE: Recently, we have reported the role of baseline gag cleavage site mutations on the virological outcome of a dual-boosted protease inhibitor regimen in antiretroviral-naive patients (2IP-ANRS 127 trial). The objective of this substudy was to characterize, in patients experiencing virological failure, from the 2IP-ANRS 127 trial, the viral quasispecies present at baseline and at virological failure in gag cleavage site, in gag-pol frameshift and in protease-coding region. METHODS: In four patients, we analysed by clonal analysis the viral population in gag cleavage site (p17/p24, p24/p2, p2/p7, p7/p1, p1/p6(gag)), in p6(gag), in gag-pol frameshift [p1/transframe protein (TFP)/p6(pol)] and in protease-coding region. RESULTS: Clonal analysis of protease-coding region failed to detect major as well as minor protease inhibitor resistance-associated mutations in all four patients. In one patient, a I15V-mutated variant increased from 13 to 100% between baseline and week 24. Clonal analysis of gag and gag-pol cleavage site showed an increase in specific viral populations in p2/p7 cleavage site between baseline and virological failure in three patients. Among them, we described in one patient, that the predominant population at virological failure harboured in p2/p7 and TFP/p6(pol)-specific genotypic profiles associated with duplication of the P(T)APP motif in p6(gag) and the I15V protease mutation on the same individual molecular clones. CONCLUSION: We highlighted the emergence of minority viral populations in the p2/p7 cleavage site between baseline and virological failure. In addition, we showed the association of a specific protease mutation with gag and gag-pol cleavage site substitutions, suggesting their possible role in virological outcome.
