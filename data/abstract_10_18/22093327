BACKGROUND/AIMS: As there are concerns about potential nephrotoxicity of nucleotide analogues, we evaluated renal function parameters during long-term adefovir and lamivudine combination therapy. METHODS: Forty-six HBeAg-negative patients with lamivudine-resistance treated with adefovir and lamivudine for up to 90 months were included. Renal function was assessed by estimated creatinine clearance (eC(CR) ) and compared with a matched control group of untreated inactive hepatitis B virus carriers. RESULTS: Serum HBV DNA became undetectable in 39 (85%) patients after a mean of 37 +/- 21 months. Three (6.5%) patients developed virological breakthrough. Adefovir resistance was detected in two patients. At the end of follow up, there was a significant decrease in mean eC(CR) (95 +/- 31-83 +/- 30 ml/min, P = 0.003) in the treated patients with 16% presenting aeC(CR) decrease >30%. Similar changes in eC(CR) were observed in the control group (108 +/- 28-96 +/- 26 ml/min, P = 0.003). In multiple regression analysis, age and baseline eC(CR) were independent predictors of eC(CR) reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Adefovir and lamivudine combination therapy is not an independent factor for significant renal dysfunction in HBeAg-negative patients with lamivudine-resistance. Baseline age and creatinine clearance are the only independent predictors of worsening renal function.
