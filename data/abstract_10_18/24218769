The treatment and prevention of antimicrobial resistant bacterial infections are critical in the management and maintenance of high-quality clinical health services. Surveillance of antimicrobial resistant bacteria is a useful tool for controlling resistant pathogens. In order to prevent the spread of antimicrobial resistant pathogens in a region, surveillance data should be shared among the hospitals in the same area. In Oita Prefecture, 17 hospitals share antimicrobial resistant bacteria surveillance data. The collected data of the 17 hospitals is valuable in determining the isolation rate of antimicrobial resistant bacteria, such as MRSA, MDRP, and MDRA which are important for hospital acquired infections. This information also provides beneficial knowledge for empiric therapy against infectious diseases. However, further efforts are necessary in sharing the surveillance data among hospitals and collecting more detailed data. It is very important for the hospitals to agree on purpose of sharing the antimicrobial resistant bacterial surveillance data.
