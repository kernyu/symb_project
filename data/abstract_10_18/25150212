Our study showed the antibiotic susceptibility profile of toxigenic Clostridium difficile isolated from nosocomial and community-acquired CDI between 2008 and 2010. MICs of 200 C. difficile strains were determined using E(R)test method in the case of erythromycin, clindamycin, moxifloxacin, rifampicin, and metronidazole. All strains were susceptible to metronidazole in the study period. Resistance rates to erythromycin, clindamycin and moxifloxacin were 31%, 29.5%, and 21.5%, respectively. In the case of rifampicin, the MIC range was quite wide, 11.5% of the tested strains proved to be highly resistant (MIC>/=32 mug/ml) to rifampicin. When we compared these results with our earlier findings from 2006 to 2007, only minor changes in susceptibility over the time-periods could be observed in the case of erythromycin, clindamycin, moxifloxacin, and rifampicin, but metronidazole susceptibility did not show changes.
