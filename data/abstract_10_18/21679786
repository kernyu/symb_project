Resistance to antimicrobial drugs is increasing at an alarming rate among both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Traditionally, bacteria resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents have been restricted to the nosocomial environment. A disturbing trend has been the recent emergence and spread of resistant pathogens in nursing homes, in the community, and in the hospital. This article reviews the epidemiology, molecular mechanisms of resistance, and treatment options for pathogens resistant to antimicrobial drugs.
