Multidrug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa has frequently been reported as the cause of nosocomial outbreaks of burn wound infections. The pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa is partly due to the production of several cell-associated and extracellular virulence factors. A total of 93 P. aeruginosa isolated from burn wound infections were investigated for antimicrobial susceptibility and distribution of virulence genes. All (100%) isolates were resistant to one or more antimicrobial agents. The most frequent resistance found against ampicillin (91.4%), co-trimoxazole (77.4%), gentamicin (68.8%), cefotaxime (50.5%), aztreonam and piperacillin (41.9%). A total of 88 (94.6%) isolates were resistant to at least three different classes of antimicrobial agents and considered as multidrug resistance MDR. All isolates carried at least two or more different virulence genes. The most prevalent virulence gene was toxA (97.8%), followed by plcH (96.7%), phzI (96.7%), exoY (93.1%) and phzII (90.3%). exoU was not detected in P. aeruginosa isolates. The frequency of pilB (17.2%), exoT (20.4%), pilA (24.7%) and phzS/phzH (27.9%) was lower than other virulence genes. Twenty nine (31.2%) isolates had simultaneously 8 virulence genes, 22 (23.7%) isolates had 6 virulence genes and 19 (20.4%) isolates had 7 virulence genes. All MDR isolates carried at least 5 virulence factors. These results indicate a high frequency and heterogeneity of virulence gene profiles among multidrug resistant P. aeruginosa isolates recovered from burn wound infections. Therefore, appropriate surveillance and control measures are essential to prevent the further spread of these isolates in hospitals.
