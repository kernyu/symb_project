This work revealed peanut seed prolamins likely displaying a defensive role besides the known nitrogen storage. Drought stress and proteomic approaches were used in varieties of peanuts to explore the prolamin member in association with a test against Aspergillus flavus spore germination. The stress effect was showed by aerial biomass, leaf content of malondialdehyde, and seed contamination by A. flavus. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis profiles were not informative for the antifungal polypeptides. From two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, the suspected polypeptides were those with pI 5.45-5.75 and sizes of 22.0-30.5 kDa specifically in Spanish-type peanuts. Regarding to the drought effect in most of these peanuts, the spot peak volume analysis deduced three novel prolamin-related antifungal polypeptides at pI 5.75-5.8 with 30.5, 27.5-28.5, and 22.0-22.5 kDa, which was confirmed after isoelectric purification at pH 5.60. The data could not yet conclude their correlation with resistance to drought and to seed infection by A. flavus.
