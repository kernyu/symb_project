Five strains of Streptomyces (CAI-17, CAI-68, CAI-78, KAI-26, and KAI-27) were previously reported to have potential for charcoal rot control and plant growth promotion (PGP) in sorghum. In this study, those 5 Streptomyces strains were characterized for their enzymatic activities and evaluated for their PGP capabilities on rice. All the Streptomyces strains were able to produce lipase and beta-1,3-glucanase; grew in NaCl (up to 8%), at pH 5-13, and at temperatures 20-40 degrees C; and were resistant to ampicillin, sensitive to nalidixic acid, and highly sensitive to chloramphenicol, kanamycin, streptomycin, and tetracycline. They were highly tolerant to the fungicide bavistin but were highly sensitive to benlate, benomyl, and radonil. When evaluated on rice in the field, Streptomyces significantly enhanced tiller and panicle numbers, stover and grain yields, dry matter, root length, volume and dry weight, compared with the control. In the rhizosphere at harvest, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, dehydrogenase activity, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, and % organic carbon were also found significantly higher in Streptomyces-treated plots than in the control plots. This study further confirms that the selected Streptomyces have PGP activities.
