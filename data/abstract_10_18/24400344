Gonorrhoea is a major public health concern globally. Of particularly grave concern is that resistance to the extended-spectrum cephalosporins has emerged during the most recent years. This guideline provides recommendations regarding the diagnosis and treatment of gonorrhoea in Europe. Compared to the outdated 2009 European gonorrhoea guideline, this 2012 European gonorrhoea guideline provides up-to-date guidance on, broader indications for testing and treatment of gonorrhoea;the introduction of dual antimicrobial therapy (ceftriaxone 500 mg and azithromycin 2 g) for uncomplicated gonorrhoea when the antimicrobial sensitivity is unknown; recommendation of test of cure in all gonorrhoea cases to ensure eradication of infection and identify emerging resistance; and recommendations to identify, verify and report failures with recommended treatment regimens. Optimisations of the testing, diagnostics, antimicrobial treatment and follow-up of gonorrhoea patients are crucial in controlling the emergent spread of cephalosporin-resistant and multidrug-resistant gonorrhoea.
