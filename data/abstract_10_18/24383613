Trichosporon species are rare etiologic agents of invasive fungal infection in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. We report 2 well-documented cases of Trichosporon inkin invasive infection in SOT patients. We also conducted a detailed literature review of Trichosporon species infections in this susceptible population. We gathered a total of 13 cases of Trichosporon species infections. Any type of organ transplantation can be complicated by Trichosporon infection. Bloodstream infections and disseminated infections were the most common clinical presentations. Liver recipients with bloodstream or disseminated infections had poor prognoses. Although the most common species was formerly called Trichosporon beigelii, this species name should no longer be used because of the changes in the taxonomy of this genus resulting from the advent of molecular approaches, which were also used to identify the strains isolated from our patients. Antifungal susceptibility testing highlights the possibility of multidrug resistance. Indeed, Trichosporon has to be considered in cases of breakthrough infection or treatment failure under echinocandins or amphotericin therapy. Voriconazole seems to be the best treatment option.
