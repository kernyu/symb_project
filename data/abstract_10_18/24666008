Biomaterial-associated infections remain a serious concern in modern healthcare. The development of materials that can resist or prevent bacterial attachment constitutes a promising approach to dealing with this problem. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and enzymes have been recognized as promising candidates for the new generation of antimicrobial surfaces. AMPs have been the focus of great interest in recent years owing to a low propensity for developing bacterial resistance, broad-spectrum activity, high efficacy at very low concentrations, target specificity, and synergistic action with classical antibiotics. Biofilm-dispersing enzymes have been shown to inhibit biofilm formation, detach established biofilm, and increase biofilm susceptibility to other antimicrobials. This review critically examines the potential of these protein-like compounds for developing antibacterial coatings by reporting their immobilization into different substrata using different immobilization strategies.
