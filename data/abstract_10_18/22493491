Insulin resistance is a risk factor for non-response to interferon/ribavirin therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C. The aim of this study was to determine the role played by protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) in the absence of interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) response associated with insulin resistance. We induced insulin resistance by silencing IRS-2 or by treating HepG2 cells with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) and analyzed insulin response by evaluating Akt phosphorylation and IFNalpha response by measuring Stat-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthase and myxovirus resistance gene expression. The response to IFNalpha was also measured in insulin-resistant obese mice (high fat diet and ob/ob mice) untreated and treated with metformin. Silencing IRS-2 mRNA induces insulin resistance and inhibits IFNalpha response. Likewise, TNFalpha suppresses insulin and IFNalpha response. Treatment of cells with pervanadate and knocking down PTP-1B restores insulin and IFNalpha response. Both silencing IRS-2 and TNFalpha treatment increase PTP and PTP-1B activity. Metformin inhibits PTP and improves IFNalpha response in insulin-resistant cells. Insulin-resistant ob/ob mice have increased PTP-1B gene expression and activity in the liver and do not respond to IFNalpha administration. Treatment with metformin improves this response. In HepG2 cells, insulin resistance provokes IFNalpha resistance, which is associated with an increased PTP-1B activity in the liver. Inhibition of PTP-1B activity with pervanadate and metformin or knocking down PTP-1B reestablishes IFNalpha response. Likewise, metformin decreases PTP-1B activity and improves response to IFNalpha in insulin-resistant obese mice. The use of PTP-1B inhibitors may improve the response to IFNalpha/ribavirin therapy.
