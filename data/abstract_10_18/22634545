Most antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have shown clear activity related to the disruption of lipid bilayers. In order to improve knowledge of this subject, the interaction of Magainin I (MagI) with phospholipid layers (PLs), uncoated or coated with synperonic (Synp), was studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) techniques. MagI peptide was immobilized on gold electrode via a self-assembling monolayer obtained from liposomes and liposomes covered by Synp. MagI induces pores in the supported lipid membranes, which are reflected in an increased amperometric-response and also a decreased electron-transfer resistance (R(CT)). In addition, MagI showed a significant interaction with the PL-Synp-modified gold electrode, but MagI showed a reliable contact with the PL-modified gold electrode, leading to a decrease in the relative resistance charge transfer value of -17.38%. Our results demonstrated that Synp acts as a membrane sealant after exposure of the lipid membrane to MagI. A parallel reaction model was proposed for the interaction of MagI and a hybrid layer that result in a complex bimolecular interaction. In short, the importance of triblock copolymer to stabilize liposomes for future applications as drug delivery systems for MagI was demonstrated.
