We describe a calorimetric assay for detection of voriconazole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus within 8 h. Among 27 genetically distinct strains, all 21 resistant and all 6 susceptible strains were correctly identified by measurement of fungal heat production in the presence of voriconazole. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the potential of microcalorimetry for rapid detection of azole resistance in A. fumigatus.
