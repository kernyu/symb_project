Aureobasidium pullulans is an unusual agent of phaeohyphomycosis. The in vitro activities of antifungals against 104 isolates of Aureobasidium pullulans var. pullulans and A. pullulans var. melanigenum revealed low MIC90s of amphotericin B, posaconazole, and itraconazole. However, they were resistant to fluconazole (>/=64 mug/ml) and had high MICs of voriconazole, isavuconazole, caspofungin, and micafungin.
