The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter of the food yeast Candida utilis strain NRRL Y-660 was cloned to create a novel integrative vector for Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. The new binary vector harbors beta-glucuronidase activity as reporter and kanamicin/geneticin resistance as selection marker. Recombinant clones of A. tumefaciens show kanamycin resistance and high beta-glucuronidase activity under the control of the C. utilis promoter. This finding can be explained by the presence of a prokaryotic core in the yeast promoter, predicted by in silico analysis of the sequence. This is the first report about functionality of a yeast promoter in A. tumefaciens.
