Infections due to carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae represent an emerging threat due to the high mortality rate and lack of valid antimicrobial combinations, especially when the strain is colistin-resistant. We report a case of bloodstream infection due to pandrug-resistant K. pneumoniae treated successfully with an innovative regimen comprising a combination of colistin plus double carbapenem, along with an in vitro analysis showing the synergistic and bactericidal effect.
