Acinetobacter baumannii is emerging with resistance to polymyxins. In 24-h time-kill experiments, high-dose ampicillin-sulbactam in combination with meropenem and polymyxin B achieved additivity or synergy against 10(8) CFU/ml of two clinical A. baumannii isolates resistant to all three drugs (maximum reductions, 1.6 and 3.1 logs). In a 14-day hollow-fiber infection model, high-dose ampicillin-sulbactam (8/4 g every 8 h, respectively) in combination with meropenem (2 g every 8 h) and polymyxin B (1.43 mg/kg of body weight every 12 h with loading dose) resulted in rapid (96 h) eradication of A. baumannii.
