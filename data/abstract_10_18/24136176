AmpC beta-lactamase confers resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in many Gram negative bacteria. Inducible expression of AmpC requires an N-acetylglucosaminidase termed NagZ. Here we describe the synthesis and characterization of hydroxyazepane inhibitors of NagZ. We find that these inhibitors enhance the susceptibility of clinically relevant Pseudomonas aeruginosa to beta-lactams.
