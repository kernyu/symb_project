The continuous evolvement of bacterial resistance to most, if not all currently available antibiotics is a worldwide problem. These strains, frequently isolated from military-associated environments, have created an urgent need to develop supplementary anti-infective modalities. One of the leading directions is phage therapy, which includes the administration of bacteriophages, viruses that specifically target bacteria, as bio-therapies. Though neglected in the West until recent years, bacteriophages have been widely studied and clinically administered in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe for over a century, where they were found to be incredibly efficient at battling numerous infectious diseases.In this review, we will discuss the high potential of phage therapy as a solution for resistant bacterial infectious diseases relating to military medicine. By describing the historical development and knowledge acquired on phage therapy, we will define the advantages of bacteriophages for combating resistant bacteria in multiple settings, such as trauma injuries, foodborne illnesses, as a preventative tool and therapy against biological warfare agents, and more. We will also present the most recent successful clinical applications of bacteriophages in military settings worldwide.We believe that augmenting military medicine by integrating Phage Therapy is an important and required step in preparedness for the rapidly approaching post-antibiotic era.
