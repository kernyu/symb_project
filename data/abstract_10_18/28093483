Background: Combination ART (cART)-related toxicities and costs have prompted the need for treatment simplification. The ATLAS-M trial explored 48 week non-inferior efficacy of simplification to atazanavir/ritonavir + lamivudine versus maintaining three-drug atazanavir/ritonavir-based cART in virologically suppressed patients. Methods: We performed an open-label, multicentre, randomized, non-inferiority study, enrolling HIV-infected adults on atazanavir/ritonavir + two NRTIs, with stable HIV-RNA <50 copies/mL and CD4 + >200 cells/mm 3 . Main exclusion criteria were hepatitis B virus coinfection, past virological failure on or resistance to study drugs, recent AIDS and pregnancy. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to either switch to 300 mg of atazanavir/100 mg of ritonavir once daily and 300 mg of lamivudine once daily (atazanavir/ritonavir + lamivudine arm) or to continue the previous regimen (atazanavir/ritonavir + two NRTIs arm). The primary study outcome was the maintenance of HIV-RNA <50 copies/mL at week 48 of the ITT-exposed (ITT-e) analysis with switch = failure. The non-inferiority margin was 12%. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01599364. Results: Between July 2011 and June 2014, 266 patients were randomized (133 to each arm). After 48 weeks, the primary study outcome was met by 119 of 133 patients (89.5%) in the atazanavir/ritonavir + lamivudine arm and 106 of 133 patients (79.7%) in the atazanavir/ritonavir + two NRTIs arm [difference atazanavir/ritonavir + lamivudine versus atazanavir/ritonavir + two NRTIs arm: +9.8% (95% CI + 1.2 to + 18.4)], demonstrating non-inferiority and superior efficacy of the atazanavir/ritonavir + lamivudine arm. Virological failure occurred in two (1.5%) patients in the atazanavir/ritonavir + lamivudine arm and six (4.5%) patients in the atazanavir/ritonavir + two NRTIs arm, without resistance selection. A similar proportion of adverse events occurred in both arms. Conclusions: Treatment simplification to atazanavir/ritonavir + lamivudine showed non-inferior efficacy (superiority on post-hoc analysis) and a comparable safety profile over continuing atazanavir/ritonavir + two NRTIs in virologically suppressed patients.
