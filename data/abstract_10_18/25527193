BACKGROUND: This study investigated the molecular characteristics of azithromycin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae in Taiwan. METHODS: A total of 486 non-duplicate isolates of azithromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae recovered from various clinical sources of patients treated at 22 different hospitals in Taiwan from 2006 to 2010. The presence of erm(B) and mef(A) genes using duplex PCR, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of these isolates were studied. RESULTS: Of the isolates tested, 59% carried the erm(B) gene, 22% carried the mef(A) gene, and 19% carried both genes. The prevalence of isolates carrying the erm(B) and mef(A) genes increased from 10% (11/110) in 2006 to 25% (15/60) in 2010 (p-value = 0.0136). The majority of isolates carrying both erm(B) and mef(A) genes belonged to serotypes 19 F (64%) followed by 19 F A (24%). Of these isolates, 33% were sequence type 320 (ST320), 32% were ST236, and 12% were ST271. CONCLUSIONS: The increase in incidence of mef(A)/erm(B)-positive azithromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates during the study period was primarily due to serotypes 19 F and 19A and ST236 and ST320.
