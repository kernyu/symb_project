The present study was undertaken to select exclusive indigenous actinobacterial probiont for broiler health improvement based on in vitro probiotic potentials. In total, 18 actinobacterial cultures isolated from chicken were screened for survivability (resistance to low pH, pepsin, bile and pancreatin), colonization (auto-aggregation, hydrophobicity and co-aggregation) and safety (antibiotic susceptibility and non-haemolytic activity). Ten cultures showed excellent viability at pH 2 and most of the acid-tolerant isolates exhibited resistance to pepsin (3 mg/mL), bile (0.3%) and pancreatin (1 mg/mL). Besides, the examined isolates displayed efficient adhesion properties. All the isolates were susceptible to 9 different antibiotics and none of them exhibited beta-haemolytic activity. Moreover, the culture JD9 revealed remarkable probiotic features compared to the other isolates, which was identified as Streptomyces sp. JD9 (KF878075). Taken together, the present study suggests that the probiont Streptomyces sp. JD9 could potentially be used in broiler practices as a feed additive to facilitate enhanced broiler production.
