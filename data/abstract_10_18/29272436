Objectives: Broad-spectrum antimicrobial resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PSA) isolates is a growing concern as our therapeutic options have become significantly limited. Although ceftolozane/tazobactam (C/T) has been shown to be highly active against MDR PSA pathogens, combination regimens are often employed in real-world settings. To assist the clinical decision-making process regarding the selection of combination antibiotics and dosages for this pathogen, we performed time-kill studies assessing clinical free peak and trough C/T concentrations alone and in combination with eight anti-pseudomonal agents against four clinical MDR PSA isolates. Methods: Time-kill analyses were performed over 24 h in duplicate using C/T concentrations reflective of the free peak concentrations of a 3 g dose every 8 h (q8h; 120/25.2 mg/L) and the peak and trough of a 1.5 g q8h dose (60/12.6 and 7.5/1.6 mg/L) in humans. The activity of C/T 120, 60 and 7.5 mg/L alone and C/T 7.5 mg/L in combination with free peak and trough concentrations of clinical doses for cefepime, ciprofloxacin, colistin, aztreonam, meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, fosfomycin and amikacin was tested for all isolates. Results: C/T 3 and 1.5 g q8h peak concentrations demonstrated killing against the MDR PSA. Colistin and fosfomycin were synergistic with C/T as dual therapy and triple therapy regimens. Conclusions: As a result of escalating resistance, PSA is an increasingly challenging pathogen in the clinical setting. Our findings aid in the identification of novel treatment options using achievable drug exposures for the treatment of MDR PSA.
