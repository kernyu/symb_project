Background: Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) account for a significant burden of infection and colonization in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), and antibiotic resistance among these pathogens is of increasing concern. Methods: A prospective cohort study was performed in 4 NICUs between May 2009 and April 2012. The body sites from which GNB were isolated, antimicrobial susceptibilities of the GNB isolated, and antimicrobial therapy were assessed. Results: Attending neonatologists treated 3.0% (188 of 6184) of eligible infants for GNB infection; 23% of 214 GNB isolates were nonsusceptible to antimicrobial agents, including gentamicin (14.8%), piperacillin-tazobactam (9.9%), third-generation cephalosporin (7.0%), and/or carbapenem agents (4.5%). Gentamicin was the most commonly used antibiotic overall, and much of its use was empiric. However, third-generation cephalosporin agents and cefepime were used more commonly as targeted therapy for identified Gram-negative pathogens. Conclusions: One-quarter of the GNB isolates were nonsusceptible to >/=1 antibiotic. Antimicrobial stewardship strategies for reducing antimicrobial use in NICUs should be implemented.
