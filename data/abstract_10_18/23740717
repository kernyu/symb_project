Here, we summarize the discussions and conclusions from an expert workshop held in October 2012 to consider the implications of HIV drug resistance in the context of scale-up of access to antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis in resource-limited settings. Topics considered during the workshop included the implications of drug resistance for the selection of first-line regimens and sequencing of treatments, optimal surveillance strategies and prevention of mother-to-child transmission.
