AIM: This article proposes a description of French regional consumption of antibiotics with a bacterial resistance risk (amoxicillin+clavulanic acid, third-generation cephalosporins [C3G] and fluoroquinolones). METHODS: Antibiotics reimbursements data were obtained by Open Medic website. The antibiotic consumption profile has been established using some indicators of the European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption (ESAC) in daily-defined dose per 1000 inhabitants per day (DID) or in percentage. RESULTS: Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur-Corse (34.4 DID) and Midi-Pyrenees-Languedoc-Roussillon (33.5 DID) consume the most of both, systemic antibiotics and antibiotics with a bacterial resistance risk. Pays-de-la-Loire (26.7 DID), Bretagne (29.1 DID), Centre-Val-de-Loire (29.7 DID) et Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes (29.7 DID) consume the less of both, systemic antibiotics and antibiotics with a bacterial resistance risk. CONCLUSION: Even if some environmental and socioeconomic factors could explain variabilities between regions, a link between consumption intensity and misuse is not excluded.
