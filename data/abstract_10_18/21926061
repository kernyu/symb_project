The increasing resistance of microorganisms to a range of antibiotics is of growing concern to healthcare professionals world wide. A correlation between antibiotic resistance and high prescribing rates has long been established. However, despite numerous awareness campaigns, antibiotic prescribing rates are still high and increasing in many countries including the UK. The European Antibiotic Awareness Day on 18 November 2011 provides a platform to remind prescribers and the general public about the dangers of antibiotic overuse. The key message is to encourage prudent antibiotic prescribing so that antibiotics remain a safe and effective resource for the future.
