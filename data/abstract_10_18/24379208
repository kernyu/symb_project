The methylenecyclopropane nucleoside (MCPN) analogs synguanol and its 6-alkoxy (MBX2168) and 6-alkylthio (MBX1616) derivatives retained good in vitro activities against several common ganciclovir-resistant UL97 kinase variants of human cytomegalovirus. Foscarnet-MCPN cross-resistance was observed among UL54 polymerase variants. UL54 exonuclease domain ganciclovir-cidofovir dual-resistant variants were remarkably more hypersensitive to these MCPNs than to cyclopropavir, with some 50% effective concentration ratios that were <0.1x the wild type. Different categories of MCPNs may have therapeutically exploitable mechanistic differences in viral DNA polymerase inhibition.
