A surface water isolate of Raoultella sp. having both multidrug- and multimetal-resistant ability was isolated and identified as Raoultella planticola. R. planticola displayed resistance to 15 drugs like ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, aztreonam, erythromycin, imipenem, oxacillin, pefloxacin, penicillin, piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, rifampin, sulbactam/cefoperazone, ticarsillin, ticarsillin/clavulanic acid, vancomycin, and to 11 heavy metals like aluminum, barium, copper, iron, lead, lithium, manganese, nickel, silver, strontium, and tin. The multidrug and multi-metal-resistant R. planticola may remain present in the environment for a long time. Due to a possible health risk of these pathogenic bacteria, a need exists for an accurate assessment of their acquired resistance to multiple drugs and metals.
