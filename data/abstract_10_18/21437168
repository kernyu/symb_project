BACKGROUND/AIMS: We evaluated the clinical features of ciprofloxacin-resistant Proteus mirabilis bacteremia and risk factors for ciprofloxacin resistance. METHODS: From October 2000 to July 2009, 37 patients with clinically significant P. mirabilis bacteremia were identified and data from patients with ciprofloxacin-resistant and ciprofloxacin-susceptible P. mirabilis bacteremia were compared. RESULTS: The most common underlying diseases were neurologic disease (37.8%) and solid tumors (29.7%). The most common site of infection was the urinary tract (35.1%). Ten of the 37 patients (27.0%) were infected with ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates, and univariate analysis revealed a significant relationship between ciprofloxacin-resistant P. mirabilis bacteremia and neurologic disease, recent operation, L-tube insertion, percutaneous tube use, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production (all p < 0.05). ESBL was detected in six of 10 (60%) ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates, while only three of 27 (11%) ciprofloxacin-susceptible isolates produced ESBL (p = 0.005). In a logistic regression analysis, ESBL production remained a significant factor associated with ciprofloxacin resistance, after adjusting for other variables. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate a close association between ciprofloxacin resistance and ESBL-production in P. mirabilis bacteremia. This association is particularly troublesome because the therapeutic options for serious infections caused by ESBL-producing P. mirabilis are severely restricted.
