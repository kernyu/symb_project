Decreased cellular accumulation of cisplatin is a frequently observed mechanism of resistance to the drug. Beside passive diffusion, several cellular proteins using ATP hydrolysis as an energy source are assumed to be involved in cisplatin transport in and out of the cell. This investigation aimed at clarifying the contribution of intracellular ATP as an indicator of energy-dependent transport to cisplatin resistance using the A2780 human ovarian adenocarcinoma cell line and its cisplatin-resistant variant A2780cis. Depletion of intracellular ATP with oligomycin significantly decreased cellular platinum accumulation (measured by flameless atomic absorption spectrometry) in sensitive but not in resistant cells, and did not affect cisplatin efflux in both cell lines. Inhibition of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase with ouabain reduced platinum accumulation in A2780 cells but to a lesser extent compared with oligomycin. Western blot analysis revealed lower expression of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase alpha(1) subunit in resistant cells compared with sensitive counterparts. The basal intracellular ATP level (determined using a bioluminescence-based assay) was significantly higher in A2780cis cells than in A2780 cells. Our results highlight the importance of ATP-dependent transport, among other processes mediated by Na(+),K(+)-ATPase, for cisplatin influx in sensitive cells. Cellular platinum accumulation in resistant cells is reduced and less dependent on energy sources, which may partly result from Na(+),K(+)-ATPase downregulation. Our data suggest the involvement of other ATP-dependent processes beside those regulated by Na(+),K(+)-ATPase. Higher basal ATP level in cisplatin-resistant cells, which appears to be a consequence of enhanced mitochondrial ATP production, may represent a survival mechanism established during development of resistance.
