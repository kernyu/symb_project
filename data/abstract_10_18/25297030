Thermophilic Campylobacter are commonly associated with poultry as commensals of the avian gut and are the causative agent responsible for human Campylobacteriosis. This study aimed to establish the prevalence of Campylobacter spp. from environmental sources that have previously been implicated as sources of horizontal transmission. The highest prevalence of thermophilic Campylobacter was found in water samples (87.5%) and lowest from flies (7.2%). Only C. jejuni was isolated from all sources. A secondary aim was to provide a baseline of resistance profiles of Campylobacter spp. isolates obtained. Alarmingly all the C. jejuni isolates from environmental sources as well as humans were multi-drug resistant.
