Background: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is widely performed as a treatment for biliary and pancreatic illness in China; however, there are few data available regarding post-ERCP infections. This study aimed to describe the overall incidence of post-ERCP infections and the epidemiological characteristics of infected patients in a large tertiary-care hospital in China. Methods: Real-time surveillance was performed from 2012 through 2015 to identify all healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) that occurred after ERCP, using an automatic system. All HAIs (e.g., cholangtitis, bacteremia) were identified by infection control practitioners and doctors. Inpatient data were automatically collected by the surveillance system. Results: A total of 1743 ERCP operations were included in the study, among these, 132 (7.57%) HAIs were identified. ERCP postoperative infections occurred following different surgical procedures, with infection rates ranging from 3.58 to 13.51%. The most prevalent HAI was biliary tract infection (4.02%), followed by transient bacteremia (1.14%). Overall, 62 cases of bacteremia occurred following ERCP surgery and 34 (54.84%) cases occurred on the day of the operation or 1-day post-surgery. The most prevalent isolates detected during bacteremia were Enterococcus faecium (12/58) and Escherichia coli (11/58). A large proportion (72.73%) of the E. coli isolates and all of the E. faecium isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin. In addition, only 37.50% of the E. coli isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone. Conclusions: The high incidence of post-ERCP infection and the prevalence of drug resistance suggests that employing second generation cephalosporin or ceftriaxone as the antibiotic of choice for prophylaxis before ERCP, as recommended by the Chinese clinical application of antibacterial drugs guidelines, may not be effective.
