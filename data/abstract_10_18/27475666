INTRODUCTION: Antibiotics are still often inappropriately prescribed in France despite specific measures being taken for over 10years. The 25% decrease in antibiotic prescription advocated in the 2011-2016 National Antibiotic Plan seems difficult to achieve. One of the strategies currently considered in France is the use of a specific prescription form dedicated to antibiotics, with an educational message for patients. We aimed to evaluate the acceptability - by primary care prescribers - of this measure and to evaluate their perception of other antibiotic stewardship strategies. METHODS: Qualitative study conducted among family physicians, pediatricians, dermatologists, dentists, and ENT specialists using semi-structured interviews. A thematic and framework analysis was then performed. RESULTS: Thirty prescribing physicians practicing in a specific region of France were included in the study. The dedicated prescription form for antibiotics was deemed excessive and questionable. Other measures, not directly targeting prescribers, were rather well perceived: the unit sales of antibiotics, the restricted reporting of susceptibility tests, or the limitation of the number of molecules available in outpatient settings. CONCLUSION: The results of this exploratory study may guide the national antibiotic stewardship policy in France.
