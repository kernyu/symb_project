OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to explore how quercetin interacts with pancreatic cancer stem-like cells and the mechanism underlying the effective quercetin-mediated suppression. METHODS: A model of pancreatic cancer stem-like cells was generated by using a sphere formation culture system. A comparative analysis was performed between the parent cells and pancreatic cancer stem-like cells with a related treatment strategy focusing on cancer stem cell (CSC) properties and drug-resistance-related mechanisms in vitro. RESULTS: Our data show that pancreatic cancer stem-like cells have greater resistance to gemcitabine and stronger CSC properties compared with the parent cells. In contrast to the pancreatic cancer stem-like cells, overexpression of beta-catenin was observed in the parent cells. Quercetin suppressed proliferation, invasion and self-renewal capacity, and CSC surface markers expression, with alterations of beta-catenin in pancreatic cancer stem-like cells. The combination of quercetin and gemcitabine can reduce tumor growth and decrease drug resistance in pancreatic cancer. CONCLUSIONS: beta-Catenin plays an important role in maintenance and progression of pancreatic cancer. Targeting beta-catenin using quercetin combined with gemcitabine may be a treatment strategy to improve prognosis in patients with pancreatic cancer.
