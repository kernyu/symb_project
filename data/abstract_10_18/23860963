PURPOSE: Disturbed iron homeostasis contributes to resistance to recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo) in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Increased hepcidin, which downregulates the iron exporter ferroportin, has been incriminated. However, other factors also control ferroportin expression in mononuclear phagocyte system. Ferroportin in monocytes, as well as serum hepcidin, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and common markers of iron status were measured and correlations with rHuEpo resistance index (ERI) were evaluated. METHODS: After a 4-week washout period from iron treatment, 34 HD patients and 20 healthy volunteers enrolled in the study. Ferroportin was assessed by means of western blotting, whereas hepcidin and IL-6 with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Hemoglobin, serum iron, ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) were also measured. RESULTS: Ferroportin in monocytes of HD patients was decreased. Serum hepcidin and IL-6 were increased, whereas serum iron and TSAT were decreased. ERI was negatively correlated with ferroportin and all the markers of iron adequacy, but not with hepcidin. CONCLUSION: Decreased ferroportin in monocytes of HD patients accompanies increased hepcidin, inflammation, decreased iron availability and is correlated with resistance to rHuEpo treatment.
