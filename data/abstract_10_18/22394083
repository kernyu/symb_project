Three hundred eighty-three isolates of Moraxella catarrhalis were collected from healthy children aged less than 2 years in China and assessed for antimicrobial resistance. We found that 92.2% (n=353) produced a beta-lactamase. Nonsusceptibility rates to erythromycin and azithromycin, determined using Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) breakpoints, were 40.3% and 22.5%, respectively; nonsusceptibility rates determined using pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics breakpoints, however, were 59% and 60.1%. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)(90) values were >256 mug/ml. Nonsusceptibility rates varied by region from 9.7% in Dongguan to 75.9% in Jinan. Further, concomitant resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics was also observed. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis of 27/37 high-level macrolide-resistant M. catarrhalis isolates showed that closely related pulsotypes dominated, with a total of 11 different pulsotypes being observed. The closely related pulsotypes were observed in isolates originating from all six Chinese cities investigated, possibly as a consequence of the mobility of the Chinese population. Sixteen patterns of 23S rRNA mutations were found among 97 selected isolates using polymerase chain reaction and sequencing, but no known ermA, ermB, mefA, or mefE genes could be detected. Mutations A2982T and A2796T in 23S rRNA were related to high-level macrolide resistance (MICs ranging from 24 to >256 mug/ml), while an A2983T mutation was associated with low-level macrolide resistance (MICs ranging from 0.19 to 16 mug/ml).
