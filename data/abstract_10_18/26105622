The aim of this study was to determine the antibiotic susceptibility of 93 Lactobacillus strains isolated from domestic geese raised on Polish farms. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 13 antimicrobial substances was determined by the broth microdilution method. All strains were sensitive to the cell wall inhibitors ampicillin and amoxicillin (MIC </= 8 mug/ml). Resistance to inhibitors of protein synthesis and to fluoroquinolone inhibitors of replication was found in 44.1% and 60.2% of isolates, respectively; 26.9% strains were resistant to neomycin (MIC >/= 64 mug/ml), 23.6% to tetracycline (MIC >/= 32 mug/ml), 15% to lincomycin (MIC >/= 64 mug/ml), 18.3% to doxycycline (MIC >/= 32 mug/ml), 9.7% to tylosin (MIC >/= 32 mug/ml), 56% to flumequine (MIC >/= 256 mug/ml) and 22.6% to enrofloxacin (MIC >/= 64 mug/ml). Bimodal distribution of MICs indicative of acquired resistance and unimodal distribution of the high MIC values indicative of intrinsic resistance were correlated with Lactobacillus species. Eleven (11.8%) strains displayed multiple resistance for at least three classes of antibiotics. Data derived from this study can be used as a basis for reviewing current microbiological breakpoints for categorisation of susceptible and resistant strains of Lactobacillus genus and help to assess the hazards associated with the occurrence of drug resistance among natural intestinal microflora.
