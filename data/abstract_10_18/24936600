A comparison of the daclatasvir (DCV [BMS-790052]) resistance barrier on authentic or hybrid replicons containing NS5A from hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes 1 to 6 (GT-1 to -6) was completed using a replicon elimination assay. The data indicated that genotype 1b (GT-1b) has the highest relative resistance barrier and genotype 2a (GT-2a M31) has the lowest. The rank order of resistance barriers to DCV was 1b>4a>/=5a>6a congruent with1a>2a JFH>3a>2a M31. Importantly, DCV in combination with a protease inhibitor (PI) eliminated GT-2a M31 replicon RNA at a clinically relevant concentration. Previously, we reported the antiviral activity and resistance profiles of DCV on HCV genotypes 1 to 4 evaluated in the replicon system. Here, we report the antiviral activity and resistance profiles of DCV against hybrid replicons with NS5A sequences derived from HCV GT-5a and GT-6a clinical isolates. DCV was effective against both GT-5a and -6a hybrid replicon cell lines (50% effective concentrations [EC50s] ranging from 3 to 7 pM for GT-5a, and 74 pM for GT-6a). Resistance selection identified amino acid substitutions in the N-terminal domain of NS5A. For GT-5a, L31F and L31V, alone or in combination with K56R, were the major resistance variants (EC50s ranging from 2 to 40 nM). In GT-6a, Q24H, L31M, P32L/S, and T58A/S were identified as resistance variants (EC50s ranging from 2 to 250 nM). The in vitro data suggest that DCV has the potential to be an effective agent for HCV genotypes 1 to 6 when used in combination therapy.
