The barbel chub Squaliobarbus curriculus is an important commercial fish species in China, and has shown significant resistance to grass carp reovirus (GCRV). In this study, the cDNA sequence of interferon regulatory factors 3 (IRF3) from Squaliobarbus curriculus, designated as ScIRF3, was cloned, and its effect against GCRV was investigated. The full-length 1837 base pair (bp) cDNA of ScIRF3 contained a complete open reading frame of 1374bp and encoded a putative polypeptide of 457 amino acid residues. The ScIRF3 protein contained conserved domains, including an N-terminal DNA-binding domain, a C-terminal IRF association domain, and a serine-rich domain. Phylogenetic analysis showed that ScIRF3 was closely clustered with IRF3s from Carassius auratus and Ctenopharyngodon idellus. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that the expression levels of ScIRF3 in Squaliobarbus curriculus were the highest in the spleen and lowest in the muscle. After GCRV infection, expression levels of both ScIRF3 and type I interferon (IFN) were initially up-regulated and subsequently down-regulated in the spleen and intestine. Correlation analysis showed that the expression level of type I IFN is significantly positively correlated with that of ScIRF3 (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.883, P: 0.004) in the intestine. The expression level of type I IFN was also significantly up-regulated and the GCRV titer was significantly decreased (P<.05) in GCRV-infected ScIRF3-overexpressing Ctenopharyngodon idellus kidney cells. These results indicate that ScIRF3 may play a role in the type I IFN immune response against GCRV in Squaliobarbus curriculus and can also inhibit GCRV replication in Ctenopharyngodon idellus kidney cells.
