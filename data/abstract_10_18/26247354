In this study, we have performed the synthesis of new N'-(arylidene)-4-[(benzothiazol-2-yl)thio]butanoylhydrazide derivatives (3a-s) bearing azole moiety and hydrazone group in a lipophilic structural framework. The target compounds were prepared by a three step synthetic procedure starting from 2-mercaptobenzothiazole. The structures of the target compounds were elucidated by IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR spectra and elemental analysis. The antifungal activity of the obtained compounds has been determined against a number of clinic and fluconazole-resistant Candida strains by using microdilution method. Compounds (3a-3s) exhibited anticandidal activity in different ratios varying between the range of MIC: 50 and 200 microg/mL.
