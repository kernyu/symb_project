We investigated the influence of the quaternary ammonium salt (QAS) called IM (N-(dodecyloxycarboxymethyl)- N,N,N-trimethyl ammonium chloride) on yeast cells of the parental strain and the IM-resistant mutant (EO25 IMR) growth. The phenotype of this mutant was pleiotropic. The IMR mutant exhibited resistance to ethanol, osmotic shock and oxidative stress, as well as increased sensitivity to UV. Moreover, it was noted that mutant EO25 appears to have an increased resistance to clotrimazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole, nystatin and cycloheximide. It also tolerated growth in the presence of crystal violet, DTT and metals (selenium, tin, arsenic). It was shown that the presence of IM decreased ergosterol level in mutant plasma membrane and increased its unsaturation. These results indicate changes in the cell lipid composition. Western blot analysis showed the induction of Pma1 level by IM. RT-PCR revealed an increased PMA1 expression after IM treatment.
