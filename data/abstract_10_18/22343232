Advanced-stage epithelial ovarian cancer remains a highly lethal malignancy, despite effective cytoreductive surgery and primary chemotherapy. Phase III studies have evaluated multidrug combinations, dose-dense weekly scheduling, intraperitoneal delivery, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, maintenance therapy, and targeting of angiogenesis. Incremental gains in median progression-free or overall survival have been achieved, but without an impact on overall mortality. Data support intraperitoneal cisplatin, dose-dense weekly paclitaxel, or neoadjuvant chemotherapy with interval cytoreduction in appropriate patients. Encouraging data have emerged using antiangiogenic agents, but with questions regarding optimal timing and patient selection. The use of 3-drug combinations or maintenance chemotherapy is not supported.
