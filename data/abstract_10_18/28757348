OBJECTIVES: Enterobacter cloacae has recently emerged as an important agent of nosocomial infections owing to the dissemination of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and carbapenemases in this species. In this context, a rise in the therapeutic use of aminoglycosides was noticed, followed by the accelerated development of resistance mechanisms. In this study, we report the draft genome sequence of a multidrug-resistant E. cloacae subsp. cloacae strain (Ec2) isolated from an active surveillance culture of a patient with Chagas disease. METHODS: Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed using a Nextera XT DNA library and NextSeq platform. RESULTS: WGS analysis revealed the presence of 5527 coding genes, 62 RNA-encoding genes and 275 pseudogenes. Strain Ec2 belongs to sequence type 395 (ST395) and carries 22 transferable antibiotic resistance genes, comprising eight antimicrobial classes, including the rmtD2 gene conferring high-level aminoglycoside resistance. CONCLUSIONS: This draft genome can be used in comparative genomic analyses with different E. cloacae strains. In addition, it could help at elucidating epidemiological aspects regarding the dissemination of clinically relevant resistance genes.
