OBJECTIVE: To study the organisms causing early and late onset neonatal sepsis, with special reference to multi-drug resistant gram negative bacilli, at two neonatal units (one urban, one rural) in India. METHODS: Prospective surveillance study. RESULTS: There were 159 episodes of sepsis (81 urban and 77 rural) affecting 158 babies. Gram negative bacilli caused 117 infections (68%) and predominated at both centres in both early and late sepsis. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the commonest organism, causing 61 infections (38.3%). In early sepsis (0-2 days), non-fermenting gram negative bacilli caused 42.1% of infections at the urban centre; there were no cases of early Group B Streptococcus sepsis. Late onset sepsis was mainly caused by gram negative bacilli at both centres. Multi-drug resistance of over 80% of early-onset gram negative organisms to ampicillin, third generation cephalosporins and gentamicin indicates that these multi-resistant organisms are almost certainly circulating widely in the community. The overall mortality from early sepsis was 27.3% (9 of 33) and from late sepsis was 26.2% (33 of 126). Gram negative bacilli caused all deaths from early sepsis and 87.5% of deaths from late sepsis. CONCLUSION: This study shows that multi-drug resistant gram negative bacilli are a major cause of early and late neonatal sepsis in India and are almost certainly widespread in the community.
