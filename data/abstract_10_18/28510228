Overuse and misuse of antibiotics have led bacteria to acquire several mechanisms of resistance. In response to this, researchers have identified natural antimicrobial peptides as promising candidates to fight against multiresistant bacteria. However, their mode of action is still unclear, and a better understanding of the mode of action of these peptides is of primary importance to develop new peptides displaying high antibacterial activity and low hemolytic activity. One of the main features that defines the mechanism of action is the membrane topology of the peptide. Among the spectroscopic techniques, solid-state NMR is the technique of choice for determining the location of the peptide within the membrane. It can be achieved by performing experiments with oriented samples. In the literature, the two most common types of oriented samples are bicelles and phospholipids mechanically oriented between glass plates. The mode of perturbation of the membrane-active peptide can be studied by phosphorus-31 and deuterium NMR. On the other hand, several experiments such as nitrogen-15 and fluorine solid-state NMR, that require labeled peptides, can give valuable information on the membrane topology of the peptide. The combination of the latter techniques allows the determination of a precise topology, thus a better knowledge of the molecular determinants involved in the membrane interactions of antimicrobial peptides.
