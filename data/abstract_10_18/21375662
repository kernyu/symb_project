We describe here the first case of osteitis caused by Candida haemulonii in a young immunocompetent patient. This patient presented a history of severe peripheral vascular disease associated with a lack of hygienic conditions as the only risk factors for such an uncommon infection. Clinical signs and histological examination allowed us to determine that it was a C. haemulonii infection and not colonization. The outcome was favourable with oral voriconazole therapy and surgical revascularization. An environmental cause of such infections is most probable, as C. haemulonii has previously been isolated from different non-human sources. Identification methods, results obtained with three in vitro antifungal susceptibility methods and clinical features are reported.
