We studied in parallel the population structure of 90 carbapenemase-producing and 88 carbapenemase-susceptible Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates collected in 20 Spanish hospitals, in the context of the EuSCAPE project. Fourteen and 50 multilocus sequence types (MLSTs) were detected among the carbapenemase-producing and carbapenem-susceptible isolates, respectively. ST11 and ST15 clones were more frequent in the carbapenemase-producing group than in the carbapenemase-susceptible group (P < 0.0001). Among the members of the carbapenem-suceptible group, the cefotaxime-resistant population showed population parameters that differed between the populations of the wild-type strains and the carbapenemase producers.
