The construction and screening of metagenomic expression libraries has great potential to identify novel genes and their functions. Here, we describe metagenomic library preparation from fecal DNA, screening of libraries for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), massively parallel DNA sequencing of the enriched DNA fragments, and a computational pipeline for high-throughput assembly and annotation of functionally selected DNA.
