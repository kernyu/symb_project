The antibiotic nisin, produced by Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis N8, offers an extensive commercial prospect as natural food preservatives. The nisin immunity of the L. lactis strains is regulated by a variety of mechanisms. In this study, we isolated a L. lactis L31 strain with increased nisin resistance from a mini-Mu transposon mutant pool of strain N8. The single Mu insertion in strain L31 was in the irpT gene with unknown function. By comparing the proteomic profiles of L. lactis L31 and its parental strain, we found that changes occurred in the synthesis of a protein involved in cell wall biosynthesis (RmlD). Strain L31 had 13.7% higher content of rhamnose in the cell wall than the N8 strain. Overexpression of RmlD involved in the synthesis of dTDP-L: -rhamnose in the nisin-sensitive MG1363 strain increased nisin resistance of the strain. The results indicate that these cellular proteins effected nisin resistance in L. lactis N8.
