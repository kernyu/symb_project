Against extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Enterobacter cloacae, combination antibiotic therapy may be the only option. We investigated the activity of various antibiotics in combination with polymyxin B using time-kill studies (TKS). TKS were conducted with four nonclonal XDR E. cloacae isolates with 5 log10 CFU/ml bacteria against maximum, clinically achievable concentrations of polymyxin B alone and in two-drug combinations with 10 different antibiotics. A hollow-fiber infection model (HFIM) simulating clinically relevant polymyxin B and tigecycline dosing regimens was conducted for two isolates over 240 h. Emergence of resistance was quantified using antibiotic-containing (3x MIC) media. Biofitness and stability of resistant phenotypes were determined. All XDR E. cloacae isolates were resistant to all antibiotics except for polymyxin B (polymyxin B MIC, 1 to 4 mg/liter). All isolates harbored metallo-beta-lactamases (two with NDM-1, two with IMP-1). In single TKS, all antibiotics alone demonstrated regrowth at 24 h, except amikacin against two strains and polymyxin B and meropenem against one strain each. In combination TKS, only polymyxin B plus tigecycline was bactericidal against all four XDR E. cloacae isolates at 24 h. In HFIM, tigecycline and polymyxin B alone did not exhibit any killing activity. Bactericidal kill was observed at 24 h for both isolates for polymyxin B plus tigecycline; killing was sustained for one isolate but regrowth was observed for the second. Phenotypically stable resistant mutants with reduced in vitro growth rates were observed. Polymyxin B plus tigecycline is a promising combination against XDR E. cloacae However, prolonged and indiscriminate use can result in resistance emergence.
