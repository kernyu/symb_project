Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health problem and control of the disease is hampered by the increasing emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR) strains. Novel drugs are urgently needed to overcome drug resistance. Among the most relevant targets of the past 3 years, herein we consider nine enzymes that have been studied in a target-based approach. These targets are involved mainly in the biosynthesis of the cell wall, alpha-glucan, coenzyme A and acyl carrier protein precursor, and in energy production, DNA metabolism, and pyrimidine synthesis. Some leads and many hits have been discovered using a target-based approach and can be further developed in a drug discovery process.
