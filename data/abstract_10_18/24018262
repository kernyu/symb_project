AAC(6')-Ib-cr is a plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance mechanism described worldwide for Escherichia coli. Since it confers in vitro only a low level of resistance to ciprofloxacin, we evaluated its impact on the in vivo activity of ciprofloxacin. Isogenic strains were obtained by transferring plasmid p449, harboring aac(6')-Ib-cr, into the quinolone-susceptible strain E. coli CFT073-RR and its D87G gyrA mutant. MICs were 0.015, 0.06, 0.25, and 0.5 mug/ml against E. coli strains CFT073-RR, CFT073-RR/p449, CFT073-RR GyrA(r), and CFT073-RR GyrA(r)/p449, respectively. Bactericidal activity was reduced at 1x the MIC for the three resistant derivatives, while at a fixed concentration of 0.5 mug/ml, 99.9% killing was observed for all strains except E. coli CFT073-RR GyrA(r)/p449. In the murine model of pyelonephritis, an optimal regimen of ciprofloxacin (10 mg/kg of body weight twice a day [b.i.d.]) significantly decreased the bacterial count in the kidneys of mice infected with E. coli CFT073 (1.6 versus 4.3 log10 CFU/g of kidney compared to untreated controls; P = 0.0001), while no significant decrease was observed for E. coli CFT073-RR/p449 (2.7 versus 3.1 log10 CFU/g; P = 0.84), E. coli CFT073-RR GyrA(r) (4.2 versus 4.1 log10 CFU/g; P = 0.35), or E. coli CFT073-RR GyrA(r)/p449 (2.9 versus 3.6 log10 CFU/g; P = 0.47). While pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) parameters accounted for ciprofloxacin failure against gyrA-containing mutants, this was not the case for the aac(6')-Ib-cr-containing strains, suggesting an in situ hydrolysis of ciprofloxacin in the latter case.
