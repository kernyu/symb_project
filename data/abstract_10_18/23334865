Exposure to substance toxicity is especially dangerous for diabetics because it accelerates and intensifies diabetic complication. Homeostasis of trace elements can be disrupted by diabetes mellitus. On the other hand, disturbance in trace element status in diabetes mellitus may contribute to insulin resistance and development of diabetic complications. The aim of the present study was to compare the concentration of elements in the brain, liver, and kidneys of animals with induced diabetes after the administration of plant preparations (iscador and vincristine) and 5-fluorouracil. The experiments were carried out on male mice. The animals were divided into five groups of ten mice each: one control and four experimental groups. The first experimental group was administered alloxan at 75 mg/kg b.w. for 4 days, the second group was administered both alloxan at 75 mg/kg b.w. and vincristine 1 mg/kg b.w. for 4 days, and the third group was administered both alloxan at 75 mg/kg b.w. and 5-fluorouracil 75 mg/kg b.w. for 4 days. The animals of the fourth group were administered both alloxan at 75 mg/kg b.w. and iscador Qu at 5 mg/kg b.w. for 4 days. Calcium, magnesium, iron, copper, zinc, sodium, and potassium levels in the tissues were analyzed by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer. We observed that zinc, copper, magnesium, sodium, and potassium were lower in the brain as compared to the control animals. The copper levels in the liver were also lower in diabetic groups than in control groups. However, the iscador and vincristine and 5-fluorouracil did not induce significant differences in the five groups. In conclusion, results of the current study indicated that changes of the investigated essential elements may contribute to explaining the role of impaired element metabolism of some elements in the progression of diabetic complications.
