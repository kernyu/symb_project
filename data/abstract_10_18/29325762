After the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of eravacycline as a novel fluorocycline was defined, understanding its pharmacodynamic (PD) profile became essential. The aim of this study was to assess the correlation of the PK/PD index of the area under free drug concentration-time curve above the minimum inhibitory concentration (fAUC/MIC) and its magnitude with eravacycline's efficacy against Enterobacteriaceae isolates using the immunocompetent murine thigh infection model to resemble the immunocompetent environment in eravacycline's clinical trials. Eight Enterobacteriaceae isolates with various resistance mechanisms were selected and tested. Eravacycline doses ranged 1-10 mg/kg/day and were given either once daily or divided into q12h doses over the 24h treatment period. Antibacterial efficacy was measured as the change in log10CFU at 24h compared with 0h controls. Composite data were modeled using a sigmoid Emax model. Eravacycline MICs ranged 0.125-0.5 microg/ml. The mean fAUC/MIC magnitudes required for stasis and 1-log reduction for the eight isolates were 2.9 +/- 3.1 and 5.6 +/- 5.0, respectively. While the humanized eravacycline regimen (2.5 mg/kg q12h) pharmacokinetically achieves a fAUC0-24 that is higher than the fAUC0-24 achieved with the 5 mg/kg q24h dose, the latter was associated with higher efficacy raising a suggestive correlation of the free peak drug concentration to the MIC (fCmax/MIC) index with eravacycline's efficacy. This study showed that the magnitudes associated with the efficacy of eravacycline in the immunocompetent murine thigh model appear to be close to achievable targets in human. These data support further development of eravacycline for the treatment of infections caused by drug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae.
