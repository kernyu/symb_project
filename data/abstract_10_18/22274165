The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro combination effects of aztreonam (AZT) and aminoglycosides against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains in Japan. We investigated 47 MDR P. aeruginosa strains collected from 8 facilities. We selected the aminoglycosides amikacin (AMK), gentamicin (GM), and arbekacin (ABK) to examine their effects when combined with AZT using the checkerboard method. Of the 47 MDR P. aeruginosa strains, 41 tested positive for metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL). In all combinations, aminoglycosides decreased the minimum inhibitory concentrations of AZT in a dose-dependent manner, and there was no apparent antagonism. The combination effects were scored on a scale of 0 to 4, and statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. In all 47 strains, AZT + ABK (mean score, 2.02) had the highest score, followed by AZT + AMK (1.68) and AZT + GM (1.38) (ABK versus GM, P < 0.0001). In 41 MBL-positive strains, AZT + ABK (mean score, 2.05) had the highest score, followed by AZT + AMK (1.56) and AZT + GM (1.37) (ABK versus AMK, P = 0.02, and ABK versus GM, P < 0.0001). AZT + ABK was the most promising combination regimen against MDR P. aeruginosa strains; the other promising combinations were AZT + AMK and AZT + GM.
