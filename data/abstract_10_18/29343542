The global spread of multi-drug resistant Gram negative has led to the return of colistin for treating severe infections. Recently, different plasmid-mediated genes conferring resistance to this drug were described and reported worldwide. International committees (EUCAST/CLSI) re-evaluated inconsistencies surrounding colistin antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), concluding that broth microdilution (BMD) should serve as the reference method for AST. The development of an accurate, reproducible commercial test based on BMD is therefore highly desirable. The SensiTest Colistin (STC), a BMD-based compact 4-test panel, containing the lyophilized antibiotic in 7 two-fold dilutions (0,25 - 16 mug/ml) was here compared with the EUCAST-CLSI standard reference method (BMD), and for some isolates, with the automated system Phoenix 100 (PHX). A total of 353 bacterial strains were evaluated by two different laboratories; 137 isolates were resistant to colistin (19 intrinsically, 83 harboring the mcr-1 gene). Essential agreement (EA) between STC and BMD was obtained for 339 out of the 353 strains tested (96,0%). The overall categorical agreement was obtained for 349 out of the 353 strains analyzed (98,9%). Two major errors (MEs, 0,93%) and two very major errors (VMEs, 1,46%) were documented. STC appeared as a simple but highly reliable test, with a good reproducibility even with panels stored at room temperature or at 35 degrees C. Moreover, STC showed a good performance on strains carrying the mcr-1 gene, with a 98,8% EA. As secondary endpoint of our study, VMEs for PHX were documented for 6 isolates (10%).
