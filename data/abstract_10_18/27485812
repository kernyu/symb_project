An important aspect related to infectious pathogens is their exceptional adaptability in developing resistance, which leads to a perpetual challenge in the discovery of antimicrobial drugs with novel mechanisms of action. Among them, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) stand out as promising anti-infective molecules. In order to overcome the high costs associated with isolation from natural sources or chemical synthesis of AMPs we propose the expression of Pa-MAP 2, a polyalanine AMP. Pa-MAP 2 was fused to an ELP-intein tag where the ELP (Elastin-like polypeptide) was used to promote aggregation and fast and cost-effective isolation after expression, and the intein was used to stimulate a controlled AMP release. For these, the vector pET21a was used to produce Pa-MAP 2 fused to the N-termini region of a modified Mxe GyrA intein followed by 60 repetitions of ELP. Purified Pa-MAP 2 showed a MIC of 25muM against E. coli ATCC 8739. Batch fermentation demonstrated that Pa-MAP-2 can be produced in both rich and defined media at yields 50-fold higher than reported for other AMPs produced by the ELP-intein system, and in comparable yields to expression systems with protease or chemical cleavage.
