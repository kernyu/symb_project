BACKGROUND: As antiretroviral therapy (ART) programs in sub-Saharan Africa mature, increasing numbers of persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection will experience treatment failure, and require second- or third-line ART. Data on second-line failure and development of protease inhibitor (PI) resistance in sub-Saharan Africa are scarce. METHODS: HIV-1-infected adults were included if they received >180 days of PI-based second-line ART. We assessed risk factors for having a detectable viral load (VL, >/=400 cps/mL) using Cox models. If VL was >/=1000 cps/mL, genotyping was performed. RESULTS: Of 227 included participants, 14.6%, 15.2% and 11.1% had VLs >/=400 cps/mL at 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively. Risk factors for a detectable VL were as follows: exposure to nonstandard nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based (hazard ratio, 7.10; 95% confidence interval, 3.40-14.83; P < .001) or PI-based (7.59; 3.02-19.07; P = .001) first-line regimen compared with zidovudine/lamivudine/NNRTI, PI resistance at switch (6.69; 2.49-17.98; P < .001), and suboptimal adherence (3.05; 1.71-5.42; P = .025). Among participants with VLs >/=1000 cps/mL, 22 of 32 (69%) harbored drug resistance mutation(s), and 7 of 32 (22%) harbored PI resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Although VL suppression rates were high, PI resistance was detected in 22% of participants with VLs >/=1000 cps/mL. To ensure long-term ART success, intensified support for adherence, VL and drug resistance testing, and third-line drugs will be necessary.
