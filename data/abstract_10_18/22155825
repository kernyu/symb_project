During a 2-year period in 2005 and 2006, 64 multidrug-resistant Providencia stuartii isolates, including 58 strains from 58 patients and 6 strains obtained from the same tracheal aspirator, were collected in a burn unit of a Tunisian hospital. They divided into four antibiotypes (ATB1 to ATB4) and three SmaI pulsotypes (PsA to PsC), including 49 strains belonging to clone PsA (48 of ATB1 and 1 of ATB4), 11 strains to clone PsB (7 of ATB2 and 4 of ATB3), and 4 strains to clone PsC (ATB3). All strains, except for the PsA/ATB4 isolate, were highly resistant to broad-spectrum cephalosporins due to the production of the plasmid-mediated CMY-16 beta-lactamase. In addition, the 15 strains of ATB2 and ATB3 exhibited decreased quinolone susceptibility associated with QnrA6. Most strains (ATB1 and ATB3) were gentamicin resistant, related to an AAC(6')-Ib' enzyme. All these genes were located on a conjugative plasmid belonging to the incompatibility group IncA/C(2) of 195, 175, or 100 kb. Despite differences in size and in number of resistance determinants, they derived from the same plasmid, as demonstrated by similar profiles in plasmid restriction analysis and strictly homologous sequences of repAIncA/C(2), unusual antibiotic resistance genes (e.g., aphA-6), and their genetic environments. Further investigation suggested that deletions, acquisition of the ISCR1 insertion sequence, and integron cassette mobility accounted for these variations. Thus, this outbreak was due to both the spread of three clonal strains and the dissemination of a single IncA/C(2) plasmid which underwent a remarkable evolution during the epidemic period.
