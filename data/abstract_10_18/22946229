The article presents the technique to evaluate the sensitivity of microorganisms-causative agents of infections isolated from patients, carriers and environment to the disinfectants. The proposed technique gives a possibility to detect the condition of microorganism resistance to disinfectant and to evaluate the degree of its sensitivity. The evaluation of sensitivity specificity accuracy, positive and negative prognostic value, reproducibility of developed technique was made.
