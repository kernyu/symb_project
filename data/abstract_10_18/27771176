PURPOSE: Case reports of treatment failure with standard-dose daptomycin (6 mg/kg) have recently surfaced in vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bloodstream infection (BSI) episodes with daptomycin MICs of 3 to 4 mg/L. The clinical implications of daptomycin MICs of 3 to 4 mg/L in VRE BSIs have not been elucidated. METHODS: We performed a single institutional retrospective analysis of adult stem cell transplant recipients and patients with hematologic malignancies diagnosed with VRE BSI from 2006 to 2014 and compared outcomes between those with daptomycin MICs of 3 to 4 mg/L those with 2 mg/L, as determined by Etest. FINDINGS: Forty-two daptomycin-treated VRE BSI episodes, all due to Enterococcus faecium were identified; 19 episodes with daptomycin MICs of 3 to 4 mg/L and 23 episodes with a daptomycin MIC of 2 mg/L. Patients in the higher daptomycin MIC group were more likely to be male, to be stem cell transplant recipients, and to have received high-dose daptomycin treatment (>6 mg/kg). In unadjusted analyses, microbiological failure in the daptomycin MICs 3 to 4 mg/L versus 2 mg/L groups (odds ratio = 1.79, 95% CI, 0.52-6.11; P = 0.35), the median duration of bacteremia (4 days in daptomycin MICs 3-4 mg/L vs 3 days in daptomycin MIC 2 mg/L; P = 0.18) and all-cause 30-day mortality (21% in daptomycin MICs 3-4 mg/L vs 35% in daptomycin MIC 2 mg/L group; P = 0.49) were not different. In adjusted analyses, the association between higher Pitt bacteremia scores and all-cause 30-day mortality was statistically significant (P = 0.0006), whereas the association between daptomycin MICs of 3 to 4 mg/L and all-cause 30-day mortality approached statistical significance (P = 0.06). IMPLICATIONS: Duration of bacteremia and microbiological failure rates did not differ by daptomycin MICs in VRE BSI episodes in our patients, composed of adult stem cell transplant recipients and patients with hematologic malignancies. There was a nonsignificant trend in multivariable analysis suggesting that all-cause 30-day mortality was lower in patients whose VRE bloodstream isolates were with daptomycin MICs of 3 to 4 mg/L.
