OBJECTIVE: The burden of candidemia is shifting from intensive care units (ICU) to non-ICU settings. This study aimed to define the differences in epidemiology and predictors of death between ICU-acquired candidemia (ICUAC) and non-ICUAC. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 80 patients with ICUAC and 147 patients with non-IUCAC at five hospitals. RESULTS: The distribution of Candida species and resistance to antifungal agents did not differ between the ICUAC and non-ICUAC groups. ICUAC patients received more echinocandins and less triazoles, as well as more adequate antifungal therapy than non-ICUAC patients (all p<0.05). ICUAC patients had a significantly higher average acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score (21.0+/-7.9 vs. 17.8+/-8.6; p<0.01), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (9.2+/-5.5 vs. 7.4+/-3.9; p<0.05) and day-90 mortality rate (52.5% vs. 36.7%; p<0.05) when compared to non-ICUAC patients. Using a multivariate logistic analysis, adequate antifungal therapy was found to be the only protective factor for death in both groups. Respiratory failure supported with invasive mechanical ventilation, renal failure supported with replacement therapy and an APACHE II score >/=20 were independent predictors of death in ICUAC patients, while age >/=60 years, concurrent bacteremia and APACHE II score >/=20 were independent predictors of death in non-ICUAC patients. CONCLUSION: The Candida species and antifungal resistance profiles in patients with ICUAC were similar to non-ICUAC patients, but led to worse outcomes. The protective and risk factors for death may therefore be relevant for the clinical management of patients with candidemia in ICU and non-ICU settings.
