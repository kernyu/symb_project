We evaluated the in vitro and in vivo activities of the investigational arylamidine T-2307 against echinocandin-resistant Candida albicans. T-2307 demonstrated potent in vitro activity, and daily subcutaneous doses between 0.75 and 6 mg/kg of body weight significantly improved survival and reduced fungal burden compared to placebo control and caspofungin (10 mg/kg/day) in mice with invasive candidiasis caused by an echinocandin-resistant strain. Thus, T-2307 may have potential use in the treatment of echinocandin-resistant C. albicans infections.
