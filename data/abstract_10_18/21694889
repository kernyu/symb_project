Antimicrobial resistance is a global concern. Over the past few years, considerable efforts and resources have been expended to detect, monitor, and understand at the basic level the many different facets of emerging and increasing resistance. Development of new antimicrobial agents has been matched by the development of new mechanisms of resistance by bacteria. Current antibiotics act at a variety of sites within the target bacteria, including the cross-linking enzymes in the cell wall, various ribosomal enzymes, nucleic acid polymerases, and folate synthesis. Ceftobiprole is a novel parenteral cephalosporin with high affinity for most penicillin-binding proteins, including the mecA product penicillin-binding protein 2a, rendering it active against methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Its in vitro activity against staphylococci and multiresistant pneumococci, combined with its Gram-negative spectrum comparable to that of other extended-spectrum cephalosporins, its stability against a wide range of beta-lactamases, and its pharmacokinetic and safety profiles make ceftobiprole an attractive and well tolerated new antimicrobial agent. The US Food and Drug Administration granted ceftobiprole medocaril fast-track status in 2003 for the treatment of complicated skin infections and skin structure infections due to methicillin-resistant staphylococci, and subsequently extended this to treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia due to suspected or proven methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
