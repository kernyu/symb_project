The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence, antimicrobial susceptibility and resistant determinants of Elizabethkingia meningoseptica in a Beijing hospital. Four hundred and eighty-seven samples from medical devices, hospital surfaces and medical staff hands were collected. In total, 26 E. meningoseptica isolates were obtained. The sinks, faucets, and drains accounted for more than half of the total number of isolates recovered. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that 24 isolates were resistant to one or more antibiotics. All strains were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin. Although the trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole has previously been shown to exhibit good activity against E. meningoseptica, in our study 15 strains were resistant to it. We detected trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole resistance determinants using PCR; six isolates possessed the sulI gene and four possessed the sulII gene, whilst the dfrA12 gene was detected in only one of them. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis showed 9 distinct types and one dominant pattern with 12 strains was found. Our data indicate that antimicrobial resistant E. meningoseptica strains exist in the hospital environment and susceptibility testing revealed that vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam was the most effective antibiotics. These results have practical significance for treatment of E. meningoseptica infection.
