In the context of the dangerous phenomenon of fungal resistance to the available therapies, we present here the chemical synthesis of a new series of thiazolyl-triazole Schiff bases B1-B15, which were in vitro assessed for their anti-Candida potential. Compound B10 was found to be more potent against Candida spp. when compared with the reference drugs Fluconazole and Ketoconazole. A docking study of the newly synthesized Schiff bases was performed, and results showed good binding affinity in the active site of co-crystallized Itraconazole-lanosterol 14alpha-demethylase isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. An in silico ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity) study was done in order to predict some pharmacokinetic and pharmacotoxicological properties. The Schiff bases showed good drug-like properties. The results of in vitro anti-Candida activity, a docking study and ADMET prediction revealed that the newly synthesized compounds have potential anti-Candida activity and evidenced the most active derivative, B10, which can be further optimized as a lead compound.
