Blockade of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a promising area in breast cancer therapy. However, in clinical trials, objective response rate with mTOR inhibitor monotherapy in breast cancer was modest. Biomarker studies designed to identify the responders of rapalogs are of increasing interest. We validated p27KIP1 expression levels as a candidate predictive biomarker of response to rapalogs. We also analyzed the correlation between rapamycin activity and p27KIP1 expression in the primary breast cancer cells and the patient-derived breast tumor xenograft models. The cells isolated from the breast tumor tissues expressing high levels of p27KIP1 were sensitive to rapamycin, whereas the cells from the tissues expressing low levels of p27KIP1 exhibited resistance to rapamycin. The correlation between p27KIP1 expression and rapamycin antitumor activity was also observed in the patient-derived breast tumor xenograft models. Moreover, we also found rapamycin significantly decreased phosphorylated p70S6K1 and phosphorylated 4EBP1 in both samples. It seemed that the different sensitivity of tumor cells to rapamycin did not owe to its different potency against mTOR activity. We further propose p27KIP1 expression level may be also a candidate predictive biomarker of rapalogs for breast cancer therapy, which requires additional clinical validation.
