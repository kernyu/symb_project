Tm-1, an inhibitor protein of Tomato mosaic virus RNA replication, contains two conserved domains: an uncharacterized domain at its N-terminus and a TIM-barrel-like domain at its C-terminus. The N-terminal domain of Tm-1 has an inhibitory activity and its three-dimensional structure has not been determined. Here, the crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction of the N-terminal domain of Tm-1 are reported. A three-wavelength MAD data set was collected from a selenomethionine-labelled crystal and processed to 2.7 A resolution. The crystal belonged to the triclinic space group P1, with unit-cell parameters a = 77.97, b = 105.28, c = 110.62 A, alpha = 94.6, beta = 109.3, gamma = 108.0 degrees .
