BACKGROUND: Clarithromycin resistance has decreased the eradication rates of Helicobacter pylori. AIMS: To determine whether a 10-day course of sequential therapy (ST) is more effective at eradicating H pylori infection than triple therapy (TT) in the first or second line, and to assess side effects and compliance with therapy. METHODS: One hundred sixty treatment-naive and 40 non-treatment-naive patients who were positive for H pylori infection by (1)(3)C-urea breath test or endoscopy were enrolled. Eighty of 160 patients underwent TT, while 80 of 160 underwent ST with omeprazole (20 mg) plus amoxicillin (1 g) twiceday for five days, followed by omeprazole (20 mg) with tinidazole (500 mg) twiceday and clarithromycin (500 mg) twiceday for five consecutive days. H pylori eradication was evaluated by (1)(3)C-urea breath test no sooner than four weeks after the end of treatment. RESULTS: Eradication was achieved in 59 of 80 treatment-naive patients treated with TT (74%), in 74 of 80 patients treated with ST (93%), and in 38 of 40 non-treatment-naive patients (95%). Eradication rates in treatment-naive patients with ST were statistically significantly higher than TT (92.5% versus 73.7%; P=0.0015; OR 4.39 [95% CI 1.66 to 11.58]). Mild adverse effects were reported for both regimens. CONCLUSIONS: ST appears to be a well-tolerated, promising therapy; however, randomized controlled trials with larger and more diverse sample populations are needed before it can be recommended as a first-line treatment.
