Imipenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (IRKP) were used to explore the synergistic anti-bacterial and proteomic effects of imipenem alone or in combination with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg). The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of EGCG for 12 clinically isolated IRKP strains ranged from 300 to 650 mug/ml. Each of the 12 IRKP strains experienced a 4- to 64-fold reduction in the MIC of imipenem upon co-incubation with 0.25 x MIC level of EGCg. The time-kill method was used on the 12 IRKP clinical isolates to evaluate the bactericidal activities of imipenem alone or with EGCg. Compared to imipenem alone, EGCg with imipenem demonstrated enhanced bactericidal activity. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis identified eight down-regulated and four up-regulated proteins in the IRKP strain upon exposure to 1 x MIC of EGCg. Analysis of the outer membrane protein profiles of IRKP cultures treated with EGCg revealed unique changes in outer membrane proteins. In addition, scanning electron microscopic analysis demonstrated the presence of cells with wrinkled surfaces containing perforations and irregular rod-shaped forms after treatment with EGCg or imipenem. These studies demonstrate that EGCg can synergize the bacterial activity of imipenem and differentially stimulate the expression of various proteins in IRKP.
