Upon exposure to 8% ethanol, survival and growth of yeast strains deficient in histone deacetylase complex genes was examined. Of the 18 mutants tested, the Deltasir3 and Deltasir4 strains showed higher resistance to ethanol, while the Deltarco1, Deltahos3, Deltahda2, and Deltahst1 strains were more sensitive than the wild type. Furthermore, these ethanol-resistant patterns varied under aerobic and anaerobic culture conditions.
