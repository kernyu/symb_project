Kill kinetics and MICs of finafloxacin and ciprofloxacin against 34 strains with defined resistance mechanisms grown in cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth (CAMHB) at pH values of 7.2 and 5.8 and in synthetic urine at pH 5.8 were determined. In general, finafloxacin gained activity at low pH values in CAMHB and remained almost unchanged in artificial urine. Ciprofloxacin MICs increased and bactericidal activity decreased strain dependently in acidic CAMHB and particularly in artificial urine.
