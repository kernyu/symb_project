BACKGROUND: Among patients admitted to European hospitals or intensive care units (ICUs), 5.7% and 19.5% will encounter healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), respectively, and antimicrobial resistance is emerging. As hospital surfaces are contaminated with potentially pathogenic bacteria, environmental cleanliness is an essential aspect to reduce HAIs. AIM: To address the efficacy of a titanium dioxide coating in reducing the microbial colonization of environmental surfaces in an ICU. METHODS: A prospective, controlled, single-centre pilot study was conducted to examine the effect of a titanium dioxide coating on the microbial colonization of surfaces in an ICU. During the pre- and post-intervention periods, surfaces were cultured with agar contact plates (BBL RODAC plates). Factors that were potentially influencing the bacterial colonization of surfaces were recorded. A repeated measurements analysis within a hierarchic multi-level framework was used to analyse the effect of the intervention, controlling for the explanatory variables. FINDINGS: The mean ratio for the total number of colony-forming units (cfus) in a room between the pre- and post-intervention periods was 0.86 (standard deviation 0.57). The optimal model included the following explanatory variables: intervention (P=0.065), week (P=0.002), culture surfaces (P<0.001), ICU room (P=0.039), and interaction between intervention and week (P=0.002) and between week and culture surfaces (P=0.031). The effect of the intervention on the number of cfus from all culture plates in Week 4 between the pre- and post-intervention periods was -0.47 (95% confidence interval -0.24 to - 0.70). CONCLUSION: This study found that a titanium dioxide coating had no effect on the microbial colonization of surfaces in an ICU.
