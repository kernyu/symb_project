The store-operated calcium channels (SOCs) represent one of the major calcium-entry pathways in non-excitable cells. SOCs and in particular their major components ORAI1 and STIM1 have been shown to be implicated in a number of physiological and pathological processes such as apoptosis, proliferation and invasion. Here we demonstrate that ORAI1 and STIM1 mediate store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines. We show that both ORAI1 and STIM1 play pro-survival anti-apoptotic role in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines, as siRNA-mediated knockdown of ORAI1 and/or STIM1 increases apoptosis induced by chemotherapy drugs 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or gemcitabine. We also demonstrate that both 5-FU and gemcitabine treatments increase SOCE in Panc1 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line via upregulation of ORAI1 and STIM1. Altogether our results reveal the novel calcium-dependent mechanism of action of the chemotherapy drugs 5-FU and gemcitabine and emphasize the anti-apoptotic role of ORAI1 and STIM1 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells.
