OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the possible occupational hazard of environmental strains of opportunistic Pseudomonas aeruginosa on hydrocarbon contaminated sites during remediation, 2 multidrug-resistant isolates originating from environmental (soil and groundwater) samples were examined. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Antibiotic resistance profiles of the examined 2 strains were determined by Etest(R) against 20 different agents. Virulence investigations included the hemolytic activity test, the detection of virulence-related gene sequences such as exoA, exoU, exoS, exoY, exoT and the determination of intraperitoneal LD50 (the lethal dose, 50%) values in a mouse model. The hydrocarbon-degrading ability was evaluated in a gravimetric experiment, in vitro. The phylogenetic relationship of the isolates was investigated with a multilocus sequence typing scheme. RESULTS: Multidrug resistant environmental strains of P. aeruginosa are strongly related to isolates that have proven effects on the infection of patients who suffer from cystic fibrosis, have a notable hemolytic activity, carry important virulence markers (exoS or exoU, respectively) and retain their hydrocarbon degradation ability (87.4% and 62.8% hydrocarbon degradation rate, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa presumably raise considerable concerns for human health in the environment, already well known among nosocomial isolates, and the application of environmental strains of this species for environmental purposes is questionable.
