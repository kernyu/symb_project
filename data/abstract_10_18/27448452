Among 323 specimens from male patients with symptoms of non-gonococcal urethritis, Mycoplasma genitalium was detected in 19 samples by real-time PCR. Mutations of 23S rRNA gene associated with macrolide resistance were confirmed in 10 strains. Amino acid changes at positions 81 and 83 of ParC protein were demonstrated indicating quinolone resistance of two strains.
