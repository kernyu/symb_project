BACKGROUND: The use of peri-operative antimicrobial prophylaxis during urological procedures to prevent postoperative complications is very common. OBJECTIVES: What kind of recommendations for reasonable use of peri-operative antimicrobial prophylaxis during urological procedures to prevent increasing antibiotic resistance and postoperative complications exist? METHODS: Review of evidence-based recommendations from literature and current Guidelines of the EAU. RESULTS: For urological procedures there are evidenced-based recommendations for using antimicrobial prophylaxis, although the evidence is not always sufficiently high. For endourological procedures it is recommended to use Cephalosporines group 2 (or 3), Aminopenicillin/Beta-lactamase inhibitor or Cotrimoxazole. For transrectal core biopsy of the prostate, depending on the risk, Fluoroquinolones, Cotrimoxazole or targeted prophylaxis are recommended. For laparoscopic or open procedures, partly optional, Cephalosporines group 2 (or 3), Aminopenicillin/Beta-lactamase inhibitor or Cotrimoxazole and for a cystectomy with opening of the intestinal tract Cephalosporines group 2 or an Aminopenicillin/Beta-lactamase inhibitor, together with Metronidazole are recommended. CONCLUSIONS: Using prudent peri-operative antimicrobial prophylaxis patient surgical risk factors as well as the expected spectrum of pathogens and the local resistance profile should be considered. Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis on the one hand aims at preventing postoperative infections, and on the other hand plays an important role in the total antibiotic consumption. It is therefore a pivotal aspect of "Antimicrobial Stewardship" strategies in the health-care system.
