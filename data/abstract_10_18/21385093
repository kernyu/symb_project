CONTEXT: The diseases of plants and humans due to pathogenic fungi are increasing. Among the substances used to combat fungi, the azoles are of primary interest, both in agricultural field both in health. To avoid fungal resistance phenomena, the synthesis and tests of new derivatives are necessary. OBJECTIVE: This article discusses the synthesis and the antifungal activity of pyrazolo[3,4-c]isothiazole and isothiazolo[4,3-d]isoxazole derivatives against three fungi that are pathogenic only for plants and two fungi that are opportunistic in humans and plants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The compounds were prepared starting from 2-cyano-3-ethoxy-2-butenethioamide. The antifungal activity of the compounds was determined by measuring the inhibition of growth of the fungi tested at 20, 50, and 100 microg/mL in comparison with the controls. RESULTS: Results demonstrated that several compounds were able to control the mycelial growth of the tested fungi, even if they showed different sensitivity to the different azole-derivatives. In general Magnaporthe grisea (T.T. Hebert) Yaegashi & Udagawa was the most sensitive fungus, being blocked almost entirely by 4-chloro derivative even at 20 microg/mL, a concentration at which the reference commercial compound tricyclazole was nearly ineffective. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that the pyrazolo[3,4-c]isothiazole derivatives have a wide spectrum of activity on phytopathogenic and opportunistic fungi. In particular the 4-chloro derivative seems to have a great potential as new product to combat M. grisea in the agricultural field.
