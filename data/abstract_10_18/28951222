The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of dietary pyridoxine (PN) deficiency on growth performance, intestinal immune function and the potential regulation mechanisms in young grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). Fish were fed six diets containing graded levels of PN (0.12-7.48 mg/kg) for 70 days. After that, a challenge test was conducted by infection of Aeromonas hydrophila for 14 days. The results showed that compared with the optimal PN level, PN deficiency: (1) reduced the production of innate immune components such as lysozyme (LZ), acid phosphatase (ACP), complements and antimicrobial peptides and adaptive immune components such as immunoglobulins in three intestinal segments of young grass carp (P < 0.05); (2) down-regulated the mRNA levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), interleukin 4/13A (IL-4/13A) (rather than IL-4/13B), IL-10 and IL-11 partly relating to target of rapamycin (TOR) signalling [TOR/ribosomal protein S6 kinases 1 (S6K1) and eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BP)] in three intestinal segments of young grass carp; (3) up-regulated the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) [not in the proximal intestine (PI) and distal intestine (DI)], IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12p35, IL-12p40, IL-15 and IL-17D [(rather than interferon gamma2 (IFN-gamma2)] partly relating to nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) signalling [IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta) and IKKgamma/inhibitor of kappaBalpha (IkappaBalpha)/NF-kappaB (p65 and c-Rel)] in three intestinal segments of young grass carp. These results suggest that PN deficiency could impair the intestinal immune function, and the potential regulation mechanisms were partly associated with TOR and NF-kappaB signalling pathways. In addition, based on percent weight gain (PWG), the ability against enteritis and LZ activity, the dietary PN requirements for young grass carp were estimated to be 4.43, 4.75 and 5.07 mg/kg diet, respectively.
