Viruses may remain infectious outside the host cell for considerable time and represent a source of accidental infection if not properly inactivated. In this study, the survival of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in suspension and dried on surfaces was analyzed. In addition, the sensitivity of VSV to disinfectants and physicochemical changes was investigated. VSV showed a notable stability in suspension at 4 degrees C with virus titers remaining high over several weeks. The presence of serum proteins had a stabilizing effect on virus infectivity, whereas elevated temperatures reduced survival times. VSV dried on polystyrene, glass or stainless steel surfaces remained infectious for at least 6 days at ambient temperature. VSV showed a remarkable resistance to extreme pH in particular in the alkaline range, but could be rapidly inactivated by heating at 55 degrees C or higher. The virus was highly sensitive to inactivation by commonly used disinfectants such as aldehydes, alcohols, and detergents. The high stability of VSV on surfaces and in suspension may facilitate dissemination of the virus in livestock by contaminated feeding and water troughs, hands, and milking equipment. This knowledge on the sensitivity of VSV to disinfectants will help to set up appropriate hygiene measures.
