UNLABELLED: The goal of first-line Helicobacter pylori therapy is to reach an eradication rate of 90% to avoid further investigations, antibiotic use, and spreading of resistant strains. AIM: To evaluate the eradication rate of high-dose sequential therapy in treatment-naive children and to assess factors associated with failure. METHODS: Prospective data assessed in a registry from nine European centers between October 2009 and December 2011. Children with biopsy-proven Helicobacter pylori infection were prescribed 5 days of esomeprazole and amoxicillin, followed by 5 days of esomeprazole, clarithromycin, and metronidazole according to bodyweight. Eradication was assessed after 8-12 weeks. Primary endpoint was the eradication rate in children who received at least one dose and had follow-up data. Multivariate analysis evaluated potential factors for treatment success including sex, age, center, migrant status, antibiotic resistance, and adherence to therapy. RESULTS: Follow-up was available in 209 of 232 patients (age range 3.1-17.9 years, 118 females). Primary resistance occurred for clarithromycin in 30 of 209 (14.4%), for metronidazole in 32 (15.3%), for both antibiotics in 7 (3.3%), and culture failed in 6 (2.9%). Eradication was achieved in 168 of 209 children (80.4%, 95% CI 75.02-85.78), in 85.8% with no resistance, 72.6% with single resistance, and 28.6% with double resistance. Independent factors affecting eradication rate included resistance to clarithromycin (adjusted ORs 0.27 (0.09-0.84), p = .024), to metronidazole (0.25 (0.009-0.72), p = .010) or to both (0.04 (0.01-0.35), p = .004), and intake of </= 90% of prescribed drugs (0.03 (0.01-0.18), p < .001). CONCLUSION: A high-dose 10-day sequential therapy cannot be recommended in treatment-naive children.
