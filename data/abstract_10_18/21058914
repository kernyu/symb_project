We conducted a 10-year retrospective evaluation of the epidemiology and identification of Nocardia isolates submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The species most commonly identified were N. nova (28%), N. brasiliensis (14%), and N. farcinica (14%). Of 765 isolates submitted, 61% were resistant to sulfamethoxazole and 42% were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
