We describe the prevalence of and risk factors for colonization with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species (ESBL-EK) in hospitalized patients. The prevalence of colonization with ESBL-EK was 2.6%. Colonization was associated with cirrhosis, longer duration of hospital stay prior to surveillance, and prior exposure to clindamycin or meropenem.
