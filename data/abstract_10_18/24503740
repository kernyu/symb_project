Bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics poses a serious threat to human health. Penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) and beta-lactamases are involved in both antibacterial activity and mediation of beta-lactam antibiotic resistance. The two major reasons for resistance to beta-lactams include: (i) pathogenic bacteria expressing drug insensitive PBPs rendering beta-lactam antibiotics ineffective and (ii) production of beta-lactamases along with alteration of their specificities. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop newer beta-lactams to overcome the challenge of bacterial resistance. Therefore the present study aims to identify the binding affinity of beta-lactam antibiotics with different types of PBPs and beta-lactamases. In this study, cephalosporins and carbapenems are docked into PBP2a of Staphylococcus aureus, PBP2b and PBP2x of Streptococcus pneumoniae and SHV-1 beta-lactamase of Escherichia coli. The results reveal that Ceftobiprole can efficiently bind to PBP2a, PBP2b and PBP2x and not strongly to SHV-1 beta-lactamase. Furthermore, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed to refine the binding mode of the docked complex structure and to observe the differences in the stability of free PBP2x and Ceftobiprole bound PBP2x. MD simulation supports the greater stability of the Ceftobiprole-PBP2x complex compared to free PBP2x. This work demonstrates that potential beta-lactam antibiotics can efficiently bind to different types of PBPs for circumventing beta-lactam resistance and opens avenues for the development of newer antibiotics that can target bacterial pathogens.
