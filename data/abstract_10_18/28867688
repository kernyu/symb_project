Twenty-three isolates of Pasteurella multocida were tested for susceptibility to six aminoglycoside agents and screened by polymerase chain reaction for the presence of aminoglycoside resistance genes. In addition, mutations in the resistance-determining region of strains showing a high level of induced resistance to spectinomycin strains were examined. Susceptibility testing showed that all of the isolates were resistant to at least two types of aminoglycosides, and that the most effective antimicrobial was spectinomycin. The resistance genes aphA1, strB and aacA4 were present in all 23 isolates. In the three induced spectinomycin-resistant strains, a 9-bp deletion in rpsE that encodes ribosomal protein S5 was detected.
