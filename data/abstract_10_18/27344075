OBJECTIVE: This is a review article aiming to bring the place and manner of use of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid in urology. METHOD: Data collection on the conditions of use of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid in urology has been performed from the Medline database. The following keywords were used: amoxicillin; clavulanic acid; urine; diffusion; pharmacokinetics. The selection was based on the methodology, language of publication (English/French), relevance to the topic and date of publication of the articles collected. RESULTS: Overall, it is clear from the literature and the national and international guidelines that amoxicillin-clavulanic acid in urinary infections can not be used in probabilistic. However, this association remains valid excepted in the treatment of male urinary tract infections due to a probable fault prostatic diffusion. Note that changing the critical concentrations by the CA-SFM/EUCAST for cystitis of this association should allow an extension of its indication in this situation. Serious adverse effects of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid remain rare. CONCLUSION: If long, the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid played a role of first order in the field of urology, the association has given way to other molecules because of the emergence of resistance. However, A-AC keeps indications in the field of antibiotic therapy in urinary tract infections, surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis and postoperative infections in urology.
