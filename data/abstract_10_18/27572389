A collection of azole-susceptible (n = 141) and azole-resistant (n = 27) Aspergillus fumigatus isolates was tested against seven antifungal drugs, including the new imidazoles lanoconazole and luliconazole. The luliconazole and lanoconazole MIC90 values for the azole-susceptible strains were 0.001 mug/ml and 0.008 mug/ml, and those for the azole-resistant strains were 0.016 mug/ml and 0.032 mug/ml.
