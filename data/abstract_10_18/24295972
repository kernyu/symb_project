We determined the presence of extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli among 3,344 study participants from the German community. Intestinal colonization was detected in 211 persons (6.3%), without significant differences among the different age groups. The majority (95.2%) of isolates harbored CTX-M-type ESBL, with CTX-M-15 (46%) and CTX-M-1 (24.2%) as the most common types. The finding of ESBL producers and one isolate additionally producing carbapenemase OXA-244 indicates a risk of dissemination of resistant bacteria outside the hospitals.
