Infections produced by carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) are increasing worldwide. Therapeutic options are scarce because many of these bacteria are resistant to other antimicrobial groups. Furthermore, the dissemination of some carbapenemases and CPE is occurring rapidly. Health care authorities should be aware of the relevance of this problem, and coordinated surveillance and control strategies at all levels of the health system should be undertaken. The Spanish Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (SEIMC) and The Spanish Network for Research on Infectious Diseases (REIPI, Institute of Health Carlos III, Ministry of Health, Spain) has selected a panel of Spanish experts on infections caused by CPE from the areas of clinical microbiology, infectious diseases and public health to review and discuss the most controversial issues regarding this increasing threat.
