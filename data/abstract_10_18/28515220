Azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus is an increasing worldwide problem with major clinical implications. Surveillance is warranted to guide clinicians to provide optimal treatment to patients. To investigate azole resistance in clinical Aspergillus isolates in our institution, a Belgian university hospital, we conducted a laboratory-based surveillance between June 2015 and October 2016. Two different approaches were used: a prospective culture-based surveillance using VIPcheck on unselected A. fumigatus (n = 109 patients, including 19 patients with proven or probable invasive aspergillosis [IA]), followed by molecular detection of mutations conferring azole resistance, and a retrospective detection of azole-resistant A. fumigatus in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid using the commercially available AsperGenius PCR (n = 100 patients, including 29 patients with proven or probable IA). By VIPcheck, 25 azole-resistant A. fumigatus specimens were isolated from 14 patients (12.8%). Of these 14 patients, only 2 had proven or probable IA (10.5%). Mutations at the cyp51A gene were observed in 23 of the 25 A. fumigatus isolates; TR34/L98H was the most prevalent mutation (46.7%), followed by TR46/Y121F/T289A (26.7%). Twenty-seven (27%) patients were positive for the presence of Aspergillus species by AsperGenius PCR. A. fumigatus was detected by AsperGenius in 20 patients, and 3 of these patients carried cyp51A mutations. Two patients had proven or probable IA and cyp51A mutation (11.7%). Our study has shown that the detection of azole-resistant A. fumigatus in clinical isolates was a frequent finding in our institution. Hence, a rapid method for resistance detection may be useful to improve patient management. Centers that care for immunocompromised patients should perform routine surveillance to determine their local epidemiology.
