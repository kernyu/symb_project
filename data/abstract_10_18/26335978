MDR3 dysfunction is associated with liver diseases. We report here a novel MDR3 activity assay involving in situ biosynthesis in primary hepatocytes of deuterium (d9)-labeled PC and LC-MS/MS determination of transported extracellular PC-d9. Several drugs associated with DILI such as chlorpromazine, imipramine, itraconazole, haloperidol, ketoconazole, sequinavir, clotrimazole, ritonavir, and troglitazone inhibit MDR3 activity. MDR3 inhibition may play an important role in drug-induced cholestasis and vanishing bile duct syndrome. Several lines of evidence demonstrate that the reported assay is physiologically relevant and can be used to assess the potential of chemical entities and their metabolites to modulate MDR3 activity and/or PC biosynthesis in hepatocytes.
