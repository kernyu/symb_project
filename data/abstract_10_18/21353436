Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Acinetobacter baumannii infections caused 91% (10/11) mortality in transplant recipients. Isolates were colistin-susceptible initially, but susceptibility decreased during therapy in 40% (4/10). We tested antibiotic combinations against XDR Acinetobacter in vitro and demonstrated positive interactions for carbapenem-colistin. Subsequently, 80% (4/5) of transplant patients were treated successfully with carbepenem-colistin regimens.
