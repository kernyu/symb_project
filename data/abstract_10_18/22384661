Since early May 2011 a large food-borne outbreak caused by E. coli O104:H4 affected Germany then spread over 13 European countries, U.S.A. and Canada. The outbreak strain was found to possess an unusual combination of enteroaggregative E. coli pathotype with StxII. In this report we described the molecular investigation of epidemic clone in Poland during the international outbreak. We confirmed three cases of E. coli O104:H4 infections. The molecular characteristics of the Polish E. coli O104:H4 isolates including virulence profile, antimicrobial resistance, PFGE and plasmids profiles were corresponded with Germany outbreak strains.
