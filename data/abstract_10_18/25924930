Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide, especially in Western societies. Its aggressive nature and poor prognosis increase the need for identifying new and more accurate diagnostic and prognostic tools. We studied 41 patients who had undergone radical surgical resection for PC, investigated B7H4 protein expression in the PC tissue specimens of these patients by immunohistochemistry and analyzed several clinical and pathological features. The positive expression of the B7H4 antigen was associated with a negative impact of chemotherapy with gemcitabine on patient survival and also correlated with high CA19.9 serum levels and poorly differentiated tumors. Moreover, patients that overexpressed B7H4 antigen had worse prognosis compared to the ones that did not overexpress B7H4. B7H4 antigen is a negative prognostic marker for PC patients and also seems to express resistance of PC patients to chemotherapy with gemcitabine.
