Pharmacodynamics of a polymyxin B, meropenem, and rifampin triple combination were examined against Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) ST258. In time-kill experiments against three KPC-Kp isolates, triple combination generated 8.14, 8.19, and 8.29 log10 CFU/ml reductions within 24 h. In the hollow-fiber infection model, the triple combination caused maximal killing of 5.16 log10 CFU/ml at 78 h and the time required for regrowth was more than doubled versus the 2-drug combinations. Remarkably, combinations with a high single-dose polymyxin B burst plus rifampin preserved KPC-Kp polymyxin susceptibility (MIC240 h = 0.5 mg/liter) versus the same combination with traditionally dosed polymyxin B, where resistance was amplified (MIC240 h = 32 mg/liter).
