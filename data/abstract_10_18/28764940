OBJECTIVES: Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Enterobacter aerogenes strains are frequently associated with nosocomial infections and high mortality rates, representing a serious public health problem. The aim of this study was to present the draft genome sequence of a MDR KPC-2-producing E. aerogenes isolated from a perineal swab of a hospitalised patient in Brazil. METHODS: Genomic DNA was sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq platform. De novo genome assembly was carried out using the A5-Miseq pipeline, and whole-genome sequence analysis was performed using tools from the Center for Genomic Epidemiology. RESULTS: The strain harboured resistance genes to beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, sulphonamides and trimethoprim in addition to genes encoding multidrug efflux system proteins, a quaternary ammonium transporter and heavy metal efflux system proteins. In addition, the strain harboured genes encoding diverse virulence factors. CONCLUSION: These data might allow a better understanding of the genetic basis of antimicrobial resistance and virulence in E. aerogenes strains.
