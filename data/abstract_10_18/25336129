UNLABELLED: The evolution of multidrug resistance remains an alarming topic due to selection pressure related to the inappropriate use of antibiotics. OBJECTIVES: Our work is in this perspective and focuses on the evolution of the consumption of antibiotics active on gram-negative bacilli, and the evolution of bacterial resistance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: International indicator of antibiotic consumption was based on the method of Defined Daily Dose reported to the number of days of hospitalization. The search for a correlation between bacterial resistance and antibiotic consumption was conducted by the Spearman test. RESULTS: A statistically significant correlation was identified between the rates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to 3(rd) generation cephalosporin, particularly those secreting beta-lactamases with extended spectrum, and consumption of 3(rd) generation cephalosporin (p= 0.002) and imipenem (p= 0.04). Also, a statistically significant relationship between the multi-resistant bacteria and the rate of consumption of colistin (p= 0.041) and fluoroquinolones (p= 0.002) was also reported in this study. CONCLUSION: Monitoring of both evolution of multidrug resistance and the use of antibiotics helps us to better understand the situation and establish more efficient antibiotic protocols.
