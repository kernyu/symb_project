A series of eighteen new 1-(4-substituted benzylidene)-4-(1-(substituted methyl)-2,3-dioxoindolin-5-yl)semicarbazide derivatives were designed, synthesized and characterized by spectral and elemental analyses. The derivatives were screened in vitro for antimicrobial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (ATCC 27294) and MDR-TB strains. The activity was expressed as the minimum inhibitory concentration in mug/mL. Among the tested compounds 7j, 7m, 7o and 7q possesses equipotent activity as standard drug Isoniazid against MTB while 7m and 7q exhibited higher activity against MDR-TB strain when compared with both the reference drugs isoniazid and rifampicin. Basic structure activity relationships are presented.
