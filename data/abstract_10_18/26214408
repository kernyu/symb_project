Mikania glomerata (Spreng.), popularly known as "guaco", is a plant from the Asteraceae family that has many therapeutic properties. The use of medicinal plants has been examined in studies on endophytic diversity and bioprospecting; endophytes inhabit the interior of plants without harming them. Microorganism-host complex interactions are related to the production of compounds that may confer resistance to pathogens or to production of bioactive compounds or growth regulators. In this study, we evaluated foliar endophytic fungi of M. glomerata to examine the control of plant pathogens, molecular identification, and production of compounds with antimicrobial activity. In the antagonism test, 6-mm diameter disks were placed equidistant from the endophyte and plant pathogen, and pathogen growth area was measured. The endophytic strains G-01, G-02, and G-03 were effective against Fusarium solani and Didymella bryoniae. The endophyte rDNA regions corresponding to internal transcribed spacer 1-5.8S-internal transcribed spacer 2 were sequenced, and the results were compared with sequences deposited in the NCBI database. The G-01, G-02, and G-03 strains were identified as Diaporthe citri. This identification was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. The crude extract of the secondary metabolites of the G-01 strain was tested against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus; the metabolites showed antimicrobial activity against S. aureus. The endophytes tested in this study have potential for use in biotechnological applications.
