OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the prevalence of diverse Ambler class beta-lactamase-encoding genes in 40 carbapenem-insensitive Acinetobacter baumannii isolates collected from two hospitals in Egypt during the period January-March 2012. METHODS: The resistance levels to different groups of antimicrobial agents were determined. PCR was used to detect the different Ambler class beta-lactamases encoding the following genes: blaTEM, blaSHV, blaCTX-M, blaVEB, blaPER, blaGES, blaVIM, blaIMP, blaSIM, blaSPM, blaGIM, blaNDM, blaADC, blaOXA-23, blaOXA-24, blaOXA-51, and blaOXA-58. ISAba1 and int1 were detected by PCR. RESULTS: The isolates were 100% resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate, aztreonam, cefepime, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime. Of the isolates, 5% were resistant to colistin, 45% to amikacin, 70% to imipenem, and 85% to ciprofloxacin. The blaADC- and blaOXA-51-like genes were detected in the entire collection. The prevalences of blaOXA-23, blaOXA-24, and blaOXA-58 were 50%, 7.5%, and 5%, respectively. However, the prevalences of blaTEM-, blaPER-, and blaGES-like genes were 87.5%, 55%, and 27.5%, respectively. SHV, CTX-M, VEB, KPC, and MBL encoding genes were not detected. The ISAba1 was found upstream to blaOXA-51, blaOXA-23, and blaADC in 85%, 80%, and 50%, respectively. Of note, 45% (18/40) of the isolates co-produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (PER and GES) and carbapenemases (OXA-23 and OXA-58). CONCLUSIONS: The blaADC-, blaTEM-, blaPER-, blaOXA-23-, and blaGES-like genes were found to be the most prevalent types of beta-lactamase-encoding gene in A. baumannii collected from Egypt. A high level of carbapenem resistance is mediated by blaOXA-23, blaOXA-24, and blaOXA-58 (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 32 to >256mug/ml), and a low level of carbapenem resistance is mediated by blaGES (MIC 4-16mug/ml) and by up-regulation of ISAba1-OXA-51 (MIC 1-4mug/ml). Class B MBL was not identified to play a role in carbapenem resistance in A. baumannii isolates from Egypt.
