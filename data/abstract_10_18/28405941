PURPOSE: To evaluate knowledge and behaviours concerning antibiotics and bacterial resistance in the French population, and to identify the socio-demographic factors associated with a high level of such knowledge and appropriate behaviours. METHODS: A survey of the general population was conducted in 2015 in northeast France. The 44-item standardized questionnaire used comprised three parts, focusing on the assessment of knowledge, behaviours, and the collection of main socio-demographic characteristics of respondents (gender, age, having children, education level, and profession). The association of these characteristics with the level of knowledge about antibiotics, and with related behaviours, as well as the association between knowledge and behaviours was identified in a bivariate analysis (Chi-2 tests) and a multivariate analysis when necessary (logistic regression). RESULTS: The 200 respondents had quite a good level of knowledge about antibiotics for several points: the lack of effectiveness of antibiotics for colds (75.5%), the risk of inefficacy of antibiotics when misused (93%), and the effects of overconsumption on bacterial resistance (92%). Conversely, the effects of different doses and treatment durations on resistance were less well known. Inappropriate behaviours were frequent, especially non-adherence to dosing schedules and to treatment duration (35.5%), and self-medication practices (18%). Female gender, older age, and having children were independently associated with a good level of knowledge. A low level of education and older age were associated with appropriate behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: No association was found between knowledge and behaviours, highlighting the relevance of national public information campaigns to limit the misuse of antibiotics.
