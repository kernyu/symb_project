A total of 171 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates causing invasive disease were isolated from Chinese children. The serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance were tested. The results suggested that the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine has a preventive effect among children and that there should be long-term surveillance for serotype 19A.
