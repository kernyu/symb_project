Eravacycline is a novel broad-spectrum fluorocycline with potent Gram-negative activity, including for multidrug-resistant strains. Among 472 Escherichia coli clinical isolates from 24 Veterans Affairs medical centers (in 2011), divided equally as susceptible versus resistant to fluoroquinolones, broth microdilution eravacycline MICs were distributed unimodally, ranging from 0.03 to 1.0 mug/ml (MIC50 of 0.125 mug/ml, MIC90 of 0.25 mug/ml). Eravacycline MICs were approximately 2-fold higher among fluoroquinolone-resistant, gentamicin-resistant, multidrug-resistant, and sequence type 131 (ST131) isolates (P < 0.01 for each comparison).
