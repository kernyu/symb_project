The in vitro activity of a host defense peptidomimetic (HDM-4) was investigated. The compound exhibited an antimicrobial activity profile against a range of Gram-negative bacteria. HDM-4 permeabilized the outer membrane and partly depolarized the inner membrane at its minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). Moreover, it was demonstrated that HDM-4 was distributed widely in the bacterial cell at lethal concentrations, and that it could bind to DNA. It was confirmed that the multimodal action of HDM-4 resulted in it being less likely to lead to resistance development as compared to single-target antibiotics. HDM-4 exhibited multispecies anti-biofilm activity at sub-MIC levels. Furthermore, HDM-4 modulated the immune response by inducing the release of the chemoattractants interleukin-8 (IL-8), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and MCP-3 from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In addition, the compound suppressed lipopolysaccharide-mediated inflammation by reducing the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha.
