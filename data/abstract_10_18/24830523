We evaluated the correlation between fluoroquinolone use, measured by doses administered and days of therapy, with the emergence of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin resistance among Gram-negative bacilli infections in children hospitalized at one pediatric center between April 2001 and March 2009. Both metrics and drug resistance were highly correlated.
