Mycobacterium avium is an important intracellular pathogen, particularly in AIDS patients. It also shows the second frequency among nontuberculous mycobacteria infections in Korea. Point mutations of domain V region of the 23S rRNA gene has been known to confer clarithromycin resistance to M. avium. In order to isolate the clarithromycin-resistant strains from clinical isolates of M. avium and characterize them, we isolated the clarithromycin-resistant strains from clinical isolates of M. avium using reverse hybridization assay (RHA) and broth microdilution test (BMT). Three clarithromycin-resistant isolates with high level of MICs were found from 274 clinical isolates by BMT. Two of three resistant strains were also found by RHA, which revealed point mutations in the domain V region of the 23S rRNA. We report here clarithromycin-resistant clinical isolates of M. avium with the different characteristics from those of the resistant strains reported from earlier studies.
