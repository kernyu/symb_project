Multidrug resistant bacterial infections are one of the most important health problems in recent years. Resistance to conventional antibiotics limits the therapeutic options causing increase rate in morbid-mortality in hospitals. Therefore, new antibacterial agents with new bacterial targets have been searched and found in many different sources, including scorpion venom and scorpion hemolymph. Here, we report a new anti-microbial peptide named Vejovine. This peptide was isolated from the venom of the Mexican scorpion Vaejovis mexicanus by two steps of reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). It is composed of 47 amino acid residues with no cysteine residues in its sequence, with a molecular weight of 4873 Da. The chemical synthesis of Vejovine was performed by the solid phase method of Merrifield, using fluoren-9-ylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-amino acids. Both the native and synthetic peptides were shown to have essentially the same activity. Vejovine inhibits growth of clinical isolates of Gram-negative multidrug resistant (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Acinetobacter baumanii) causing nosocomial infections with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.4 muM up to 50 muM. This peptide has also hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes with a HC(50) value of 100 muM. A cDNA library of the venomous gland of this scorpion provided material for cloning the gene encoding Vejovine. This peptide is a new type of antibiotic, showing less than 50% similarity to other known scorpion peptides. Vejovine is a candidate to be used as a leading compound for future development of an effective peptide against multidrug resistant bacteria.
