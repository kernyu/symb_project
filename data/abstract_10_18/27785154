BACKGROUND: Chryseobacterium indologenes is an emerging opportunistic pathogen in hospital-acquired infection, which is intrinsically resistant to most antimicrobial agents against gram-negative bacteria. In the purpose of extending our understanding of the resistance mechanism of C. indologenes, we sequenced and analyzed the genome of an extensively antibiotic resistant C. indologenes strain, isolated from a Chinese prostate cancer patient. We also investigated the presence of antibiotic resistance genes, particularly metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) genes, and performed a comparative genomic analysis with other Chryseobacterium species. RESULTS: 16s rRNA sequencing indicated the isolate belongs to C. indologenes. We assembled a total of 1095M bp clean-filtered reads into 171 contigs by de novo assembly. The draft genome of C. indologenes J31 consisted of 5,830,795 bp with a GC content of 36.9 %. RAST analysis revealed the genome contained 5196 coding sequences (CDSs), 28 rRNAs, 81 tRNAs and 114 pseudogenes. We detected 90 antibiotic resistance genes from different drug classes in the whole genome. Notably, a novel blaIND allele blaIND-16 was identified, which shared 99 % identity with blaIND-8 and blaIND-10. By comparing strain J31 genome to the closely four related neighbors in the genus Chryseobacterium, we identified 2634 conserved genes, and 1449 unique genes. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we described the whole genome sequence of C. indologenes strain J31. Numerous resistance determinants were detected in the genome and might be responsible for the extensively antibiotic resistance of this strain. Comparative genomic analysis revealed the presence of considerable strain-specific genes which would contribute to the distinctive characteristics of strain J31. Our study provides the insight of the multidrug resistance mechanism in genus Chryseobacterium.
