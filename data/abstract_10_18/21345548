A series of novel 8-fluoro Norfloxacin derivatives and the hybrids of its piperazinyl derivatives incorporated with 1,3,5-triazine and pyrimidine were synthesized. All the above compounds were evaluated for their antibacterial activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin & vancomycin-resistant S. aureus. Among all, compounds having Morpholine, N-methyl/phenyl/benzyl/pyrimidinyl piperazines and n-butylamine substitution at C-7 position, have shown increased potency in comparison to norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin.
