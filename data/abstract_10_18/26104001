OBJECTIVE: To determine the number and duration of nosocomial outbreaks caused by highly resistant microorganisms (HRMO) posing a potential threat to public health, in order to undertake a risk assessment. DESIGN: Descriptive study. METHOD: Data on nosocomial outbreaks were collected from April 2012 to June 2014. The following characteristics were recorded at the start and end of each outbreak: type of microorganism, reason for reporting, phase of outbreak, number of patients colonised and infected, and infection prevention measures implemented. RESULTS: 47 medical institutions reported 87 outbreaks (mean: 3 outbreaks per month). 20 outbreaks were reported in 2012 (2.2/month), 39 in 2013 (3.3/month), and 28 in the first six months of 2014 (4.7/month). Outbreaks of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (n = 26), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; n = 23) and resistant or highly resistant Enterobacteriaceae (n = 17) were reported most frequently. 65 outbreaks (75%) were controlled within two months of reporting. CONCLUSION: Transparent reporting of HRMO outbreaks is important for correct public perceptions of the safety of hospitals and nursing homes in the Netherlands. Reports to the Hospital-acquired Infection and Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring Group show that HRMO outbreaks are an almost daily occurrence in Dutch hospitals. However, most outbreaks are quickly controlled without posing a threat to public health.
