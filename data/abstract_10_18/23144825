An antibacterial protein (about 12 kDa) was isolated from human amniotic fluid through dialysis, ultrafiltration and C18 reversed-phase HPLC steps. Automated Edman degradation showed that the N-terminal sequence of the antibacterial protein was NH(2)-Ile-Gln-Arg-Thr-Pro-Lys-Ile-Gln-Val-Tyr-Ser-Arg-His-Pro-Ala-Glu-Asn-Gly-. The N-terminal sequence of the antibacterial protein was found to be identical to that of beta(2)-microglobulin, a component of MHC class I molecules, which are present on all nucleated cells. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) revealed that the molecular mass of the antibacterial protein was 11,631 Da. This antibacterial protein, beta(2)M, possessed potent antibacterial activity against pathogenic bacteria. Specially, antibacterial activity was observed in potassium buffer, and potassium ion was found to be critical for the antibacterial activity. Interestingly, the antibacterial action of beta(2)M was associated with dissipation of the transmembrane potential, but the protein did not cause damage to the membrane that would result in SYTOX green uptake. In addition, stimulation of WISH amniotic epithelial cells with the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced dose-dependent upregulation of beta(2)M mRNA expression. These results suggest that beta(2)M contributes to a self-defense response when amniotic cells are exposed to pathogens.
