There is limited data about the long-term treatment outcome and prognosis of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in developing countries. Our study was designed to assess survival data and identify risk factors. Data of 142 children with ALL who were treated with a modified BFM 95 protocol between 1997 and 2007 were evaluated. The median age was 4.3 years. Complete remission (CR) rate after induction phase was 93.5%; with 2.1% induction-related mortality and 0.7% having resistance disease. Of complete responders, 67.1% are in continuous CR with a median follow-up of 63 months (range: 24 to 153 mo). Treatment-related mortality was 17.7% and the total rate of treatment abandonment was 3.5%. The probability of event-free survival was 67.3% (95% confidence interval 59.3-75.3) at 4 years and 63.2% (95% confidence interval 54.4-72.0) at 8 years. This report examines children with ALL treated with a modified ALL-BFM 95 protocol in a tertiary care center in Turkey with adequate follow up and demonstrates the need for improvements especially for patients with unfavorable risk group and strategies to reduce deaths from infection in CR to keep pace with cure rates in developed countries.
