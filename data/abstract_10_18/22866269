BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections (UTI) are the most commonly encountered infections in obstetric patients. Although a variety of etiology is involved, Escherichia coli and other coliforms account for a large majority of these naturally acquired infections. The estimation of local etiology and susceptibility profile could support the most effective empirical treatment. AIM: The current study was undertaken to find the spectrum of micro-organisms responsible for causing UTI in obstetric patients and to find out the most appropriate antibiotic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients in different stages of pregnancy with or without symptoms of UTI attending the antenatal clinic during November 2011 to March 2012 were screened for significant bacteriuria. The bacterial uropathogens isolated were then subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing and screened for ESBL production and methicillin resistance. RESULTS: During the 5-month study period, out of the 250 samples screened, a total of 60 (24%) samples of urine from pregnant females, in different stages of pregnancy were found to be positive on culture. The Enterobacteriaceae accounted for nearly two-thirds of the isolates and E. coli alone accounted for 63% of the urinary isolates followed by Klebsiella pneumonia 8%. Among the Gram-positive cocci, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (15%) were more frequently isolated than Staphylococcus aureus (8.3%). A significantly high resistance was noted to the beta-lactam group of antimicrobials, fluoroquinolones and cotrimoxazole, both by the Gram-negative bacilli as well as Gram-positive cocci. Resistance was quite low against the aminoglycosides and nitrofurantoin and virtually absent against imipenem. CONCLUSION: The susceptibility patterns seen in our study seem to suggest that it is absolutely necessary to obtain sensitivity reports before initiation of antibiotic therapy in cases of suspected UTI.
