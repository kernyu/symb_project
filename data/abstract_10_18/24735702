OBJECTIVES: We aimed to define priority areas for research on chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis in Canada through the use of a consensus method. METHODS: A modified Delphi method was conducted, consisting of two online surveys and an in-person meeting. Participants included people working in bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) across Canada, including clinicians, policy-makers, public health practitioners, and researchers. RESULTS: Consensus was achieved regarding the most important priority topics in bacterial STI research in Canada, within five general priority areas: the epidemiology of bacterial STIs, screening, partner notification and contact tracing, antimicrobial resistance, and identification of best practices for the prevention and control of bacterial STIs. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this consensus process can be used to inform research efforts, which could contribute to more effective control of bacterial STIs in Canada.
