After reports of the apparent failure of monepantel to reduce the egg counts of goats on a farm in the lower North Island of New Zealand, faecal egg count reduction tests were conducted in goats and lambs resident on the property, and a confirmatory, slaughter study was conducted using 12 sheep, sourced elsewhere, that were grazed on the farm for approximately 5 weeks. In the egg count reduction test in goats, 8 animals were given monepantel at 3.9 mg/kg (just over 1.5x the sheep dose rate of 2.5mg/kg), whilst four received 7.7 mg/kg (just over 3x the sheep dose). In the egg count reduction test in sheep, 15 lambs were treated with 3.0mg/kg of monepantel. For the confirmatory study, the sheep were housed indoors for 2 weeks before half were treated with 2.9 mg/kg monepantel and the animals were killed for worm counts 9 days later. There was no evidence of efficacy in either egg count reduction test, or in the goats, the two dose rates used appeared equally ineffective. Likewise, there were no significant reductions in egg counts or worm burdens in the slaughter study. Monepantel was ineffective against at least two gastrointestinal nematode species, Teladorsagia circumcincta and Trichostrongylus colubriformis. These findings represent the first report from the field of resistance having developed to the anthelmintic monepantel with severe resistance developing in more than one species after being administered on 17 separate occasions to different stock classes and in less than 2 years of the product first being used on the farm in question.
