In this study, a combination of catalytic and biotechnological processes was proposed for the first time for application in a cellulose biorefinery for the production of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) and bioethanol. Hydrolytic dehydration of the mechanically activated microcrystalline cellulose over a carbon-based mesoporous Sibunt-4 catalyst resulted in moderate yields of glucose and 5-HMF (21.1-25.1 and 6.6-9.4 %). 5-HMF was extracted from the resulting mixture with isobutanol and subjected to ethanol fermentation. A number of yeast strains were isolated that also revealed high thermotolerance (up to 50 degrees C) and resistance to inhibitors found in the hydrolysates. The strains Kluyveromyces marxianus C1 and Ogataea polymorpha CBS4732 were capable of producing ethanol from processed catalytic hydrolysates of cellulose at 42 degrees C, with yields of 72.0+/-5.7 and 75.2+/-4.3 % from the maximum theoretical yield of ethanol, respectively.
