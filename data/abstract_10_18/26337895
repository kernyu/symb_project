Serratia marcescens strain AH0650_Sm1 is a clinical multidrug-resistant isolate from Australia. Here, we report its annotated draft genome comprising 20 contigs. We identified chromosomal antimicrobial resistance genes including a tet(41) variant, an aac(6')-Ic variant, ampC, a metallo-beta-lactamase, and several putative multidrug efflux pumps, as well as a novel prophage.
