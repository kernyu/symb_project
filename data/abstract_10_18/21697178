BACKGROUND: The MIC corresponding to daptomycin susceptibility for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) is </= 4 mg/L. Based on the concentration-dependent killing properties of daptomycin, there may be concern about achieving adequate concentrations when the MIC approaches the upper end of the susceptible range (3-4 mg/L). Higher doses of daptomycin may be needed to treat VRE isolates with higher MICs. METHODS: We conducted a single-centre retrospective chart review of adult cases with VRE bacteraemia who received daptomycin as initial therapy. The primary outcome was time to microbiological cure (TMC) between standard doses (</= 6 mg/kg) and high doses (> 6 mg/kg) of daptomycin and whether TMC differed based on MICs. The secondary outcome evaluated the daptomycin MIC distribution and assessed whether recent exposure to vancomycin was associated with higher daptomycin MICs. RESULTS: Forty-six cases were included in the primary analysis and 60.9% of patients were neutropenic. The two dose groups differed in the baseline characteristics of age, body mass index, blood culture source and catheter removal. Median TMC was 2 days for both dose groups. There was no significant difference in TMC between MIC subgroups of </= 2 mg/L versus >2 and </= 4 mg/L. For the secondary analysis 227 VRE isolates were evaluated and 62% had daptomycin MICs of 3-4 mg/L. Each daptomycin MIC group had a similar incidence of prior vancomycin exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this retrospective review we did not observe a difference in TMC based on daptomycin dose and MIC; however, there were various limitations to this study, and the study was not powered to detect a difference in TMC. Also, prior vancomycin exposure did not appear to influence daptomycin MICs. The frequency of daptomycin MICs of 3-4 mg/L reported in this study is higher than those reported in the literature.
