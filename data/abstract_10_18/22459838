Antimicrobials are often used for treatment of bovine mastitis and the possibility of selection for resistant bacteria must be considered. The objectives of this study were to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration of Staphylococcus aureus recovered from cases of clinical and subclinical bovine mastitis, and to determine the prevalence of multidrug resistance in this population. Milk samples were collected from cows on commercial dairy herds (n=13), including quarters (n=1,574) of cows with subclinical mastitis cases, and cows experiencing clinical mastitis cases (n=608). Selected Staph. aureus isolates, obtained from clinical (n=58) and subclinical (n=58) mastitis cases, were used to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations of 12 selected antimicrobials. Of Staph. aureus isolates tested, 87 (75%) did not exhibit resistance to any antimicrobial, 28 (24.1%) exhibited resistance to 1 (n=21) or 2 (n=7) classes of antimicrobials, and 1 (0.9%) exhibited multidrug resistance. All Staph. aureus (clinical and subclinical cases) were inhibited by the range of concentrations tested for ceftiofur and oxacillin. Moreover, no isolates obtained from clinical mastitis cases exhibited resistance to cephalothin, penicillin-novobiocin, or sulfadimethoxine. Of isolates, 3 exhibited resistance to enrofloxacin. Of isolates exhibiting resistance to more than 1 antimicrobial, independent of antimicrobial class, the combination of erythromycin and tetracycline, and ampicillin and penicillin accounted for the majority of resistance. Of isolates tested, 19% were resistant to tetracycline and 14% were resistant to penicillin. Survival curves of Staph. aureus relative to minimum inhibitory concentration demonstrated heterogeneity among case types for ceftiofur, cephalothin, and erythromycin. Multidrug resistance was identified in only 1 isolate obtained from a single farm.
