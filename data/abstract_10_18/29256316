Antimicrobial resistance has emerged as a major challenge to modern medicine and it has become urgent to seek alternative approaches to treat infections caused by fast-evolving multi-resistant clones of bacillary dysentery-causing Shigella sonnei. Here, we show that geraniol, a natural substance present in the essential oils of plants such as rose and lemongrass, can reduce S. sonnei proliferation inside host cells and protect Galleria mellonella larvae from killing by S. sonnei infection. We present evidence that geraniol competitively inhibits the catalytic activity of the master virulence regulator, DsbA, a periplasmic disulphide bond oxidoreductase required for Shigella survival in the host cell cytosol. Our observations suggest that geraniol holds a great therapeutic potential that should be further exploited.
