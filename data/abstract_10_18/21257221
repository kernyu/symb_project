Follow-up of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients treated with Nevirapine (NVP) is a necessary process to evaluate the drug resistance and the HIV mutation. It is also usually tested by immunochromatographic (IC) strip test. However, it is difficult to estimate the amount of drug the patient gets by visually inspection of color. In this paper, we propose an automatic interpretation system using a commercialized optical scanner. Several IC strips can be placed at any direction as long as they are on the scanner plate. There are three steps in the system, i.e., light intensity normalization, image segmentation and NVP concentration interpretation. We utilized the Support Vector Regression to interpret the NVP concentration. From the results, we found out the performance of the system is promising and better than that of the linear and nonlinear regression.
