Eleven multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli isolates (comprising 6 porcine and 5 bovine field isolates) displaying fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance were selected from a collection obtained from the University Veterinary Hospital (Dublin, Ireland). MICs of nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin were determined by Etest. All showed MICs of nalidixic acid of >256 mug/ml and MICs of ciprofloxacin ranging from 4 to >32 mug/ml. DNA sequencing was used to identify mutations within the quinolone resistance-determining regions of target genes, and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to evaluate the expression of the major porin, OmpF, and component genes of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump and its associated regulatory loci. Decreased MIC values to nalidixic acid and/or ciprofloxacin were observed in the presence of the efflux pump inhibitor phenylalanine-arginine-beta-naphthylamide (PAbetaN) in some but not all isolates. Several mutations were identified in genes coding for quinolone target enzymes (3 to 5 mutations per strain). All isolates harbored GyrA amino acid substitutions at positions 83 and 87. Novel GyrA (Asp87 --> Ala), ParC (Ser80 --> Trp), and ParE (Glu460 --> Val) substitutions were observed. The efflux activity of these isolates was evaluated using a semiautomated ethidium bromide (EB) uptake assay. Compared to wild-type E. coli K-12 AG100, isolates accumulated less EB, and in the presence of PAbetaN the accumulation of EB increased. Upregulation of the acrB gene, encoding the pump component of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump, was observed in 5 of 11 isolates, while 10 isolates showed decreased expression of OmpF. This study identified multiple mechanisms that likely contribute to resistance to quinolone-based drugs in the field isolates studied.
