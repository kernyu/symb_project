Despite multiple advances in prostate cancer therapy, treatment options for castration resistant disease are very limited. While data from recent studies are encouraging, there is no drug that has significantly improved results of standard chemotherapy. Some of the most consistent results are provided by antiangiogenic agents, showing high response rates and manageable toxicity. We describe some of the main therapeutic angiogenesis inhibitors in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. These agents include vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, antiangiogenic and inmunomodulatory agents and endothelin receptor antagonists.
