Visceral leishmaniasis is a deadly endemic disease. Unresponsiveness to the only available oral drug miltefosine poses a big challenge for the chemotherapy of the disease. We report a novel molecule, PS-203 {4-(4,4,8-trimethyl-7-oxo-3-oxabicyclo[3.3.1]non-2-yl)-benzoic acid methyl ester}, as effective against a miltefosine-unresponsive strain of the parasite. Further, combinations of PS-203 with miltefosine were also evaluated and showed promising results against a miltefosine-unresponsive strain.
