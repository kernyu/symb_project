Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was used to investigate the genetic features of the recently identified lsa(E) gene in porcine S. aureus ST9 isolates. Three quinupristin/dalfopristin-resistant isolates harboring the lsa(E) gene (two MRSA and one MSSA) were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis of 184S. aureus genomes showed that ST9 porcine isolates belong to a distinct sequence cluster. Further analysis showed that all isolates were deficient in the recently described type IV restriction-modification system and SCCmec type XII was identified in the two MRSA isolates, which included a rare class C2 mec gene complex. A 24kb PsiSCC fragment was found in the MRSA and MSSA isolates sharing 99% nucleotide sequence homology with the PsiSCCJCSC6690 (O-2) element of a ST9 MRSA isolate from Thailand (accession number AB705453). Comparison of these ST9 isolates with 181 publically available S. aureus genomes identified 24 genes present in all (100%) ST9 isolates, that were absent from the most closely related human isolate. Our analysis suggests that the sequenced quinupristin/dalfopristin-resistant ST9 lineage represent a reservoir of mobile genetic elements associated with resistance and virulence features.
