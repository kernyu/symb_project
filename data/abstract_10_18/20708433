The inhibitory effect of amphotericin B (AMPH) on the growth of fungi during the isolation of thraustochytrids was examined. The growth of fungi was significantly inhibited by addition of AMPH, and therefore colonies of thraustochytrids were not overlaid with fungal mycelia, which resulted in increased efficiency of thraustochytrids isolation.
