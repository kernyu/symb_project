Background: Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing is a significant resistant mechanism to beta-lactams in Enterobacteriaceae, especially in Klebsiella pneumoniae. The main objectives of this study were to genetically characterize urinary clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae through the investigating of blaTEM, blaCTX-M and using molecular typing by Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus polymerase chain reaction (ERIC-PCR) method. We also determined the frequency of antibiotic resistance of K. pneumoniae strains to characterize the beta-lactamases included. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out to evaluate 98 strains of K. pneumoniae isolated from urine culture of outpatients referred to Al-Zahra Hospital, Isfahan, Iran. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using Kirby-Bauer's method. Screening of ESBLs was carried out using double-disk screening test. PCR technique was performed to detect TEM and CTX-M genes. The total DNA of each strain was tested by ERIC-PCR. Results: In 98 K. pneumoniae studied clinical isolates, 25.5% were ESBL producing and 44.9% multidrug-resistant (MDR). From 25 ESBL isolates, 23 (92%) cases showed MDR phenotype. In ESBL producing isolates, 23 (92%) were blaCTX-M and 19 (76%) blaTEM positive. The antimicrobial drug susceptibilities of ESBL isolates indicated high resistant rates for cefotaxime and ceftazidime. All 25 ESBL producing isolates were resistant to cefotaxime. Complex patterns of fingerprints isolates showed that 36% of the isolates were belonged to the cluster no 5. Conclusion: This study revealed high antimicrobial resistance rates among ESBL isolates which can lead to various health difficulties. Epidemiological data collection from patients is recommended to develop the strategies to manage antibiotic resistance.
