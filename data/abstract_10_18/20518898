Only a few reports have described regression of rectal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma after antibiotic treatment are generally found to be successful for gastric tumors. We examined eight rectal MALT lymphomas treated with antibiotic treatments to determine whether they regressed after treatment. We also discuss the relationship between rectal MALT lymphomas and MALT1 gene genetic abnormalities. Eight patients who had undergone antibiotic treatments were followed up with colonoscopy after initiation of the treatment. In five of the eight cases (63%) endoscopic examination showed that the rectal tumor had disappeared, which was confirmed histologically. Polymerase chain reaction for immunoglobulin heavy chain identified a monoclonal band in seven of eight cases (88%). Of the eight cases analyzed with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for MALT1 translocation, two demonstrated MALT1 gene genetic abnormality. These cases tended to be resistant to antibiotic treatment. Investigation and analysis of a large number of rectal MALT lymphomas are needed to establish suitable standards for antibiotic treatment.
