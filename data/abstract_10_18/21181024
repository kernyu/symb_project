INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to characterize the prevalence and susceptibility profile to oxacillin-resistant Coagulase-negative Staphylococci strains isolated from blood cultures in a teaching hospital, located in Santa Maria, RS. In addition, different methodologies for phenotypic characterization of mecA-mediated oxacillin resistance were compared with genotypic reference testing. METHODS: After identification (MicroScan - Siemens), the isolates were tested for antimicrobial sensitivity using disk diffusion and automation (MicroScan - Siemens). The presence of mecA gene was identified by the polymerase chain reaction molecular technique. RESULTS: The most common species was Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=40, 67%). The mecA gene was detected in 54 (90%) strains, while analysis of the sensitivity profiles revealed a high rate of resistance to multiple classes of antimicrobial drugs. However, all isolates were uniformly sensitive to vancomycin and tigecycline. The cefoxitin disk was the phenotypic method that best correlated with the gold standard. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the clinical significance of CoNS isolated from hemocultures and the precise detection of oxacillin resistance represent decisive factors for the correct choice of antibiotic therapy. Although vancomycin constitutes the normal treatment in most Brazilian hospitals, reduction in its use is recommended.
