UNLABELLED: The aim of this study was to determine adhesion and colonization of bacteria on the surface of originally synthesized glass-ceramic biomaterials and their effect on inflammation reactions in tissues surrounding the implant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Biomaterial discs were contaminated with bacterial suspensions of 10, 10(2), and 10(3) colony forming units (CFU)/mL (P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and S. epidermidis ATCC 12228), and after 2 hours of cultivation, the intensity of bacterial adhesion was determined. For in vivo tests, the samples were contaminated with 102 and 103 CFU/mL cultivated at 37 degrees C for 2 h to ensure bacterial adhesion. Contaminated biomaterial samples were implanted in the interscapular area of chinchilla rabbits for 2 and 4 weeks. The biomaterials were removed, and using plate count and sonification methods, bacterial colonization on the surface of biomaterials was determined. Moreover, the expression of TNF-alpha, beta-defensin 2, and IL-10 in the surrounding tissues was assessed by using immunohistochemistry methods. RESULTS: P. aeruginosa more intensively colonized biomaterials in the in vivo study as compared with S. epidermidis. Il-10 is a regulatory cytokine, which reduces the intensity of inflammatory cell activity, thus reducing nonspecific resistance of the organism. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of TNF-alpha and IL-10 was not affected by short (2 and 4 weeks) biomaterial implantation. Pronounced cytokine expression in tissues around implanted biomaterials contaminated with P. aeruginosa was observed.
