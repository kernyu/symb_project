BACKGROUND: Multidrug resistant strains of Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR-AB) have emerged as alarming nosocomial pathogens among patients admitted to Intensive Care Unit and burned patients. The aim of this study was to determine the susceptibility of A. baumannii isolates, the carbapenems resistance patterns bla(OXA-23) and also ISAba elements of A. baumannii isolates among burned and ICU patients in Tehran and Sari, Iran. METHODS: In this study, 100 A. baumannii isolates from burned and ICU patients in Tehran and Sari (Iran) during 2013 were tested for determination of antimicrobials susceptibility by the disc-diffusion method on Mueller Hinton agar recommended by the guidelines of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), and frequency bla(OXA-23) carbapenemase genes, and insertion elements ISAba genes were studied by PCR method. RESULTS: The highest rates of susceptibility were observed with Colistin (88.7%), Tigecycline (82.2%), Imipenem (67%) and ISAba (32.2%). The extensively drug-resistance and pan drug-resistance were observed in 37.1% and 8.1% isolates, respectively. Results indicated among isolates resistant to Aminoglycoside and Carbapenem, the highest resistance was observed to Streptomycin (90%) ' and the most sensitivity was to Imipenem (67%). CONCLUSIONS: This is the most study that attempted to detect Acinetobacter baumanii the insertion elements ISAba , bla(OXA-23) and aminoglycosides resistance in MDR-AB isolates from burned and ICU patients in Iran. In a timely manner, antimicrobial resistance surveillance and strict infection control strategies are still lacking in burn ward and ICU in Iran, despite the alarming emergence of MDR-AB strains, particularly among those isolates that are not susceptible to Colistin. The results of this study are consistent with a recent report in which a number of combinations exhibited potent activity against Multidrug resistant strains of A. baumannii (MDR-AB).
