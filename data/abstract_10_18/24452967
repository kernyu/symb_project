Metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) production in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a growing issue across the globe. Fast and reliable diagnostic tools are needed for appropriate implementation of infection control measures. In this study we evaluated the performance of three commercial combined disk tests, two EDTA based in-house combined disk tests and the Carba NP test in comparison to molecular detection of MBL genes on 133 meropenem non-susceptible non-duplicate P. aeruginosa clinical isolates. The meropenem/DPA based commercial KPC + MBL-confirm ID kit (Rosco Diagnostica, Denmark) and the MASTDISCS ID carbapenemase (Enterobacteriaceae) detection disc set (MAST Diagnostics, UK) showed sensitivities of 31.1 % and 28.8 % and specificities of 69.3 % and 79.6 %, respectively. The total MBL confirm kit (Rosco Diagnostica, Denmark) contains imipenem/DPA and imipenem/EDTA combination disks. Evaluation of the single disk combinations revealed 84.4 % sensitivity and 81.8 % specificity for the imipenem/DPA assay and 86.7 % sensitivity and 51.1 % specificity for the imipenem/EDTA test. Applying both tests simultaneously resulted in a slightly higher sensitivity of 88.9 % but a lower specificity of 48.9 % when compared to the single tests alone. The Carba NP test showed 93.3 % sensitivity and 96.6 % specificity. All phenotypic combined disk tests lacked either sensitivity or specificity for the detection of MBL in P. aeruginosa. The Carba NP test showed excellent test properties, but suffers from drawbacks in handling and high costs. The optimal diagnostic approach needs to be chosen depending on the epidemiological situation, laboratory resources and availability of molecular confirmation tests.
