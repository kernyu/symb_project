Mycobacterium abscessus subsp. bolletii is a rapidly growing mycobacterial organism for which the taxonomy is unclear. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of a Mycobacterium abscessus subsp. bolletii type strain. This sequence will provide essential information for future taxonomic and comparative genome studies of these mycobacteria.
