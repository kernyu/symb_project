The spread of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase gene (NDM-1)-producing bacteria has become a growing concern to the medical community worldwide. In this study, we reported 4 NDM-1-positive Enterobacteriaceae isolates recovered from two Taiwanese patients having travel history. The beta-lactamase genetic background, antimicrobial susceptibility, clonal relationships, and plasmid sizes of the NDM-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae were investigated. This report highlights the alarming introduction of NDM-1 gene among Enterobacteriaceae in Taiwan.
