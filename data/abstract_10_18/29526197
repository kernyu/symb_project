Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has become a rapid and affordable tool for public health surveillance and outbreak detection. In this study, we used the Illuminia MiSeq((R)) to sequence 589 Campylobacter isolates obtained in 2015 from retail poultry meats as part of the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS). WGS data were used to identify the Campylobacter species and to compare the concordance between resistance genotypes and phenotypes. WGS accurately identified 386 C. jejuni and 203 C. coli using gyrA sequence information. Ten resistance genes, including tetO, blaOXA-61, aph(2'')-Ic, aph(2'')-If, aph(2'')-Ig, aph(3')-III, ant(6)-1a, aadE, aph(3")-VIIa, and Inu(C), plus mutations in housekeeping genes (gyrA at position 86, 23S rRNA at position 2074 and 2075), were identified by WGS analysis. Overall, there was a high concordance between phenotypic resistance to a given drug and the presence of known resistance genes. Concordance between both resistance and susceptible phenotypes and genotype was 100% for ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, gentamicin, azithromycin, and florfenicol. A few discrepancies were observed for tetracycline, clindamycin, and telithromycin. The concordance between resistance phenotype and genotype ranged from 67.9% to 100%; whereas, the concordance between susceptible phenotype and genotype ranged from 98.0% to 99.6%. Our study demonstrates that WGS can correctly identify Campylobacter species and predict antimicrobial resistance with a high degree of accuracy.
