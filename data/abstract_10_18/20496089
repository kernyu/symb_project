In third-world countries, dried blood samples (DBS) are a convenient alternative to plasma for monitoring viral load during HIV-1 therapy. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of using DBS to perform HIV-1 drug resistance genotyping in a ViroSeq assay in which the protease and reverse transcriptase regions of the pol gene are analyzed. Fifty-seven antiretroviral genotypes from plasma samples were tested, and drug resistance genotypes were determined. Only 38.6% paired DBS samples were sequenced. Failure to amplify DNA from DBS samples generally correlated with plasma viral loads below log(10) 5.1. The majority of the mutations identified in plasma pol sequences were also found in their DBS counterpart, with a concordance in genotype interpretation of 96.4%. Several factors were identified that could potentially improve both the sensitivity and the quality of genotype data, such as sample storage conditions and sequence analysis. Therefore, DBS sampling is useful to determine viral load and drug resistance genotypes in HIV patients.
