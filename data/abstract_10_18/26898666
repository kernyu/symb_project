Multi-azole resistant Aspergillus fumigatus carrying TR46/Y121F/T289A was isolated from a patient in Japan in Dec 2013. This strain grouped into the same clade of the ones which were clinically isolated in France and Germany. A. fumigatus harboring this mutation could be rapidly diffused outside the Eurasian continent.
