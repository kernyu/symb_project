It is important to understand the dynamics of tetracycline-resistant bacteria (TRB) and tetracycline resistance genes (TRGs) in bulk and rhizosphere soils for evaluating the spread of TRGs from pig manure to human. In this work, a greenhouse experiment was conducted to investigate the difference in abundance of TRB, tetracycline-resistant Escherichia coli (TRE), tetracycline-resistant Pseudomonas spp. (TRP), and TRGs between bulk and cucumber rhizosphere soils. The application of pig manure resulted in the long-term persistence of TRB, TRE, TRP, and TRGs in bulk soil and rhizosphere of cucumber for at least 65 days. Pig manure application dose was the major driving force in altering the abundances of TRB and TRE, whereas TRP was disturbed mainly by compartment (bulk soil or rhizosphere). Both TRE and the percentage of TRE in bulk and rhizosphere soils increased linearly with an increase in dose of pig manure. The exponential relationships between pig manure dose and TRP along with TRP percentage were also noted. There were significant differences in the relative abundances of TRGs between bulk and cucumber rhizosphere soils, suggesting the use of pig manure exerted a more lasting impact on the spread of TRGs in the rhizosphere than in the bulk soil.
