A total of 521 unique clinical isolates from cancer patients with primarily (>90%) bloodstream infections were tested for susceptibility to ceftazidime-avibactam and comparators using broth microdilution methods. Ceftazidime-avibactam inhibited 97.8% of all Enterobacteriaceae (n = 321) at the susceptibility breakpoint of </=8/4 mug/ml (there were 7 nonsusceptible strains). It was also active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (91.7% isolates susceptible, n = 121), including many isolates not susceptible to meropenem, cefepime, ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, or other comparators.
