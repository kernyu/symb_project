Background Obesity is associated with a state of systemic inflammation, mediated by adipose tissue-derived cytokines that may also have metabolic effects, including an effect on insulin resistance. The aim of this study was to compare the serum profile of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in obese and non-obese subjects. Methods A total of 242 subjects who were either overweight or obese (body mass index [BMI] >/= 25 kg/m(2)) and non-obese subjects (body mass index <25 kg/m(2)), were recruited in Mashhad in northeastern Iran. The concentrations of serum interleukin-1alpha, -1beta, -2, -4, -6, -8 and -10 (IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10), were measured in all subjects, together with serum vascular endothelial growth factor, interferon-gamma, epidermal growth factor, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha. Results The groups differed significantly with respect to measures of adiposity and fasted lipid profile. Serum pro-inflammatory cytokines interferon-gamma and interleukin-1alpha, and anti-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-10, and epidermal growth factor were significantly different between obese and non-obese individuals, as was serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Multivariate regression showed that waist circumference was significantly and independently related to serum monocyte chemoattractant protein-1concentrations ( P = 0.001). Conclusion Despite significant differences in several cytokines between the groups, only monocyte chemoattractant protein-1appeared to be independently related to a measure of adiposity in this population sample from Iran.
