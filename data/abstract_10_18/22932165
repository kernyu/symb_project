BACKGROUND: Appropriate antimicrobial therapy of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is mainly based on the distribution of etiology and antimicrobial resistance of major pathogens. We performed a prospective observational study of adult with CAP in 36 hospitals in China. METHODS: Etiological pathogens were isolated in each of the centers, and all of the isolated pathogens were sent to Zhongshan Hospital for antimicrobial susceptibility tests using agar dilution. RESULTS: A total of 593 patients were enrolled in this study, and 242 strains of bacteria were isolated from 225 patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae (79/242, 32.6%) was the most frequently isolated pathogen, followed by Haemophilus influenzae (55/242, 22.7%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (25/242, 10.3%). Totally 527 patients underwent serological tests for atypical pathogens; Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae infections were identified in 205 (38.9%) and 60 (11.4%) patients respectively. Legionella pneumophila infections were identified in 4.0% (13/324) of patients. The non-susceptibility rate of isolated Streptococcus pneumoniae to erythromycin and penicillin was 63.2% and 19.1% respectively. Six patients died from the disease, the 30-day mortality rate was 1.1% (6/533). CONCLUSIONS: The top three bacteria responsible for CAP in Chinese adults were Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenza and Klebsiella pneumonia. There was also a high prevalence of atypical pathogens and mixed pathogens. The resistance rates of the major isolated pathogens were relatively low except for the high prevalence of macrolide resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae.
