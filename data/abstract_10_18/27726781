Yeasts are unicellular organisms that reproduce mostly by budding and less often by fission. Most medically important yeasts originate from Ascomycota or Basidiomycota. Here, we review taxonomy, epidemiology, disease spectrum, antifungal drug susceptibility patterns of medically important yeast, laboratory diagnosis, and diagnostic strategies.
