BACKGROUND: Until 2006, the Mauritanian Ministry of Health recommended chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine for first- and second-line treatment of uncomplicated malaria, respectively. This study assessed the clinical efficacy of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in Kobeni as first-line treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 55 patients with Plasmodium falciparum infections, who were treated with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and followed up for 28 days. Isolates were genotyped to distinguish between recrudescence and reinfection. Treatment success rates and survival were analysed per protocol to evaluate drug efficacy. RESULTS: After inclusion, 2 patients were excluded for protocol violations, and 3 patients were lost to follow-up. Of the remaining 50 patients (per protocol population), 43 (86%) had adequate clinical and parasitological responses. Of the 7 patients with treatment failure, 5 (10%) were early failures, while 2 (4%) had initially responded and had late clinical failure on day 7, associated with recrudescence. With the exception of one adult weighing 91 kg, all treatment failures occurred in children aged from 7 to 12 years. CONCLUSIONS: Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine monotherapy was moderately effective but insufficiently reliable in view of the relatively high rate of early treatment failure. The high prevalence of chloroquine resistance found in earlier studies and the results of the present study on sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine justify the change in national policy and systematic use of artemisinin-based combination therapy for first-line treatment of P. falciparum malaria in Mauritania.
