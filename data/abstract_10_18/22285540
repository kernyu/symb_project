Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a systemic disorder with a high mortality, commonly associated with rheumatological conditions, but which can also occur as a complication of several infections. Here we present a case of MAS following Acinetobacter baumannii sepsis. Early institution of therapy with prednisolone, cyclosporine, colistin, and polymyxin resulted in a prompt clinical recovery. There are very few reported cases of Acinetobacter-related MAS that have been successfully treated.
