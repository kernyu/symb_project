The objective was to characterize vaginal bacteria, their antimicrobial sensitivity, and the incidence of vaginitis, in goats before and after insertion of intravaginal sponges containing progesterone. Sponges were inserted in 37 Saanen goats and removed after 6, 9 or 12d (G6, G9 and G12). At sponge removal, all goats had clinical signs of vaginitis. Sampling was conducted just before sponge insertion and at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h after sponge removal. Vaginal secretions were subjected to standard bacteriological procedures, including isolation of bacteria, subculture, and determination of sensitivity to antimicrobials (gentamicin, cefalotin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, penicillin G and cefoxitin). Ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, tetracycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were the most effective for coliforms (100% sensitivity), whereas ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and tetracycline were the most effective for cocci (100, 98.6 and 97.2% sensitivity, respectively). In contrast, the least effective antimicrobials were cefalotin for the coliforms, and penicillin for the cocci (37.5 and 64.4% sensitivity, respectively), regardless of duration of implant presence and interval from implant removal to sampling. In conclusion, insertion of intravaginal progestin-impregnated sponges induced clinical vaginitis in goats. Members of Staphylococcus genus were the most frequently recovered species of the vaginal samples cultured, and all isolates were resistant to several antimicrobials.
