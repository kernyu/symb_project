BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of most common pediatric infections. The aim of this study was to investigate the etiology and antimicrobial resistance patterns of hospitalized children in our center. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, descriptive study of all UTIs from January 1, 2013 to November 31, 2016 in children discharged from Nanjing Children's Hospital. The isolated pathogens and their resistance patterns were examined from midstream urine culture. RESULTS: A total of 2316 children with UTIs were included in our study. The occurrence rates of isolated pathogens were: Enterococcus spp. (35.15%), Escherichia coli (22.32%), Staphylococcus aureus spp. (7.73%), Streptococcus spp. (7.51%), and Klebsiella spp. (6.95%). Uropathogens had a low susceptibility to Linezolid (3.47%), Vancomycin (0.92%), Imipenem (5.74%), and Amikacin (3.17%); however, they had a high susceptibility to Erythromycin (90.52%), Penicillin G (74.01%), Cefotaxime (71.41%), Cefazolin (73.41%), Cefuroxime (72.52%), and Aztreonam (70.11%). CONCLUSIONS: There is high antibiotic resistance in hospitalized children with UTIs. Susceptibility testing should be carried out on all clinical isolates, and the empirical antibiotic treatment should be altered accordingly. This article is protected by copyright.
