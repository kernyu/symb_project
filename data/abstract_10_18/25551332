Acquiring antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria through consuming contaminated animal food products is an emerging public health concern, though the sources of contamination are not always clear. This study characterized the occurrence of AMR in Escherichia coli from bivalve molluscs and assessed for the possible sources in the Hillsborough river complex of Prince Edward Island, Canada in areas overlapping with an oyster fishery. Multivariable statistical analysis indicated that the probability of detecting E. coli increased as the estimated dosage of animal effluent contamination decreased. Isolates with AMR were only found from sampling sites closest to untreated human effluent sources. Twenty-seven percent (n=6 of 22) of the isolates were pathogenic, with virulence factors consistent with extraintestinal E. coli of human origin. Though there is more evidence of contamination arising from human effluent, more research is needed to identify driving sources.
