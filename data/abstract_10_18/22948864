Infections with vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA) have been associated with vancomycin treatment failures and poor clinical outcomes. Routine identification of clinical isolates with increased vancomycin MICs remains challenging, and no molecular marker exists to aid in diagnosis of VISA strains. We tested vancomycin susceptibilities by using microscan, Etest, and population analyses in a collection of putative VISA, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (VSSA) infectious isolates from community- or hospital-associated S. aureus infections (n = 77) and identified 22 VISA and 9 heterogeneous VISA (hVISA) isolates. Sequencing of VISA candidate loci vraS, vraR, yvqF, graR, graS, walR, walK, and rpoB revealed a high diversity of nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). For vraS, vraR, yvqF, walK, and rpoB, SNPs were more frequently present in VISA and hVISA than in VSSA isolates, whereas mutations in graR, graS, and walR were exclusively detected in VISA isolates. For each of the individual loci, SNPs were only detected in about half of the VISA isolates. All but one VISA isolate had at least one SNP in any of the genes sequenced, and isolates with an MIC of 6 or 8 mug/ml harbored at least 2 SNPs. Overall, increasing vancomycin MICs were paralleled by a higher proportion of isolates with SNPs. Depending on the clonal background, SNPs appeared to preferentially accumulate in vraS and vraR for sequence type 8 (ST8) and in walK and walR for ST5 isolates. Taken together, by comparing VISA, hVISA, and VSSA controls, we observed preferential clustering of SNPs in VISA candidate genes, with an unexpectedly high diversity across these loci. Our results support a polygenetic etiology of VISA.
