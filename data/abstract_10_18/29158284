Relebactam is an important beta-lactamase inhibitor for certain aerobic organisms, but alone it has no antianaerobic activity, with most anaerobes having MICs of >/=32 mug/ml with the exception of a very few strains. There was no enhancement or antagonism of imipenem activity with the addition of relebactam, including activity against imipenem-resistant strains. The relebactam-imipenem combination had excellent overall activity against the anaerobes tested.
