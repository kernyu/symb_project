BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as an important pathogen in hospital and environment that can acquire transport element and antibiotic-resistant genes. The aim of this study was to determine the resistances to different antibiotics, frequency of Class 1 integron in A. baumannii and then molecular typing for A. baumannii isolated from Intensive Care Unit (ICU). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 100 isolates of A. baumannii were collected from patients admitted to hospitals in Kermanshah from April 2014 to September 2015. The isolates were identified using biochemical test. Antimicrobial susceptibility test for 20 antibiotics was determined by Kirby-Bauer antibiotic testing (or disc diffusion). The prevalence rate of class integrons among the isolates was determined using polymerase chain reaction and finally 80 isolates of A. baumannii obtained from the Intensive Care Unit were selected for molecular typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). RESULTS: The maximum drug resistance was observed against cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, mezlocillin, imipenem, and ceftazidime and piperacillin. Twenty-nine isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR); about 21 isolates were extensively-drug resistant and none were pandrug resistance and 42 isolates (42%) contained Class 1 integrons. The results did not show a significant correlation between the presence of Class 1 integrons and incidence of MDR A. baumannii. Five clusters were obtained by PFGE. CONCLUSION: This study did not show a significant correlation between the presence of Class 1 integrons and incidence of MDR A. baumannii. By PFGE analysis, the high level of similarity between some pulsotypes in A. baumannii strains showed genetic correlation between them.
