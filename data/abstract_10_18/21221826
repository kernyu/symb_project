Despite advances in surgical and medical therapy, glioblastoma consistently remains a fatal disease. Over the last 20 years, no significant increase in survival has been achieved for patients with this disease. The formation of abnormal tumor vasculature and glioma cell invasion along white matter tracts are believed to be the major factors responsible for the resistance of these tumors to treatment. Therefore, investigation of angiogenesis and invasion in glioblastoma is essential for the development of a curative therapy. In our report, we first reviewed certain histopathological studies that focus on angiogenesis and invasion of human malignant gliomas. Second, we considered several animal models of glioma available for studying angiogenesis and invasion, including our novel animal models. Third, we focused on the molecular aspects of glioma angiogenesis and invasion, and the key mediators of these processes. Finally, we discussed the recent and ongoing clinical trials targeting tumor angiogenesis and invasion in glioma patients. A better understanding of the mechanism of glioma angiogenesis and invasion will lead to the development of new treatment methods.
