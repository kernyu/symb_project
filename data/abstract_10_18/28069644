This study investigated the characteristics of Escherichia coli isolates carrying mcr-1-blaNDM from a chicken farm in China. Of the 78 E. coli isolates, 21 clonally unrelated isolates carried mcr-1-blaNDM Diverse IncI2 plasmids disseminated mcr-1, while the dissemination of blaNDM was mediated by diverse IncB/O plasmids. More striking was the colocalization of resistance genes mcr-1 and blaNDM-4 in an IncHI2/ST3 plasmid, which might pose a great challenge for public health.
