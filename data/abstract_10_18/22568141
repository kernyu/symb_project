Nucleoside and nucleotide analogues are potent oral inhibitors for hepatitis B virus proliferation. In Japan, we can use lamivudine, adefovir and entecavir for hepatitis B at present. Entecavir is a first choice drug because it has stronger anti-viral potency and less induction for drug-resistance viruses than other drugs. Using these drugs, we can now control hepatitis caused by hepatitis B virus on treatment in a majority of patients. Next goal will be cure of hepatitis B, but there still remains further progress.
