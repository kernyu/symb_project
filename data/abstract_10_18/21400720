The aim of this prospective study was too asses the frequency and clinical significance of metabolic syndrome (MS), insulin resistance (IR) and hepatic steatosis in 114 patients with chronic hepatitis C (HCV) genotype 1. MS was found in 47% and IR in 50% of the cases. Diagnosis of IR in patients without MC and marked fibrosis supported the role of HCV in the development of metabolic abnormalities. Hepatic steatosis was found in 38% of the patients and the degree of steatosis significantly correlated with that of fibrosis. Obesity, IR, steatosis and liver cirrhosis were independent negative predictors of the response to the treatment with peginterferon alpha and ribavirin.
