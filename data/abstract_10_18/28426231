Class 1 integrase intI1 has been considered as a good proxy for anthropogenic pollution because of being linked to genes conferring resistance to antibiotics. The gene cassettes of class 1 integrons could carry diverse antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and conduct horizontal gene transfer among microorganisms. The present study applied high-throughput sequencing technique combined with an intI1 database and genome assembly to quantify the abundance of intI1 in 64 environmental samples from 8 ecosystems, and to investigate the diverse arrangements of ARG-carrying gene cassettes (ACGCs) carried by class 1 integrons. The abundance of detected intI1 ranged from 3.83 x 10(-4) to 4.26 x 10 degrees intI1/cell. High correlation (Pearson's r = 0.852) between intI1 and ARG abundance indicated that intI1 could be considered as an important indicator of ARGs in environments. Aminoglycoside resistance genes were most frequently observed on gene cassettes, carried by 57% assembled ACGCs, followed by trimethoprim and beta-lactam resistance genes. This study established the pipeline for broad monitoring of intI1 in various environmental samples and scanning the ARGs carried by integrons. These findings supplemented our knowledge on the distribution of class 1 integrons and ARGs carried on mobile genetic elements, benefiting future studies on horizontal gene transfer of ARGs.
