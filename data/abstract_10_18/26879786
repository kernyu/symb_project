OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the resistance of Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori) clinical isolates to various antibiotics, in order to guide rational drug use in Hebei Province. METHODS: From January 2014 to July 2015, 260 patients with H. pylori infection who had not received eradication treatment were enrolled in Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University. Gastric mucosa biopsy tissue samples were collected from these patients before treatment for isolation and culture of H. pylori. Kirby-Bauer method was used to detect drug-resistance rate of the H. pylori clinical isolates to metronidazole, clarithromycin, amoxicillin, levofloxacin, and furazolidone. RESULTS: A total of 155 H. pylori strains were isolated from tissue samples of the 260 patients (positive rate, 59.6%). The drug-resistance rate of H. pylori isolated to metronidazole, clarithromycin, amoxicillin, levofloxacin, and furazolidone was 94.2%(146/155), 21.3%(33/155), 2.6%(4/155), 5.8% (9/155), and 1.9%(3/155), respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in positive culture rate and drug-resistance rate between different sex, age, and disease category(all P>0.05). CONCLUSION: In Hebei Province, the resistance rates of H. pylori to metronidazole and clarithromycin appear to be higher than those to amoxicillin, levofloxacin, and furazolidone.
