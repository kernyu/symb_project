Antimitotic drugs are key components of combination chemotherapy protocols for hematological and solid tumors. The taxanes (e.g., paclitaxel) bind to the beta subunit of the tubulin heterodimer and reduce microtubule dynamics, leading to cell cycle arrest in G2/M. The effectiveness of combination chemotherapy is limited by tumor resistance to drugs initially or as a cumulative effect after several cycles of treatment. Because changes in the drug receptor may be linked to drug resistance, we investigated changes in beta-tubulin isotypes in response to paclitaxel treatment in MCF7 breast cancer cells. We found that paclitaxel induced a 2-3 fold increase in mRNA for beta-tubulin IIA and III genes, TUBB2A, and TUBB3. beta-Tubulin class III protein increased; however, beta-tubulin class II protein was not detected in these cells. Paclitaxel treatment following pretreatment with actinomycin D showed that the change in beta-tubulin class III was due to increased transcription and linked to G2/M arrest. The increase in beta-tubulin IIA mRNA was due to both enhanced stability and increased transcription, unassociated with G2/M arrest. We used micro-RNA superarrays to look for changes in families of micro-RNAs that might be linked to drug-induced changes in beta-tubulin isotype mRNA and/or protein. We found a significant decrease in the tumor suppressor, miR-100, in MCF7 cells in response to paclitaxel treatment. Transfection of MCF7 cells with miR-100 significantly reduced beta-tubulin I, IIA, IIB and V mRNA and prevented paclitaxel-induced increases in beta-tubulin isotypes. This is the first report of a micro-RNA that regulates these specific beta-tubulin isotype mRNAs.
