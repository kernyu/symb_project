Recently, it was proposed that the opportunistic yeast pathogen Candida parapsilosis was a complex composed of the following three species: Candida parapsilosis sensu stricto, Candida orthopsilosis, and Candida metapsilosis. A set of 344 clinical isolates of Candida parapsilosis from Monterrey, Mexico was re-identified by RFLP. Their antifungal susceptibility to fluconazole, caspofungin, anidulafungin and micafungin was determined using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute M27-A3 protocol. Candida parapsilosis sensu stricto was the most frequent species, and was the only one which showed resistance to antifungals.
