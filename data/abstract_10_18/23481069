BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Several chemical compounds isolated from natural sources have antibacterial activity and some enhance the antibacterial activity of antibiotics reversing the natural resistance of bacteria to certain antibiotics. In this study, the hexane and methanol extract of Cordia verbenaceae were assessed for antibacterial activity alone and combinated with norfloxacin against the Staphylococcus aureus strain SA1199B. METHODS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of extracts was assayed using microdilution assay and the modulatory activity was evaluated using plate diffusion assay. RESULTS: The MIC observed varied between 256 to >1024 mug/ml. However, the antibiotic activity of norfloxacin was enhanced in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of hexane extract of C. verbenaceae (HECV). INTERPRETATIONS & CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that Cordia verbenaceae DC. can be a source of plant derived products with antibiotic modifying activity.
