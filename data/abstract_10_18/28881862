Background: The recommendation that antibiotics should be used for routine therapy of travellers' diarrhoea is being reconsidered in view of growing evidence that the therapy may lead to intestinal carriage of multi-drug resistant (MDR) colonic microbiota. This review attempts to put the issues of therapy and MDR acquisition in perspective to help in the establishment of therapeutic recommendations for travellers' diarrhoea. Methods: The existing literature showing the risk and consequences of acquisition of MDR microbiota in antibiotic-treated travellers was reviewed. Issues important to the development of firm evidence-based recommendations for antibiotics use for treatment and prevention of travellers' diarrhoea were researched. Results: Six areas of research needed to allow the development of evidence-based recommendations for antibiotic-treatment and -prevention of travellers' diarrhoea were identified. Conclusions: Increasing worldwide occurrence of antibiotic resistance should alert public health officials of the importance of encouraging local antibiotic stewardship guidelines. Six areas to research are identified in this review to allow the development of evidence-based recommendations for use of antibiotics for treatment and selective prevention of travellers' diarrhoea. An interdisciplinary ISTM Consensus group will consider the data available and develop current recommendations for therapy and chemoprevention of travellers' diarrhoea considering groups who would benefit the most from antimicrobials while recognizing the hazards associated with broad use of these drugs. With interim recommendations and ultimately evidence-based recommendations, guidelines can be developed for management of travellers' diarrhoea considering populations and destinations.
