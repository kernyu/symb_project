STAT5 fulfills essential roles in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), a prototypical stem cell malignancy. However, the specific contributions of the two related genes STAT5A and STAT5B have not been determined. In this study, we used a RNAi-based strategy to establish participation of these genes to CML disease and persistence following targeted therapy. We showed that STAT5A/STAT5B double-knockdown triggers CML cell apoptosis and suppresses both normal and CML HSC long-term clonogenic potential. STAT5A and STAT5B exhibited similar prosurvival activity, but STAT5A attenuation alone was ineffective at impairing growth of normal and CML CD34(+) cells isolated at diagnosis. In contrast, STAT5A attenuation was sufficient to enhance basal oxidative stress and DNA damage of normal CD34(+) and CML cells. Furthermore, it weakened the ability to manage exogenous oxidative stress, increased p53 (TRP53)/CHK-2 (CHEK2) stress pathway activation, and enhanced prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD)-3 (EGLN3) mRNA expression. Only STAT5A and its transactivation domain-deficient mutant STAT5ADelta749 specifically rescued these activities. STAT5A attenuation was also active at inhibiting growth of CML CD34(+) cells from patients with acquired resistance to imatinib. Our findings show that STAT5A has a selective role in contributing to stress resistance through unconventional mechanisms, offering new opportunities to eradicate the most primitive and tyrosine kinase inhibitor-resistant CML cells with an additional potential to eradicate persistent stem cell populations.
