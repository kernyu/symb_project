MRX-I is a new oxazolidinone antimicrobial under development. In this study, the potential for development of resistance to MRX-I in Staphylococcus aureus was investigated and key mutations were characterised. Determination of spontaneous resistance frequency and the mutant selection window (MSW) were performed with meticillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) ATCC 29213, meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) ATCC 33591 and two clinical MRSA isolates SA 0016 and SA 0017. Selected resistant mutants were sequenced for 23S rRNA as well as genes encoding the ribosomal proteins L3, L4 and L22. Resistance frequencies for the aforementioned strains were <8.25x10(-12), <6.33x10(-12), <2.96x10(-13) and <4.52x10(-13), respectively, and the MSW of MRX-I was 2-4, 1-4, 1-2 and 1-4 mg/L, respectively. After 30 serial passages, MRX-I minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) increased up to 8- to 16-fold both against MSSA and MRSA, whilst linezolid MICs increased 128-fold against MSSA and 16- to 32-fold against MRSA. MRX-I resistance mutations were clustered mainly in 23S rRNA and L3 protein regions. The U2504A transversion in 23S rRNA dominated in MRX-I-resistant mutants. No mutations in L4 and L22 proteins were observed. MRX-I exhibits a low potential to develop resistance in S. aureus, with a reduced resistance propensity compared with linezolid.
