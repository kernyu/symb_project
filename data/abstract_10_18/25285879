Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the major nosocomial pathogen that can causes a wide variety of acute and chronic infections P. aeruginosa is a dreaded bacteria not just because of the high intrinsic and acquired antibiotic resistance rates but also the biofilm formation and production of multiple virulence factors. We investigated the in vitro activities of antibiotics (ceftazidime, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, doripenem, piperacillin and colistin) and antimicrobial cationic peptides (AMPs; LL-37, CAMA: cecropin(1-7)-melittin A(2-9) amide, melittin, defensin and magainin-II) alone or in combination against biofilms of laboratory strain ATCC 27853 and 4 clinical strains of P. aeruginosa. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and minimum biofilm eradication concentrations (MBEC) were determined by microbroth dilution technique. The MBEC values of antibiotics and AMPs were 80->5120 and 640->640mg/L, respectively. When combined with the LL-37 or CAMA at 1/10x MBEC, the MBEC values of antibiotics that active against biofilms, were decreased up to 8-fold. All of the antibiotics, and AMPs were able to inhibit the attachment of bacteria at the 1/10x MIC and biofilm formation at 1x or 1/10x MIC concentrations. Time killing curve studies showed 3-log10 killing against biofilms in 24h with almost all studied antibiotics and AMPs. Synergism were seen in most of the studied combinations especially CAMA/LL-37+ciprofloxacin against at least one or two strains' biofilms. Since biofilms are not affected the antibiotics at therapeutic concentrations, using a combination of antimicrobial agents including AMPs, or inhibition of biofilm formation by blocking the attachment of bacteria to surfaces might be alternative methods to fight with biofilm associated infections.
