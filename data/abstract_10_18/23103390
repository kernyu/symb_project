With multidrug-resistant cases of tuberculosis increasing globally, better antibiotic drugs and novel drug targets are becoming an urgent need. Traditional beta-lactam antibiotics that inhibit D,D-transpeptidases are not effective against mycobacteria, in part because mycobacteria rely mostly on L,D-transpeptidases for biosynthesis and maintenance of their peptidoglycan layer. This reliance plays a major role in drug resistance and persistence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infections. The crystal structure at 1.7 A resolution of the Mtb L,D-transpeptidase Ldt(Mt2) containing a bound peptidoglycan fragment, reported here, provides information about catalytic site organization as well as substrate recognition by the enzyme. Based on our structural, kinetic, and calorimetric data, we propose a catalytic mechanism for Ldt(Mt2) in which both acyl-acceptor and acyl-donor substrates reach the catalytic site from the same, rather than different, entrances. Together, this information provides vital insights to facilitate development of drugs targeting this validated yet unexploited enzyme.
