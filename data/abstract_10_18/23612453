BACKGROUND: Patients with recurrent/metastatic endometrial cancer that progresses after chemotherapy have limited treatment options and poor outcomes. Preclinical data suggest the oral mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus may provide clinical benefit in these patients. METHODS: In this multicenter, open-label, phase 2 study, patients with advanced or metastatic endometrial cancer refractory to one or two previous chemotherapy regimens received everolimus 10 mg per day until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary end point was the non-progressive disease rate at 3 months. Secondary end points included duration of response, progression-free, and overall survival (OS), and safety. RESULTS: Forty-four patients were enrolled (median age, 65 years); 66% received one previous chemotherapy regimen. The 3-month non-progressive disease rate was 36% (95% confidence interval 22-52%), including two patients (5%) with partial response (PR). At 6 months, two additional patients experienced PR. Median duration of response was 3.1 months. Median progression-free and OS were 2.8 months and 8.1 months, respectively. The most common adverse events were anaemia (100%), fatigue (93%), hypercholesterolaemia (81%), and lymphopenia (81%). CONCLUSION: Everolimus demonstrated efficacy and acceptable tolerability in patients with chemotherapy-refractory advanced or metastatic endometrial cancer. These results support the further development of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-targeted therapies in endometrial cancer.
