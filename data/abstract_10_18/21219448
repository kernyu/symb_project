The emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus calls for inventive research and development strategies. Inhibition of this bacterial pathogenesis may be a promising therapeutic approach. The screening of antimicrobial compounds from endophytes is a promising way to meet the increasing threat of drug-resistant strains of human and plant pathogens. In the present study, a novel endophytic fungus, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, was isolated from the medicinal plant Vitex negundo L. Extracts of C. gloeosporioides were obtained using hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol solvents. The fungal extracts exhibited an effective antimicrobial activity against bacterial and fungal strains. The extracts were also analysed for antibacterial activity against methicillin-, penicillin- and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus strains (1-10). The methanol extract showed an effective antibacterial activity against S. aureus strain 9, with a minimal inhibitory concentration of 31.25 mug mL(-1) . The synergistic action of endophytic fungal extract with antibiotics such as methicillin, penicillin and vancomycin was observed against S. aureus strain 6. The fractional inhibitory concentration index of methanol extract with methicillin, penicillin and vancomycin was 1.0, 0.5 and 0.375, respectively. These results clearly indicate that the metabolite of endophytic fungus C. gloeosporioides is a potential source of new antibiotics.
