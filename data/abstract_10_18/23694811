Since induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have differentiation potential into all three germ layer-derived tissues, efficient purification of target cells is required in many fields of iPS research. One useful strategy is isolation of desired cells from differentiated iPS cells by lineage-specific expression of a drug-resistance gene, followed by drug selection. With this strategy, we purified neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs), a good candidate source for regenerative therapy, from differentiated mouse iPS cells. We constructed a bicistronic expression vector simultaneously expressing blasticidin S resistance gene and DsRed under the control of tandem enhancer of a 257-base pair region of nestin second intron, an NSC-specific enhancer. This construct was efficiently inserted into the iPS genome by piggyBac transposon-mediated gene transfer, and the established subclone was differentiated into NSCs in the presence or absence of blasticidin S. Consequently, incubation with blasticidin S led to purification of NSCs from differentiated iPS cells. Our results suggest that a lineage-specific drug selection strategy is useful for purification of NSCs from differentiated iPS cells and that this strategy can be applied for the purification of other cell types.
