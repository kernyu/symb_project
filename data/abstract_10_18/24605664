AIM: Characteristics of bacteriocinogenicity and bacteriocin-sensistivity of enterococci isolated from human feces. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Principle of delayed antagonism on solid nutrient mediu (120 x 120 cultures) was used for detection of bacteriocinogenicity of microorganisms. Factors of pathogenicity (production of hemolysin, gelatinase, DNase) as well as antagonism against Listeria genus bacteria were determined in highly active strains. RESULTS: Intrageneric antagonism was detected in 65% of bacterial cultures. Almost a quarter (23.1%) of bacteriocinogenic strains suppressed growth of more than 50 cultures of enterococci. This feature however was noted in members of 4 species, vast majority (77.8%) of the isolates with a wide specter of activity was attributed to Enterococcus faecium species. Under in vitro conditions these cultures displayed a pronounced anti-listeriosis effect, they did not have expression of pathogenicity factors. CONCLUSION: Higher prevalence of intra- and intergeneric antagonism in enterococci explains the significant importance of bacteria of this group of intestine microbiome in colonization resistance of host organism biotope.
