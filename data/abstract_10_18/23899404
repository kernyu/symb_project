Photodynamic therapy is usually used against malignant and non-malignant tumors. Nowadays, due to resistance of bacterial strains, we are looking for a new antimicrobial strategy to destroy bacteria with minimal invasive consequences. The worldwide increase in antibiotic resistance among different classes of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria has led to the search for alternative anti-microbial therapies such as antimicrobial PDT (aPDT). Development antimicrobial technology combines a nontoxic compound, called photosensitizer, visible light of the appropriate wavelength, and the generation of reactive oxygen species. In this work, the photosensitizers TMPyP and ZnTPPS4 are investigated for photodynamic and antimicrobial photodynamic therapy. We tested these two porphyrins on two cell lines and two bacterial strains to compare effectiveness. In addition, we applied photosensitizers bound in the complex created with hp-beta-cyclodextrin. The light-emitting diodes were used at the doses 0, 1, 5, 10 J/cm(2) for cells and 0, 150 J/cm(2) for bacteria. Tested concentrations for cells and microbes were from 0.5 to 50 muM and from 0.78 to 100 muM, respectively. From this work it can be concluded that TMPyP is a promising compound both in aPDT and in PDT, particularly in contrast to ZnTPPS4, which was efficient only in PDT. Furthermore, the eradication of gram-positive bacteria is possible only with higher concentrations of ZnTPPS4.
