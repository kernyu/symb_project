The erm(41) gene causes inducible macrolide resistance in Mycobacterium abscessus but not Mycobacterium chelonae. erm(41) sequencing of 285 M. abscessus and 45 M. chelonae isolates was compared to 14-day susceptibility; agreement percentages were 98.9% and 100%, respectively. Extended incubation may not be necessary for M. chelonae, and the erm(41) genotype is a useful adjunct for M. abscessus.
