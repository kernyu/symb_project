Antimicrobial resistance, either by mutation or acquisition of resistance determinants harbored by mobile genetic elements, may confer a biological cost for the bacteria. This biological cost can be evaluated by comparing the resistant mutant to the wild susceptible strain, in the absence of antibiotic selection. This fitness cost can affect the growth rate in vitro or the survival in the host or in the environment or the virulence capacity. Various studies have evidenced this cost, either in vitro or in vivo, in different analysis models. However, bacteria can evolve and adapt to reduce this cost, by compensatory mutations or fine regulation of resistance expression. This compensatory evolution allows resistant bacteria to persist even in the absence of antibiotic selection pressure.
