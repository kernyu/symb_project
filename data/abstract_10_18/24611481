BACKGROUND: Vascular leakage and oedema formation are key components in sepsis. In septic patients, plasma levels of the vasoconstrictive and pro-inflammatory peptide endothelin-1 (ET-1) correlate with mortality. During sepsis, neutrophils release heparin-binding protein (HBP) known to increase vascular permeability and to be a promising biomarker of human sepsis. As disruption of ET-signalling in endotoxemia attenuates formation of oedema, we hypothesized that this effect could be related to decreased levels of HBP. To investigate this, we studied the effects of ET-receptor antagonism on plasma HBP and oedema formation in a porcine model of sepsis. In addition, to further characterize a potential endothelin/HBP interaction, we investigated the effects of graded ET-receptor agonist infusions. METHODS: Sixteen anesthetized pigs were subjected to 5 h of endotoxemia and were randomized to receive either the ET-receptor antagonist tezosentan or vehicle after 2 h. Haemodynamics, gas-exchange and lung water were monitored. In separate experiments, plasma HBP was measured in eight non-endotoxemic animals exposed to graded infusion of ET-1 or sarafotoxin 6c. RESULTS: Endotoxemia increased plasma ET-1, plasma HBP, and extravascular lung water. Tezosentan-treatment markedly attenuated plasma HBP and extravascular lung water, and these parameters correlated significantly. Tezosentan decreased pulmonary vascular resistance and increased respiratory compliance. In non-endotoxemic pigs graded ET-1 and sarafotoxin 6c infusions caused a dose-dependent increase in plasma HBP. CONCLUSIONS: ET-receptor antagonism reduces porcine endotoxin-induced pulmonary oedema and plasma levels of the oedema-promoting protein HBP. Moreover, direct ET-receptor stimulation distinctively increases plasma HBP. Together, these results suggest a novel mechanism by which ET-1 contributes to formation of oedema during experimental sepsis.
