BACKGROUND: Canadian First Nation populations have experienced endemic and epidemic tuberculosis (TB) for decades. Vitamin D-mediated induction of the host defence peptide LL-37 is known to enhance control of pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate associations between serum levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) and LL-37, in adult Dene First Nation participants (N = 34) and assess correlations with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and vitamin D binding protein (VDBP). DESIGN: Venous blood was collected from all participants at baseline (winter and summer) and in conjunction with taking vitamin D supplements (1,000 IU/day) (winter and summer). Samples were analysed using ELISA for concentrations of vitamin D and LL-37, and SNPs in the VDR and VDBP regions were genotyped. RESULTS: Circulating levels of 25(OH)D were not altered by vitamin D supplementation, but LL-37 levels were significantly decreased. VDBP and VDR SNPs did not correlate with serum concentrations of 25(OH)D, but LL-37 levels significantly decreased in individuals with VDBP D432E T/G and T/T, and with VDR SNP Bsm1 T/T genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that vitamin D supplementation may not be beneficial as an intervention to boost innate immune resistance to M. tuberculosis in the Dene population.
