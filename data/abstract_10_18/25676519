The treatment of infections caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) is challenging because multidrug regimens with limited efficacy and considerable toxicity are required. Current treatment of NTM is largely empiric. None of the NTM drugs were specifically developed for the treatment of NTM; the rationale for their use was often extrapolated from the treatment of tuberculosis. This article reviews key features of the drugs that are most commonly used for NTM infections, and provides monitoring parameters. With this information, clinicians can make the most of the limited options available. Considerable research is needed to optimize the treatment of NTM.
