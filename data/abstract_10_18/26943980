With the progressive increase in life-expectancy of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients in the "highly active antiretroviral therapy" (HAART) era, co-morbidities, particularly cardiovascular (CV) diseases (CVD) are emerging as an important concern. The pathophysiology of CVD in this population is complex, due to the interaction of classical CV risk factors, viral infection and the effects of antiretroviral therapy (ARV). The role of ARV drugs in HIV is double edged. While these drugs reduce systemic inflammation, an important factor in CV development, they may at the same time be proatherogenic by inducing dyslipidemia, body fat redistribution and insulin resistance. In these patients primary prevention is challenging, considering the lower median age at which acute coronary syndromes occur. Furthermore prevention is still limited by the lack of robust evidence-based, HIV-specific recommendations. Therefore we performed a comprehensive evaluation of the literature to analyze current knowledge on CVD prevalence in HIV-infected patients, traditional and HIV-specific risk factors and risk stratification, and to summarize the recommendations for primary prevention of CVD in this HIV population.
