We evaluated the correlation of phenotypic ethambutol (EMB) susceptibility as determined by two drug susceptibility methods with embB mutations in multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. The concordance rate for EMB resistance between broth dilution method and sequencing results (83.6%) was significantly higher than between the proportion method and sequencing results (61.7%) (P = 0.004). Of the embB mutants, 75.4% (46/61) possessed a mutation at embB306. Our results demonstrated that ethambutol resistance determined by broth dilution method reveals better correlation with embB mutations than the proportion method in MDR isolates.
