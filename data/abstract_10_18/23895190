beta-lactamase-mediated resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics is an increasing threat to clinical antimicrobial chemotherapy. The combinations of beta-lactam antibiotics and beta-lactamase inhibitors (such as sulbactam, tazobactam and clavulanic acid) have been successfully used for overcoming class A beta-lactamase-mediated resistance. However, none of the inhibitors effective against class B, C or D beta-lactamases are available in the clinic, which alarms an urgent need to discover/design broad-spectrum beta-lactamase inhibitors or new beta-lactam antibiotics capable of evading bacterial enzymatic inactivation. In recent years, inhibitors targeted to serine beta-lactamases have been developed rapidly with a few of them under clinical trials. In contrast, none promising class B beta-lactamase (metallo-beta-lactamase) inhibitors with good druggability have been discovered, despite the increasing number of active molecules reported. In this review, we summarized the potential beta-lactamase inhibitors reported in recent years and updated the current status of beta-lactamase inhibitor discovery.
