OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the prevalence and susceptibility pattern of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates in patients suffering from respiratory tract infection. METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted from January to December 2014 in Northwest General Hospital and Research Centre, Peshawar. A total of 615 sputum samples were collected from both in and out-patients. Sputum samples were collected as per standard procedure and were inoculated on Blood, MacConkey and Chocolate agar. The isolates were identified by standard protocols using biochemical tests. The antibiotic susceptibility pattern of each isolate was checked as per Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines using Kirby-Bauer's disc diffusion method. RESULTS: Out of 615 sputum samples, 354 (57.56%) were culture positive. Out of these a total of 71 (20.05%) strains of Pseudomonas were isolated, where 54.93% was from males and 45.07% were from females (Mean age was 44.29 +/- 22.72:). Highest sensitivity was seen to Amikacin (92.86%) followed by Meropenem (91.55%) while lowest sensitivity was seen to Cefoperazone + Sulbactam (16.9%). There were 39.44% MDR strains, out of which 25% were Extensively Drug Resistant (XDR) and 10.71% were Pan Drug Resistant (PDR). In vitro susceptibility of MDR isolates showed highest sensitivity to Amikacin (82.14%) followed by Carbapenems (78.57%). All MDR isolates were resistant to Cefoperazone + Sulbactam. Resistance to Piperacillin + Tazobactam was 96.43%. CONCLUSION: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the commonly isolated organisms and it is becoming more resistant to commonly used antibiotics. Carbapenems and aminoglycosides were the two classes of drugs that showed highest activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
