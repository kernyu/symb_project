We report on antimicrobial activity against E. faecalis and E. faecium collected in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK between 2004 and 2009 as part of the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (UK in vitro data not included due to low isolate numbers). Overall, 1.1% (n=23/2068) of E. faecalis and 11.5% (n=103/893) of E. faecium were vancomycin-resistant. High levels of minocycline-resistant E. faecalis were reported in Germany, Spain, France, and Italy (40.2-44.2%); levofloxacin resistance was high in Germany, Italy, and Spain (31.1-41.6%). Minocycline non-susceptibility increased significantly among E. faecalis in Spain and Italy (P<0.001). No tigecycline-resistant E. faecalis were reported. Among E. faecium, resistance ranged from 72.9% (France) to 93.3% (Germany) for ampicillin, from 56.1% (France) to 90.2% (Germany) for levofloxacin, and from 75.3% (Italy) to 94.7% (Germany) for penicillin. Levofloxacin non-susceptibility increased significantly among E. faecium in France and Spain (P<0.001). The lowest rates of antimicrobial resistance among E. faecium were reported for tigecycline (2/893; 0.2%) and linezolid (3/893; 0.3%).
