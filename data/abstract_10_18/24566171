We investigated a novel Japanese isolate of sequence type 11 (ST11), the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-2 (KPC-2)-producing K. pneumoniae strain Kp3018, which was previously obtained from a patient treated at a Brazilian hospital. This strain was resistant to various antibiotic classes, including carbapenems, and harbored the gene blaKPC-2, which was present on the transferable plasmid of ca. 190 kb, in addition to the blaCTX-M-15 gene. Furthermore, the ca. 2.3-kb sequences (ISKpn8-blaKPC-2-ISKpn6-like), encompassing blaKPC-2, were found to be similar to those of K. pneumoniae strains from China.
