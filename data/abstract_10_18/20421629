Amikacin (AN) is the most active aminoglycoside for the treatment of infections caused by Acinetobacter baumannii. The VITEK 2 automated system showed false susceptibility to AN for the A. baumannii isolate harboring armA. This phenomenon was not observed in the Serratia marcescens isolate harboring armA, but was detected in its transconjugant E. coli J53.
