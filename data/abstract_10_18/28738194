The aim of this study was to examine the presence of genes responsible for resistance to quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) and the association of qac genes with class 1 integrons in Escherichia coli isolated from retail meats. Among the 179 E. coli isolates tested, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of benzalkonium chloride (BC) ranged from 4 to 64mug/mL. PCR assays indicated that QAC-resistance genes sugE(c), ydgE/ydgF, mdfA, emrE and qacEDelta1 were commonly present (40.2%-88.3%) in these isolates, but qacE, qacF, qacH and sugE(p) were less prevalent (2.2%-28.5%). Seven different gene cassette arrangements were identified in 31 intI1-positive isolates. Three types of qacH-sul3-associated non-classic integrons were observed in four isolates: dfrA12-orfF-aadA2-cmlA1-aadA1-qacH-IS440-sul3, aadA2-cmlA1-aadA1-qacH-IS440-sul3 and dfrA1-aadA1-qacH-IS440-sul3. Non-classic class 1 integrons were located on plasmids of 100-150kb in these four isolates. Our results demonstrated that the qacH-associated integrons located on 100 kb plasmids in two isolates could be transferred to an E. coli recipient, indicating the co-existence and co-dissemination of disinfectant and antimicrobial resistance genes among bacterial species.
