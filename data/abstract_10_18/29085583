OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to determine the aminoglycoside modifying enzymes (AMEs) encoded genes, tetracycline resistance genes, and the coa based typing of Staphylococcus aureus isolates in the Southwest of Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates was carried out by agar disk diffusion methods. Two sets of multiplex PCR mixture were used for detection of AME genes and tet genes. All of the isolates were typed with the coagulase gene typing method. Of the 121 isolates, 29.75% and 47.93% were resistant to at least one aminoglycosides and tetracyclines, respectively. RESULTS: The aac(6')-Ie-aph(2") was the most frequent gene (97.22%), and aph (3')-IIIa and ant (4')-Ia genes were detected in 61.11% and 11.11% of aminoglycoside resistant isolates, respectively. The tetK and tetM genes were detected in 82.75% and 56.9% of tetracycline resistant isolates, respectively. Overall 31.4% of isolates were MRSA. Totally 17 distinct coa gene RFLP patterns, numbered C1 to C17, were observed. The C5 was the most frequent coa type with 31 isolates. CONCLUSION: The aac(6')-Ie-aph(2") and aph (3')-IIIa genes were the most important genes contributing to aminoglycosides resistance, while resistance to tetracyclines was mediated by tetK and tetM genes. Interestingly all S. aureus with C5 as the most prevalent coa-type were resistant to at least one of the aminoglycoside antibiotics and tetracycline simultaneously. Moreover, 30 out of 31 isolates with this coa type were MRSA, indicating the importance of the C5 coa-type in MRSA strains and also in isolates that were resistant to aminoglycosides and tetracycline.
