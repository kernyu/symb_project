Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) has emerged as a major therapeutic challenge for small animal veterinarians over the past 10 years and continues to spread worryingly in many countries. This review focuses on the clinical aspects of MRSP infections seen in patients with skin disease and on currently available treatment options. In addition, it discusses the implications for in-contact people, other animals and the environment, because infection control strategies are likely to have a significant impact on treatment success and prevention of spread. There is currently no indication that MRSP is more virulent than meticillin-susceptible S. pseudintermedius, and reported infections have mostly been treated successfully, although possibly with a longer time to resolution than infections with more susceptible S. pseudintermedius. However, in vitro testing of MRSP isolates indicates resistance to most or all antibacterial agents licensed for use in pets. Based on susceptibility results, the most useful systemic antimicrobials may include chloramphenicol, rifampicin, amikacin, clindamycin and/or minocycline. Adverse effects of some of these medications may limit their usefulness. While in vitro susceptibility to vancomycin and linezolid is reported by some laboratories, use of these drugs in animals is strongly discouraged because of ethical considerations. Aggressive topical therapy has been effective as the only treatment in certain cases. Awareness, continued research and comprehensive management of infections are required by veterinary practitioners not only to help treat infected animals but also to limit the spread and prevent the establishment of this highly drug-resistant and zoonotic pathogen in veterinary facilities and in the community.
