The complete 284,628bp sequence of pH11, an IncHI2 plasmid, was determined through single-molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing. Harbored by a clinical Klebsiella pneumoniae strain H11, and isolated in Beijing, this plasmid contains multiple antibiotic resistance genes, including catA2, aac(6')-Ib, strB, strA, dfrA19, blaTEM-1, blaSHV-12, sul1, qacE delta 1, ereA, arr2, and aac3. The aac(6')-Ib is carried by a class I integron. Plasmid pH11 also carries several genes associated with resistance to heavy metals, such as tellurium, mercury, cobalt, zinc, nickel, copper, lead and cadmium. This plasmid exhibits numerous characteristics, including HipBA and RelBE toxin-antitoxin systems, two major transfer (Tra) regions closely related to those of Salmonella enterica serovar plasmid pRH-R27, a type II restriction modification system (EcoRII R-M system), several methyltransferases and methylases and genes encoding Hha and StpA. These characteristics suggest that pH11 may adapt to various hosts and environments. Multiple insertion sequence elements, transposases, recombinases, resolvases and integrases are scattered throughout pH11. The presence of these genes may indicate that horizontal gene transfer occurs frequently in pH11 and thus may facilitate the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance determinants. Our data suggest that pH11 is a chimera gradually assembled through the integration of different horizontally acquired DNA segments via transposition or homologous recombination.
