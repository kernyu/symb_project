In the last few years there has been an increase of implantable cardiac electronic device and vascular graft related infections. This is due in part to a higher complexity of some of these procedures and an increase in patient's comorbidities. Despite wide diagnosis methods availability, early stage diagnosis usually constitutes a challenge as often patients only denote insidious symptoms. In most confirmed cases, removal of the infected device is required to resolve the infection. This is mostly explainable because of bacterial ability to grow as biofilms on biomaterial surfaces, conferring them antimicrobial resistance. If removal is not possible, chronic suppressive antimicrobial therapy could be an option.
