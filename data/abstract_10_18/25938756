We describe the case of a young woman with an acute HIV infection characterized at onset by neurological features. The patient spontaneously controlled her HIV infection and recovered in a short period of time. The patient's clinical and virological history showed a peculiar evolution of HIV infection, with an MDR HIV-1 in CSF and a wild HIV strain in PBMCs. The patient's PBMC showed a rapid shift from a wild type to an MDR strain in few days.
