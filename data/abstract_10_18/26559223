Multidrug resistant tuberculosis is an increasing problem globally. The current gold standard in drug sensitivity testing is slow and cumbersome. To tackle drug resistance effectively, a more rapid method of testing is required. Current molecular tests are fast, but only offer information on a limited number of genetic loci. Whole genome sequencing presents an attractive alternative that can provide comprehensive, clinically relevant information on all described loci. Although the standard approach to whole genome sequencing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is slow due to the requirement of culture, this article will describe recent advances that mean it has the potential to provide results within days.
