Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease, characterized by frequent resistance to available chemotherapeutic agents. The basic therapy for patients with AML has changed little over the past 30 years. Improvements in outcome in recent decades in younger adult cohorts have generally been ascribed to better supportive care (ie, transfusion and antimicrobial therapy); older adults with AML continue to fare poorly. The explosion of new knowledge regarding the AML genome has yet to be translated into therapeutic benefit, but analysis of specific molecular features in AML samples has enabled the field to more accurately parse out prognosis and assign appropriate therapies (eg, chemotherapy vs allogeneic stem cell transplantation) for groups of patients. Cytogenetic analysis, whether by metaphase or interphase analysis, has been the main tool used to divide patients into varying prognostic subsets, but it has been modified in recent years to include assessment of mutations in a small number of genes. In the past several years, new technologies have provided strategies to interrogate individual cancer genomes in a broad and in-depth fashion. The present article discusses the potential of these new technologies, particularly gene panel and whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing, to improve diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic outcome in AML.
