BACKGROUND/AIMS: Tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate (YMDD) mutations were the main limitation of lamivudine (LAM) for treating chronic hepatitis B (CHB). The aim of this study was to evaluate whether LAM combined with IFN-alpha offer advantage over lamivudine monotherapy for the occurrence of YMDD mutations in CHB using a meta-analysis. METHODOLOGY: We searched electronic databases and calculated the odds ratios (OR) with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) and pooled the results. RESULTS: Our meta-analysis indicated that the difference of YMDD mutation rates between the combination therapy of IFN-alpha2b, IFN-alpha2a and Peg-IFN-alpha2a respectively plus LAM and LAM monotherapy (95% CI, 3.25-9.70, 95% CI, 5.77-17.51, 95% CI, 6.79-26.13, respectively). The rate of YMDD mutations in LAM monotherapy was increased when compared with combination and sequential combination group (95% CI, 6.79-22.16, and 95% CI, 2.69-7.75, respectively). The YMDD mutation rate in combination therapy was lower than that of LAM monotherapy in HBeAg positive patients (95% CI, 4.98-13.23). CONCLUSIONS: Our present meta-analysis suggests that different types of IFN-a in combination with LAM can significantly reduce the rate of YMDD mutation compared to LAM monotherapy.
