This study deals with evaluating antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of the peel of pea (Pisum sativum), with particular attention to the content of some bioactive compounds. Total content of polyphenols and flavonoids of Pisum sativum peel extracts, including a crude aqueous extract, a methanolic extract and an ethyl acetate extract was carried out according to the standard methods to assess their corresponding antioxidant activities. The organic solvents extracts antioxidant activities, determined by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay, ferric reducing (FRAP) assay and 2,2 azinobis 3-ethylbenzo-thiozoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) assay, were relatively high. The highest activity was found in ethyl acetate extract. The antimicrobial activities of extracts were also assessed. The highest MIC value was occurred with E.Coli (850 microg/ml) when using ethyl acetate extract. From the results obtained, Pisum sativum peel can be considered as a very good source of health promoting compounds.
