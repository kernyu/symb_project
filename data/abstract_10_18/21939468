In recent years there has been renewed interest in colistin for the treatment of infections by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, causing concern that increasing use may be accompanied by the emergence of resistance. This is a retrospective cohort study of colonization and infection by colistin-resistant (CR) gram-negative bacteria in critically ill patients. Colonization data were based on surveillance culture results. Among 150 patients, 78 (52%) were colonized by CR Gram-negative bacteria. Among them, 30 (20%) were colonized by Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates and 51 (34%) were colonized by intrinsically resistant to colistin (CIR) enterobacteriaceae. Seven cases of infection were caused by CR K. pneumoniae and 12 cases by CIR strains. The main risk factor for colonization by CR pathogens was colistin treatment.
