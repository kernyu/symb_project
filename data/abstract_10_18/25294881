A genome-wide susceptibility assay was used to identify specific CpxR-dependent genes that facilitate Escherichia coli resistance to a model cationic antimicrobial peptide, protamine. A total of 115 strains from the Keio Collection, each of which contained a deletion at a demonstrated or predicted CpxR/CpxA-dependent locus, were tested for protamine susceptibility. One strain that exhibited high susceptibility carried a deletion of tolC, a gene that encodes the outer membrane component of multiple tripartite multidrug transporters. Concomitantly, two of these efflux systems, AcrAB/TolC and EmrAB/TolC, play major roles in protamine resistance. Activation of the CpxR/CpxA system stimulates mar transcription, suggesting a new regulatory circuit that enhances the multidrug resistance cascade. Tripartite multidrug efflux systems contribute to bacterial resistance to protamine differently from the Tat system. DNase I footprinting analysis demonstrated that the CpxR protein binds to a sequence located in the -35 and -10 regions of mar promoter. This sequence resembles the consensus CpxR binding site, however, on the opposite strand. aroK, a CpxR-dependent gene that encodes a shikimate kinase in the tryptophan biosynthesis pathway, was also found to facilitate protamine resistance. Specific aromatic metabolites from this pathway, such as indole, can stimulate expression of well studied CpxR-dependent genes degP and cpxP, which are not components of the tripartite multidrug transporters. Thus, we propose a novel mechanism for E. coli to modulate resistance to protamine and likely other cationic antimicrobial peptides in which the CpxR/CpxA system up-regulates mar transcription in response to specific aromatic metabolites, subsequently stimulating the multidrug resistance cascade.
