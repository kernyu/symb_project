Infection is one of the major causes of death in pediatric burns in India. This work was conducted in an exclusive Children's Hospital (KKCTH) with a total of 220 beds, of which ten beds in the burn unit and two isolation beds in the 28-bed PICU are for burns patients (more than 20% TBSA burns) with sepsis. In this study, 30 burn wound swab isolates obtained from 14 pediatric burns patients (admitted to the burns ward and transferred to PICU) from November 2013 to March 2014 were investigated. Cultures were done on the first day for all patients and empirical antibiotic administration was started for those with septic burns (14 in total) with piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin. Antibiotics were changed according to antibiotic sensitivity reports. Cultures were repeated for culture positive cases on the fifth day. Further antibiotic treatment was based on this culture report. When the general condition of the patient did not respond to highlevel antibiotics, biofilm formation was suspected and evaluated as the possible cause of antibiotic resistance. For these patients, an enhanced method of wound debridement and albumin transfusions were used to improve their general condition. Microbial identification and antimicrobial sensitivity testing was done for all 30 isolates. The predominant bacteria were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter and Staphylococcus aureus. Most of the Acinetobacter and Staphylococcus aureus showed multidrug resistance. Biofilm formation was studied using the Tissue Culture Plate (TCP) method for all bacterial isolates, and results showed that most of the MDR isolates formed biofilm.
