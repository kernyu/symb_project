INTRODUCTION: bacteremia continues to be one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality despite the existence of numerous antimicrobial agents. this study aimed to provide a Malaysian perspective on paediatric community-acquired bacteraemia based on the documentation of epidemiology and antimicrobial profile of the isolated pathogens. METHOD: A retrospective study was conducted by analysing clinical details, blood cultures and antimicrobial susceptibility testing results in children between the ages of 0 to 13 years old, who were admitted to selayang Hospital over an 11-year period from 2001 until 2011. there were 222 bacteraemia cases and the median age was 11.7 months. the highest number (39%) of bacteraemia cases occurred between ages one month to one year. the three most commonly isolated aetiological agents were Staphylococcus aureus (17.1%), nontyphoidal Salmonella (16.2%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (12.6%). Almost 8% of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates were methicillin resistant, while nontyphoidal Salmonella (Nts) isolates demonstrated 18.4%, 10.5% and 2.6% resistance towards ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin respectively. All Nts isolates were sensitive to ceftriaxone. Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates showed 17.9% resistance to penicillin. skin and soft tissue infections as well as lower respiratory tract infections (63.2%) were the main foci of infections in Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia. Acute gastroenteritis (80.0%) and pneumonia (60.8%) were the main presentations of Nts and Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteraemia respectively. Overall mortality rate was 8.1%. CONCLUSION: Knowledge on the local epidemiology and antibiotic resistance pattern serves as a significant platform in improving the empiric antibiotic therapy for patients with community acquired bacteraemia.
