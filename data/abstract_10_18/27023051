AIM: We established a high-throughput multiplex genetic detection system (HMGS) for identification of Helicobacter pylori with concomitant analysis of virulence and drug resistance. MATERIALS & METHODS: Confirmed 132 H. pylori cultures from gastric biopsies were screened by 20-gene site-HMGS, sequencing and E-test. RESULTS: HMGS was highly sensitive and specific for H. pylori identification. Concordance rate between HMGS and sequencing averaged 94.5% (virulence genes) and 97.3% (resistance genes). Observed resistance rates to four mainstream antibiotics were high, except for amoxicillin. Significant association between virulence genotype and risks for specific gastrointestinal diseases was found for five genes. Metronidazole resistance in peptic ulcer patients was significantly higher. CONCLUSION: HMGS is an effective method for H. pylori identification and analysis of virulence and drug resistance.
