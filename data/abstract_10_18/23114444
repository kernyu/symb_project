Healthcare-associated infections not only affect patients in acute care hospitals but also patients in need of long-term care. As the elderly are generally most affected, the demographic change in Germany faces a range of increasing challenges in the field of infection control. The ageing process itself is accompanied by several physiological and pathological changes which may result in an increase in the risk of infectious diseases. Elderly living in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) may in addition be exposed to further risks due to their everyday life in a community, nursing care and the, to some extent, inappropriate use of antibiotics. Bacteria that have become resistant to commonly used antimicrobial agents are meanwhile prevalent in nursing homes. Caregivers often feel left alone when facing the task of achieving a balance between the need for a comfortable familiar environment and the application of infection control measures according to a resolute prevention strategy. This review aims to give an overview about the characteristics of infections among the elderly, especially with respect to long-term care.
