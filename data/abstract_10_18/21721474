This study compares the fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth before and after load cycling. Forty-two maxillary incisors were selected. In groups 1 and 2, casting post and core was used. In groups 3 and 4, Dentatus posts and composite were used, and in groups 5 and 6, FRC posts were used. The load cycling had no statistically significant effect on fracture strength among groups.
