The present study aimed to explore the changes in serum endostatin and fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF-19) in acute myeloid leukemia patients, and to determine their effects on chemotherapeutic sensitivity. Sixty acute myeloid leukemia patients and 30 healthy controls were included in the study. Patient serum endostatin and FGF-19 levels were measured on admission, and then, standard chemotherapy was administered. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to chemotherapeutic effects: 21 patients in the chemotherapeutic sensitivity group (complete remission + partial remission) and 39 in the chemotherapeutic resistance group (no remission + degradation). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to analyze the relationship of serum endostatin and FGF-19 levels with chemotherapeutic sensitivity in acute myeloid leukemia patients. The levels of serum endostatin and FGF-19 in acute myeloid leukemia patients before chemotherapy were significantly higher than those in the control group. Moreover, these levels significantly decreased after chemotherapy (P < 0.01). The levels of serum endostatin and FGF-19 in the chemotherapeutic sensitivity group were lower than those in the chemotherapeutic resistance group, both before and after chemotherapy (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). ROC curve analysis showed that the predictive values of endostatin and FGF-19 were good, and there was no significant difference between these results. In conclusion, serum endostatin and FGF-19 can be used as predictors of chemotherapeutic sensitivity for acute myeloid leukemia patients, and may be important for determining prognosis.
