Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by the presence of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase protein, which confers resistance to apoptosis in leukemic cells. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are effectively used to treat CML; however, CML patients in the advanced (CML-AP) and chronic (CML-CP) phases of the disease are usually resistant to TKI therapy. Thus, it is necessary to seek for novel agents to treat CML, such as the enzyme l-amino acid oxidase from Calloselasma rhodostoma (CR-LAAO) snake venom. We examined the antitumor effect of CR-LAAO in Bcr-Abl(+) cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy subjects and CML patients. CR-LAAO was more cytotoxic towards Bcr-Abl(+) cell lines than towards healthy subjects' PBMC. The H2O2 produced during the enzymatic action of CR-LAAO mediated its cytotoxic effect. The CR-LAAO induced apoptosis in Bcr-Abl(+) cells, as detected by caspases 3, 8, and 9 activation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and DNA damage. CR-LAAO elicited apoptosis in PBMC from CML-CP patients without TKI treatment more strongly than in PBMC from healthy subjects and TKI-treated CML-CP and CML-AP patients. The antitumor effect of CR-LAAO against Bcr-Abl(+) cells makes this toxin a promising candidate to CML therapy.
