BACKGROUND/AIM: Helicobacter pylori is an important pathogen for gastroduodenal diseases. Infection with H. pylori can be limited by regimens of multiple antimicrobial agents. However, antibiotic resistance is a leading cause of treatment failure. The aim of this study has been to determine the resistance patterns of H. pylori strains isolated from gastric biopsies of patients with dyspepsia by agar dilution method, in Tehran, Iran. PATIENTS AND METHODS: H. pylori isolates from patients with gastrointestinal diseases were evaluated for susceptibility testing by agar dilution method. Susceptibility testing was performed to commonly used antibiotics including clarithromycin, tetracycline, amoxicillin, metronidazole and ciprofloxacin. RESULTS: Among 92 patients with dyspepsia, H. pylori strains were isolated from 42 patients. Seventeen (40.5%) of the isolates were resistant to metronidazole (MICs >/= 8 mug/l), whereas one isolate (2.4%) was resistant to amoxicillin (MICs </= 0. 5 mug/ml) and ciprofloxacin (MICs </= 1mug/ml). The resistance rates to other antibiotics in H. pylori isolates are recorded as follows: clarithromycin 6 (14.3 %), tetracycline 2 (4.8%). In 5 of 42 resistant cases, combined resistance was found. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that metronidazole should be used among Iranian patients in first-line therapy with caution, and ciprofloxacin in association with amoxicillin and a proton pump inhibitor is more recommended.
