INTRODUCTION: Approximately 130 - 150 million people have chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and upwards of 500,000 deaths annually are attributed to HCV related liver disease worldwide. Pegylated interferon and ribavirin have been the mainstay of treatment for greater than 25 years until recent advent of protease inhibitors which has led to all oral HCV treatment regimens that have changed the outlook of hepatitis C treatment. AREAS COVERED: This review provides summary of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy and safety of grazoprevir/elbasvir therapy for treatment of HCV infection. EXPERT OPINION: Grazoprevir/elbasvir provides an all-oral once daily treatment option for HCV infection with high rates of efficacy and tolerability in a pangenotypic fashion. It highly efficacious in treating patients with cirrhosis, patients who have previously failed treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin, and patients with HIV co-infection. Grazoprevir/elbasvir has demonstrated higher barrier to resistance even in the presence of variants associated with resistance such as Q41R, F43S, R155K, V36M, T54S, and D168. It is one of only few HCV treatment regimens evaluated for use in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease and dialysis. It is a very promising regimen for treatment of HCV infection.
