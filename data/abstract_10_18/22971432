This article contains our comments on the practical guideline for treating chronic hepatitis B in the Netherlands, which was published in 2008. Revision of this guideline had already become necessary in 2011 due to rapidly changing therapeutic strategies. New second-generation drugs show minimal antiviral resistance and their use should be considered more frequently. In addition, certified multidisciplinary centres of expertise should contribute to the improvement of care for patients with chronic hepatitis B. Our opinion is that the revisions make the guideline for treating chronic hepatitis B more complete and up to date.
