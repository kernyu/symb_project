OBJECTIVES: The aim of this in vitro study was to analyze the effect of the incorporation of two anti-caries agents into dental adhesives on the reduction of the virulence of Streptococcus mutans and on the adhesion to dentin. METHODS: Apigenin (1mM) and tt-Farnesol (5mM) were added separately and in combination to a self-etch adhesive (CS3 - Clearfil S3 Bond Plus) and to an each-and-rinse adhesive (OPT - OptiBond S). Biofilm of S. mutans was grown on adhesive-coated hydroxyapatite disks for 115h and bacterial viability, dry-weight, alkali soluble, water soluble, intracellular polysaccharides and protein were quantified. Bond strength and dentin-adhesive interface were performed to analyze the effects of the incorporation on the physical properties and to identify changes in hybrid layer morphology. RESULTS: Addition of Apigenin and Apigenin+tt-Farnesol to CS3, and Apigenin or tt-Farnesol to OPT reduced the dry-weight of S. mutans biofilm. Insoluble polysaccharide decreased with the addition of Apigenin to CS3 and tt-Farnesol to OPT. Intracellular polysaccharide decreased with addition of Apigenin and Apigenin+tt-Farnesol to CS3. No changes in dentin bond strength, resin-dentin interfacial morphology, total amount of protein and soluble polysaccharide were observed with the additions. SIGNIFICANCE: Biofilms that are less cariogenic around dental restorations could decrease secondary caries formation; in addition, the reduction of virulence of S. mutans without necessarily killing the microorganism is more unlikely to induce antimicrobial resistance.
