A total 14 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa that produced VEB-1 and were susceptible only to polymyxin B were recovered from hospitalized patients. VEB-1 was located within variable regions of the class 1 integron, flanked by resistant genes, and was horizontally transferable as well as carried within the IncP-type plasmid. We conclude that the IncP-type plasmid is responsible for the horizontal transmission of VEB-1-mediated expanded-spectrum cephalosporin resistance in this medical center.
