The present research was undertaken to study the probiotic characteristics of Pichia kudriavzevii isolated from frozen idli batter. Polymerase chain reaction amplification with 18S rRNA primers confirmed Pichia kudriavzevii, a xylose-utilizing probiotic strain. It was resistant to physiological concentrations of bile salts, pepsin and pancreatic enzyme. It also showed efficient auto-aggregation as well as co-aggregation ability with four commercial probiotic yeasts and exhibited good hydrophobicity in xylene and toluene. The strain inhibited the growth of 13 enteropathogens and showed a commensal relationship with four commercial probiotic yeast and bacteria. Moreover, it was resistant to 30 antibiotics with different modes of action. The yeast exhibited thermotolerance up to 95 degrees C for 2 h. The cell-free supernatants were also found to be heat stable, indicating the presence of thermostable secondary metabolites. Hence it could be exploited as starter culture, co-culture or probiotic in the preparation of fermented products or incorporated in heatable foods as well. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
