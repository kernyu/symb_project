The emergence of "superbugs" like carbapenem resistant Enterobactericiae with a NDM1 resistance pattern is a serious situation in clinical facilities in present times. The risk of health care-associated infections (HCAI) in emerging countries is two to 20 times higher than in developed countries; in some countries, the proportion can exceed 25% (1). Hospital infection prevention and control is fundamental to improving care, reducing the emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms and ensuring safety. In India constant efforts are taking place in this direction. The Clinical Infectious Diseases Society of India, along with other clinical societies, has come up with the Chennai Declaration in 2012. This has been adopted by Indian Government Health Departments and necessary steps for curtailing indiscriminate antibiotic use have also been taken. Also, it is extending the concept of antimicrobial stewardship to the community. Some novel ideas tried at Columbia Asia Hospitals in India to improve hospital infection control programmes are shared in this article.
