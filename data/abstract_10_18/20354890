We compared rifabutin susceptibility and rpoB mutations in 98 multi-drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) by DNA sequencing and with a line probe assay using the commercially available INNO-LiPA Rif. TB kit (the LiPA). Our results indicated that rifabutin continues to remain active against MDR-TB strains harboring certain genetic alterations and also that the LiPA might be useful in identifying MDR-TB strains susceptible to rifabutin.
