Rational position of voriconazole in the treatment of oncologic inpatients was shown and the criteria of its use in the algorithms of the therapy and prophylaxis of nosocomial fungal infections were developed. The clinical trial enrolled 50 patients with oncologic pathologies. The patients were divided into two groups of possible invasive candidiasis risk. The patients of one group were treated with fluconazole (Diflucan) and those of the other group were treated with voriconazole (Vifend). The spectrum of the hospital fungal flora was determined and susceptibility of 310 clinically important opportunistic fungi was investigated. All the isolates of Candida albicans and C.tropicalis were susceptible to amphotericin B, fluconazole and voriconazole and 79 and 50% of the isolates were susceptible to intraconazole respectively. As for the C.krusei isolates, 67% was susceptible to amphotericin B, 50% was susceptible to fluconazole, 100% was susceptible to voriconazole and none of the strains was susceptible to intraconazole. By the clinical efficacy voriconazole was superior to fluconazole and comparable with amphotericin B, while superior to it by the number of the side effects and by the cost of the treatment course. It was concluded that voriconazole should be considered as the main agent in the antifungal therapy of oncologic patients.
