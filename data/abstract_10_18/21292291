India contributes greatly to the global incidence of malaria. The factors influencing malaria in India are highly diverse and vary greatly from the epidemiological setting of any other country. Central India is the most vulnerable area to malaria in India. This study was carried out in three community health centres in Dindori District, Madhya Pradesh (Central India). Dindori District is mesoendemic for malaria, with both Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax being present in all age groups. Anopheles culicifacies and A. fluviatilis are highly efficient vectors of malaria. In this study, an epidemic of malaria among indigenous ethnic group Baigas was investigated to determine the causes of the epidemic and the population involved in order to aid in disease containment. The existence of sporozoite-positive A. culicifacies and A. fluviatilis indicates either that spraying had not been done properly or the presence of insecticide resistance. A combination of factors propagated the epidemic. Evidence suggests that the non-availability of artemisinin-based combination therapy and rapid diagnostic tests along with an immunogenically vulnerable population each played an important role. As the global prevalence of malaria decreases owing to initiatives to control or eliminate the disease, more areas will become mesoendemic or hypoendemic for malaria. Detection and control of epidemics requires greater attention, and mechanisms to ensure the quality of interventions are essential.
