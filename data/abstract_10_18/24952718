Two commercial methods, the Etest and Vitek 2, were compared with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute broth microdilution method to determine the susceptibility of Candida parapsilosis complex to amphotericin B, caspofungin, fluconazole, voriconazole, and itraconazole. One-hundred bloodstream isolates of C. parapsilosis complex from three hospitals in Rio de Janeiro city, Brazil, between 1998 and 2006 were analyzed. C. parapsilosis sensu stricto (61 %) was the predominant species, followed by C. orthopsilosis (37 %) and C. metapsilosis (2 %). Most isolates were susceptible to the tested drugs. However, one C. parapsilosis sensu stricto isolate was considered resistant for amphotericin B. The essential agreement was 100 % between the methods, except for itraconazole (96.3 %). The categorical agreement varied for fluconazole and itraconazole by Etest and for amphotericin B and fluconazole by Vitek 2. This study reinforces the suitability of the commercial methods in routine clinical microbiology laboratories for antifungal susceptibility testing.
