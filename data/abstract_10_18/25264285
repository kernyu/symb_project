In this study, we report the antimicrobial planktonic and biofilm kill kinetics of ultrashort cationic lipopeptides previously demonstrated by our group to have a minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) in the microgram per mL (mug/mL) range against clinically relevant biofilm-forming micro-organisms. We compare the rate of kill for the most potent of these lipopeptides, dodecanoic (lauric) acid-conjugated C12 -Orn-Orn-Trp-Trp-NH2 against the tetrapeptide amide H-Orn-Orn-Trp-Trp-NH2 motif and the amphibian peptide Maximin-4 via a modification of the MBEC Assay() for Physiology & Genetics (P&G). Improved antimicrobial activity is achieved upon N-terminal lipidation of the tetrapeptide amide. Increased antimicrobial potency was demonstrated against both planktonic and biofilm forms of Gram-positive micro-organisms. We hypothesize rapid kill to be achieved by targeting of microbial membranes. Complete kill against established 24-h Gram-positive biofilms occurred within 4 h of exposure to C12 -OOWW-NH2 at MBEC values [methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 35984): 15.63 mug/mL] close to the values for the planktonic minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) [methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 35984): 1.95 mug/mL]. Such rapid kill, especially against sessile biofilm forms, is indicative of a reduction in the likelihood of resistant strains developing with the potential for quicker resolution of pathogenic infection. Ultrashort antimicrobial lipopeptides have high potential as antimicrobial therapy.
