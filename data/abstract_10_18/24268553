Bacterial persister cells are a small population of dormant cells that are tolerant to essentially all antibiotics. Recently, we reported that a quorum sensing (QS) inhibitor, (Z)-4-bromo-5-(bromomethylene)-3-methylfuran-2(5H)-one (BF8), can revert antibiotic tolerance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa persister cells. To better understand this phenomenon, several synthetic brominated furanones with similar structures were compared for their activities in persister control and inhibition of acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) mediated QS. The results show that some other furanones in addition to BF8 are also AHL QS inhibitors and can revert antibiotic tolerance of P. aeruginosa PAO1 persister cells. However, not all QS inhibiting BFs can revert persistence at growth non-inhibitory concentrations, suggesting that QS inhibition itself is not sufficient for persister control.
