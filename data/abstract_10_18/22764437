Nosocomial infections are a significant problem and hospitals need to be aware of their nosocomial infection status. This retrospective study aimed to identify nosocomial bacterial infections in patients admitted to the Lebanese Hospital Center from January 2006 to January 2008 and determine the causative micro-organisms, the antibiotic sensitivity of the micro-organisms and evaluate the hospital treatment. In total 96 patients with nosocomial infection were included. Urinary infections were the commonest nosocomial infections (42%) followed by pulmonary infections (28%). Gram-negative bacteria were responsible for 89% of nosocomial infections and staphylococci for 7%, with Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa being the most common (46% and 26% respectively). The organisms were resistant to multiples antibiotics and 18% of the patients were treated with imipenem, 7% with vancomycin, 42% with third-generation cephalosporins and 24% with amikacin. Hospital hygiene measures and antibiotic prescription policies are required to fight nosocomial infections and reduce antibiotic resistance among organisms.
