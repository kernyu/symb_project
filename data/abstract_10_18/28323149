Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen, enable of causing infections especially in immunocompromised patients. Recently many isolates developed multiple drug resistance, resulting in treatment failure in serious infections. In this study, the effect of tobramycin incorporated with bismuth-ethanedithiol loaded on niosomes on the quorum sensing and biofilm production by P. aeruginosa was evaluated. Thin layer hydration method with cholesterol (30%), Span 40 and Tween 40 were used to make niosomes. The physical properties and particle size of the niosomes were investigated. Micro dilution method was used to determine the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) for tobramycin, niosomal tobramycin, bismuth ethanedithiol, niosomal bismuth ethanedithiol, tobramycin incorporated with bismuth-ethanedithiol and niosomal tobramycin incorporated with bismuth-ethanedithiol. Biofilm formation was evaluated using microtiter plate. The effect of different combination on N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) production was evaluated in presence of Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain (GV3101). The best combination inhibiting the growth of various strains of P. aeruginosa were niosomal tobramycin and niosomal tobramycin incorporated with bismuth-ethanedithiol which reduced the MIC of tobramycin significantly. Sub-MIC concentration of these compounds reduced the rate of biofilm formation 80% lower than the untreated bacteria, and effectively inhibited the production of AHL molecule. The prepared formulations containing non-ionic surfactants, can kept the drug and gradually release it. Encapsulation of tobramycin in combination with bismuth-ethanedithiol in niosome had the ability to reduce the MIC of tobramycin and effectively inhibiting the biofilm formation. These combinations can be used as an excellent combination for further evaluation for treatment of infections caused by MDR isolates of P. aeruginosa.
