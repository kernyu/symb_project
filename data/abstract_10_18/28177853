This study was designed and conducted to evaluate the frequency, antimicrobial resistance, and presence of six virulence-associated genes among thermophilic Campylobacters isolated from raw milk, poultry (chicken, turkey, and duck), fish, cattle, and sheep meat. Out of 590 samples, which were recovered from different origins, 141 (23.9%) samples were positive for Campylobacters. Campylobacter spp. was isolated in 40.8% (106/260), 14% (28/200), and 8.7% (7/80) of poultry meat, red meat, and milk samples, respectively. Antimicrobial susceptibility test indicated a high frequency of resistance to ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, and nalidixic acid among the isolates. Furthermore, prevalence of waaC, ciaB, and pldA genes were 91.7%, 86.7%, and 80.8%, respectively; and, none of the isolates harbored both wlaN and cgtB genes, simultaneously. Moreover, there was a weak correlation between antibiotics resistance and presence of the pathogen genes. However, the existence of Campylobacter spp. isolates in food animal products, with high resistance to antibiotics and several virulence gene possessions, is alarming and increases the attention to the widespread use of antibiotics.
