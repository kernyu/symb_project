Because of the increasing resistance of malaria parasites to antimalarial drugs, the lack of highly effective vaccines, and an inadequate control of mosquito vectors, the problem is growing, especially in the developing world. New approaches to drug development are consequently required. One of the proteases involved in the degradation of human hemoglobin is named falcipain-2 (FP2), which has emerged as a promising target for the development of novel antimalarial drugs. However, very little is known about the inhibition of FP2. In this paper, the inhibition of FP2 by the epoxysuccinate E64 has been studied by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using hybrid AM1d/MM and M06-2X/MM potentials to obtain a complete picture of the possible free energy reaction paths. A thorough analysis of the reaction mechanism has been conducted to understand the inhibition of FP2 by E64. According to our results, the irreversible attack of Cys42 on E64 can take place on both carbon atoms of the epoxy ring because both processes present similar barriers. While the attack on the C2 atom presents a slightly smaller barrier (12.3 vs 13.6 kcal mol(-1)), the inhibitor-protein complex derived from the attack on C3 appears to be much more stabilized. In contrast to previous hypotheses, our results suggest that residues such as Gln171, Asp170, Gln36, Trp43, Asn81, and even His174 would be anchoring the inhibitor in a proper orientation for the reaction to take place. These results may be useful for the rational design of new compounds with higher inhibitory activity.
