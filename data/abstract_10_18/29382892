Surface carbohydrate moieties are essential for bacterial communication, phage-bacteria and host-pathogen interaction. Most Staphylococcus aureus produce polyribitolphosphate type Wall teichoic acids (WTAs) substituted with alpha- and/or beta-O-linked N-acetyl-glucosamine (alpha-/beta-O-GlcNAc) residues. GlcNAc modifications have attracted particular interest, as they were shown to govern staphylococcal adhesion to host cells, to promote phage susceptibility conferring beta-lactam resistance and are an important target for antimicrobial agents and vaccines. However, there is a lack of rapid, reliable, and convenient methods to detect and quantify these sugar residues. Whole cell Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy could meet these demands and was employed to analyse WTAs and WTA glycosylation in S. aureus. Using S. aureus mutants, we found that a complete loss of WTA expression resulted in strong FTIR spectral perturbations mainly related to carbohydrates and phosphorus-containing molecules. We could demonstrate that alpha- or beta-O-GlcNAc WTA substituents can be clearly differentiated by chemometrically assisted FTIR spectroscopy. Our results suggest that whole cell FTIR spectroscopy represents a powerful and reliable method for large scale analysis of WTA glycosylation, thus opening up a complete new range of options for deciphering the staphylococcal pathogenesis related glycocode.
