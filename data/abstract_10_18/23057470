Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as an important cause of community-acquired infection. To characterize the microbiological and genotypic features of community-associated Acinetobacter baumannii, 32 isolates associated with community-acquired pneumonia were collected. These isolates were diverse in resistance patterns and had multiple clonal origins. bla(OXA-23) was the main acquired oxacillinases-encoding gene detected.
