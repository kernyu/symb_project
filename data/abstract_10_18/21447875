We report the case of an integrase strand-transfer inhibitor (INI)-resistant and four-drug-class-resistant HIV-1 variant infecting an antiretroviral therapy-naive man. The virus harboured INI drug resistance substitutions (Q148H and G140S) along with multiple reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitor resistance mutations. This case illustrates an emerging need to consider the possibility of acquired INI resistance among newly diagnosed treatment-naive individuals harbouring multidrug-resistant HIV-1.
