The biofilm phenotype of Aspergillus species is an important and accepted clinical entity. While industrially these biofilms have been used extensively in important biofermentations, their role in clinical infection is less well defined. A recent flurry of activity has demonstrated that these interesting filamentous moulds have the capacity to form biofilms both in vitro and in vivo, and through various investigations have shown that these are exquisitely resistant to antifungal therapies through a range of adaptive resistance mechanisms independent of defined genetic changes. This review will explore the clinical importance of these biofilms and provide contemporary information with respect to their clinical management.
