We conducted a retrospective study on the prevalence and correlates of transmitted drug resistance among newly-diagnosed antiretroviral naive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients in Northern Greece, during the period 2009-11. Transmitted drug resistance was documented in 21.8% of patients enrolled, affecting approximately 40% of subtype A HIV-1-infected individuals. Overcoming challenges due to the ongoing financial crisis, effective preventive measures should be implemented to control further dissemination of resistant HIV strains.
