The mechanism of action of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin is poorly understood and why certain mTORC1 phosphorylation sites are rapamycin insensitive remains elusive. Site-specific analysis of mTORC1 substrates now suggests that the sequence composition of a phosphorylation site determines whether it is sensitive to rapamycin and starvation.
