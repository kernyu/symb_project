PURPOSE: This study was designed to investigate the effects of repeat bolus absolute ethanol injections on cardiopulmonary hemodynamic changes during ethanol embolotherapy of inoperable congenital arteriovenous (AV) malformations in the extremities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty adult patients (14 male, 16 female; age range, 22-51 years) who underwent ethanol embolotherapy of extremity AV malformations were enrolled in the study. A pulmonary artery catheter was used to measure hemodynamic profiles at baseline (T(baseline)), immediately before (T(pre)) and after (T(post)) a bolus injection of absolute ethanol, at the time of the maximum mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) value during a session (T(highest)), 10 minutes after the final injection (T(final)), and after restoration of spontaneous breathing (T(resp)). RESULTS: The systolic, mean, and diastolic PAP (P < .01, P < .01, and P < .01, respectively) and the systemic vascular resistance index (P < .05) and pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI; P < .05) of T(highest) and T(resp) were significantly higher than values for T(final). The volume of a single bolus injection of absolute ethanol from 0.023 to 0.175 mL/kg of body weight showed that the systolic PAP (P = .02), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (P = .02), and PVRI (P < .01) significantly increased in accordance with the increased single volume of absolute ethanol. A significant increase of the right ventricular end-diastolic volume index and right ventricular end-systolic volume index were observed at a dose of more than 0.14 mL/kg of body weight for a single bolus injection of absolute ethanol. CONCLUSIONS: During ethanol embolotherapy of extremity AV malformations, significant hemodynamic changes can arise during a bolus injection of absolute ethanol. Cardiopulmonary hemodynamic profiles should be monitored closely after a bolus injection of more than 0.14 mL/kg of body weight of absolute ethanol.
