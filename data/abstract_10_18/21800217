The rapid detection of carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae could assist in the management of pneumococcal infection, such as acute otitis media. We evaluated the reliability of the Binax NOW test in the exclusion and detection of pneumococcal carriage by nasal samples from 139 children and using nasopharyngeal samples from 250 children (aged 6-35 months) with respiratory infection with or without acute otitis media. The Binax NOW test results were compared with culture-based detection of carriage of S. pneumoniae. The Binax NOW test from the nasal samples had a sensitivity of 95%, a specificity of 78%, and the positive and negative predictive values were 83 and 93%, respectively; and for the nasopharyngeal samples the corresponding numbers were 88%, 95%, 96%, and 87%. When rapid knowledge of the carriage status of S. pneumoniae is needed, the Binax NOW test is a reliable method for the exclusion of carriage using nasal sampling, and in the detection of carriage using nasopharyngeal sampling.
