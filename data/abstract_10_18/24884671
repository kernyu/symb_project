BACKGROUND: Peptides derived from the C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR) of HIV-1 gp41 such as T20 (Enfuvirtide) and C34 are potent viral fusion inhibitors. We have recently found that two N-terminal residues (Met115 and Thr116) of CHR peptides form a unique M-T hook structure that can greatly enhance the binding and anti-HIV activity of inhibitors. Here, we applied two M-T hook residues to optimize SC29EK, an electrostatically constrained peptide inhibitor with a potent anti-HIV activity. RESULTS: The resulting peptide MT-SC29EK showed a dramatically increased binding affinity and could block the six-helical bundle (6-HB) formation more efficiently. As expected, MT-SC29EK potently inhibited HIV-1 entry and infection, especially against those T20- and SC29EK-resistant HIV-1 variants. More importantly, MT-SC29EK and its short form (MT-SC22EK) suffered from the difficulty to induce HIV-1 resistance during the in vitro selection, suggesting their high genetic barriers to the development of resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies have verified the M-T hook structure as a vital strategy to design novel HIV-1 fusion inhibitors and offered an ideal candidate for clinical development.
