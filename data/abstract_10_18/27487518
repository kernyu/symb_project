Ostriches are bred especially for their high-quality meat. There is a lack of knowledge concerning the ostrich's microflora. Escherichia coli is a commensal microorganism of the poultry intestine, ostriches included. However, some strains may become pathogenic. This study was therefore undertaken to detect coliform bacteria in ostrich faeces and to test their antibiotic profile and sensitivity to enterocins. Faeces (n=54, 18 mixture samples from 3 different age groups of 140 ostriches) were sampled to isolate coliform bacteria. The counts of coliform bacteria varied from 5.69 +/- 2.4 log10 CFU/g to 5.73 +/- 2.4 CFU/g. Pure colonies were identified using MALDI-TOF MS mass spectrometry and confirmed by phenotypization. Seventy-one strains were allotted to the species E. coli. Sixty-four of those 71 strains caused hemolysis. They were mostly polyresistant to antibiotics. Thirty-two poly-resistant strains of E. coli were sensitive to enterocins. These strains were most sensitive to Ent 9296 (26 strains). Moreover, Ent EM41 produced by E. faecium EM41 (isolated from ostrich faeces) inhibited the growth of 20 strains, reaching activity of 100 AU/ml. Our results indicate the possibility of enterocins being used for prevention/reduction of coliforms. Of course, in vivo studies are also being processed.
