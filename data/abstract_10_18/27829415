BACKGROUND: Mutant prevention concentration (MPC) is an alternative pharmacodynamic parameter that has been used to measure antimicrobial activity and represents the propensities of antimicrobial agents to select resistant mutants. The concentration range between minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and MPC is defined as mutant selection window (MSW). The MPC and MSW parameters represent the ability of antimicrobial agents to inhibit the bacterial mutants selected. This study was conducted to determine the MIC and MPC values of four antimicrobials including ceftiofur, cefquinome, florfenicol and tilmicosin against 105 Riemerella anatipestifer isolates. RESULTS: The MIC50/MIC90 values of clinical isolates tested in our study for ceftiofur, cefquinome, florfenicol and tilmicosin were 0.063/0.50.031/0.51/41/4 mug/mL, respectively; MPC50/ MPC90 values were 4/648/644/3216/256 mug/mL, respectively. These results provided information on the use of these compounds in treating the R. anatipestifer infection; however, additional studies are needed to demonstrate their therapeutic efficacy. CONCLUSION: Based on the MSW theory, the hierarchy of these tested antimicrobial agents with respect to selecting resistant subpopulations was as follows: cefquinome > ceftiofur > tilmicosin > florfenicol. Cefquinome was the drug that presented the highest risk of selecting resistant mutant among the four antimicrobial agents.
