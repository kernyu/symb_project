BACKGROUND: Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a frequent pathogen of humans and many animal species, and has become established as a veterinary pathogen. CASE REPORT: In this case report we describe an MRSA infection in a dwarf rabbit, treatment of the infection and, subsequently, the genetic analysis of the isolated strain. The pet rabbit was presented to an animal hospital due to recurrent swellings on the head and on the neck. Bacteriological examination yielded Staphylococcus aureus, which was resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. The isolate was confirmed as an MRSA by mecA PCR, Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) negative, and typed as multilocus sequence type (ST)398/staphylococcal protein A (spa) type t011/staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type SCCmecIVa. The rabbit was treated with rifampicin for 2 weeks. After 2.5 weeks the rabbit was clinically normal and control swabs were negative for MRSA. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: This study is the first to report MRSA in a rabbit in Austria. This study contributes to the growing evidence that MRSA ST398 could be isolated from a variety of animals.
