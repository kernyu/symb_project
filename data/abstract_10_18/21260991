The paper presents the data of an investigation of the genetic polymorphism of the pol gene encoding viral integrase (IN) in a HIV subtype A infected population in the Lipetsk Region. The investigators analyzed 32 virus subtype A samples obtained in 2002-2007. Polymorphism at the codons associated with IN resistance to chemicals was observed in 7 virus variants. The found substitutions had a pattern of genetic polymorphism and were unassociated with resistance in 6 patients with the test subtype A population. At the same time, minor RAL resistance mutation was revealed in 1 (3.1%) virus variant while the similar mutations in the subtype G population were about 10%.
