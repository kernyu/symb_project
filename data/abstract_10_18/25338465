The new vibrio-static niclosamide (CAS No 50-65-7) is revealed. The vibrio-static test with niclosamide (10 mkg/disc) to identify bacteria of genus Vibrio is developed. This test by its diagnostic sensitivity surpasses the vibrio-static test with vibrio-static O129 since it suppresses growth of vibrios having cross resistance to O129 and co-trimoxazole. The vibrio-static test with niclosamide made it possible to identify all examined strains of V. metschnikovii, V. vulnificus, V. parahaemolyticus, V. cholerae non O1/non O139.
