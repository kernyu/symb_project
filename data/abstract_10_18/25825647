BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most prevalent infectious diseases. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), as the most important cause of UTI, are associated with a number of virulence factors. OBJECTIVES: The current study aimed to investigate the virulence associated determinants as well as their patterns of antibiotic resistance in UPEC isolated from hospitalized patients with UTI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 150 E. coli isolates were collected from patients with UTI from December 2012 to June 2013 in Kashan, Iran. Antimicrobial susceptibility screening of 12 antibiotics was determined using disk diffusion method. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay was used to detect virulence-related genes in UPEC strains. The purified PCR products were sequenced. RESULTS: Of the total 150 UPEC isolates, 111 (74%) were multidrug-resistant. High resistance was observed against ampicillin (81.3%), nalidixic acid (71.3%), cotrimoxazole (64.7%) and ciprofloxacin (61.3%), respectively. Eighty-four out of the 150 isolates showed resistance against the extended spectrum cephalosporins. Totally, virulence genes were detected in 126 (84%) UPEC isolates .The PCR results identified the traT gene in (74%), PAIs markers in (61.3%) and the pap gene in (16.6%) of the isolates. CONCLUSIONS: The traT gene and PAI markers were highly prevalent among UPEC strains isolated from patients in Kashan, Iran; therefore these determinants could be used as targets for prophylactic interventions. Also there was a high level of resistance against the antibiotics commonly used for urinary tract infection treatment. To reach better therapeutic outcomes, treatment regimens have to be modified.
