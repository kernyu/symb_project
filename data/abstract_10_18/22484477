Mutations in the RNA polymerase beta-subunit gene rpoB causing resistance to rifampicin (Rif(R)) in Bacillus subtilis were previously shown to lead to alterations in the expression of a number of global phenotypes known to be under transcriptional control. To better understand the influence of rpoB mutations on sporulation and spore resistance to heat and chemicals, cells and spores of the wild-type and twelve distinct congenic Rif(R) mutant strains of B. subtilis were tested. Different levels of glucose catabolite repression during sporulation and spore resistance to heat and chemicals were observed in the Rif(R) mutants, indicating the important role played by the RNA polymerase beta-subunit, not only in the catalytic aspect of transcription, but also in the initiation of sporulation and in the spore resistance properties of B. subtilis.
