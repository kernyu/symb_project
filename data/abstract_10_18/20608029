69 patients with metabolic syndrome (MS) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) have been examined. It is certain that activation of the cytokines system plays important part in formation of the insulin resistance syndrome. The results of our studies testify that insulin resistance in patients with MS and type 2 DM is associated by the decrease in the level of adiponectin and increase in the level of resistin. Lower level of adiponectin and higher level of resistin in blood serum can be examined as markers of the metabolic syndrome. Content of adiponectin in blood serum negatively correlates with an insulin resistance index HOMA IR, the level of TSH, proinflammatory cytokines-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) and cortisol. The author showed direct correlations between the TSH level and proinflammatory cytokines--TNFalpha, IL-6, CRP and negative correlations between HOMA IR indexes and iodinuria. It indicates on the connection of insulin resistance with the iodine deficiency in biosphere.
