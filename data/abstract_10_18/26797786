Acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) frequently occurs in many human cancers and hampers their therapeutic use. A large body of evidence has demonstrated the pro-survival role of autophagy in many human cancers. However, whether autophagy is involved in the induction of erlotinib resistance in tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) remains unknown. In this report, we found that autophagy prior to or induced by erlotinib treatment plays an important role in erlotinib resistance in tongue cancer cells. Using LC3 transfection, we observed that autophagy is upregulated and further induced when treated with erlotinib. Moreover, we found that autophagy plays a cytoprotective role by MTT analysis of the cell viability in TSCCs when treated with rapamycin or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in combination with erlotinib. However, 3-methyladenine (3-MA) did not influence the autophagy. Then, through siRNA technology and WB, we found that erlotinib-induced autophagy is mediated by ATG5 but not Beclin1. Also, knockdown of ATG5 significantly decreased the erlotinib resistance and knockdown of Beclin1 did not affect the sensitivity to erlotinib in TSCCs. Taken together, this indicates the critical role of non-canonical autophagy in erlotinib resistance in TSCCs.
