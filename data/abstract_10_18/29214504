Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) are major complications for patients with life-threatening conditions requiring chronic vascular catheterization. The wide range of etiologic microbes and the ongoing development of resistance to antimicrobials with specific mechanisms of action make this an appropriate target for applying a nonspecific antimicrobial therapeutic. Taurolidine hydrolyzes into two antimicrobial moieties, formaldehyde and methylene glycol, which react with microbial surfaces. Neutrolin(R) (taurolidine, heparin, calcium citrate) was recently introduced in Germany as an antimicrobial catheter lock solution. This postmarketing experience collected data on 201 patients at 20 centers from January 2014 through September 2016. Likely CRBSI was observed in 13 episodes in 47,118 days (0.2759 per 1000 days [0.1468, 0.4718]). Thrombosed catheter was observed in seven catheters in 47,118 days (0.1486 per 1000 days [0.0595, 0.3061]). No adverse drug reactions that led to the discontinuation of Neutrolin(R) use were reported. Two patients experienced occasional transient dysgeusia. Neutrolin(R), when used in conjunction with guideline-based catheter care, showed reduction in the rate of both CRBSI and catheter thrombosis relative to recent historical controls.
