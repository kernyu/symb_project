WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobial stewardship programmes (ASPs) have been shown to decrease antimicrobial resistance, reduce hospital-acquired infections and decrease overall antimicrobial expenditures. At St. Joseph Medical Center in Bellingham, WA, a thrice-weekly ASP was initiated in 2010 with the goals of decreasing carbapenem, fluoroquinolone and vancomycin use and tailoring duration of therapy. METHODS: Antibiotic use per 1000 patient-days and carbapenem, fluoroquinolone and vancomycin use were evaluated pre- and post-implementation of the ASP. Total antimicrobial expenditures were evaluated for the 3 years prior to ASP implementation and three years following implementation. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Antimicrobial days of therapy per 1000 patient-days declined by 6.4% after implementation of our ASP. There was a 37% reduction in total antimicrobial expenditures after implementation. Carbapenems, vancomycin and levofloxacin use decreased considerably. Ciprofloxacin use increased during the same time period. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: A thrice-weekly, pharmacist-driven ASP can decrease antimicrobial expenditure, shorten duration of therapy and decrease the utilization of carbapenems, vancomycin and levofloxacin.
