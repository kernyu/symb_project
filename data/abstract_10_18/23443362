Emerging data, including results from two systematic reviews, suggest that with appropriate antimicrobial selection, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) can be successfully treated in less than 7 days, rather than the 7-14 days frequently utilized. Shorter course therapy has the potential not only to improve efficacy, safety, and compliance, but also to minimize the evolution of resistance. Utilization of procalcitonin as a biomarker in CAP can appropriately influence the duration of therapy without affecting mortality and cure rates. CAP treatment duration can further be reduced successfully into the clinical setting with the assistance of an antibiotic stewardship team.
