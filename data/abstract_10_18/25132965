BACKGROUND: Although the presence of Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) are extensively documented in North and South America. CPE have not been reported from Curacao. However, recently intercontinental spread was suggested of a KPC carbapenemase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in a patient in the United Kingdom with previous admission to a hospital in Curacao in 2009. FINDINGS: After the introduction of the CLSI 2010 revised breakpoints, seven patients with carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae were found in a general hospital in Curacao over a period of 16 months. Four patients carried KPC-2 positive Klebsiella pneumoniae, ST11. Two patients carried KPC-3 positive Klebsiella pneumoniae ST258 and one patient carried a KPC-3 positive Citrobacter freundii. Furthermore, our Klebsiella pneumoniae KPC-2 ST11 strain was matched to the Klebsiella pneumoniae KPC-2 ST11 strain in the United Kingdom. CONCLUSIONS: Introduction of new laboratory methods, and adoption of new guidelines and breakpoints led to the first detection of CPE in Curacao. By matching our Klebsiella pneumoniae KPC-2 ST11 strain to a Klebsiella pneumoniae KPC-2 ST11 strain in the United Kingdom, we suggest that carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae are probably more prevalent in Curacao than previously recognized.
