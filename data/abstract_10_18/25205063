Urinary tract infections (UTI) are among the most frequent bacterial infections and therefore make a significant contribution to the widespread use and extensive misuse of antibacterial drugs. The amount of antibiotics used directly correlates with the emergence of antibiotic resistance. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently issued a fact sheet highlighting the worldwide increase in antibiotic resistance. The spectrum of urological diseases affected by antibiotic resistance ranges from benign uncomplicated cystitis to severe life-threatening urosepsis and from urethritis to multidrug resistant tuberculosis. The European Section of Infections in Urology (ESIU) performs an annual surveillance study to evaluate antibiotic resistance in urology which revealed excessively high resistance rates, similar to other surveillance studies. In the light of these developments the World Alliance against Antibiotic Resistance (WAAAR) has advocated a 10-point action plan to combat the rapid rise of worldwide antibiotic resistance.
