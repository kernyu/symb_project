The photophysical properties of three cationic pi-conjugated oligomers were correlated with their visible light activated biocidal activity vs S. aureus. The oligomers contain three arylene units (terthiophene, 4a; thiophene-benzotriazole-thiophene, 4b; thiophene-benzothiadiazole-thiophene, 4c) capped on each end by cationic -(CH2)3NMe3(+) groups. The oligomers absorb in the visible region due to their donor-acceptor-donor electronic structure. Oligomers 4a and 4b have high intersystem crossing and singlet oxygen sensitization efficiency, but 4c has a very low intersystem crossing efficiency and it does not sensitize singlet oxygen. The biocidal activity of the oligomers under visible light varies in the order 4a > 4b approximately 4c.
