We conducted a retrospective study on non-typhoidal Salmonella isolates from patients with diarrhoea in Shanghai, China, 2006-2010. A total of 1484 isolates of 70 Salmonella serovars were recovered from about 18 000 stool specimens. Serovars Enteritidis and Typhimurium were the most prevalent with isolation rates of 27.6% and 25.5%, respectively. The majority (1151, 77.6%) of the isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial, and 598 (40.3%) to more than three antimicrobials. Approximately half (50.9%) of the isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid and other resistance rates were sulfisoxazole (47.9%), streptomycin (37.6%), ampicillin (31.3%) and tetracycline (30.5%). Co-resistance to fluoroquinolones and the third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins was also identified.
