Hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) has been well established as a protective factor for intestinal barrier function in intestinal epithelial cells. Recently, a study found that increased HIF-1alpha-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction. We proposed that lymphocyte-derived interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) might be responsible for the intestinal barrier dysfunction caused by increased HIF-1alpha. HT-29 cell monolayers were grown in the presence or absence of IFN-gamma under hypoxia. Then, the transepithelial electrical resistance was measured, and HIF-1alpha-modulated intestinal barrier protective factors were quantified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR, western blotting, and chromatin immunoprecipitation of HIF-1alpha were performed. Dimethyloxalyglycine (DMOG), an inhibitor of prolyl-hydroxylases (PHDs) that stabilizes HIF-1alpha during normoxia, and RNA interference of PHDs were also used to identify the signal pathway between IFN-gamma and HIF-1alpha. We demonstrated that IFN-gamma caused barrier dysfunction in hypoxic HT-29 cell monolayers via suppressing HIF-1alpha and HIF-1alpha-modulated intestinal barrier protective factors. We found that IFN-gamma decreased HIF-1alpha protein expression instead of affecting HIF-1alpha transcription or transcriptional activity. Study also showed that DMOG reversed the IFN-gamma-induced decrease in HIF-1alpha protein expression. Further, we found that PHD2 is the major regulator of IFN-gamma-induced HIF-1alpha degradation by PHD inhibition and RNA interference. We conclude that IFN-gamma caused barrier dysfunction by promoting PHD-, especially PHD2-, dependent HIF-1alpha degradation, and DMOG or PHD2 inhibition reversed this HIF-1alpha suppression and ameliorated barrier dysfunction. Combined with other studies demonstrating HIF-1alpha activation in lymphocytes promotes IFN-gamma secretion, these findings suggest a mechanism by which increased HIF-1alpha-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction.
