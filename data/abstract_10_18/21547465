OBJECTIVES: This study aims to scrutinize the hospitalized patients with the diagnosis of acute prostatitis after transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy of the prostate (TRUSBP) focusing their history of previous antibiotic use, clinical pictures, microbiologic features, and resistance patterns of the isolates. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective evaluation of the records between 2005 and 2010 revealed 13 patients. All patients received ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice a day starting from the day before TRUSBP for 5 days. RESULTS: Positive 13 urine and 7 blood samples (Escherichia coli in 12 patients, Enterococcus species in one) were evaluated for resistance patterns. All were resistant to fluoroquinolones. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing E. coli isolated in 4 patients were treated with carbapenems. Empirical ceftriaxone was shifted to carbapenem (4 patients), vancomycin (1 patient). Empirical carbapenem was maintained in 5 patients. Seven patients with elevated PSA received fluoroquinolones for 4 weeks before TRUSBP on the assumption that they had subclinical infectious prostatitis. Previous exposure to fluoroquinolones did not lead to important differences in respect to the studied parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The prompt initiation of effective treatment is essential to decrease morbidity and mortality. Empirical treatment would be a second or third generation cephalosporins, or carbapenems according to clinical severity of patients.
