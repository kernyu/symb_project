Mucosal barrier formed by cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) is believed to be crucial for host protection from pathogenic gut infection. However, some pathogens can develop resistance to the CAMPs to survive in hosts. Salmonella enterica is a common cause of acute diarrhea. During the course of this disease, the pathogen must continuously colonize the gut lumen, which contains CAMPs. However, it is incompletely understood whether the resistance of Salmonella strains to CAMPs contributes to the development of gut infections. PhoPQ two-component system-dependent lipid A modifications confer resistance to CAMPs in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium. Therefore, we introduced mutations into the PhoPQ-regulated genes in an S. Typhimurium strain, obtaining pagP ugtL and pmrA mutant strains. Each mutant strain demonstrated a distinct spectrum of the resistance to CAMPs. Using streptomycin mouse model for Salmonella diarrhea, we show that the pagP ugtL, but not pmrA, mutant strain had a gut colonization defect. Furthermore, the pagP ugtL, but not pmrA, mutant strain had decreased outer membrane integrity and susceptibility to magainin 2, an alpha-helical CAMP. Taken together, the PagP- and UgtL-dependent resistance to CAMPs was demonstrated to contribute to sustained colonization in the gut. This may be due to the robust outer membrane of S. Typhimurium, inducing the resistance to alpha-helical CAMPs such as alpha-defensins. Our findings indicate that the development of resistance to CAMPs is required for the S. Typhimurium gut infection.
