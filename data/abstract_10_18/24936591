Fosfomycin monotherapy was compared to therapy with vancomycin for the treatment of implant-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) osteomyelitis in an experimental rat model. The proximal tibiae were inoculated with 15 mul of a suspension containing 1x10(8) to 5x10(8) CFU/ml of a clinical isolate of MRSA with simultaneous insertion of a titanium wire. Four weeks later, treatment was started for 28 days with either 50 mg/kg of body weight vancomycin intraperitoneally twice daily (n=11) or 75 mg/kg fosfomycin intraperitoneally once daily (n=10). Eleven animals were left untreated. After treatment, quantitative cultures from bone were found to be positive for MRSA in all animals in the untreated group (median, 3.29x10(6) CFU/g of bone) and the vancomycin group (median, 3.03x10(5) CFU/g of bone). In the fosfomycin group, MRSA was detectable in 2 out of 10 (20%) animals (3.42x10(2) and 1.51x10(3) CFU/g of bone). Vancomycin was superior to the no-drug control (P=0.002), and fosfomycin was superior to the no-drug control and vancomycin (P<0.001). The cultures from the wires were positive in all untreated animals (median, 2.5x10(3) CFU/implant), in 10 animals in the vancomycin group (median, 1.15x10(3) CFU/implant), and negative in all animals in the fosfomycin group. Based on the bacterial counts from the implants, vancomycin was not superior to the no-drug control (P=0.324), and fosfomycin was superior to the no-drug control and vancomycin (P<0.001). No emergence of resistance was observed. In conclusion, it was demonstrated that fosfomycin monotherapy is highly effective for the treatment of experimental implant-associated MRSA osteomyelitis.
