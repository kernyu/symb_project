Seven N-cinnamoyltetraketides (1-7), including the new Z-toussaintine E (2), toussaintine F (6), and toussaintine G (7), were isolated from the methanol extract of the leaves of Toussaintia orientalis using column chromatography and HPLC. The configurations of E-toussaintine E (1) and toussaintines A (3) and D (5) are revised based on single-crystal X-ray diffraction data from racemic crystals. Both the crude methanol extract and the isolated constituents exhibit antimycobacterial activities (MIC 83.3-107.7 muM) against the H37Rv strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Compounds 1, 3, 4, and 5 are cytotoxic (ED50 15.3-105.7 muM) against the MDA-MB-231 triple negative aggressive breast cancer cell line.
