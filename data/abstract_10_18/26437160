Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is a common autoimmune blistering disease in the adult population, but extremely rare in the pediatric population. Childhood BP usually has a favorable prognosis and responds well to topical and oral steroids. However, for patients that do not respond to corticosteroids, therapeutic alternatives are scarce. We report a case of a toddler with recalcitrant BP who was successfully treated with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF).
