Plasmodium falciparum Pfcrt-76 and Pfmdr1-86 gene polymorphisms were determined during a clinical trial in Burkina Faso comparing the efficacies of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ) and artemether-lumefantrine (AL). Significant selection of Pfcrt-K76 was observed after exposure to AL and DHA-PPQ, as well as selection of Pfmdr1-N86 after AL but not DHA-PPQ treatment, suggesting reverse selection on the Pfcrt gene by PPQ. These results support the rational use of DHA-PPQ in settings where chloroquine (CQ) resistance is high.
