OBJECTIVES: In the Netherlands there is an ongoing debate regarding environmental health risks of livestock farming for neighbouring residents. This explorative study aims to determine the prevalence of carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and/or plasmid-mediated AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL/pAmpC-E) in the general population living in a livestock-dense area, and to study associations between determinants, including exposure through contact with animals and the environment, and human carriage of ESBL/pAmpC-E. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed among 2432 adults (aged 20-72 years) in 12 temporary research centres in the south of the Netherlands, consisting of a questionnaire and analysis of a faecal sample to assess carriage of ESBL/pAmpC-E. Risk factors were analysed using logistic regression. RESULTS: The prevalence for carriage of ESBL/pAmpC-E was 4.5% (109/2432; 95% CI 3.7-5.4) ranging from 1.4% to 10.9% among the research centres. ESBL/pAmpC resistance genes were detected in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates obtained from these 109 persons and the most common ESBL-resistance genes were blaCTX-M-15, blaCTX-M-14/17 and blaCTX-M-1, originating from 76 participants. Travel in the previous 12 months to Africa, Asia or Latin America (OR 2.82; 95% CI 1.71-4.63), having kept cows for a hobby in the previous 5 years (OR 3.77; 95% CI 1.22-11.64), usage of proton-pump inhibitors (OR 1.84; 95% CI 1.05-3.23), and living within 1000 m of a mink farm (OR 2.26; 95% CI 1.28-3.98) were identified as risk factors. Exposure to poultry was not identified as a risk factor. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, living in close proximity to livestock animals and farms does not seem to be a risk factor for carriage of ESBL/pAmpC-E.
