BACKGROUND: The incidence of coagulase-negative staphylococcal (CoNS) sepsis is high in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and treatment significantly adds to the antibiotic pressure, increasing the threat of resistance. Because infants recover within 24-48 h, blood cultures are negative within 48 h and CRP normalizes within 72 h, we reduced anti-CoNS treatment from 7 to 3 days in infants with uncomplicated CoNS sepsis. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of short (3 days) treatment duration for CoNS sepsis. METHODS: All infants with CoNS sepsis from January 2006 to September 2010 were evaluated. Before 2008 the duration of anti-CoNS treatment was 7 days, but in 2008 it was reduced to 3 days, provided that infants recovered within 48 h, CRP value decreased, thrombocytes were normal and central venous catheters were either not present or removed. Clinical results of treatment for 3 days were compared with 7 days of treatment. RESULTS: There were 142 infants with CoNS sepsis who were eligible for 3 days of antimicrobial treatment duration, 62 (44%) from the period 2006-2008 were treated over 7 days (Group 1) and 80 (56%) from the period 2008-2010 were treated over 3 days (Group 2). Clinical characteristics were not different between the groups. All infants recovered within 48 h and CoNS sepsis did not relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic treatment for CoNS sepsis may be shortened to 3 days when clinical improvement is rapid and central lines are not present. Prospective randomized studies are needed to confirm the results of this single-center study. Future studies may reveal the effects on the development of antimicrobial resistance.
