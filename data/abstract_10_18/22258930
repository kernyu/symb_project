OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate and characterize the efficacy of asiaticoside in an experimental model of visceral leishmaniasis caused by antimony-susceptible (AG83) and -resistant (GE1F8R and K39) Leishmania donovani. METHODS: The effect of asiaticoside was evaluated by microscopic counting of intracellular amastigotes in cultured macrophages stained with Giemsa. The antileishmanial effect of the compounds was assessed in infected BALB/c mice by estimation of splenic and liver parasite burdens in Leishman Donovan units. Cytokines were measured by real-time PCR and ELISA. Intracellular tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Nitric oxide was measured by the Griess reaction. RESULTS: Besides effectively inhibiting in vitro replication of the parasite within macrophages, asiaticoside treatment resulted in almost complete clearance of the liver and splenic parasite burden when administered at a dose of 5 mg/kg x 10 starting on day +30 of challenge with antimony-susceptible (AG83) and -resistant (GE1F8R and K39) L. donovani. Asiaticoside treatment was associated with a switch in the host from a Th2- to a Th1-type immune response accompanied by the induction of TNF-alpha-mediated nitric oxide production, all of which are important elements for macrophage function in antileishmanial defence mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that oral therapy with asiaticoside shows promising antileishmanial efficacy in animals infected by antimony-susceptible (AG83) and -resistant (GE1F8R and K39) L. donovani.
