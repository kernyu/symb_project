AIMS: The present study aims to evaluate the predominance of uropathogens responsible for urinary tract infection (UTI) and determine their resistance patterns, to assess if the recommended empirical treatment is appropriate for the studied population. Samples were collected in Aveiro (Portugal) from an ambulatory service between June 2011 and June 2014. RESULTS: From the 4,270 positive urine samples for UTI, 3,561 (83%) were from women and only 709 (17%) were from men. The bacterium Escherichia coli was the most frequent uropathogen, followed by Klebsiella sp., Enterococcus sp., and Proteus mirabilis. E. coli was also the uropathogen presenting less resistance to antibiotics, including those recommended as first and second line UTI treatment. In general, bacteria isolated from men were more resistant to antimicrobials than bacteria isolated from women. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study emphasized the relevance to consider sex as a differentiating factor in the choice of UTI empirical treatment, mainly due to differences in antimicrobial resistance. From the first line drugs recommended by the European Association of Urology (EAU) to empirical treatment of uncomplicated UTI, nitrofurantoin is the most appropriate drug for both sexes. Ciprofloxacin, although appropriate for treatment in women, is not appropriate to treat UTIs in men. From the second line drugs, both trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (AMX-CA) are appropriate drugs for treatment of uncomplicated UTI in women, but not as effective for men.
