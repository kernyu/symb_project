Dry cow therapy is an important part of mastitis control. This therapy typically consists of an antibiotic or antibiotics administered at a single dose by intramammary infusion at dry off to treat or prevent infection by prevalent mastitis pathogens. A combination dry cow therapy consisting of the active components penicillin and framycetin is currently used in several countries. Despite its use, standardized methods for the susceptibility testing of this combination against mastitis pathogens have not been established. In this study, which used Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute methodology, preliminary interpretive criteria for the broth microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing of mastitis pathogens to penicillin combined with framycetin (2:1 wt/wt) were established based on the amount of drug achieved and maintained postadministration in the udder. Based on resulting MIC distributions of recent veterinary field isolates and a subset of isolates preselected for resistance to beta-lactams or aminoglycosides and concentrations achieved postadministration, criteria for broth microdilution testing of the combination (susceptible, intermediate, resistant in micrograms per milliliter) were set as follows: Escherichia coli </=8/4, 16/8, >/=32/16; Staphylococcus spp. </=2/1, 4/2-8/4, >16/8; Streptococcus uberis and Streptococcus dysgalactiae <0.25/0.12, 0.5/0.25-2/1, >4/2. A disk diffusion test using disks containing 100 mug of framycetin and 10 IU of penicillin was also developed, and preliminary interpretive criteria (susceptible, intermediate, resistant in millimeters) were set based on correlation to broth MIC values and the minimization of interpretive errors between isolates tested concurrently by broth microdilution and disk diffusion as follows: E. coli >/=18, 16-17, </=15; Staphylococcus spp. >/=21, 18-20, </=17; Strep. uberis and Strep. dysgalactiae >/=21, 19-20, </=18. In addition, ranges for the quality control of the testing of this combination by both broth microdilution and disk diffusion are provided. Based on these criteria and recent veterinary mastitis isolates, 96.0/96.8% of E. coli, 93.7/89.1% of Staph. aureus, 94.6/96.4% coagulase-negative staphylococci, 94.5/97.0% of Strep. uberis, and 96.7/100.0% Strep. dysgalactiae were susceptible to the combination by broth microdilution or disk diffusion, respectively. The availability of these methods will allow for the susceptibility testing of clinical isolates in the field and will also provide a way to monitor for resistance development as this combination is used going forward.
