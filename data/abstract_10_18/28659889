We developed a methodology for antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) based on the BacterioScan(TM)216R laser scattering technology, using methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin resistance in enterococci as exemplar for important resistance phenotypes. Fifty methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and 50 methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) S. aureus, as well as 50 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and 50 vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (VSE) isolates were used for the study. Optimal test conditions were derived by investigating the effects of inoculum size, medium, incubation temperature and broth filtration. We proposed four different statistical approaches for rapid discrimination between resistant and susceptible bacteria. The statistical approach based on raw measurements of bacterial concentrations delivered sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 94% for discrimination between MRSA and MSSA already after 3 hours of incubation. Categorical agreement of >/=90% was achieved after 140 min with this approach. Differentiation between VRE and VSE was possible with 98% sensitivity and 92% specificity after 3 hours, using a sophisticated statistical approach based on concentration slopes derived from the raw concentration measurements. This approach provided categorical agreement of >/=90% after 165 min. The sensitivity and specificity estimates were confirmed by leave-one-out cross validation. In conclusion, the phenotypic AST methods developed in this study are promising for rapid detection of MRSA and VRE. The development and application of this technology would allow early detection of the resistant pathogens, thus facilitating swift change to the targeted antimicrobial treatment as well as timely initiation of appropriate infection control measures. Further studies are warranted to validate this approach for the detection of other resistance phenotypes, including direct testing from clinical specimens.
