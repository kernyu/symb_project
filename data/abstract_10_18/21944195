A rise in drug-resistant bacteria coupled with a decline in the development of new classes of antibiotics has increased the need for new local antibiotic delivery methods. To address this need, we have previously developed layer-by-layer assembled films releasing the potent antibiotic, vancomycin, for use as coatings for on-demand care. In this work, we explore the potential for practical application of these films through an in-depth study of their long term storage stability over a wide range of temperatures, including refrigerator, room and elevated temperature (4, 25 and 37 degrees C, respectively). Our results indicate that the drug-release profiles and minimum inhibitory concentration against Staphylococcus aureus of vancomycin released from films stored at these different conditions are not affected over a period of 1-6 months. Consequently, these films can be used where traditional refrigeration of prepared intravenous vancomycin solutions or immediate reconstitution of lyophilized vancomycin is not possible.
