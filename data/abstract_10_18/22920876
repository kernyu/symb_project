Fungal biofilms associated with inserted medical devices such as catheters, represent a major risk factor for candidemia. In addition, these biofilm yeasts show a decreased susceptibility to antifungal agents. Recently, a new therapeutic approach has emerged, the "lock therapy", based on the use of high concentrations of antimicrobials, instilled into the lumen of the catheter and left in place for 8 to 12 h. In vitro or in vivo studies have evaluated the interest of antifungal locks using amphotericin B, an azole or echinocandins. The promising results will permit us to discuss the relevance of this technique.
