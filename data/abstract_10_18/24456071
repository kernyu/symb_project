Biofilm formation is closely related to bacterial infection and is also a mechanism of antimicrobial resistance. Hence, the antibiofilm approach provides an alternative to an antibiotic strategy. In this study, the antibiofilm activities of resveratrol (1) and five of its oligomers, namely, epsilon-viniferin (2), suffruticosol A (3), suffruticosol B (4), vitisin A (5), and vitisin B (6), were investigated against enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14. Vitisin B (6), a stilbenoid tetramer, was found to inhibit biofilm formation by the two bacteria the most effectively and at 5 mug/mL inhibited E. coli O157:H7 biofilm formation by more than 90%.
