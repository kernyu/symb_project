The ribosomal L3 protein was identified as a novel target in linezolid (LZD)-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. Next-generation sequencing confirmed rplC T460C as the sole mutation in an LZD-resistant M. tuberculosis H37Rv strain selected in vitro. Sequencing analysis revealed the rplC T460C mutation in eight further LZD-resistant isolates (three in vitro-selected mutants and five patient isolates, including isolates from three different patients that developed LZD resistance during treatment) but in none of the susceptible control strains (n = 84).
