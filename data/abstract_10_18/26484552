BACKGROUND: Vascular extracellular matrices (vECMs) have shown potential for small-diameter blood vessel tissue engineering applications. However, problems such as chemical instability and easy calcification are still remained. Chemical crosslinking using crosslinkers such as glutaraldehyde (GA) can improve mechanical properties and proteolysis resistance of vECMs, but leads to calcification and cytotoxicity. Procyanidins (PC) can crosslink ECMs with anti-calcification property and cytocompatibility, but the mechanical properties and chemical stability are unsatisfactory. OBJECTIVE: A novel co-crosslinking technique using PC and GA was developed, which combines the advantages of both PC and GA for enhancing mechanical properties and stability of vECMs with reduced calcification and cytotoxicity. METHODS: Fresh carotid were decellularized and then crosslinked by PC and subsequent GA for 6 h respectively. The mechanical properties, dynamic release of PC, enzymatic degradation, calcification and cytotoxicity of crosslinked samples were evaluated. RESULTS: The co-crosslinked vECMs showed enhanced tensile strength, chemical and biological stability, comparable anti-calcification property as compared to pure PC-crosslinked samples. Cytotoxicity assay showed that the co-crosslinked vECMs were cytocompatible for supporting the adhesion and proliferation of HUVECs. CONCLUSIONS: Co-crosslinking with PC and GA might be a useful method for preparation of vECM scaffolds with potential applications in small-diameter blood vessel tissue engineering.
