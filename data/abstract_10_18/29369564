According to the results of analysis of whole genome sequencing, the presence of genes having resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in hospital-associated strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae was studied. The strains were isolated from neonatal intensive care units. The data obtained were compared with the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing of isolated microorganisms. Among other strains resistant to cephalosporins, the dominance of genes of CTX-M-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases was shown. It was revealed that one of eight strains phenotypically resistant and moderately resistant to carbapenems have the blaOXA-48 carbapenemase gene.
