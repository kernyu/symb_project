Objectives: Among viridans group streptococcal infective endocarditis (IE), the Streptococcus mitis group is the most common aetiological organism. Treatment of IE caused by the S. mitis group is challenging due to the high frequency of beta-lactam resistance, drug allergy and intolerability of mainstay antimicrobial agents such as vancomycin or gentamicin. Daptomycin has been suggested as an alternative therapeutic option in these scenarios based on its excellent susceptibility profile against S. mitis group strains . However, the propensity of many S. mitis group strains to rapidly evolve stable, high-level daptomycin resistance potentially limits this approach. Methods: We evaluated the activity of 6 mg/kg/day daptomycin alone or in combination with gentamicin, ceftriaxone or ceftaroline against two daptomycin-susceptible S. mitis group strains over 96 h in a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model of simulated endocardial vegetations. Results: Daptomycin alone was not bactericidal and high-level daptomycin resistance evolved at 96 h in both organisms. Combinations of daptomycin + ceftriaxone and daptomycin + ceftaroline demonstrated enhanced killing activity compared with each antibiotic alone and prevented emergence of daptomycin resistance at 96 h. Use of gentamicin as an adjunctive agent neither improved the efficacy of daptomycin nor prevented the development of daptomycin resistance. Conclusions: Addition of ceftriaxone or ceftaroline to daptomycin improves the bactericidal activity against S. mitis group strains and prevents daptomycin resistance emergence. Further investigation with combinations of daptomycin and beta-lactams in a large number of strains is warranted to fully elucidate the clinical implications of such combinations for treatment of S. mitis group IE.
