BACKGROUND: Misuse of antibiotics can lead to the development of antibiotic resistance, which adversely affects morbidity, mortality, length of stay, and cost. To combat the threat of antimicrobial resistance, The Joint Commission and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services have initiated or proposed requirements for hospitals to have antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs), but implementation remains challenging. A key-informant interview study was conducted to describe the characteristics and innovative strategies of leading ASPs. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 12 program leaders at four ASPs in the United States, chosen by purposive sampling on the basis of national reputation, scholarship, and geography. Questions focused on ASP implementation, program structure, strengths, weaknesses, lessons learned, and future directions. Content analysis was used to identify dominant themes. RESULTS: Three major themes were identified. The first was evolution of ASPs from a top-down structure to a more diffuse approach involving unit-based pharmacists, multidisciplinary staff, and shared responsibility for antimicrobial prescribing under the ASPs' leadership. The second theme was integration of information technology (IT) systems, which enabled real-time interventions to optimize antimicrobial therapy and patient management. The third was barriers to technology integration, including limited resources for data analysis and poor interoperability between software systems. CONCLUSION: The study provides valuable insights on program implementation at a sample of leading ASPs across the United States. These ASPs used expansion of personnel to amplify the ASP's impact and integrated IT resources into daily work flow to improve efficiency. These findings can be used to guide implementation at other hospitals and aid in future policy development.
