BACKGROUND: We conducted a case-control study to identify risk factors for efflux overexpression, an important mechanism of fluoroquinolone resistance, among patients with fluoroquinolone-resistant Escherichia coli (FQREC) gastrointestinal tract colonization. METHODS: Three annual fecal surveillance surveys were performed hospital-wide, and all patients colonized with FQREC (levofloxacin minimum inhibitory concentration, >/=8 mug/mL) were included in the study. Cases and controls were defined on the basis of overexpression of the AcrAB efflux pump, as measured by the organic solvent tolerance (OST) assay. A multivariable logistic regression model was developed to identify risk factors for OST positivity among patients with FQREC colonization. RESULTS: Eighty-nine patients were colonized with FQREC: 44 (49.4%) and 45 (50.6%) patients had isolates that were OST-positive and OST-negative, respectively. On multivariable analyses, location on the surgical service was significantly associated with recovery of an OST-positive isolate (odds ratio, 7.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.82-29.7; P = .005). Furthermore, patients who had received a first-generation cephalosporin in the 30 days prior to sampling were less likely to have an OST-positive isolate (odds ratio, 0.20; 95% confidence interval, .04-.94; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: Among phenotypically identical FQREC isolates, different factors may drive the emergence of different resistance mechanisms. Further studies are needed to elucidate the relationship between antimicrobial use and specific resistance mechanisms.
