INTRODUCTION: Antibiotic combination therapy for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori should be based on local resistance patterns. OBJECTIVE: To d etermine the resistance of H. pylori to clarithromycin in a population from Cauca province, through the identification of mutations in the 23S rRNA gene in DNA from gastric biopsies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 162 patients with functional dyspepsia were included in the study. The 23S rRNA gene and the DNA from 162 gastric specimens were amplified by PCR, and the mutation pattern was identified by direct sequencing. RESULTS: The frequency of clarithromycin resistance was 4%. A2143G mutation was found in four patients (2.46%) and A2142G mutation was found in three patients (1.85%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that the most frequent genotype in H. pylori -positive specimens was A2143G, followed by A2142G. The observed resistance prevalence of H. pylori was low; thus, we consider that clarithromycin treatment is a valid option for H. pylori eradication in the study population.
