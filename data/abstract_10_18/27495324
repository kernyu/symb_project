PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of povidone-iodine rectal disinfection and targeted antimicrobial prophylaxis in men undergoing transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy based on rectal swab culture results. METHODS: From January 2011 to December 2015, we studied differences in infectious complications in men who received povidone-iodine rectal disinfection with targeted antimicrobial prophylaxis and those who received empirical prophylaxis before transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy. Clinical variables including demographics, prior antibiotic, rectal swab culture results, povidone-iodine rectal cleansing, antibiotic prophylaxis, and infectious complications were evaluated. Patients were divided into three groups as follows: Group A received no povidone-iodine rectal cleansing but received empirical antimicrobial prophylaxis; group B received povidone-iodine rectal cleansing and empirical antimicrobial prophylaxis; and group C received povidone-iodine rectal cleansing and targeted antimicrobial prophylaxis. RESULTS: Patients were divided into group A (n = 192; 13.2 %), group B (n = 579; 39.9 %), or group C (n = 679; 46.8 %). In groups A and B, all patients received fluoroquinolone antimicrobial prophylaxis. Group C patients received targeted antimicrobial prophylaxis according to antibiotic resistance of rectal flora, and 71.1 % of these received fluoroquinolone antimicrobial prophylaxis. Infectious complication rates were 3.6, 2.9, and 1.3 % in group A, group B, and group C, respectively. Incidences of acute prostatitis and bacteremia were significantly lower in group C (p = 0.041 and p = 0.049, respectively) than in the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: In the era of quinolone resistance, the combination of povidone-iodine rectal cleansing and targeted antibiotic prophylaxis may reduce the rate of infectious complications.
