In a multicenter, multinational observational study that included neutropenic patients with bloodstream infections by extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing species, Gudiol et al. (Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 61:e00164-17, 2017, https://doi.org/10.1128/AAC.00164-17) demonstrated that beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors are effective treatment options. A review of this work, however, reminds us that some lingering questions remain for specific high-risk subgroups.
