The combination of ampicillin plus ceftaroline has been suggested to be more reliably synergistic against Enterococcus faecalis than ampicillin plus ceftriaxone using time-kill methods. The purpose of this study was to determine if this trend persists in a two-compartment model of simulated endocardial vegetations (SEV) using clinically relevant pharmacokinetic exposures of these antimicrobials. Three clinically derived E. faecalis strains were included in the study. The MICs of study antimicrobials were determined by broth microdilution. Simulations of ampicillin (2 g every 4 h [q4h]; maximum concentration of drug in serum [Cmax], 72.4 mg/liter; half-life [t1/2], 1.9 h), ceftaroline-fosamil (600 mg q8h; Cmax, 21.3 mg/liter; t1/2, 2.66 h), ceftriaxone (Cmax, 257 mg/liter; t1/2, 8 h), and ampicillin plus ceftaroline and ampicillin plus ceftriaxone were evaluated against 3 strains of E. faecalis isolated from patients with endocarditis in an in vitro PK/PD SEV model over 72 h, with a starting inoculum of approximately 9 log10 CFU/g. All strains were susceptible to ampicillin (MIC, </=2 mg/liter). Ceftaroline MICs varied from 2 to 16 mg/liter. All strains had ceftriaxone MICs of 256 mg/liter. W04 and W151 exhibited high-level aminoglycoside resistance but W07 did not. Ampicillin plus ceftaroline resulted in significantly greater reductions in CFU per gram by 72 h than ampicillin for all strains (P </= 0.025) than ampicillin plus ceftriaxone for W04 (P = 0.019) but not W07 or W151 (P >/= 0.15). A 4-fold increase in ampicillin MIC was observed for W07 at 72 h, but this was prevented by the addition of ceftaroline or ceftriaxone. The combination of ampicillin plus ceftaroline appears to be at least as efficacious as ampicillin plus ceftriaxone and may lead to improved activity against some strains of E. faecalis, but these differences may be small and the clinical significance should not be overestimated.
