Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) have spread globally and represent a serious and growing threat to public health. The introduction of rapid and sensitive methods for the detection of carbapenemase-producing bacteria is of increasing importance. The carbapenemase production can be detected using non-molecular methods (such as the modified Hodge test, the synergy test, the Carba NP test and the antibiotic hydrolysis assays) and DNA-based methods. In this study, we propose a modified version of a previously described meropenem hydrolysis assay (MHA) by MALDI-TOF MS for the phenotypic detection in 2h of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. The MHA was successfully applied to detect carbapenemase activity in 981 well-characterized Enterobacteriaceae strains producing KPC or VIM carbapenemases, and in 146 carbapenem fully susceptible strains. This assay, applied also to NDM and OXA-48-producing strains and to CRE with resistance mechanisms other than carbapenemase production, has proved to be able to distinguish between carbapenemase-producing and -nonproducing Enterobacteriaceae. As already stated and as observed in our hands, MHA by MALDI-TOF MS analysis is independent from the type of carbapenemases involved, it is faster and easier to perform/interpret than culture-based methods. On the other hand, it cannot detect other carbapenem resistance mechanisms, such as porin alterations and efflux mechanisms.
