OBJECTIVE: We estimated the prevalence and identified the resistance pattern of HBV genotypes H and G in HBV monoinfected and HIV co-infected patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional prevalence and analytic study were performed in chronic hepatitis B patients at the Hospital de Infectologia, La Raza National Medical Center in Mexico City. Chronic HBV monoinfected and HIV co-infected patients were included. HBeAg, HBV viral load and genetic analysis of mutations were collected; CD4+ cells count from HIV co-infected patients and HIV RNA were measured. We calculated the prevalence and exact 95% binomial confidence interval and the Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals to assess the relationship between the presence of risk factors and HBV genotypes H or G. RESULTS: We enrolled 77 patients, 67 men and 10 women with 37 HIV co-infected patients. The distribution of HBV genotypes was: HBV genotype H 55 (71% [95% CI 60% to 80%]), HBV genotype G 16 (20.7%), HBV genotype F 4 (5.1%) and HBV genotype A 2 (2.6%). The most frequent mutations presented in 8 HIV co-infected patients and one mono-infected patient with antiretroviral therapy (ART) experience were rtM204V and six of them showed genotype G (6/9). Mono-infected HBV patients exposed more probability to HBV genotype H than co-infected HIV patients OR 13.0 (CI 95% 3.40-49.79), p = 0.0001. In contrast co-infected patients presented less possibility to have genotype H, 0.56 (CI 95% 0.42-0.75). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the high prevalence of HBV genotype H in Mexico; furthermore, our results suggest that HBV genotype G predominates in co-infected patients. As well, rtM204V and rtL180M mutations are common in HBV-HIV co-infected patients with genotype G and ART experience.
