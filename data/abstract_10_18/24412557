Light alcohol consumption was reported to be negatively associated with insulin resistance and risk of cardiovascular diseases; however, the results were inconsistent. We here investigate whether long term intake of low-concentration ethanol can affect adiponectin levels. Male Wistar rats were exposed to 0.1% ethanol in drinking water for 26weeks. Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) was cultured and treated with ethanol, SB203580, GW9662, or rosiglitazone. Adiponectin in serum and culture supernatant were measured by ELISA, mRNA levels of adiponectin and PPARgamma were determined by RT-PCR, and protein expressions of PPARgamma, p38 MAPK and phospho-p38 MAPK were determined by Western blot. In vivo, ethanol decreased the mRNA of adiponectin in VAT and serum adiponectin significantly. Decreased PPARgamma and increased activation of p38 MAPK were observed in ethanol treated group. In vitro, SB203580 increased the adiponectin and PPARgamma levels in normal DMEM cultured VAT and ameliorated ethanol-induced decrease of adiponectin and PPARgamma expressions. GW9662 also decreased the adiponectin levels; Both ethanol and GW9662 weakened the rosiglitazone-induced elevation of adiponectin levels in cultured VAT. These data suggest that long term intake of 0.1% ethanol down-regulated adiponectin levels, and the regulation of PPARgamma via p38 MAPK pathway plays an important role in the mechanism underneath.
