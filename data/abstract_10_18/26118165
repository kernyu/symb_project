The biofilm mode of life conveys a survival advantage to the microorganism associated with it. Biofilm on an indwelling urinary catheter consists of adherent microorganisms, their extra cellular products, and host components deposited on the catheter and thus biofilm on urinary catheters results in persistent infections that are resistant to antimicrobial therapy. This study was done during the period of January 2010 to December 2010. Fifty nine enterococci isolated from 1203 urine samples were speciated by conventional microbiological methods and examined for their ability to form biofilm by microtitre plate assay and antimicrobial susceptibility testing by disc diffusion method for 10 clinically relevant antibiotics respectively. Biofilm producing Enterococci were more frequently found in catheterized than in non catheterized patient (p < 0.004). Enterococcus faecium showed increased resistantance to multiple antibiotic than Enterococcus faecalis. Significant relationship was found between biofilm production with antibiotic resistance to amoxicillin, co-trimoxazole, ciprofloxacin, gentamycin, cefotaxime, and cefuroxime. This study demonstrated a high propensity among the isolates of Enterococci to form biofilm and a significant association of biofilms with multiple drug resistance.
