A combined use of MAS-PCR (multiplex allele-specific PCR) and PCR-RFLP (PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism), was established to detect mutations in codons 90, 91 and 94 of the gyrA gene in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis). With conventional phenotypic drug susceptibility testing as a reference standard, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the modified method for gyrA gene mutation detection were 70.8%, 100% and 84.8% respectively.
