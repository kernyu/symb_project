Among 62 clinical strains of enterobacteria, isolated from intestinal tract, representatives of genus Escherichia made--67.4%, Klebsiella--4.84%, Citrobacter--4.84%, Enterobacter--8.06%, Proteus--6.45%, Morganella of 8.06%. Preparations of fluorquinolone group--gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin, the number of steady strains being from 0.0% to 33.3%, were the most effective in respect of enterobacteria The investigated strains of enterobacteria showed considerable resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. The highest sensitivity has been noted to cefotaxim: Escherichia spp.--7.1%, Citrobacter spp.-0.0%, Klebsiella spp.--33.3%, Enterobacter spp.--20.0%, Proteus spp.--25.0%, Morganella spp.--20.0% of steady strains. Among 62 isolated strains of enterobacteria 48 produced beta-lactamases. Production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) has been found out in 100% of strains of Klebsiella spp., 81.8% of Escherichia spp., 66.7% of Enterobacter spp., 33.3% of Citrobacter spp. and Proteus spp.--from total amount of strains producing beta-lactamases.
