The present study was aimed to assess the efficacy of developed transfersome (TF-3) formulation bearing amphotericin B (AmB) against sensitive and resistant clinical isolates of L donovani and compared with conventional liposomal formulation (F-2) and free AmB (F-1). The skin permeation of AmB from TF-3 was performed using Franz diffusion cell using rat skin which showed fickian diffusion across the skin. When tested against L. donovani (intramacrophagic amastigotes), it has been observed that TF was more effective than F-1 and F-2 formulation in sensitive and resistant clinical isolates. The data provides evidences that the TF formulation owing to its fluidized behaviour imparted by sodium deoxycholate, enables to penetrate well in the infected cells and thus provide enhanced activity. The permeation study also supports this data as the flux value of AmB through TF formulation was 1.5 fold higher compared to conventional liposomes suggesting improved penetration and better partitioning in skin layers. Implicit to this preliminary data it is evident that the AmB loaded TF formulation has potential as alternate chemotherapeutic approach to control of VL. Potential utilities of novel formulation as a transdermal delivery of AmB for leishmaniasis necessitates further elaborated investigations which is underway in our laboratory.
