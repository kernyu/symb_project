Adefovir is one of the therapeutic options for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. A total of 30 adefovir-experienced subjects with the median treatment duration of 12 (interquartile range (IQR) 6-18) months were studied. Virological response was measured by hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid (HBV DNA) levels. HBV reverse transcriptase (rt) domains were sequenced for the identification of resistance mutations. Among the 30 subjects, two (7%) showed virological response and 19 (63%) were non-responders. The virological response for the remaining nine (30%) subjects was not determined. On sequence analysis, two subjects were identified with rtI169L and rtA181V mutation after 9 months and 18 months of adefovir treatment, respectively. Though the frequencies of adefovir resistance mutations are low, a large majority of subjects showed non-response. Therefore, adefovir in the management of HBV should be used judiciously.
