BACKGROUND: In the context of a methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) outbreak, we aimed to improve our knowledge of S. aureus (SA) epidemiology in the neonatal care center (NCC) of a tertiary care teaching hospital. METHODS: We performed a complete one-year review of SA carrier, colonized or infected patients. Monthly prevalence and incidence of SA intestinal carriage, colonization and infection were calculated and the types of infection analysed. During the MSSA outbreak, strains were studied for antimicrobial resistance, content of virulence genes and comparative fingerprint in Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis. Hand hygiene and catheter-related practices were assessed by direct observational audits. Environmental investigation was performed in search of a SA reservoir. RESULTS: Epidemiological analyses showed 2 or 3 prevalence peaks on a background of SA endemicity. In the NCC, during 2009, overall MSSA prevalence did not decrease below 5.5%, while mean MRSA prevalence was about 1.53%. Analysis of infection cases revealed that the outbreak corresponded to the emergence of catheter-related infections and was probably related to the relaxation in infection control practices in a context of high colonization pressure. Health care workers' white coats appeared as a potential environmental reservoir that could perpetuate SA circulation in the ward. CONCLUSION: This report emphasizes the importance of integrating MSSA along with methicillin-resistant SA in a program of epidemiological surveillance in the NCC.
