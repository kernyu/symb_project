AIM: In this study, we collected group B streptococcus (GBS) screening data and analyzed screening rate, antimicrobial resistance rate, and neonatal observation room (NOR) admission rate due to inadequate chemoprophylaxis. METHODS: The GBS screening data for January 2006-December 2013 were retrospectively collected and analyzed. We also collected data for neonates admitted to NOR due to inadequate chemoprophylaxis during the period 1 April 2010-31 December 2013. RESULTS: A total of 12 200 pregnant women received rectovaginal culture during the 8-year study period. The overall screening rate was 53.8% and maternal colonization rate was 20.7%. The GBS screening rate increased remarkably, from 23.2% in 2006 to 70% in 2013. Antimicrobial resistance was common. The resistance rates for each antimicrobial used in pregnancy were as follows: clindamycin, 49.51%; erythromycin, 49.51%. A total of 297 neonates were admitted to NOR due to inadequate antibiotic prophylaxis during 1 April 2010-31 December 2013. The overall NOR admission rate due to inadequate chemoprophylaxis was 2.67%, and the inadequate chemoprophylaxis rate for those GBS colonized mothers was 19.6%. None of these 297 infants had positive blood culture for GBS sepsis. CONCLUSION: The GBS screening rate increased remarkably, reaching 70% in 2013. The NOR admission rate due to inadequate chemoprophylaxis was 2.67% and there was no early onset GBS disease in a total of 11 123 deliveries in this 4-year cohort study.
