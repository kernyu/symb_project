UNLABELLED: We evaluated the performances and analyzed practicability of an ESBL-detecting chromogenic agar medium (chromID ESBL, bioMerieux) for the screening of ESBL production. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We have tested 112 enterobacteria strains, isolated in 2009 year, in North Eastern region of Romania. Each bacterial strain was cultured on a prepared plate chromogenic medium and the results were recorded after incubation at 37 degrees C for 18 to 24 h or, if necessary, for 48 h. We calculated the sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative predictive values for this medium, using as gold standard ceftzidime or cefotaxime and clavulanate combination disks on Iso-Sensitest agar. K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 and E. coli ATCC 25922 were used as the positive and negative control for ESBL production, respectively. RESULTS: For all tested strains, the chromID ESBL agar showed a high sensitivity (97%), but a low specificity (66%). The positive and negative predictive values were 98% and 57%, respectively. The chromID ESBL had false-positive results for 2 confirmed ESBL-positive strains. CONCLUSION: The very good sensitivity of the chromID ESBL agar ESBL detection represent a convenient method for the recovery and identification of ESBL-producing enterobacteria.
