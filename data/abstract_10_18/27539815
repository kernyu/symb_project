Anti-biofilm activity of three anthocyanidins (pelargonidin, cyanidin and delphinidin) was evaluated for the first time at in vitro conditions. All the compounds reduced the formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 biofilm at low sub-MIC (0.125 MIC) with delphinidin (c 56.25 mug/mL) being the most active (43%). In comparison, ampicillin (c 93.75 mug/mL) and streptomycin (c 21.25 mug/mL) (used as positive controls) were considerably less effective at the same sub-MIC (8 and 12%, respectively). Furthermore, at 0.5 MIC (c 225 mug/mL) this anthocyanidin molecule partly reduced the bacterial protrusions. However, no any of the aforementioned compounds inhibited the production of pyocyanin by the bacterial strain P. aeruginosa PAO1. Taken all together, the delphinidin scaffold could be taken into consideration for the design of the novel and more effective anti-biofilm agents inspired by the anthocyanidins.
