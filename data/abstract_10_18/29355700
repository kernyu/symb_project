Aeromonas are ubiquitous in aquatic habitats. However some species can cause infections in humans, but rarely meningitis. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of an Aeromonas strain from cerebrospinal fluid of a meningitis patient. The isolate, identified as A. trota by biochemical and molecular methods, was susceptible to ampicillin but resistant to cephalothin and cefazolin. Genome sequencing revealed virulence factor genes such as type VI secretion system, aerolysin and lateral flagella. The isolate exhibited swarming motility, hemolytic activity and adhesion and cytotoxicity on HeLa cells. This is the first report of A. trota associated with meningitis and its virulence characteristics.
