Antimicrobial resistance is a major concern for UK healthcare professionals, following growing evidence of multi-resistant pathogens. Poor prescribing practices, partly driven by patient demand, and poor patient adherence to prescribed regimens are two of the causes of growing antimicrobial resisitance. Improved infection prevention and control practices will not only reduce healthcare-acquired infections, but also reduce the necessity for antimicrobials. Community nurses can also support their clients to promote their own health and wellbeing, increasing resilience to infections through a healthy lifestyle which includes a well-balanced diet, good personal hygiene and the take up of offered vaccinations.
