Avibactam displays potent inhibition of extended-spectrum, AmpC, KPC and some OXA beta-lactamases. We examined the combinations of avibactam with ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam by the broth microdilution method against Gram-negative bacteria harboring molecularly-characterized beta-lactamase genes collected in Toho University, Japan. Bacterial isolates included: Ambler class A beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (n = 26); class C beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (n = 9) and class D beta-lactamase-producing Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 9) and Enterobacteriaceae (n = 3). Ceftazidime-avibactam, ceftaroline-avibactam ands aztreonam-avibactam were active against the strains with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) or AmpC enzymes, but combination with avibactam did not reduce beta-lactam MICs against A. baumannii with OXA beta-lactamases including carbapenemases, such as OXA-40 and -69.
