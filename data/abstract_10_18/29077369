Febrile neutropenia is a common and potentially fatal complication of intense cytotoxic therapy, which makes it the main cause of non-relapse mortality in patients with hematologic malignancies. Some of the patients are at risk of specific infections due to underlying disease of previous treatment regimens. Considering that most febrile neutropenic patients can be diagnosed with sepsis, diagnosis and treatment should be treated as septic. It is important to recognize patients at high risk since the incidence of sepsis in neutropenic patients can be significantly reduced using antimicrobial prophylaxis and granulocyte growth factors. Once sepsis occurs, prompt treatment according to guidelines, individualized based on the specific problems of each patient, and microbiological situation can significantly reduce mortality and morbidity.
