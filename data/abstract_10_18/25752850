Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (SDSE) isolates are the most common group C streptococci in humans and reports of invasive infections associated with SDSE have been increasing. Molecular epidemiology studies are an important strategy to trace the emergence and spread of possible well-fit bacterial pathogens of humans and animals. In this work, we analysed the antimicrobial and clonal profiles of 115 SDSE infection and colonization isolates of human and equine origin. PFGE revealed the spread of two main clusters: clone A (57.4%) and clone A (26.1%). Remarkably, two isolates from clone B obtained from human colonization cases displayed identical PFGE patterns to those of three equine infection isolates. In addition, multilocus sequence typing allocated these isolates to ST129 (CC31). All of the SDSE isolates were susceptible to penicillin, vancomycin, gentamicin, levofloxacin and chloramphenicol. Tetracycline and erythromycin resistance rates were 65.2 and 13.9% respectively. Nevertheless, none of the isolates displaying sporadic PFGE patterns showed erythromycin resistance. The majority of erythromycin-resistant isolates from clone A had inducible resistance to macrolides, lincosamines and streptogramins B (iMLSB phenotype), which is associated with the presence of the ermA gene, whereas the resistant isolates from clone B showed the M phenotype, associated with the mefA gene. In conclusion, the data indicated that the analysed collection of SDSE isolates displayed a clonal structure and that the isolates found in human colonization cases could also be involved in equine infections.
