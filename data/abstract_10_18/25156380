Infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa are a major health problem, especially for immune-compromised and cystic fibrosis patients, owing to the particular drug resistance of the microorganism. The aim of this review is to provide recent insights into strategies under investigation for prevention and therapy of these infections. In this survey, the approach directed against bacterial biofilm formation and quorum-sensing systems was focused, along with the evaluation of the treatment with bacteriophages. New interesting, developmental studies and clinical trials to prevent or treat infections due to this opportunistic pathogen are based on active and passive immunotherapy. Some monoclonal antibodies and different vaccines against this microorganism have been developed in the last few decades, even though to date none of them have obtained market authorization.
