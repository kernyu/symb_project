BACKGROUND: Combination therapies have gained momentum in the disease management strategies of various indications. While it is challenging and more time consuming to develop a combined analytical method, the strategy of simultaneous analysis offers significant advantages in terms of efficiency and cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: Due to a significant difference in efficacious dose for ceftazidime and avibactam, the calibration ranges validated in this paper were set to 0.05-50 mug/ml for ceftazidime and 0.005-5.0 mug/ml for avibactam. Interday results of ceftazidime were within 8% for accuracy and 9% for precision and within 9% for both accuracy and precision of avibactam. CONCLUSION: A sensitive and selective LC-MS/MS method was developed for the simultaneous quantification of ceftazidime and avibactam in rat plasma.
