Cidofovir is a deoxycytidine monophosphate analog with broad spectrum activity against various deoxyribonucleic acid viruses. Cidofovir is marketed as an injectable for intravenous use; however, there is a topical cidofovir formulation utilized for viral dermatologic infections. Here, we present a case of a successful clearance of a perianal acyclovir resistant and foscarnet refractory herpes simplex virus (HSV1) ulcer in a 34 year-old woman who had undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. After 1 week of therapy with cidofovir gel, the patient's ulcer was clinically improved, and the lesion was negative for herpes simplex virus transcripts by real-time polymerase chain reaction testing. The wound remained herpes simplex virus negative by real-time polymerase chain reaction on repeat testing 1 week later. Based on this and other reports in HIV/AIDS patients, we believe that cidofovir gel has utility in the management of cutaneous, acyclovir-resistant HSV infections.
