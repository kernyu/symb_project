Leishmaniasis has recently garnered attention as one of the diseases 'most neglected' by drug research and development, as the current therapeutic modalities available for the patients are ridden with unacceptable toxicity due to high dosage of the drug, prolonged treatment schedules, resistance and prohibitive costs. A successful chemotherapy requires a restoration of immune response; therefore, we combined Leishmania-specific 78 kDa antigen (with or without adjuvant MPL-A) along with a novel drug cisplatin in infected BALB/c mice and did its comparative analysis with chemotherapy and immunotherapy alone. Animals that were treated with immunochemotherapy showed maximum curative potential as demonstrated by a marked reduction in parasite load. Delayed-type hypersensitivity response to leishmanial antigens has been widely used to assess the level of host protection to the disease. An increased delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response was observed in animals given immunotherapy or chemotherapy or immunochemotherapy; however, maximum DTH response was observed in animals treated with cisplatin + 78 kDa + MPL-A. These animals were also found to exhibit higher IgG2a levels greater cytokine (IFN-gamma and IL-2) concentrations suggesting the generation of a strong Th1 type of immune response which is responsible for resolution of the disease.
