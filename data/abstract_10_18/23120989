It has been shown that bacteria of the genus Bacillus inhibited the development of infection caused by Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis, in tomatoes. Pre-sowing seed treatment with suspensions of Bacillus subtilis IMV B-7023 and Bacillus pumilus 3 enhanced resistance of plants to bacterial disease of cancer, probably due to the synthesis of biologically active substances with antimicrobial properties by these bacteria. Of the two strains of bacillus, differing by antagonist properties to C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis, a significant stimulating effect on the growth and development of tomatoes was provided by the strain B. subtilis IMV B-7023, which is part of the bacterial preparations for crop production.
