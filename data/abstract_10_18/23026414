BACKGROUND: Susceptibility testing of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is traditionally performed by a plaque reduction assay (PRA), but this is labor intensive, time consuming and has a manual read out. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to develop an internally controlled real time PCR-based phenotypical susceptibility test for HSV-1 that is suitable for use in a clinical diagnostic setting. STUDY DESIGN: A DNA reduction assay (DRA) was developed and validated on a test panel of 26 well-characterized isolates of varying susceptibility to aciclovir or foscarnet, including low-level resistant isolates. The DRA consisted of pre-culture of a clinical sample for 48 h and subsequent culture in the presence of antivirals for 24 h. Viral DNA concentration in the culture lysates was measured by an internally controlled quantitative real-time HSV-1 PCR and corrected for cell count and lysis by beta-globin PCR. DRA results were compared to results from PRA and sequence analysis. RESULTS: DRA results were in accordance with PRA results for both aciclovir and foscarnet susceptibility and appeared to have good discriminative value for low-level resistance due to UL30 gene mutations. Although the direct application of DRA in clinical samples appeared not possible, short pre-culture of 48 h was sufficient and ensured results within a clinically relevant time frame of 5 days. CONCLUSIONS: DRA is an accurate, rapid and easy to perform phenotypical susceptibility test for HSV-1.
