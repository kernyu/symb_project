Acinetobacter baumannii ventriculitis/meningitis due to the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains has become a clinical entity of considerable importance in recent years. A review of the available literature regarding intraventricular (IVT) or intrathecal (ITH) administration of colistin in MDR and XDR A. baumannii ventriculitis/meningitis was conducted and a total of 83 episodes in 81 patients were identified (71 cases in adults and 10 in children and neonates). Colistin was administered via the IVT and ITH route in 52 and 22 cases, respectively, whilst in 7 cases the exact route was not identified. The median dose of local colistin was 125000 IU (10mg) with a range of 20000 IU (1.6 mg) to 500000 IU (40 mg) in adults, whilst a dose of 2000 IU/kg (0.16 mg/kg) up to 125000 IU (10mg) was used in the paediatric population. The median duration of treatment of IVT/ITH polymyxin E was 18.5 days, whilst the median time to achieve sterilisation of cerebrospinal fluid was 4 days. The rate of successful outcome was 89%, and toxicity related to treatment mainly manifested as reversible chemical ventriculitis/meningitis was reported in nine cases (11%). Nowadays, IVT and ITH colistin represents the last resort treatment of MDR and XDR A. baumannii ventriculitis/meningitis, offering a unique, rather safe and successful mode of therapy.
