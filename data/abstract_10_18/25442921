Fungal infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and are frequently associated with the implantation of vascular catheters, especially in immune-compromised patients. Unfortunately, the therapeutic arsenal available for the treatment of these infections, caused generally by the yeasts of the genus Candida is still limited because of the toxicity and/or of the emergence of resistance against some antifungal agents. That is why we have undertaken this study, which is to determine the incidence and the degree of sensitivity of Candida spp., isolated from peripheral venous catheters at the University Hospital of Tlemcen (Algeria) to caspofungin and amphotericin B. The results show that the rate of colonization of vascular catheters was 19 % by yeasts of Candida spp., of which 60 % are Candida parapsilosis, 20 % Candida albicans, 14.3 % Candida glabrata and 5.7 % Candida famata. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for amphotericin B are between 0.5 and 2 mug/mL and for caspofungin, they are between 0.125 and 2 mug/mL.
