The aim of this study was to evaluate, in a commercial feedlot, the effect of different anthelmintic drugs on the productivity of naturally infected calves from a cow-calf operation, where resistance to ivermectin (IVM) has been previously detected. The study began with the random selection of 80 calves whose weight was 132 +/- 12 kg. Four groups were made: IVM, ricobendazole (RBZ), ricobendazole plus levamisol (RBZ + LEV) and a control group (CG) without treatment. On days 0, 21, 42, 70, 98 and 126, manual collection of fecal matter and individual weight were registered. Mixed SAS procedure was used for statistical analysis. The percentages of fecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) calculated 21 days post treatment (PT) were 18%, 96% and 100% for the IVM, RBZ and RBZ + LEV groups, respectively. Body weight (+/- SEM) at the end of the trial was 266 kg (+/- 0.9), 269 kg (+/- 1.1), 276 kg (+/- 1.3), 280 kg (+/- 1.9) for CG, IVM, RBZ and RBZ + LEV groups, respectively. The effect on live weight was highly significant (p < 0001). After 126 days of fattening, the deleterious effect of the combination of Cooperia and Haemonchus in the IVM group on body weight was evident. Undetected animals carrying anthelmintic resistant (AR) worms entering the feedlot, could cause major productivity losses.
