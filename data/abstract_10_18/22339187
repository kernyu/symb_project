Peramivir (BioCryst Pharmaceuticals) is a novel investigational intravenous neuraminidase inhibitor that exhibits potent antiviral activity against influenza A and B viruses. Peramivir is created by a structure-based drug design and consists of a cyclopentane backbone with a positively charged guanidinyl group and lipophilic side chains. Peramivir was made available in the USA through the Emergency Investigational New Drug regulations and under an Emergency Use Authorization for hospitalized patients with known or suspected influenza during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. In trials involving ambulatory adult subjects, intravenous peramivir is safe and has a pharmacokinetic profile that supports once-daily dosing. The drug is licensed in Japan and South Korea and is currently undergoing Phase III trials in the USA. Viral resistance mechanisms to peramivir have not been fully delineated and ongoing surveillance is important. Given the serious health threat of influenza at all ages and limitations in vaccine delivery, peramivir is a promising addition to the currently limited treatment options for the treatment of severe influenza infection.
