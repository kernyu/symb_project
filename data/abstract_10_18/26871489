This study aimed to report the presence of parasites resistant to the most used anthelmintic drugs in sheep in Colombia. Four farms (denominated farm 1, 2, 3 and 4) were selected where the animals were not treated with anthelmintics for two months before the trial. Animals with faecal egg count (FEC) above 150 and of different ages were allocated into six groups, each consisting of at least 5 animals. The drugs and dosages used were: ivermectin 1% (0.2 mg/kg), albendazole 25% (5 mg/kg), fenbendazole 10% (5 mg/kg), levamisole 10% (5 mg/kg), and moxidectin 1% (0.2 mg/kg). Anthelmintic efficacy was determined by the FEC reduction test (FECRT) with a second sampling 14 days post-treatment. The efficacy of albendazole and fenbendazole at farm 1 was above 95%, which was different from the others farms. The FECRT indicated the presence of multidrug resistance in the other farms where no tested drugs showed activity higher than 79% (albendazole: 0 to 55%, fenbendazole: 51.4 to 76.6%, ivermectin: 67.3 to 93.1%, levamisole: 0 to 78.1%, and moxidectin: 49.2 to 64.1%).Haemonchus contortus was the predominant (96%) species, followed by a small presence of Trichostrongylus sp. (3%) andCooperia sp. (1%). Therefore, we report for the first time the existence of multiple anthelmintic resistance in gastrointestinal nematodes of sheep in Colombia.
