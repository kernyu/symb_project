Excepting tropical Africa, where Plasmodium falciparum prevails, Plasmodium vivax is the most frequent cause of malaria in Asia and Latin America. First reliable reports of chloroquine resistance came in 1989 from the area of the distribution of the Chesson-strain of P. vivax. Since then, reports also came from other areas of the world. This study had the objective of measuring the sensitivity of P.vivax to chloroquine and potential alternative compounds in western Thailand. The study was performed in 2008 in Mae Sot, Tak Province, and followed the method of Tasanor. The IC(50) and IC(90) values for chloroquine were 167 nM and 5445 nM, those for mefloquine were 139 nM and 5282 nM, those for artemisinin were 32 nM and 466 nM, and those for atovaquone 30 nM and 650 nM. The values for chloroquine indicate the existing or imminent occurrence of specific resistance. High prevalence of mefloquine resistance precludes its alternative use. However, atovaquone, in combination with proguanil, may be a possible alternative.
