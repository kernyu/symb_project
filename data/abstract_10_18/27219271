Tigecycline is one of the few therapeutic options that are available for treating serious clinical infections. However, tigecycline nonsusceptible Enterobacteriaceae has emerged recently in China. In this study, a total of 28 clinical Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates that were not previously exposed to tigecycline were collected and confirmed for tigecycline minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) using standard broth microdilution tests. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying molecular resistance to tigecycline, the expression levels of efflux pumps AcrAB and OqxAB and their regulators RamA, MarA, RarA, and SoxS were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The expression levels of the genes acrB, ramA, marA, and soxS were statistically different in different MIC groups (p < 0.05). Sequence analysis of the acrR and ramR genes revealed several nonsynonymous mutations in the nine resistance isolates. The values of MIC in these isolated strains with ramR mutations were significantly higher than those without ramR mutation (p = 0.029). Moreover, mutations in the ramR gene led to the overexpression of RamA. These results indicated that the mutation of the ramR gene through the upregulated expression of RamA contributed to tigecycline resistance and that several of the newly identified types of mutations in ramR and acrR were not previously reported in K. pneumoniae clinical isolates.
