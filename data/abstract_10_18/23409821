Emergences of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (CRGNB) have heightened global awareness of the prioritization of infection prevention and control (IPC) interventions to minimize infections attributed to these bacteria. Effective new antibiotic drugs for CRGNB are estimated to be at least 5 years off completion of trials and approval for use. Hence, effective IPC strategies remain at the core of clinical care and research for patients with CRGNB infection. The authors summarize current evidence and viewpoints for IPC strategies as related to the emergence, transmission and prevention of CRGNB.
