BACKGROUND: Dolutegravir is a powerful, well-tolerated integrase inhibitor with a high genetic barrier to resistance and may thus constitute the backbone of lightened regimens. METHODS: This was a monocentric, retrospective study. HIV-1-infected patients receiving dolutegravir as monotherapy (mDGV) or dual therapy (dDGV) were systematically identified. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who maintained undetectable (<50 copies/mL) plasma HIV RNA [plasma viral load (PVL)]. RESULTS: We identified 21 patients on mDGV (50 mg/day) and 31 on dDGV (50 or 100 mg/day, with atazanavir +/- ritonavir, n = 12; rilpivirine, n = 11; maraviroc, n = 3; lamivudine, n = 3; darunavir/ritonavir, n = 1; or abacavir, n = 1). All of the patients were treatment experienced and 48% had experienced at least one virological failure. The baseline characteristics were as follows (for the mDGV/dDGV patients, respectively): 5%/29% had a history of AIDS; the median (IQR) highest PVL was 4.5 (4.3-5.5)/5.3 (4.7-5.6) log copies/mL; the median (IQR) nadir CD4+ count was 310 (280-468)/199 (134-281) cells/mm(3); 100% had undetectable PVL before the mDGV for a median (IQR) duration of 5.9 (3.5-9.9) years/81% had undetectable PVL before the dDGV for a median (IQR) duration of 3.7 (1.4-8.3) years; and the median (IQR) HIV DNA level was 2.7 (2.1-3.1)/2.9 (2.7-3) log copies/10(6) PBMCs. At the last follow-up visit, 100% and 97% of patients showed undetectable PVL following mDGV and dDGV, respectively [median (IQR) follow-up of 32 (29-45) and 50 (30-74) weeks, respectively]. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, dolutegravir-based lightened regimens provided a high proportion of viral suppression, even in highly treatment-experienced patients.
