Two devastating cases of multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa endophthalmitis after keratoplasty as the result of transmission from the same donor were confirmed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Strategies for preventing donor-to-host transmission, such as the use of antimicrobial agents of greater efficacy and better methods for detecting microorganisms in preservation medium, could minimize this type of transmission.
