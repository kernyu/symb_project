Rapid-screening methods to confirm the presence of resistance mechanisms in multidrug-resistant bacteria are currently recommended. Carba NP and Blue-Carba tests were evaluated in carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae from hospital (n = 102) and environmental (n = 57) origins for detecting the different molecular classes among them. Both methods showed to be fast and cost-effective, with high sensitivity (98% to 100%) and specificity (100%), and may be easily introduced in the routine laboratory.
