AIM: To assess the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) (blaTEM, blaSHV, and blaCTX-M) genes in Escherichia coli isolated from chicken meat, chevon meat, raw milk, and human urine and stool samples collected from tribal districts of Chhattisgarh, viz., Jagdalpur, Dantewada, Kondagaon, and Kanker. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 330 samples, comprising 98 chicken meat, 82 chevon meat, 90 raw milk, and 60 human urine and stool samples, were processed for isolation of E. coli. Isolates were confirmed biochemically and further tested against commonly used antibiotics to know their resistant pattern. The resistant isolates were tested for ESBL production by phenotypic method followed by characterization with molecular method using multiplex-polymerase chain reaction technique. RESULTS: Overall 57.87% (191/330) samples were found positive for E. coli, which include 66.32% (65/98) chicken meat, 46.34% (38/82) chevon meat, 81.11% (73/90) raw milk, and 25% (15/60) human urine and stool samples. Isolates showed the highest resistance against cefotaxime (41.36%) followed by oxytetracycline (34.03%), ampicillin (29.31%), cephalexin (24.60%), cefixime (16.75%), and ceftazidime (13.08%). Phenotypic method detected 10.99% (21/191) isolates as presumptive ESBL producers, however, molecular method detected 3.66% (7/191), 2.09% (4/191), and 0.00% (0/191) prevalence of blaTEM, blaCTX-M, and blaSHV, respectively. CONCLUSION: The present study indicates a high prevalence of E. coli in raw chicken meat, chevon meat, and milk due to poor hygienic practices. The antibiotic susceptibility test detected the presence of the resistance pattern against ESBL in E. coli isolated from raw chicken meat, chevon meat, milk, and also in human clinical samples is of great concern. The appearance of E. coli in the human food chain is alarming and requires adaptation of hygienic practices and stipulate use of antibiotics.
