The resistance of infectious bacteria to current antibiotics is a worldwide problem caused, partially, by the overuse of antimicrobials. The use of nanotechnology as an innovative tool against bacterial infections provides a range of methodologies to redesign old antibiotics for novel and remarkable new strategies. Thus, functionalized antibiotics present structures with improved bioavailability, low toxicity and specificity to bacterial membrane. In this context, this review will describe the use of nanotechnology as an innovative tool to functionalize antibiotics. In addition, the importance of the interdisciplinary context to understand, develop and apply these systems as an innovative tool for drug development and improvement is discussed.
