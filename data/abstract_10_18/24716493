Emergence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae has become a substantial global health problem. The aim of this study was to analyze carbapenem-resistant isolates of Enterobacter cloacae that have emerged for the first time in the intensive care unit (ICU) at the University Hospital Centre Split, Croatia. The strains were selected in the period between June and August 2012, according to their susceptibility patterns to carbapenems. Resistant isolates were screened for metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) production with the use of the imipenem-EDTA disk synergy test, and positive findings were confirmed by PCR. The type of VIM beta-lactamase gene was determined by sequencing of PCR products. The genetic relatedness was evaluated using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis. The demographic and clinical data were retrospectively analyzed from medical records. Five patients were infected and one patient was colonized with a single clone of multidrug-resistant VIM-1-producing E. cloacae susceptible only to colistin. Three cases of lower respiratory tract infections, one case of bacteremia, and one case of intra-abdominal infection were identified. All cases were hospital-acquired after prolonged stay in ICU. All patients had serious underlying diseases and received a broad-spectrum antibiotic. Four patients died and two had unimprovable medical condition at the time of discharge from the hospital. MBL-producing E. cloacae can cause fatal infection in severely ill patients. Monoclonal outbreak highlights the need for continuous surveillance and good infection control practices to prevent further spread since the antibiotic therapy options for infections caused by such strains are strongly limited.
