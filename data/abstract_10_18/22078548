OBJECTIVE: To characterize meningococcal strains isolated from five cases of meningococcal disease (MD) associated with an outbreak in Trancoso - BA, occurred in October 2009. All cases, with the exception of a 39-year-old male, attended a dance party with approximately 1000 youngsters in a rural site. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The epidemiological investigation was conducted by the Epidemiological Surveillance Service of Bahia State. Meningococcal strains were characterized at Adolfo Lutz Institute, the Brazilian National Reference Laboratory for Bacterial Meningitis by conventional techniques (serotype, serosubtype and antimicrobial susceptibility test) and by molecular methods (Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis - PFGE and Multilocus Sequence Typing - MLST). RESULTS: The PFGE showed 2 closely related restriction profiles, designated as PFGE types A and A1, having 92% relatedness to each other. MLST characterization showed both A and A1 clones were ST-3780, which belongs to the ST-103 complex. All isolates displayed the phenotype C:23:P1.5 and were susceptible to all antibiotics tested. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported MD outbreak associated with serogroup C ST-103 complex in Brazil, as well as the party and illicit drug-use associated outbreak.
