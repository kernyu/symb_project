Antimicrobial resistance is a serious threat and compromises the management of infectious disease. This has particular significance in relation to infections of the respiratory tract, which are the lead cause of antibiotic prescribing. Education is fundamental to the correct use of antibiotics. A novel open access curriculum has been developed in the context of a European Union funded research project Genomics to combat Resistance against Antibiotics in Community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections in Europe (GRACE http://www.grace-lrti.org). The curriculum was developed in modular format and populated with clinical and scientific topics relevant to community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections. This curriculum informed the content of a series of postgraduate courses and workshops and permitted the creation of an open access e-Learning portal. A total of 153 presentations matching the topics within the curriculum together with slide material and handouts and 104 webcasts are available through the GRACE e-Learning portal, which is fully searchable using a 'mindmap' to navigate the contents. Metrics of access provided a means for assessing usage. The GRACE project has permitted the development of a unique on-line open access curriculum that comprehensively addresses the issues relevant to community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections and has provided a resource not only for personal learning, but also to support independent teaching activities such as lectures, workshops, seminars and course work.
