BACKGROUND: The clinical experience with colistin therapy for multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens in solid organ transplantation is limited. METHODS: Patients transplanted from January 2003 to July 2011 and treated with intravenous or nebulized colistin were included. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize patients' characteristics and Kaplan-Meier curves for survival analysis. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were included: 10 adults (median age, 54.6 y; range, 32.2-79.6 y) and 5 children (median age, 3.3 y; range, 1.1-10.4 y). Eight patients had intra-abdominal infections, 3 had pneumonia, and 4 had bacteremia. The infections were diagnosed at a median of 5.9 months (range, 0.8-49.8 mo) after transplantation. Eight patients had coinfections, mainly with enteric pathogens. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated in 13 cases and ESBL Klebsiella oxytoca and ESBL Escherichia coli were isolated in 1 case each. Thirteen patients received concomitant antibiotics with colistin. The median dose of intravenous colistin (13 patients) was 2.7 mg/kg/d (range, 1-4.9 mg/kg/d) and nebulized colistin (2 patients) was 241.7 mg/d (range, 150-333.3 mg/d). Clinical cure was achieved in 9 patients (60%). Four-week survival rate after infection was 86.7% (95% confidence interval, 56.4%-96.5%). There was no difference in the median creatinine clearance in adults (P = .38) or children (P = .88) before and after colistin. One patient had both neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, and 1 patient had neurotoxicity only. CONCLUSIONS: Colistin might be used as an alternate therapy for transplant patients with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens.
