Here we report the molecular epidemiology of macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococci, GAS) isolated from children with pharyngotonsillitis between 2011 and 2013 in Japan. In 299 isolates, 124 (41.5%) isolates were macrolide-resistant. We characterized the isolates by emm typing, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Of 299 isolates, 124 (41.5%) were macrolide-resistant isolates, 76 (61.3%) possessed mefA and 46 (37.1%) possessed ermB. All 76 isolates with mefA possessed msrD. There were no isolates possessed ermTR in this study. Eight emm/MLST types were observed. The predominant type was emm1/ST28 (57 isolates, 46.0%), which possessed the mefA/msrD complex, presenting as the M phenotype. The second most predominant type was emm12/ST467, which possessed ermB, presenting as the cMLSB phenotype. Of the cMLSB phenotype isolates, types emm28/ST52 and emm12/ST36 had multiple genetic backgrounds. We found high proportions of macrolide-resistant GAS in the southwestern areas of Japan.
