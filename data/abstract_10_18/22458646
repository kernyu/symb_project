Metritis, endometritis and pyometra are common uterus inflammatory diseases, occurring mainly in the early postpartum period of livestock and farm animals. These infections are primarily associated with contamination of the reproductive tract, in particular uterine. Uterine infections bring to uterine and cervical involution as well as sub-fertility; the high economic loss, due to costs for treatment, milk withdrawal, reduced reproductive performance and premature culling, clearly demonstrate that uterine health in the postpartum period requires substantial medical veterinary attention. A wide variety of therapies for endometritis have been reported, including mainly antibiotics administered either by systemic or local somministration. Here, the patent application WO/2011/132191, which describes an alternative treatment for uterine infection, using casein peptides, is evaluated and discussed.
