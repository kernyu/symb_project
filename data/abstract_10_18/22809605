OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence and drug resistance of extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases (ESBLs)-producing bacteria in blood culture isolated from children with hematological malignancy after chemotherapy. METHODS: Blood samples taken from 3264 children with hematological malignancy and severe infection following chemotherapy between 2002 and 2008 were cultured using the Bact/ALTER 3D blood culture system. VITEK 60 automicroscan was used to identify viral species and to conduct drug resistance tests. The results were indentified according to National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standard guidelines. RESULTS: Fifty-eight strains of Escherichia coli and fifty-one strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae were isolated. Thirty-eight strains of Escherichia coli and nineteen strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae were ESBLs-producing and these ESBLs-producing strains were less susceptible than those that were non-ESBLs-producing to most antibiotics. Both ESBL- and non-ESBL-producing strains were susceptible to imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam and amikacin. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of ESBLs-producing bacteria is high in childrn with hematological malignancy and infection following chemotherapy. ESBLs-producing bacteria are resistant to common antibiotics, suggesting that antibiotic treatment based on the result of antimicrobial susceptibility test is necessary in these children.
