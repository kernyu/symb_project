BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Almost round-the-year occurrence of Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi A has been noticed in Rourkela since last 13 and five years respectively. The incidence of infection along with the antibiogram of these two serotypes in this area were carried out. METHODS: The study was carried out at Ispat General Hospital, Rourkela, India, between January 2005 and December 2008 with 5340 blood samples collected from patients with suspected enteric fever and pyrexia of unknown origin. Isolation, identification and antibiogram of the causative organisms were performed according to standard bacteriological procedures. RESULTS: A total of 298 Salmonella isolates showed an overall per cent positivity of 5.58. Multidrug resistance was found in 11.96 per cent and 15.62 per cent isolates of S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A respectively. Less than 2 per cent isolates of Salmonella showed resistance to ciprofloxacin. A resistance of 3.0 to 6.25 per cent against third generation cephalosporins was observed among the salmonella isolates. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: A round-the-year occurrence of Salmonella spp. in Rourkela might have been due to the presence of a considerable number of carriers in the locality, poor sanitation in nearby slum areas, and inadequate and contaminated community water supply at times. Higher degree of susceptibility among S. Typhi isolates against various antibiotics was encouraging, but increasing trend of resistance observed among S. Paratyphi A isolates was a matter of concern.
