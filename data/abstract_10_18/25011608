Metal oxide materials have been widely used as gas-sensing platforms, and their sensing performances are largely dependent on the morphology and surface structure. Here, freestanding flower-like Co3O4 nanostructures supported on three-dimensional (3D) carbon foam (Co3O4@CF) were successfully synthesized by a facile and low-cost hydrothermal route and annealing procedure. The morphology and structure of the nanocomposites were studied by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The SEM characterizations showed that the skeleton of the porous carbon foam was fully covered by flower-like Co3O4 nanostructures. Moreover, each Co3O4 nanoflower is composed of densely packed nanoneedles with a length of ~10 mum, which can largely enhance the surface area (about 286.117 m(2)/g) for ethanol sensing. Gas sensor based on the as-synthesized 3D Co3O4@CF nanostructures was fabricated to study the sensing performance for ethanol at a temperature range from 180 to 360 degrees C. Due to the 3D porous structure and the improvement in sensing surface/interface, the Co3O4@CF nanostructure exhibited enhanced sensing performance for ethanol detection with low resistance, fast response and recovery time, high sensitivity, and limit of detection as low as 15 ppm at 320 degrees C. The present study shows that such novel 3D metal oxide/carbon hybrid nanostructures are promising platforms for gas sensing.
