Lipid-induced insulin resistance is associated with inflammatory state in epidemiological studies. However, it is still unclear whether the activation of NF-kappaB, a pivotal transcription factor of inflammation, plays a crucial role in mediating skeletal muscle insulin resistance. This study addressed what was the role of NF-kappaB in lipid-induced insulin resistance and whether NF-kappaB activation was sufficient to cause insulin resistance in C2C12 myotubes. A 16 h exposure of myotubes to palmitate reduced net insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by 48%, GLUT4 translocation by 52%, Akt phosphorylation by 54%, induced a 1.8-fold increase in insulin-stimulated insulin receptor substrate (IRS) phosphorylation, and doubled NF-kappaB activation. Myotubes transfected with NF-kappaB p65 siRNA for 24 h and followed by a treatment with palmitate for 16 h efficiently blocked NF-kappaB activation, and prevented the detrimental effects of palmitate on the metabolic actions of insulin. Transfection of myotubes with I-kappaBalpha siRNA for 24 h also led to a twofold induction of NF-kappaB activation, and reduced net insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by 30%, GLUT4 translocation by 35%, Akt phosphorylation by 31%, induced a 0.7-fold increase in insulin-stimulated IRS phosphorylation. These findings suggest that NF-kappaB overexpression per se is sufficient to impair insulin sensitivity and palmitate-induced insulin resistance is mediated by NF-kappaB in skeletal muscle cells.
