BACKGROUND: Treatment failure of antiretroviral therapy in HIV-1 infection is increasing due to development of viral resistance. Trends of resistance-associated mutation lead to the ineffective treatment in HIV-infected individuals. METHODS: Extracted viral RNA from HIV-infected subjects in 2009 to 2010 was performed. The genotypic resistance testing was investigated for HIV-1 drug resistance in RT and PR genes. Frequencies of mutation were compared by a Fischer's exact test. RESULTS: Three hundred and sixty-nine samples (147 in 2009 and 222 in 2010) were genotyped. At least one mutation was found in 90.8% (335/369) in PR gene and 87.0% (321/369) in RT gene. Three sequences in PR gene, M36I, H69K, and L90M, were decreased significantly in 2010 when compared to 2009. Mutations associated with resistance to nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI's) were found in 61.0% and 64.2% in nonnucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI's). A total of 49.6% was found in combined NRTI and NNRTI. In 2010, M41L was increased significantly from 7.5% to 14.9%. However, there was a decrease in the frequency of the mutations at position 67, 70, and 184 between 2009 and 2010. CONCLUSIONS: In 2010, three mutations in PR gene, M36I, H69K, and L90M, were decreased significantly. However, only one mutation in RT gene, M41L was significantly increased.
