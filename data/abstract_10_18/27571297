The contemporary management of infectious diseases is built around antimicrobial therapy. However, the development of antimicrobial resistance threatens to create a post-antibiotic era. Antimicrobial stewardship attempts to reduce the development of antimicrobial resistance by improving their appropriate use. Osteopathic manipulative treatment as an adjunctive treatment has the potential for enhancing antimicrobial stewardship by enhancing the human immune system, shortening the duration of antimicrobial therapy, reducing complications, and improving treatment outcomes. The present article reviews the evidence published in the literature since this unique treatment approach was first developed more than 100 years ago. The evidence suggests that adjunctive osteopathic manipulative treatment has great potential for enhancing antimicrobial stewardship and should be further investigated.
