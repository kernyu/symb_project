Antibiotic-resistance by bacteria is a growing global concern within the healthcare field, and it has provided an impetus for continued antimicrobial development. Pyrinezolid (PZ), a novel oxazolidinone compound, can effectively inhibit most gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE). Though PZ is a promising antimicrobial candidate, the druggability of PZ is limited by its poor water solubility. Therefore, the amphipathic mPEG-PLLA copolymer was used to prepare the pyrinezolid micelles (PZ-M). Herein, we described the preparation, pharmacokinetic properties, tissue distribution, efficacy and toxicity of PZ-M. In vivo studies show that PZ-M possess prolonged blood circulation time and increased oral bioavailability compared with free PZ. Meanwhile, PZ-M increase lung PZ exposure and reduce liver and kidney exposure, which indicates that PZ-M may enhance the efficacy in vivo in MRSA-related pneumonia patients and decrease potential renal and hepatic toxicities.
