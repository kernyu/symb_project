BACKGROUND: Regimen selection for highly treatment-experienced patients is complicated. METHODS: Using a web-based utility, study team members reviewed antiretroviral (ARV) history and resistance data and recommended individual ARV regimens and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) options for treatment-experienced participants consisting of 3-4 of the following agents: raltegravir (RAL), darunavir (DRV)/ritonavir, tipranavir (TPV)/ritonavir, etravirine (ETR), maraviroc (MVC), and enfuvirtide (ENF). We evaluated team recommendations and site selection of regimen and NRTIs. Associations between baseline factors and the selection of a complex regimen (defined as including four ARV agents or ENF) were explored with logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 413 participants entered the study. Participants initiated the first or second recommended regimen 86% of the time and 21% of participants started a complex regimen. In a multivariable model, ARV resistance to NRTI (odds ratio [OR] = 2.2), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI, OR = 6.2) or boosted protease inhibitor (PI, OR = 6.6), prior use of integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI, OR = 25), and race-ethnicity (all P </= 0.01) were associated with selection of a complex regimen. Black non-Hispanic (OR = 0.5) and Hispanic participants from the continental US (OR = 0.2) were less likely to start a complex regimen, compared to white non-Hispanics. CONCLUSIONS: In this multi-center trial, we developed a web-based utility that facilitated treatment recommendations for highly treatment-experienced patients. Drug resistance, prior INSTI use, and race-ethnicity were key factors in decisions to select a more complex regimen.
