A carbapenemase-producing colistin-resistant Klebsiella oxytoca isolate was recovered from a blood culture of a female patient without previous report of risk factors to obtain multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli. A combination of biochemical and molecular methods was used to identify the resistance mechanism of this isolate. Carbapenemase production was mediated by Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase (VIM)-2. Colistin resistance was not due to plasmid- borne mcr-1 gene, but we found an integration of IS5-like sequence in the mgrB gene of K. oxytoca. This gene is known to be an important regulator of the PhoPQ two-component system, and the disruption of this gene is most likely the cause of lipid A modification resulting in colistin resistance of our isolate. To the best of our knowledge this constitutes the first report of a carbapenemase-producing K. oxytoca with colistin resistance, a case that demonstrates the limited treatment options for infections with multidrug-resistant organisms.
