OBJECTIVES AND AIMS: Escherchia coli isolated, from urine samples were studied for their antibiotic susceptibility patterns, with special reference to the new antimicrobial compound fosfomycin and their correlation with various virulence factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The mid stream urine samples received in the department were processed and identification was done by using the standard culture and identification techniques. The antibiotic susceptibility testing was done by modified Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion and the disk diffusion method was used to confirm the ESBL, AmpC, MBL production by the UPEC. Various virulence factors like hemolysin, haemagglutinaton, gelatinase, siderophore production, biofilm formation, serum resistance and hydrophobicity were detected. RESULTS: Fosfomycin was found to be most effective agent (100%) against uropathogenic E.coli followed by netilmicin (89.5%). The least effective agents were ampiciilin and cotrimoxazole. Twenty nine percent (29%) isolates were found to be multi drug resistant (MDR). CONCLUSIONS: The testing of the newer therapeutic agents like fosfomycin will add on to therapeutics for UTI's.
