BACKGROUND: Obesity-associated insulin resistance (IR) is highly correlated with soluble tumor necrosis factor-alpha (sTNF-alpha), which is released from transmembranous TNF-alpha by TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE). In vivo, TACE activity is suppressed by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3). Agents that can interact with TACE/TIMP3 to improve obesity-related IR would be highly valuable. In the current study, we assessed whether (2S,3R,4S)-4-hydroxyisoleucine (4-HIL) could modulate TACE/TIMP3 and ameliorate an obesity-induced IR-like state in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated in the presence of 25 mM glucose and 0.6 nM insulin to induce an IR-like state, and were then treated with different concentrations of 4-HIL or 10 microM pioglitazone (positive control). The glucose uptake rate was determined using the 2-deoxy-[(3)H]-D-glucose method, and the levels of sTNF-alpha in the cell supernatant were determined using ELISA. The protein expression of TACE, TIMP3, and insulin signaling-related molecules was measured using western blotting. RESULTS: Exposure to high glucose and insulin for 18 hours increased the levels of sTNF-alpha in the cell supernatant. The phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) Ser(307) and Akt Ser(473) was increased, whereas the protein expression of IRS-1, Akt, and glucose transporter-4 was decreased. The insulin-induced glucose uptake was reduced by 67% in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which indicated the presence of an IR-like state. The above indexes, which demonstrated the successful induction of an IR-like state, were reversed by 4-HIL in a dose-dependent manner by downregulating and upregulating the protein expression of TACE and TIMP3 proteins, respectively. CONCLUSION: 4-HIL improved an obesity-associated IR-like state in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by targeting TACE/TIMP3 and the insulin signaling pathway.
