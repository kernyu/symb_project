Fungal infections have become one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. Despite increased awareness and improved treatment strategies, the frequent development of resistance to the antifungal drugs used in clinical settings contributes to the increasing toll of mycoses. Although a natural phenomenon, antifungal drug resistance can compromise advances in the development of effective diagnostic techniques and novel antifungals. In this review, we will discuss the advent of cellular-micro- arrays, microfluidics, genomics, proteomics and other state-of-the art technologies in conquering antifungal drug resistance.
