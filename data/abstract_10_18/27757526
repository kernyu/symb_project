PURPOSE: To compare the antibiotic susceptibilities and visual acuity (VA) outcomes in endophthalmitis caused by methicillin-resistant (MRSA) versus methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). METHODS: The records of 34 cases of S. aureus endophthalmitis at The New York Eye and Ear Infirmary from Jan 1997 to June 2011 were reviewed. Antibiotic susceptibility profiles over time and VA at presentation and at 3, 6, and >/=12 months were recorded. S. aureus isolates were grouped based on oxacillin resistance. RESULTS: Of the 34 cases, 15 (44 %) were MRSA and 19 (56 %) MSSA. Median presenting VA was hand motions (logMAR 4.0) in both the MRSA and MSSA groups. There was no statistically significant difference in VA between the MRSA and MSSA groups at 3, 6, or >/=12 months. No MRSA isolates were resistant to vancomycin or gentamicin. While over 85 % of MRSA isolates tested for fourth-generation fluoroquinolones were resistant, just 10 % MSSA isolates tested were resistant. There was a trend suggesting an increase in the proportion of MRSA isolates compared to MSSA isolates over the course of the study period. CONCLUSIONS: There was no statistical difference in short- or long-term VA outcomes between the MRSA and MSSA groups at any time point. Resistance to fourth-generation fluoroquinolones was present in over 85 % of MRSA isolates, but just 10 % of MSSA isolates. An increasing proportion of MRSA amongst S. aureus isolates was noted over the course of the study period.
