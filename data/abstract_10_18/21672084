At present, colistin is among the few antibiotics effective against Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates. However, in the last few years, colistin-resistant A. baumannii strains have been isolated. Therefore, antibiotics effective against these usually pan-resistant colistin-resistant A. baumannii strains are required. The main objective of this study was to analyse the activity of 15 peptides against colistin-susceptible and colistin-resistant A. baumannii. The MICs were determined by microdilution. Among these 15 antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), melittin, indolicidin and mastoparan showed good activity against both colistin-susceptible and colistin-resistant A. baumannii. Further studies of mastoparan with time-killing curves showed bactericidal activity at MIC x8 for both colistin-susceptible and colistin-resistant A. baumannii. In conclusion, mastoparan may be a potential alternative for the treatment of colistin-resistant A. baumannii infections.
