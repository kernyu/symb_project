To test whether TB-BIOCHIP (MDR) test systems could be used at a hospital, a group of 107 subjects was identified, in whom the results of determining the resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid by the traditional culture-based method and the above test systems were compared. The findings showed that there was a high probability of coincidence of the results obtained by these two methods, but the microchip test permits analysis for 2 days as compared with the culture-based method performed for 12 weeks. Statistical data processing indicated that the coincidence of the results was significant and the confidence interval for coincidence probability (0.734, 0.929) counted in favor of the hospital use of microchips to determine and correct chemotherapy with essential antituberculous drugs.
