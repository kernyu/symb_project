Sporotrichosis is an emerging chronic, granulomatous, subcutaneous, mycotic infection caused by Sporothrix species. Sporotrichosis is treated with the azole drug itraconazole as ketoconazole is ineffective. It is a well-known fact that azole drugs act by inhibiting cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), heme-thiolate proteins. To date, nothing is known about P450s in Sporothrix schenckii and the molecular basis of its resistance to ketoconazole. Here we present genome-wide identification, annotation, phylogenetic analysis and comprehensive P450 family-level comparative analysis of S. schenckii P450s with pathogenic fungi P450s, along with a rationale for ketoconazole resistance by S. schenckii based on in silico structural analysis of CYP51. Genome data-mining of S. schenckii revealed 40 P450s in its genome that can be grouped into 32 P450 families and 39 P450 subfamilies. Comprehensive comparative analysis of P450s revealed that S. schenckii shares 11 P450 families with plant pathogenic fungi and has three unique P450 families: CYP5077, CYP5386 and CYP5696 (novel family). Among P450s, CYP51, the main target of azole drugs was also found in S. schenckii. 3D modeling of S. schenckii CYP51 revealed the presence of characteristic P450 motifs with exceptionally large reductase interaction site 2. In silico analysis revealed number of mutations that can be associated with ketoconazole resistance, especially at the channel entrance to the active site. One of possible reason for better stabilization of itraconazole, compared to ketoconazole, is that the more extended molecule of itraconazole may form a hydrogen bond with ASN-230. This in turn may explain its effectiveness against S. schenckii vis-a-vis resistant to ketoconazole.
