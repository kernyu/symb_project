In the present study, the serotype distribution and antibiotic resistance of S. pneumoniae from pediatric patients with upper respiratory infections in Beijing, 2010 were described. 140 pneumococcal isolates were obtained, and the prevailing five serotypes were 19F (18.6%), 23F (9.3%), 14 (9.3%), 15 (9.3%), and 6A (7.1%). The vaccine coverage of PCV7, PCV10, and PCV13 were 43.6%, 43.6%, and 60.0%, respectively. According to the CLSI 2010 criteria, 99.3% of the S. pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to penicillin. The resistance rates to erythromycin and azithromycin were 96.4% and 97.1%, respectively. Meanwhile, 64.3% (90/140) of all pneumococcal isolates were multidrug-resistant S. pneumoniae (MDRSP). PCV13 covered 68.9% (62/90) of MDRSP strains, whereas it was 47.8% (43/90) for PCV7. ErmB was the dominant macrolide-resistance gene, whereas 30.4% pneumococcal isolates expressed both ermB and mefA. No isolate expressed ermTR. The potential coverage of PCV13 is higher than PCV7 and PCV10 because high rates of serotypes 6A and 19A, and the conjugate vaccines could prevent the spread of MDRSP. S. pneumoniae is still sensitive to penicillin. The resistance rate of S. pneumoniae to macrolides is high and ermB is the dominant macrolide-resistance gene in China, so continued surveillance of the antimicrobial susceptibility of S. pneumoniae may be necessary.
