BACKGROUND: Campylobacter fetus infections usually occur in immunodepressed patients or patients presenting with diabetes mellitus or cancer. They rarely cause diarrhea but frequently cause bacteremia or vascular diseases. The therapeutic management is not well codified and fluoroquinolone resistance is continuously increasing. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of C. fetus infections from January 2007 to August 2013 at the Limoges teaching hospital. The infections were defined by at least 1 bacteriological sample positive for C. fetus. RESULTS: Twenty patients were included (15 men), with an average age of 73 years (43-91). Sixteen presented with cancer, 12 with solid cancer including 9 of the urinary tract, and 9 patients with hematologic diseases. Five patients presented with diabetes mellitus, 9 with isolated bacteremia, 3 with cellulitis, and 3 with septic arthritis. The diagnosis was made by blood cultures for 17 patients. Twenty percent of the isolates were resistant to amoxicillin and 30% to fluoroquinolones. The therapeutic regimens and the treatment duration were quite different. The outcome was unfavorable for 3 patients whose implanted port had not been removed and 1 with subdural hematoma infection. 1 patient died. CONCLUSIONS: C. fetus infection occurs in case of underlying diseases, most frequently promoting urinary tract cancer. Fluoroquinolones must not be used without susceptibility testing and catheters should be removed.
