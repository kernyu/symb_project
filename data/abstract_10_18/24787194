We report on the analysis of optical, polarimetric, and electrical properties of propolis films and hybrid biomaterial-inorganic heterojunctions based on them. It was shown that the material of the propolis films belongs to wide-bandgap optically active substances with the light-scattering centers, which possess complex optical properties. The values of the specific resistance rho(P)=1.9.10(7) Omega.cm and dielectric constant epsilon(P)=19.5 of the propolis film were determined from the spectral distribution of the real and imaginary components of its impedance at room temperature, respectively. The dominating current transport mechanisms through the hybrid bioinorganic heterojunction propolis/p-CdTe were established to be the interface-states-assisted generation-recombination within the depletion region via deep energy levels at forward bias as well as the leakage current through the shunt resistance at reverse bias.
