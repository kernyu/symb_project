Cytochrome bd is a terminal quinol oxidase of the bacterial respiratory chain. This tri-heme integral membrane protein generates a proton motive force at lower efficiency than heme-copper oxidases. This notwithstanding, under unfavorable growth conditions bacteria often use cytochrome bd in place of heme-copper enzymes as the main terminal oxidase. This is the case for several pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria during host colonization. This review summarizes recent data on the contribution of cytochrome bd to bacterial resistance to hydrogen peroxide, nitric oxide, and peroxynitrite, harmful species produced by the host as part of the immune response to microbial infections. Growing evidence supports the hypothesis that bd-type oxidases contribute to bacterial virulence by promoting microbial survival under oxidative and nitrosative stress conditions. For these reasons, cytochrome bd represents a protein target for the development of next-generation antimicrobials.
