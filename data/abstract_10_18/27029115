AIM: Characterize spectrum of antibiotics resistance of Acinetobacter baumannii strains, isolated from patients of 8 surgical and reanimation departments of 3 medical institution of Moscow, and determine molecular-genetic mechanisms of stability of their carbapenem-resistant forms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 95 strains of A. baumannii, isolated from patients of reanimation and surgical departments of Moscow in 2012-2014, were studied. Sensitivity of strains to antibiotics was tested phenotypically according to recommendations of EUCAST. The presence of VIM, IMP, OXA-23, OXA-40, OXA-48, OXA-58 and NDM genes in the studied strains was determined by polymerase chain reaction in real time. RESULTS: 86.3% of strains turnedout to be non-sensitive to carbapenems, sensitive--13.7%. 80.0% of strains were non-sensitive to gentamicin, 80.0% of strains--to netilmicin, 94.7% of strains--to ciprofloxacin 2.1%--to colistin. 91.6% of isolates have shown non-sensitivity to members of 2 and more classes of antibiotics, 78.9% of strains--to members of 3 classes. 2 strains were panresistant, 4.2% (4/95) of the isolates were sensitive to all the classes of antibiotics. Metallo-beta-lactamases were not detected. Genes of carbapenemases (OXA-23 and/or OXA-40) were detected in 85.3% (81/95) of strains, characterized phenotypically as non-sensitive to carbapenems. CONCLUSION: The results obtained shown an increase of resistance to carbapenems and multiple resistance in clinically significant strains of A. baumannii. Resistance to carbapenems is associated with OXA-23 and OXA-40 genes. The conclusions allow to justify perspectives of introduction of technologies of molecular-genetic testing of antibiotics resistance.
