BACKGROUND: Artesunate derivative drugs are newly introduced antimalaria drugs developed in response to the increasing drug resistance malaria spread. OBJECTIVE: To determine the parasitological resistance and the clinical failure to Artemether-Lumefantrin (Coartem); and artesunate plus sulfadoxine pyrimethamine (SP) by the WHO 14 day in vivo test. METHODS: The WHO 14 day in vivo efficacy study for coartem and artesunate with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine covered the period from Nov 28 to Dec. 26, 2006 with 141 patients of ages 2 - 35 years with uncomplicated malaria around the big hydroelectric power dam region of Gilgel Gibe II (GGII). There was close clinical follow up and included parasitic load and clearance. Packed red cell volume (Hematocrit) was measured at day 0 and 14. RESULTS: Parasitological resistance (RI, RII, RIII) to Coartem; and artesunate plus SP was not observed. There was no early as well as late clinical failure. All patients had adequate clinical response. The prevalence of malarial anemia (Hct < 33%) was 14.9% at day 0 and had decreased to 7.5% by day 14 in both groups. CONCLUSION: Coartem and artesunate with SP are highly efficacious in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in the GGII hydroelectric dam area.
