Resistance to linezolid (LZD) in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is due mainly to ribosomal mutations. We report on four CF patients with LZD-resistant MRSA bronchopulmonary infections by strains carrying the cfr gene. Strains from one patient also harbored the G2576U mutation (23S rRNA) and the G139R substitution (L3 protein). All strains belonged to the epidemic clone ST125 MRSA IVc. Our results support the monitoring of LZD resistance emergence in CF and non-CF MRSA isolates.
