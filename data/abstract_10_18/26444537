BACKGROUND: Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is increasing worldwide. Antibiotic-resistant strains can lead to serious problems regarding treatment of infection. Carbapenem antibiotics are the final treatment option for infections caused by serious and life-threatening multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria. Therefore, an understanding of carbapenem resistance is important for infection control. In the study described herein, the phenotypic and genotypic features of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae strains isolated in our hospital were evaluated. METHODS: In total, 43 carbapenem-resistant strains were included in this study. Sensitivity to antibiotics was determined using the VITEK((R))2 system. The modified Hodge test (MHT) and metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) antimicrobial gradient test were performed for phenotypic identification. Resistance genes IMP, VIM, KPC, NDM-1, and OXA-48 were amplified by multiplex PCR. RESULTS: The OXA-48 gene was detected in seven strains, and the NDM-1 gene in one strain. No resistance genes were detected in the remainder of strains. A significant correlation was observed between the MHT test and OXA-48 positivity, and between the MBL antimicrobial gradient test and positivity for resistance genes (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The finding of one NDM-1-positive isolate in this study indicates that carbapenem resistance is spreading in Turkey. Carbapenem resistance spreads rapidly and causes challenges in treatment, and results in high mortality/morbidity rates. Therefore, is necessary to determine carbapenem resistance in Enterobacteriaceae isolates and to take essential infection control precautions to avoid spread of this resistance.
