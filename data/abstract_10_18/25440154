Antimicrobial treatment of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR-AB) infections continues to pose significant challenges. With limited options, clinicians have been pushed towards using unorthodox combinations of licensed antibiotics. Although daptomycin/colistin combination appears to be a promising treatment option based on in vitro data, further preclinical work is needed. In this study, the A. baumannii-Galleria mellonella system was employed to study the in vivo efficacy of this combination in order to determine whether it should be explored further for the treatment of MDR-AB infections. The antimicrobial activity of colistin alone and in combination with daptomycin was assessed versus an A. baumannii type strain (ATCC 19606) and a MDR-AB clinical strain (GN2231) isolated in Anhui, China. Synergy studies were performed using the microtitre plate chequerboard assay and time-kill methodology. The in vivo activity of daptomycin/colistin combination was assessed using a G. mellonella larvae model. The combination of daptomycin and colistin was bactericidal against both strains tested. In chequerboard assays, daptomycin was highly active against A. baumannii when combined with colistin [fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) of <0.5]. Treatment of G. mellonella larvae infected with lethal doses of A. baumannii resulted in significantly enhanced survival rates when daptomycin was given with colistin compared with colistin treatment alone (P<0.05). This work suggests that daptomycin/colistin combination is highly active against A. baumannii both in vitro and in a simple invertebrate model of infection.
