Astrocytic Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) plays an important role not only in antiviral response but also in regeneration/healing of the CNS. The present study was undertaken to determine whether the neuroprotective effects of TLR3 signaling also include antioxidative protection. TLR3 ligation in human astrocytes induced protracted resistance of the cells to H(2)O(2) toxicity. Similar resistance was induced by conditioned medium from TLR3-ligated astrocytes indicating the involvement of paracrine signaling mechanisms. Out of 13 major antioxidative genes only the gene encoding superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) was postligationally upregulated suggesting that SOD2 is the major enzyme responsible for this protection.
