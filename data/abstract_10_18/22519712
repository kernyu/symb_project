Here, we demonstrate that the assembly of nanostructures with different dimensionalities yields "multicomponent hybrid" transparent conductive films (TCFs) with sheet resistance and optical transmittance comparable to that of indium tin oxide (ITO) films. It was shown that sheet resistance of single-component Ag nanowire (NW) films can be further decreased by introducing gold-decorated reduced graphene oxide (RG-O) nanoplatelets that bridge the closely located noncontacting metal NWs. RG-O nanoplatelets can act as a protective and adhesive layer for underneath metal NWs, resulting in better performance of hybrid TCFs compared to single-component TCFs. Additionally, these hybrid TCFs possess antibacterial properties, demonstrating their multifunctional characteristics that might have a potential for biomedical device applications. Further development of this strategy paves a way toward next generation TCFs composed of different nanostructures and characterized by multiple (or additional) functionalities.
