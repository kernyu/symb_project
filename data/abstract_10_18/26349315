The chemotherapy of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) has several limitations including resistance and toxicity of the existing drugs. Down regulation of immune system further aggravates the problems. To combat this situation we evaluated the leishmanicidal efficacy of Boerhaavia diffusa and Ocimum sanctum through oral route in L. donovani infection in BALB/c mice. Results have demonstrated maximum clearance of the parasites from infected animals treated with combination of B. diffusa and O. sanctum (@ 100 and 400 mg/kg body wt., respectively 5 days) as depicted through Leishman Donovan Units in liver. Up-regulation of cell-mediated immunity was also observed in animals of this group as heightened delayed type hypersensitivity responses and increased IgG2a levels were observed. Moreover, increased levels of SGOT, SGPT, serum urea, blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were brought down to normal levels. Since VL is associated immunosuppression, the above treatment is a good option as it helps in the up-regulation of Th1 responses and reduction in parasite load in L. donovani infected mice. These findings suggest a new option for antileishmanial chemotherapy at lower cost and nil toxicity.
