We identified one clinical isolate of K. pneumoniae harboring the mcr 1 (plasmid of IncX4 family) and blaKPC-2 (plasmid of IncFIB family) genes in southern Brazil. These findings highlight that K. pneumoniae isolates carrying both mcr-1 and blaKPC-2 may emergence as a serious threat to antimicrobial therapy.
