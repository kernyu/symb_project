BACKGROUND: Combining fungicides with different modes of action is regarded as one of the most effective means of slowing the selection of resistance. Field trials were used to study the effects of such mixtures on selection for Zymoseptoria tritici with reduced sensitivity to the succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHIs) and azole fungicides. The SDHI isopyrazam and the azole epoxiconazole were applied individually as solo products, and together in a preformulated mixture. All fungicide treatments were included at both full and half the recommended doses. RESULTS: Compared with using epoxiconazole alone, mixing epoxiconazole with isopyrazam led to an increase in epoxiconazole-sensitive isolates. In contrast, all treatments containing isopyrazam reduced the sensitivity of Z. tritici to isopyrazam compared with those without. Reducing doses to half the recommended rate had no effect on sensitivity of isolates to either active ingredient. In a subgroup of isolates least sensitive to isopyrazam, non-synonymous mutations were found in the SdhC and SdhD subunits, but their presence was unrelated to sensitivity. CONCLUSION: Mixing an azole and SDHI was clearly beneficial for the azole, but not for the SDHI component. This dynamic might change if strains conferring reduced sensitivity to the SDHIs were to arise. (c) 2015 Society of Chemical Industry.
