OBJECTIVE: As the risk involved with systemic antimicrobials (high doses, microbial resistance, adverse reactions, etc.) restricts their use and local delivery of antimicrobials into periodontal pockets improves periodontal health, this study was designed to investigate the effects of subgingivally delivered clarithromycin (CLM; 0.5%) as an adjunct to nonsurgical mechanotherapy in chronic periodontitis subjects. METHODS: Ninety-eight patients were categorized into two treatment groups: scaling and root planing (SRP) plus 0.5% CLM (test; group 1) and SRP plus placebo (control; group 2). Clinical parameters included gingival index (GI), sulcus bleeding index (SBI), plaque index (PI), probing depth (PD), and periodontal attachment level (PAL), recorded at 4, 8 and 12 weeks. The concentration of 0.5% CLM in gingival fluid was estimated by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. anova, the chi-square test and the Scatterthwaite test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Patients treated with SRP + CLM showed enhanced reductions in GI, SBI, and PD, and gains in PAL (P < 0.001) over time, as compared with the placebo group. However, no statistically significant differences were noted for PI. The mean concentration of CLM was detected in gingival crevicular fluid for up to 7 weeks, fulfilling the conditions for a controlled-release device. CONCLUSION: Adjunctive use of 0.5% CLM as a controlled drug delivery system enhanced the clinical outcome up to 3 months.
