OBJECTIVES: To investigate the molecular epidemiology of isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae from Saskatchewan, Canada, using Neisseria gonorrhoeae multi antigen sequence typing (NG-MAST), and to assess associations between antimicrobial susceptibility (AMS) and specific strain types (STs). METHODS: 320 consecutive gonococcal isolates, collected between 2003 and 2008, were typed by NG-MAST. STs were grouped if one of their alleles was common and the other differed by </=1% in DNA sequence. AMS was determined by agar dilution (CLSI) to seven antibiotics. RESULTS: N gonorrhoeae isolates were resolved into 82 individual NG-MAST STs and 18 NG-MAST ST groups with groups 25, 3655, 921, 3654, 3657 and 3656 comprising 53.4% (171/320) of the isolates. N gonorrhoeae isolates susceptible to all the tested antimicrobials were significantly (p<0.05) associated with ST 25 (87%). Other significant associations between ST and AMS included: ST 3654 and isolates with minimum inhibitory concentrations of >/=0.03 mg/L to third generation cephalosporins; ST 3711 (100%) and TRNG; and ST/group 3654 (43%) and chromosomal resistance to penicillin and tetracycline. Several NG-MAST STs/groups were significantly associated with isolates with chromosomal resistance to tetracycline. Isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin (n=5) and azithromycin (n=2) appeared as individual STs. Significant associations were observed among individual STs, sex and age of the patient, and regional and temporal distributions. CONCLUSIONS: Associations between N gonorrhoeae AMS and NG-MAST STs were identified and may be useful in predicting AMS regionally. Because STs in different countries vary considerably, the use of NG-MAST for the prediction of AMS globally requires further study.
