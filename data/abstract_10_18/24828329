KEY MESSAGE: Two virus inhibitory proteins were purified from Cyamopsis tetragonoloba , induced to resist virus infections by CIP-29, a systemic resistance inducing protein from Clerodendrum inerme, and characterized. One of them shared homology with a lectin. CIP-29, a known 29 kDa systemic antiviral resistance inducing protein isolated from Clerodendrum inerme, has been used to induce systemic resistance in Cyamopsis tetragonoloba against Sunn-hemp rosette virus (SRV). Paper reports the detection of virus inhibitory activity in induced-resistant leaf sap of C. tetragonoloba, and the purification of two virus inhibitory agents (VIAs) thereof. VIA activity was recorded as a reduction in lesion number of SRV, Tobacco mosaic virus, and Papaya ringspot virus, when they were incubated separately with resistant sap and inoculated onto susceptible C. tetragonoloba, Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi-nc, and Chenopodium quinoa, respectively. The two VIAs were isolated from resistant C. tetragonoloba plant leaves using combinations of column chromatography. Both were basic proteins, and since their M r was 32 and 62 kDa, these VIAs were called CT-VIA-32 and CT-VIA-62, respectively, on the basis of their molecular mass and the host. CT-VIA-62 displayed better activity, and was thus studied further. It tested positive for a glycoprotein, and was serologically detected only in leaf tissue post-induction. Tryptic peptides generated in-gel, post SDS-PAGE of CT-VIA-62, were sequenced through LC/MS/MS. All CT-VIA-62 peptides were found to share homologies with proteins from Medicago truncatula that possess a mannose-binding lectin domain.
