We developed a PCR-RFLP assay to detect mutations in the quinolone-resistance determining regions of gyrA and parC associated with fluoroquinolone resistance in Enterobacteriaceae. The assay detected mutations associated with reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and may therefore serve as a specific, rapid, inexpensive, and simple testing alternative.
