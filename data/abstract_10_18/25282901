To study the effect of Wansheng Huafeng Dan (WSHFD) and mercuric chloride on renal mercury (Hg) extraction transporters (Oat1, Oct2), renal mercury excretion transporters (Mrp4, Mate2K), renal mercury accumulation and kidney injury molecule-1 (Kim-1). The ancient prescription of WSHFD containing 10-fold Hg caused much lower renal mercury accumulation and renal toxicity than HgCl2 in rats, with less effect on renal transporters than HgCl2. The above indicators had no significant difference in WSHFDO, WSHFD2 and WSHFD3 groups, indicating no effect of WSHFD with reduced or no cinnabar.
