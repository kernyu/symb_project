Surveillance of primary drug resistance is critical to optimize antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV. Mutations to be monitored are defined in a reference list of the World Health Organization (WHO), which does not include mutations for new drugs, such as rilpivirine. We undertook a retrospective analysis of medical records of ART naive patients treated at a specialized HIV/AIDS center, evaluating the prevalence of WHO mutations and mutations specific for rilpivirine. Ninety-one patients were included during 2011-2013, being male 71 (78.0%), and men who have sex with men 46 (50.5%). The median values for age, viral load, and CD4 counts were 33 years, 62 100 copies/mL, and 548 cells/mul, retrospectively; 34 (37.3%) had early infection and 60 (65.9%) were asymptomatic. WHO mutations were found in 11 (12.1%) patients, two of whom presented multiple mutations. Seven mutations corresponded to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, four to nucleoside analogues, and two to protease inhibitors. The most frequent mutations were K103N and M41L. No differences in mutation frequencies were found when compared by time post-infection, gender, sexual orientation, or CD4 count. Mutations conferring low-level resistance to rilpivirine were found in 3 (3.3%) patients; such mutations were E138A and E138G. The overall moderate primary resistance levels found in this study highlight the value of performing a resistance test before ART initiation in the served population. The observed prevalence of primary resistance to rilpivirine was low.
