Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) is endemic in Greece. CRAB initially emerged in 2000 and since then, carbapenemases still have a crucial role in CRAB appearance, except for a few cases resulting from efflux pump or outer-membrane protein mechanisms. OXA-type carbapenemases present the highest prevalence worldwide and bla OXA-23-like and bla OXA-58-like are the most important genes found; VIM-yielding CRAB have also been detected, while a single CRAB isolate producing NDM has quite recently emerged in Greece. The predominant OXA-23 producers are associated with multilocus sequence typing Pasteur scheme sequence type 2 clonal strains of the international clone II. The emergence of colistin-resistant CRAB has complicated the treatment of such infections and the interpretation of susceptibility data. Infection control measures and adjusted antimicrobial treatment strategies could confine CRAB spread. The aim of this review is to go through the molecular epidemiology of CRAB, in an endemic area and highlight its potential future evolution.
