Recently, the pharmacokinetic (PK)-pharmacodynamic (PD) theory draws attention in the therapy of the infectious disease. Although the theory was only introduced into the field of antimicrobial therapy several years ago, the foundation was in the individualization of administering design by therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) begun 30 years ago. Although, the main purpose of TDM that had been performed so far was assumption of the evasion of the side effects caused with antimicrobials, it is difficult to say that it has been used as a tool to improve the efficacies. Furthermore, although the information described in the package inserts of antimicrobials must be important grounds to use the agents properly, it was recently recognized that there were pitfalls in PK-PD region. In this review, the following three items are described; 1) problem of dosage regimen described in package insert of antimicrobials, such as aminoglycosides and vancomycin in our country, and findings accumulated through their TDM; 2) strategy for proper use of antimicrobials based on PK-PD theory; 3) finally, the role of the pharmacist expected in the area of the infectious disease treatment.
