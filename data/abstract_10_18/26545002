OBJECTIVE: To assess the risks factors for urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamases (ESBLs)-producing E. coli and the molecular characterization of ESBLs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case-control study was performed to identify risk factors in consecutively recruited patients with UTIs caused by ESBLs or non-ESBLs-producing E. coli in a tertiary hospital in Mexico. RESULTS: ESBLs-producing E. coli were isolated from 22/70 (31%) patients with E. coli UTIs over a three month period. All isolates were resistant to cephalosporins and quinolones but susceptible to carbapenems, amikacin and nitrofurantoin. Prior antibiotic treatment with more than two antibiotic families (OR=6.86; 95%CI 1.06-157.70; p=0.028), recurrent symptomatic UTIs (OR=5.60; 95%CI 1.88-17.87; p=0.001) and previous hospitalization (OR=5.06; 95%CI 1.64-17.69; p=0.002) were significant risk factors. Sixteen isolates harbored the beta-lactamase (bla)CTX-M-15 gene and five the blaTEM-1 gene. CONCLUSIONS: One of every three patients presented UTIs with ESBLs-producing beta-lactams and fluoroquinolone resistant E. coli. Risk factors and resistance patterns must be taken into account for developing antibiotic use policies in these settings.
