The bacterium, Inquilinus limosus, with its remarkable antimicrobial multiresistant profile, has increasingly been isolated in cystic fibrosis patients. We report draft genome sequence of a strain MP06, which is of considerable interest in elucidating the associated mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in this bacterium and for an insight about its persistence in airways of these patients.
