BACKGROUND: Nosocomial infections in intensive care units are a health problem worldwide due to their incidence, prevalence and clinical impact. The objective of this article was to describe the trend of antimicrobial susceptibility during a 10-years period in both a pediatric and a neonatal intensive care unit. METHODS: This is a follow-up cohort study. In 10 years of follow-up, the antimicrobial used was considered the independent variable, and the antimicrobial susceptibility as the dependent variable. By using chi squared with Fisher exact test, the initial and final susceptibilities were compared, and also the most prevalent diagnoses and the antimicrobials. A two-tailed p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. SPSS 8 and Epi-Info 0.6 were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Antimicrobial susceptibility decreased from 66 to 45 % in 10 years, representing a global loss of 13 % (p = 0.002). The most affected antimicrobials were first-generation cephalosporin (p = 0.02), ciprofloxacin (p = 0.05), erythromycin (p = 0.001), imipenem (p = 0.001), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: There is an alarming loss of effectiveness in antimicrobial agents.
