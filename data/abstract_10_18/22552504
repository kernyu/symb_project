INTRODUCTION: The programs of rational use of antibiotics are designed to optimize antimicrobial therapy and minimize the emergence of bacterial resistance. In order to optimize the use of antibiotics we implemented an educational program based on the application of a checklist criteria for the rational use of these drugs. METHOD: We performed a cohort study unpaired in the Department of Internal Medicine, during three months. We compared a prospective cohort (A) which used a checklist, with a retrospective cohort (B) in wich prescription was based on usual clinical practice. RESULTS: We included 227 prescriptions of antibiotics. In cohort A compared to B, there was a higher proportion of switch to oral antibiotics agents and adjustment of the antimicrobial therapy to the susceptibility in the antibiogram and reduced use of associated antibiotics. Total antibiotic consumption was 117.7 DDD/100 bed-days (Defined Daily Doses). Consumption in cohorts A and B was 46.1 DDD/100 bed-days and 71.6 DDD/100 bed-days (reduction, 35.6%). There was also a reduction in consumption of ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, quinolones, vancomycin and carbapenems. Costs were reduced by 55%. There was no difference in the average hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of an educational strategy based on a checklist allowed the optimum use of antibiotics.
