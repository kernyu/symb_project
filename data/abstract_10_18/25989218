HIV resistance to current anti-HIV drugs and drug toxicity have created a need for new anti-HIV agents. We have examined and characterized a synthetic resveratrol analog, termed 3,3',4,4',5,5'-hexahydroxy-trans-stilbene (M8), for potential anti-HIV activity. Here, we demonstrate that M8 possesses potent anti-HIV activity against several HIV variants with EC50 values in the low muM range. M8 was shown to act at a very early step of HIV entry prior to fusion to host cells. These results demonstrate that this novel resveratrol derivative possesses potent anti-HIV-1 activity and may have a mechanism of action that is different from current anti-HIV-1 drugs including entry inhibitors. Further structure-guided design might lead to the development of newer improved resveratrol derivatives that could have value either in therapy or as microbicides to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV-1.
