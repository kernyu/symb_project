Three integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs), raltegravir (RAL), elvitegravir (EVG) and dolutegravir (DTG), have been approved by the FDA. Resistance against these three INSTIs have been reported and cross-resistance among them has been documented. Due to extensive and dynamic genetic diversity in different HIV-1 variants, significant differences in susceptibility to the INSTIs have been observed among HIV subtypes. This review summarizes what is known about this topic and discusses possible clinical implications.
