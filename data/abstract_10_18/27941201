INTRODUCTION: Spasticity is velocity dependent increased resistance to passive lengthening of the muscle. Mild spasticity doesn't require treatment, but severe impede with hygiene, constrict range of motion and mobility, interfere with gait pattern and can be the cause of pain and discomfort. Proper spasticity management is crucial for correct rehabilitation. THE AIM OF THE STUDY: The assesment of chemodenervation with ethyl alcohol in spasticity treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 13 patients (5 female, 8 male) age 18-68 yrs (mean 46,8+/-13,3). Qualification to the procedure requiered high level of spasticity (mean 3,4 +/- 0,5 in Ashworth scale), no response for pharmacological treatment, low level in Bartel scale. Patients were evaluated with VAS pain scale, EQ-5D before, day after and 6 weeks after procedure. RESULTS: Ashworth scale before procedure: 3-4 (mean 3.44+/-0.52), after procedure: 0-3 (mean 2.0+/-1.26), 6 weeks after procedure: 1-3 (mean 2.0+/-1.0). VAS before procedure: 0-4 (mean 1.49+/-1.9), after procedure: 0-2 (mean 1.33+/-1.0), 6 weeks after procedure (mean 1.0+/-1.0). Bartel scale before procedure: 0-16 (mean 9.25+/-6.7), after procedure: 0-16 (mean 6.0+/-8.71), 6 weeks after procedure: 0-16 (mean 9.25+/-6.7). EQ-5D results showed on Fig 5-19. CONCLUSION: Results shows improvement in every examinated aspect (decrease in spasticity level, decrease in pain, increase in quality of life and disability scale).
