Treatment options for patients with relapsed myeloma have benefited from the development of new targeted agents. The use of bortezomib, thalidomide, and lenalidomide have dramatically changed outcomes for patients with relapsed myeloma. New agents are also in development, on the basis of preclinical rationale, as well as combinations of conventional and novel agents. Together each of these treatment approaches are being tested in phase I, II, and III clinical trials, with the goal of prolonged duration of remission and, ultimately, improved overall survival.
