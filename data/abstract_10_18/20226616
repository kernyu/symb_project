Standard susceptibility testing of the Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) can require 7 to 14 days from initial isolation. We evaluated a high-performance liquid chromatography-based susceptibility test for rapid determination of clarithromycin (CLR) resistance in MAC. This method can be completed in 72 h of incubation. A total of 110 MAC strains were tested using the following concentrations of CLR: 4, 16, and 64 microg/mL, for a total of 330 tests. Microbroth dilution was used as the reference method. Rapid analysis of mycolic acid ("RAM") concordance with the reference method for CLR susceptibility was 98% (254/258) and 100% for CLR resistance (72/72). The 4 discordant results occurred with 2 strains, which demonstrated intermediate resistance with an MIC of 16 microg/mL. This study demonstrates that "RAM"-based susceptibility testing for determination of CLR resistance in MAC is both rapid and accurate, providing a significant reduction in turn-around-time from 7 to 14 days to 72 h of incubation.
