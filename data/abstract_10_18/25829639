New technologies offer rapid identification of organisms and antimicrobial resistance markers in blood cultures several hours faster than conventional methods. We sought to determine whether implementation of the Verigene(R) Gram-Positive Blood Culture (BC-GP) assay paired with a well-defined results reporting algorithm would lead to earlier deescalation of empiric therapy for inpatients with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia. The algorithm design focused on lessening the demand for pharmacist time by using electronic communications where possible. Our study compared inpatients with MSSA and VRE bacteremia from the time period before (pre-BC-GP) and after (post-BC-GP) implementation of the assay on June 25, 2013. The time from blood draw to identification and susceptibility results was decreased by 36.4 hours (P < 0.001) in the post-BC-GP group. The mean time from collection to the first dose of optimal antibiotics was reduced in the post-BC-GP group by 18.9 hours (P = 0.004) overall, with a 20.6-hour reduction (P = 0.009) for patients with MSSA and a 20.7-hour reduction (P = 0.077) for patients with VRE. Additionally, the percent of patients on empiric therapy who were placed on optimal antibiotics at any time after the Gram stain result was available increased from 64% (45/70) pre-BC-GP to 80% (43/54) post-BC-GP. The BC-GP led to an increased rate of deescalation of empiric antibiotics and a reduction in the time to optimal antibiotics for patients with MSSA and VRE bacteremia.
