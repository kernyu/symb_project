Teratoid Wilms' tumor is considered by some as a variant of Wilms' tumor containing at least 50% heterologous differentiated tissue. Fewer than 30 cases have been described. We report a 9-month-old boy with bilateral Wilms' tumors who did not respond to multiagent chemotherapy and underwent right nephrectomy that showed a teratoid Wilms' tumor. The patient continued to survive despite cessation of treatment. The overall predominance of differentiated stromal elements in this subtype of Wilms' tumor might explain the poor response to chemotherapy yet generally favorable outcome. Recognition of this subtype on biopsy might justify earlier surgical intervention that, for bilateral tumors, might allow for greater nephron sparing.
