In recent years the incidence of bloodstream infections due to Candida species has progressively increased, partly due to the more critical conditions of hospitalized patients. There has been a significant increase in immune-compromised, diabetic and/or elderly patients, also with venous access, with a subsequent increase in Candida species isolated from bloodstream infections. In 2009-2010 in the hospitals of Mestre and Venice we isolated 123 Candida species from bloodstream infections: 59 Candida albicans, 28 Candida parapsilosis, 12 Candida glabrata, 9 Candida tropicalis, and 4 Geotrichum capitatum, while the 11 others belong to 8 different species. We calculated MIC for the following antifungal agents: fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, 5-flucytosine, amphotericin B and caspofungin.
