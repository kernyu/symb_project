We report 1,4-azaindoles as a new inhibitor class that kills Mycobacterium tuberculosis in vitro and demonstrates efficacy in mouse tuberculosis models. The series emerged from scaffold morphing efforts and was demonstrated to noncovalently inhibit decaprenylphosphoryl-beta-D-ribose2'-epimerase (DprE1). With "drug-like" properties and no expectation of pre-existing resistance in the clinic, this chemical class has the potential to be developed as a therapy for drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tuberculosis.
