BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and genetic determinants of resistance of N. gonorrhoeae isolates from Hefei, China, were characterized adding a breadth of information to the molecular epidemiology of gonococcal resistance in China. METHODS: 126 N. gonorrhoeae isolates from a hospital clinic in Hefei, were collected between January, 2014, and November, 2015. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of N. gonorrhoeae isolates for seven antimicrobials were determined by the agar dilution method. Isolates were tested for mutations in penA and mtrR genes and 23S rRNA, and also genotyped using N. gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequence typing (NG-MAST). RESULTS: All N. gonorrhoeae isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin; 81.7% (103/126) to tetracycline and 73.8% (93/126) to penicillin. 39.7% (50/126) of isolates were penicillinase producing N. gonorrhoeae (PPNG), 31.7% (40/126) were tetracycline resistant N. gonorrhoeae (TRNG) and 28.6% (36/126) were resistant to azithromycin. While not fully resistant to extended spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs), a total of 14 isolates (11.1%) displayed decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone (MIC >/= 0.125 mg/L, n = 10), cefixime (MIC >/= 0. 25 mg/L, n = 1) or to both ESCs (n = 3). penA mosaic alleles XXXV were found in all isolates that harbored decreased susceptibility to cefixime, except for one. Four mutations were found in mtrR genes and mutations A2143G and C2599T were identified in 23S rRNA. No isolates were resistant to spectinomycin. Gonococcal isolates were distributed into diverse NG-MAST sequence types (STs); 86 separate STs were identified. CONCLUSIONS: N. gonorrhoeae isolates from Hefei during 2014-2015, displayed high levels of resistance to antimicrobials that had been recommended previously for treatment of gonorrhea, e.g., penicillin, tetracycline and ciprofloxacin. The prevalence of resistance to azithromycin was also high (28.6%). No isolates were found to be fully resistant to spectinomycin, ceftriaxone or cefixime; however, 11.1% isolates, overall, had decreased susceptibility to ESCs.
