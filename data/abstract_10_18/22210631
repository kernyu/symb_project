HIV-infected patients may develop rare anogenital pseudotumoral herpes potentially mimicking epidermoid carcinoma. We assessed treatment in five new cases with a median follow-up of 3.3 years. Recurrence and clinical nucleoside analog resistance were observed in all patients. All drug treatments were only temporarily curative and clinical responses varied between patients and recurrences. Foscavir seemed to be the most appropriate second-line treatment and cidofovir or thalidomide should be considered as alternative treatments.
