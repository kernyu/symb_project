The bacterial flora of lettuce from western Nigeria were investigated for their identity, antimicrobial resistance, and ability to transfer such resistance to other organisms. The isolated contaminants were mostly Gram-negative organisms of the Enterobacteriaceae family, which included Enterobacter species and E. coli. The organisms were resistant to a wide range of antimicrobials and they exhibited multiple antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. Common resistance phenotypes observed included those to beta lactam antibiotics, trimethoprim, and streptomycin. A majority of the isolates had minimum inhibitory concentration of trimethoprim over 1,000 mg/L and they were shown to possess the ability to transfer their resistance to a plasmidless E. coli strain. The results of the authors' study underscore the contributory role of lettuce in the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance in the Nigerian community.
