The response of human endometrial stem cells (hESCs) to oxidative stress has been investigated by flow cytometry. Two terminally differentiated cell lines were used for the comparison: human embryonic lung fibroblasts and human dermal fibroblasts. The oxidative stress was designed by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) action in the wide range of concentrations (50-1500 microM) during 24 h. It has been shown that the H2O2 amount per one cell (pM/cell), but not H2O2 concentration in the growth medium, should be taken into account for the accurate evaluation of H2O2 effect on different cell lines. Therefore, in our experiments LD50 reflects the amount of H2O2 per cell, at which 50% cells survived after 24 h. We have demonstrated that hESCs are more resistant to H2O2 than embryonic lung fibroblasts, but less resistant than dermal fibroblasts.
