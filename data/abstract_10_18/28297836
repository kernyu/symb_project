BACKGROUND/AIMS: The combination of daclatasvir (DCV) and asunaprevir (ASV) has demonstrated a high sustained virologic response at 12 weeks (SVR12) and a low rate of adverse events in previous clinical studies. The purpose of this study was to clarify the results of treatment and side effects in Korean patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype Ib infection. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical data from chronic HCV genotype Ib patients treated with DCV+ASV from August 2015 to September 2016 at five hospitals in the Daejeon-Chungcheong area. RESULTS: A total of 152 patients were examined for resistance associated variants (RAVs). Among them, 15 (9.9%) were positive for Y93 and one (0.7%) was positive for L31. Of 126 patients treated with DCV+ASV, 83 patients completed treatment and 76 patients were included in safety and efficacy analysis. Five (6.6%) were positive for Y93 and 12 (15.8%) exhibited cirrhotic change. DCV+ASV was the first-line treatment for 58 (76.3%) patients. Eleven (14.5%) patients relapsed after previous treatment that included interferon and seven (9.2%) of these patients were found to be intolerant of interferon. Adverse events occurred in 10 (13.2%) patients and two patients stopped the medication because of severe itching and skin rash. SVR12 was 89.5% (68/76) in all patients and 91.5% (65/71) in RAV-negative patients. CONCLUSIONS: DCV+ASV showed good efficacy in patients with HCV Ib infection in Korea. Close monitoring is needed for severe adverse events and treatment failure, which were uncommon.
