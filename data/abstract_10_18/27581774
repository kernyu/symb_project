Disseminated cryptococcosis is rare but can often become severe with a poor outcome. Given recent reports that matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analyser is useful for Cryptococcus species identification, it was applied retrospectively to past cases of disseminated cryptococcosis at our hospital over the past 10 years, and their clinical courses were reviewed. For each case, the retained Cryptococcus spp. were used for identification using both MALDI-TOF MS and genetic sequencing, as well as for drug susceptibility testing. A total of eight cases were found. Cryptococcus spp. were found in cerebrospinal fluid in 3 cases and blood in 5 cases; anti-HIV antibody was either negative or untested. MALDI-TOF MS identified Cryptococcus neoformans as the pathogen in all 8 cases, but genetic testing identified one of these as Cryptococcus curvatus. The outcome was death within 30 days in 5 of the total 8 cases and in 2 of the 3 cases in which C. neoformans was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid, despite regimens and dosages that followed IDSA Guidelines in all 3 cases. Drug susceptibility testing showed no drug resistance that would have affected the therapy. In conclusion, the outcomes were very poor in these drug-susceptible cases, despite treatment in full accordance with standard guidelines. This study confirmed the need to develop newer therapies as well as the high capability of MALDI-TOF MS for the identification of C. neoformans. Genetic testing, however, may be necessary if non-neoformans Cryptococcus is suspected.
