OBJECTIVE: To study the use of ertapenem delivered in an outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) hospital-based unit setting for targeted transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (TRUSPBx) prophylaxis in the setting of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli rectal colonization. E coli is the pathogen most commonly associated with post-TRUSPBx complications, and there is increasing prevalence of community-associated MDR E coli. METHODS: Prospective data analysis of all patients admitted to the OPAT unit for administration of intravenous antibiotics for prophylaxis for TRUSPBx over 18-month period was performed. Patients had identification of MDR E coli in rectal swab cultures and/or intolerance to available oral agents. Microbiologic data and tolerability of administered antibiotics and outcome after TRUSPBx were tabulated. RESULTS: Nine patients (median age 74 years) were referred because of antibiotic-resistant E coli from rectal swabs (all fluoroquinolone resistant, 7 MDR). All patients received ertapenem 1 g intravenously 1 day before TRUSPBx and the day of the procedure before TRUSPBx. None of the patients experienced infectious complications immediately after TRUSPBx or several weeks or months later, and no patient was lost to urologic follow-up. CONCLUSION: Increasing worldwide reports of prostatitis, urinary tract infections, and septicemia after TRUSPBx because of MDR E coli suggest rectal screening before procedure may be useful in decreasing complications. Targeted prophylaxis in these instances is necessary. Although carbapenems are used for treatment, they are not routinely used for prophylaxis. We report successful use of ertapenem delivered in a hospital-based OPAT unit for TRUSPBx prophylaxis.
