OBJECTIVE: To study the HIV-1 genotypes and transmitted drug resistance (TDR) in Dehong prefecture of Yunnan province in 2014. METHODS: A total of 70 plasma samples of recently reported HIV-infected individuals between 16 and 25 years old were collected in Dehong prefecture from January to August 2014. Among them, 58 samples which met the criterion of HIV drug resistance threshold survey (HIVDR-TS) were subjected to genetic drug resistance detection. RESULTS: 50 plasma samples were successfully sequenced and analyzed. Among them, 34.0% were Chinese and 66.0% were Burmese. Based on pol sequences, all the identified HIV genotypes would include CRF01_AE (28.0%), subtype C(20.0%), URF(20.0% ), CRF62_BC(10.0% ), CRF08_BC(8.0% ), CRF07_BC (4.0%), CRF64_BC(4.0%), subtype B(4.0%) and CRF55_01B(2.0%). One drug, which resistant mutation to proteinase inhibitors had been detected in one sequence. Based on the statistical method of HIVDR-TS, the prevalence of transmitted HIV-1 drug resistance was adjusted as <5%. CONCLUSION: The proportion of Burmese was relatively higher among those newly reported HIV-infected individuals aged 16 to 25 in Dehong. We noticed that the novel circulating recombinant forms began to function. However, the level of transmission through HIV-1 drug resistant strains still kept low in Dehong.
