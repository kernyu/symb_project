Twenty-two carbapenem-resistant enterobacterial isolates were recovered from patients hospitalized between October 2010 and March 2011 at the Royal Hospital of Muscat, Sultanate of Oman. Eleven NDM-1, five OXA-48 and one NDM-1 plus OXA-181 producers of diverse ST types were recovered from clinical samples. All carbapenemase genes were located on self-conjugative plasmids and were nearly always associated with other resistance determinants, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and the ArmA methylase encoding resistance to aminoglycosides. This work highlights the dissemination of NDM-1 and OXA-48-type producers in the Middle East.
