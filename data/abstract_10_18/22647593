This study investigated the carriage of antimicrobial resistant Haemophilus influenzae in 582 healthy children attending kindergarten or elementary school at four intervals over a 9-month period in Seoul, Korea. Diverse colonization patterns and a lower level of long-term persistent carriage by H. influenzae status were evident in this study. Colonizing H. influenzae isolates showed a high rate of resistance to beta-lactams including ampicillin (51.9%), cefaclor (52.1%), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (16.3%). Based on the ampicillin resistance mechanism, H. influenzae isolates were categorized as beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-susceptible (BLNAS) (48.1%), beta-lactamase-positive, ampicillin-resistant (BLPAR) (22.6%), beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) (22.8%), and beta-lactamase-positive, amoxicillin/clavulanate-resistant (BLPACR) strains (6.5%). This study provides the first evidence of a high prevalence (22.8%) of BLNAR strains of H. influenzae nasal carriage in healthy children attending kindergarten or the first 2 years of elementary school in Korea. The high carriage of these resistant strains in overcrowded urban settings may create reservoirs for development of H. influenzae-resistant strains.
