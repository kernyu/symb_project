PURPOSE: To describe and to compare species and antibiotics resistance patterns of bacteria involved among bacteriuria from hospital and city laboratories and among health-related and community-acquired bacteriuria. METHODS: Epidemiologic transversal study conducted among Bacteriology laboratories of University Hospital (UH) and the whole city of Reims, during the week 21 to 26 June 2010. A standardized investigation form was completed after telephonical interview with the prescriber. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-nine strains have been isolated among 179 urocultures. One hundred and seven strains were isolated in city laboratories and 82 in UH laboratory. Strains were community-acquired, health-related and nosocomial in 136, 22 and 31 cases, respectively. More Gram positive bacteria and ofloxacin resistant strains were isolated among UH strains (P=0.001 and P=0.015, respectively) and among health-related strains (P=0.01 and P=0.003, respectively). When analysis was restricted only to Enterobacteriaceae or to Escherichia coli, the ofloxacin resistance rate was no more elevated among health-related or UH strains. Ofloxacin resistant Enterobacteriaceae were more frequently resistant to all other classes of antibiotics except nitrofurans. DISCUSSION: Strains isolated in health-related bacteriuria are more frequently ofloxacin resistant principally because of the greater proportion of Gram positive bacteria and because of a non-significant higher ofloxacin resistance rate among Enterobacteriaceae. Numerous studies only focus on Enterobacteriaceae, and the data from our study need to be confirmed on larger samples, in order to validate the predictive value of health-related bacteriuria for ofloxacin resistance.
