A series of synthetic dimeric cationic anthraquinone analogs (CAAs) with potent antimicrobial activities against a broad range of fungi and bacteria were developed. These compounds were prepared in 2-3 steps with high overall yield and possess alkyl chain, azole, quinone, and quaternary ammonium complexes (QACs). In vitro biological evaluations reveal prominent inhibitory activities of lead compounds against several drug-susceptible and drug-resistant fungal and bacterial strains, including MRSA, VRE, Candida albicans and Aspergillus flavus. Mode of action investigation reveals that the synthesized dimeric CAA's can disrupt the membrane integrity of fungi. Computational studies reveal possible designs that can revive the activity of QACs against drug-resistant bacteria. Cytotoxicity assays in SKOV-3, a cancer cell line, show that the lead compounds are selectively toxic to fungi and bacteria over human cells.
