According to WHO estimates, between 1 and 20% of tuberculosis cases in the world are multiresistant. In Gabon, this prevalence is estimated at 1.9%. In this forward-looking study from March 2006 to August 2010, we report 16 cases of multi-resistant tuberculosis out of 24 suspected resistant samples (persistence of the clinical and radiological signs after three months of well conducted treatment with first-line anti-tuberculous drugs). This study is realized in association with the laboratory of mycobacterium of the Percy military teaching hospital, Clamart, France.
