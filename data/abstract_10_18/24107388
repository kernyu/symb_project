OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae is increasing and the therapeutic options are limited, especially in primary care. Recent indications have suggested pivmecillinam to be a suitable option. Here, we evaluated the clinical and bacteriological effects of pivmecillinam in UTIs caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. METHODS: We carried out a prospective follow-up of 39 patients diagnosed with UTI caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, initiated on pivmecillinam. The patients were from general practice (n = 29) or admitted to hospitals (n = 10) in the Copenhagen area, Denmark (n = 30) or Halland, Sweden (n = 9). Both patients and physicians were asked to complete a questionnaire on the pretreatment signs and symptoms. Patients were asked to send in two more urine samples for culture examination, together with questionnaires for clinical effect, 2-6 and 10-20 days, respectively, after end of treatment. RESULTS: Of the 39 patients included, 30 received a treatment regimen of 400 mg of pivmecillinam three times a day and 9 received 200 mg three times a day. All isolates were susceptible to mecillinam. The bacteriological cure rate was 79% (31/39); 80% (24/30) and 78% (7/9) for 400 and 200 mg three times a day, respectively. Relapse, i.e. ESBL-producing bacteria in the second control urine after previous bacteriological cure, was seen in five patients. Clinical cure was evaluable in 19 patients; 16 had a clinical effect (84%). CONCLUSIONS: Pivmecillinam was proven bacteriologically and clinically effective for treatment of lower UTIs caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae.
