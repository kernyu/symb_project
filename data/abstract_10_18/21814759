The ability to produce biofilm and the presence of metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) among Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were evaluated. A total of 91 isolates were recovered from sputa of patients with (CF, n = 44) and without (non-CF, n = 47) cystic fibrosis diagnosis. Seventy-nine (86.8%; 95% CI 78.3-92.3%) were biofilm producers. Interestingly, all isolates harboring MBL showed ability (most strong or moderate) to produce biofilm in vitro. We alert to an "overlapping of mechanisms" that together represent an even greater challenge for the treatment of pulmonary infections by P. aeruginosa.
