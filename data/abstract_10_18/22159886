The reemergence of infectious diseases and the continuous development of multidrug resistance among a variety of disease-causing bacteria in clinical setting pose a serious threat to public health worldwide. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) that mediate resistance to third-generation cephalosporin are now observed all over the world in all species of Enterobacteriaceae, especially Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. In this work, ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized by the sol-gel method and characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The image of synthesized ZnO NPs appeared spherical in SEM with a diameter of approximately 19 nm and as hexagonal crystal in AFM. Clinical isolates were assessed for ESBL production and shown to be sensitive to ZnO NPs by different methods such as minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration, time-dependent growth inhibition assay, well diffusion agar methods and estimation of colony forming units (CFU) of bacteria. The lowest MIC value for E. coli and K. pneumoniae was found to be 500 mug/ml. The results showed that ZnO NPs at 1,000 mug/ml completely inhibit the bacterial growth. The antibacterial effect of ZnO nanoparticles was gradual, but time- and concentration-dependent. The maximum inhibition zone at100 mug/ml for E. coli and K. pneumoniae was 22 and 20 mm, respectively. With the increasing ZnO NP loading, there is significant reduction in the numbers of CFU. At the concentration of 1,000 mug/ml, the decline in per cent survival of E. coli and K. pneumoniae was found to be 99.3% and 98.6%, respectively.
