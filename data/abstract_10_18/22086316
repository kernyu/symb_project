OBJECTIVES: To determine the Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Levofloxacin against HELICOBACTER PYLORI (HP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: 95 HP Peruvian strains were evaluated in Agar dilution and Disk diffusion tests, as well as the Pearson Coefficient (r) and the inoculum's effect. RESULTS: 36.9% (35 of 95) were resistant (MIC>1 mug/ml) to Levofloxacin. MIC(9)(0) was 16 ug/ml (CI:90%). MIC of Levofloxacin did not change at different inoculum concentrations. r: -0.733 (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of HP Levofloxacin resistant strains in Peru is higher than in developed countries. Periodic testing of antibiotic susceptibility is warranted to select the most accurate therapies.
