Discovery of new polypharmacological antibacterial agents with multiple modes of actions can be an alternative to combination therapy and also a possibility to slow development of antibiotic resistance. In support to this hypothesis, we synthesized 16 compounds by combining the pharmacophores of Chlamydia trachomatis inhibitors and inhibitors of type III secretion (T3S) in gram-negative bacteria. In this study we have developed salicylidene acylhydrazide sulfonamides (11c &11d) as new antichlamydial agents that also inhibit T3S in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis.
