Solar disinfection and solar-driven advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) (namely H2O2/sunlight, TiO2/sunlight, H2O2/TiO2/sunlight, solar photo-Fenton) were evaluated in the inactivation of indigenous antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) in real urban wastewater. A multidrug resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli strain isolated from the effluent of the biological process of an urban wastewater treatment plant was the target ARB. The higher inactivation rates (residual density under detection limit, 2 CFUm L(-1)) were achieved with H2O2/TiO2/sunlight (cumulative energy per unit of volume (QUV) in the range 3-5 kJ L(-1), depending on H2O2/TiO2 ratio) and H2O2/sunlight (QUV of 8 kJ L(-1)) processes. All investigated processes did not affect antibiotic resistance of survived colonies. Moreover, H2O2/sunlight was compared with conventional chlorination process to evaluate bacterial regrowth potential and particularly the proportion of indigenous MDR E. coli with respect to total indigenous E. coli population. Chlorination (1.0 mg Cl2 L(-1)) was more effective than H2O2/sunlight (50 mg H2O2 L(-1)) to achieve total inactivation of MDR E. coli (15 min Vs 90 min) but less effective in controlling their regrowth (24 h Vs 48 h). Interestingly, the percentage of MDR E. coli in H2O2/sunlight treated samples decreased as incubation time increased; the opposite was observed for chlorinated samples.
