Analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is important for diagnosis of infectious and genetic diseases, for environment and population studies, as well as in forensic applications. Herein is a detailed description to design an "operating cooperatively" (OC) sensor for highly specific SNP analysis. OC sensors use two unmodified DNA adaptor strands and a molecular beacon probe to detect a nucleic acid targets with exceptional specificity towards SNPs. Genotyping can be accomplished at room temperature in a homogenous assay. The approach is easily adaptable for any nucleic acid target, and has been successfully used for analysis of targets with complex secondary structures. Additionally, OC sensors are an easy-to-design and cost-effective method for SNP analysis and nucleic acid detection.
