Resistome analysis of clinical VIM-1-producing Enterobacter cloacae strain CY01 from China revealed the presence of multiple resistance determinants. Two resistance plasmids were identified in CY01. The pCY-VIM plasmid was 14 kb in size and possessed a replicase gene (repA), a gene cluster encoding the partitioning function (parABC), and a carbapenemase gene (blaVIM-1). Another 5.9-kb plasmid, pCY-MdT, with an aac(6')-Ib gene, was very closely related (13 nucleotide differences) to pMdT1, a ColE1 plasmid carrying aac(6')-Ib-cr4.
