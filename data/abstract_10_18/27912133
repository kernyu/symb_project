To simulate the fate of antibiotic resistance in leachate from anaerobic carcass landfill site, anaerobic reactors were set-up and their antibiotic resistance activities were monitored for 2 years. Initially, Escherichia coli DH5alpha with tetracycline resistance pB10 plasmid was inoculated in nutrient rich anaerobic reactors. The fate of tetracycline resistant bacteria (TRB) was tracked by analysis using culture-based method, EC50 (half maximal effective concentration), and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Based on the temporal pattern of EC50 during the study period, TRB continuously increased during Phase I (0-250th day), went down in Phase II (after 250th day to 500th day), and then increased again by the end of Phase III (after 500th day to the 774th day). Interestingly, pB10 plasmid accumulated in the system as the community diversities increased over time. At the end of experiment, the tetracycline resistance microbial communities were investigated by 16s RNA gene-based pyro sequencing. The results of this study indicated that leachate with high organic strength in anaerobic conditions could be an antibiotic resistant point source in several year periods.
