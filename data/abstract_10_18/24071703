OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical manifestation and determine the distribution of pathogens and their characteristics of drug susceptibility to bloodstream infections (BSIs), and provide evidence for clinical anti-infection treatments after renal transplantation. METHODS: Totally 81 episodes of BSIs occurred in 71 patients between July 2003 and June 2013. We retrospectively analyzed the pathogens and their drug susceptibility characteristics with BD microbiological assay system. We also collected the clinical and laboratory data of the patients . RESULTS: The main pathogens were gram negative bacteria (67.90%), followed by gram positive bacteria (28.40%) and fungi (3.70%). The most common gram negative bacillus was Escherichia coli. While for gram positive bacteria, the main bacillus was coagulase-negative staphylococci. The gram negative bacteria were relatively sensitive to aminoglycosides and carbapenem. The gram positive bacteria were sensitive to glycopeptides and oxazolidone. CONCLUSION: The clinical manifestations included high body temperature, onset in the early period after kidney transplantation and high mortality. Though gram positive coccus plays an important role, most infections are caused by gram negative bacteria in BSIs after the renal transplantation. The antibiotic resistant rate for gram negative bacteria is very high as well as gram positive bacteria.
