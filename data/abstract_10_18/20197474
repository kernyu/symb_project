OBJECTIVE: To report on 6 weeks of daptomycin treatment for tricuspid valve endocarditis caused by Staphylococcus aureus in a pregnant female in her second trimester. CASE SUMMARY: A 24-year-old, 14-week pregnant patient with no significant medical history, but with a history of intravenous drug abuse presented with tricuspid valve endocarditis caused by methicillin-sensitive S. aureus. After initial treatment with vancomycin, the patient continued to have fever and bacteremia and was initiated on daptomycin 6 mg/kg for 6 weeks of therapy. The treatment resulted in the resolution of the endocarditis, and no adverse sequelae were identified in the mother or baby. DISCUSSION: Infective endocarditis is a common infection encountered in the hospital setting and represents an increased cost burden to institutions due to prolonged lengths of treatment. Antimicrobial resistance, antimicrobial failure, inadequate attainment of effective drug concentrations, drug allergies, and adverse reactions may be factors that limit the use of commonly utilized antimicrobial agents. Therefore, newer therapies like daptomycin may need to be employed in these situations. Although daptomycin is pregnancy category B, limited case reports with neonatal outcomes are reported. CONCLUSIONS: This case provides further support for the safety of daptomycin in pregnancy with the dose of 6 mg/kg, the extended duration of therapy (6 weeks), and the primary exposure in the second trimester.
