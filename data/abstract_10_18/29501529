OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to determinate the prevalence of Escherichia coli and its resistance to antimicrobials and the presence of virulence genes in retail samples of beef and pork in several locations in Tamaulipas. METHODS: In this work, a total of 106 samples (beef and pork) collected from August 2013 to March 2014, were analyzed to detect Escherichia coli and then analyzed for virulence, antibiotic resistance gene detection, and tested for susceptibility to 16 antimicrobials. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-eight Escherichia coli isolates were obtained and of these, 1.8% harbored stx1; stx2 and hlyA was detected in 17.7% and 21.5% of isolates, respectively. High-resistance phenotypes were observed in almost all of the isolates since 92.4% showed a multi-resistant phenotype with resistance to cephalothin 92%, ampicillin 92%, cefotaxime 78%, nitrofurantoin 76% and tetracycline 75%. tetA and tetB were detected in 56% of isolates, strA in 9.6%, aadA in 17%, and aac(3)-IV in only 0.6% of strains. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, it can be concluded that retail beef and pork meat, might play a role in the spread of antibiotic resistant Escherichia coli strains in our region.
