Prospective hospital-based surveillance for Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDAD) was conducted in Barcelona (Spain) to describe the epidemiology of this condition and investigate the risk factors for an unfavorable outcome. All patients diagnosed with CDAD during 2009 were included. Using logistic regression modeling, we analyzed the potential risk factors associated with recurrent and complicated CDAD, defined as a need for colectomy or death within 30 days. There were 365 episodes of CDAD, yielding an incidence of 22.5 cases/10(5) person-years, 1.22 cases/10(3) hospital discharges, and 1.93 cases/10(4) patient-days. The main PCR ribotypes identified were 241 (26%), 126 (18%), 078 (7%), and 020 (5%). PCR ribotype 027 was not detected. Among the 348 cases analyzed, 232 (67%) patients were cured, 63 (18%) had a recurrence of CDAD, and 53 (15%) developed complicated CDAD. Predictors of complicated CDAD were continued use of antibiotics following CDAD diagnosis (odds ratio [OR], 2.009; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.012 to 3.988; P = 0.046), Charlson comorbidity index score (OR, 1.265; 95% CI, 1.105 to 1.449; P = 0.001), and age (OR, 1.028; 95% CI, 1.005 to 1.053; P = 0.019). A leukocyte count of >15 x 10(3) cells/ml (OR, 2.277; 95% CI, 1.189 to 4.362; P = 0.013), continuation of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use after CDAD diagnosis (OR, 2.168; 95% CI, 1.081 to 4.347; P = 0.029), and age (OR, 1.021; 95% CI, 1.001 to 1.041; P = 0.036) were independently associated with higher odds of recurrence. The incidence of CDAD in Barcelona during 2009 was on the lower end of the previously described range for all of Europe. Our analysis suggests that the continuation of non-C. difficile antibiotics and use of PPIs in patients diagnosed with CDAD are associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes.
