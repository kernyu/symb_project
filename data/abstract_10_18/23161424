Topoisomerase inhibitors have been developed in a variety of clinical applications. We investigated the inhibitory effect of evodiamine on E. coli topoisomerase I, which may lead to an anti-bacterial effect. Evodiamine inhibits the supercoiled plasmid DNA relaxation that is catalyzed by E. coli topoisomerase I, and computer-aided docking has shown that the Arg161 and Asp551 residues of topoisomerase I interact with evodiamine. We investigated the bactericidal effect of evodiamine against multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. Evodiamine showed a significantly lower minimal inhibitory concentration value (MIC 128 microg/mL) compared with antibiotics (>512 microg/mL) against the clinical isolate of K. pneumoniae. The results suggested that evodiamine is a potential agent against drug-resistant bacteria.
