TD-1792 is a new multivalent glycopeptide-cephalosporin antibiotic with potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria. The in vitro activity of TD-1792 was tested against 527 Staphylococcus aureus isolates, including multidrug-resistant isolates. TD-1792 was highly active against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MIC(90), 0.015 mug/ml), methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (MIC(90), 0.03 mug/ml). Time-kill studies demonstrated the potent bactericidal activity of TD-1792 at concentrations of </= 0.12 mug/ml. A postantibiotic effect of >2 h was observed after exposure to TD-1792.
