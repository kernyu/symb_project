Periodontal disease is defined as chronic inflammatory condition characterized by the destruction of the periodontal tissues causing loss of connective tissue attachment, loss of alveolar bone, and the formation of pathological pockets around the diseased teeth. The use of systemic antibiotics has been advocated for its treatment, but concerns emerged with respect to adverse drug reactions and its contribution to bacterial resistance. Thus local drug delivery devices have been developed that aim to deliver a high concentration of antimicrobial drugs directly to the affected site, while minimizing drug's systemic exposure. A burst release of antimicrobial agent from carrier, resulting in a short and inadequate exposure of bacteria residing in periodontal pocket to the agent, remains the main challenge of current local delivery systems for the treatment of periodontal disease. This review aims to investigate and compare different local antimicrobial delivery systems with regard to the treatment of periodontal disease.
