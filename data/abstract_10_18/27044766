BACKGROUND/AIMS: Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) exhibits similar antiviral efficacy against treatment-naive and lamivudine (LAM)-resistant chronic hepatitis B (CHB). However, there are few clinical reports on the antiviral effects of TDF-LAM combination therapy compared to TDF monotherapy in patients with LAM-resistant CHB. METHODS: We investigated the antiviral efficacy of TDF monotherapy vs. TDF-LAM combination therapy in 103 patients with LAM-resistant CHB. RESULTS: The study subjects were treated with TDF alone (n=40) or TDF-LAM combination therapy (n=63) for >/=6 months. The patients had previously been treated with TDF-based rescue therapy for a median of 30.0 months (range, 8-36 months). A virologic response (VR) was achieved in 99 patients (96.1%): 95.0% (38/40) of patients in the TDF monotherapy group and 96.8% (61/63) of patients in the TDF-LAM combination therapy group. The VR rates were not significantly different between the TDF monotherapy and TDF-LAM combination therapy groups (88.9 vs. 87.3% at month 12, and 94.4 vs. 93.7% at month 24, log-rank p=0.652). Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that none of the pretreatment factors were significantly associated with VR. CONCLUSIONS: TDF monotherapy was as effective as TDF-LAM combination therapy for maintaining viral suppression in the vast majority of patients with LAM-resistant CHB, which suggests that TDF add-on therapy with LAM is unnecessary.
