Prevention of bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation on the surfaces of materials is a topic of major medical and societal importance. Various synthetic approaches based on immobilization or release of bactericidal substances such as metal derivatives, polyammonium salts and antibiotics were extensively explored to produce antibacterial coatings. Although providing encouraging results, these approaches suffer from the use of active agents which may be associated with side-effects such as cytotoxicity, hypersensibility, inflammatory responses or the progressive alarming phenomenon of antibiotic resistance. In addition to these synthetic approaches, living organisms, e.g. animals and plants, have developed fascinating strategies over millions of years to prevent efficiently the colonization of their surfaces by pathogens. These strategies have been recently mimicked to create a new generation of bio-inspired biofilm-resistant surfaces. In this review, we discuss some of these bio-inspired methods devoted to the development of antibiofilm surfaces. We describe the elaboration of antibacterial coatings based on natural bactericidal substances produced by living organisms such as antimicrobial peptides, bacteriolytic enzymes and essential oils. We discuss also the development of layers mimicking algae surfaces and based on anti-quorum-sensing molecules which affect cell-to-cell communication. Finally, we report on very recent strategies directly inspired from marine animal life and based on surface microstructuring.
