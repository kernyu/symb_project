About 20 species of rapidly growing mycobacteria species that are capable of infecting human beings and causing bloodstream infections have been identified. Many more of these species are being discovered worldwide, especially in resource-poor settings. These microorganisms have been known to cause outbreaks and pseudo-outbreaks. Although rapidly growing mycobacteria are not highly virulent or life threatening, they have a high predisposition to create biofilms and to colonise and infect intravascular catheters. Early detection and identification of specific species can help to estimate predictable antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. However, because susceptibility data originate from developed countries, studies in resource-poor settings urgently need to be done. The best outcome of cure without recurrence depends on a combination of at least 4 weeks of treatment with two or more active antimicrobial agents, plus removal of the intravascular catheter. We review and discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, management, and outcomes of rapidly growing mycobacterial bloodstream infections.
