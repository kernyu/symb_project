Viruses are the major cause of disease and mortality worldwide. Nowadays there are treatments based on antivirals or prophylaxis with vaccines. However, the rising number of reports of viral resistance to current antivirals and the emergence of new types of virus has concerned the scientific community. In this scenario, the search for alternative treatments has led scientists to the discovery of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) derived from many different sources. Since some of them have shown antiviral activities, here we challenged 10 synthetic peptides from different animal and plant sources against, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), and Aichi virus. Among them, the highlight was Pa-MAP from the polar fish Pleuronectes americanus, which caused around 90% of inhibition of the HSV with a selectivity index of 5 and a virucidal mechanism of action. Moreover, LL-37 from human neutrophils showed 96% of inhibition against the Aichi virus, showing a selectivity index of 3.4. The other evaluated peptides did not show significant antiviral activity. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that Pa-MAP seems to be a reliable candidate for a possible alternative drug to treat HSV-1 infections. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
