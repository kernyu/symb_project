Antimicrobial administration is essential for the control and treatment of diseases in animals, but the emergence and prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a significant concern during animal production. Here we investigated the antimicrobial susceptibility of S. aureus from diseased food-producing animals and molecularly characterized the methicillin-resistant and fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates. A total of 290 S. aureus isolates obtained from cattle (n=246), swine (n=16), and chickens (n=28) between 2003 and 2009 were examined for antimicrobial susceptibility against 9 antimicrobials using an agar dilution method. Resistance to penicillin (PC) was most frequently found (24.8%), followed by oxytetracycline (OTC, 10.0%), dihydrostreptomycin (4.1%), erythromycin (EM, 3.1%), enrofloxacin (ERFX, 2.1%), and kanamycin (1.7%). The PC resistance rate was significantly higher in swine than in cattle (P<0.01) and chickens (P<0.01). The resistance rates to OTC, EM and ERFX were significantly higher in swine and chickens than in cattle (P<0.05). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was recovered from milk derived from a cow with mastitis in 2003; sequence type 8, SCCmec type IV and spa type t024. In the six ERFX-resistant strains isolated after 2003, amino acid substitutions in ParC with/without GyrA were detected. As the prevalence of MRSA and FQ-resistant S. aureus in the animals should be noticed, continuous monitoring is necessary to control resistance to clinically important antimicrobials in S. aureus from food-producing animals.
