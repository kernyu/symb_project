OBJECTIVES: Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) has been regarded as a promising candidate for cancer therapy. However, most of oral cancer cell lines are resistant to the TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity. The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) to sensitize TRAIL-induced apoptosis in TRAIL-resistant oral cancer cells and xenografts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay, Western blotting, and a mouse xenograft model were used to study the effects of PEITC and TRAIL on two TRAIL-resistant human oral cancer cells, SAS and Ca9-22. RESULTS: PEITC upregulated death receptor 4 (DR4) and DR5 protein expression and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in both SAS and Ca9-22 cells. Antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP600125 inhibited PEITC-induced DR4 and DR5 expression. Inhibitor experiments showed that PEITC induced apoptosis through ROS-mediated JNK activation and upregulation of DR4 and DR5. Furthermore, treatment with PEITC significantly increased TRAIL-induced apoptosis in both cells. Combined treatment with PEITC and TRAIL had greater effect on the inhibition of tumor growth than either agent alone. CONCLUSIONS: We showed for the first time that PEITC overcomes TRAIL resistance in oral cancer cells and enhance the therapeutic potential of TRAIL in vivo. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: PEITC, either alone or in combination with TRAIL, can be used as a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of oral cancers.
