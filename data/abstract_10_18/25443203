OBJECTIVE: To report the management of a severe and recurrent fungal keratitis that required repeated penetrating keratoplasties. Despite multiple topical, intraocular and systemic antifungal treatments, superotemporal hyphal infiltration repeatedly penetrated the corneal transplant causing continuous recurrences. Cultures collected before and during surgery isolated the same organism, Fusarium spp. CONCLUSION: Corneal infection extending to the sclera and internal angle structures is the main cause of recurrence of fungal keratitis after corneal transplantation. Sectorial full-thickness sclero-keratoplasty combined with a central penetrating keratoplasty should be a surgical technique to be considered in cases where these locations are suspected to be the source of recurrence. It enables a definitive elimination of the infection, with excellent final visual acuities. No postoperative complications were reported in this case.
