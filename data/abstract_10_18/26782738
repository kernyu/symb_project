Continual occurrence of foodborne outbreaks, along with the increase in antibiotic resistance which burdens clinical treatments, has urged scientists to search for other potential promising antimicrobial agents. Antimicrobial peptides are emerging as one of the potential alternatives. The mode of action of a given AMP is critical and essential for future application; however, it is still not completely known for many of these compounds. Ib-AMP1 is a plant-derived AMP, purified from seeds of Impatiens balsamina and has been shown to exert antibacterial and antifungal activity at the micromolar level. A study had shown that the therapeutic index of Ib-AMP1 against eight human pathogens is 23.5. The objective of the present study was to determine the in vivo mode of action of Ib-AMP1 against Escherichia coli O157:H7. A concentration-dependent effect of Ib-AMP1 on the E. coli O157:H7 cell membrane occurred. Ib-AMP1 treatments resulted in efflux of K(+) and ATP, suggesting pores of sufficient size to allow efflux of large molecules. Ib-AMP1 at sublethal concentrations exerts a greater effect at the intracellular level. In contrast, Ib-AMP1 at a lethal concentration permeabilizes cell membranes and may directly or indirectly inhibit intracellular macromolecule synthesis. Collectively, results of this study suggest Ib-AMP1 is bactericidal interfering within outer and inner membrane integrity permitting efflux of ATP and interfering with intracellular biosynthesis of DNA, RNA and protein.
