In recent years, Scedosporium species have been more commonly recognized from severe, difficult-to-treat human infections, such as upper respiratory tract and pulmonary infections. To select an appropriate therapeutic approach for these infections is challenging, because of the commonly observed resistance of the causative agents to several antifungal drugs. Therefore, to find a novel strategy for the treatment of pulmonary Scedosporium infections the in vitro antifungal effect of a mucolytic agent, N-acetyl-L-cysteine and its in vitro combinations with conventional antifungals were investigated. Synergistic and indifferent interactions were registered in 23 and 13 cases, respectively. Antagonism was not revealed between the compounds.
