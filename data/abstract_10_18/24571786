A total of 122 Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolated in the Tokyo metropolitan area in 2005-2011 were collected and analyzed by N. gonorrhoeae multiantigen sequence typing (NG-MAST) and for their susceptibility to azithromycin and ceftriaxone. All 122 strains were susceptible to ceftriaxone, but 8 strains were azithromycin-resistant, defined as an azithromycin MIC >/= 1 mug/ml. The 8 azithromycin-resistant strains were in 6 NG-MAST types, 3 strains in NG-MAST type 1407 and each of the other 5 strains in a different NG-MAST type. NG-MAST type 1407 strains are multidrug-resistant and are disseminated worldwide.
