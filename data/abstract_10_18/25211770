The total synthesis of two key analogues of vancomycin containing single-atom exchanges in the binding pocket (residue 4 amidine and thioamide) are disclosed as well as their peripherally modified (4-chlorobiphenyl)methyl (CBP) derivatives. Their assessment indicates that combined pocket amidine and CBP peripherally modified analogues exhibit a remarkable spectrum of antimicrobial activity (VSSA, MRSA, VanA and VanB VRE) and impressive potencies (MIC = 0.06-0.005 mug/mL) against both vancomycin-sensitive and -resistant bacteria and likely benefit from two independent and synergistic mechanisms of action. Like vancomycin, such analogues are likely to display especially durable antibiotic activity not prone to rapidly acquired clinical resistance.
