The authors sought to assess whether viral load (VL) monitoring frequency was associated with differential rates of virologic failure (VF) among HIV Outpatient Study (HOPS) participants seen during 1999 to 2013, who had maintained VL <50 copies/mL, CD4 counts >/=300 cells/mm(3), and been prescribed a stable combination antiretroviral regimen for at least 2 years. The authors required VL and CD4 testing to have occurred regularly for the entire 2-year period. The authors assessed rates of VF comparing patients who maintained a frequent VL testing (>/=3 VLs) to those who shifted to a less frequent schedule (2 VL) after the 2-year period. Virologic failure was observed among 116 of 573 participants. The authors did not detect statistically significant difference in frequency of VF among patients undergoing frequent (21.0%) versus less frequent VL testing (19.6%), even after multivariable adjustment. Biannual VL monitoring for stable patients with aviremia could generate substantial cost savings without the increased risk of VF.
