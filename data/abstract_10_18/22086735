Malfunctions in the regulation of apoptosis cause the accumulation of malignant, long-lived B CD19+/CD5+ cells in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The primary goal in CLL therapy is to overcome resistance to apoptosis and efficiently trigger programmed cell death in leukemic cells. This study demonstrated that the in vivo responses of malignant cells from CLL patients after administration of purine analogs (cladribine/fludarabine) with cyclophosphamide vary significantly. For comparative purposes, the sensitivity of leukemic cells obtained from the same CLL patients to conventional purine analogs and the selective CDK inhibitor R-roscovitine (ROSC) was determined, with and without the addition of an alkylating agent, prior to the onset of in vivo therapy. The kinetics and rate of spontaneous and drug-induced apoptosis of CLL cells under ex vivo conditions differed significantly between patients, mirroring the variability observed during in vivo treatment. Interestingly, individual patients' leukemic cells were comparably sensitive to the drugs under both conditions. Of the drugs examined, ROSC exerted the highest therapeutic efficacy under ex vivo conditions. Our results indicate that ex vivo testing might be useful for identifying the most potent first-line therapeutic regimen for specific CLL patients and possibly for the design of therapies tailored for individual CLL patients.
