BACKGROUND AND AIM: Although entecavir has been shown to have good efficacy and low resistance for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB), factors associated with a favorable response remain unknown. METHODS: This was a retrospective, multicenter study of 248 treatment-naive hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive patients (69.4% male; median age, 39.4 years) treated with entecavir for more than 1 year, and 15.7% of them had cirrhosis at baseline. The primary endpoints were HBeAg loss and/or seroconversion. RESULTS: The median baseline levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA were 201 U/L (range, 27-2415 U/L) and 7.6 log(10) IU/mL (range, 2.2-13.18), respectively. The median treatment period was 25.3 months (range, 12-69.6). The rates of ALT normalization at years 1, 2, and 3 were 83.1%, 87.9%, and 94.9%, respectively. The cumulative rates of HBeAg loss at years 1, 2, and 3 were 20.3%, 38.0%, and 48.9%, respectively. The rates of undetectable HBV-DNA at years 1, 2, and 3 were 52.1%, 78.9%, and 82.5%, respectively. Using Cox proportional hazards model, multivariate analysis showed that baseline ALT greater than five times the upper limit of normal, and viral load were independent factors associated with HBeAg loss (hazard ratio: 1.81, and 0.812; 95% confidence interval: 1.062-3.085; 0.7-0.942, respectively). CONCLUSION: Entecavir treatment for 3 years can achieve good biochemical and virologic responses in HBeAg-positive CHB patients, but has a modest effect on HBeAg loss and/or seroconversion. In addition, baseline serum ALT and HBV-DNA levels are independent factors associated with favorable treatment responses.
