While infections caused by Enterococcus faecium resistant to vancomycin (VRE) are increasing, linezolid-resistant strains are still rare. We present the case of a 10-year-old girl with severe sepsis caused by a linezolid-resistant E. faecium (Van-B VRE) after multiple trauma and right-sided hemipelvectomy. The off-label use of a targeted antimicrobial therapy with daptomycin (350 mg/day; approximately 8 mg/kg) for 17 days resulted in rapid normalization of infection parameters and improved clinical status. No side effects were observed and the patient was successfully discharged from the intensive care unit.
