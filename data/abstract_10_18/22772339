AIMS: Carbapenem resistance due to metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) in Enterobacteriaceae has gained much prominence in recent months. The emergence and subsequent spread of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) constitutes a potential threat in terms of the management of affected patients and institutional infection control efforts. We evaluated an in-house prepared meropenem impregnated MacConkey agar versus CHROMagar KPC. METHODS: The lowest limit of detection (LLD) was compared for nine clinical isolates of NDM-1 producing Enterobacteriaceae on the above mentioned agar media. RESULTS: LLD was comparable for all the nine clinical isolates on both media. The cost of the antibiotic impregnated MacConkey agar was considerably lower (US$0.39) as compared to the commercial media, while its performance remained unaltered for a period of at least 8 weeks of storage. CONCLUSION: The in-house medium proved to be a suitable and cheap alternative to the CHROMagar KPC.
