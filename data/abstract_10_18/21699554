AIMS: Aim of this study is to characterize clinical isolates of Salmonella Typhimurium that occurred in Portuguese children on the basis of their virulence and antimicrobial resistance profiles and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing and to analyse possible strain relatedness. METHODS AND RESULTS: Different Salmonella serotypes were isolated from clinical cases of salmonellosis that had occurred in two Portuguese hospitals (a total of 259 isolates). All Salm. Typhimurium strains, with the age of the patients known, (total of 26 isolates) were selected for this study. These isolates were characterized for their virulence gene profiles (agfA, iroB, slyA, hin/H2, spv), antimicrobial resistance profiles and investigated for the occurrence of multidrug-resistant Salm. Typhimurium DT 104 by PCR. Salmonella isolates showed high rates of resistance to four or more antibiotics, 100% resistance to sulfadiazine and a high percentage of strains with the resistance profile of Salm. Typhimurium DT 104, two of them with this phage type (determined by PCR). A relationship between some clusters and their resistance and virulence profiles was detected, each cluster having the same profile. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed high-antibiotic resistance of the Salmonella strains investigated, and the presence of multidrug-resistant Salm. Typhimurium DT104 in infections of Portuguese children. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Study is based on regarding the increase in antibiotic resistance by Salmonella strains isolated from infections in Portuguese children and on the presence of Salm. Typhimurium DT 104 circulating in Portugal.
