The recent marketing authorizations and hence availability of the new protease inhibitors, telaprevir and boceprevir, have profoundly changed the management of chronic hepatitis C patients. Guidelines for the use of these new drugs as part of a triple therapy, in combination with the standard therapy of peginterferon plus ribavirin, are proposed. The guidelines have been drawn up and evaluated by a meeting of the French Association for the Study of the Liver, posted online for comments, and extensively reviewed by international experts. The current published data on the various treatment strategies are reviewed. The guidelines address the majority of patient profiles including treatment-naive patients and patients with failure of previous treatment. They recommend which patients should be treated with triple therapy and consider the results of triple therapy including the factors that are predictive of response. They consider the circumstances in which the length of triple therapy can be shortened and the advantages of a peginterferon plus ribavirin lead-in phase. Virological monitoring, stopping criteria, the evaluation of resistance to protease inhibitors, practical treatment management, treatment adherence and the management of side effects are discussed and simple guidelines proposed.
