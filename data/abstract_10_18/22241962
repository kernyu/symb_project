Defects in apoptosis contribute to treatment resistance and poor outcome of pancreatic cancer, calling for novel therapeutic strategies. Here, we provide the first evidence that nuclear factor (NF) kappaB is required for Smac mimetic-mediated sensitization of pancreatic carcinoma cells for gemcitabine-induced apoptosis. The Smac mimetic BV6 cooperates with gemcitabine to reduce cell viability and to induce apoptosis. In addition, BV6 significantly enhances the cytotoxicity of several anticancer drugs against pancreatic carcinoma cells, including doxorubicin, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil. Molecular studies reveal that BV6 stimulates NF-kappaB activation, which is further increased in the presence of gemcitabine. Importantly, inhibition of NF-kappaB by overexpression of the dominant-negative IkappaBalpha superrepressor significantly decreases BV6- and gemcitabine-induced apoptosis, demonstrating that NF-kappaB exerts a proapoptotic function in this model of apoptosis. In support of this notion, inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) by the TNFalpha blocking antibody Enbrel reduces BV6- and gemcitabine-induced activation of caspase 8 and 3, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and apoptosis. By demonstrating that BV6 and gemcitabine trigger a NF-kappaB-dependent, TNFalpha-mediated loop to activate apoptosis signaling pathways and caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death, our findings have important implications for the development of Smac mimetic-based combination protocols in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
