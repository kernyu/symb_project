Enteric fever due to Salmonella Paratyphi A (SPA) is a global problem occurring as outbreaks at times. An unusual SPA (2,12:a:-) variety durazzo has been reported rarely. We report an outbreak of enteric fever due to this variety affecting 43 individuals. The blood samples grew unusual mucoid, lactose non-fermenting colonies with atypical biochemical reactions in sugar fermentation and amino acid decarboxylation. Isolates had sensitivity to ceftriaxone, chloramphenical, cotrimoxazole, intermediate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and resistance to ampicillin and nalidixic acid. Identification was confirmed as SPA (2,12:a:-) at the National Salmonella Centre.
