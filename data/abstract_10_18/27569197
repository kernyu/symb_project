New classes of drugs are needed to treat tuberculosis (TB) in order to combat the emergence of resistance (MDR and XDR) to existing agents and shorten the duration of therapy. Mycobacterial DNA gyrase B subunit has been identified to be one of the potentially under exploited drug targets in the field of antitubercular drug discovery. In the present review, we discussed the synthesis, structural optimization and docking study of effective potent DNA gyrase inhibitor against M. tuberculosis, with improved properties such as enhanced activity against MDR strains, reduced toxicity. Based on this progress, if we can successfully leverage the opportunities in this target, there is hope that we will be able to raise novel gyrase inhibitor in earnest in the long.
