We describe the case of a 52-year-old woman with scleritis caused by an imipenem-resistant strain of Nocardia beijingensis. The patient presented with pain, redness, and nodules on the sclera of 8 weeks' duration. A Gram stain from a nodule on the superonasal aspect of the globe was initially negative. After empiric treatment for an autoimmune etiology, cytopathology confirmed filamentous bacteria. A presumptive diagnosis of Nocardia scleritis was made, and medical management was based on a literature review on treatments for Nocardia infections. Cultures returned confirming Nocardia beijingensis. Antibiotic sensitivity testing confirmed the correct initial management. The patient's scleritis resolved with a good visual outcome.
