BACKGROUND: One of the main problems in the treatment of cases of P. aeruginosa especially in the orthopedic infections is the occurrence of high antibiotic resistance. The present study was carried out in order to investigate the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant P. aeruginosa in the cases of trauma in Iran. METHODS: Two hundred and fifty swab samples were collected from the site of trauma from the patients who referred to the orthopedic wards of the Iranian health centers. Samples were cultured immediately and those that were P. aeruginosa-positive were analyzed by the disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Of 250 swab samples collected, 43 were positive for P. aeruginosa (17.2%). The results of the culture technique were also confirmed by the PCR reaction. Of 43 P. aeruginosa isolates, 32 strains (74.41%) were resistant to vancomycin. Total prevalence of bacteria in Tehran and Mashhad hospitals were 18.46% and 15.83%, respectively. Statistically significant difference was seen for the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant P. aeruginosa between the samples collected from Tehran and Mashhad (P =0.027). More than 55 years old and less than 10 years old patients had the highest prevalence of P. aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa strains of male and more than 55 years old patients harbored the highest levels of resistance against vancomycin. CONCLUSIONS: It is logical to primary identification of type of bacteria causing infection in the site of trauma and then using from the disk diffusion method to choose the best antimicrobial agent. Highest levels of health care should be performed for the patients less than 10 years and more than 55 years old patients.
