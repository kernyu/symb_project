In the conditions of high relative density of multidrug resistant tuberculosis in Ukraine, rapid diagnostics of M. tuberculosis susceptibility to antituberculous drugs is the important tool in treatment of patients with lung tuberculosis. 78 patients with lung TB that were treated in TB dispensary in Kharkiv during 2004-2005 years were analyzed. Mutations in 531 codon of rpoB gene of isolates M. tuberculosis were studied. Among 48 (61.5%) resistant isolates of M tuberculosis according to phenotypic method, mutations were found only at 29 (60.4%) isolates. Among 30 (38.5%) phenotypic sensitive M. tuberculosis isolates only 1 (3.3%) isolate had mutation in rpoB gene M. tuberculosis.
