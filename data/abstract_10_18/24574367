PURPOSE: Uncomplicated, recurrent urinary tract infections (RUTIs) in heal-thy, premenopausal women are a common health complaint. This article discusses risk factors, diagnostic techniques, medical management, and referral information to help clinicians manage RUTIs in the primary care setting. DATA SOURCES: This article cites research articles, systematic reviews, and current guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of RUTIs in healthy premenopausal women can be managed by using individualized plans of care. Referrals are usually not useful nor cost effective. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This article discusses treatments based on increasing antimicrobial resistance and examines nonmicrobial options in RUTI prevention. This article serves as a foundation for guiding primary care providers in managing this common problem using current research and guidelines.
