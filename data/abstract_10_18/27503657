Among 230 target-synthesized indole-based compounds, seven 3-triazenoindoles showed MICs of 0.2 to 0.5 mug/ml against Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain H37Rv and isoniazid-resistant human isolate CN-40. The TU112 compound was active also against a dormant form of M. tuberculosis Some of these triazenoindoles were active against Mycobacterium avium, with MICs of 0.05 to 0.5 mug/ml. The selectivity indices (SI) for M. tuberculosis and M. avium were significantly higher than 10, making these compounds acceptable for the next testing step.
