BACKGROUND: Enterobacter is a common nosocomial microorganism and its carbapenem's resistance has increased. The management of these cases is unclear. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated 16 patients with KPC-producing Enterobacter aerogenes infections, detailing the site of infection, therapy, clinical and epidemiological data. METHODS: A retrospective and descriptive study. Clinical data were revised and KPC-2 detection was by molecular methods. Risk factors associated with mortality were compared using appropriate tests according to variable type with a significance level of 0.05. RESULTS: The 30-day mortality rate was 37.5% with no association with inadequate treatment. Age (p=0.004) and Charlson score of comorbidities (p=0.048) were independent risk factors associated with death in the multivariate analysis. The odds ratio for age >43 years was 3.00 (95% CI: 1.02-9.32) and for Charlson score >3 was 2.00 (95% CI: 1.08-3.71). Five strains were pan-resistant based on automated susceptibility tests. All patients were treated with monotherapy. CONCLUSION: The clinician should be alert to carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae infection in older patients with comorbidities. The mortality is high and we believe that prompt and adequate therapy must be employed.
