BACKGROUND: Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) can progress to Henoch-Schonlein purpura nephritis (HSPN), and the most effective management remains unclear. Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for treating pediatric patients with HSPN and nephrotic-range proteinuria. METHODS: Twelve children, seven boys and five girls, mean age 8.33 (range 6-12) years at the time of HSPN diagnosis with nephrotic-range proteinuria, were treated with MMF. All patients failed steroid treatment, and mean proteinuria at the time of MMF initiation was 5.6 g/d. MMF dosage ranged from 20 to 25 mg/kg per day. Patients also received an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (cliazapril) at MMF initiation. Mean follow-up was 3.9 (range 2.3-5.5) years. RESULTS: All patients responded to MMF at a mean of 2.5 (range 1-4 months). Among the 12 patients, MMF was administered for 10 months in five, 12 months in six, and 15 months in one. At last follow-up, all patients had negative proteinuria and normal renal function, and no relapses were noted. No serious adverse effects of MMF were noted in any patient. CONCLUSION: MMF is useful for treating pediatric patients with HSPN and nephrotic-range proteinuria.
