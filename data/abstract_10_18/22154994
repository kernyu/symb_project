BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae is an emerging problem worldwide. The object of this study was to investigate the risk factors, characteristics and outcomes of ertapenem-nonsusceptible K pneumoniae (ENSKp) bacteremia. METHODS: We conducted a 1:2 ratio matched case-control study. The controls were randomly selected among patients with ertapenem-susceptible K pneumoniae (ESKp) bacteremia and were matched with ENSKp cases for bacteremia. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were included in this study (25 cases and 50 controls). Bivariate analysis showed that prior exposure to either beta-Lactam/beta-Lactam-lactamase inhibitors (p = 0.008) or 4(th) generation cephalosporins (p < 0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (p = 0.001), acute renal failure (p = 0.021), chronic kidney disease without dialysis (p = 0.021), recent hospital stay (p = 0.016), intensive care unit stay (p = 0.002), mechanical ventilation (p = 0.003), central venous catheter placement (p = 0.016), Foley indwelling (p = 0.022), polymicrobial bacteremia (p = 0.003) and higher Pittsburgh bacteremia score (p < 0.001) were associated with ENSKp bacteremia. The multivariate analysis showed that prior exposure to 4(th) generation cephalosporins (odds ratio [OR], 28.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.92-269.85; p = 0.004), COPD (OR, 21.38; 95% CI, 2.95-154.92; p = 0.002) and higher Pittsburgh bacteremia score (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.10-1.66; p = 0.004) were independent factors for ENSKp bacteremia. ENSKp bacteremia had a higher 14-day mortality rate than ESKp bacteremia (44.0% vs. 22.0%; p = 0.049). The overall in-hospital mortality rates for these two groups were 60.0% and 40.0% respectively (p = 0.102). CONCLUSION: ENSKp bacteremia had a poor outcome and the risk factors were prior exposure of 4(th) generation cephalosporins, COPD and higher Pittsburgh bacteremia score. Antibiotic stewardship may be the solution for the preventive strategy.
