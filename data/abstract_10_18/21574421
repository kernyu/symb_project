The efficacy of levofloxacin and moxyfloxacin vs. the previously tested fluoroquinolones was studied on albino mice with experimental plague due to the Nal(r) mutants of Yersinia pestis 231 and 231 FI-. The plague microbe mutants resistant to nalidixic acid (Nal(r)) generated at a frequency of 10(-10)-10(-9). The resistance to nalidixic acid was not accompanied by the strains loss of the virulence. The Nal(r) mutants were cross resistant to fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, moxyfloxacin). The LD50 for the nontreated animals did not differ from that for the mice treated with nalidixic acid and the fluoroquinolones (when the animals were infected with Nal(r) mutants). The results showed that the criteria of the plague microbe susceptibility/resistance to fluoroquinolones should be revised.
