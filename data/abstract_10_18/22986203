The prevalence and characteristics of non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) in retail ground meat from the Washington D.C. area were investigated in this study. STEC from 480 ground beef and pork samples were identified using PCR screening followed by colony hybridization. The STEC isolates were serogrouped and examined for the presence of virulence genes (stx1, stx2, eae and hlyA), and antimicrobial susceptibility. PFGE was used to identify the clonal relationships of STEC isolates, and PCR-RFLP was employed to determine stx subtypes. In addition, the cytotoxicity of STEC isolates was determined using a Vero cell assay. STEC were identified in 12 (5.2%) of 231 ground pork and 13 (5.2%) of 249 ground beef samples. Among 32 STEC isolates recovered from the 25 samples, 12 (37.5%) carried stx2dact and 7 (21.9%) carried hlyA, but none carried eae. Nine isolates were identified as O91, and 17 (53.1%) isolates were resistant to two or more antimicrobials. Verotoxicity was detected in 26 (81.3%) of the STEC isolates. Thus, the retail ground meat was contaminated with a heterogeneous population of non-O157 STEC, some of which were potential human pathogens.
