A glycopeptide-resistant Enterococcus faecium (EFRG) was isolated from a wound in a patient hospitalized in a university hospital in Algiers. This strain was resistant to several antibiotics. This patient was carrying this strain in the digestive tract which may partly explain its origin. Genotypic comparison of the two strains by pulsed field gel electrophoresis showed that it was the same strain. Glycopeptide resistance was due to the presence of the vanA gene. Vigilance is required facing the emergence of strains of EFRG in our hospitals.
