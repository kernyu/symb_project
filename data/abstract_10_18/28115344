We report on the coexistence of mcr-1 and blaCTX-M in multidrug-resistant, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli belonging to the sequence type 10 complex isolated from well water in rural China. Raoultella ornithinolytica with blaKPC-2 was also detected in well water from the same area. This study shows that genes coding for resistance to last-resort antibiotics are present in wells in rural China, indicating a potential source of antibiotic resistance.
