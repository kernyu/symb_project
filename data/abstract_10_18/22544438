The main threat to controlling malaria is the emerging multidrug resistance of Plasmodium sp. parasites. Bis-alkylamidines were developed as a potential new chemotherapy that targets plasmodial phospholipid metabolism. Unfortunately, these compounds are not orally available. To solve this absorption issue, we investigated a prodrug strategy based on sulfonate derivatives of alkylamidoximes. A total of 25 sulfonates were synthesized as prodrug candidates of one bis-N-alkylamidine and of six N-substituted bis-C-alkylamidines. Their antimalarial activities were evaluated in vitro against P. falciparum and in vivo against P. vinckei in mice to define structure-activity relationships. Small alkyl substituents on the sulfonate group of both C-alkyl- and N-alkylamidines led to the best oral antimalarial activities; alkylsulfonate derivatives are chemically transformed into the corresponding alkylamidines.
