Influenza is a continuing world-wide public health problem that causes significant morbidity and mortality during seasonal epidemics and sporadic pandemics. The existing vaccination program is variably effective from year to year, and drug resistance to available antivirals is a growing problem, making the development of additional antivirals an important challenge. Influenza virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is the centerpiece of the viral response to the host interferon (IFN) system. NS1 was demonstrated previously to be a potential therapeutic target for antiviral therapy by the identification of specific small-molecule inhibitors. One inhibitory compound, NSC125044, was subjected to chemical evaluation. Initial synthetic work comprised simplifying the core structure by removing unwanted functionality and determination of key features important for activity. Several subclasses of molecules were designed and synthesized to further probe activity and develop the basis for a structure-activity relationship. Apparent potency, as judged by activity in virus replication assays, increased dramatically for some analogs, without cytotoxicity. Results suggest that the target binding site tolerates hydrophobic bulk as well as having a preference for weakly basic substituents.
