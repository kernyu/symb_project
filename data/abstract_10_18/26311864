Fluoroquinolone resistance is a serious and increasingly common problem in Salmonella. Two companion studies in this issue of the Journal of Clinical Microbiology (E. Deak, R. Skov, J. A. Hindler, and R. M. Humphries, J Clin Microbiol 53:3405-3410, 2015, http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JCM.01393-15; R. Skov, E. Matuschek, M. Sjolund-Karlsson, J. Ahman, A. Petersen, M. Stegger, M. Torpdahl, and G. Kahlmeter, J Clin Microbiol 53:3411-3417, 2015, http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JCM.01287-15) provide data to support the use of pefloxacin disk diffusion as a convenient and inexpensive surrogate laboratory method to detect fluoroquinolone resistance in Salmonella when the direct measurement of fluoroquinolone MICs is not feasible [corrected]. Recently updated CLSI and EUCAST susceptibility breakpoints will help to optimize clinical outcomes and reduce the likelihood of emergent resistance.
