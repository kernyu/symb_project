Inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) have improved the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). However, chronic drug exposure may trigger resistance, limiting the utility of these agents. The metastatic behavior of RCC cells, susceptible (RCC(par)) or resistant (RCC(res)) to the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus, was investigated. Adhesion to vascular endothelium or immobilized collagen and fibronectin was quantified. Chemotactic motility was evaluated with a modified Boyden chamber assay. Integrin alpha and beta subtype receptors were analyzed by flow cytometry and Western blot analysis. The physiological relevance of the integrins was then determined by blocking studies and small interfering RNA knockdown. Adhesion to endothelial cells and to fibronectin (not to collagen) and chemotaxis were enhanced in RCC(res) compared to RCC(par). RCC(res) detached from fibronectin and motile activity further increased under retreatment with low-dosed temsirolimus. alpha5 integrin was diminished inside the cell and at the cell surface, whereas the beta3 subtype was reduced intracellularly but elevated at the plasma membrane. In RCC(par), blocking alpha5 surface receptors enhanced RCC-collagen but reduced RCC-fibronectin interaction, whereas the opposite was true for RCC(res). Chemotaxis of RCC(par) but not of RCC(res) was strongly diminished by the alpha5 antibody. Blocking beta3 significantly lowered chemotaxis with stronger effects on RCC(res), compared to RCC(par). Importantly, beta3 knockdown reduced chemotaxis of RCC(par) but upregulated the motile behavior of RCC(res). Temsirolimus resistance is characterized by quantitative alterations of integrin alpha5 and beta3 expression, coupled to functional changes of the integrin molecules, and forces a switch from RCC adhesion to RCC migration.
