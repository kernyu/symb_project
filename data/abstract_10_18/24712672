Trichomoniasis is a common sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by a protozoan parasite called Trichomonas vaginalis. This disease, with roughly 170 million new infected people worldwide per year, is associated with various problems such as pre-term delivery, high infant mortality or low birth weight. In addition, trichomoniasis increases patient susceptibility to HIV infection. The mainstay medication for trichomoniasis is metronidazole, but some resistant strains to this treatment have been identified. Moreover, treatment with metronidazole is associated with numerous side effects. Thus efforts to identify new alternative drugs in order to control trichomoniasis are vital. The use of medicinal herbs has gained widespread acceptance in both developing and non-developing societies because of owing to fewer side effects and better patient tolerance. In our search for alternative drugs in the treatment of trichomoniasis, we reviewed the effect of different plant extracts on Trichomonas vaginalis in vitro.
