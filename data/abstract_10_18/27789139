Metabolic Syndrome, also referred to as 'Syndrome X' or 'Insulin Resistance Syndrome,' remains a major, unmet medical need despite over 30years of intense effort. Recent research suggests that there may be a causal link between this condition and abnormal glucocorticoid processing. Specifically, dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis leads to increased systemic cortisol concentrations. Cushing' syndrome, a disorder that is also typified by a marked elevation in levels of cortisol, produces clinical symptomology that is similar to those observed in MetS, and they can be alleviated by decreasing circulating cortisol concentrations. As a result, it has been suggested that decreasing systemic cortisol concentration might have a positive impact on the progression of MetS. This could be accomplished through inhibition of enzymes in the cortisol synthetic pathway, 11beta-hydroxylase (Cyp11B1), 17alpha-hydroxylase-C17,20-lyase (Cyp17), and 21-hydroxylase (Cyp21). We have identified a series of novel sulfonamide analogs of (2S,4R)-Ketoconazole that are potent inhibitors of these enzymes. In addition, selected members of this class of compounds have pharmacokinetic properties consistent with orally delivered drugs, making them well suited to further investigation as potential therapies for MetS.
