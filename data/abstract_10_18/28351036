Chemotherapy is widely used in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment, yet multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major chemotherapeutic obstacle in both resectable and advanced NSCLC. Epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 (EGFL7), also known as vascular endothelial stain, is an endothelial cell-derived secreted factor that regulates vascular tube formulation. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential relationships between EGFL7 and MDR in NSCLC cells. We first obtained the CDDP-based MDR phenotype cell line A549/CDDP by repeated exposure to a proper concentration of CDDP (cisplatin) from original A549 cells. These A549/CDDP cells, which maintained relative high levels of EGFL7 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), were resistant to other chemotherapy drugs, such as carboplatin (CBP), paclitaxel (TAX), and gemcitabine (GEM) (p < 0.05). We also found that hypoxia significantly reduced the chemosensitivity of NSCLC cells, and hypoxia-induced MDR was mediated by P-gp and EGFL7 (p < 0.05). EGFL7 was veryy relevant to NSCLC cell MDR, and downregulation of EGFL7 could significantly increase the chemosensitivity of NSCLC cells (p < 0.05). Thus, our findings first indicate that hypoxia induced NSCLC cell MDR at least partly by enhancing the expression of EGFL7 protein. EGFL7 might be a feasible target for reversing hypoxia-mediated MDR in NSCLC cells and a promising biomarker for predicting the development of MDR in NSCLC patients on chemotherapy.
