Aspergillus terreus-induced invasive infections exhibit high lethality, partly due to the intrinsic resistance for amphotericin B (AmB). We compared the virulence and pathogenesis of an AmB-resistant isolate of A. terreus (ATR) with that of a rare variant showing enhanced sensitivity for AMB (ATS). The modifications that result in enhanced AmB sensitivity of isolates are not associated with reduced virulence in vivo; instead, the ATS-infected mice died even faster than the ATR-infected animals. Since A. terreus enters the blood stream in most patients and frequently induces thrombosis, we studied a putative correlation between virulence of the two A. terreus isolates and their effect on thrombocytes. Those mice infected with the more virulent ATS isolate had lower thrombocyte numbers and more phosphatidylserine exposure on platelets than ATR-infected mice. In vitro experiments confirmed that ATS and ATR differ in their effect on thrombocytes. Conidia, aleurioconidia and hyphae of ATS were more potent than ATR to trigger thrombocyte stimulation, and thrombocytes adhered better to ATS than to ATR fungal structures. Furthermore, ATS secreted more soluble factors that triggered platelet stimulation than ATR. Thus, it might be suggested that the capacity of a fungal isolate to modulate thrombocyte parameters contributes to its virulence in vivo.
