Infections due to caspofungin-resistant Candida isolates in patients exposed to caspofungin therapy are increasing. We report here a nested case-control study which aimed at identifying factors associated with bloodstream infections caused by Candida spp. having reduced susceptibility to caspofungin (CRSC) in adults suffering from hematological malignancies. In univariate and multivariate analyses, infections with CRSC were associated with caspofungin exposure in the previous 30 days (odds ratio [OR] = 5.25; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.68-16.35) and with an age of </= 65 years (OR = 3.27; 95% CI, 1.26-8.50).
