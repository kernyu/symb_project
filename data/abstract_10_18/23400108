BACKGROUND: Enterococci have emerged in recent years as important nosocomial pathogens. Although most enterococcal human infections are caused by Enterococcus faecalis, studies on vancomycin resistance are usually limited to Enterococcus faecium isolates and a little is known about E. faecalis. Therefore we undertook this study to obtain information about the prevalence of vancomycin -resistant E. faecalis (VREF) and genes responsible for resistance. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety-one E. faecalis isolates of different patients admitted at Children's Medical Center from August 2009 to June 2010 were included in this cross-sectional study. Antimicrobial testing was performed by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method according to Clinical Laboratories Standards Institute (CLSI). RESULTS: Among all isolates, 15 (16%) were identified as VR E. faecalis. PCR analysis revealed that all VREF isolates were positive for the vanA gene. CONCLUSION: The present study reports the highest range of VREF in Iran. The increased frequency of VREF, as seen with rapid rise in the number of VanA isolates should be considered in infection control practices.
