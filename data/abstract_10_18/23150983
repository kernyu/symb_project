A series of 2-(substituted phenyl/benzyl-amino)-6-(4-chlorophenyl)-5-(methoxycarbonyl)-4-methyl-3,6-dihydrop yrimidin-1-ium chlorides 7-13 and 15 was synthesized in their hydrochloride salt form. The title compounds were characterized by FT-IR, NMR ((1)H and (13)C) and elemental analysis. They were evaluated for their in vitro antitubercular activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, multidrug resistance tuberculosis and extensively drug resistance tuberculosis by agar diffusion method and tested for the cytotoxic action on peripheral blood mononuclear cells by MTT assay. Among all the tested compounds in the series, compounds 7 and 11 emerged as promising antitubercular agents at 16 mug/mL against multidrug resistance tuberculosis and over 64 mug/mL against extensively drug resistance tuberculosis. The conformational features and supramolecular assembly of the promising compounds 7 and 11 were determined by single crystal X-ray study.
