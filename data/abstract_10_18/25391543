OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to identify predictors for the response to treatment of acute lupus hemophagocytic syndrome (ALHS). METHODS: We reviewed seven cases with ALHS admitted to our hospital and published ALHS cases identified in the 2001-2014 Medline database, and then conducted univariate and multivariate analyses to identify predictors for the response to treatment. RESULTS: Review of our cases showed a significant and negative correlation between serum ferritin and anti-DNA antibody (p = 0.0025). All three patients treated with cyclosporine A (CsA) were considered responders despite high serum ferritin and corticosteroid resistance. We also reviewed 93 patients with ALHS identified in 46 articles. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified C-reactive protein (CRP) (OR 0.83, p = 0.042) and hemoglobin (OR 1.53, p = 0.026) measured at diagnosis of ALHS as significant predictors of the response to corticosteroid monotherapy. Moreover, among 32 patients treated with CsA, serum ferritin was significantly higher in CsA responders (12163 +/- 16864 microg/l, n = 22) than in non-responders (3456 +/- 6267/microg/l, p = 0.020, n = 10). Leukocyte count was significantly lower in the CsA responders (1940.0 +/- 972.3/microl) than in the non-responders (3253 +/- 2198/microl, p = 0.034). CONCLUSION: Low CRP and high hemoglobin can predict a positive response to corticosteroid monotherapy while high serum ferritin and low leukocyte count can predict a positive response to CsA in patients with ALHS and therefore, when corticosteroid monotherapy is not effective in such cases, CsA could be the first choice of an additional immunosuppressive agent.
