Invasive fungal infections in immunocompromised children are common and often fatal. The first antifungal agents such as amphotericin B and fluconazole offered effective treatment, but their use was often limited by toxicity and resistance. Numerous new antifungal agents have since been developed and appear to be as effective. Most dosing and safety trials have been done in adults, and extrapolation of this data to children has proven inadequate. We reviewed the literature regarding the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) and safety of antifungal agents with an emphasis on the newer azoles and echinocandins. From a small but growing number of PK/PD trials, better dosing guidelines have been developed.
