OBJECTIVE: To analyze the profile of antimicrobial susceptibility of meningococcal disease isolates collected throughout Brazil from 2006 to 2008 and forwarded to the National Reference Laboratory for Meningitis, Institute Adolfo Lutz - Sao Paulo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MIC to penicillin, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin and rifampicin was determined in a sample of 1096 (55% of the total isolates received) randomly chosen using the broth microdilution procedure. The breakpoints used were those recommended by the European Monitoring Group on Meningococci (EMGM). RESULTS: Decreased susceptibility to penicillin and ampicillin was detected in 13% and 12.9% respectively. All isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin. Two strains (0.2%) showed high resistance to rifampicin and 0.5% of the isolates displayed intermediate resistance to rifampicin. CONCLUSIONS: The meningococcal strains isolated in Brazil during 2006-2008 were globally susceptible to all antibiotics currently used in treatment or chemoprophylaxis of meningococcal disease in Brazil.
