Influenza A virus encodes an integral membrane protein, A/M2, that forms a pH-gated proton channel that is essential for viral replication. The A/M2 channel is a target for the anti-influenza drug amantadine, although the effectiveness of this drug has been diminished by the appearance of naturally occurring point mutations in the channel pore. Thus, there is a great need to discover novel anti-influenza therapeutics, and, since the A/M2 channel is a proven target, approaches are needed to screen for new classes of inhibitors for the A/M2 channel. Prior in-depth studies of the activity and drug sensitivity of A/M2 channels have employed labor-intensive electrophysiology techniques. In this study, we tested the validity of electrophysiological measurements with solid-supported membranes (SSM) as a less labor-intensive alternative technique for the investigation of A/M2 ion channel properties and for drug screening. By comparing the SSM-based measurements of the activity and drug sensitivity of A/M2 wild-type and mutant channels with measurements made with conventional electrophysiology methods, we show that SSM-based electrophysiology is an efficient and reliable tool for functional studies of the A/M2 channel protein and for screening compounds for inhibitory activity against the channel.
