We report on 3 immunocompromised children infected with pandemic influenza A/H1N1/2009 in whom mixtures of oseltamivir-susceptible and oseltamivir-resistant viral populations developed, despite them receiving relatively short-term courses of oseltamivir. In addition, it was found that bacterial coinfections were common, indicating that empiric, antibiotics should be considered in such patients when infected with influenza virus.
