Initiated in April 2008 Polish multicenter study HEP2008 aimed clinical data concerning safety and efficacy of adefovir dipivoxil (ADV, Hepsera, Gilead Sciences) in adult chronically infected HBV with lamivudine (LAM) resistance after earliest treatment. We examined 38 men (70.4%) and 16 women (29.6%) with chronic hepatitis B in age 23-81 (average 53) mostly HBeAg positive (70.4%). Majority of patients received earlier LAM (72%), but others additional entekawir and\ or pegylated interferon. Average time from discovering infection HBV was 95 +/- 77 (10-307) months. Majority of patients received monotherapy ADV, but physicians decided at 12 (22%) persons about continuation of LAM therapy. Median HBV DNA level decreased from a baseline value 6.73 +/- 1.71 (1.8-9.0) to 3.25 log10 copies/mL. At least HBV DNA drop 1 log10 and 2 log10 get 78.8 and 60.6% in 24 week, 84.8 and 69.7% in 48 week. HBV DNA reduction below level 300 and 50 copies/mL it observed in 15.2 and 6.1% in 24 week, 39.4 and 30.3% in 48 week. Patients with undetectable Mean ALT activity dropped significantly and were below limit norm at 24 week in 40%, and at 48 week in 58% of patients. Patients treated ADV and LAM reached great reduction of ALT activity but was no influence on HBV DNA reduction. Results of research have confirmed efficiency and safety 48-week's therapy ADV in patients with LAM resistance.
