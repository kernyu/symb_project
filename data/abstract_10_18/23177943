Staphylococcus epidermidis is the most prevalent species of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS). It accounts for over 65% of all staphylococci isolated from samples. In recent years the increasing relevance of CNS as pathogens is evident, mainly causing bacteraemia and prosthetic device infection. Linezolid, being an effective antibiotic against this pathogen, and due to its ease of use and oral posology, is becoming the treatment of choice in outpatients. However, the continued use of this drug is causing the development of resistant strains. We describe a prosthetic infection due to linezolid resistant S. epidermidis that appeared in a patient who had been previously treated with this drug for 16 days due to the isolation of Bacillus sp. This case was not related to a resistant strain hospital outbreak.
