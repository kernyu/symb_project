The ability of various combination disk tests (CDTs) incorporating avibactam to detect OXA-48 carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae was evaluated. The CDT using 30-mug temocillin alone and supplemented with 5-mug avibactam showed good performance and could be an adjunctive test to the classic CDT containing class A and class B carbapenemase inhibitors for the positive discrimination of OXA-48 carbapenemase producers from carbapenemase-negative strains.
