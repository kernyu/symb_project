Salmonella enterica serotype 1, 4, [5 ], 12: i:- ( Salmonella 1, 4, [5], 12: i:-), an emerging serotype antigenically related to Salmonella Typhimurium (1,4, [5], 12 : i:1,2) but lacking the second phase flagellar antigen, has been frequently detected in many countries over the last 10 years. Nowadays it seems to be one of the major serotypes responsible for human salmonellosis cases worldwide. In addition, multidrug resistance is quite common in Salmonella 1, 4, [5],12:i:-, the two major clones (labelled as Spanish and European clones) show multidrug resistance to four or more unrelated classes of antimicrobials mediated by plasmids or chromosome. Some resistance determinants including bla(TEM), bla(CTX-M(-1), aac(3)-IV, aadA2, cmlA1, sul1, sul2, dfrA12, strA-strB, tet (A) and tet (B) have been found in these multidrug resistance strains. The genomic characterization of 1,4, [5] ,12:i:- isolates suggests that this serovar is likely to gather several clones or strains that have independently emerged from S. Typhimurium, and have changed through multiple independent events involving different clonal groups. In later study, emphasis should be paid on development of rapid and precise detection methods and study of pathogenic and resistance mechanisms of Salmonella 1,4, [5] ,12:i:-.
