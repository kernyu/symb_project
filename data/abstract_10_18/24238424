Antibiotic resistance has become a critical health issue on a global scale, with much of the problem resulting from inappropriate use of antibiotics in primary care. To change this practice, the global respiratory infection partnership has formulated a pentagonal (five P) framework for the non-antibiotic management of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) - one of the most common conditions in primary care for which antibiotics are prescribed. The framework presents the rationale for focusing on URTIs to promote antibiotic stewardship in primary care and elaborates on five key areas to focus on to bring about change: policy, prevention, prescribers, pharmacy and patients. The ultimate aim is to adopt a patient-centred symptomatic management strategy using a flexible framework that can be adapted across countries to create a consistent global approach to change behaviour.
