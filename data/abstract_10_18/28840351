Limited data are available on temocillin susceptibilities in Enterobacteriaceae from Asian countries where antimicrobial resistance is prevalent. The in vitro activities of temocillin and 15 commonly used antimicrobials against 613 non-duplicate blood (n = 310) and urine (with clinically significant bacteriuria; n = 303) isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from patients who attended 3 out of 7 clusters of public hospitals of the Hospital Authority, Hong Kong, during 2015/2016 were tested. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) microbroth dilution (agar dilution with fosfomycin). For temocillin, MICs were also obtained using the British Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) microbroth dilution method and interpreted using the BSAC breakpoints. Overall, 93.0% (570) isolates were susceptible to temocillin using BSAC systemic breakpoint (</=8 mg/L) and all except 2 isolates were susceptible using the urinary breakpoint (</=32 mg/L). The extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) positivity rate was 23.2% (118 out of 508 E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp.). Temocillin resistance rate to ESBL-positive isolates was 16.1% using the systemic breakpoint of </=8 mg/L (MIC50 and MIC90 were 8 mg/L and 16 mg/L respectively). Two isolates (1 E. coli, temocillin MIC 64 mg/L, 1 Klebsiella sp., MIC 32 mg/mL) were resistant to meropenem and possessed the NDM-5 and KPC-2 genes respectively. Other susceptibility rates were: amoxicillin/clavulanate (59.1%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (62.5%), ciprofloxacin (71.5%), ceftriaxone (75.4%), nitrofurantoin (76.4%), gentamicin (78.3%), cefepime (81.1%), ceftazidime (83.5%), piperacillin/tazobactam (86%), colistin (88.8%), tigecycline (89.4%), fosfomycin (92.8%), ertapenem (99.0%), amikacin (99.2%) and meropenem (99.7%). Temocillin may be a useful alternative for the treatment of infections caused by ESBL and multi-drug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in Hong Kong, particularly as resistance rates to ciprofloxacin, nitrofurantoin and piperacillin/tazobactam are high.
