BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is widespread, abhorrently under-diagnosed, and radically under-treated. Globally, infection with HCV is a major cause of acute hepatitis and chronic liver disease. Therefore, novel HCV inhibitors are required for the treatment of the HCV infected patients. OBJECTIVE AND PERSPECTIVES: This review gives the detailed knowledge of upcoming therapy such as NS5B polymerase inhibitors that are urgently needed. CONCLUSION: In the past decade, intensive hard work has focused on the discovery of both structural and nonstructural inhibitors of the HCV NS5B polymerase. These demanding efforts have resulted in various promising agents advancing in clinical development with emphasis on clinical efficacy and impact for future combination studies.
