In Spain, the rate of anti-HBc positive, HBsAg-negative carriers is approximately 10% of adults between the ages of 26 and 65 years. It is therefore impossible to exclude these donors without increasing the mortality of recipients on waiting lists. The incidence of de novo hepatitis B infection in HBsAg-negative recipients of anti-HBc-positive donors is high without prophylaxis and is related to the serological state of the recipient against HBV. Anti-HBc and anti-HBs-positive recipients have low risk, with or without prophylaxis. This patient group therefore does not require prophylaxis but rather periodic posttransplantation checkups. For the other recipient groups (naive, anti-Hbc and anti-HBs isolates), prophylaxis with IgG HB, lamivudine or combined therapy decreases the incidence of infection. These patients should be treated with prophylaxis immediately after transplantation. Depending on the risk, cost and benefit, patients should currently be treated with lamivudine 100mg/d indefinitely or for longer periods (>10 years). Periodic checkups of HBsAg should be conducted, and if there is graft dysfunction then HBV DNA should be checked. IF HBV DNA is discovered in the donor and found to be positive in serum or in the biopsy, the prophylaxis should be an analogue with a high barrier to resistance from the start. Grafts from anti-HBc-positive donors are not considered at-risk grafts and are used according to donor severity, without being determined by the recipient's serological profile.
