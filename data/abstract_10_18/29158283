Resistance to antimicrobials is a growing problem in both developed and developing countries. In nations where AIDS is most prevalent, the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans is a significant contributor to mortality, and its growing resistance to current antifungals is an ever-expanding threat. We investigated octapeptin C4, from the cationic cyclic lipopeptide class of antimicrobials, as a potential new antifungal. Octapeptin C4 was a potent, selective inhibitor of this fungal pathogen with an MIC of 1.56 mug/ml. Further testing of octapeptin C4 against 40 clinical isolates of C. neoformans var. grubii or neoformans showed an MIC of 1.56 to 3.13 mug/ml, while 20 clinical isolates of C. neoformans var. gattii had an MIC of 0.78 to 12.5 mug/ml. In each case, the MIC values for octapeptin C4 were equivalent to, or better than, current antifungal drugs fluconazole and amphotericin B. The negatively charged polysaccharide capsule of C. neoformans influences the pathogen's sensitivity to octapeptin C4, whereas the degree of melanization had little effect. Testing synthetic octapeptin C4 derivatives provided insight into the structure activity relationships, revealing that the lipophilic amino acid moieties are more important to the activity than the cationic diaminobutyric acid groups. Octapeptins have promising potential for development as anticryptococcal therapeutic agents.
