Propamidine is an aromatic diamidine compound. In the current study, baseline sensitivity of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum to propamidine was determined using 78 strains collected from the oilseed rape fields without a previous history of propamidine usage. The median effective concentration (EC50) values for propamidine inhibiting mycelial growth ranged from 0.406 to 3.647mug/mL, with a mean of 1.616+/-0.217mug/mL. There was no correlation between sensitivity to propamidine and sensitivity to dimethachlon or carbendazim. After treated with propamidine, mycelia were thinner with irregular distortion and more branches; cell wall became thicker with uneven distribution of cytoplasm than untreated control. In addition, sclerotia production, cell membrane permeability and oxalic acid content significantly decreased. On detached oilseed rape leaves, propamidine exhibited better control efficacy than carbendazim at the same concentration whether the leaves were inoculated with carbendazim-sensitive or resistant strains. All the results showed that propamidine exhibited strong antifungal activity and potential application in controlling S. sclerotiorum. Importantly, these data will provide more information on understanding the mode of action of propamidine against S. sclerotiorum and should be valuable for development of new antifungal drugs.
