OBJECTIVE: To understander Neisseria meningitides (Nm) and antimicrobial susceptibility through analyzing the pathogens surveillance meningistis (ECM) cases and Nm carrier rate in healthy people in 2008. METHOD: Nm strains were isolated, identified and tested of specimens of cerebrospinal fluid and serum were analyzed by real-time. RESULTS: Seven Nm strains were isolated from ECM cases and close 4 serogroup C.44 Nm strains were isolated from 2323 healthy persons. strains include 11 serogroup A (25.00%), 16 serogroup B (36.36%), other serogroups (29.55%). The carrier rate was highest among the There is no significant statistical difference between males and females CONCLUSION: Serogroup C and B were the dominant strains in ECM cases province. In healthy people, serogroup B was the dominant strain, C. Surveillance of pathogens and Nmantimicrobial susceptibility test strategies mainly based on vaccination should be strengthened.
