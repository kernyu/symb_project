Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are a potentially serious threat to elderly people living in longterm care facilities. Therefore, the European HALT (Healthcare-associated infections in long-term care facilities) project was launched in 2008. HAIs and the use of antibiotics were studied in all 40 nursing homes (100% response) in the city of Frankfurt am Main, Germany, from January to March 2011, using the HALT protocol. Of the 3,732 residents in the homes, 4.3% (n=161) had either signs or symptoms of infections and/or were on oral antibiotics. The most common infections were urinary tract infections (n=45; 1.2%), followed by infections of the respiratory tract (n=41; 1.1%) and skin except mycosis (n=25; 0.7%). The overall prevalence of oral antibiotic use was 2.4% (n=90). The most frequently prescribed oral antibiotics were quinolones (n=31), cephalosporins (n=19), penicillins (n=11) and co-trimoxazole (n=11). The prevalence of HAIs was about the same as that in a European pilot study carried out in November 2009 (5%), but was higher than in several national surveys carried out between May and September 2010 (1.6-3.6%).
