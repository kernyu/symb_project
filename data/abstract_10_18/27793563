Antibiotics inhibiting protein translation have long been used to treat and prevent infections by apicomplexan parasites. These compounds kill parasites by inhibiting organellar translation, and most act specifically against the apicoplast, a relict plastid in apicomplexans. Drug resistance in Plasmodium and other apicomplexans dictates a need for development of novel targets. Some apicoplast inhibitors have a delayed onset of action, so they cannot replace fast-acting drugs, although they still fulfil important roles in treating and preventing infections. The plethora of bacterial-like actors in the translation machinery of parasite mitochondria and plastids presents validated targets with strong potential for selectivity. Here we discuss existing drugs that inhibit organellar translation, and explore targets that may be further exploited in antiparasitic drug design.
