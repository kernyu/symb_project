Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive intracellular pathogen that causes a severe invasive disease. Upon infecting a host cell, L. monocytogenes upregulates the transcription of numerous factors necessary for productive infection. VirR is the response regulator component of a two-component regulatory system in L. monocytogenes In this report, we have identified the putative ABC transporter encoded by genes lmo1746-lmo1747 as necessary for VirR function. We have designated lmo1746-lmo1747 virAB We constructed an in-frame deletion of virAB and determined that the DeltavirAB mutant exhibited reduced transcription of VirR-regulated genes. The DeltavirAB mutant also showed defects in in vitro plaque formation and in vivo virulence that were similar to those of a DeltavirR deletion mutant. Since VirR is important for innate resistance to antimicrobial agents, we determined the MICs of nisin and bacitracin for DeltavirAB bacteria. We found that VirAB expression was necessary for nisin resistance but was dispensable for resistance to bacitracin. This result suggested a VirAB-independent mechanism of VirR regulation in response to bacitracin. Lastly, we found that the DeltavirR and DeltavirAB mutants had no deficiency in growth in broth culture, intracellular replication, or production of the ActA surface protein, which facilitates actin-based motility and cell-to-cell spread. However, the DeltavirR and DeltavirAB mutants produced shorter actin tails during intracellular infection, which suggested that these mutants have a reduced ability to move and spread via actin-based motility. These findings have demonstrated that L. monocytogenes VirAB functions in a pathway with VirR to regulate the expression of genes necessary for virulence and resistance to antimicrobial agents.
