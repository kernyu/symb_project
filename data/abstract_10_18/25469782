Bloodstream infections due to Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) are becoming more frequent and are associated with a high mortality. At present, combination antimicrobial therapy yields the best outcomes, but treatment options are limited. Many bacteria utilize heparan sulfate to bind to human cells. We studied the ability of a biomimetic device composed of polyethylene beads with endpoint-attached heparin to bind both sensitive and (CRE) E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae from spiked blood samples. Greater than 90% of susceptible, E. coli, CRE E. coli and CRE Klebsiella were removed by the beads. Future studies in human bacteremia with this technology are planned.
