Understanding the relationship between antibiotic exposure and amplification of bacterial subpopulations with reduced drug susceptibility over time is important for evaluating the adequacy of dosing regimens. We utilized a hollow-fiber infection model to identify the fosfomycin intravenous dosing regimens that prevented the amplification of Escherichia coli bacterial subpopulations with reduced fosfomycin susceptibility. The challenge isolate was E. coli ATCC 25922 (agar MIC with glucose-6-phosphate, 1 mg/liter; agar MIC without glucose-6-phosphate, 32 mg/liter). The fosfomycin dosing regimens studied were 1 to 12 g every 8 h for 10 days to approximate that planned for clinical use. The studies included a no-treatment control regimen. Two bacterial subpopulations were identified, one with reduced susceptibility with agar MIC values ranging from 32 to 128 mg/liter and the other resistant with agar MIC values of 256 to >1,024 mg/liter on plates containing 5x and 256x the baseline MIC value, respectively. An inverted-U-shaped function best described the relationship between the amplification of the two bacterial subpopulations and drug exposure. The lowest fosfomycin dosing regimen that did not amplify a bacterial subpopulation with reduced susceptibility was 4 g administered every 8 h. Nearly immediate amplification of bacterial subpopulations with reduced susceptibility was observed with fosfomycin dosing regimens consisting of 1 to 2 g every 8 h. These data will be useful to support the selection of fosfomycin dosing regimens that minimize the potential for on-therapy amplification of bacterial subpopulations with reduced susceptibility.
