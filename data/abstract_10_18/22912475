Prevalence and antimicrobial resistance profiles of Salmonella serotypes isolated from 7 chicken meat brands produced by different integrated broiler operations in Korea were determined. In total, 210 samples were collected from retail supermarkets in Seoul, South Korea, and analyzed for the presence of Salmonella. Of 210 chicken meat samples, overall Salmonella prevalence was 22.4%. Salmonella Enteritidis was the dominant serovar, with an isolation rate of 57.4% from the Salmonella-positive chickens, followed by Salmonella Montevideo. Salmonella isolates frequently were resistant to various antibiotics, including 100% to erythromycin, 87% to cephalothin, 85% to nalidixic acid, and 70% to streptomycin. Of the 47 isolates, 41 (87.2%) isolates were resistant to 3 or more antibiotics. Moreover, the Salmonella profiles of each chicken meat brand were different by broiler operation. Brand A showed the highest prevalence of Salmonella (18 isolates, 60%), whereas brand G showed the lowest prevalence (one isolate, 3.3%). Eight among the 18 isolates of brand A were resistant to 11 antibiotics, whereas 5 of the 6 brand C isolates were resistant to only 2 antibiotics. This study demonstrates that a high proportion of chicken meat in Korea is contaminated with Salmonella and the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance patterns of Salmonella of chicken meat differ significantly according to the integrated broiler operation.
