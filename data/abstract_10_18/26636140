Aspergillus fumigatus is one of the most prevalent airborne fungal pathogens causing infections worldwide. Most A. fumigatus strains are susceptible to azoles, which are administered as the first line therapeutics. However, during last decade the acquired resistance to triazoles by these species has been described. There is a number of publications concerning the examination of clinical A. fumigatus strains from different countries, however there has been no report from Poland. Here, we describe for the first time, an examination of cyp51A and cyp51B expression level of 11 clinical A. fumigatus strains isolated during 2007-2014 period from the collection of Medical University in Wroclaw. Their susceptibility to itraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole has been examined. The MIC values of triazoles for one of the examined isolates were respectively: > 8 mg/L for itraconazole, 2 mg/L for voriconazole and 0.5 mg/L for posaconazole. The cyp51A gene with its promoter region of all isolates was sequenced. It was found that the resistant isolate harbors the TR34/L98H mutation in the cyp51A gene and when cultured on media supplemented with voriconazole exhibits overexpression of both, cyp51A and cyp51B genes. The level of cyp51A gene expression was about 50 times higher than cyp51B.
