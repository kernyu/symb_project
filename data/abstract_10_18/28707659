Steady growth in the degree of antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae calls for the control of the spreading of resistance mutations. Here we present the data describing drug resistance mutations, the results of antimicrobial susceptibility tests, and molecular genotypes of 128 recent N. gonorrhoeae isolates collected across 9 regions of the Russian Federation. The mutations in chromosome genes penA, ponA, rpsJ, gyrA, parC, which determine the susceptibility of N. gonorrhoeae to penicillins, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones were detected by multiplex amplification followed by hybridization on a hydrogel microarray. The most frequent mutation was an insertion of an aspartate at position 345 of penA gene (76.6%), whereas mutations Leu421Pro in ponA gene, Val57Met in rpsJ gene, Ser91Phe in gyrA gene, Asp95Gly in gyrA gene, and Ser87Arg in parC gene were detected in 32.8-36.7% of strains. One third of studied N. gonorrhoeae isolates harbored multiple drug resistance mutations in bacterial chromosome, resulting in the bimodal distribution of mutation profiles and related patterns of antimicrobial susceptibility. The spread of multiple resistance could be explained by the vertical transfer of the mutations resulting in the clonality of the N. gonorrhoeae population.
