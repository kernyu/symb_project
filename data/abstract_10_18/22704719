The aim of this study was to characterise CTX-M Escherichia coli isolates from cattle, chickens and turkeys in Great Britain with respect to CTX-M sequence type, replicon type, ability to transfer plasmids, and for the presence of antibiotic resistance, fitness and virulence genes as determined by micro-arrays. The main CTX-M enzymes identified in E. coli from cattle, chicken and turkeys were 14 and 15, 1 and 15, and 1 and 14 respectively. Most isolates from different animal species transferred their plasmids with similar frequencies. The plasmid replicon type I1-lambda was most common and seen in 23%, 95% and 50% of the isolates tested from cattle, chickens and turkeys respectively, whilst types F, FIA, FIB and K were common to isolates from cattle and turkeys only. Thirty-eight different antibiotic resistance genes were detected by micro-array including aad genes, blaCTX-M, blaTEM, cat genes dfrA, floR, strA, strB, sul, sul2 tetA and tetB. Thirty-nine different fitness and virulence genes were also detected by-micro-array, including espP, ireA, lpfA, mchF, prfB and tsh. Fisher exact test and hierarchical clustering of the antibiotic resistance and virulence gene results showed some genes were more commonly associated with isolates from chickens or cattle. This study provides a baseline of the characteristics of CTX-M E. coli isolates from animals in Great Britain and suggests that chicken and cattle CTX-M E. coli represent different populations.
