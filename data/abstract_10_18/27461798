The objective of this report was to document antimicrobial susceptibility testing surveillance data for ceftaroline and comparative agents from the AWARE (Assessing Worldwide Antimicrobial Resistance Evaluation) global surveillance program for bacterial pathogens causing skin and soft tissue and respiratory tract infections in African and Middle Eastern countries from 2012 through 2014. Pathogen identities were confirmed by MALDI-TOF and antimicrobial susceptibility testing performed by CLSI broth microdilution methodology in a central laboratory. All methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (n= 923; MIC90, 0.25 mug/mL) and 91.8% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (n= 1161; MIC90, 1 mug/mL) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. The maximum ceftaroline MIC observed for isolates of MRSA was 2 mug/mL. All Streptococcus pyogenes (n= 174; MIC90, 0.008 mug/mL), Streptococcus agalactiae (n= 44; MIC90, 0.015 mug/mL), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n= 351; MIC90, 0.25 mug/mL), and Haemophilus influenzae (n= 84; MIC90, </=0.015 mug/mL) were susceptible to ceftaroline. Rates of susceptibility to ceftaroline among ESBL-negative Escherichia coli (n= 338), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n= 241), and Klebsiella oxytoca (n= 97) were 89.1% (MIC90, 1 mug/mL), 94.2% (MIC90, 0.5 mug/mL), and 99.0% (MIC90, 0.5 mug/mL), respectively.
