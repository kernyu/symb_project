BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in dogs. The responsible bacterial populations have evolved with increasing resistance to many antimicrobials. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of canine urinary tract isolates over a 51-month period. ANIMALS: One thousand six hundred and thirty-six bacterial isolates from 1,028 dogs. METHODS: Aerobic bacterial isolate growth and susceptibility data from urine cultures of dogs were identified, retrospectively. Medical records were reviewed to obtain signalment, comorbidities, and antimicrobial use in the previous 30 days. The UTIs were further categorized as uncomplicated, complicated, or pyelonephritis. RESULTS: Common bacterial isolates identified were Escherichia coli (52.5%), Staphylococcus spp. (13.6%), and Enterococcus spp. (13.3%). In vitro susceptibility among all isolates varied for commonly prescribed antimicrobials (amoxicillin [59%], amoxicillin/clavulanic acid [76%], cephalexin [66%], enrofloxacin [74%] and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [86%]). For all antimicrobials tested (except aminoglycosides), in vitro susceptibility was higher in uncomplicated versus complicated infections (P < .05). Uncomplicated infection isolate susceptibility rates remained </=90% for PO administered antimicrobials. Administration of amoxicillin, doxycycline, and enrofloxacin, but not amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in the previous 30 days was associated with resistance to that antimicrobial. Multidrug resistant isolates of E. coli and Staphylococcus spp. were more common in dogs with complicated than uncomplicated UTIs (36% versus 21%, P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: In vitro susceptibility was highly variable and no PO administered antimicrobial had >90% efficacy among isolates tested. Multidrug resistance was frequent among isolates tested suggesting that routine culture and susceptibility testing is indicated. Previously prescribed antimicrobials may affect empirical choices made pending susceptibility testing.
