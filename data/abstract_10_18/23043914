OBJECTIVE: To assess the in vitro antibacterial activity of honey from different geographical location on Gram negative organisms. METHODS: Different concentrations (Undiluted honey, 10 %, 30%, 50% and 70% wt/vol) of honey were studied in vitro using Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes), briefly, two-fold dilutions of honey solutions were tested to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against each type of microorganism, followed by more assays within a narrower dilution range to obtain more precise MIC values. MICs were determined by both visual inspection and spectrophotometric assay at 620 nm. These honey samples were compared with standard antibiotics like ampicillin, penicillin G, amoxicillin, gentamycin, tobramycin, erythromycin and chloramphenicol was determined by the disc diffusion method. RESULTS: The diameter of zone of the inhibition (ZDI) of honey has various concentrations tested for the isolates ranged 0-46 mm for S. aureus, 0-44 mm for S. pyogenes. While the MIC (%) ranged 12%-95%, 25%-73% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Algeria honey, in-vitro, possess antibacterial activity.
