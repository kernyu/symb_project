This report is focused on a case of endogenous endophthalmitis following Streptococcus mitis bacteremia that occurred during chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia, despite broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics and vancomycin. The patient partially recovered visual acuity. In conclusion, Streptococcus mitis bacteremia complicated by febrile neutropenia may cause endogenous endophthalmitis within a very short timeframe.
