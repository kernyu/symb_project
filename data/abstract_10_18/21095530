The term pyoderma encompasses a variety of distinct entities including impetigo (bullous and nonbullous), erysipelas, cellulitis, folliculitis, and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Treatment of pyodermas centers around wound care and appropriate antibiotic selection. Triphenylmethane dyes, such as gentian violet, represent a unique group of compounds that act as antiseptics and have shown clinical efficacy as antibiotics in a variety of pyodermas, including those secondary to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Given their low cost, ease of application, and favorable side effect profile, triphenylmethanes must be considered legitimate treatment options for pyodermas, particularly in the face of continued and emerging bacterial resistance.
