BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori antimicrobial resistance is an important factor responsible for treatment failure. The purpose of this study was evaluating the prevalence of point mutations in clarithromycin-resistant clinical isolates of H. pylori in Isfahan city of Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty isolates of H. pylori from 130 biopsy specimens were isolated by culture and confirmed by biochemical and PCR tests. The MIC of clarithromycin antibiotic for 30 clinical isolates of H. pylori was determined by E-test method. The point mutations in the 288 bp of 23S rRNA gene of H. pylori were investigated in four clarithromycin-resistant clinical isolates by PCR followed by sequencing. RESULTS: Among 30 isolates of H. pylori, 4 cases were resistant to clarithromycin. One point mutation was found at position T2243C in the 23S rRNA gene in all resistance isolates. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, H. pylori resistance to clarithromycin associated with point mutation at position 2243 (T2243C).
