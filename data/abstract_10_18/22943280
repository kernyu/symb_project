INTRODUCTION: Ceftazidime is a third-generation cephalosporin that has activity against Gram-negative bacilli, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance and the limited number of antimicrobial agents in development have necessitated a review of the current status of treatments involving ceftazidime. AREAS COVERED: This review focuses on studies examining the in vitro antibacterial activity of ceftazidime against recent clinical isolates and recent randomized controlled trials studying the clinical efficacy of ceftazidime, and discusses strategies for the optimal use of ceftazidime for treating respiratory tract infections, mainly hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). EXPERT OPINION: Although ceftazidime remains an important option for HAP treatment, its role as an effective antimicrobial agent has been compromised by the sharp increase in resistance rates over the last decade, especially in P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. To maintain or improve the clinical use of ceftazidime in patients with severe HAP, it will be essential to gain a thorough understanding of local resistance patterns, reserve ceftazidime use when pathogens are susceptible to other third-generation cephalosporins, optimize ceftazidime therapy using prolonged or continuous infusion, determine the effectiveness of the combination of ceftazidime with inhibitors of broad-spectrum beta-lactamases and role of combination therapy for P. aeruginosa infections, and judiciously use antimicrobial agents through individualization of antimicrobial therapy for HAP.
