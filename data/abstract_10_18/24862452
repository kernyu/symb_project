The role of zinc finger proteins in organismal stress conditions has been widely reported. However, little is known concerning the function of CCHC-type zinc finger proteins in rice. In this study, OsZFP6, a rice CCHC-type zinc finger protein 6 gene, was cloned from rice using RT-PCR. The OsZFP6 protein contains 305 amino acids and a conserved zinc finger domain and is localised to the nucleus. Southern blot analysis revealed that a single copy was encoded in the rice genome. OsZFP6 expression was increased by abiotic stress, including salt (NaCl), alkali (NaHCO3) and H2O2 treatment. When OsZFP6 was transformed into yeast, the transgenic yeast showed significantly increased resistance to NaHCO3 compared to the control. Moreover, Arabidopsis transgenic plants overexpressing OsZFP6 were more tolerant to both NaHCO3 and H2O2 treatments. Overall, we uncovered a role for OsZFP6 in abiotic stress responses and identified OsZFP6 as a putatively useful gene for developing crops with increased alkali and H2O2 tolerance.
