Packing is the support medium for microbial adhesion and water retention, and its characteristics are directly related to the removal of pollutants. In the present study, three novel biotrickling packings were developed: polyhedral sphere, burr sphere and polyhedral hollow column. The results showed that the structural characteristics of polyhedral sphere and polyhedral hollow column, with the specific surface area of 200 m2 x m(-3), were better than those of traditional biotrickling packings. The resistance coefficient zeta of polyhedral sphere was almost identical before and after the biofilm formation. Under the same condition, zeta of burr sphere increased much more. Investigations on the start-up time showed that the polyhedral hollow columns could contribute more to the quick biofilm formation. The performance of BTF which was packed with polyhedral sphere was better than the others. When the inlet concentrations of toluene and ethanol were 687.37 and 651.17 mg x m(-3), the removal efficiencies achieved 76.78% and 99.23%, respectively. Biomass measurements showed that the biomass adhering on these packings were more than that on the common polypropylene Bauer ring. Biofilm could be renewed and removed easily from the polyhedral sphere and the pressure drop could maintain at 51.6 Pa x m(-1) at the later stable running phase. However, the pressure drop in the BTF which used burr sphere as the packings increased much more (193.3 Pa x m(-1)), thus causing a clogging phenomenon.
