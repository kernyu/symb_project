OBJECTIVE: To report clinicopathologic features, radiologic findings, and treatment outcomes of isolated, orbital aspergillosis. DESIGN: Multicenter, retrospective case series. METHODS: setting: Multicenter. PARTICIPANTS: There were 8 lesions in 8 eyes of 8 patients with isolated, orbital aspergillosis. PROCEDURE: Review of medical records and histopathology slides. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Disease control. RESULTS: Of 34 patients with orbital aspergillosis, 8 (23.5%) had isolated orbital involvement at presentation. The mean age at presentation was 34.5 years (median, 43 years: range, 0.5-72 years). Gradually progressive proptosis and eyelid swelling were the most common presenting features (each 4/8). Proptosis ranged from 4 mm to 9 mm (median, 5.5 mm; mean, 5.75 mm). Restriction of ocular motility was seen in all 8 patients. Other examination findings included palpable mass (2/8), conjunctival chemosis (2/8), hyperglobus (1/8), hypoglobus (1/8), and resistance to retropulsion (1/8). Microbial culture results were available in 1 patient and showed Aspergillus fumigatus. Two patients were treated with complete surgical excision alone while 6 were treated with antifungal medications. Complete resolution of proptosis and restoration of ocular motility were seen in all patients following treatment. Visual disturbances present in 1 were corrected following treatment. Recurrence was observed in 1 patient. CONCLUSION: Isolated orbital aspergillosis, though rare, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a patient presenting with a gradually progressive orbital mass, especially in Asian individuals. Early recognition will help reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease.
