Antibiotic resistant bacteria are a global problem. Drug resistance may spread rapidly due to mobile resistance genes shared by many species. The selection of resistant bacteria is promoted by ever increasing human and veterinarian use of antibiotics. A new paradigm in fighting drug-resistant hospital bacteria is needed to stop the vicious circle of drug-resistance and bring back antibiotic susceptible bacteria. Less antibiotics and more infection control by an improved compliance with hand hygiene is the choice left to minimize the spread of hospital infections with drug resistant bacteria.
