Aim: The aim of our study was polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of the genes responsible for the multiple antibiotic resistance S. aureus isolated from food of animal origin in Egypt. Materials and Methods: A total of 125 samples were randomly collected from milk, meat, and their products from Giza and Beni-Suef Governorates markets. The S. aureus isolates were subjected to antimicrobial sensitivity tests using four antibacterial disks (Oxoid), and then the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed for detection of antibiotic resistance genes. Results: Out of 125 samples, 19 S. aureus isolates were detected. All detected isolates were multiple drug resistance (MDR). The penicillin-, erythromycin-, kanamycin-, and tetracycline-resistant isolates were examined by PCR for resistance genes blaZ, (msrA, ermB, and ermC), aac(6')aph (2"), and tetK. The isolates harbored these resistance genes with percentage of 100% (100%, 0%, and 100%), 62.5%, and 100%, respectively. Conclusion: Contaminated foods of animal origin may represent a source of MDR S. aureus that can be a major threat to public health.
