The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are focused heavily on curbing the misuse of antibiotics in health care facilities.

Savvy pharmacists are embracing this opportunity to engage long-term care facility staff to improve the care of their residents.
