Despite infection control measures, an important increase in the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae incidence density occurred in our hospital from 2006 onwards. This study, focusing on the 2005-2007 period, was performed in an attempt to explain this increase. ESBLs were characterized, isolates were typed by ERIC2-PCR, and sequence type (ST) of clustered isolates was determined. Temporal-spatial relationships of patients were analysed to assess possible cross-contamination. Of the 74 ESBL-producing isolates, 30 (40%) were detected at admission, 53 (715%) produced CTX-M enzymes, 40 displayed unique ERIC2-PCR profiles and 34 were assigned into six clusters: ST16 (n=21), ST101, ST48, ST35, ST13, and ST436. Relationships were identified in 22 of the 34 patients harbouring clustered isolates. This study highlights the complex epidemiology of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae in the mid-2000s with potential cross-contamination for only 30% of the 74 patients in our hospital, and the emergence of clones that are currently spreading worldwide.
