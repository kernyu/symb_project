The bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) gene has been identified as a candidate gene for disease-resistance breeding. We evaluated whether polymorphisms in exons 4 and 10 of the BPI gene are associated with immune indices [interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-6, interferon-b (IFN-b), IL-10, and IL-12]. In this study, we identified one mutation (C522T) in the BPI exon 4 site and two mutations (A1060G and T1151G) in the BPI exon 10 site. Correlation analysis revealed that in the Sutai pig population, the effect of genotypes at the BPI exon 4 site on the level of IL-6 was significant (P < 0.05), with an effective genotype of CD; moreover, the effect of genotypes at the BPI exon 10 site on the level of IL-12 was significant (P < 0.05), and the effective genotype was AB. The optimal combined genotype was CD-AB, which was more effective regarding the IL-6 and IL-12 levels compared to the other combined genotypes (P < 0.05). These results indicate that single nucleotide polymorphisms and the combined genotypes of BPI exons 4 and 10 affect immune indices in Sutai pigs. Therefore, these genotypes should be further examined as effective markers for disease-resistant breeding of pigs.
