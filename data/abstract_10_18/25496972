Emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a major public health concern worldwide. The current study aims to determine the antimicrobial resistance in N. gonorrhoeae and associated molecular typing to enhance gonococcal antimicrobial surveillance in Hungary. In the National N. gonorrhoeae Reference Laboratory of Hungary 187 N. gonorrhoeae infections were detected in 2013, antibiograms were determined for all the isolated strains, and 52 (one index strain from every sexually contact related group) of them were also analysed by the N. gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequence typing (NG-MAST) method. Twenty-two different NG-MAST sequence types (STs) were identified, of which 8 STs had not been previously described. In Hungary, the highly diversified gonococcal population displayed high resistance to penicillin, ciprofloxacin and tetracycline (the antimicrobials previously recommended for gonorrhoea treatment). Resistance to the currently recommended extended spectrum cephalosporines were rare: only two of the expected strains, an ST 1407 and an ST 210, had cefixime MIC above the resistance breakpoint. By the revision of our National Treatment Guideline, it must be considered, that the azithromycin resistance is about 60% among the four most frequently isolated STs in Hungary.
