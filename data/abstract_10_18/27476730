The prevalence of enterococci was examined in 280 milk samples collected from dairy cattle diagnosed with mastitis in three provinces of western China. Sixty strains of enterococci were isolated, and the species were determined based on their biochemical characters and 16S rRNA sequences. Resistance to seven antibiotic agents, frequency of seven virulence genes and pathogenicity in Kunming mice were tested to evaluate biological risks. The correlation between the number of virulence genes and pathogenicity in Kunming mice was also evaluated. The 60 isolates were allocated to Enterococcus hirae (68.3%), E. faecium (25.0%), E. mundtii (3.3%) and E. durans (3.3%). A total of 83.3% of the isolates were resistant to penicillin, whereas 15.0% were resistant to ampicillin, 15.0% to vancomycin, 6.7% to tetracycline and 25.0% to ciprofloxacin. Moreover, isolates exhibited 50.0% and 21.7% resistance to high levels of gentamycin and streptomycin, respectively. The gene asa1 was detected in all enterococcal isolates, whereas 66.7% of strains harbored three or more virulence factors and 56.7% were asa1-ccf-gelE-positive. In pathogenicity tests, isolates harboring numerous virulence factors did not show greater invasiveness than isolates harboring fewer virulence traits against Kunming mice. In conclusion, the number of virulence factors does not appear to predict the risk of enterococcal infection. Isolates were commonly resistant to penicillin and sporadically to ampicillin and vancomycin. These results suggest that the use of gentamycin, streptomycin and ciprofloxacin against enterococci should be avoided in mastitic cows. Additionally, the results demonstrate that the majority of isolates are sensitive to tetracycline.
