PURPOSE: We report a case of mycotic keratitis caused by a rare fungus Schizophyllum commune. METHODS: Clinical examination, slit-lamp examination, and microbiological evaluation of the corneal ulcer were done, and its treatment outcome was studied. The fungal etiology was established by conventional microbiological techniques, polymerase chain reaction and speciation by DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Corneal scraping showed the presence of fungal filaments. The fungus was identified as S. commune based on DNA sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region. The organism was susceptible to amphotericin B and voriconazole and demonstrated resistance to anidulafungin, itraconazole, and fluconazole. Therapeutic keratoplasty was performed but there was recurrence of the infection in the graft, which was controlled with topical voriconazole and intracameral amphotericin B. At the end of 3 months, the affected eye had developed phthisis bulbi. CONCLUSION: The best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of keratitis caused by the rare fungus S. commune. Management of these cases is difficult, and surgical procedures may be needed.
