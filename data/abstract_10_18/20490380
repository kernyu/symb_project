Fungal infections are an increasingly frequent problem in oncohematological patients with febrile neutropenia and hematopoietic precursors transplant recipients. According to the definitions of the EORTC/MSG Consensus Group, the term invasive fungal infection (IFI) is preferred nowadays to name this group of infections. This aims at highlighting the complex disease resulting from a fungal infection involving higher morbidity, longer hospital stays, increased health care costs and higher mortality risk. Candidiasis and aspergillosis account for about 80% of IFIs in oncohematological patients, while Fusarium diseases, mucormycosis, among others, are emerging infections.
