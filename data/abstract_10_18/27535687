We assessed a novel immunochromatographic lateral flow assay for direct identification of OXA-48-like carbapenemases and accurate differentiation of allele variants with distinct substrate profiles (OXA-48 or OXA-163 subfamilies). The assay allowed rapid (less than 4 min) and reliable direct confirmation of OXA-163- and/or OXA-48-like enzymes (with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity) from cultured colonies that were recovered from both solid medium and spiked blood culture bottles.
