Antimicrobial resistance is a global health problem and antimicrobial stewardship is an essential component of hospital policies worldwide yet little is known regarding effective implementation strategies in the Middle East. We conducted a review of studies carried out in this region that deployed different antimicrobial stewardship strategies to assess antimicrobial appropriateness and prescribing behaviours. A search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, Google and Google Scholar was conducted. Twenty articles met the inclusion criteria; 2 studies evaluated strategies including prospective audit with feedback, while 18 others evaluated strategies including benchmarking antimicrobial utilization against guidelines. Recommendations for implementation of stewardship in the Middle East highlighted the importance of developing and updating local antimicrobial prescribing policies and using collaborative interdisciplinary approaches for success.
