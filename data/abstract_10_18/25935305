Leuconostoc lactis EFEL005 (KACC 91922) isolated from kimchi showed promising probiotic attributes; resistance against acid and bile salts, absence of transferable genes for antibiotic resistance, broad utilization of prebiotics, and no hemolytic activity. To expand our understanding of the species, we generated a draft genome sequence of the strain and analyzed its genomic features related to the aforementioned probiotic properties. Genome assembly resulted in 35 contigs, and the draft genome has 1,688,202 base pairs (bp) with a G+C content of 43.43%, containing 1,644 protein-coding genes and 50 RNA genes. The average nucleotide identity analysis showed high homology (>/= 96%) to the type strain L. lactis KCTC3528, but low homology (</= 95%) to L. lactis KCTC3773 (formerly L. argentinum). Genomic analysis revealed the presence of various genes for sucrose metabolism (glucansucrases, invertases, sucrose phosphorylases, and mannitol dehydrogenase), acid tolerance (F1F0 ATPases, cation transport ATPase, branched-chain amino acid permease, and lysine decarboxylase), vancomycin response regulator, and antibacterial peptide (Lactacin F). No gene for production of biogenic amines (histamine and tyramine) was found. This report will facilitate the understanding of probiotic properties of this strain as a starter for fermented foods.
