INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to assess cyclic fatigue resistance of reciprocating (Reciproc and WaveOne) and continuous rotating (ProTaper) nickel-titanium files after immersion in different irrigation solutions with or without surfactants during several short time periods. METHODS: A total of 270 new Reciproc R25, WaveOne Primary, and ProTaper F2 files were tested. Instruments of each brand were divided into 1 control group (n = 10) formed by new files and 4 test groups (n = 20) formed by instruments dynamically immersed at 37 degrees C for 16 mm in 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), Hypoclean (5.25% NaOCl with surfactant), 17% EDTA, or EDTA Plus (17% EDTA with surfactant). Each test group was subdivided into 2 subgroups (n = 10) on the basis of the time of dynamic immersion in the endodontic irrigant solution (45 seconds or 3 minutes). Resistance to cyclic fatigue was determined by recording time to fracture in a stainless steel artificial canal with a 60 degrees angle of curvature and 5-mm radius of curvature. The fracture surface was examined by using scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: Immersion in NaOCl did not reduce the cyclic fatigue of reciprocating or continuous nickel-titanium files. The 17% EDTA reduced the fatigue resistance of all instruments after 3 minutes. The immersion in irrigants with surfactants did not influence the cyclic fatigue of instruments except for Reciproc immersed in Hypoclean solution. CONCLUSIONS: EDTA immersion reduced the cyclic fatigue resistance of all instruments after 3 minutes. Addition of surfactants did not influence the cyclic fatigue of files except when added to NaOCl when it contacts Reciproc instruments.
