One hundred and twenty six Salmonella Enteritidis isolates recovered from 1152 retail raw poultries were characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility test, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), presence of quinolone resistance (Qnr) associated genes, Class I integron, extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) encoding genes, and mutations in quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) of GyrA and ParC. Resistance was most frequently found to nalidixic acid (88.1%), followed by to tetracycline (65.9%), sulfisoxazole (65.1%), and ampicillin (61.9%), and a less extent to cefoxitin (8.7%), gatifloxacin (8.7%), levofloxacin (7.9%), ceftriaxone (7.1%), and ceftiofur (6.3%). One hundred and twenty three (98.4%) isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic, and 93 (74.4%) to at least four antibiotics. aac(6')-Ib-cr, qnrB, qnrA and qnrS genes were detected in 15 (11.9%), 11 (8.7%), 6 (4.8%) and 1 (0.8%) isolates, respectively. Amino acid substitutions of Ser83Tyr, Asp87Asn, Asp87Tyr, Asp87Gly and Ser83Phe/Asp87Asn were detected in QRDR of GyrA, Arg80Ser was the unique mutation in ParC. Eight isolates were detected with amino acid substitution both in GyrA and ParC. Three isolates carried Class I integron that harboring dfrA17-aadA5, dhfR1-aadA1, and dfrA1, respectively. Five isolates were detected carrying bla(TEM)-bla(ACC) (n = 1), bla(TEM) (n = 1), bla(TEM)-bla(OxA) (n = 3), respectively. Genetic diversities (D = 0.9255) were found among isolates based on PFGE analysis.
