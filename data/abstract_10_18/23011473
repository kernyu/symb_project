This study evaluated the influence of eugenol on the push-out bond strengths of fiber posts cemented with different types of resin luting agents. Seventy-two extracted maxillary single-rooted canine teeth were randomly divided into two groups of 36 teeth. Group 1, the control group, was filled with gutta-percha only (i.e., did not receive eugenol), whereas group 2 was filled with a eugenol-containing sealer. All root canals were filled and each group was divided into three subgroups. The posts in each subgroup were cemented with the following materials: subgroup 1 with a 2-step self-etching adhesive system (Clearfil Liner Bond 2V + Panavia F); subgroup 2 with a 1-step self-etching adhesive (Panavia F); and subgroup 3 with a self-adhesive (Clearfil SA Cement). Dislodgement resistance was measured using a universal testing machine. All data were subjected to ANOVA using a factorial design and Tukey test (alpha = 0.05). The use of the eugenol-containing sealer significantly reduced the push-out bond strength of the fiber post (P < 0.05). The push-out bond strength of Panavia F was significantly higher than those of the other groups filled with the eugenol-containing sealer (P < 0.05). The Panavia F group was less susceptible to the inhibiting effect of eugenol than were the other evaluated groups when the fiber post was cemented in the canals filled with the eugenol-containing sealer.
