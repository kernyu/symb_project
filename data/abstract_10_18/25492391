OBJECTIVES: Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) is an important healthcare-associated pathogen. We evaluated the impact of CRKP strain type and treatment on outcomes of patients with CRKP bacteriuria. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Physician-diagnosed CRKP urinary tract infection (UTI)-defined as those patients who received directed treatment for CRKP bacteriuria-was studied in the multicentre, prospective Consortium on Resistance against Carbapenems in Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRaCKle) cohort. Strain typing by repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR (rep-PCR) was performed. Outcomes were classified as failure, indeterminate or success. Univariate and multivariate ordinal analyses to evaluate the associations between outcome, treatment and strain type were followed by binomial analyses. RESULTS: One-hundred-and-fifty-seven patients with physician-diagnosed CRKP UTI were included. After adjustment for CDC/National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN)-defined UTI, critical illness and receipt of more than one active antibiotic, patients treated with aminoglycosides were less likely to fail therapy [adjusted OR (aOR) for failure 0.34, 95% CI 0.15-0.73, P=0.0049]. In contrast, patients treated with tigecycline were more likely to fail therapy (aOR for failure 2.29, 95% CI 1.03-5.13, P=0.0425). Strain type data were analysed for 55 patients. The predominant clades were ST258A (n=18, 33%) and ST258B (n=26, 47%). After adjustment for CDC/NHSN-defined UTI and use of tigecycline and aminoglycosides, infection with strain type ST258A was associated with clinical outcome in ordinal analysis (P=0.0343). In multivariate binomial models, strain type ST258A was associated with clinical failure (aOR for failure 5.82, 95% CI 1.47-28.50, P=0.0113). CONCLUSIONS: In this nested cohort study of physician-diagnosed CRKP UTI, both choice of treatment and CRKP strain type appeared to impact on clinical outcomes.
