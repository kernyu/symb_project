Hepatic complications currently represent one of the leading reasons for medical consultations, hospitalisation, and death in the HIV-infected population. This is due to a large extent to viral hepatitis, given its disproportionate frequency in this population. Chronic hepatitis B affects 5-10% of the HIV-infected population. Vaccination has reduced the incidence of liver disease related to hepatitis-B virus (HBV), and the availability of tenofovir has dramatically improved the prognosis of HIV/HBV carriers. Delta hepatitis affects around 15% of HIV-infected individuals in Europe harbouring positive HBsAg. It has the worst prognosis, given its accelerated course to cirrhosis and the absence of successful therapy. Lastly, chronic hepatitis C is the major cause of liver disease in the HIV population. Although classically linked to persons infected parenterally (i.e., intravenous drug users), outbreaks of acute hepatitis C among homosexual men have been reported over the last decade. Treatment with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin provides a cure in less than 40% of patients. However, the introduction of new direct acting antivirals against hepatitis- C virus (HCV) (telaprevir, boceprevir) has revolutionised the field, as HAART did in 1996 in the HIV field, improving the prognosis of co-infected patients. However, interactions between these drugs and antiretroviral agents and the risk of selective resistance pose huge threats in this population.
