High-level resistance to mupirocin in meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) jeopardizes its role in nasal decolonization protocols. We carried out a study in 2010 to determine the prevalence of high-level mupirocin resistance in our tertiary-care hospital. The prevalence of high-level resistance to mupirocin in MRSA in this hospital was 11%. There was also complete agreement between the genotypic and phenotypic methods of detection of high-level mupirocin resistance in 24 of the screening isolates.
