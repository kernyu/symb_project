The 20th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) presented important highlights of advances in antiretroviral therapy. Investigators emphasized new approaches to finding a cure for HIV infection, with a special focus on an infant who received combination antiretroviral therapy at 30 hours of age and may have achieved a functional cure in the absence of continued antiretroviral therapy. Challenges and opportunities for sustainable antiretroviral therapy under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) were discussed, and investigators around the globe examined attrition through the cascade of care for HIV disease and its implications. Knowledge of barriers to antiretroviral therapy in resource-limited settings (RLSs) continues to expand, as do innovative strategies for improving antiretroviral therapy access and uptake in these settings. Encouraging results from expanded prevention of mother-to-child transmission programs, including option B+, were presented. Prevalence of transmitted (primary) drug resistance appears to be increasing in the United States, and new detection techniques may increase access to resistance testing in RLSs.
