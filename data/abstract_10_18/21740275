In the present study, Listeria monocytogenes BCRC 14846 and Salmonella Typhimurium BCRC 10747 were subjected to acid adaptation at pH 5.5 at 37 degrees C for 1 and 4 h, respectively. The viability of the acid-adapted cells of test organisms exposed to Clidox-S, a chlorine-containing disinfectant, and Quatricide, a quaternary ammonium compound, was examined and compared with that of the control cells at 25 degrees C and 40 degrees C. Results revealed that acid adaptation significantly enhanced the viability of L. monocytogenes and Salmonella Typhimurium exposed to the disinfectants under investigation. Both pathogens examined were more susceptible to Clidox-S and Quatricide at 40 degrees C than at 25 degrees C. Further, L. monocytogenes was more susceptible to Quatricide than Salmonella Typhimurium, whereas Salmonella Typhimurium was more susceptible to Clidox-S than L. monocytogenes.
