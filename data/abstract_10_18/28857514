Pannonibacter phragmitetus is a bioremediation reagent for the detoxification of heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAHs) while it rarely infects healthy populations. However, infection by the opportunistic pathogen P. phragmitetus complicates diagnosis and treatments, and poses a serious threat to immunocompromised patients owing to its multidrug resistance. Unfortunately, genome features, antimicrobial resistance, and virulence potentials in P. phragmitetus have not been reported before. A predominant colony (31801) was isolated from a liver abscess patient, indicating that it accounted for the infection. To investigate its infection mechanism(s) in depth, we sequenced this bacterial genome and tested its antimicrobial resistance. Average nucleotide identity (ANI) analysis assigned the bacterium to the species P. phragmitetus (ANI, >95%). Comparative genomics analyses among Pannonibacter spp. representing the different living niches were used to describe the Pannonibacter pan-genomes and to examine virulence factors, prophages, CRISPR arrays, and genomic islands. Pannonibacter phragmitetus 31801 consisted of one chromosome and one plasmid, while the plasmid was absent in other Pannonibacter isolates. Pannonibacter phragmitetus 31801 may have a great infection potential because a lot of genes encoding toxins, flagellum formation, iron uptake, and virulence factor secretion systems in its genome. Moreover, the genome has 24 genomic islands and 2 prophages. A combination of antimicrobial susceptibility tests and the detailed antibiotic resistance gene analysis provide useful information about the drug resistance mechanisms and therefore can be used to guide the treatment strategy for the bacterial infection.
