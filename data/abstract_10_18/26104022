BACKGROUND: With markedly increased antibiotic resistance and unsatisfactory efficacies of common empiric eradication regimens in the mainland of China, tailored therapy may be the best choice to achieve good efficacy. This study compared the eradication rates, safety, and compliance of tailored therapy to those of triple therapy plus bismuth and concomitant therapy in the naive patients with Helicobacter pylori infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between September 2013 and April 2014, 1050 patients with H. pylori infection at three tertiary hospitals were randomly assigned to 10-day treatment with tailored, triple plus bismuth, or concomitant regimens. In tailored therapy, medications were adjusted according to clarithromycin sensitivity and cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2C19 genotype. The antimicrobial susceptibility testing (E test) was performed. Eradication status was assessed 4-12 weeks after treatment. RESULTS: The eradication rate was significantly higher in tailored group than in triple plus bismuth and concomitant groups in both intention-to-treat (88.7 vs 77.4 vs 78.3%, p < .001) and per-protocol (93.3 vs 87.0 vs 87.4%, p = .021) analyses in a setting with high antibiotic resistance (clarithromycin 48.8%, metronidazole 65.7%, and dual resistance 35.3%). Significantly, fewer adverse effects occurred in tailored group than in concomitant group (22.0 vs 31.7%, p = .018). The eradication rates of dual clarithromycin and metronidazole resistance, isolated clarithromycin resistance, isolated metronidazole resistance, and dual susceptible were 78.7, 82.4, 94.8, and 94.4% in triple therapy plus bismuth and 75.9, 87.2, 92.9, and 95.2% in concomitant therapy, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: First-line tailored therapy achieves significantly higher eradication rates and fewer side effects, compared to triple therapy plus bismuth and concomitant therapy in a setting with high rates of clarithromycin and metronidazole resistance.
