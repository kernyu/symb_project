Yunnan, Guangxi and Henan are the provinces with the most severe HIV epidemic in China, which were also among the first group of areas providing free ART in 2004. However, little comprehensive data are available on prevalence of HIV subtype and baseline drug resistance in drug-naive populations. In this study, 1746 treatment-naive HIV-positive individuals were randomly selected from new-reported cases in Henan, Guangxi and Yunnan. Among of them, subtypes and drug resistance of 1159 strains were determined by amplifying and sequencing full-length pol genes. Significantly different distributions of HIV subtypes prevalent in three provinces were identified (P<0.01). CRF08_BC was found dominant in Yunnan (59.8%), while CRF01_AE was dominant in Guangxi (77.3%) and subtype B was dominant in Henan province (93.9%). The total prevalence of drug resistance was 7.1%. The highest prevalence of HIV drug resistance was found in Henan (12.2%), followed by Yunnan (5.6%) and Guangxi (3.3%). The results of this study suggest that genetic drug-resistance should be tested before initiation of ART in China, especially in Henan province. Furthermore, the prevalence of HIV drug resistant strains should be considered separately in different areas in China before the change of different free ART regimens.
