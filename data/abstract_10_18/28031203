A novel PER-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, PER-8, was identified in an Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolate obtained in Nepal. The amino acid sequence of PER-8 has a substitution at position 39 (Gly to Glu) compared with that of PER-7. The kcat/Km ratio of PER-8 for aztreonam was lower than that of PER-7, while the kcat/Km ratio of PER-8 for imipenem was higher than that of PER-7. The genomic environment surrounding blaPER-8 was intI1 blaPSE-1qacEDI sulI ISCR1-blaPER-8gts sulI orfX on a 100-kb plasmid.
