The antimicrobial susceptibility test is generally performed in clinical laboratories for detecting antimicrobial resistant bacteria. In contrast, the molecular tests include many investigative factors, they are not performed in many clinical laboratories routinely. If it is intimately related to the choice of the antimicrobial agents, it should be introduced as a routine clinical laboratory test. This test is also useful for conducting active surveillance and investigating the cause and occurrence of nosocomial infections.
