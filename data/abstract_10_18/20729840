Caenorhabditis elegans is an important model organism in biology, but until now no antibiotic selection markers have been successfully demonstrated for this species. We have developed a selection system using puromycin that allows the rapid and easy isolation of large populations of transgenic worms. This approach is sufficiently powerful to select single-copy transgenes, does not require any particular genetic background and also works in C. briggsae.
