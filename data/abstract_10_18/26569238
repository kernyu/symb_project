Over the last decades, the number of pathogenic multi-resistant microorganisms has grown dramatically, which has stimulated the search for novel strategies to combat antimicrobial resistance. Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is one of the promising alternatives to conventional treatments based on antibiotics. Here, we present a comparative study of two aryl tricationic porphycenes where photoinactivation efficiency against model pathogenic microorganisms is correlated to the photophysical behavior of the porphycene derivatives. Moreover, the extent of photosensitizer cell binding to bacteria has been assessed by flow cytometry in experiments with, or without, removing the unbound porphycene from the incubation medium. Results show that the peripheral substituent change do not significantly affect the overall behavior for both tricationic compounds neither in terms of photokilling efficiency, nor in terms of binding.
