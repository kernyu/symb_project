Clindamycin is increasingly used to treat canine pyoderma. Eight of 608 Staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolates were positive for inducible clindamycin resistance by double-disk diffusion testing and PCR detection of ermB. Staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolates that are erythromycin resistant but clindamycin susceptible by in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing should be tested for inducible clindamycin resistance.
