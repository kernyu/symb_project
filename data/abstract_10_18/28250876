INTRODUCTION: In 2001, the United Nations recommended that antiretroviral (ARV) drugs be made available in resource-limited countries. However, the use of these large-scale drugs is associated with the development of drug-resistant virus. In Ivory Coast, several health care/treatment centres prescribe antiretroviral drugs. This study aimed to evaluate the programmatic factors associated with high risk of emergence of HIV ARV drug resistance. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study involving 20 health care/treatment centres for people living with HIV. The study population consisted of patients who started HIV treatment at the health care/treatment centres in 2008-2009. Sample size calculation was based on WHO sampling method. RESULTS: Of the 20 health care/treatment centres, 98% of initial prescriptions were in accordance with national guidelines and 20% of health care/treatment centres had 100% of compliant prescriptions. In total, 33% of patients were lost to follow-up during the first 12 months of antiretroviral therapy and 20% of health care/treatment centres had less than 20% of patients lost to follow-up. At 12 months, 51% of patients were under appropriate first-line treatment and 11% of the health care/treatment centres reached the threshold of at least 70% of patients under appropriate first-line treatment. Only one health care/treatment centre didn't experienced an interruption in antiretroviral therapy over 12 months. CONCLUSION: Shortcomings in the treatment of people living with HIV justify the existence of a significant risk of viral resistance to antiretroviral drugs in 2008-2009. In order to minimize this risk prescribing practices should be improved, appointment reminder systems should be implemented and a constant availability of antiretroviral drugs should be ensured.
