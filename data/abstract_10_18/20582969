Corynebacterium jeikeium has been recognized as an important cause of infection, particularly among neutropenic patients who have central venous catheter (CVC). Routine use of tigecycline in children is not yet approved. Here in we present a child with relapsed-refractory lymphoblastic leukemia who was successfully treated with tigecyline due to multi-drug-resistant C. jeikeium sepsis without removal of CVC. Our case highlights the use of tigecycline where there are no alternatives. Further studies regarding the efficacy and safety of tigecycline in pediatric patients are needed.
