Due to the rapid onset of resistance to most antibacterial drugs, research efforts are focusing on new classes of antibacterials with different mechanisms of action from clinically used antibacterials. Pleuromutilin derivatives have received more and more scientific attention for their unique mechanism of action. Two pleuromutilin derivatives, tiamulin and valnemulin have been successfully developed as antibiotics for veterinary use. Retapamulin, another pleuromutilin derivative has been approved for use in humans in April 2007 by Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It has been shown that there is rarely cross-resistance between pleuromutilin derivatives and other antimicrobial agents, and the development of resistance bacterial is still low. This review will demonstrate mechanism of action of pleuromutilin derivatives and reveal the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of pleuromutilin derivatives. Additionally, the pleuromutilin antibacterial derivative agents in the market, such as tiamulin, valnemulin and retapamulin, will be discussed. It is proposed that new antibacterial agents might be developed from pleuromutilin derivatives in the future.
