Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium circulating in food animal populations and carrying resistance to antimicrobial agents represents a human health risk. Recently, a new clade of S. Typhimurium, WA-TYP035/187, was reported in cattle and humans in the Pacific Northwest, United States of America. The objective of this study was to describe a possible mechanism of acquisition of expanded-spectrum cephalosporin resistance in this clade. Ceftazidime resistance increased steadily among WA-TYP035/187 isolates, from 0% (0/2) in 1999 to 77.8% (28/36) in 2006 (chi2 for linear trend, P value of <0.001). Among 112 bovine-source and 18 human-source isolates, 49 (43.8%) and 12 (66.7%) were resistant to ceftazidime, respectively. Multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) and plasmid profiling suggested that resistance was acquired by multiple independent genetic events within the WA-TYP035/187 clade. Given the lack of an obvious reservoir in species other than cattle and a parallel rise in ceftiofur resistance in the bovine-specific serovar Salmonella enterica serovar Dublin in the same time frame and region, selection pressure due to the use of the expanded-spectrum cephalosporin drug ceftiofur in cattle is a likely factor driving the increasing cephalosporin resistance of WA-TYP035/187.
