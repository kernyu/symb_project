BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Resistance to antibiotics is common in patients with Helicobacter pylori infection in more than one anatomic stomach site. We assessed whether the antibiotic resistance varies according to virulence factors of the bacteria as well as to the age and gender of individuals infected in two anatomic sites. METHODS: H. pylori strains were isolated from an antral and corpus biopsy from 90 patients with gastric ambulatory who had not received any previous therapy. Susceptibility to metronidazole and clarithromycin was assessed by E-test, and vacA and cagA genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Dual resistance to metronidazole and clarithromycin was 3.3% in antrum and 4.4% in the corpus; heteroresistance was 19% and 5.5% for metronidazole and clarithromycin, respectively. Clarithromycin resistance significantly increased with age. Women showed a twofold increased risk for metronidazole-resistant strains in antrum (odds ratio = 2.85, 95% confidence interval 1.09 to 7.42). Virulence factors were not associated with antimicrobial resistance. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of resistance to clarithromycin may be increasing in this country. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests from different biopsy sites deserve attention.
