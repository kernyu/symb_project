Verocytotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC) is associated with a wide spectrum of disease from mild self-limiting diarrhoea to haemolytic uremic syndrome. Contaminated drinking water is accepted as an important route of transmission in Ireland as elsewhere however established methods for detection of VTEC in drinking water have limitations. We describe a sensitive and rapid method for detection of VTEC from large volumes (20 to 30L) of drinking water based on filtration, enrichment culture of filters and real-time PCR detection of VTEC virulence and O antigen determinants from enrichments. The method has potential applications for other waterborne pathogens.
