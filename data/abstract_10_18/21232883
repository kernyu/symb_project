To investigate the effects of rearing practices of commercial broiler chickens on the incidence of antimicrobial resistance in commensal Escherichia coli isolates, fecal E. coli isolates obtained in 4 farms were screened for anitimicrobial resistance. Ten E. coli isolates were recovered from each of the fecal samples collected from 10 birds in the farms at the ages of 2 days, 14-17 days, and 47-50 days. In 2 out of the 4 farms, no antimicrobials were used during the rearing period. In the other two farms, following collection of the fecal samples at 14 and 15 days of age, oxytetracycline (OTC), sulfadimethoxine (SDMX), and tylosin were given to birds on one farm and SDMX was used in the other. Isolates resistant to ampicillin and OTC that were obtained from an untreated flock at different sampling times were closely related to each other by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns (PFGE) of XbaI-digested chromosomal DNA. PFGE analysis together with in vitro conjugation experiments suggested that diversity of resistance phenotypes within a clone may be resulted from the acquisition and loss of R-plasmids in an untreated and a treated flock. The numbers of resistance phenotypes observed among fecal isolates increased during the growth of the chickens in all the farms. The results in the present study suggest that persistence of commensal E. coli strains resistant to antimicrobials even in the absence of antimicrobial administration. It is also hypothesized that horizontal transmission of resistance determinants resulted in the emergence of different resistance phenotypes in those farms.
