An epidemic IMP-13 metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa clone, causing infections and even large outbreaks in Italian critical care settings, was detected in a young cystic fibrosis patient. In this patient, the chronic infection was sustained by distinct clonal sub-populations of the MBL-producing P. aeruginosa clone, either susceptible or resistant to carbapenems. These findings underscore the importance of infection prevention practices in cystic fibrosis settings and pose an important diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.
