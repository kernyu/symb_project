BACKGROUND: Conventional cancer therapies are associated with severe side-effects and the development of drug resistance. Therefore, new strategies to specifically target tumor cells leaving healthy tissue unaffected are of great interest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: On this respect, we tested the antimicrobial peptide (KLAKLAK)(2). RESULTS: This peptide exhibits cytotoxicity against human breast cancer and other tumor cells, while healthy cells remain unaffected. Moreover, treatment with this cationic amphipathic peptide results in slower tumor growth and longer overall survival in vivo. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest a potential use of (KLAKLAK)(2) peptide for patients with breast and other types of cancer.
