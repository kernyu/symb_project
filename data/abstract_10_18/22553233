We report an atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli O127a:K63 strain with resistance to quinolones and extended-spectrum cephalosporins isolated from a 2010 food poisoning outbreak involving 112 adults in China. Two resistance genes [bla(CTX-M-15), aac(6')-Ib-c] and five mutations (two in gyrA, two in parC, one in parE) coexisted in this enteropathogenic E. coli strain.
