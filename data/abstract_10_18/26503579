Species of Amycolatopsis, well recognized as producers of both vancomycin and rifamycin, are also known for producing other secondary metabolites, with wide usage in medicine and agriculture. The molecular genetics of natural antibiotics produced by this genus have been well studied. Since the rise of antibiotic resistance, finding new drugs to fight infection has become an urgent priority. Progress in understanding the biosynthesis of metabolites greatly helps the rational manipulation of biosynthetic pathways, and thus to achieve the goal of generating novel natural antibiotics. The efforts made in exploiting Amycolatopsis genome sequences for the discovery of novel natural products and biosynthetic pathways are summarized.
