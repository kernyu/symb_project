We examined regional surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility of community acquired bacterial pathogens from patients in Saitama, Japan. The fourth-year survey was conducted in three of the period 2007-2010 (period I, 2007-2008; period II, 2008-2009; period III, 2009-2010). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted at the central reference laboratory according to the method recommended by Japanese Society of Chemotherapy using maximum 13 antibacterial agents. Susceptibility testing was evaluable with 789 strains (227 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 148 Streptococcus pyogenes, 220 Haemophilus influenzae, and 194 Moraxella catarrhalis). Ratio of penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PSSP, MIC of benzylpenicillin </= 0.06 mug/mL) was 43.5% (period I), 43.5% (period II) and 55.8% (period III), and those of erythromycin-sensitive and azithromycin-sensitive S. pyogenes were 100% and 65.5% (period I), 47.9% and 47.9% (period II), 29.4%, and 29.4% (period III) , respectively. Among H. influenzae, beta-lactamase-nonproducing ampicillin-resistant isolates were 34.9% (period I), 25.8% (period II), and 17.1% (period III); however, beta-lactamase-nonproducing ampicillin-intermediately resistant isolates were 19.8% (period I), 26.9% (period II), and 29.3% (period III). Regarding M. catarrhalis, macrolides showed potent activities, with MIC90s of </= 0.25-0.5 mug/mL, and fluoroquinolones showed strong activities, with MIC90s </=0.03-0.125 mug/mL. The result of this survey indicated that the trends observed were similar to the results of previous nationwide surveillance.
