Treatment of pancreatic cancer with gemcitabine (GEM) is limited due to its rapid plasma metabolism and development of chemoresistance. MicroRNA (miRNA) regulates cancer stem cell (CSC) maintenance and induces chemoresistance in cancer cells. In this study, we observed differential downregulation of miR-205 (miR-205-5p) in human pancreatic cancer tissues and cells. Compared to GEM-sensitive MIA PaCa-2 cells, miR-205 was highly downregulated in GEM-resistant MIA PaCa-2R cells. Lentivirus-mediated overexpression of miR-205 inhibits MIA PaCa-2R cell proliferation after GEM-treatment. Further investigation confirmed that miR-205 alone significantly reduces the proliferation of CSCs and tumor growth in mouse models. However, miR-205 in combination with GEM was more efficient in reducing the proliferation of CSCs and 3D spheroids. Moreover, miR-205 overexpressing MIA PaCa-2R cells induced orthotopic tumor growth was significantly inhibited after intravenous administration of GEM-conjugated methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(2-methyl-2-carboxyl-propylene carbonate)-graft-gemcitabine-graft-dodecanol (mPEG-b-PCC-g-GEM-g-DC) (mPEG-b-PCC-g-GEM-g-DC) polymeric micelles. Also, a reduction in CSCs, EMT and chemoresistance markers was observed in miR-205 overexpressing MIA PaCa-2R cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of orthotopic tumors showed a decrease in drug resistance protein caveolin-1 and cell proliferation marker Ki-67 in combination treatment. Overall, our findings suggest that miR-205 resensitizes GEM-resistant pancreatic cancer cells to GEM and acts as a tumor suppressor miRNA.
