Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) are known to have inhibitory and fungicidal effects. Resistance against fungal infection has emerged as a major health problem in recent years, which needs great and immediate concern. Here, we report the extracellular biological synthesis of silver nanoparticles through a simple green route approach using a marine mangrove (Rhizophora mucronata) and silver nitrate. Aqueous extract of marine mangrove helped in reduction and was used as capping agent in biological synthesis. Nanoparticles were characterized using microscopy and spectroscopy techniques such as HRTEM, UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy and FTIR spectroscopy. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the nanoparticles had face centered cubic structure with crystalline nature. FTIR spectroscopy showed the presence of different functional groups, such as hydroxyl and carbonyl, involved in the synthesis of nanoparticles. The antifungal activity of fluconazole and itraconazole was enhanced against the tested pathogenic fungi in the presence of Ag-NP and confirmed from increase in fold area of inhibition. This environmentally friendly method of biological synthesis can be easily integrated for various medical applications.
