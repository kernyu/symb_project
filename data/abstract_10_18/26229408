AIM: To examined the efficacy and safety of treatment with boceprevir, PEGylated-interferon and ribavirin (PR) in hepatitis C virus genotype 1 (HCVGT1) PR treatment-failures in Asia. METHODS: The Boceprevir Named-Patient Program provided boceprevir to HCVGT1 PR treatment-failures. Participating physicians were invited to contribute data from their patients: baseline characteristics, on-treatment responses, sustained virological response at week 12 (SVR12), and safety were collected and analysed. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine predictors of response. RESULTS: 150 patients were enrolled from Australia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand (Asians = 86, Caucasians = 63). Overall SVR12 was 61% (Asians = 59.3%, Caucasians = 63.5%). SVR12 was higher in relapsers (78%) compared with non-responders (34%). On-treatment responses predicted SVR, with undetectable HCVRNA at week 4, 8 and 12 leading to SVR12s of 100%, 87%, and 82% respectively, and detectable HCVRNA at week 4, 8 and 12, leading to SVR12s of 58%, 22% and 6% respectively. Asian patients were similar to Caucasian patients with regards to on-treatment responses. Patients with cirrhosis (n = 69) also behaved in the same manner with regards to on-treatment responses. Those with the IL28B CC genotype (80%) had higher SVRs than those with the CT/TT (56%) genotype (P = 0.010). Multivariate analysis showed that TW8 and TW12 responses were independent predictors of SVR. Serious adverse events occurred in 18.6%: sepsis (2%), decompensation (2.7%) and blood transfusion (14%). Discontinuations occurred in 30.7%, with 18.6% fulfilling stopping rules. CONCLUSION: Boceprevir can be used successfully in PR treatment failures with a SVR12 > 80% if they have good on-treatment responses; however, discontinuations occurred in 30% because of virological failure or adverse events.
