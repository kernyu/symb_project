BACKGROUND: Quinolone antibiotics have been widely used to treat diarrheal diseases caused by the bacterial agents such as those belonging to Vibrio spp. and Shigella spp. As these pathogens are accumulating quinolone resistance, treating the infections caused by them has become complicated. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, isolates of Vibrio and Shigella species, obtained from the diarrhea patients from Kolkata, India were analyzed for quinolone resistance. In total, nine V. cholerae, eleven V. fluvialis, seven V. parahaemolyticus and ten Shigella isolates (7S. flexneri, 2S. dysenteriae and 1S. sonnei) that showed reduced susceptibility to quinolones were studied to unravel the genetic factors responsible for quinolone resistance. The antimicrobial susceptibility assays showed a wide-spectrum and varying degree of resistance to different generations of quinolones. Genotypic characterization revealed the involvement of GyrA(S83I) and ParC(S85L) mutations in V. cholerae and V. fluvialis isolates whereas Shigella isolates showed mutations S83L and/or D87N/Y in GyrA and S80I or E84K in ParC. Analysis of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes showed that qnrVC5 was detected in three V. fluvialis isolates, aac(6')-Ib-cr was detected in one V. fluvialis isolate, and the qnrS1 was detected in a S. flexneri isolate. CONCLUSIONS: These results emphasized that quinolone resistance was widespread and therefore quinolones should be used prudentially. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study where resistance to various generations of quinolones in Vibrio spp. as well as Shigella spp. over a period of 12 years has been dissected in terms of detailed genotype-phenotype correlation.
