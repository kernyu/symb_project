Campylobacter isolates (n = 297; 202 C. jejuni and 95 C. coli isolates) recovered from 2,513 retail meat samples (chicken breasts, ground turkey, ground beef, and pork chops) were examined for antimicrobial susceptibility. The isolates were further analyzed for genetic relatedness by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using SmaI and KpnI restriction enzymes, and a subset of isolates (n = 174) were subtyped by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The resistance most frequently observed was that to doxycycline (27.6%), followed by ciprofloxacin (13.8%) and erythromycin (6.4%). All isolates were susceptible to gentamicin and meropenem. C. coli showed higher resistance to doxycycline than did C. jejuni (42.1 versus 20.8%) and lower resistance to ciprofloxacin than did C. jejuni (10.5 versus 15.3%). Erythromycin resistance was only observed in C. coli. PFGE using SmaI plus KpnI digestion generated 168 clusters from 297 isolates: 115 from C. jejuni and 53 from C. coli. MLST revealed 44 sequence types (STs) under 10 clonal complexes from 120 C. jejuni and 27 STs under two clonal complexes from 54 C. coli. There was a positive association between PFGE and STs; however, PFGE showed greater discriminatory power than MLST. Subtyping data did not correlate with antimicrobial resistance phenotypes.
