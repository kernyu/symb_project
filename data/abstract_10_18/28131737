Trichomonas vaginalis cases refractory to metronidazole (MTZ) treatment had been reported. This study aimed to the assessment of in vitro metronidazole resistance among Trichomonas positive cases with treatment failure by determination of metronidazole minimal lethal concentration (MLC), and to the evaluation of the in vitro efficacy of nitazoxanide (NTZ) as compared to metronidazole (MTZ) in both resistant and susceptible isolates. Drug testing was carried out by an aerobic tube assay where suspension of Trichomonas trophozoites was exposed for 24 and 48 h to serial dilution of metronidazole and nitazoxanide. In refractory isolates n = 30, median MLC conc. for MTZ was 100 mug/ml versus 50 mug/ml for NTZ (P < .0001). After 48 h median MLC conc. for MTZ was 25 mug/ml versus 12 mug/ml for NTZ (P < .0001). NTZ against resistant isolates was twice as active as MTZ at 24 h and increased to 2.5 times at 48 h while in susceptible isolates, NTZ was twice as active as MTZ at both 24 h and 48 h. MTZ was about 8 times more active in susceptible than in resistant isolates. So, high doses of metronidazole in resistant cases will likely increase side effects. The study proved the activity of NTZ against trichomoniasis especially in cases with MTZ resistance.
