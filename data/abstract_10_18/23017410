Penicillium spp. are among the major postharvest pathogens of citrus fruit. Induction of natural resistance in fruits constitutes one of the alternatives to chemical fungicides. Here, we investigated the involvement of the phenylpropanoid pathway in the induction of resistance in Navelate oranges by examining changes in the metabolic profile of upon eliciting citrus fruits. By using both HPLC-PDA-FD and HPLC-PDA-QTOF-MS allowed the identification of several compounds that seem to be relevant for induced resistance. In elicited fruits, a greater diversity of phenolic compounds was observed in the flavedo (outer coloured part of the peel) when compared to the albedo (inner white part). Moreover, only small changes were detected in the most abundant citrus flavonoids. The coumarin scoparone was among the compounds with the highest induction upon elicitation. Two other highly induced compounds were identified as citrusnin A and drupanin aldehyde. All three compounds are known to exert antimicrobial activity. Our results suggest that phenylpropanoids and their derivatives play an important role in the induction of resistance in citrus fruit.
