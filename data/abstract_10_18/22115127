A strain of Escherichia coli was positive for 5 aminoglycoside modifying enzyme genes (aac(3)-I, aac(6')-Ib-cr, ant(3'''')-I, aadA5, and aph(3')-I) in PCR assays. And these positive genes confer resistance to aminoglycosides (gentamicin and tobramycin). This is the first report of emergence of five kinds of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes genes simultaneously in E. coli worldwide.
