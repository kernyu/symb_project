A new eremophilane sesquiterpene, sporogen AO-2 (1), and a new beyerane diterpene, thecacorin C (2), together with two known compounds, longifoamide-B (3) and methylcholestane-3beta,5alpha,6beta-triol (4), were isolated from the stems of Manihot esculenta. The structures of the two new compounds were determined by spectroscopic techniques (UV, IR, MS, 1D, and 2D NMR). Antimicrobial assay showed that compound 3 possessed modest inhibitory effects on Saphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S.aureus, diameters of inhibition zones of which were 7.5 and 8.0 mm, respectively. Compound 4 possessed modest inhibitory effect on S. aureus, the diameter of inhibition zone of which was 6.8 mm.
