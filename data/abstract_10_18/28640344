The constant use of chemical insecticides for Aedes aegypti control has caused resistance in the mosquito populations. Thus, the objective of this study was to analyze the larvicidal potential of extracts and fractions of plants on A. aegypti larvae. The analysis included sixty one extracts and twenty five fractions of fifty botanical species at concentrations of 0.25; 0.12; 0.06 to 0.03 mg mL-1; 4 replications and one negative control of dechlorinate water and 1% DMSO; and a positive control with rotenone. The toxicity index in descending order with LC50 for the most active of the extracts selected were ethanol extract of Ormosea arborea (0.111 mg mL-1) seeds and ethanol extracts of leaves such as Piper hispidum (0.169 mg mL-1), Solanum variabile (0.188 mg mL-1), O. arborea (0.238 mg mL-1), Turnera umifolia (0.242 mg mL-1) and Piper hispidum (0.567 mg mL-1). For plant fractions, the most active were chloroform (0.192 mg mL-1) and hexane (0.342 mg mL-1) P. aduncum leaves, hexane fraction (0.415 mg mL-1) and methanol extract (0.625 mg mL-1) of Spermacocea latifolia leaves. Regarding the extract of T. umifolia single species, there is no bibliographic report on their degree of efficiency as an insecticide.
