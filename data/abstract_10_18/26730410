The importance of nosocomial infections caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci is constantly growing. The threat primarily affects immunocompromised patients, the elderly and neonates, particularly after invasive surgery. The problem is fundamentally exacerbated by expanding antibacterial drug resistance. A case report is presented of an 86-year-old patient who underwent a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery and developed septicaemia upon surgical wound infection. The causal agent was likely a carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, however, daptomycin-resistant Staphylococcus pettenkoferi was identified in blood cultures in the absence of daptomycin treatment. To the authors' knowledge, the case study presented is the first published episode of daptomycin-resistant S. pettenkoferi strain.
