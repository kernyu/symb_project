Common vetch (Vicia sativa L.) is a legume species with an extensive agricultural use. However, the phytoremediation potentiality of this species has not been sufficiently explored because little is known about its resistance to inorganic and organic pollutants. In the present work, phenol tolerance of common vetch was assayed at different stages of growth. Germination index and germination rate decreased only at high phenol concentrations (250 and 500 mg L(-1)), whereas 30-day-old plants were able to tolerate this pollutant, with high removal efficiencies. The activities of antioxidative enzymes, such as peroxidase (POD) and ascorbate peroxidase, increased significantly with the highest phenol concentration, whereas superoxide dismutase activity, malondialdehyde, and H(2)O(2) levels remained unaltered. Besides, an increase in two basic isoforms of POD was observed in plants treated with phenol. The results suggested that common vetch has an efficient protection mechanism against phenol-induced oxidative damage. Moreover, it could tolerate and remove high phenol concentrations, avoiding serious phytotoxic effects. Thus, V. sativa could be considered an interesting tool in the field of phytoremediation.
