Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) aims to optimise treatment, minimise the risk of adverse effects and reduce health care costs. In addition, it is recognised as a key component to stop the current spread of antimicrobial resistance in Europe. Educational programmes are particularly important for the successful implementation of AMS. Training should start during medical school, continue during clinical training and be reinforced throughout postgraduate training. National core curricula for paediatric training should include passive and active training of competencies needed for AMS and future paediatricians should be skilled in taking leadership roles in AMS initiatives. Other core members of the paediatric AMS team should also receive training focused on the unique medical needs of the paediatric patient. CONCLUSION: Ideally, all communities, hospitals and health regions in Europe should have AMS that serve all patient types, including children. We all have the responsibility to ensure that existing antibiotics remain effective. What is Known: * Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) is a key component to stop the current spread of antimicrobial resistance * Educational programmes are particularly important for the successful implementation of AMS What is New: * All medical doctors in Europe who will be undertaking significant practice in child health should master the competencies needed to prescribe antibiotics to children rationally as described in the European Academy of Paediatrics (EAP) Curriculum for Common Trunk Training in Paediatrics * Interdisciplinary approaches of education need to be developed, as all hospitals and health regions in Europe ideally should have AMS programmes that serve all patient types, including children.
