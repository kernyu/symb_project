BACKGROUND: It is a documented fact that upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is more of a viral illness. OBJECTIVES: This study aims at documenting the prevalence of the use of unprescribed antibiotics in children aged <5 years with upper respiratory symptomatology. METHODS: Four hundred twenty-three mother-child pairs were enrolled for this study. Chi-square and logistic regression analysis were used to find association between use of unprescribed antibiotics and variables of interest. RESULTS: The prevalence of unprescribed antibiotics in children aged <5 years in the management of URTI is 75.9%. The antibiotics abuse was commoner in older children with URTI (45.9% in children aged 12-24 months) and among mothers with higher educational attainment. CONCLUSION: Antibiotics abuse among mothers is high. Government, through its responsible agencies, should enforce stricter control or outrightly stop sale of antibiotics over-the-counter to prevent the dreaded antibiotics resistance.
