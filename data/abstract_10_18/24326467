Praziquantel is currently the only drug of choice for the treatment of human Schistosoma japonicum infections, and praziquantel-based chemotherapy has been proved to be generally effective to control the morbidity and reduce the prevalence and intensity of S. japonicum infections. However, the potential emergence of praziquantel resistance in S. japonicum seriously threatens the elimination of this neglected tropical disease in China. The purpose of this study was designed, in mouse animals, to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of artemether and artesunate against praziquantel non-susceptible S. japonicum. Mice infected with a praziquantel non-susceptible isolate and a praziquantel-susceptible isolate of S. japonicum were treated with artemether and artesunate at a single oral dose of 300 mg/kg given once on each of days 7-8 and 35-36 post-infection to assess the efficacy against juvenile and adult worms. Administration with artemether and artesunate at a single oral dose of 300 mg/kg on each of days 7-8 post-infection resulted in total worm burden reductions of 72.8 and 73.5% in mice infected with praziquantel-susceptible S. japonicum, and 77.9 and 74.1% in mice infected with the non-susceptible isolate (both P values >0.05), while the same treatments given on days 35-36 post-infection reduced total worm burdens by 71.4 and 69.6% in mice infected with the susceptible isolate, and 75.3 and 69.6% in mice infected with the non-susceptible parasite (both P values >0.05). It is concluded that there is no evidence for reduced susceptibility of artemether and artesunate in praziquantel non-susceptible S. japonicum.
