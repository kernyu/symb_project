Amoxicillin, used to manage bacterial infection, is among the top five popular pharmaceuticals in the United States, based on the number of prescriptions. Problems with environmentally available drugs can arise chiefly; biological resistance in excess amounts becomes available in wastewater samples. Previously, we observed that Amoxicillin could be removed quantitatively from deionized water by passage over Octolig(R), a polythylenediimine covalently attached to high-surface-area silica gel. This study was concerned with testing the potential removal of Amoxicillin in different solutions (tap water, well water, river water, and the weakly saline water). These solutions were passed over chromatography columns at a rate of 10 mL per minute; 50-mL fractions were collected and analyzed for total dissolved solids and pH as well as concentration. As noted in our previous work, the percentage removal was related to the length of the column, and this aspect was evaluated again. Consistent results were obtained for DI water, tap water, well water, and river water, indicating quantitative removal, and but not artificial bay water, presumably because of ion competition.
