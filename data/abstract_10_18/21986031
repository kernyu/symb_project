Rapid and reliable detection of carbapenem-resistant bacteria is an important infection-control measure and a crucial aspect of antimicrobial chemotherapy. IMP-type metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) is an emzyme that mediate carbapenem resistance in bacteria. Here, an immunochromatographic assay was newly developed using novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) recognizing IMP-type MBL. Epitope mapping of mAbs and mutational analysis of the epitope region in IMP antigen suggested that the mAbs could react to all known subtypes of IMP-type MBL. Evaluation of the assay using Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains (n=248) showed that the results of the immunochromatographic detection of the IMP-type MBLs were fully consistent with those of the PCR analysis for bla(IMP) genes, showing false positives and negatives. All positive strains were resistant to carbapenem (MIC >/= 16 mug/ml). The assay also accurately distinguished the production of IMP-type MBLs in Pseudomonas putida, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. The detection limit of the assay was 5.7x10(4)cfu per test. Taken together, these data suggest that the developed assay can be used for rapid and reliable diagnosis of the production of IMP-type MBLs in Gram-negative bacteria.
