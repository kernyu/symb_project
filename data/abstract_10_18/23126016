The paper deals with dependence of survival of Crt(+)- and Crt- mutants of Streptomyces globisporus 1912 in conditions of oxidizing stress caused by hydrogen peroxide on the level of lycopene and beta-carotene biosynthesis. Pink mutants 4Lcp, RVLcp and R3Lcp, which produce lycopene, are the most resistant to hydrogen peroxide. Red mutants 4Crt, 6Crt, 7Crt, 7Y RVCrt, R3Crt--producers of lycopene and beta-carotene have the average level of resistance to H2O2. Pigmentless mutants (Crt-) 4W, 4W1, 7W2 and yellow one 7Y have preserved sensitivity to H2O2 characteristic of the initial strain 1912.
