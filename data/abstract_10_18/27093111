Emergence of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp., especially Acinetobacter baumannii, in hospitals has been increasingly detected worldwide. In the present study, we analyzed carbapenem-resistant isolates (70 A. baumannii and one Acinetobacter pittii) collected in a period of 4 years (February 2008 to January 2012) in one diagnostic laboratory in Germany. All isolates were carbapenemase positive with OXA-23 as by far the most common enzyme (n = 66, 93%). Carbapenemases OXA-24-like and OXA-58 were not present in the isolates, but genes blaGIM-1 and ISAba1+blaOXA-80/82 were found to be the cause of carbapenem resistance in one and four isolates, respectively. Polymerase chain reaction typing revealed that the majority of A. baumannii isolates could be assigned to the very successful international clone 2. ApaI-macrorestriction and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) indicated clonal transmission of resistant strains (eight different PFGE types) within several hospitals. By multilocus sequence typing, the isolates were to be assigned to ST195 (n = 44), ST236 (n = 12), ST208 (n = 4), ST437 (n = 3), ST231 (n = 3), ST448 (n = 2), ST556 (n = 1), and ST945 (n = 1). The wide spread of carbapenem-resistant clones of A. baumannii is facilitated by international travelling and needs continuous surveillance in hospitals and diagnostic laboratories.
