We report the observation of a necrotizing pneumonia due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus harboring the Panton-Valentine leukocidin-encoding gene in a previously healthy neonate, with favorable clinical outcome in spite of extensive radiologic lesions. The case was linked to a cluster of 3 neonates colonized by Panton-Valentine leukocidin-producing, methicillin-resistant S. aureus through cross-transmission in the nursery, underlining the need to comply with standard infection control precautions in the maternity ward.
