INTRODUCTION: Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli, a species that is a leading cause of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and is a major global public health concern. This study was designed to detect the differences in antibiotic resistance patterns, the production and type of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), and the clonal relationships among E. coli isolates from UTIs and fecal samples. METHODS: Antibacterial resistance was determined by the disk diffusion method. ESBL, carbapenemase, and AmpC-producing isolates were detected phenotypically. Then, the ESBL genes were sequenced to detect the type. Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-polymerase chain reaction (ERIC-PCR) was performed on the ESBL-positive isolates. RESULTS: The most common effective antibacterial agents were colistin, imipenem, and amikacin. Among the isolates, 204 (56.6%) were MDR. Of the 163 ESBL-positive isolates, 11 (6.7%) produced AmpC, and the frequencies of beta-lactamase-positive genes were as follows: bla CTX-Mgroup1, 76%; bla TEM1, 74.8%; bla SHV12, 1.2%; and bla OXA1, 12.88%. ERIC PCR showed a diverse pattern, suggesting that clonal spread of E. coli in this area is uncommon, and that most of the infecting strains are endogenous. CONCLUSIONS: The high rates of antibacterial-resistant and MDR isolates are quite important since these strains can act as source of resistant bacteria that can be spread in the community. Controlling antibiotic use, against inappropriate use and abuse, in the community and continuous surveillance of emerging resistance traits are critical to controlling the spread of resistance.
