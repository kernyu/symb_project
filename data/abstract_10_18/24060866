The opportunistic human pathogen Enterococcus faecium overproduces the low-affinity PBP5. In clinical strains, mutations in PBP5 further reduce its acylation rate by beta-lactams. Previous studies have reported that ceftaroline had poor inhibitory activity against beta-lactam-resistant E. faecium strains. In this study, we show that ceftaroline exhibits killing activity against our laboratory-derived ampicillin-resistant E. faecium mutant that overproduces a wild-type PBP5 and that ceftaroline inactivates PBP5 much faster than benzylpenicillin and faster than ceftobiprole.
