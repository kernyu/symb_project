Isoliquiritigenin (ISL) and liquiritigenin (LTG) are structurally related flavonoids found in a variety of plants. Discovery of novel antimicrobial combinations for combating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections is of vital importance in the post-antibiotic era. The present study was taken to explore the in vitro and in vivo combination effect of LTG and ISL with beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillin, ampicillin and oxacillin) against mec A-containing strains of MRSA. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of both LTG and ISL exhibited significant anti-MRSA activity (50-100 microg/mL) against clinical isolates of MRSA. The result of in vitro combination study showed that ISL significantly reduced MIC of beta-lactam antibiotics up to 16-folds [ summation operator fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) 0.312-0.5], while LTG reduced up to 8-folds ( summation operatorFIC 0.372-0.5). Time kill kinetics at graded MIC combinations (ISL/LTG + beta-lactam) indicated 3.27-9.79-fold and 2.59-3.48-fold reduction in the growth of clinical isolates of S. aureus respectively. In S. aureus-infected Swiss albino mice model, combination of ISL with oxacillin significantly (p < 0.05, p < 0.01, p < 0.001) lowered the systemic microbial burden in blood, liver, kidney, lung and spleen tissues in comparison with ISL, oxacillin alone as well as untreated control. Considering its synergistic antibacterial effect, we suggest both ISL and LTG as promising compounds for the development of novel antistaphylococcal combinations.
