Species belonging to the Aerococcus genus are isolated from the urine and blood of elderly patients suffering from urinary tract infections (UTIs). However, the clinical significance, phenotypic features and antimicrobial susceptibilities of these underestimated and/or misidentified species remain unclear. From March 2006 to November 2008, among 350 non-enterococcal Streptococcaceae species isolated from urinary specimens, 30 (8.6%) Aerococcus spp. strains were recovered. All strains were characterized using a phenotypic approach (API 20 STREP, ID 32 STREP and VITEK 2 systems), 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and susceptibility to antimicrobial agents commonly used in UTIs. The average age of patients was 73 y and most of them presented with a predisposing urological disease (31%) and/or a systemic underlying condition (48%). All isolates were identified to the species level using the molecular tool (Aerococcus urinae, n = 20; Aerococcus sanguinicola, n = 8; Aerococcus viridans, n = 2), whereas the phenotypic methods were frequently unreliable. All aerococcal isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin and showed a low-level resistance to gentamicin. Fluoroquinolones, co-trimoxazole, and fosfomycin exhibited a variable activity. Most A. urinae isolates were resistant to co-trimoxazole and susceptible to fosfomycin, whereas all A. sanguinicola isolates were resistant to fosfomycin and susceptible to co-trimoxazole.
