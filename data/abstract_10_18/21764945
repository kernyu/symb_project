Sulfonamide-trimethoprim-resistant Aeromonas salmonicida and motile Aeromonas spp. from diseased fish of the GERM-Vet study carried the sul1 gene together with mostly cassette-borne trimethoprim resistance genes, including the novel gene dfrA28. The seven dfrA and dfrB genes identified were located mostly in class 1 integrons which commonly harbored other gene cassettes.
