Highly drug-resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Indiana became the most common serovar in broilers with diarrhea in China over the course of this study (15% in 2010 to 70% in 2014). While most S. Indiana isolates (87%, 384/440) were resistant to 13 to 16 of the 16 antibiotics tested, 89% of non-S. Indiana isolates (528/595) were resistant to 0 to 6 antibiotics. Class 1 integrons and IncHI2-type plasmids were detected in all S. Indiana isolates, but only in 39% and 1% of non-S. Indiana isolates.
