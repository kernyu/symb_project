We describe a case of urethritis in a young man caused by Corynebacterium glucuronolyticum. This bacterium is a synonym of Corynebacterium seminale, a known agent of non-gonococcal urethritis, that cannot be regarded as commensal flora in the urogenital region when is isolated in a symptomatic clinical context. Accuracy in diagnosis and correct treatment is important for avoiding probable complications, for example prostatitis. Bacterial isolation is convenient, and an antimicrobial susceptibility test should be conducted to discover antimicrobial resistance. In our case the patient was successfully treated with fluoroquinolones and was symptom-free in 2 weeks.
