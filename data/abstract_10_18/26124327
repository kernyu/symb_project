BACKGROUND: Pancreatic carcinoma (PC) is among the most lethal types of carcinomas worldwide. We aimed to establish well-defined PC cell lines in order to determine their resistance to chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cells cultured from the tumors of two patients were analyzed for xenograft formation, V-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) and TP53 mutations, chemosensitivity, and mRNAs encoding rate-limiting enzymes that metabolize anticancer drugs. RESULTS: The TYPK-1 and TYPK-2 cell lines were established from the lymph node of a locally advanced PC and from the ascites of a multi-metastatic and multi-chemoresistant PC, respectively. Each cell line generated tumors in nude mice. KRAS and TP53 mutations were detected in TYPK-1 but not TYPK-2 cells. TYPK-1 cells were resistant to gemcitabine, and TYPK-2 cells were resistant to oxaliplatin. The gemcitabine sensitivity of each cell line correlated with the expression of mRNAs encoding DCK and SLCAC29A1. CONCLUSION: TYPK-1 and TYPK-2 cells may contribute to investigations of resistance to anticancer drugs.
