Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a highly lethal malignancy that often becomes resistant to chemotherapy. The effect of silencing the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis gene (XIAP) on resistance to cisplatin, paclitaxel and gemcitabine was studied in the NSCLC cell lines A549 and H460. Transfection of these cells with small interfering RNA (siRNA) for XIAP blocked overexpression of the gene, suppressed cell proliferation, increased apoptosis and increased the cells' sensitivity to cisplatin and paclitaxel by preventing the binding of XIAP to caspase3 and increasing the activity of this enzyme. There was no significant difference in resistance to gemcitabine between XIAP-silenced cells and non-transfected cells. Changes in chemoresistance were independent of the activity of caspase-9. Silencing XIAP with siRNA can decrease chemoresistance in NSCLC and may have a potential role in the treatment of this disease.
