AIMS: To select and evaluate an appropriate outer membrane (OM) permeabilizer to use in combination with the highly muralytic bacteriophage endolysin EL188 to inactivate (multi-resistant) Pseudomonas aeruginosa. METHODS AND RESULTS: We tested the combination of endolysin EL188 and several OM permeabilizing compounds on three selected Ps. aeruginosa strains with varying antibiotic resistance. We analysed OM permeabilization using the hydrophobic probe N-phenylnaphtylamine and a recombinant fusion protein of a peptidoglycan binding domain and green fluorescent protein on the one hand and cell lysis assays on the other hand. Antibacterial assays showed that incubation of 10(6) Ps. aeruginosa cells ml(-1) in presence of 10 mmol l(-1) ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid disodium salt dihydrate (EDTA) and 50 mug ml(-1) endolysin EL188 led to a strain-dependent inactivation between 3.01 +/- 0.17 and 4.27 +/- 0.11 log units in 30 min. Increasing the EL188 concentration to 250 mug ml(-1) further increased the inactivation of the most antibiotic resistant strain Br667 (4.07 +/- 0.09 log units). CONCLUSIONS: Ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid disodium salt dihydrate was selected as the most suitable component to combine with EL188 in order to reduce Ps. aeruginosa with up to 4 log units in a time interval of 30 min. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This in vitro study demonstrates that the application range of bacteriophage encoded endolysins as 'enzybiotics' must not be limited to gram-positive pathogens.
