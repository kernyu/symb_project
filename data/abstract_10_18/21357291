Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus with a MIC of linezolid of 4 mug/ml, isolated from a patient who had undergone unsuccessful linezolid therapy, yielded linezolid-resistant mutants in blood agar at 48 h of incubation. The resistant clones showed a MIC of linezolid ranging from 8 to 64 mug/ml and accumulated the T2500A mutation(s) of the rRNA genes. Emergence of these resistant clones appears to be facilitated by a cryptic mutation or mutations associated with chloramphenicol resistance.
