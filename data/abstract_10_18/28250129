In this study, we report that gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) treatment, but not IFN-alpha, -beta, or -lambda treatment, dramatically decreased infection of human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) pseudovirus (PsV). In a survey of 20 additional HPV and animal papillomavirus types, we found that many, but not all, PsV types were also inhibited by IFN-gamma. Microscopic and biochemical analyses of HPV16 PsV determined that the antiviral effect was exerted at the level of endosomal processing of the incoming capsid and depended on the JAK2/STAT1 pathway. In contrast to infection in the absence of IFN-gamma, where L1 proteolytic products are produced during endosomal capsid processing and L2/DNA complexes segregate from L1 in the late endosome and travel to the nucleus, IFN-gamma treatment led to decreased L1 proteolysis and retention of L2 and the viral genome in the late endosome/lysosome. PsV sensitivity or resistance to IFN-gamma treatment was mapped to the L2 protein, as determined with infectious hybrid PsV, in which the L1 protein was derived from an IFN-gamma-sensitive HPV type and the L2 protein from an IFN-gamma-insensitive type or vice versa.IMPORTANCE A subset of HPV are the causative agents of many human cancers, most notably cervical cancer. This work describes the inhibition of infection of multiple HPV types, including oncogenic types, by treatment with IFN-gamma, an antiviral cytokine that is released from stimulated immune cells. Exposure of cells to IFN-gamma has been shown to trigger the expression of proteins with broad antiviral effector functions, most of which act to prevent viral transcription or translation. Interestingly, in this study, we show that infection is blocked at the early step of virus entry into the host cell by retention of the minor capsid protein, L2, and the viral genome instead of trafficking into the nucleus. Thus, a novel antiviral mechanism for IFN-gamma has been revealed.
