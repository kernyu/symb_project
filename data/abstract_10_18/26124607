BACKGROUNDG: Root canal irrigation plays a pivotal role in endodontics. Constant increase in antibiotic resistance and side effects caused by synthetic irrigants has shifted the research toward developing herbal alternatives. The current study aims to assess the ex vivo effectiveness of an indigenously prepared herbal extract "EndoPam" and compare it with the conventional endodontic irrigants for disinfection of root canals infected with Enterococcus faecalis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: As a preliminary study of the antimicrobial efficacy of the test irrigants, an Agar diffusion study was conducted, and zone of inhibition measured. Forty extracted mandibular premolars with straight root canals were selected and standardized to 12 +/- 1 mm in length. Root canals were prepared using rotary ProTaper system until F3 instrument and were infected with the culture of E. faecalis for three weeks. Specimens were divided into four groups (n = 10). Group 1: EndoPam (. INGREDIENTS: Syzigium aromaticum, Eucalyptus globulus, Cinnamomum zeylanicum and Mentha piperita), Group 2: 2% chlorhexidine, Group 3: 5.25% Sodium hypochlorite, Group 4: Normal Saline. Irrigation was performed for each group. Samples were inoculated and incubated for 24 h at 37 degrees C for qualitative analysis qualitative analysis. RESULTS: In the preliminary Agar diffusion study, EndoPam exhibited a zone of inhibition comparable to that of sodium hypochrorite. The diameter of the inhibition zone was in the following order: 2% chlorhexidine gluconate > EndoPam > 5.25% NaOCl > Normal Saline. The qualitative assay done by culturing the bacteria after a period of 3 weeks showed no bacterial growth in any of the tested irrigants, except in normal saline. CONCLUSION: It was found that the experimental product was as effective as conventional irrigants in reducing the microbial count.
