INTRODUCTION: Despite many advances, the management of prosthetic joint infection is still a complex issue. Moreover, in recent years the problem of antimicrobial resistance has emerged as an important challenge. AREAS COVERED: We analysed recent advances in different aspects of prosthetic joint infections. The importance of biofilms needs to be considered for antibiotic selection because, when embedded in these structures, bacteria acquire resistant behaviour. Moreover, the presence of resistance mechanisms in some species of organisms increases the difficulty of management. In this sense, the growing importance of methicillin-resistant staphylococci, multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa is of increasing concern. Together with these organisms, others with constitutive resistance against most antibiotics (like Enterococcus sp., mycobacteria or fungi) represent a similar problem for selection of therapy. Research into new materials that can be used as drug carriers opens a new field for management of these infections and will likely come to the front line in the coming years. EXPERT OPINION: Individualised therapies should carefully consider the aetiology, pathogenesis and antimicrobial susceptibility. Satisfactory clinical outcome could be further fostered by enhancing the multidisciplinary approach, with better collaboration in the antibiotic selection and the surgical management.
