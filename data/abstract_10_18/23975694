To obtain amino acid-analogue-resistant mutants the wild strain A9 of Arthrospira platensis was mutated by ethylmethane sulfonate (EMS). Mutagenic effects of strain A9 by EMS were studied. The experimental results indicated that the survival rate curve of strain A9 took a typical "exponential shape" with lethal dosage of EMS being 1%. The survival of A9 strain was 13.2% when treated with 0.4% of EMS, and the resistant mutation rates to two amino acid analogues, rho-fluorophenylalanine (FPA) and L-canavanine sulphate (CS), were greatly increased with the highest rates being at 4.9 x 10(-4) and 3.24 x 10(-4), respectively. By repeated screening, two stable mutants resistant to amino acid analogues, A9f resistant to FPA and A9c resistant to CS, were obtained. Resistances of the two mutants to corresponding amino acid-analogues were both significantly increased. Compared with their parent strain A9, A9f appeared larger than A9 performance in filament diameter, spiral diameter, spiral pitch, filament length and spiral number, and A9c showed much longer length and spiral pitch than those of the initial strain. Analysis results on amino acids compositions and contents showed that both two mutants accumulated quite higher concentration of amino acids in cells. The two mutants might be excellent high amino acids producing strain. By this means two useful mutants with stable genetic makers for further genetic study of A. platensis were obtained, which laid a good foundation for further study on the transformation of A. platensis.
