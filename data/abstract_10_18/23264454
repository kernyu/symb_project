Newborns are rarely infected by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing members of the Enterobacteriaceae. In a neonatal intensive care unit, 14 newborns were infected or colonized by CTX-M-15-producing Enterobacter cloacae. All seven infected patients had underlying medical conditions, and five of them were treated successfully with meropenem, whilst one untreated patient died. Paediatric infections caused by multidrug-resistant ESBL-producing Enterobacter cloacae constitute a critical clinical and epidemiological issue.
