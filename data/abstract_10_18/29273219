Immunity is a key trait in host defence against parasites and is thus likely to be under selection during host-parasite coevolution. Broadly, the immune system consists of several lines of defence including physiological innate immunity, physical barriers such as the cuticle, avoidance behaviours and in some cases antimicrobial secretions. The defence conferring the highest fitness benefit may be situation specific and depend on the taxon and infection route of the parasite. We carried out a host-parasite coevolution experiment between the red flour beetle T. castaneum, which possesses a comprehensive immune system including the ability to secrete antimicrobial compounds into its environment, and the generalist entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana. We measured levels of external immunity (benzoquinone secretion) and an internal immune trait, phenoloxidase (PO) activity throughout and in F2 to beetles at the end of the experiment. Survival (a proxy for resistance) of F2 coevolved and control beetles exposed to the fungus was also measured. No change in external immunity or survival was observed as a consequence of host-parasite coevolution, however, PO responses in evolved beetles showed increased flexibility dependent on the route of infection of the parasite. This more flexible PO response appeared to result in beetle populations being better able to cope with the parasite, buffering their fitness during the course of the coevolution experiment. This represents a subtle but significant adaptation to the presence of a parasite over evolutionary time.
