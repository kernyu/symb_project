BACKGROUND: Infection following ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement remains a significant complication with an incidence of 3-27% cited in literature. Infections cause significant morbidity, and it is important that empirical antibiotic therapy for management is guided by accurate knowledge of prevailing aetiologies and local antibiotic sensitivity patterns. AIMS: To establish the incidence of shunt infections in our paediatric population, to identify the causative micro-organisms, and to determine the antibiotic resistance patterns of the responsible micro-organisms. METHODS: Retrospective data collection utilising existing databases in the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Yorkhill, between 1 January 2006 and 30 September 2013. RESULTS: Total number of shunt operations was 308 with 28 episodes of infection involving 27 patients (male = 12, female = 15). The incidence of infection was 9%. In all, 79% of the episodes involved a single pathogen with 21% being mixed pathogens. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common cause of infection (44%). Gram-positive sensitivity to flucloxacillin and gentamicin was noticeably low at 22% and 14%, respectively with 87% of coagulase-negative staphylococci resistant to gentamicin and 81% resistant to flucloxacillin. CONCLUSIONS: The changing spectrum of Gram-positive organisms has impacted on antibiotic sensitivity patterns, and our local prescribing policy has been adapted in order to manage shunt infections most effectively.
