Soil and sewage act as a reservoir of animal pathogens and their dissemination to animals profoundly affects the safety of our food supply. Moreover, acquisition and further spread of antibiotic resistance determinants among pathogenic bacterial populations is the most relevant problem for the treatment of infectious diseases. Bacterial strains from soil and sewage are a potential reservoir for antimicrobial resistance genes. Accurate species determination for anaerobes from environmental samples has become increasingly important with the re-emergence of anaerobic bacteremia and prevalence of multiple-drug-resistant microorganisms. Soil samples were collected from various locations of planar India and the diversity of anaerobic bacteria was determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Viable counts of anaerobic bacteria on anaerobic agar and SPS agar ranged from 1.0 x 10(2)cfu/g to 8.8 x 10(7)cfu/g and nil to 3.9 x 10(6)cfu/g, respectively. Among clostrdia, Clostridium bifermentans (35.9%) was the most dominant species followed by Clostridium perfringens (25.8%). Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of C. perfringens beta2 toxin gene (cpb2) fragment indicated specific phylogenetic affiliation with cluster Ia for 5 out of 6 strains. Antibiotic susceptibility for 30 antibiotics was tested for 74 isolates, revealing resistance for as high as 16-25 antibiotics for 35% of the strains tested. Understanding the diversity of the anaerobic bacteria from soil and sewage with respect to animal health and spread of zoonotic pathogen infections is crucial for improvements in animal and human health.
