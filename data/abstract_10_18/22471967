The F420 strain, isolated from raw goat milk and identified as Enterococcus hirae, was selected because of its strong activity against gram-positive bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes. Interestingly, the F420 strain lacks the virulence genes and decarboxylase activity of histidine, lysine, and ornithine, and it is susceptible to 11 of 14 tested antibiotics, including vancomycin. The antimicrobial compounds produced by E. hirae F420 strain showed high resistance to heat treatment and to acidic and basic pHs. The MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis coupled with the sequence of peptide and structural gene analysis of one of the purified enterocins showed 100% identity with enterocin P (EntP), previously described in E. faecium strains. The structural gene for EntP is located on a plasmid of 65 kb. Other enterocins with molecular mass higher than 7 kDa were also detected. This is the first report of the production of EntP by E. hirae species naturally occurring in foods. The biotechnological characteristics of the F420 strain and its enterocins indicate their potential for application in the control of L. monocytogenes and other undesirable bacteria in food systems.
