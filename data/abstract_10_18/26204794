Capnocytophaga spp. are commensal bacteria involved in oral and systemic diseases, with a variable susceptibility to beta-lactams. The cfxA gene expression level was assessed using quantitative RT-PCR, and reasons of the observed misexpression were discussed, as insertion of foreign genetic material, contributing to dissemination and evolution of antibiotic resistance genes.
