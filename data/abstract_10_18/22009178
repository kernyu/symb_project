The alpha-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha) is a key translation regulator that plays an important role in cellular stress responses. In the present study, we investigated how eIF2alpha phosphorylation can be regulated by a tumor suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) and how such regulation is used by PTEN-deficient hepatocytes to adapt and cope with oxidative stress. We found that eIF2alpha was hyperphosphorylated when Pten was deleted, and this process was AKT dependent. Consistent with this finding, we found that the Pten-null cells developed resistance to oxidative glutamate and H(2)O(2)-induced cellular toxicity. We showed that the messenger level of CReP (constitutive repressor of eIF2alpha phosphorylation), a constitutive phosphatase of eIF2alpha, was downregulated in Pten-null hepatocytes, providing a possible mechanism through which PTEN/AKT pathway regulates eIF2alpha phosphorylation. Ectopic expression of CReP restored the sensitivity of the Pten mutant hepatocytes to oxidative stress, confirming the functional significance of the downregulated CReP and upregulated phospho-eIF2alpha in the resistance of Pten mutant hepatocytes to cellular stress. In summary, our study suggested a novel role of PTEN in regulating stress response through modulating the CReP/eIF2alpha pathway.
