The emergence of multidrug-resistant-bacteria (MDRB) infection poses a major burden to modern healthcare. Early detection in the bloodstream and a new strategy development for MDRB infection treatment without antibiotics are clinically significant to save millions of lives every year. To tackle the MDRB challenge, the current manuscript reports the design of "multifunctional nanoplatforms" consisting of a magnetic core-plasmonic shell nanoparticle, a methylene blue-bound aptamer, and an MDRB Salmonella DT104 specific antibody. The reported "multifunctional nanoplatform" is capable of targeted separation from a blood sample and sensing and multimodal therapeutic killing of MDRB. Experimental data using an MDRB-infected whole-blood sample show that nanoplatforms can be used for selective magnetic separation and fluorescence imaging. In vitro light-triggered photodestruction of MDRB, using combined photodynamic and photothermal treatment, shows that the multimodal treatment regime can enhance MDRB killing significantly. We discussed the possible mechanisms on combined synergistic therapy for killing MDRB. The "multifunctional nanoplatform" reported in this manuscript has great potential for the imaging and combined therapy of MDRB in clinical settings.
