The clinical Klebsiella pneumoniae INSRA6884 strain exhibited nonsusceptibility to all penicillins tested (MICs of 64 to >2,048 mug/ml). The MICs of penicillins were weakly reduced by clavulanate (from 2,048 to 512 mug/ml), and tazobactam restored piperacillin susceptibility. Molecular characterization identified the genes bla(GES-7) and a new beta-lactamase gene, bla(SHV-107), which encoded an enzyme that differed from SHV-1 by the amino acid substitutions Leu35Gln and Thr235Ala. The SHV-107-producing Escherichia coli strain exhibited only a beta-lactam resistance phenotype with respect to amoxicillin, ticarcillin, and amoxicillin-clavulanate combination. The kinetic parameters of the purified SHV-107 enzyme revealed a high affinity for penicillins. However, catalytic efficiency for these antibiotics was lower for SHV-107 than for SHV-1. No hydrolysis was detected against oxyimino-beta-lactams. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) for clavulanic acid was 9-fold higher for SHV-107 than for SHV-1, but the inhibitory effects of tazobactam were unchanged. Molecular dynamics simulation suggested that the Thr235Ala substitution affects the accommodation of clavulanate in the binding site and therefore its inhibitory activity.
