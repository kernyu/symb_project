The potential role of parameters in the reduction of hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] by Pseudomonas aeruginosa is not well documented. In this study, laboratory batch studies were conducted to assess the effect of a variety of factors, e.g., carbon sources, salinity, initial Cr(VI) concentrations, co-existing ions and a metabolic inhibitor, on microbial Cr(VI) reduction to Cr(III) by P. aeruginosa AB93066. Strain AB93066 tolerated up to 400 mg/L of Cr(VI) in nutrient broth medium compared to only 150 mg/L of Cr(VI) in nutrient agar. This bacteria exhibited different levels of resistance against Pb(II) (200 mg/L), Cd(II) (100 mg/L), Ni(II) (100 mg/L), Cu(II) (100 mg/L), Co(II) (50 mg/L) and Hg(II) (5 mg/L). Cr(VI) reduction was significantly promoted by the addition of glucose and glycerine but was strongly inhibited by the presence of methanol and phenol. The rate of Cr(VI) reduction increased with increasing concentrations of Cr(VI) and then decreased at higher concentrations. The presence of Ni(II) stimulated Cr(VI) reduction, while Pb(II), Co(II) and Cd(II) had adverse impact on reduction ability of this strain. Cr(VI) reduction was also inhibited by high levels of NaCl, various concentrations of sodium azide and 20 mM of SO4 (2-), MoO4 (2-), NO3 (-), PO4 (3-). No significant relationship was observed between Cr(VI) reduction and redox potential of the culture medium. Scanning electron microscopy showed visible morphological changes in the cells due to chromate stress. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis revealed chromium species was likely to form complexes with certain functional groups such as carboxyl and amino groups on the surface of P. aeruginosa AB93066. Overall, above results are beneficial to the bioremediation of chromate-polluted industrial wastewaters.
