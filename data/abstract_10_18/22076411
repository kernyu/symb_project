Evaluation of epidemiological trends, risk factors, and clinical outcome associated with candidemia at a neonatal intensive care unit is reported. From January 2005 to December 2009, forty candidemia cases were identified. C. albicans and C. parapsilosis were the most common species recovered (69 and 24%, respectively). All C. parapsilosis strains were susceptible to antifungals, whereas, C. albicans exhibited higher resistance rates to azoles. Low birth weight, low gestational age, presence of central lines, endotracheal intubation, total parenteral nutrition, previous use of antibiotics, steroids, previous episode(s) of bacteremia and prolonged stay in intensive care unit were common features associated with candidemia. C. albicans was most often isolated from extremely low birth weight neonates as compared to non-albicans Candida (P < 0.01). Mortality rate was 35.7% and was associated with low gestational age (P < 0.01), low birth weight (P < 0.01), and presence of renal failure (P < 0.05). Furthermore, a critical review of recent published case series is presented.
