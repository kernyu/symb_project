Gemcitabine has been used most commonly as an anticancer drug to treat advanced pancreatic cancer patients. However, intrinsic or acquired resistance of pancreatic cancer to gemcitabine was also developed, which leads to very low five-year survival rates. Here, we investigated whether cellular levels of HSP27 phosphorylation act as a determinant of cellular fate with gemcitabine. In addition we have demonstrated whether HSP27 downregulation effectively could overcome the acquisition of gemcitabine resistance by using transcriptomic analysis. We observed that gemcitabine induced p38/HSP27 phosphorylation and caused acquired resistance. After acquisition of gemcitabine resistance, cancer cells showed higher activity of NF-kappaB. NF-kappaB activity, as well as colony formation in gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cells, was significantly decreased by HSP27 downregulation and subsequent TRAIL treatment, showing that HSP27 was a common network mediator of gemcitabine/TRAIL-induced cell death. After transcriptomic analysis, gene fluctuation after HSP27 downregulation was very similar to that of pancreatic cancer cells susceptible to gemcitabine, and then in opposite position to that of acquired gemcitabine resistance, which makes it possible to downregulate HSP27 to overcome the acquired gemcitabine resistance to function as an overall survival network inhibitor. Most importantly, we demonstrated that the ratio of phosphorylated HSP27 to nonphosphorylated HSP27 rather than the cellular level of HSP27 itself acts biphasically as a determinant of cellular fate in gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cells.
