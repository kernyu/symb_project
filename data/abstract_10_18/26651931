UNLABELLED: Multidrug resistance tuberculosis (MDR-TB) of health workers raises the question of hospital-borne transmission of infection. OBSERVATIONS: We report 4 cases of MDR-TB confirmed at the health workers over a period of 8 years (January, 2005 to December 2012), in the 2 services of pulmonology from Abidjan to Cote d'Ivoire). It was about young grown-up patients (aged between 28 and 39 years), all HIV negatives, in a no-win situation of antituberculosis treatment (3 patients/4). The most concerned staffs were the male nurses (2/4). Two agents worked in general hospital and the only one in a pulmonology department at the time of the diagnosis. The tuberculosis was of lung seat with bilateral radiographic hurt (3/4) and multiples excavations (4/4). The case index, when it was identified (2/2), was a family case. Among 3 agents who benefited from a second line treatment, 1 died further to an extensive drug resistance and 2 are declared to be cured. The fourth died before the beginning of the treatment. These cases of cure were in touch with a premature care. CONCLUSION: Multidrug resistant tuberculosis at the health workers could have a negative impact on the antituberculosis fight imposing rigorous measures of infection control and better implication of the occupational medicine.
