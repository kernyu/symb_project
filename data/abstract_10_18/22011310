The European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing-Subcommittee on Antifungal Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST-AFST) has determined breakpoints for amphotericin B for Candida spp. This Technical Note is based on the EUCAST amphotericin B rationale document (available on the EUCAST website: http://www.eucast.org). Species-specific breakpoints for C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis are S: MIC </=1 mg/L, R: MIC > 1 mg/L. There are insufficient data to set breakpoints for other species. The breakpoints are based upon pharmacokinetic data, epidemiological cut-ff values and clinical experience. Breakpoints will be reviewed regularly.
