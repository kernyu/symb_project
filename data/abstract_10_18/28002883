Tuberculosis (TB), although a curable disease, is still one of the most difficult infections to treat. Mycobacterium tuberculosis infects 10 million people worldwide and kills 1.5 million people each year. Reactivation of a latent infection is the major cause of TB. Cholesterol is a critical carbon source during latent infection. Catabolism of cholesterol contributes to the pool of propionyl-CoA, a precursor that is incorporated into lipid virulence factors. The M. tuberculosis genome contains a large regulon of cholesterol catabolic genes suggesting that the microorganism can utilize host sterol for infection and persistence. The protein products of these genes present ideal targets for rational drug discovery programmes. This review summarizes the development of enzyme inhibitors targeting the cholesterol pathway in M. tuberculosis. This knowledge is essential for the discovery of novel agents to treat M. tuberculosis infection.
