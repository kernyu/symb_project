Infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria are a serious problem and is associated with high mortality. Among them, we should highlight those caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Primary bacteremia, catheter-related bloodstream infections and constitute the main presentations. Vancomycin has traditionally been the treatment of choice for these infections, but its activity is not satisfactory especially in cases of MRSA with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) > 1 mg/L. Daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibiotic active against Gram-positive bacteria including MRSA and glycopeptide-resistant Enterococcus spp.It is worth mentioning that daptomycin is rapidly bactericidal against methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, more potent than vancomycin and at least as active as isoxazole penicillins. This article discusses the role of this antibiotic in the empirical treatment of infections and directed by Gram-positive bacteria affecting critically ill patients.
