Tigecycline is a semisynthetic analogue of earlier tetracyclines and represents the first member of a novel class of antimicrobials - glycylcyclines - recently approved for clinical use. It is active against a broad range of gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial species including clinically important multidrug-resistant nosocomial and community-acquired bacterial pathogens. The exact molecular basis of tigecycline action is not clear at present, although similarly to the tetracyclines, it has been shown to inhibit the translation elongation step by binding to the ribosome 30S subunit and preventing aminoacylated tRNAs to accommodate in the ribosomal A site. Importantly, tigecycline overcomes the action of ribosomal protection proteins and is not a substrate for tetracycline efflux pumps of most bacteria - well-known and prevalent cellular mechanisms of microbial tetracycline resistance. The present review summarizes current knowledge on the molecular mechanism of the tigecycline action, antibacterial activity against various bacteria, clinical application, development of resistance to glycylcyclines.
