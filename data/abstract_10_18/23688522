Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed on 71 Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates, and presence of antibiotic resistance genes was screened for by PCR amplification and sequencing. Resistance rates were very high for aminoglycosides (22-80%), fluoroquinolones (>90%), and cephalosporins (>90%) but remained low for rifampin (2.8%) or null for colistin. Antibiotic resistance encoding genes detected were as follows: blaTEM-128 gene (74.6%), aph(3')-VI (50.7 %), aadA (63.4%), ant(2'')-I (14.1%), aac(3)-Ia (91.1%), aac(6')-Ib (4.2%), mutation Ser83Leu in gyrA (94.4%), double mutations Ser83Leu and Ser80Leu (or Ser84Leu) in gyrA and parC (69.0%), and mutation I581N in RRDR of the rpoB gene.
