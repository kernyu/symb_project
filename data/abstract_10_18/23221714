Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is a potent innate immunity system in plants and has been used in rice fields. Development of SAR, involving priming, is achieved by activation of salicylic acid (SA)-mediated pathway. To determine whether heat shock (HS) treatment can induce SAR, we analyzed the effects of HS on Arabidopsis. HS treatment induced disease resistance, expression of SAR marker genes, and SA accumulation in wild-type but not in SA-deficient sid2 and NahG plants, indicating induction of SAR. Time course analysis of the effects of HS indicated that SAR was activated transiently, differently from biological induction, with a peak at 2-3 d after HS, and that it ceased in several days. Production of reactive oxygen species was observed before SA biosynthesis, which might be a trigger for SAR activation. The data presented here suggest that HS can induce SAR, but there exist unknown regulation mechanisms for the maintenance of SAR.
