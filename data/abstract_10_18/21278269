Bacteriocins (BCNs) are antimicrobial peptides produced by bacteria with narrow or broad spectra of antimicrobial activity. Recently, several unique anti-Campylobacter BCNs have been identified from commensal bacteria isolated from chicken intestines. These BCNs dramatically reduced C. jejuni colonization in poultry and are being directed toward on-farm control of Campylobacter. However, no information concerning prevalence, development, and mechanisms of BCN resistance in Campylobacter exists. In this study, susceptibilities of 137 C. jejuni isolates and 20 C. coli isolates to the anti-Campylobacter BCNs OR-7 and E-760 were examined. Only one C. coli strain displayed resistance to the BCNs (MIC, 64 mug/ml), while others were susceptible, with MICs ranging from 0.25 to 4 mug/ml. The C. coli mutants resistant to BCN OR-7 also were obtained by in vitro selection, but all displayed only low-level resistance to OR-7 (MIC, 8 to 16 mug/ml). The acquired BCN resistance in C. coli could be transferred at intra- and interspecies levels among Campylobacter strains by biphasic natural transformation. Genomic examination of the OR-7-resistant mutants by using DNA microarray and random transposon mutagenesis revealed that the multidrug efflux pump CmeABC contributes to both intrinsic resistance and acquired resistance to the BCNs. Altogether, this study represents the first report of and a major step forward in understanding BCN resistance in Campylobacter, which will facilitate the development of effective BCN-based strategies to reduce the Campylobacter loads in poultry.
