Infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa can be difficult to treat and require a coordinated approach for their management. This involves quickly controlling the source of infection, establishing a correct etiologic diagnosis and administering appropriate empiric antimicrobial therapy. Once antimicrobial therapy has been initiated and susceptibilities are available, therapy should be tailored with optimized antibiotic doses for an appropriate duration in order to sufficiently treat the infection and minimize resistance emergence.
