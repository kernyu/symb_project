Patients who suffer severe burns are at increased risk for local and systemic infections. The incidence of fungal infections has increased in recent years, and these infections represent a major issue in burn intensive care units. Herein, we report three cases of fungal infection due to Candida species occurring in patients undergoing supportive therapy and antibiotic treatment during their hospitalization. Two of these patients were infected with Candida parapsilosis, and one was infected with Candida albicans. The risk factors for these patients' Candida infections were multiple and prolonged courses of antimicrobial treatment, steroid treatment, tracheal intubation and smoke inhalation. Susceptibility testing of nine antifungal compounds was performed, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of all isolated strains were lower than the breakpoint MIC value for resistance of the relevant drug. All three patients were cured by treatment with antifungal agents. Candida infection may occur 1 - 3 weeks after thermal injury, and the prompt recognition and treatment of such infections with antifungal therapies may result in decreased morbidity and mortality associated with these infections in burn patients.
