Widespread bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a significant public health concern. To remain a step ahead of evolving bacteria, new methods to study resistance to antibacterials and to uncover novel antibiotics that evade resistance are urgently needed. Herein, microarray-based methods that have been developed to study aminoglycoside modification by resistance-causing enzymes are reviewed. These arrays can also be used to study the binding of aminoglycoside antibiotics to a mimic of their therapeutic target, the rRNA aminoacyl site (A-site), and how modification by resistance-causing enzymes affects their abilities to bind RNA.
