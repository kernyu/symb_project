Tripartite efflux pumps found in Gram-negative bacteria are involved in antibiotic resistance and toxic-protein secretion. In this study, we show, using site-directed mutational analyses, that the conserved residues located in the tip region of the alpha-hairpin of the membrane fusion protein (MFP) AcrA play an essential role in the action of the tripartite efflux pump AcrAB-TolC. In addition, we provide in vivo functional data showing that both the length and the amino acid sequence of the alpha-hairpin of AcrA can be flexible for the formation of a functional AcrAB-TolC pump. Genetic-complementation experiments further indicated functional interrelationships between the AcrA hairpin tip region and the TolC aperture tip region. Our findings may offer a molecular basis for understanding the multidrug resistance of pathogenic bacteria.
