Multi-drug resistant (MDR) gram-negative infections among solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients have long been associated with high morbidity and mortality. Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as a potent nosocomial pathogen with the recent acquisition of resistance to broad-spectrum beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and most notably, carbapenems. Despite a national rise in carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) infections, outcomes among SOT recipients with this emerging MDR pathogen are largely unknown. This single-center cohort is the first to describe the characteristics, complications, and outcomes among abdominal organ transplant recipients with CRAB. The current study suggests that SOT patients with CRAB suffer from prolonged hospitalization, infection with other MDR organisms, allograft dysfunction and loss, and high overall infection-related mortality.
