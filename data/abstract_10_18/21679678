A novel influenza A(H1N1)2009 variant with mildly reduced oseltamivir and zanamivir sensitivity has been detected in more than 10% of community specimens in Singapore and more than 30% of samples from northern Australia during the early months of 2011. The variant, which has also been detected in other regions of the Asia-Pacific, contains a S247N neuraminidase mutation. When combined with the H275Y mutation, as detected in an oseltamivir-treated patient, the dual S247N+H275Y mutant had extremely high oseltamivir resistance.
