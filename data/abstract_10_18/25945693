The aim of present work was to characterize the inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT) beta-lactamases produced by Escherichia coli in Hospital Clinico San Carlos (Madrid, Spain). Mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance among IRT-producing strains were also studied. Isolates with susceptibility to cephalosporins and amoxicillin-clavulanate (AMC) resistance were collected in our hospital (November 2011-July 2012) from both outpatients and hospitalized patients. Among 70 AMC-resistant E. coli strains, 28 (40%) produced IRT enzymes. Most of them were uropathogens (82.1%) and recovered from outpatients (75%). Seven different IRT enzymes were identified with TEM-30 (IRT-2) being the most prevalent, followed by TEM-40 (IRT-11). A high rate of ciprofloxacin resistance was found among IRT-producing strains (50%). Most of the ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates showed ciprofloxacin minimum inhibitory concentration >32 mg/L and contained two mutations in both gyrA and parC genes. Four IRT enzyme producers harbored the qnr gene. ST131 clone was mainly responsible for both IRT enzyme production and ciprofloxacin resistance. In conclusion, data from this study show that the frequency of IRT producers was 40% and a high rate of ciprofloxacin resistance was found among IRT-producing isolates. Current and future actions should be taken into account to avoid or reduce the development of AMC and fluoroquinolone resistance in E. coli.
