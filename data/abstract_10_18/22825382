Antibiotic resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae strains is an increasing problem in a lot of hospitals. It is a public health emergency because it relates with high mortality rate among patients in Intensive Care Unit (ICU). From 1/1/2009 to 31/08/2010, in ICU of SS Annunziata Hospital of Taranto, 140 isolated Klebsiella pneumoniae strains were detected. The strain identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were performed using a Vitek2 automated system. These isolate showed a low level of susceptibility to levofloxacin (3.4%), ciprofloxacin (6.2%), ceftazidime (2.8%) and piperacillin/tazobactam (8%). We reported also that the 10% and 13.9% of them were susceptible to meropenem and imipenem. An anti-Klebsiella pneumoniae activity in vitro to tigecycline was present in 64.6% of isolates while almost all strains (56/58) tested to colistin were susceptible. In order to our data of worryng high multiclass drug resistance including tygecicline, it needs to apply appropriate measures of surveillance and antibiotic prescription to avoid rapid spread of these mutiresistant strains in other areas.
