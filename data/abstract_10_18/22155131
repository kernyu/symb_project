The human normal microflora is relatively stable at each ecological habitat under normal circumstances and acts as a barrier against colonization by potentially pathogenic microorganisms and against overgrowth of already present opportunistic microorganisms. Administration of antimicrobial agents causes disturbances in the ecological balance between the host and the normal microflora. The risk of emergence and spread of resistant strains between patients and dissemination of resistant determinants between microorganisms is reduced if colonization resistance is not disturbed by antimicrobial agents. In this article, the potential ecological effects of administration of new antimicrobial agents on the intestinal and oropharyngeal microflora are summarized. The review is based on clinical studies published during the past 10 years.
