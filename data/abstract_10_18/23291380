BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Streptococcus pneumoniae constitutes one of the main causes of sepsis, bacteremia and meningitis (pneumococcal invasive disease - PID), and pneumonia in infants and small children. Antipneumococcal vaccination in Mexico is expected to be a useful strategy to reduce morbimortality due to this cause. We undertook this study to determine the prevalence of PID and pneumonia and the PCV vaccination status of affected children as well as serotype distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility of pneumococcal strains responsible for PID in infants and small children in Mexico. METHODS: From March 2010-June 2011, a prospective multicenter study was carried out in four states in Mexico to determine the prevalence of bacteremia, meningitis, septic arthritis and pneumonia due to S. pneumoniae and other microorganisms in children from 28 days-59 months of age. Isolated pneumococcal strains were serotyped and their antimicrobial resistance determined. RESULTS: During the study period, 545 children were diagnosed with bacteremia, meningitis, septic arthritis or pneumonia; 46.7% of these clinical entities occurred among children <12 months of age. Community-acquired pneumonia was the most prevalent disease. It was possible to identify a causal microorganism in 55 cases, from which 80% were S. pneumoniae. Fifteen percent of patients with PID died. The most prevalent pneumococcal serotypes were 19A, 35B, 19F and 6A. 10.2% of nonmeningeal strains were resistant to meropenem and 82% were resistant to TMP/SMX. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that pneumococcus was the most common bacteria isolated in the studied population, although epidemiological and laboratory-based surveillance still needs improvement.
