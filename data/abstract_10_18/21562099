Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality among both solid organ transplant (SOT) and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. Candida is the most common cause of IFI in SOT recipients and the second most common cause of IFI in HSCT recipients. We determined susceptibilities to fluconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, amphotericin B, and caspofungin for 383 invasive Candida sp. isolates from SOT and HSCT recipients enrolled in the Transplant-Associated Infection Surveillance Network and correlated these results to clinical data. Fluconazole resistance in C. albicans, C. tropicalis, and C. parapsilosis isolates was low (1%), but the high percentage of C. glabrata and C. krusei isolates within this group of patients increased the overall percentage of fluconazole resistance to 16%. Voriconazole resistance was 3% overall but was 8% among C. glabrata isolates. On multivariable analysis, among HSCT recipients fluconazole nonsusceptibility was independently associated with C. glabrata, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigenemia, diabetes active at the time of the IFI, and any prior amphotericin B use; among SOT recipients, fluconazole nonsusceptibility was independently associated with any fluconazole use in the 3 months prior to the IFI, C. glabrata, ganciclovir use in the 3 months prior to the IFI, diabetes acquired since the transplant, and gender.
