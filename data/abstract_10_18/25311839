OBJECTIVE: We wanted to describe the clinical features associated with urinalysis positive for ESBL-producing Escherichia coli and their impact on antibiotic use. METHODS: We performed a prospective observational study in 13 French hospitals of the Paris area for 3 consecutive months. We included all patients with urine cultures positive for ESBL-producing E. coli. RESULTS: One hundred and seventeen of the 218 patients (54%) presented with asymptomatic bacteriuria, 31 (14%) with cystitis, and 70 (32%) with a parenchymal infection. Nineteen patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria (16%) received antibiotics. Forty-one with parenchymal infections (59%) received a carbapenem. A carbapenem alternative could have been used in every patient treated with a carbapenem, according to antibiotic susceptibility testing results. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary tract infections accounted for 46% of E. coli ESBL positive urinalysis. Fifty percent of parenchymal infections were treated with a carbapenem.
