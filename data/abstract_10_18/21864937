We studied the risk factors associated with resistance to imipenem, levofloxacin and gentamicin in Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from blood cultures of 175 patients in a hospital in Japan. Imipenem resistance was associated with transfer from another hospital, and receiving antifungal medication. Gentamicin resistance was associated with previous administration of a penicillin. No specific risk factors were associated with levofloxacin resistance.
