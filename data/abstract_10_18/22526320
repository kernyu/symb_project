Minibacterium massiliensis strain CIP107820 is a recently discovered waterborne Gram-negative rod isolated from hospital water samples. It harbors a chromosomally located gene encoding an Ambler class A extended-spectrum beta-lactamase termed MIN-1, sharing 56%, 54%, and 51% amino acid identities with beta-lactamases LUT-1, KPC-2, and CTX-M-2, respectively. beta-Lactamase MIN-1 hydrolyzes penicillins, narrow-spectrum cephalosporins, cefotaxime, and, less efficiently, cefepime, while ceftazidime and carbapenems are very poor substrates, and cephamycins and aztreonam are not hydrolyzed.
