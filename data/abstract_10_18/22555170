OBJECTIVE: The risk of virologic failure and selection of resistant strains remains a challenge in HIV-1 perinatally infected children. HIV-1 coreceptor usage was determined in HAART-failing children followed in Necker Hospital (Paris, France) in order to estimate the proportion of these patients who may benefit from CCR5-antagonists therapy. METHODS: HIV-1 coreceptor usage was determined with the SVM(Geno2pheno10%) algorithm in 51 children with virologic failure after a median treatment exposure of 7.8 years. RESULTS: CXCR4-tropic strains were found in 31.4% of the patients. CXCR4 usage was associated with high HIV-1 DNA (P=0.01), old age (P=0.02), long ART cumulative exposure (P=0.006), and previous exposure to high number of different drugs (P=0.03) and ART combinations (P=0.03) in univariate analysis. Selection of resistant viruses and current exposure to a darunavir-based HAART tended to be more frequent in the CXCR4 group compared with the children infected with CCR5-tropic strains (P=0.06). In multivariate analysis, CXCR4 usage was exclusively correlated with HIV-1 DNA (P=0.03), which accurately reflects the cumulative exposure to viral replication over the whole duration of HIV infection. CONCLUSION: Two-thirds of HAART-failing children could benefit from CCR5 antagonists-based strategies, even in case of triple-class virologic failure. Such therapy should be discussed more appropriately at early stages of infection, when CCR5-tropic strains are most frequently isolated. However, before considering such strategies, further studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy and the tolerability of CCR5 antagonists in this pediatric population.
