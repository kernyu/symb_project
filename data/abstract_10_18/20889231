Osmopriming treatment of chilling-sensitive soybean (Glycine max L. cv. Zhonghuang-22) seeds for 72h at 25 degrees C with polyethylene glycol (PEG8000) solution at -1.5MPa strongly improves chilling resistance. The aim of the present work was to investigate whether the beneficial effect of osmopriming is associated with restoration of the ascorbate-glutathione (ASC-GSH) cycle of mitochondria in soybean seeds. Compared with the control, both H(2)O(2) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents in mitochondria of osmoprimed seeds decreased after chilling treatment, and these changes were associated with increased activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione reductase (GR), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR) and L-galactono-gamma-lactone dehydrogenase (GLDH). However, the activity of dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) showed no obvious change during osmopriming treatment. Increased ASC and GSH contents accompanied prolonged osmopriming, and the reduced/oxidized ratios of ASC and GSH increased differently during osmopriming. These results indicate that osmopriming treatment enhances activity of the ASC-GSH cycle of mitochondria, which raises the chilling tolerance in soybean seeds and protects against H(2)O(2) that is generated in mitochondria during imbibition at low temperature.
