The present study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the Xpert((R)) MTB/RIF assay and compare Xpert results with solid and MGIT 960 liquid culture system. A total of 134 patients who had failed the Category I or II regimen were recruited for evaluation. Xpert correctly identified all Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates. The sensitivity and specificity of the Xpert assay for the detection of rifampicin resistance was respectively 98.2% and 97.0% when compared with MGIT 960 results.
