BACKGROUND: Isolation of mycobacteria in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients is increasingly being reported. Because of having long term antimicrobial treatment, CF patients are at risk of pulmonary infection with especially resistant nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) strains. The aim of the present study is to determine the prevalence of mycobacterium spp. and antimicrobial susceptibility in Turkish CF patients. METHODS: During a 5.5 year study period, 376 sputa from 130 CF patients were analyzed. Antimycobacterial susceptibility testing was performed by the Bactec 460 TB System and the E test method. RESULTS: Totaly 28 (7.44%) Mycobacterium spp. were isolated from eight (6.15%) CF patients. Five isolates (17.9%) were identified as Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), 14 (50%) as Mycobacterium abscessus and nine (32.1%) as Mycobacterium lentiflavum. All MTBC isolates were found to be susceptible to streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol. Resistance to some antibiotics was detected in some NTM strains. These are the first data about the prevalence of mycobacteria in CF patients from Turkey. CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric CF patients, specific mycobacterial analysis of sputum specimens and susceptibility testing should be performed for allowing early detection, identification and the possibility of eradication of these bacteria.
