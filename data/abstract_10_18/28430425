Population structures of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) isolated from catch basins, a constructed wetland, and feces from a beef cattle feedlot were compared over a two-year period. Enterococcus hirae accounted for 92% of the fecal isolates, whereas secondary environments were characterized by greater relative abundance of environmentally adapted species including Enterococcus casseliflavus. While enterococci densities in the catch basins and wetland were similar under wet and drought conditions, E. hirae predominated during rainy periods, while E. casseliflavus predominated during drought conditions. Environmentally adapted species accounted for almost half of the erythromycin resistant enterococci isolated from the wetland. Densities of Escherichia coli were also comparable during wet versus drought conditions, and the relative abundance of strains from environmentally adapted clades was greater in secondary environments compared to feces. Unlike enterococci, fewer environmentally adapted E. coli strains were isolated on selective media containing ceftriaxone from the wetland compared to feces, suggesting resistance to this antibiotic may not be well maintained in the absence of selective pressure. Overall, these findings suggest that secondary environments select for environmentally adapted FIB. While these species and clades tend to be of limited clinical relevance, they could potentially serve as reservoirs of antimicrobial resistance.
