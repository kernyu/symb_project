Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a major problem in clinical settings, and because it is resistant to most antimicrobial agents, MRSA infections are difficult to treat. We previously reported that synthetic macrocyclic bis(bibenzyl) derivatives, which were originally discovered in liverworts, had anti-MRSA activity. However, the action mechanism responsible was unclear. In the present study, we elucidated the action mechanism of macrocyclic bis(bibenzyl) RC-112 and its partial structure, IDPO-9 (2-phenoxyphenol). Survival experiments demonstrated that RC-112 had a bactericidal effect on MRSA, whereas IDPO-9 had bacteriostatic effects. IDPO-9-resistant mutants exhibited cross-resistance to triclosan, but not to RC-112. The mutation was identified in the fabI, enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase gene, a target of triclosan. We have not yet isolated the RC-112-resistant mutant. On the other hand, the addition of RC-112, unlike IDPO-9, caused the inflow of ethidium and propidium into S. aureus cells. RC-112-dependent ethidium outflow was observed in ethidium-loaded S. aureus cells. Transmission electron microscopy also revealed that S. aureus cells treated with RC-112 had intracellular lamellar mesosomal-like structures. Intracellular Na+ and K+ concentrations were significantly changed by the RC-112 treatment. These results indicated that RC-112 increased membrane permeability to ethidium, propidium, Na+, and K+, and also that the action mechanism of IDPO-9 was different from those of the other compounds.
