The present study investigated the effects of prebiotic fructooligosaccharide (FOS) on the innate immune response, stress resistance, digestive enzyme activities, growth factors and survival of Caspian Roach (Rutilus rutilus) fry. After acclimation, fish (0.67 +/- 0.03 g) were allocated into 12 tanks (50 fish per tank) and triplicate groups were fed a control diet or diets containing 1%, 2% or 3% FOS. At the end of the trial (7 weeks), humoral innate immune parameters (serum Ig levels, lysozyme activity and alternative complement activity (ACH50)), resistance to salinity stress (150 g L(-1)), digestive enzyme activities (amylase, lipase and protease) and growth factors (final weight, weight gain, specific growth rate (SGR), food conversion ratio (FCR), and condition factor) were assessed. At the end of the study the innate immune responses (Ig levels, lysozyme activity and ACH50) were significantly higher in 2% and 3% FOS fed fish (P < 0.05), whereas, 1% dietary FOS only elevated serum lysozyme activity. All dietary FOS levels significantly increased resistance to a salinity stress challenge (P < 0.05) and highest survival was observed in the 3% FOS group. Similarly, digestive enzyme activities were significantly elevated with increasing levels of dietary FOS (P < 0.05). Subsequently, elevated growth performance (final weight, SGR and FCR) was observed in roach fed 2% and 3% FOS compared to the control group (P < 0.05). These results indicate that FOS can be considered as a beneficial dietary supplement for improving the immune response, stress resistance, digestive enzyme activities and growth performance of Caspian roach fry.
