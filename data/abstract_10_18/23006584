The diversity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has given rise to multiple subtypes and recombinant strains. The majority of research into antiretroviral agents and drug resistance has been performed on subtype B viruses, yet non-subtype B strains are responsible for 90% of global infections. Although it seems that combination antiretroviral regimens are effective against all HIV-1 subtypes, there is emerging evidence of subtype differences in drug resistance, relevant to antiretroviral strategies in different parts of the world. For this purpose, extensive sampling of HIV genetic diversity, curation and analyses are required to inform antiretroviral strategies in different parts of the world.
