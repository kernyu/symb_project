A series of novel benzoxazinyl-oxazolidinones bearing nonaromatic heterocycle or aryl groups were designed and synthesized. Their in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities were investigated. Most of the (3S, 3aS) biaryl benzoxazinyl-oxazolidinones exhibited potent activity against Gram-positive pathogens. SAR trends were observed; a pyridyl C ring was preferable to other 5- or 6-member aryl C rings, while fluorine substitution on the B ring generated derivatives with reduced activity. Various substituent group positions on the pyridyl ring were also evaluated. The resulting compounds displayed excellent activity against linezolid-resistant strains. Compound 45 exhibited excellent in vitro activity, with a MIC value of 0.25-0.5 mug/mL against MRSA and an activity against linezolid-resistant strains of 8-16-fold higher potency than linezolid. In a MRSA systemic infection model, compound 45 displayed an ED(50) < 5.0 mg/kg, a potency that is nearly 3-fold better than that of linezolid. This compound also showed excellent pharmacokinetic profiles, with a half-life of more than 5 h as well as an oral bioavailability of 81% in rats.
