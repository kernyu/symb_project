We report for the first time 2 cases of multidrug-resistant Burkholderia cenocepacia J2315 isolated from blood samples of patients without cystic fibrosis from a pediatric unit in a hospital in India. The first patient presented with community-acquired bacteremia, and the second patient was immunocompromised and developed hospital-acquired infection approximately 17 days after admission. The isolates from both patients were multidrug-resistant and strong biofilm producers. Surveillance cultures identified the secondary sources of the infections, but not the primary sources.
