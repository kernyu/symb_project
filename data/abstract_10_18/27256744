The combination of daclatasvir and asunaprevir is efficacious in the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, but its efficacy and predictors of efficacy in the elderly (>/=70 years) remain unclear. In this study, 844 patients with chronic HCV genotype 1b infection, were treated with daclatasvir (60 mg once daily) plus asunaprevir (100 mg twice daily) for 24 weeks. Using the intention-to-treat analysis, the sustained virological response (SVR) rates were 87% and 88% for all 844 patients and 411 elderly (>70 years of age), respectively. In both groups, multivariate analysis identified NS5A-Y93H mutation (<20%), pretreatment (failure of treatment except for triple therapy with simeprevir, or treatment naive), and level of viremia (<6.0 log IU/ml) as independent predictors of SVR. Direct sequencing showed a significantly higher rate of NS3-D168 mutation at baseline in non-responders to triple therapy with simeprevir (44%) than others (2%). Alfa-fetoprotein (AFP) level and liver stiffness were significantly lower after end of treatment than at baseline, in both the SVR and non-SVR groups. In conclusion, daclatasvir-asunaprevir combination achieved high SVR in HCV genotype 1b patients, including elderly patients. Viral factors negatively influenced the response to treatment. Treatment improved AFP level and liver stiffness (surrogate markers of hepatocellular carcinoma), regardless of treatment efficacy. J. Med. Virol. 89:91-98, 2017. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
