Development of novel antibacterial agents is required to control infection with multidrug-resistant Streptococcus suis. HolSMP and LySMP, the holin and lysin of S. suis serotype 2 bacteriophage, named SMP, are responsible for lysis of host cells and release of progeny phage. HolSMP and LySMP expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) exerted efficient activity at 37 degrees C, pH 5.2, with addition of 0.8 % beta-mercaptoethanol. Lytic spectra of purified HolSMP, LySMP or HolSMP + LySMP mixture were investigated. HolSMP, exhibiting a narrow lytic spectrum, was effective against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis, which were insensitive to LySMP. Moreover, HolSMP was identified as a promising antibacterial agent which was able to extend the spectrum of LySMP. The data suggest that combined use of holin and lysin could be a candidate strategy for resolution of drug resistance.
