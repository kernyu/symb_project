Enhancement of biocompatibility and antibacterial properties of implant materials is potentially beneficial for their practical value. Therefore, the use of metallic and metallic oxide nanoparticles as antimicrobial coatings components which induce minimized antibacterial resistance receives currently particular attention. In this work, TiO2 nanotubes layers loaded with ZnO and Ag nanoparticles were designed for biomedical coatings and delivery systems and evaluated for antimicrobial activity. TiO2 nanotubes themselves exhibited considerable and diameter-dependent antibacterial activity against planktonic Staphylococcus epidermidis cells but favored bacterial adhesion. Loading of nanotubes with moderate amount of ZnO nanoparticles significantly diminished S. epidermidis cell adhesion and viability just after 1.5h contact with modified surfaces. However, an increase of loaded ZnO amount unexpectedly altered the structure of nanoparticle-nanolayer, caused partial closure of nanotube interior and significantly reduced ZnO solubility and antibacterial efficacy. Co-deposition of Ag nanoparticles enhanced the antibacterial properties of synthesized coatings. However, the increase of ZnO quantity on Ag nanoparticles co-deposited surfaces favored the adhesion of bacterial cells. Thus, ZnO/Ag/TiO2 nanotube composite layers may be promising delivery systems for combating post-operative infections in hard tissue replacement procedures. However, the amount of loaded antibacterial agents must be carefully balanced to avoid the overdose and reduced efficacy.
