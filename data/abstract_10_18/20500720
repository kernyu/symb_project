Feline orbital aspergillosis is increasingly described in the published reports and may be an emerging disease. Orbital mycotic infections were diagnosed in three cats with exophthalmos, significant dorso-temporal globe deviation and pronounced resistance to retropulsion. Advanced imaging was performed in all three cases to evaluate the extent of disease as well as to obtain guided orbital biopsies in two cases. Surgical intervention in the form of a lateral orbitotomy was pursued in the first case with the other two cases treated with enucleation or medical management alone. The available published reports concerning sino-orbital aspergillosis are reviewed. Oral therapy with a novel triazole, voriconazole, was instituted in two cases. Although voriconazole was apparently effective against the fungal organisms, it is also resulted in adverse reactions.
