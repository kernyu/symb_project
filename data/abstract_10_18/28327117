BACKGROUND: Alternative treatment strategies have become essential in overcoming the problem of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). In this preliminary in vitro study, the anti-tuberculosis (anti-TB) activity of exogenous iron chelators (xenosiderophores) such as Exochelin-MS (Exo-MS) and Deferoxamine-B (DFO-B) was evaluated against ten multi-drug-resistant (MDR) and seven pyrazinamide-resistant (PZA (R) ) Mtb isolates. METHODS: Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube-Drug Susceptibility Test was used to assess the anti-TB effect of Exo-MS or DFO-B individually and their combinations with isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RIF) and pyrazinamide (PZA). RESULTS: For the MDR-Mtb isolates, Exo-MS alone inhibited two out of the five isolates tested. Whereas, DFO-B alone inhibited nine out of the ten MDR isolates tested. For PZA-resistant Mtb isolates, both Exo-MS and DFO-B individually inhibited five out of the seven isolates. The MIC of Exo-MS in combination with INH, RIF and PZA remained the same. The MIC of DFO-B decreased when tested in combination with INH, RIF and PZA. CONCLUSIONS: Exo-MS and DFO-B were shown to have activity against drug-resistant Mtb isolates. Therefore, these xenosiderophores may be useful adjuncts to antibiotics in overcoming the problem of drug-resistant Mtb in clinical setting.
