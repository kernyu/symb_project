Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are important and frequently used elements of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. However, the development of drug resistance, as well as the side effects of existing drugs, defines a medical need for novel NNRTIs with excellent tolerability, improved activity against NNRTI-resistant viruses, and a low barrier to resistance. Within the chemical class of diarylpyrazole-[imidazolidinone]-carboxamides, AIC292 was identified as a promising novel HIV-1 NNRTI and has successfully completed single-dose clinical phase I studies. Here, we report on the antiviral activity of AIC292, evaluated in vitro against wild-type and NNRTI-resistant HIV-1 isolates and in vivo using an engineered mouse xenograft model. AIC292 inhibited wild-type HIV-1 laboratory strains at low nanomolar concentrations, was well tolerated in different cell lines, and showed excellent selectivity in a lead profiling screen. In addition, activity of AIC292 could be demonstrated against a broad panel of wild-type HIV-1 group M and group O clinical isolates. AIC292 also retained activity against viruses harboring NNRTI resistance-associated mutations (RAMs), including the most prevalent variants, K103N, Y181C, and G190A. Interestingly, viruses bearing the L100I RAM were hypersusceptible to AIC292. Two-drug combination assays showed no antagonistic interactions between AIC292 and representative marketed HIV drugs with regard to antiviral activity. Furthermore, AIC292 displayed potent antiviral in vivo efficacy in a mouse xenograft model when applied once daily. Taken together, these data show that AIC292 represents a molecule with the antiviral properties of a novel NNRTI for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.
