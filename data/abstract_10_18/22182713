BACKGROUND: Animals persistently infected (PI) with bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) are a key source of viral propagation within and among herds. Currently, no specific therapy exists to treat PI animals. The purpose of this research was to initiate evaluation of the pharmacokinetic and safety data of a novel antiviral agent in BVDV-free calves and to assess the antiviral efficacy of the same agent in PI calves. METHODS: One BVDV-free calf was treated with 2-(2-benzimidazolyl)-5-[4-(2-imidazolino)phenyl]furan dihydrochloride (DB772) once at a dose of 1.6 mg/kg intravenously and one BVDV-free calf was treated three times a day for 6 days at 9.5 mg/kg intravenously. Subsequently, four PI calves were treated intravenously with 12 mg/kg DB772 three times a day for 6 days and two PI control calves were treated with an equivalent volume of diluent only. RESULTS: Prior to antiviral treatment, the virus isolated from each calf was susceptible to DB772 in vitro. The antiviral treatment effectively inhibited virus for 14 days in one calf and at least 3 days in three calves. Subsequent virus isolated from the three calves was resistant to DB772 in vitro. No adverse effects of DB772 administration were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrate that DB772 administration is safe and exhibits antiviral properties in PI calves while facilitating the rapid development of viral resistance to this novel therapeutic agent.
