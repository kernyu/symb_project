Inappropriate antibiotic use contributes to antimicrobial resistance. Multi-faceted antimicrobial stewardship programmes (ASPs) are recommended for sustainable changes in prescribing practices. A multi-disciplinary ASP was established in October 2008 and piloted in the Departments of General Surgery, Renal Medicine and Endocrinology sequentially. To improve the quality of patient care via optimising the (1) choice, (2) dose, (3) route and (4) duration of antibiotics, a "whole-system" approach incorporating prospective review with immediate concurrent feedback (ICF), prescriber education (public or individualised), de-escalation of therapy, dose optimisation and parenteral-to-oral conversion, while recognising the autonomy of primary prescribers, was adopted. The audited department received a quarterly outcomes report and any common unaccepted practices would be addressed. Outcomes were analysed for 12 months post-ASP implementation. A total of 1,535 antibiotic prescriptions were reviewed. Antimicrobial use in 376 (24.5%) prescriptions was inappropriate. Of 596 interventions made, 70.2% were accepted. A reduction in audited antibiotics consumption resulted in acquisition cost savings of S$198,575 for the hospital. Patients' cost-savings attributable to ASP-initiated interventions were $91,194. The overall all-cause mortality rate and median monthly inpatient-days pre- and post-intervention remained stable. A "whole-system" ASP was effective in optimising antibiotic use in our hospital, without compromising clinical outcomes.
