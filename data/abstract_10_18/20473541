The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence and characteristics of knee prosthetic joint infections due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae. From 2000 to 2007, 132 infections out of 5,076 arthroplasties (2.6%) were registered. Seven out of 132 infections (5.3%) were due to ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli in six cases and Klebsiella pneumoniae in one. Open debridement and retention of the implant was the first surgical approach and all patients received intravenous carbapenems. Relapse was documented in four cases and remission in three. Therefore, debridement without prosthesis removal was associated with a high failure rate.
