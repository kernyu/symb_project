Adaptor protein ClpS is an essential regulator of prokaryotic ATP-dependent protease ClpAP, which delivers certain protein substrates with specific amino acid sequences to ClpAP for degradation. However, ClpS also functions as the inhibitor of the ClpAP-mediated protein degradation for other proteins. Here, we constructed the clpS-overexpression Mycobacterium smegmatis strain, and showed for the first time that overexpression of ClpS increased the resistance of M. smegmatis to rifampicin that is one of most widely used antibiotic drugs in treatment of tuberculosis. Using quantitative proteomic technology, we systematically analyzed effects of ClpS overexpression on changes in M. smegmatis proteome, and proposed that the increased rifampicin resistance was caused by ClpS-regulated drug sedimentation and drug metabolism. Our results indicate that the changes in degradation related proteins enhanced drug resistance and quantitative proteomic analysis is an important tool for understanding molecular mechanisms responsible for bacteria drug resistance.
