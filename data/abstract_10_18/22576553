This theoretical study proposes a reflection on the intrinsic resistance of the subclass Coccidia, particularly the genus Cryptosporidium, considered to be potential pathogens for immunocompromised patients, and the implications for nursing practice. Currently, the international and national guidelines support the chemical disinfection of digestive system endoscopes after their cleansing as a safe and effective procedure. However, studies show that microorganisms of the subclass Coccidia, namely Cryptosporidium, responsible for enteric infection, are more resistant than mycobacteria and are not inactivated by high-level disinfectants, except for hydrogen peroxide 6% and 7.5%, which are not currently available in Brazil. We conclude that the legislation should include this agent among test microorganisms for approving high-level disinfectants. Health authorities should make efforts to ensure that healthcare institutions have access to effective disinfectants against Cryptosporidium.
