We investigated the presence of qnrC and qnrD among 756 non-replicate Enterobacteriaceae isolated in Italy, selected for being non-susceptible to fluoroquinolones and/or resistant to third-generation cephalosporins. Four Proteus mirabilis and one Morganella morganii (0.66% of the total) presented a qnrD gene, located in a 2687-base-pair plasmid that was entirely sequenced. The plasmid is un-typable, and contains no known coding region other than qnrD. That the qnrD gene was found in four unrelated P. mirabilis and in one M. morganii isolate might suggest a frequent association of this gene with the tribe Proteeae.
