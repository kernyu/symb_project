Clerodendron trichotomum leaves and Rumex aquatica herbs are used as a folk medicine for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, but their active ingredients are not known until now. We isolated caffeic acid and phenylpropanoid glycosides, 1-O-caffeoyl glycoside and acteoside [beta-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl) ethyl-O-alpha-l-rhamnopyranosyl(1-->3)-beta-d-(4-O-caffeoyl)-glucopyranoside] from their ethylacetate fractions, respectively, and evaluated their anti-asthmatic effects on the aerosolized ovalbumin (OA) challenge in the OA-sensitized guinea-pigs measuring the specific airway resistance (sRaw) during the immediate-phase response (IAR) and late-phase response (LAR), and also measured recruitment of leukocytes and chemical mediators on the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) in LAR, as well as histopathological survey. Acteoside and 1-O-caffeoyl glycoside (25mg/kg) significantly (P<0.05) inhibited sRaw by 32.14 and 26.79% in IAR, and by 55.88% and 52.94% in LAR, respectively, whereas caffeic acid (25mg/kg) inhibited sRaw by 30.36% in IAR and 44.12% in LAR, compared to control, but with less effective than dexamethasone, disodium cromoglycate, and salbutamol, respectively. In addition, phenylpropanoid glycosides (25mg/kg) significantly inhibited the recruitments of leukocytes, particularly neutrophils and eosinophils into lung, Furthermore, 1-O-caffeoyl glycoside, acteoside and caffeic acid significantly (P<0.05) inhibited protein content at a dose of 25mg/kg, and histamine content and PLA(2) activity at a dose of 50mg/kg, in BALF. Acteoside had more active than caffeic acid and 1-O-caffeoyl glycoside. However, their anti-asthmatic effects were less than the reference drugs. These results indicated that caffeic acid and its glycosides (25mg/kg) have anti-asthmatic effect as the same manner with dexamethasone and disodium cromoglycate.
