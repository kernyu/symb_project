Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are essential parameters in molecular diagnostics and can be used for the early detection and clinical prognosis in various diseases. Available methods for SNP detection are still labor-intensive and require a complex laboratory infrastructure, which are not suitable for the usage in resource-limited settings. Thus, there is an urgent need for a simple, reliable and rapid approach. In this paper we modified the previously developed competitive reporter monitored amplification (CMA) technique for the detection of resistance mediating SNPs in Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) strains. As a proof-of-principle for the application of the CMA-based SNP assay in routine molecular tuberculosis diagnostic, we show that the assay recognizes resistance mediating SNPs for rifampicin, isoniazid and ethambutol from either isolated DNA or heat inactivated M. tuberculosis cell cultures. The CMA-based SNP assay can identify the most prevalent resistance mediating mutations in the genes rpoB, katG, embB, and the promotor region of inhA within one hour.
