INTRODUCTION: With the currently available combined antiretroviral therapy regimens, durable suppression of viral replication, preservation of immune function and normalizing life expectancy, are all becoming achievable goals. Teenagers and young adults living with HIV present unique clinical and pharmacologic challenges to optimizing antiretroviral treatment outcomes. Areas covered: In this expert review of the topic, we examine recent clinical trial data and draw on our program's 25 year experience working with both perinatally and behaviorally HIV infected adolescents. Expert commentary: In order to be effective, the antiretrovirals we provide must be combined with multidisciplinary interventions and ongoing socio-behavioral support to ensure treatment adherence and prevent the emergence of viral resistance.
