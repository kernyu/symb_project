OBJECTIVES: Passive immunization for the prevention of HIV-1 infection is currently being reenergized. The anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody ibalizumab has demonstrated safety and efficacy in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials for treatment of HIV-1 infection and is undergoing a phase 1 clinical trial in HIV-1 uninfected individuals for prevention. Here, we sought to assess ibalizumab antiviral breadth and potency and to identify determinants of natural preexisting resistance. METHODS: Ibalizumab breadth and potency was assessed against a large clinically relevant panel of HIV-1 pseudoviruses (n = 116) commonly used to assess vaccine candidates. Determinants of resistance were assessed by sequence analysis. RESULTS: Ibalizumab neutralized 92% and 66% of viruses as defined by 50% and 80% inhibition, respectively. Median in vitro neutralization potency by IC50 was 0.03 mug/mL, substantially lower than the broadly neutralizing mAbs, PG9, or VRC01. The dominant determinant of resistance was the absence of a potential N-linked glycosylation site (PNGS) at the V5 N-terminus (P < 0.001), with the V2 loop length possibly influencing the degree of resistance afforded by the absence of the V5 N-terminal PNGS (P = 0.001). Other significant independent correlates of resistance included PNGS at position 386 and the side chain length of residue 375. Ibalizumab exhibited complementary resistance to VRC01 (P = 0.006) and sCD4 (P < 0.001), in part mediated by the V5 PNGS. CONCLUSIONS: Ibalizumab breadth and potency compared favorably with broadly neutralizing anti-HIV-1 monoclonal antibodies, supporting the clinical development of ibalizumab, alone or in combination, for HIV-1 prevention.
