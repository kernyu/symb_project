BACKGROUND: To evaluate in vitro and in vivo efficacies of linezolid, vancomycin, and the combination of linezolid and rifampicin against two Staphylococcus aureus strains with reduced susceptibility to beta-lactams and one of them also to glycopeptides. METHODS: In vitro killing curves and a rabbit model: Meningitis was induced by intracisternal inoculation of 10(8) CFU/ml of each strain. Five hours later (0 h), rabbits were randomly assigned to control or to therapeutic groups. CSF bacterial counts, lactate and protein concentrations, and pharmacokinetic parameters were determined. RESULTS: In vivo: linezolid and its combination with rifampicin reduced bacterial concentrations at 24 h, median cfu/mL 4.85 vs 3.87 (p < 0.05) for linezolid and 5.02 vs 4.21 (p < 0.05) for linezolid + rifampicin, against the glycopeptide intermediate S. aureus (GISA) strain and improved inflammatory parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the need for more experimental data, our results suggest that linezolid and its combinations could be considered as a potential alternative in difficult-to-treat CNS infections and especially in those due to GISA strains and deserve more studies.
