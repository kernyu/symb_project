We report a new class of peptide mimetics, alpha-AApeptides, that display broad-spectrum activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and fungi. With non-hemolytic activity, resistance to protease hydrolysis, and easy sequence programmability, alpha-AApeptides may emerge as a novel class of antibiotics.
