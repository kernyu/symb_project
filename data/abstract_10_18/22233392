Infection by enteric bacterial pathogens activates pathogen recognition receptors, leading to innate responses that promote host defence. While responses that promote host 'resistance' to infection, through the release of antimicrobial mediators, or the recruitment of inflammatory cells aimed at clearing the infection are best known, recent studies have begun to identify additional innate driven responses that instead promote intestinal tissue repair and host survival. Described as infection 'tolerance' responses, we and others have primarily studied these responses in the Citrobacter rodentium infection model. In this review we discuss the impact of innate resistance mechanisms on host defence, and describe how 'tolerance' responses act primarily on the intestinal epithelium, triggering epithelial cell proliferation, repair or promoting barrier function. Resistance and tolerance responses appear to work together, with tolerance repairing the tissue injury caused by resistance driven inflammation. Tolerance responses fit a pattern where innate immunity and inflammation are tightly regulated in the gastrointestinal tract. Moreover, tolerance may have developed due to the successful subversion and avoidance of host resistance by enteric bacterial pathogens. Further studies are needed to clarify the contribution of different pathogen recognition receptors to tolerance and resistance responses against bacterial pathogens, in the gut or in other host tissues.
