The aim of this work was to identify at the molecular level the species of coagulase-positive staphylococci isolates from clinical and subclinical bovine mastitis samples in Southern Brazil, and to evaluate the antimicrobial resistance profile, as well as the presence of resistance genes. According to the PCR assay, all 31 isolates were classified as Staphylococcus aureus. The isolates were tested for resistance to penicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, cefoxitin, cephalothin, ceftiofur, streptomycin, tobramycin, teicoplanin, erythromycin, clindamycin, enrofloxacin, sulfonamide, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and tetracycline by the disk diffusion method. Most of the isolates were resistant to sulfonamide (20), followed by ampicillin and clindamycin (16). Twenty isolates were multidrug-resistant. PCR was used for the detection of several antimicrobial resistance genes (ereB, ermB, ermC, tetA, tetB, tetK, tetL, tetM, tetO, Tn916-1545, strA, strB, sul1, sul2, dfrA, dfrG, dfrK, blaZ, mecA, and mecC). The most prevalent antimicrobial resistance genes were tetK and tetL, ereB, followed by tetM, Tn916-1545 and blaZ, detected in 11, nine and four isolates, respectively. For all the tetM gene positive isolates, the presence of conjugative transposons of the Tn916-1545 family was detected. The presence of multidrug-resistant isolates, antimicrobial resistance genes and transposons suggests a potential risk of spreading multi-resistance genes to other bacteria.
