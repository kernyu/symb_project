BACKGROUND: Tenofovir (TFV) causes kidney tubular dysfunction (KTD) in some patients, but the mechanism is poorly understood. Genetic variants in TFV transporters are implicated; we explored whether ABCC10 transports TFV and whether ABCC10 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with KTD. METHODS: TFV accumulation was assessed in parental and ABCC10-transfected HEK293 cells (HEK293-ABCC10), CD4(+) cells and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). Substrate specificity was confirmed by cepharanthine (ABCC10 inhibitor) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) studies. Fourteen SNPs in ABCC10 were genotyped in human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients with KTD (n = 19) or without KTD (controls; n = 96). SNP and haplotype analysis was performed using Haploview. RESULTS: TFV accumulation was significantly lower in HEK293-ABCC10 cell lines than in parental HEK293 cells (35% lower; P = .02); this was reversed by cepharanthine. siRNA knockdown of ABCC10 resulted in increased accumulation of TFV in CD4(+) cells (18%; P = .04) and MDMs (25%; P = .04). Two ABCC10 SNPs (rs9349256: odds ratio [OR], 2.3; P = .02; rs2125739, OR, 2.0; P = .05) and their haplotype (OR, 2.1; P = .05) were significantly associated with KTD. rs9349256 was associated with urine phosphorus wasting (P = .02) and beta2 microglobulinuria (P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: TFV is a substrate for ABCC10, and genetic variability within the ABCC10 gene may influence TFV renal tubular transport and contribute to the development of KTD. These results need to be replicated in other cohorts.
