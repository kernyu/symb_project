OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology, spectrum of activity, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, efficacy, administration, and considerations for clinical use of meropenem/vaborbactam (M/V). DATA SOURCES: A literature search using PubMed and clinicaltrials.gov (June 2013 to December 2017) was conducted using the search terms meropenem, vaborbactam, RPX7009, biapenem, RPX2003, and carbavance. References from relevant articles and conference abstracts were also reviewed. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Preclinical, phase I studies, and phase III studies written in the English language were evaluated. DATA SYNTHESIS: M/V is a novel carbapenem/beta-lactamase inhibitor antimicrobial with in vitro activity against nearly 99% of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. M/V is approved for the treatment of adults with complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs), including pyelonephritis. In a phase III cUTI trial (TANGO I), 98.4% of patients treated with M/V experienced overall clinical success compared with 94% of patients treated with piperacillin/tazobactam (95% CI = 0.7 to 9.1). When compared with best available therapy for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) infections in TANGO II, patients receiving M/V were more likely to achieve clinical cure at both the end of therapy (64.3% vs 33.3%, P = 0.04) as well as at the test of cure (57.1% vs 26.7%, P = 0.04). The most common adverse effects associated with M/V were headache, infusion-site reactions, and diarrhea. CONCLUSION: M/V has a valuable role in the treatment of CRE and should be used judiciously to preserve its use for resistant infections.
