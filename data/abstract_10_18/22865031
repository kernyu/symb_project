Viburnum opulus is a plant with fruits that are rich in biologically active substances, making it valuable to the food and pharmaceutical industries. Here, we present our study of the total phenolic and anthocyanin contents and antimicrobial activity in the fruit juice of six V. opulus L. accessions. The cultivar 'Krasnaya Grozd' was notable for its exceptionally large amount of total phenolics, 1168 mg/100 g, with anthocyanins comprising 3-5 % of the total phenolic content. The evaluation of the antimicrobial properties confirmed that the juice of V. opulus fruits strongly inhibited the growth of a wide range of human pathogenic bacteria, both Gram-negative (Salmonella typhimurium and S. agona) and Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Lysteria monocytogenes, and Enterococcus faecalis) organisms. Conversely, the yeasts Debaryomyces hansenii and Torulaspora delbrueckii showed complete resistance to the fruit juice, whereas a low sensitivity was demonstrated by Trichosporon cutaneum, Kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, S. cerevisiae 12R, and Candida parapsilosis.
