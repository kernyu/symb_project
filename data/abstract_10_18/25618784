AIMS: Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is linked to binge drinking and cigarette smoking. Heavy chronic +/- binge alcohol, or low-level exposures to dietary nitrosamines cause steatohepatitis with insulin resistance and oxidative stress in animal models. This study examines hepatotoxic effects of sub-mutagenic exposures to tobacco-specific nitrosamine (NNK) in relation to ALD. METHODS: Long Evans rats were fed liquid diets containing 0 or 26% (caloric) ethanol (EtOH) for 8 weeks. In Weeks 3 through 8, rats were treated with NNK (2 mg/kg) or saline by i.p. injection, 3x/week, and in Weeks 7 and 8, EtOH-fed rats were binge-administered 2 g/kg EtOH 3x/week; controls were given saline. RESULTS: EtOH +/- NNK caused steatohepatitis with necrosis, disruption of the hepatic cord architecture, ballooning degeneration, early fibrosis, mitochondrial cytopathy and ER disruption. Severity of lesions was highest in the EtOH+NNK group. EtOH and NNK inhibited insulin/IGF signaling through Akt and activated pro-inflammatory cytokines, while EtOH promoted lipid peroxidation, and NNK increased apoptosis. O(6)-methyl-Guanine adducts were only detected in NNK-exposed livers. CONCLUSION: Both alcohol and NNK exposures contribute to ALD pathogenesis, including insulin/IGF resistance and inflammation. The differential effects of EtOH and NNK on adduct formation are critical to ALD progression among alcoholics who smoke.
