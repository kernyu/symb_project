Carbapenemases, with versatile hydrolytic capacity against beta-lactams, are now an important cause of resistance of Gram-negative bacteria. The genes encoding for the acquired carbapenemases are associated with a high potential for dissemination. In addition, infections due to Gram-negative bacteria with acquired carbapenemase production would lead to high clinical mortality rates. Of the acquired carbapenemases, Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (Ambler class A), Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase (Ambler class B), New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (Ambler class B) and many OXA enzymes (OXA-23-like, OXA-24-like, OXA-48-like, OXA-58-like, class D) are considered to be responsible for the worldwide resistance epidemics. As compared with monotherapy with colistin or tigecycline, combination therapy has been shown to effectively lower case-fatality rates. However, development of new antibiotics is crucial in the present pandrug-resistant era.
