Skin and soft tissue infections represent a continuum of symptoms that range from uncomplicated cellulitis to the potentially lethal entity necrotizing fasciitis that is often considered to be microbial invasions of the epidermis, dermis and subcutaneous tissues. Garenoxacin, a newer oral des-fluoroquinolone having potent antimicrobial activity against wide variety of common pathogens involved in skin and skin structure infections (SSTIs), including the resistant strains offer the advantage of broad spectrum of coverage including gram positive, gram negative and anaerobic organisms. This case study indicates the utility of garenoxacin in treating skin and soft tissue infections caused by road traffic accidents.
