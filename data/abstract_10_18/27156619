Pyrazinamide (PZA) is an important first-line anti-tuberculosis drug, however, there are relatively few available data on PZA resistant (PZA-R) rate in China. From June 2009 to June 2012, we selected 493 isolates from five field settings in China to investigate PZA-R by pncA gene sequencing. The result showed that PZA-R rate was 1.0% (2/196) among pan-susceptible isolates, 3.1% (4/130) among isoniazid (INH) mono-resistant isolates, 14.0% (6/43) among rifampin (RIF) mono-resistant isolates and 43.5% (54/124) among multidrug resistant (MDR) isolates. MDR tuberculosis (TB), RIF mono-resistance, and retreatment were found to be risk factors for PZA-R. Newly diagnosed PZA-R TB patients and clustered isolates with identical pncA mutations indicate that transmission of PZA-R isolates plays an important role in emergence of PZA-R TB. The results suggest that, it is necessary to conduct PZA susceptibility test among MDR isolates and modify the treatment regimens accordingly.
