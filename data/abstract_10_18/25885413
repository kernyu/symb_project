BACKGROUND: Chromosomally encoded AmpC beta-lactamases may be acquired by transmissible plasmids which consequently can disseminate into bacteria lacking or poorly expressing a chromosomal bla AmpC gene. Nowadays, these plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases are found in different bacterial species, namely Enterobacteriaceae, which typically do not express these types of beta-lactamase such as Klebsiella spp. or Escherichia coli. This study was performed to characterize two E. coli isolates collected in two different Portuguese hospitals, both carrying a novel CMY-2-type beta-lactamase-encoding gene. FINDINGS: Both isolates, INSRA1169 and INSRA3413, and their respective transformants, were non-susceptible to amoxicillin, amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, cephalothin, cefoxitin, ceftazidime and cefotaxime, but susceptible to cefepime and imipenem, and presented evidence of synergy between cloxacilin and cefoxitin and/or ceftazidime. The genetic characterization of both isolates revealed the presence of bla CMY-46 and bla CMY-50 genes, respectively, and the following three resistance-encoding regions: a Citrobacter freundii chromosome-type structure encompassing a blc-sugE-bla CMY-2-type -ampR platform; a sul1-type class 1 integron with two antibiotic resistance gene cassettes (dfrA1 and aadA1); and a truncated mercury resistance operon. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes two new bla CMY-2-type genes in E. coli isolates, located within a C. freundii-derived fragment, which may suggest their mobilization through mobile genetic elements. The presence of the three different resistance regions in these isolates, with diverse genetic determinants of resistance and mobile elements, may further contribute to the emergence and spread of these genes, both at a chromosomal or/and plasmid level.
