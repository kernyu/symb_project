Currently, praziquantel is the drug of choice for the treatment of human Schistosoma mansoni infections. It has not been proved until now that there is real praziquantel resistance, but there is decreased praziquantel sensitivity. A search for novel antischistosomal agents against the parasite has been given a high priority. Dihydroartemisinin, formerly identified as an antimalarial drug, has been shown to be active against both Schistosoma japonicum and S. mansoni in mice. Interestingly, dihydroartemisinin is found to be highly effective against the 14-28-day schistosomula of S. mansoni, and treatment with multiple low doses of the drug achieves a high efficacy with reduced toxicity to the host. The long time development from juveniles to adults allows adequate timing for treatment of this neglected tropical disease. It is supposed that dihydroartemisinin, a safe orally administered agent, may be used for the prevention and control of human S. mansoni infections, notably in areas with reduced praziquantel sensitivity or praziquantel resistance detected.
