Nosocomial infections which exhibit an increasing trend worldwide, are important contributors to morbidity and mortality. Most bacteria that cause nosocomial infections can retain their viability even after exposure to disinfectants in routine practice. This study was conducted to determine the susceptibilities of nosocomial Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp. isolates to various disinfectants. A total of 30 S.aureus [16 were methicillin-resistant (MRSA), 14 were methicillin-susceptible (MSSA)] and 21 Enterococcus spp. (13 E.faecalis, 7 E.faecium, 1 non-typable Enterococcus spp.) strains isolated from clinical samples of hospitalized patients as nosocomial infection agents in the Central Microbiology Laboratory of Ibn-i Sina Hospital, Ankara University, Faculty of Medicine, were included in the study. Glutaraldehyde (2% wt/vol), chlorhexidine gluconate (4% wt/vol), 2-propanol (70% vol/vol), povidone iodine (7.5% wt/vol), povidone iodine (10% wt/vol) and hydrogen peroxide (3% wt/vol) susceptibilities of the isolates were investigated by quantitative suspension test at contact times of 3, 5, and 10 minutes. All of the isolates were found susceptible to glutaraldehyde (2%), chlorhexidine gluconate (4%), povidone iodine (7.5%), povidone iodine (10%) and 2-propanol (70%) at all tested contact times. However, 12 S.aureus (5 MSSA, 7 MRSA) and 3 enterococci (2 E.faecium, 1 E.faecalis) isolates were found susceptible to hydrogen peroxide (3%) at 3 minutes contact time; 11 S.aureus (4 MSSA, 7 MRSA) and 7 E.faecalis isolates were found susceptible at 5 minutes contact time, and 6 S.aureus (4 MSSA, 2 MRSA) and 3 enterococci (1 E.faecium, 2 E.faecalis) isolates were found susceptible at 10 minutes contact time. One MSSA and 8 enterococci (4 E.faecium, 3 E.faecalis, 1 Enterococcus spp.) isolates were found resistant to hydrogen peroxide (3%) at 10 minutes contact time. In conclusion, glutaraldehyde (2%), chlorhexidine gluconate (4%), povidone iodine (7.5%), povidone iodine (10%) and 2-propanol (70%) can be safely used against S.aureus and Enterococcus spp. owing to their high effectiveness, however, hydrogen peroxide (3%) should not be preferred against those strains due to the presence of resistant isolates, in Ankara University Ibn-i Sina Hospital.
