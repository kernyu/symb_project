In this work, we characterized the gene encoding iron superoxide dismutase-A (FeSOD-A) in wild-type (WTS) and antimony-resistant (SbR) L. (Viannia) braziliensis and L. (Leishmania) infantum lines, which were selected in vitro. FeSOD-A transcript and protein expression were similar in all tested lines; however, specific enzyme activity analysis revealed higher superoxide dismutase activity in SbIII-resistant LbSbR and LiSbR lines than in the corresponding WTS lines. These parasites were also more tolerant to oxidative stress generated by the herbicide paraquat. Functional analysis showed that in comparison to non-transfected lines, wild-type LbWTS and LiWTS clones overexpressing the FeSOD-A enzyme are 1.6- and 1.7-fold more resistant to SbIII, respectively. Our results suggest that FeSOD-A is involved in the antimony resistance phenotype in L. (V.) braziliensis and L. (L.) infantum.
