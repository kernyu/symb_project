The present work aims at identification of multiple drug-resistant pathogenic bacteria in a selected stretch, namely, Puri on the Bay of Bengal, India. Six stations at the coast of Puri were selected and samples of water and sediment were collected during the winter of 2008 and 2009 for this study. Thirty-eight pathogenic bacteria were isolated and identified from both the water and the sediment of 6 fixed stations (PU-1a, PU-1b, PU-2, PU-3, PU-4, and PU-5). The identified pathogens were Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis. Antibiotic sensitivity of the isolated bacteria was studied by using 12 selected antibiotics, commonly used for the medication of human beings and animals. The isolated pathogens from both the water and the sediment samples showed lowest resistance to chloramphenicol (C-30 mug) where as the pathogens showed highest level of resistance to ampicillin (10-mug) among the antibiotics used for the study. Among the isolated pathogens E. faecalis (PU-1a), P. aeruginosa (PU-2 and PU-3), E. coli (PU-3 and PU-4), and K. pneumonia (PU-4) showed resistance to more than four antibiotics. Out of the isolated species, 57.8% pathogens were multi-drug resistant. Antibiotic resistance indexes of all the stations were calculated and found to be in the range of 0.066 to 0.083.
