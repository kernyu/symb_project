BACKGROUND: Multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2; ABCC2) mediates the biliary excretion of glutathione, glucuronide, and sulfate conjugates of endobiotics and xenobiotics. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of MRP2 contribute to interindividual variability in drug disposition and ultimately in drug response. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the transport function of human wild-type (WT) MRP2 and four SNP variants, S789F, A1450T, V417I, and T1477M. METHODS: The four SNP variants were expressed in Sf9 cells using recombinant baculovirus infection. The kinetic parameters [Km, (mumol/l); V(max), (pmol/mg/min); the Hill coefficient] of ATP-dependent transport of leukotriene C(4) (LTC(4)), estradiol-3-glucuronide (E(2)3G), estradiol-17beta-glucuronide (E(2)17G), and tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDC) were determined in Sf9-derived plasma membrane vesicles. Transport activity was normalized for expression level. RESULTS: The V(max) for transport activity was decreased for all substrates for S789F, and for all substrates except E(2)17G for A1450T. V417I showed decreased apparent affinity for LTC(4), E(2)3G, and E(2)17G, whereas transport was similar between wild-type (WT) and T1477M, except for a modest increase in TUDC transport. Examination of substrate-stimulated MRP2-dependent ATPase activity of S789F and A1450T, SNPs located in MRP2 nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), demonstrated significantly decreased ATPase activity and only modestly decreased affinity for ATP compared with WT. CONCLUSION: SNPs in the NBDs (S789F in the D-loop of NBD1, or A1450T near the ABC signature motif of NBD2) variably decreased the transport of all substrates. V417I in membrane spanning domain 1 selectively decreased the apparent affinity for the glutathione and glucuronide conjugated substrates, whereas the T1477M SNP in the carboxyl terminus altered only TUDC transport.
