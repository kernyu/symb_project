The NBS-LRR proteins encoded by the majority of R genes represent important intracellular receptors that directly or indirectly recognize pathogen effector proteins, which subsequently activate plant defense responses. In this study, a novel Plasmopara viticola-induced TIR-NBS-LRR gene, named VaRGA1, was cloned from leaf tissues of a highly downy mildew-resistant Vitis amurensis "Shuanghong" grapevine. The fluorescence signal of the VaRGA1-GFP fusion protein was clearly partitioned to the cytoplasm and nucleus. The expression of the VaRGA1 gene was strongly induced during early stages of infection by P. viticola, and was also significantly upregulated after drought and salt treatments. Accordingly, grapevine leaves transiently expressing the VaRGA1 gene manifested increased resistance to P. viticola, and the overexpression of the VaRGA1 gene in Nicotiana benthamiana conferred enhanced resistance to Phytophthora parasitica through the activation of salicylic acid (SA) signaling and phenylpropanoid pathways and could also increase tolerance to drought and salt stresses at the germination and vegetable growth stages. These findings indicate that the grapevine VaRGA1 gene may function as the immune and non-immune receptors against biotic and abiotic stresses and that there may be signaling overlap between biotic and abiotic responses.
