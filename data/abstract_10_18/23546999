In solid organ transplantation, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is considered to be the most important viral pathogen. We report a case of a CMV R-/D+ small intestine transplant recipient with a primary CMV infection on valganciclovir prophylaxis. Sequencing of the HCMV DNA for drug resistance-associated mutations revealed the UL97 mutation N510S. This mutation has been initially reported to confer ganciclovir resistance. Based on in vitro recombinant phenotyping, this assumption has recently been questioned. Switching the antiviral treatment to an intravenous regimen of ganciclovir eliminated HCMV DNAemia, showing the in vivo efficacy of ganciclovir for the UL97 mutation N510S. Hence, knowledge of drug efficacy is crucial for an adequate choice of antiviral medication, carefully balancing antiviral potency versus the risk of harmful side effects.
