Ceftazidime-avibactam resistance is mediated by blaKPC-3 mutations, which restore carbapenem susceptibility. We subjected Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates with different blaKPC-3 mutations (n = 5) or wild-type blaKPC-3 (n = 2) to serial passages with meropenem. The meropenem MIC against each isolate increased. Mutations in the ompK36 porin gene evolved in 5 isolates. Among isolates with D179Y substitutions in KPC-3, blaKPC-3 mutations reverted to wild type, were replaced by new mutations, or were retained. Carbapenem treatment of ceftazidime-avibactam-resistant K. pneumoniae infections may select for carbapenem resistance.
