With respect to parasite-induced infectious diseases of worldwide importance, members of the genera Plasmodium and Schistosoma are top pathogens. Nearly half a billion people suffer from malaria caused by Plasmodium spp. and schistosomiasis (bilharzia) induced by Schistosoma spp. Resistance against essentially all drugs used for malaria treatment has been reported. For schistosomiasis justified fear of upcoming resistance is discussed against the background of only one widely used drug for treatment. Research of the recent decade has demonstrated that essential steps of the biology of these and other parasites are controlled by kinases, which represent attractive targets for new-generation antiparasitic compounds. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Inhibitors of Protein Kinases.
