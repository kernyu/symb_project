To further the development of a model for simultaneously assessing intestinal absorption and first-pass metabolism in vitro, Caco-2, LS180, T84, and fetal human small intestinal epithelial cells (fSIECs) were cultured on permeable inserts, and the integrity of cell monolayers, CYP3A4 activity, and the inducibility of enzymes and transporters involved in intestinal drug disposition were measured. Caco-2, T84, and fSIECs all formed tight junctions, as assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy for zonula occludens-1, which was well organized into circumscribing strands in T84, Caco-2, and fSIECs but was diffuse in LS180 cells. The transepithelial electrical resistance value for LS180 monolayers was lower than that for Caco-2, T84, and fSIECs. In addition, the apical-to-basolateral permeability of the paracellular marker Lucifer yellow across LS180 monolayers was greater than in fSIECs, T84, and Caco-2 monolayers. The transcellular marker propranolol exhibited similar permeability across all cells. With regard to metabolic capacity, T84 and LS180 cells showed comparable basal midazolam hydroxylation activity and was inducible by rifampin and 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 in LS180 cells, but only marginally so in T84 cells. The basal CYP3A4 activity of fSIECs and Caco-2 cells was much lower and not inducible. Interestingly, some of the drug transporters expressed in LS180 and Caco-2 cells were induced by either 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 or rifampin or both, but effects were limited in the other two cell lines. These results suggest that none of the cell lines tested fully replicated the drug disposition properties of the small intestine and that the search for an ideal screening tool must continue.
