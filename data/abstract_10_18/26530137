As CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) play crucial immunomodulatory roles during infections, one key question is how these cells are controlled during antimicrobial immune responses. Mechanisms controlling their homeostasis are central to ensure efficient protection against pathogens, as well as to control infection-associated immunopathology. Here we studied how their viability is regulated in the context of mouse oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) infection, and found that these cells show increased protection from apoptosis during late phase of infection and reinfection. Tregs underwent reduced cell death because they are refractory to T cell receptor restimulation-induced cell death (RICD). We confirmed their resistance to RICD, using mouse and human Tregs in vitro, and by inducing alpha-CD3 antibody-mediated apoptosis in vivo. The enhanced viability is dependent on increased transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) signaling that results in upregulation of cFLIP (cellular FLICE (FADD-like IL-1beta-converting enzyme)-inhibitory protein) in Tregs. Protection from cell death is abrogated in the absence of TGF-beta1 signaling in Tregs during OPC infection. Taken together, our data unravel the previously unrecognized role of TGF-beta1 in promoting Treg viability, coinciding with the pronounced immunomodulatory role of these cells during later phase of OPC infection, and possibly other mucosal infections.
