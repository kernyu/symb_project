INTRODUCTION: Drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. This is at least partly due to late diagnosis and ineffective treatment of drug-resistant status. SOURCES OF DATA: Selective search of the literature on DR-TB supplemented by recent guidelines from the World Health Organization. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: Better and more rapid diagnosis of DR-TB by new techniques such as Xpert Mtb/RIF are likely to make a substantial impact on the disease. New therapeutics for DR-TB are entering, or about to enter the market for the first time in decades. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: It is not clear whether new treatments should be restricted for DR-TB or also used for drug-susceptible tuberculosis. GROWING POINTS: With several new agents on the horizon, there is the real possibility of an entirely new regimen for tuberculosis. AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: An inexpensive 'near-patient' diagnostic test is still needed. Optimizing new drug combination regimens in a timely manner is urgently required.
