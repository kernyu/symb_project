INTRODUCTION: Gardnerella vaginalis is one of the dominant etiological factors related to bacterial vaginosis. Literature offers a growing number of reports revealing there appear Gardnerella vaginalis strains increasingly resistant to metronidazole. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the susceptibility of Gardnerella vaginalis strains isolated from women with bacterial vaginosis to metronidazole, clindamycin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The investigation was performed on collection of 67 Gardnerella vaginalis strains isolated from the group of 604 women participating in the study Antibiotic sensitivity of strains was verified by E-test method (BioMerieux). Interpretation of results was performed in accordance with EUCAST criteria. RESULTS: All tested strains, apart from one, were sensitive to clindamycin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. The results of susceptibility test to metronidazole indicated that 68.7% (46 out of 67 strains) were resistant to this antibiotic, while all of them were sensitive to both clindamycin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. CONCLUSIONS: Near future may bring the need to change the treatment regimen of bacterial vaginosis.
