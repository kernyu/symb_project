To investigate HIV-1 subtype distribution and prevalence of HIV-1 drug resistance in Liuzhou and Nanning, a total of 304 HIV-infected subjects or AIDS patients from Liuzhou and Nanning were recruited. Whole blood was withdrawn from a peripheral vein of each subject. HIV RNA were extracted from plasma, and subjected to PCR amplification targeting HIV pol gene fragment and DNA sequencing. Sequences obtained were subtyped by phylogenetic analysis. Two subtypes, CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC, were found in subjects from Liuzhou, accounting for 75.2% and 24.8%, respectively. Subtype CRF01 AE, CRFO8_BC, B, and C were found in subjects from Nanning. CRF01_AE and CRF08 BC were still the dominant strains in Nanning, accounting for 85.8% and 11.5%, respectively. Sequences were also analyzed for drug resistance mutations, and rates of drug resistance were calculated. The rate of drug resistance was 3.3% in ART-naive subjects from Liuzhou, and 8.7% in the ART-experienced. For patients from Nanning, the rate was 1.4% in ART-naive subjects, and 27.5% in ART-experienced subjects.
