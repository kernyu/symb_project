Much of our understanding on resistance mechanisms to conventional cancer therapies such as chemotherapy and radiation has focused on cell intrinsic properties that antagonize the detrimental effects of DNA and other cellular damage. However, it is becoming clear that the immune system and/or innate immune signaling pathways can integrate with these intrinsic mechanisms to profoundly influence treatment efficacy. In this context, recent evidence indicates that interferon (IFN) signaling has an important role in this integration by influencing immune and intrinsic/non-immune determinants of therapy response. However, IFN signaling can be both immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive, and the factors determining these outcomes in different disease settings are unclear. Here I discuss the regulation and molecular events in cancer that are associated with these dichotomous functions.
