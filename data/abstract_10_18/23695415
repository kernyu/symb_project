The late Professor Leo Vining began his antibiotics research career as a visiting scientist in the laboratory of Selman Waksman at Rutgers University during the golden age of antibiotics. Through six decades of his distinguished career, Vining explored the biosynthesis of dozens of antibacterial and antifungal compounds produced by microorganisms. A number of underlying mechanisms of antibiotic biosynthesis were unraveled through his holistic approach and the findings laid the foundation to our understanding of regulation of antibiotic biosynthesis. In this paper, we reflect on Professor Vining's antibiotic research philosophy from a personal perspective and connect this philosophy to new approaches for rapid development of the next generation of antibiotics, which is urgently needed to combat the threat of escalating antimicrobial resistance. Facing the urgency, The Infectious Disease Society of America launched 'The 10 x '20 Initiative' in 2010 and called for a global commitment to develop 10 new, safe and effective antibiotics by the year 2020.(1.)
