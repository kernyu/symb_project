The impact of broad-spectrum antibiotics on antimicrobial resistance and disruption of the beneficial microbiome compels the urgent investigation of bacteria-specific approaches such as antibody-based strategies. Among these, DNA-delivered monoclonal antibodies (DMAbs), produced by muscle cells in vivo, potentially allow the prevention or treatment of bacterial infections circumventing some of the hurdles of protein IgG delivery. Here, we optimize DNA-delivered monoclonal antibodies consisting of two potent human IgG clones, including a non-natural bispecific IgG1 candidate, targeting Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The DNA-delivered monoclonal antibodies exhibit indistinguishable potency compared to bioprocessed IgG and protect against lethal pneumonia in mice. The DNA-delivered monoclonal antibodies decrease bacterial colonization of organs and exhibit enhanced adjunctive activity in combination with antibiotics. These studies support DNA-delivered monoclonal antibodies delivery as a potential strategy to augment the host immune response to prevent serious bacterial infections, and represent a significant advancement toward broader practical delivery of monoclonal antibody immunotherapeutics for additional infectious pathogens.DNA-delivered monoclonal antibodies (DMAbs) can be produced by muscle cells in vivo, potentially allowing prevention or treatment of infectious diseases. Here, the authors show that two DMAbs targeting Pseudomonas aeruginosa proteins confer protection against lethal pneumonia in mice.
