Objectives: ESBL genes in Escherichia coli are mainly plasmid encoded, although recent studies have also shown chromosomal integration, e.g. in clinical E. coli isolates of ST38. As ESBL-producing E. coli are also found in non-clinical settings, we were interested in determining whether chromosomally integrated ESBL genes occur in ST38 isolates from non-clinical habitats, e.g. wildlife. Methods: Four ESBL-producing E. coli isolates of ST38 originating from Mongolian birds of prey sampled in 2015 were subjected to a detailed analysis in terms of phenotypic resistance, plasmid profiling and WGS, followed by the determination of genotypic resistance factors including the chromosomal integration of ESBL and carbapenemase genes. Results: Results based on phenotypic and genotypic plasmid profiling, contiguous sequence (contig) sizes and PCR analysis of flanking insertion site regions showed that three of four ST38 isolates harboured chromosomally encoded bla CTX-M genes of three different types ( bla CTX-M-14 , bla CTX-M-15 and bla CTX-M-24 ) that were inserted into three different chromosomal locations. A comparison of WGS data with ST38 isolates from a clinical outbreak in the UK indicated only low numbers of core-genome SNPs detected among one Mongolian wild bird isolate and eight clinical isolates from the UK. Conclusions: The chromosomal integration of bla CTX-M genes in E. coli isolates of ST38 appears to be common and is likely independent of antimicrobial selective pressure in clinical environments. Our data corroborate the zoonotic potential of environmental isolates of ESBL-producing E. coli , which harbour stably integrated, chromosomally encoded resistance factors.
