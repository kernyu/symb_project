BACKGROUND: Nosocomial infection due to multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens in intensive care units is a challenge for clinicians and microbiologists, and has led to resurgence of parenteral colistin use in the last decade. Safety and efficacy data regarding intravenous colistin (colistimethate) use in neonates is sparse. We present our experience of efficacy and safety of colistimethate in the treatment of sepsis in critically sick term and preterm neonates. METHODS: The records of the neonates who received colistimethate in a neonatal intensive care unit of a tertiary care center from January 2009 to December 2009 were reviewed. RESULTS: Eighteen critically sick neonates (10 term and 8 preterm) received 21 courses of colistimethate (dose ranging from 50,000 to 75,000 IU/kg/d) for treatment of pneumonia, blood stream infections, meningitis, and empyema thoracis. The isolated pathogens in decreasing order of frequency were Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonos aeruginosa, and Enterobacter. Mean duration of colistimethate was 13.1 days/course (range: 5-21 days). At least one other antibiotic was coadministered in all courses. A favorable clinical outcome occurred in 16 of 21 (76%) courses, 5 patients died due to severe sepsis with multiple organ dysfunction. Microbiologic clearance was documented in 17 courses. Increase in serum creatinine by > 0.5 mg/dL above baseline in 2 babies was associated with the presence of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in both and coadministration of netilmicin in one. CONCLUSIONS: Colistimethate intravenous administration appears to be safe and efficacious for multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections in neonates, including preterm and extremely low birth weight neonates.
