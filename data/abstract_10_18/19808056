Antiretroviral drug resistance is a fundamental survival strategy for the virus that stems from its vast capacity to generate diversity. With the recent availability of new ARV drugs and classes, it is now possible to prescribe fully active ART to most HIV-infected subjects and achieve viral suppression even in those with multidrug-resistant HIV. It is uncertain, however, if this scenario will endure. Given that ART must be given for life, and new compounds other than second-generation integrase inhibitors may not reach the clinic soon, all efforts must be done to avoid the development of resistance to the new agents. Here, we discuss relevant aspects for the clinical management of antiretroviral drug resistance, leaving detailed explanations of mechanisms and mutation patterns to other articles in this issue. This article forms part of a special issue of Antiviral Research marking the 25th anniversary of antiretroviral drug discovery and development, vol. 85, issue 1, 2010.
