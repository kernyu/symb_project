The tripartite efflux pump MacAB-TolC found in gram-negative bacteria is involved in resistance to antibiotics. We previously reported the funnel-like hexameric structure of the adaptor protein MacA to be physiologically relevant. In this study, we investigated the role of the tip region of its alpha-hairpin, which forms a cogwheel structure in the funnel-like shape of the MacA hexamer. Mutational and biochemical analyses revealed that the conserved residues located at the tip region of the alpha-hairpin of MacA play an essential role in the binding of TolC. Our findings offer a molecular basis for understanding the drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria.
