OBJECTIVES: A 2',3'-cyclic phosphodiesterase gene (drCPDase) has been characterized from Deinococcus radiodurans and is involved in the robust resistance of this organism. RESULTS: Cells lacking 2',3'-cyclic phosphodiesterase gene (drCPDase) showed modest growth defects and displayed increased sensitivities to high doses of various DNA-damaging agents including ionizing radiation, mitomycin C, UV and H2O2. The transcriptional level of drCPDase increased after H2O2 treatment. Additional nucleotide monophosphate partially recovered the phenotype of drCPDase knockout cells. Complementation of E. coli with drCPDase resulted in enhanced H2O2 resistance. CONCLUSIONS: The 2',3'-cyclic phosphodiesterase (drCPDase) contributes to the extreme resistance of D. radiodurans and is presumably involved in damaged nucleotide detoxification.
