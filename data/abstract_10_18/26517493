INTRODUCTION: Salmonella is a major cause of foodborne disease, and poultry products are important contributors to the transmission of this zoonotic pathogen. Although considered to be rare in most countries, Salmonella Corvallis has been reported in specific geographic areas isolated from both human and non-human sources. The aim of this study was to report the occurrence, the antimicrobial resistance profiles including the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production, and the clonal relatedness of S. Corvallis strains. METHODOLOGY: A total of 132 fragments of poultry carcasses from a slaughterhouse in Sao Paulo State, Brazil, were collected at different stages of the manufacturing process (post-bleeding, post-plucking, and post-chilling) and analyzed for the presence of Salmonella. Antimicrobial resistance was determined by disc diffusion method and Etest. Clonal relatedness was determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). RESULTS: Among the 272 Salmonella strains recovered, fourteen were S. Corvallis. Ten (71.4%) showed ESBL production and resistance to at least three antimicrobial agents. Nalidixic acid resistance and reduced ciprofloxacin susceptibility was verified in four (28.6%) strains. PFGE analyses showed that all the S. Corvallis strains belonged to the same pulsotype. CONCLUSION: This study identified genetically related S. Corvallis strains exhibiting ESBL production and reduced susceptibility to quinolone. The results suggest the need to improve the sanitary conditions in the slaughterhouse. Moreover, from a public health perspective, continuous surveillance on Salmonella is needed to control the dissemination of this important zoonotic pathogen and its resistance determinants.
