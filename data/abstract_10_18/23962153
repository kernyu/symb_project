Almost all European countries are affected by the expansion of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae occurring during recent years. In the two hospitals of Verona, Italy, the incidence of carbapenem-nonsusceptible Klebsiella pneumoniae (CNSKP) began to increase by the first months of 2011, reached a peak in the summer of the same year, and currently is around 30%. Contrary to what was reported by other hospitals and although significant percentages of CNSKP were detected in respiratory samples, blood and pus, urine from hospitalized patients, mainly geriatrics, are the clinical samples with the highest incidence of these strains. Elder patients are frequently transferred from the hospital to their own homes or long-term care facilities and vice-versa. Moreover, urinary tract infections are not considered as a severe pathology and frequently is asymptomatic in elderly. For these reasons, the presence of carbapenem non-susceptible bacteria in the urinary tract of geriatric patients might be an underestimated cause of multiresistant strain spreading to the non-hospitalized population and the community.
