Scedosporium and Lomentospora species are the second most frequent colonizing, allergenic, or invasive fungal pathogens in patients with cystic fibrosis, and are responsible for infections varying from cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue infections caused by traumatic inoculation to severe systemic diseases in immunocompromised patients. The clinical relevance of fungal airway colonization for individual patients harboring Scedosporium and Lomentospora species is still an underestimated issue. The high resistance of Scedosporium and Lomentospora species to antifungal drugs has highlighted the need for alternative treatment modalities, and antimicrobial photodynamic therapy may be one such alternative. In this study, methylene blue was applied as a photosensitizing agent to 6 type strains of Scedosporium and Lomentospora species, and we irradiated the strains using a light-emitting diode (635 +/- 10 nm, 12 J/cm(2)). We evaluated the effects of photodynamic therapy on strain growth and on the in vitro susceptibility of the strains to itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, and amphotericin B. A colony-forming unit reduction of up to 5.2 log10 was achieved. Minimal inhibitory concentration ranges also decreased significantly with photoinactivation. Photodynamic therapy improved both the inactivation rates and the antifungal susceptibility profile of all fungal isolates tested.
