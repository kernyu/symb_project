BACKGROUND: Acquired tamoxifen resistance is a significant problem in estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. In a cellular model, tamoxifen resistance was associated with increased sensitivity towards toxic dicarbonyls and reduced free sulfhydryl group content. We here analyzed the role of oxidative stress and glyoxalase I activity on dicarbonyl resistance and the significance of glyoxalase I expression for survival. METHODS: Reactive oxygen species were determined by 2,7-dihydrochlorofluorescein diacetate. Inhibitors for NADPH-oxidase (diphenyleneiodonium), p38 MAPK (SB203580) and ERK1/2 (UO126) were applied to investigate interactions of these signaling molecules. N-acetyl cysteine was used to evaluate the effect of oxidative stress on cell viability, which was assessed by the resazurin assay. Gene expression was analyzed by real time qRT-PCR. Glyoxalase activity was inhibited by the specific inhibitor CS-0683 and siRNA. The relevance of glyoxalase 1 mRNA abundance on survival of breast cancer patients was evaluated by the KM-plotter web interface. RESULTS: alpha-Oxo-aldehydes caused an immediate increase in reactive oxygen species where the tamoxifen resistant cell line (TamR) responded at lower concentrations than the MCF-7 parental cell line. Inhibitor studies placed ROS production by NADPH-oxidase downstream of p38 MAPK. The antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) increased survival, whereas glyoxalase (GLO1) inhibition increased dicarbonyl toxicity. GLO1 mRNA abundance was correlated with unfavorable prognosis of breast cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: Dicarbonyl toxicity was mediated by oxidative stress and GLO1 activity determines aldehyde toxicity in tamoxifen resistant cells. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Glyoxalases might be predictive biomarkers for tamoxifen resistance and a putative target for the treatment of tamoxifen resistant breast cancer patients.
