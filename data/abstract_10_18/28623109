BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Reports on the efficacy of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) have been received from many countries. However, in countries where the 7-valent PCV (PCV7) and 13-valent PCV (PCV13) were introduced, overall coverage of the serotypes by the vaccine gradually decreased due to pneumococcal serotype replacement. The aim of this study is to assess the distribution of pneumococcal serotypes and to also provide basic data on adult respiratory infection in Japan. METHODS: We analyzed 1086 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains that had been isolated from respiratory tract infection specimens in adult patients from 2006 to 2014. Capsular typing was performed by the Quellung reaction and multiplex PCR. RESULTS: Among all 1086 strains, serotype 3 was the most common and was identified in 160 strains (14.7%), followed by serotypes 19F, 6B, 19A and 23F. From 2006-10 to 2012-14, the coverage rate of PCV7 tended to gradually decrease. Particularly, serotypes 6B and 19F of penicillin non-susceptible strains decreased. On the other hand, serotypes 19A and 15A of penicillin non-susceptible strains increased. However, coverage by PCV13 of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) (penicillin G minimum inhibitory concentration >/=2 mug/mL) remained high (88.7% [2006-10], 88.0% [2012-14]). CONCLUSIONS: In Japan, PCV13 vaccination of adults became available from June 2014. Our study demonstrated that most PRSP (88.0%) still remain covered by PCV13. At present, the introduction of PCV13 in adult clinical practice seems to be highly significant. However, there is a possibility that the distribution has been changing, and careful screening should be continued in the future.
