Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) have represented one of the most visible and effective classes of disinfectants for nearly a century. With simple preparation, wide structural variety, and versatile incorporation into consumer products, there have been manifold developments and applications of these structures. Generally operating via disruption of one of the most fundamental structures in bacteria-the cell membrane-leading to cell lysis and bacterial death, the QACs were once thought to be impervious to resistance. Developments over the past decades, however, have shown this to be far from the truth. It is now known that a large family of bacterial genes (generally termed qac genes) encode efflux pumps capable of expelling many QAC structures from bacterial cells, leading to a decrease in susceptibility to QACs; methods of regulation of qac transcription are also understood. Importantly, qac genes can be horizontally transferred via plasmids to other bacteria and are often transmitted alongside other antibiotic-resistant genes; this dual threat represents a significant danger to human health. In this review, both QAC development and QAC resistance are documented, and possible strategies for addressing and overcoming QAC-resistant bacteria are discussed.
