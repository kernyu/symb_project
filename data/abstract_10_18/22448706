The aim of our study was to assess epidemiological features of neonatal invasive candidiasis in Farhat Hached hospital of Sousse, Tunisia, including incidence, risk factors, mortality, species distribution and antifungal susceptibility. Laboratory data from 1995 to 2010 and medical records of 127 invasive candidiasis cases were reviewed. We tested the susceptibility of 100 Candida sp isolates by using ATB fungus((R)) 3 and to fluconazole by using E-test((R)) strips. A total of 252 cases of neonatal invasive candidiasis occurred over the study period. The incidence increased 1.8-fold from 1995 to 2006 and decreased fourfold from 2007 to 2010. Candida albicans was the predominant species up to 2006 and a shift in the species spectrum was observed with increase of the non-albicans species mainly C. parapsilosis. The agreement between the ATB Fungus((R)) and the E-test((R)) for determining fluconazole susceptibility was high. All tested isolates were susceptible to fluconazole, flucytosine, amphotericine B and voriconazole and the itraconazole resistance rate was 5%. The mortality rate was 63%. The invasive candidiasis incidence increased from 1995 to 2006 and decreased from 2007 to 2010. The spectrum of Candida species and the lack of fluconazole-resistant strains argue for the usefulness of fluconazole as an empiric treatment.
