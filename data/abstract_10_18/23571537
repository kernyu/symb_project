The activity of five novel gyrase inhibitors was evaluated against 303 nonduplicate Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains collected from 53 North American institutions. The most active compound, GP-2, displayed MIC(50) and MIC(90) values of 1 and 2 mug/ml, respectively. Cross-resistance to other commercially available antipseudomonal compounds was not evident, as no major change was observed in the gyrase inhibitor MIC distribution when stratified by nonsusceptible phenotypes, including the fluoroquinolones and those isolates classified as multidrug resistant (MDR).
