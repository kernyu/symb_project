This study is to evaluate the HAART pharmacodynamics with dolutegravir as the "anchor" in vitro. A nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) resistant recombinant virus model (VSVG/HIV-1(RT-D67N,K70R,T215F)) and an integrase inhibitors (INIs) resistant recombinant virus model (VSVG/HIV-1(IN-G140S,QI48H)) were constructed and established. The anti-viral pharmacodynamics was evaluated with drug combinations including two NRTIs along with one INI or one NNRTI. The results showed that the combination with an INI gave a stronger synergism on wild type HIV-1 replication comparing to that with an NNRTI. Comparing the two INIs as the "anchor" for HAART, DTG exhibited an equivalent CI to that of RAL on wild type HIV-1 replication; but a greater synergy than RAL on INI-resistant HIV-1 replication. Besides of the pharmacodynamics results of DTG-based drug combination, the results may contribute to clinical antiviral therapy.
