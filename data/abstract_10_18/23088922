Trichomonas vaginalis is a parasitic protozoan that causes sexually transmitted infections (STIs) worldwide. The infection is dangerous and easily spreads within a community. Also, some cases of drug resistance were reported. Previously, we reported that the shrimp anti-lipopolysaccharide factor (SALF), an antimicrobial peptide of 24 amino acids, modulates inflammatory responses and inhibits T. vaginalis growth. To date, there is no report on the mechanism of SALF's actions in T. vaginalis' adherence to HeLa cells. In this research using an ELISA, we found that the SALF downregulated the release of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-6, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1) secreted by T. vaginalis which was adhering to HeLa cells. We also performed real-time PCR experiments to determine the roles of the SALF in the expressions of several proinflammatory genes. Through a Western blot analysis, we determined that SALF treatment inhibited T. vaginalis-treated HeLa cells through the p38 and NF-kappaB pathways. Furthermore, we used different inhibitors to confirm the pathway by ELISA and Western blotting. Taken together, it is apparent that the SALF suppresses T. vaginalis-induced secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by HeLa cells by acting through the p38 and NF-kappaB pathways.
