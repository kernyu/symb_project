The in vitro activity of the novel antimicrobial peptide dendrimer G3KL was evaluated against 32 Acinetobacter baumannii (including 10 OXA-23, 7 OXA-24, and 11 OXA-58 carbapenemase producers) and 35 Pseudomonas aeruginosa (including 18 VIM and 3 IMP carbapenemase producers) strains and compared to the activities of standard antibiotics. Overall, both species collections showed MIC50/90 values of 8/8 mug/ml and minimum bactericidal concentrations at which 50% or 90% of strains tested are killed (MBC50/90) of 8/8 mug/ml. G3KL is a promising molecule with antibacterial activity against multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa isolates.
