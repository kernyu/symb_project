In a sub-district level hospital in South India, the proportion of patients with abnormal chest X-ray (CXR) was evaluated among smear-negative, Xpert(R) MTB/RIF (Xpert) positive individuals with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) symptoms; 384 smear-negative PTB individuals with PTB symptoms and without a history of anti-tuberculosis treatment underwent CXR and Xpert testing of one sputum specimen. Of 378 individuals with both Xpert and CXR results available, 14 were positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Of these, 13 (92.9%) had an abnormal CXR and one was normal. This study highlights the usefulness of CXR before Xpert testing, which needs further validation.
