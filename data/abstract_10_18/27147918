OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine antimicrobial resistance of Escherichia coli strains isolated from urine in outpatient population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study for tree months period, between January 1(st) and March 31(st), 2015, at the Department of Microbiology and Parasitology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Sarajevo. We determined the E. coli antimicrobial resistance in 556 first urine samples from outpatient population of Hrasno community in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. E. coli is the most frequent agent causing urinary tract infections in outpatients as well. The standard methods of descriptive statistics were performed for data analysis. RESULTS: We observed the highest antimicrobial resistance of E. coli for ampicillin (82,79%), followed by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (40,86%), nalidixic acid (19,35%), cephazolin (7,52%), nitrofurantoin (5,37%), gentamicin (2,15%) and ciprofloxacin (4,30%). CONCLUSIONS: The results of study showed that E. coli has the highest resistance to ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in outpatient population of Hrasno community.
