BACKGROUND: Nowadays, the global spread of resistance to oxyimino-cephalosporins in Enterobacteriaceae implies the need for novel diagnostics that can rapidly target resistant organisms from these bacterial species. METHODS: In this study, we developed and evaluated a Direct Mass Spectrometry assay for Beta-Lactamase (D-MSBL) that allows direct identification of (oxyimino)cephalosporin-resistant Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae from positive blood cultures (BCs), by using the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) technology. RESULTS: The D-MSBL assay was performed on 93 E. coli or K. pneumoniae growing BC samples that were shortly co-incubated with cefotaxime (CTX) as the indicator cephalosporin. Susceptibility and resistance defining peaks from the samples' mass spectra were analyzed by a novel algorithm for bacterial organism classification. The D-MSBL assay allowed discrimination between E. coli and K. pneumoniae that were resistant or susceptible to CTX with a sensitivity of 86.8% and a specificity of 98.2%. CONCLUSION: The proposed algorithm-based D-MSBL assay, if integrated in the routine laboratory diagnostic workflow, may be useful to enhance the establishment of appropriate antibiotic therapy and to control the threat of oxyimino-cephalosporin resistance in hospital.
