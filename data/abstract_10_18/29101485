Recently, the mortality of life-threatening fungal infections increased dramatically. However, there are few antifungals existed. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as promising antifungal candidates have attracted much attention. Here, we present a small antimicrobial peptide Jelleine-I that had potent in vitro and in vivo antifungal activity. Negligible hemolytic activity and in vivo toxicity were observed. Selectivity index (SI) of Jelleine-I is at least 4.6 times higher than amphotericin B. Jelleine-I could increase the production of cellular ROS and bind with genome DNA. This may contribute to its antifungal activity. Furthermore, drug resistance is not induced when the fungal cells were repeatedly treated by Jelleine-I. In conclusion, our results suggest that Jelleine-I may have the potential to be developed as a novel antifungal agent.
