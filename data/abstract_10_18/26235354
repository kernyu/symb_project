Overexpression of ATP-dependent efflux pump P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is the main cause of multidrug resistance (MDR) and chemotherapy failure in cancer treatment. Inhibition of P-gp-mediated drug efflux is an effective way to overcome cancer drug resistance. The present study investigated the reversal effect of the novel tetrandrine derivative W6 on P-gp-mediated MDR. KBv200, MCF-7/adr and their parental sensitive cell lines KB, MCF-7 were used for reversal study. The intracellular accumulation with P-gp substrates of doxorubicin was determined by flow cytometry. The expression of P-gp and ERK1/2 was investigated by western blot and real-time-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis. ATPase activity of P-gp was performed by P-gp-Glo(TM) assay systems. In comparison with P-gp-negative parental cells, W6 produced a favorable reversal effect in the MDR cells, as determined using the MTT assay. W6 significantly and dose-dependently increased intracellular accumulation of P-gp substrate doxorubicin (DOX) in P-gp overexpressing KBv200 cells, and also inhibited the ATPase activity of P-gp. W6 inhibited P-gp expression in KBv200 cells in a time-dependent manner, but it had no effect on MDR1 expression. In addition, W6 significantly decreased the ERK1/2 activation in KBv200 cells. Our results showed that W6 effectively reversed P-gp-mediated MDR by inhibiting the transport function and expression of P-gp, demonstrating the potential clinical utility of W6.
