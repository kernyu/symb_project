Candida tropicalis has been associated with invasive candidiasis, being the first or second most common non-Candida albicans Candida species isolated in humans with candidemia and candiduria, as well as being frequently isolated from healthy animals. This study aimed to characterize C. tropicalis isolates (n = 64) obtained from several animal species regarding antifungal susceptibility and production of virulence factors. The isolates were obtained from the microbiota of healthy animals (goats, n = 25; sheep, n = 6; psittacines, n = 14; rheas, n = 6; horses, n = 2; sirenians, n = 5; shrimp, n = 1), as well as from aquatic mammals found dead in the environment (cetaceans, n = 5). The isolates were subjected to in vitro susceptibility testing by broth microdilution according to the CLSI M27-A3 protocol against amphotericin B, caspofungin, itraconazole, and fluconazole. We also evaluated the virulence attributes, such as proteases and phospholipases, as well as biofilm formation. Resistance to itraconazole (n = 29) and fluconazole (n = 30) was detected among isolates from every source; resistance to both azoles was detected in 24 isolates, but none of them were resistant to amphotericin B and caspofungin. Protease production was detected in the majority of the isolates (n = 59), but phospholipase was produced by only a few of them (n = 6). The isolates showed different patterns in biofilm production, being considered strong producers (n = 41), moderate producers (n = 11), weak producers (n = 9) or non-producers (n = 3). In summary, C. tropicalis isolated from animals showed high rate of resistance to azoles, expressed virulence factors and therefore may represent a potential threat to human and animal health.
