BACKGROUND: Over the last two decades, Candida blood stream infections (BSIs) have been increasingly reported from various parts of the world. Recent studies on invasive candidiasis have documented the emergence of non albicans Candida (NAC) species as major pathogens. Candida spp. belonging to NAC group often demonstrate intrinsic or acquired or both resistance to fluconazole which is the most readily available and prescribed cost effective antifungal agent. Echinocandins are recent addition to antifungal armamentarium and are now increasingly used as first line drugs for treatment and management of candidemia. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine echinocandin susceptibility profile of fluconazole resistant Candida Spp. isolated from BSIs. RESULTS: Predominance of NAC spp was noted. C. glabrata followed by C. krusei and C. parapsilosis demonstrated high resistance to fluconazole. Echinocandins demonstrated good activity against all Candida spp. CONCLUSION: As species distribution of Candida isolates varies greatly by country and by different health care setups within the country, species identification and antifungal susceptibility results are often useful to guide the selection of empiric treatment and design of local therapeutic guidelines. On the basis of antifungal susceptibility profile of the isolates, caspofungin can be suggested as a useful antifungal drug for the treatment of candidemia due to fluconazole resistant species.
