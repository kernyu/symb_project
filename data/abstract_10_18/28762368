BACKGROUND: Non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli (NFGNB) have emerged as a major cause of healthcare-associated infections and are innately resistant to many antibiotics. AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of NFGNB isolated from various clinical specimens and evaluate their antimicrobial susceptibility profiles. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was done at our Department of Microbiology from December 2015 to December 2016. NFGNB were isolated from a variety of clinical specimens, plated on blood agar and MacConkey agar and incubated at 37 degrees C for 18-24 h under aerobic conditions. Appropriate biochemical tests were done to identify the organisms isolated. Antibiotic susceptibility test was performed using the modified Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method using commercially available discs on Mueller-Hinton agar. Data was analyzed using SPSS IBM version 20. RESULTS: Out of 19065 clinical samples, cultures were positive in 1854 samples. Out of 1854 culture-positive samples, 216 (11.6%) yielded NFGNB. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common NFGNB, isolated in 190/216 (87.96%) samples, followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (17/216, 7.87%). Overall, most of the NFGNB isolates were susceptible to polymyxin B (88.4%), imipenem (82.9%) and cefoperazone + sulbactam (50.9%), and a total of 11 (64.71%) multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (MDRAB) strains were isolated in the study. CONCLUSION: Our study showed a significantly high prevalence of NFGNB. Isolation of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa and MDRAB in the present study raises the concern of rapidly emerging antibiotic resistance in this group of bacteria in our region.
