BACKGROUND: The Orthopoxvirus genus contains numerous virus species that are capable of causing disease in humans, including variola virus (the etiological agent of smallpox), monkeypox virus, cowpox virus, and vaccinia virus (the prototypical member of the genus). Monkeypox is a zoonotic disease that is endemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and is characterized by systemic lesion development and prominent lymphadenopathy. Like variola virus, monkeypox virus is a high priority pathogen for therapeutic development due to its potential to cause serious disease with significant health impacts after zoonotic, accidental, or deliberate introduction into a naive population. RESULTS: The purpose of this study was to investigate the prophylactic and therapeutic potential of interferon-beta (IFN-beta) for use against monkeypox virus. We found that treatment with human IFN-beta results in a significant decrease in monkeypox virus production and spread in vitro. IFN-beta substantially inhibited monkeypox virus when introduced 6-8 h post infection, revealing its potential for use as a therapeutic. IFN-beta induced the expression of the antiviral protein MxA in infected cells, and constitutive expression of MxA was shown to inhibit monkeypox virus infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the successful inhibition of monkeypox virus using human IFN-beta and suggest that IFN-beta could potentially serve as a novel safe therapeutic for human monkeypox disease.
