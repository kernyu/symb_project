Nucleotide sequencing of the fusB-flanking regions in two fusidic acid-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates with the type IV aj1-leader peptide (LP)-fusB structure (lacking aj1) revealed that their fusB gene was located on novel phage-related islands inserted downstream of smpB and are here referred to as SeRIfusB-3692 and SePIfusB-857. The novel SePIfusB-857 structure was followed by SeCI857, forming a composite pathogenicity island which contained a putative virulence gene, vapE. The linkage of fusB and vapE may contribute to bacterial adaption.
