Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection remains a major global problem but the recent advances in molecular methods have revolutionized the diagnosis and management of CHB. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA quantitation is the most useful molecular marker for the diagnosis and management of CHB. There is increasing evidence that the clinical outcome and efficacy of antiviral therapy for CHB could vary with the infecting HBV genotype, core promoter and precore mutations. Early identification of drug resistance is imperative in the management of CHB. The molecular methods for HBV DNA quantitation, HBV genotyping, the identification of mutants, genotypic and phenotypic methods for monitoring drug resistance and their utility and limitations for use in the diagnosis and monitoring of CHB are discussed in this article.
