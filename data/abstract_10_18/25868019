SETTING: After several changes in treatment modalities, it is time to re-evaluate treatment outcomes of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate treatment outcomes, elucidate changes in outcomes over time and identify predictors of treatment success for MDR-TB. DESIGN: Patients diagnosed with MDR-TB at a tertiary referral centre in South Korea between January 2006 and December 2010 were included. Treatment modalities and outcomes were assessed. Predictors of treatment success were analysed using multiple logistic regression. The treatment modalities and outcomes of these patients were compared with those of MDR-TB patients between January 1996 and December 2005. RESULTS: Of the 123 MDR-TB patients diagnosed during the later study period, treatment was successful in 103 (83.7%). Extensive drug resistance (OR 0.31, P = 0.044) and additional resistance to fluoroquinolones (OR 0.23, P = 0.039) were inversely associated with treatment success. The treatment success rate improved from 53.5% in 1996-2000 to 68.8% in 2001-2005 and 83.7% in 2006-2010 (P < 0.001). Improved outcomes were accompanied with more frequent use of later-generation fluoroquinolones and linezolid and less frequent surgical resection. CONCLUSION: Treatment outcomes for MDR-TB improved at a tertiary referral centre in South Korea. The improvement was associated with more frequent use of later-generation fluoroquinolones and linezolid.
