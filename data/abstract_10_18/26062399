The virally encoded protease is an important drug target for AIDS therapy. Despite the potency of the current drugs, infections with resistant viral strains limit the long-term effectiveness of therapy. Highly resistant variants of HIV protease from clinical isolates have different combinations of about 20 mutations and several orders of magnitude worse binding affinity for clinical inhibitors. Strategies are being explored to inhibit these highly resistant mutants. The existing inhibitors can be modified by introducing groups with the potential to form new interactions with conserved protease residues, and the flexible flaps. Alternative strategies are discussed, including designing inhibitors to bind to the open conformation of the protease dimer, and inhibition of the protease-catalyzed processing of the Gag-Pol precursor.
