The aim of the study was to examine the In vitro susceptibility of clinical isolates of respiratory pathogens to clofoctol compared with amoxicillin and erythromycin, and to characterize the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships of clofoctol using a murine pneumonia infection model. Strains clinically isolated from patients between 2005 and 2009 were used to examine susceptibility: penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and Haemophilus influenzae. The In vitro activity of clofoctol against clinical isolates has essentially remained unchanged over recent years. The MIC(5)(0) and MIC(9)(0) of clofoctol against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae are lower than that of amoxicillin and erythromycin. The area under curve/minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) ratio is the PK/PD parameter that best correlates with in vivo clofoctol efficacy; the value of AUC/MIC required to achieve the maximum effect in this study was 75.5.
