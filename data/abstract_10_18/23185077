Plasmodium falciparum resistance to the primary drugs used for treatment of malaria has become the main obstacle to malaria control. Artemisinin combination therapies are the current treatment strategy, and it has been suggested that resistance to artemisinin derivatives may be related to mutations in the Plasmodium falciparum sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase ortholog of the mammalian sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase gene, known as the pfatp6 gene. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in pfatp6. The presence of different SNPs was detected by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the pfatp6 gene, and then sequencing to identify all possible alleles of the gene. A total of 20 SNPs were detected, including eight SNPs that have not been previously described: K481R in Malabo; R801H on Annobon Island; and the synonymous SNPs a141t, c1788t, a2211g, t2739g, a2760c, and g2836a. The genotypic profile of pfatp6 in samples from Equatorial Guinea, may be a useful epidemiologic tool for monitoring local efficacy of artemisinin combination therapies.
