Lactococcus lactis H61 can increase the cellular immune responses of aged (14-mo-old) senescence-accelerated mice. The aim of this study was to investigate the factors contributing to IL-12 induction by strain H61 by analyzing strains derived from it. Strain H61 derivative no. 13 was obtained by growing the parent strain at 37 degrees C. This derivative induced significantly lower production of IL-12 from J774.1 macrophage cells than did the parent strain H61. The 2 strains differed in the resistance of their whole cells or cell walls to lysozyme, a cell wall-degrading enzyme. Sodium hydroxide treatment to de-O-acetylate muramic acid in the cell walls of the 2 strains reduced the lysozyme resistance, compared with untreated cell walls: at 3h after adding lysozyme, the lysozyme resistance of untreated and NaOH treated cell wall from strain H61 was 55.4% and 11.7%, respectively. The values of untreated and NaOH-treated cell walls from strain no.13 were 73.7 and 42.8%, respectively. The reduction was higher in strain H61, indicating that the cell walls of strain H61 were highly O-acetylated. Trichloroacetic acid treatment to remove wall-associated polymers such as teichoic acids made the lysozyme resistance of the cell walls of both strains similar. The sugar content of cell walls prepared from strain H61 was significantly higher than that of strain no. 13 cell wall. A derivative with less activity for inducing IL-12 by macrophage cells had less O-acetylation and had lower sugar content in the cell wall than did strain H61. Modifying the cell wall of strain H61 may be a useful way to regulate its ability to induce IL-12. Strain H61 has been used as a starter bacterium in the dairy industry. This study could lead to enhancing the value of dairy products made by strain H61 by characterizing the key factor(s) responsible for its stimulation of immunity.
