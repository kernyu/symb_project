PURPOSE: The emerging role of Toll-like receptors (TLR) in the pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) led us to ask whether TLR stimulation may protect CLL cells from drug-induced apoptosis. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We cultured in vitro malignant B cells freshly isolated from 44 patients with CLLs in the presence or the absence of different concentrations of fludarabine before or after 24-hour TLR stimulation with specific ligands and evaluated cell viability, apoptosis, and molecular pathways involved. RESULTS: Heterogeneity was observed among samples. In leukemic cells from patients bearing adverse prognostic factors, TLR stimulation caused a significant increase of protection to fludarabine treatment, whereas this did not occur in the cells from patients with good prognosis. To identify novel molecular mechanisms accounting for the dichotomy of response between the two groups of patients, we conducted an apoptosis gene expression profile on leukemic cells either unstimulated or stimulated with TLR9 ligand. Strikingly, TLR9 stimulation specifically upregulated the expression of lymphotoxin-alpha in cells where an increased protection to fludarabine treatment was observed. Also, the expression of miR-155-3p was significantly increased after stimulation of distinct TLR in cells where fludarabine treatment was less effective. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that at least in a proportion of patients, in vitro sensitivity to fludarabine may be modulated by the stimulation of TLR, likely mimicking microenvironmental signals occurring in vivo.
