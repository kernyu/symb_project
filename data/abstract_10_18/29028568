Arcobacter butzleri is an emerging pathogen isolated from animals, food and the environment. In this study, 147 A. butzleri isolated from seafood and the coastal environment were tested for the presence of ten putative virulence genes (cadF, cj1349, ciaB, mviN, pldA, tlyA, hecA, hecB, irgA, iroE) and antimicrobial susceptibilities. Majority of the isolates harbored mviN (100%), cj1349 (97.2%), ciaB (95.9%), tlyA (91.8%), pldA (91.1%) and cadF (89.7%). Lower detection rates were observed for hecA (10.8%), hecB (19%), iroE (12.9%) and irgA (17.6%). Three A. butzleri isolates harbored all ten virulence genes. The occurrence of cj1349, ciaB, pldA, tlyA and hecA genes was significantly different (P</=0.05) among the isolates from different sources. All (100%) A. butzleri isolates were resistant to vancomycin, cephalothin, cefoxitin and sulphamethizole and susceptible to polymyxin-B, kanamycin, streptomycin, gentamicin, tetracycline and imipenem. Resistance to clinically important antibiotics such as cefotaxime (99.3%), ceftazidime (87.7%), nalidixic acid (70.7%), ampicillin (72.1%), ertapenem and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (41.9%) was observed in A. butzleri from the environment. The isolates were highly susceptible to norfloxacin (97.9%) and colistin (97.2%), followed by ciprofloxacin (88.4%), meropenem (74.8%), chloramphenicol (72.7%) and erythromycin (69.3%). A. butzleri from different sources were not significantly different with respect to their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. Multidrug resistance was observed in 66 (81.4%) isolates from fish, 29 (72.5%) isolates from shellfish and 17 (65.3%) isolates from coastal water. A. butzleri harboring virulence genes and resistance to multiple antibiotics found in seafood could be a potential health risk to seafood handlers and consumers. Continuous monitoring of seafood for potentially pathogenic A. butzleri is important to understand the evolution of antibiotic resistance in this emerging food pathogen and to determine the antimicrobial therapy regimen in the event of food-borne A. butzleri infections.
