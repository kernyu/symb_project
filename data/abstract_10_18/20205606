IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Standard triple therapy (STT) is the most used treatment for Helicobater pylori infection. The prevalence of antibiotic resistance has increased substantially in recent years and there has been a corresponding decrease in efficacy. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: Bibliographical searches were performed in MEDLINE and international congresses up to 2009 for 'Helicobacter pylori' AND 'sequential regimen/therapy'. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: Several meta-analyses have demonstrated that sequential therapy (SQT) is more effective than STT. SQT is not affected by bacterial and host factors that have, until now, predicted the outcome of STT. Primary clarithromycin resistance is the only factor reducing the efficacy of SQT; however, even in these patients an acceptable > 75% eradication can be achieved. So far, almost all the studies have been performed in Italy. The advantages of SQT over STT should be confirmed in different countries. Whether it is necessary to provide the drugs sequentially or if the four components of SQT can be given concurrently is unclear. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: SQT is a promising new treatment approach that deserves consideration as a treatment strategy for H. pylori infection. However, further robust assessment across a much broader range of patients is required before SQT could supplant existing treatment regimens and be generally recommended in clinical practice.
