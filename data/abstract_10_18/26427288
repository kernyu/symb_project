Antibiotic resistance in Gram-positive bacteria already has a significant impact on morbidity and mortality. The situation is particularly alarming in the case of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and glycopeptide-resistant Enterococcus faecium, which have shown an ability to spread to new ecological niches and to generate new clones with both increased drug resistance and increased virulence. The potential for genetic exchanges between these two species raises the specter of highly resistant and virulent S. aureus strains.
