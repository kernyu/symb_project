Candida auris is a newly identified species causing invasive candidemia and candidiasis. It has broad multidrug resistance (MDR) not observed for other pathogenic Candida species. Histatin 5 (Hst 5) is a well-studied salivary cationic peptide with significant antifungal activity against Candida albicans and is an attractive candidate for treating MDR fungi, since antimicrobial peptides induce minimal drug resistance. We investigated the susceptibility of C. auris to Hst 5 and neutrophils, two first-line innate defenses in the human host. The majority of C. auris clinical isolates, including fluconazole-resistant strains, were highly sensitive to Hst 5: 55 to 90% of cells were killed by use of 7.5 muM Hst 5. Hst 5 was translocated to the cytosol and vacuole in C. auris cells; such translocation is required for the killing of C. albicans by Hst 5. The inverse relationship between fluconazole resistance and Hst 5 killing suggests different cellular targets for Hst 5 than for fluconazole. C. auris showed higher tolerance to oxidative stress than C. albicans, and higher survival within neutrophils, which correlated with resistance to oxidative stress in vitro Thus, resistance to reactive oxygen species (ROS) is likely one, though not the only, important factor in the killing of C. auris by neutrophils. Hst 5 has broad and potent candidacidal activity, enabling it to combat MDR C. auris strains effectively.
