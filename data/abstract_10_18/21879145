Six cases of bacteremia and one of endarteritis were identified between 1986 and 2010 in a general hospital in Chile. Five of these cases occurred during the second half of this timeframe, Campylobacter fetus predominated (5 out of 7) and the majority of the infections presented during warmer months. The mean age was 32.4 years (range 19 to 63) all had comorbidities, and main clinical manifestations included fever with diarrhea. Four patients developed hypotension and two septic shock. The latter, associated to C. fetus bacteremia, died before microbiological diagnosis. Six out of 7 patients received antimicrobial therapy. During 2004 and 2010, the rates of Campylobacter spp. positive stool cultures in the same hospital increased 4 times, suggesting an emerging profile. Bacteremia and endarteritis by Campylobacter spp. can develop in vulnerable patients and manifest as fever with or without diarrhea. Finding curved or spiral shaped gram negative rods in blood cultures leads to suspect this pathogen. Species identification is of utmost importance due to antimicrobial resistance especially in C. jejuni. Prognosis is unfavorable due to host characteristics, and case-fatality rate is high.
