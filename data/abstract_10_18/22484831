Paecilomyces lilacinus infection is rare and is found worldwide. The majority of infections occur in immunocompromised people. Among immunocompetent patients, cutaneous infections are the second most common site of infection but are difficult to treat because of antifungal resistance. We report a case of hand cutaneous involvement with synovitis in an immunocompetent patient that improved after treatment with oral voriconazole. To the best of our knowledge, there are only five published cases of cutaneous P.lilacinus infection, all in immunocompromised patient, treated with oral voriconazole. We review all previously reported cases.
