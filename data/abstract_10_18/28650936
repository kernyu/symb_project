Current evidence on the use of colistin in pediatric patients for infections caused by carbapenem-resistant bacteria is based on retrospective case series. The coadministration of colistin with other antimicrobial agents was associated with a relatively low rate of nephrotoxicity and a favorable outcome in >70% of these patients. Further study of colistin pharmacokinetics in children and neonates will likely lead to optimization of dosage recommendations.
