BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance has been increasing for several years and is often higher in intensive care units (ICUs) than in other facilities. The spread of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in particular has profoundly impacted antimicrobial efficacy and usage. The Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends has monitored the in vitro activity of ertapenem and several comparators against aerobic gram-negative bacteria from intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) for many years. This report summarizes susceptibility levels and epidemiology for key IAI pathogens cultured from general pediatric medical wards and pediatric ICUs globally. METHODS: 1248 gram-negative bacteria were collected from pediatric IAIs by 113 labs in 40 countries from 2008 to 2010. Susceptibility was determined by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute broth microdilution. Susceptibility rates (%S) were determined for species with >/=10 isolates. RESULTS: Sixty-two percent of isolates came from general pediatric wards and 38% from pediatric ICUs. The overall ESBL-positive rate was 11.0% for Escherichia coli and 38.9% for Klebsiella pneumoniae; the ESBL-positive rate for E. coli was twice as high in ICU as non-ICU. Most study drugs inhibited >90% of ESBL-negative isolates, but only the carbapenems inhibited >90% of ESBL-positive E. coli and only imipenem inhibited >90% of ESBL-positive K. pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: Amikacin, imipenem and ertapenem were the most active against gram-negative bacteria from pediatric IAIs, followed closely by the fluoroquinolones and cefepime. Other cephalosporins were often <90% active. ESBL rates were 38.9% for K. pneumoniae and 11.0% for E. coli. Therapy for pediatric IAIs should take into consideration local ESBL rates because only carbapenems inhibited most of these pathogens.
