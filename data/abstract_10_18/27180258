Case description To evaluate whether continuous intravenous (i.v.) administration of enfuvirtide (T20) could be a suitable alternative to subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of T20 in a patient with extensively drug-resistant HIV experiencing difficulties administering T20 subcutaneously. T20 was administered to a patient through 100 mL cassettes once daily via a CADD. Plasma samples were drawn and the pharmacokinetic profile compared to that of s.c. twice daily administration of T20. Also, viral replication and CD4+ count were monitored over a period of 9 months for this study. Continuous i.v. administration of T20 resulted in significantly higher T20 plasma levels compared to s.c. administration, continued viral suppression, a rise in CD4+ count and strong patient preference over s.c. administration. Conclusion This method of T20 administration may be a suitable alternative for selected patients who are not able to tolerate it when given subcutaneously. It may even be considered a priori in selected patients with extensive viral resistance who are unable or unwilling to inject T20 subcutaneously.
