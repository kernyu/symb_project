OBJECTIVES: Therapeutic potential of conventionally used platinum-based drugs in treatment of colorectal tumours has been limited due to high incidence of tumour resistance to them and to their severe side effects. This evokes a search for more suitable anti-cancer drugs. We have compared ability of oxaliplatin and a novel platinum(IV) complex, LA-12, to modulate the cell cycle and induce apoptosis in human colon adenocarcinoma HCT116 wt and p53/p21 null cells, and have investigated molecular mechanisms involved. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell cycle-related changes were analysed by flow cytometry (bromodeoxyuridine/propidium iodide staining, histone H3 phosphorylation). Apoptosis was detected using flow cytometry (assays monitoring caspase activity) and fluorescence microscopy (nuclear morphology). Changes in levels of genes/proteins involved in cell cycle and apoptosis regulation were examined by RT-PCR and western blotting. RESULTS: Our results highlight the outstanding ability of LA-12 to induce effective elimination of colon cancer cells independently of p53/p21, and in significantly lower doses compared to oxaliplatin. While oxaliplatin induced p53- and p21-dependent G2 -phase arrest associated with downregulation of cyclin B1 and Cdk1, LA-12 allowed cells to enter M-phase of the cell cycle regardless of p53/p21 status. CONCLUSIONS: Higher malignant cell toxicity and ability to bypass cell cycle arrest important for the cell damage repair suggest LA-12 to be a more effective candidate for elimination of colon tumours from a variety of genetic backgrounds, compared with oxaliplatin.
