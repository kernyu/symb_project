The species Escherichia coli comprises different subgroups with distinct phylogeny, physiology and ecology and, thus, presumably, with different roles in antimicrobial resistance dissemination. E. coli strains isolated from raw and treated municipal wastewater and from urban water streams were characterized in terms of phylogenetic groups, antimicrobial resistance patterns and the presence of class 1 and class 2 integrons. Our main objective was to investigate the contribution of the different phylo-groups in antimicrobial resistance dissemination in urban waters. Groups A and B1 were predominant in all types of water, evidencing, respectively, the lowest and the highest resistance prevalence. Municipal wastewater treatment was accompanied by significant increases of ciprofloxacin and streptomycin resistance (p<0.01). Antimicrobial resistance prevalence differed significantly between the different phylo-groups and within the same group, mainly in group A. Such differences contributed to explain the higher ciprofloxacin and streptomycin resistance rates observed in treated effluent in comparison with the raw wastewater. We conclude that the dynamics of the bacterial populations has a major role on the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance in the environment.
