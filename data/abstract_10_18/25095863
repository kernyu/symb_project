Clostridium difficile is a common cause of health-care associated diarrhoea. We describe the supplementary measures taken at Herlev Hospital to combat a concerning rise in number of cases. The measures taken involve implementation of antibiotic stewardship; meetings every two weeks between the cleaning department, head nurses, infection control nurse and a clinical microbiologist with plans for near future actions; prompt isolation of patients with diarrhoea; rapid, PCR-based diagnostics; room disinfection. Comparing 2011 with 2012 shows a total decline of 32.9%.
