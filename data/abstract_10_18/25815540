BACKGROUND: Catheter-related infections are the sixth leading cause of nosocomial infections with approximately 7% of cases. AIM: The aim of this work was to establish the bacterial epidemiology of the catheter and TIC culture (totally implantable catheter) at the Mohamed V Military Teaching Hospital (MVHMI), and to study the antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria isolated. METHODS: this is a retrospective study over 24 months, including the venous and arterial catheters as well as the TIC treated at the Microbiology laboratory of the MVHMI. The culture was realized by the quantitative Brun Buisson method. The antibiotic susceptibility was made according to the French Society guidelines. RESULTS: We have collected 282 cases with 255 catheters and 27 TIC. The significant rate culture was 51,42% (n=145) for catheters and TIC, including 90,43% catheters and 9,57% TIC. These catheters and TIC with positive culture emanated primarily from hemodialysis (32,41%) and surgical intensive care unit (28,97%) services. The microorganisms distribution by species showed the prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus (15,91%) followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (14,77%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7,39%). The meticilline resistance rate in Staphylococcus aureus was 7,14%. The Acinetobacter baumannii resistance rate was 64%, and 80,8% for imipenem and ceftazidime respectively. The rate of resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to imipenem and ceftazidime was 69.23% for each. CONCLUSION: The bacterial epidemiology of the catheters and TIC cultures is dominated by the potentially nosocomial bacteria. Multidrug resistance of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa requires an improved catheters management and strengthening nosocomial infections prevention.
