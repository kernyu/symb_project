BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to investigate, using a native mitomycin-C-resistant human Tenon's fibroblast cell line, the possibility that interferon-alpha and gamma could be used with Fas agonists as an alternative anti-fibrotic strategy to mitomycin-C in trabeculectomy. METHODS: A clinically resistant and in vitro verified mitomycin-C-resistant human Tenon's fibroblast cell line was pretreated with interferon-alpha and interferon-gamma for 48 h before stimulation with an agonistic Fas antibody (CH11) for 2 days to induce cell death. Cell death assays were undertaken. Changes in apoptosis-related proteins were determined by flow cytometry and Western blot. RESULTS: Pretreatment with interferon-alpha or interferon-gamma for 48 h increased Fas, Fas-associated protein with death domain and caspase-8 expression. Protein expression was further increased by combined exposure to interferon-alpha and gamma. Pretreatment with cytokines had no effect on Fas-L and Bcl-2. Interferon-alpha alone did not change the rate of induced cell death. A combination of interferon-alpha and gamma synergistically increased the sensitivity of mitomycin-C-resistant human Tenon's fibroblast cell line to induced cell death. An antagonistic anti-Fas antibody (ZB4) completely blocked induced cell death. Broad caspase inhibitors specific for caspases-8 and -3 reduced induced deaths in interferon pretreated mitomycin-C-resistant human Tenon's fibroblast cell line in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Interferon-alpha and interferon-gamma render mitomycin-C-resistant human Tenon's fibroblast cell line sensitive to Fas-mediated apoptosis. The mechanism involves increased death-inducing signalling complex formation by upregulation of Fas, Fas-associated protein with death domain and caspase-8 expression.
