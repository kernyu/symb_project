The chromosomal ampR(Xc) -bla(Xc) module is essential for the beta-lactam resistance of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris. Bla(Xc) beta-lactamase is expressed at a high basal level in the absence of an inducer and its expression can be further induced by beta-lactam. In enterobacteria, ampG encodes an inner membrane facilitator involved in the recycling of murein degradation compounds. An isogenic ampG mutant (XcampG) of X. campestris pv. campestris str. 17 (Xc17) was constructed to investigate the link between murein recycling and bla(Xc) expression. Our data demonstrate that (1) XcampG is susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics; (2) AmpG(Xc) is essential for expression of bla(Xc) ; (3) AmpGs of Xc17, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia KJ (SmKJ) and Escherichia coli DH5alpha can complement the defect of XcampG; (4) overexpression of AmpG(X) (c) significantly increased bla(Xc) expression; and (5) AmpG(Xc) from Xc17 is able to restore beta-lactamase induction of the ampN(Xc) -ampG(Xc) double mutant of SmKJ. In Xc17, ampG(Xc) can be expressed from the promoter residing in the intergenic region of ampN(Xc) -ampG(Xc) and the expression is independent of beta-lactam induction. AmpN, which is required for beta-lactamases induction in SmKJ, is not required for the beta-lactam antibiotic resistance of Xc17.
