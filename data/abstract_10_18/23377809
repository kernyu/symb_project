AIM: For frequency Escherichia (E.) coli is the agent of urinary tract infections (UTIs). The objective of the present study was to evaluate in vitro activity of several antimicrobial agents to guide empirical treatment of uncomplicated UTIs. In vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of 429 E. coli strains, isolated in urine specimens from community-acquired uncomplicated UTIs in outpatients, was studied during the 1st semester 2011. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Urine samples were processed with Robobact/Uriset system. E. coli strains were identified with GN card for VITEK-2 system and API 20E gallery, as confirmatory assay. E. coli strains were tested, for antimicrobial susceptibility, using VITEK-2 system and confirmed with disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Penicillins have exhibited sensitivity percentage of 50.9%, inhibitor-protected penicillins 88.9%, cephalosporins 91.6%, carbapenem 100%, aminoglycosides 91.5%, fluoroquinolones 71.8%, nitrofuran 99.3% and sulfonamide 74.1%. CONCLUSIONS: In vitro imipenem, nitrofurantoin, cephalosporins and aminoglycosides (>90% of isolates) have the best sensitivity in community-acquired UTIs. In particular nitrofurantoin has showed a low MIC distribution and high sensitivity percentage. Therefore, could be suggested in empirical treatment of these infections.
