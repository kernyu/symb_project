Antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated by two diffusion methods: E-test strips to determine minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and disk diffusion for amoxicillin, clarithromycin, metronidazole and ciprofloxacin in 30 Helicobacter pylori strains isolated from gastric biopsies. No strains were resistant to amoxicillin, 17% (5/30) were resistant to clarithromycin, 20% (6/30) ciprofloxacin by both methods, and 37% (11/30) to metronidazole by the E-test. Although the number of strains studied was reduced, there was a single mismatch in interpreting susceptibility when both methods were compared; the same mismatch was observed for metronidazole, being categorized as sensitive by the E-test and as intermediate by disk diffusion. No association between the histological type of lesion and the resistance pattern found could be determined.
