Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator used for managing breast cancer, is known to have antifungal activity. However, its molecular mechanism remains unknown. Using the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe as a model organism, we have explored the mechanism involved in antifungal action of tamoxifen. Since tamoxifen was shown to inhibit the binding of calmodulin to calcineurin in fungi, we first examined involvement of these molecules and found that overexpression of a catalytic subunit of calcineurin and its constitutively active mutant as well as calmodulin increases tamoxifen sensitivity. Since terbinafine and azoles inhibit enzymes for ergosterol biosynthesis, Erg1 and Erg11, for their antifungal actions, we also examined involvement of these molecules. Overexpression of Erg1 and Erg11 reduced the sensitivity to terbinafine and azoles, respectively, but increased tamoxifen sensitivity, suggesting that ergosterol biosynthesis is differently related to the action of tamoxifen and those of terbinafine and azoles. To elucidate molecules involved in tamoxifen action, we performed a genome-wide screen for altered sensitivity to tamoxifen using a fission yeast gene deletion library, and identified various hypersensitive and resistant mutants to this drug. Notably, these mutants are rarely overlapped with those identified in similar genetic screens with currently used antifungals, suggesting a novel mode of antifungal action. Furthermore, tamoxifen augmented antifungal actions of terbinafine and azoles, suggesting synergetic actions between these drugs. Therefore, our findings suggest that calmodulin-calcineurin pathway and ergosterol biosynthesis are related to antifungal action of tamoxifen, and propose novel targets for antifungal development as well as combined therapy with tamoxifen for fungal diseases.
