OBJECTIVES: To describe clinical and molecular characteristics of an outbreak due to metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) producing Klebsiella pneumoniae collected at Charles Nicolle Hospital of Tunis and to analyze the impact of outer membrane porin (OMP) loss on carbapenem resistance levels. METHODS: Between 2010 and 2015, 178 carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were isolated. Screening for MBL production was performed using combined disk diffusion method, with imipenem and ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) as inhibitors. Resistance genes and virulence factors were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. Genotyping was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing. Genetic environment of carbapenemase genes was determined by PCR mapping. Conjugation assays were performed, and plasmids were assigned to incompatibility groups by PCR-based replicon typing. OMPs were profiled by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrilamide gel electrophoresis, and porin genes were sequenced. RESULTS: Nineteen K. pneumoniae (10.6%) showing MBL activity were isolated from patients hospitalized on four different wards. NDM-1 was the only MBL identified, in association with blaOXA-48. All strains lacked at least one OMP, and carbapenem resistance levels were remarkably elevated in strains lacking OmpK35 and OmpK36. blaNDM-1 was located in IncFIA-type conjugative plasmid, with the same genetic context in all strains. The epidemiological diffusion of blaNDM-1 was due to two clones, one major clone belonging to sequence type (ST) 147 (n = 16) and the other clone belonging to ST307 (n = 3). CONCLUSIONS: This study describes an outbreak of NDM-1-producing K. pneumoniae strains, isolated from a Tunisian hospital, caused by two clones belonging to ST147 and ST307; and highlights the role of OMPs loss, in combination with beta-lactamase expression, in conferring high carbapenem resistance.
