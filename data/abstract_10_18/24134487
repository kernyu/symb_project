BACKGROUND: In this study, we aimed to establish the in vitro antifungal susceptibilities of terbinafine, miconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, griseofulvin, and amphotericin B against dermatophyte isolates. METHODS: One hundred and seventy-seven clinical isolates were tested: Trichophyton rubrum (n = 78), Trichophyton mentagrophytes (n = 49), Epidermophyton floccosum (n = 30), Trichophyton verrucosum (n = 16), and Trichophyton tonsurans (n = 4). The broth microdilution assay for antifungal susceptibility testing of dermatophytes was performed according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines in the M38-A2 document. RESULTS: Our minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) results showed that the values for terbinafine for all dermatophyte isolates were significantly lower than the values for amphotericin B, miconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, and griseofulvin. For T. rubrum isolates, amphotericin B was more active than miconazole, itraconazole, and ketoconazole. Among the antifungal drugs tested, griseofulvin had the highest minimum inhibitory concentration values for T. mentagrophytes isolates. CONCLUSION: Terbinafine was found to be the most effective antifungal drug against all tested dermatophyte isolates. Griseofulvin was the less active antifungal drug against T. mentagrophytes isolates. Performing antifungal susceptibility testing is especially important for screening the development of antifungal resistance.
