BACKGROUND: Monitoring the antibiotic resistance of microorganisms in a specific geographic area can be useful in developing new approaches to first-intention antibiotherapy. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe the evolution of resistance of Staphylococcus aureus to antibiotics routinely used at Saint Camille Medical Centre in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso from 1996 to 2006. METHOD: Strains of S. aureus, isolated from various pathologic sources were tested to determine their susceptibility to antibiotics. Sensitivity tests were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Antibiogram Committee of the French Society for Microbiology (version 2007). RESULTS: During the study period, 1160 staphylococci strains were isolated including 73.45% identified as S. aureus. Susceptibility tests demonstrated a significant increase in resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. The proportion of strains showing resistance to ampicillin reached 58.29% in 2000. Resistance to these antibiotics regressed significantly from 2000 to 2006. Resistance to pristinamycin and erythromycin showed a tendency to increase while resistance to gentamicin and oleandomycin showed no statistically significant change. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that S. aureus was the most common Staphylococcus genus present at the center and that it was resistant to several antibiotics. Reducing use of beta-lactam probably accounted for the significant decline in resistance to this type of antibiotic. Care should also be given to the use of other antibiotics such as pristinamycin and erythromycin since resistance appears to be increasing.
