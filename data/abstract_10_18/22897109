SHV beta-lactamases, including SHV extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, are widespread throughout the world, and confer a broad spectrum of resistance to antibiotic drugs. Mutations ranging from single base-pair substitutions to small deletions within bla(SHV) often result in diminished activity and an increased susceptibility to beta-lactamase inhibitors. Here, we collected 1,320 clinical isolates from three hospitals in Shanghai. We developed a novel oligonucleotide microarray to detect mutations in the bla(SHV) gene, and validated the array data by direct sequencing. Sixty-two of the 1,320 isolates carried the bla(SHV) gene. The genotypes of these 62 isolates were successfully called by the microarray and were consistent with the genotypes identified by bidirectional sequencing. Sixteen different bla(SHV) alleles were identified. The SHV-1 variant was the most frequent (32.26%), followed by SHV-11 (27.42%) and SHV-12 (25.81%). Of the 62 isolates, 12 contained two different bla(SHV) alleles. Our microarray significantly facilitated the identification of bla(SHV) variants, which makes it an attractive option for the detection of SHV variants in clinical laboratories.
