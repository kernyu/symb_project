The intent of this chapter is to review the types of adverse drug reactions and interactions associated with antimicrobial agents, specifically in the setting of patients with malignancies. The initial sections will discuss categorizing and describing the mechanisms of adverse reactions and interactions. The later sections include a detailed discussion about adverse reactions and drug interactions associated with commonly used antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal agents in this subpopulation. Where relevant, the clinical use and indication for the drugs will be reviewed. The antibacterial section will specifically address the emergence of antimicrobial resistance and drugs of last resort (newer agents, such as linezolid and daptomycin and novel uses of older previously retired agents, such as polymyxin B). The antifungal section will address the ramification of pharmacokinetic interactions and the need to measure drug levels. The chapter is not meant to be exhaustive and as such will not extensively address all antimicrobials or all interactions for each of these agents.
