Physiological properties of a selected Staphylococcus epidermidis strain 33 GISK VAN(R) with high resistance to vancomycin, multiple resistance to various antibiotics, as well as decreased sensitivity to lysozyme, lysostaphin, and the low-molecular mass peptide warnerin were studied. The strain was characterized by a thicker cell wall, resulting in considerably decreased rates of vancomycin penetration into the cells and in limited access of the antibiotic to its targets on the bacterial membrane.
