The high incidence of mortality in patients with severe burns can be attributed to bloodstream infections caused by drug-resistant microorganisms. Multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA), multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and class 1 integron PCR amplification were performed to investigate an extensively drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (XDR-AB) strain recovered from a blood culture of a patient admitted to a burn intensive care unit in St Petersburg (Russian Federation). This case study describes an XDR-AB strain of multilocus sequence type ST231 with a blaGES-12 gene cassette encoding a very potent ceftazidimase located inside of a composite class 1 integron. This is the first documented case of XDR-AB belonging to the international clonal lineage I in Russia.
