Until 2014, docetaxel chemotherapy had been performed as a castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) treatment and continued as long as possible because we had no other option except docetaxel. Recently, several new agents including abiraterone, enzalutamide and cabazitaxel are available for CRPC patients. Although we have several treatment options, they are not curative and most of CRPC patients ultimately develop resistance. Furthermore, because AR targeted agents have cross-resistance each other, the taxane chemotherapy that is expected to have less cross-resistance to AR targeted agents may play an important role in the case of AR targeted agent failure. It is crucial about when to start chemotherapy or to switch from docetaxel to cabazitaxel.
