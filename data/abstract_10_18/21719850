Fourteen vanA-containing enterococcal isolates were detected in seven of 52 fecal samples (13.5%) from free-ranging red foxes in Portugal. Nine of the vanA-containing isolates were Enterococcus faecium and five were E. durans. Both sequence types, ST262 and ST273, were identified among E. faecium isolates.
