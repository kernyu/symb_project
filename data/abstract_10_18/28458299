High-level vancomycin resistance among Staphylococcus aureus poses a grave threat to global health as the treatment options for this pathogen are very limited. A detailed evaluation of the genetic background of vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) is expected to facilitate the understanding of its origin and pathogenicity. In this study, we performed the genetic analysis of the clinical VRSA isolates and identified the genetic basis of resistance to multiple antibiotics among these strains, based on the available draft genome sequences. In addition, we generated the draft genome of the strain VRS3b, which was considered to be same as VRS3a based on its isolation from the same patient. We found that strain VRS3b did not harbor the genes responsible for tetracycline and gentamicin, which was further confirmed by the sensitivity towards these antibiotics. Our results suggest that the strains VRS3a and VRS3b are different from the view of antibiotic resistance and highlight the possibility of generation of two distinct VRSA strains from the same patient.
