BACKGROUND: The present work was aimed to study the prevalence of the drug resistance among Gram positive and Gram negative organisms isolated from clinical samples obtained from various private nursing homes of Jalgaon city and surrounding areas in the state of Maharashtra. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Different pathogenic organisms were isolated from one thousand seven hundred and ninety clinical samples obtained from various nursing homes of Jalgaon region of North Maharashtra, MS, India during the period of August, 2010 to July, 2011. Antibiotic sensitivity testing of isolated pathogenic organisms was done with fifty different antibiotics of 13 different groups by the disk diffusion technique using Mueller Hinton Agar Plates according to CLSI (formerly NCCLS) guidelines. RESULTS: Out of total samples analyzed 1171 samples showed the presence of infection while in 619 samples no growth of organisms was seen on culture medium. Microbial growth revealed presence of 11 different organisms (E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacter spp., Salmonella spp., Acinetobater spp., Streptococccus spp., Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA and MSSA)) including Candida spp. Sensitivity profile of these organisms towards different antibiotics is reported here. CONCLUSION: The study resulted in generation of representative status of the antibiotic sensitivity pattern of commonly found organisms in nosocomial infections in the region. This could be useful for the clinicians to choose correct antibiotic and ensure the judicious use of the same for their patients.
