This work aims to investigate the possible mechanism of action of the homologue peptide Pa-MAP based on the Antarctic fish Pleuronectes americanus, through a study by electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of models of bilayer lipid membranes supported (BLM-s) on solid substrates. For comparison and validation of the data obtained by EIS, we also conducted a study evaluating the human peptide LL-37, whose mechanism of action is well described in the literature: its dielectric response was found to be similar to that of Pa-MAP. The results obtained indicate that Pa-MAP has a good potential for use as a membrane-disrupting peptide and also suggest that the corresponding mechanism of action occurs according to the carpet model followed by a detergent-like effect. The addition of either one of these peptides at different concentrations resulted in a drastic decrease in the membrane's resistance, after just 1min of exposure. Additionally, it was seen that the peptides Pa-MAP and LL-37 may act on membranes with different charges, in an indication of a possible broad spectrum antimicrobial activity. These interactions with different membrane compositions have been attributed to the peptides' structure, mainly due to the presence of many hydrophobic amino acid residues, as observed by in silico studies. Here, we describe the Pa-MAP mechanism of action for the first time. Furthermore, we report the data demonstrating that EIS can be used for studies of peptide-membranes interaction, even when small changes on the surface of the electrode can be detected.
