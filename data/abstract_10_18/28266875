BACKGROUND: This study investigated whether levofloxacin-containing concomitant therapy can effectively eradicate Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: A total of 797 T2DM patients were screened for anti-H. pylori IgG antibodies, and the presence of H. pylori infection was confirmed by (13)C-urea breath test. We prospectively randomized 114 of these patients to receive either 10 d of levofloxacin-concomitant therapy (n = 55) or sequential therapy (n = 59). Antimicrobial resistance of H. pylori isolates collected from the patients with T2DM (n = 109) and dyspeptic controls without DM (n = 110) was determined using the E-test. This study was approved by our Institutional Review Board (A-BR-103-021). RESULTS: The H. pylori eradication rates with concomitant therapy were higher than sequential therapy in both intention-to-treat (96.4% versus 81.4%, p = 0.012) and per-protocol (100% versus 85.4%, p = 0.006) analysis. The adverse effects in both groups were similarly mild. In the patients who received sequential therapy, clarithromycin resistance was significantly associated with eradication failure (p = 0.02). There were no significant differences in the antibiotic-resistant rates to amoxicillin, clarithromycin, metronidazole, tetracycline, and levofloxacin between the patients with and without T2DM. CONCLUSIONS: Ten days of levofloxacin-containing concomitant therapy is an effective and well-tolerated treatment to eradicate H. pylori infection for T2DM patients. Key messages Ten days of levofloxacin-containing concomitant therapy is well tolerated and superior to clarithromycin-containing sequential therapy for first-line H. pylori eradication in patients with type 2 diabetes. Clarithromycin resistance to H. pylori is the main factor associated with eradication failure in clarithromycin-containing sequential therapy in diabetic patients.
