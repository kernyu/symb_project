Despite investment in programs to manage the development of resistance to existing agents, this continues to drive the need for discovery of novel antiparasitic agents for veterinary medicine. Historically, antiparasitic drug discovery was driven by empirical screening, but technological advances have lead to an increased focus on mechanism-based approaches to drug discovery and this is projected to increase as our capabilities advance to improve both the throughput of assays and the quality of data generated. Investment in the development of combination products with novel agents is increasing and, despite regulatory hurdles in some regions, efforts to globally harmonize regulations will aid in delivering safe, efficacious drugs to help in resistance management and integrated parasite control programs.
