Mupirocin is used for the decolonization of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). High-level mupirocin resistance (Hi-Mup(R)) is of concern, having been associated with therapeutic failure. Our main objective was to assess the emergence and mode/s of spread of Hi-Mup(R) in the MRSA population recovered between 2002 and 2009 in four health care settings in the Pontevedra province, northwest Spain. Five hundred and fifty consecutive clinical MRSA isolates were obtained and screened for antimicrobial susceptibility. Isolates were stratified into multidrug-resistant (MDR) and non-MDR. High-level mupirocin resistant MRSA were characterized by genotyping and plasmid analysis. Thirty-one MRSA (5.6%) exhibited Hi-Mup(R). No association was detected between Hi-Mup(R) and MDR but isolates displaying Hi-Mup(R) were more likely to be resistant to gentamicin and tobramycin. Four main MRSA clones were identified: ST125/t067/PFGE A, ST36/t018/PFGE D, ST8/t008/PFGE B, and ST72/t148 or t3092/PFGE B. Each isolate carried the Hi-Mup(R)ileS2-encoding gene on plasmids and ten plasmid types were distinguished based on unique IS257-ileS2 configurations. Some plasmid types were successfully disseminated among the MRSA clones. Remarkably, six plasmid types were acquired by the predominant genotype ST125/t067/PFGE A. In conclusion, molecular characterization of MRSA isolates combined with the rapid typing of ileS2-encoding plasmids through determination of IS257-ileS2 configurations have proved to be a powerful strategy to address the molecular epidemiology of Hi-Mup(R). The transmission of a diverse set of ileS2-carrying plasmids promoted the emergence of the resistance, with a limited role of clonal expansion in its dispersion.
