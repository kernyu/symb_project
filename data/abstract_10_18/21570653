BACKGROUND: NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis) is considered the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome (MS). We aimed to analyze lipid, carbohydrate, and iron metabolism in NASH. PATIENTS, METHODS: 37 patients with MS (17 M/20 F, 51+/-15 years), elevated transaminases; 25 patients had histologically proven NASH (NAS score>/=5), 12 patients had toxic background (nonNASH). 37 age, sex, BMI-matched healthy controls. Lipid variables, LDL-subfractions, iron, ferritin, transferrin (T), transferrin saturation (TS), and hepcidin (H) were measured in patients/controls. Oral glucose tolerance tests were performed. RESULTS: NASH patients with steatosis gr. 2 and 3 (>33% hepatic fat) had higher sd-LDL (mg/dl) concentrations than patients with steatosis gr. 1 (<33%) (p=0.002), nonNASH patients (p=0.03) and controls (p=0.001). Sd absolute (mg/dl) correlated directly with the steatosis grade only in patients with NASH and steatosis >33% (p=0.04). NASH-patients showed higher insulin, C-peptide and IRI values than nonNASH patients (p=0.034; 0.032; 0.04). H was increased in patients versus controls (p<0.001). H correlated with ferritin in MS-patients (p=0.01), correlated directly with sd-LDL (mg/dl) (p=0.017) and IRI (p<0.001) and indirectly with HDL (p=0.05) in NASH. No associations between hepatic inflammation/iron content on liver biopsy and variables of lipid metabolism were found but hepcidin correlated with hepatic inflammation in all patients and with NAS scores in NASH. CONCLUSIONS: NASH-patients show insulin resistance and increased sd-LDL subfractions, suggesting an atherogenic profile. The correlation of H with sd-LDL and IRI, without relation to hepatic iron content suggests a putative link between inflammation, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in NASH.
