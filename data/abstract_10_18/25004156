We report on the aptadetection of chloramphenicol (CAP) using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The detection principle is based on the changes of the interfacial properties of the electrode after the interaction of the ssDNA aptamers with the target molecules. The electrode surface is partially blocked due to the formation of the aptamer-CAP complex, resulting in an increase of the interfacial electron-transfer resistance of the redox probe detected by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy or cyclic voltammetry. We observed that the ratio of polarization resistance had a linear relationship with the concentrations of CAP in the range of 1.76-127 nM, and a detection limit of 1.76 nM was obtained. The covalent binding of CAP-aptamer on the electrode surface combined with the unique properties of aptamers and impedimetric transduction leads to the development of a stable and sensitive electrochemical aptasensor for CAP.
