The aim of the study was to isolate gram-positive cocci from cows with mastitis and to determine their resistance to beta-lactamic antibiotics. Eight hundred and nine strains were isolated and identified as staphylococci (n=516), streptococci (n=199) and enterococci (n=94) from sub-clinical and clinical cases of bovine mastitis in Lithuania. The most common causative agents of udder disease included: S. epidermidis (n=176), S. aureus (n=176), S. agalactiae (n=134), S. hyicus (136) and E. hirae (n=68). Isolates were analysed for antimicrobial resistance to penicillin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, cephalothin, cephalexin, amoxicillin + clavulanate. The susceptibility patterns were analysed using the agar disk diffusion method. S. aureus showed the highest level of resistance to amoxicillin (81.3%), penicillin (76.7%) and ampicillin (78.4%). The corresponding values for CNS strains were 59.7%, 59.7% and 50.6% against penicillin, ampicillin and amoxicillin respectively. Streptococci were the most frequently resistant to amoxicillin (29.3%), and enterococci to penicillin (27%), amoxicillin (27.5%) and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (23.8%). The resistance of all tested mastitis pathogens to aminopenicillins and penicillin highly correlated (r=0.83). Compared with other antibiotics, amoxicillin and clavulanic acid combination tended to be more effective (p<0.05) against all tested bacteria in vitro. However, S. aureus, in 38.1% of cases, was resistant to this combination of antimicrobials. This study demonstrates that S. epidermidis, S. aureus, S. hyicus, S. agalactiae and E. hirae remain the most frequent mastitis causative agents on Lithuanian cattle farms. The highest resistance in vitro to penicillins was demonstrated by S. aureus, S. hyicus and S. intermedius. Resistance to cephalosporins remains low, irrespective of bacterial species of gram-positive cocci.
