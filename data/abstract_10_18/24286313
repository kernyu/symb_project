Bortezomib has been known as the most promising anti-cancer drug for multiple myeloma (MM). However, recent studies reported that not all MM patients respond to bortezomib. To overcome such a stumbling-block, studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms of bortezomib resistance. In this study, we established a bortezomib-resistant cell line (U266/velR), and explored its biological characteristics. The U266/velR showed reduced sensitivity to bortezomib, and also showed crossresistance to the chemically unrelated drug thalidomide. U266/velR cells had a higher proportion of CD138 negative subpopulation, known as stem-like feature, compared to parental U266 cells. U266/velR showed relatively less inhibitory effect of prosurvival NF-kappaB signaling by bortezomib. Further analysis of RNA microarray identified genes related to ubiquitination that were differentially regulated in U266/velR. Moreover, the expression level of CD52 in U266 cells was associated with bortezomib response. Our findings provide the basis for developing therapeutic strategies in bortezomib-resistant relapsed and refractory MM patients.
