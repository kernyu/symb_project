OBJECTIVE: Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) gene (lukS/F-PV)-positive community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA), particularly the USA300 clone, is a health concern worldwide. Recently, CA-MRSA clones have been found to spread and persist in hospital settings. In this study, we aimed to investigate the prevalence and molecular epidemiological features of lukS/F-PV-positive MRSA in Japanese hospitals. METHODS: A total of 3,433 MRSA isolated from nine hospitals in 2011-2015 were used. Molecular epidemiological analysis performed by staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC) mec typing, PVL typing, arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME) typing, detection of virulence determinants, multilocus sequence typing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. RESULT: The detection rate of lukS/F-PV was increased annually from 0.6% (5/817) in 2011 to 3.1% (17/544) in 2015. Molecular epidemiological analysis for 64 lukS/F-PV-positive MRSA isolates revealed that 42 isolates (64.1%) were the USA300 clone. Resistance rates of levofloxacin and gentamicin among lukS/F-PV-positive isolates increased annually due to increased prevalence of the multidrug-resistant USA300 clone. CONCLUSION: This is the first report on dissemination of the USA300 clone and PVL-positive MRSA in multiple Japanese hospitals. Our data strongly suggested that the USA300 clone may become epidemic in Japanese hospitals.
