Nosocomial infections due to Klebsiella pneumoniae is a significant problem in health care settings worldwide. In this study, we examined the antimicrobial susceptibility, genetic profiles and mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in K. pneumoniae isolates of Indian origin. To our knowledge this is the first report demonstrating the high prevalence of beta-lactamases, aminoglycoside modifying enzymes, quinolone resistance genes besides demonstrating the involvement of active efflux in K. pneumoniae Indian isolates. This study has enabled us to correlate the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics in K. pneumoniae, providing an important base for continued monitoring and epidemiological studies of this emerging nosocomial pathogen in Indian hospitals.
