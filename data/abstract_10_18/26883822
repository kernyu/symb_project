UNLABELLED: Bacteria use two-component signal transduction systems (TCSs) to sense and respond to environmental changes via a conserved phosphorelay between a sensor histidine kinase and its cognate response regulator. The opportunistic pathogen Enterococcus faecalis utilizes a TCS comprised of the histidine kinase CroS and the response regulator CroR to mediate resistance to cell wall stresses such as cephalosporin antibiotics, but the molecular details by which CroRS promotes cephalosporin resistance have not been elucidated. Here, we analyzed mutants of E. faecalis carrying substitutions in CroR and CroS to demonstrate that phosphorylated CroR drives resistance to cephalosporins, and that CroS exhibits kinase and phosphatase activities to control the level of CroR phosphorylation in vivo. Deletion of croS in various lineages of E. faecalis revealed a CroS-independent mechanism for CroR phosphorylation and led to the identification of a noncognate histidine kinase capable of influencing CroR (encoded by OG1RF_12162; here called cisS). Further analysis of this TCS network revealed that both systems respond to cell wall stress. IMPORTANCE: TCSs allow bacteria to sense and respond to many different environmental conditions. The opportunistic pathogen Enterococcus faecalis utilizes the CroRS TCS to mediate resistance to cell wall stresses, including clinically relevant antibiotics such as cephalosporins and glycopeptides. In this study, we use genetic and biochemical means to investigate the relationship between CroRS signaling and cephalosporin resistance in E. faecalis cells. Through this, we uncovered a signaling network formed between the CroRS TCS and a previously uncharacterized TCS that also responds to cell wall stress. This study provides mechanistic insights into CroRS signaling and cephalosporin resistance in E. faecalis.
