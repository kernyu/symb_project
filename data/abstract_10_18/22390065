Diarrhoea, dysentery and other diseases due to other enteric bacteria have reportedly been found to resist chemotherapeutic treatment in some West African communities with fatal consequences in some cases. This study was carried out to determine multidrug resistance patterns of Enterobacteria isolates from processed ready-to-eat foods. Indigenously processed food samples of different types were collected from two Francophone and two Anglophone countries in the West African sub-region during the wet and dry seasons of a sampling period of two years. Enterobacteria were isolated from the samples using standard techniques. Amplification of chromosomal DNA of the isolates using the Polymerase Chain Reaction was carried out. The results obtained were subjected to statistical analyses. All isolates showed resistance to cefuroxime (90.7%), nitrofurantoin (90.6%), augmentin (86.1%) and ampicillin (51.2%) while all were sensitive to gentamycin and ciprofloxacin. There was amplification indicating the presence of invA gene at a position of 240 bp. There was no amplification at all for the spvC gene in any of the isolates tested. Multidrug resistant enteric bacteria in these foods containing the invA gene could lead to infections with uncontrolled antibiotic use. The presence of enteric bacteria in the foods analyzed which provide undeniable evidence of the poor microbiological quality of these foods could form the basis of a useful databank in formulation of food-borne disease control and prevention strategies.
