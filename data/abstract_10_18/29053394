INTRODUCTION: Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) is a chronic infection of the liver and the leading cause of liver failure and liver transplantation worldwide. While prior HCV therapies were prolonged and had variable success rates, the advent of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) has dramatically improved HCV therapy with minimal side effects, shorter treatment durations, and higher cure rates. Areas covered: In this paper, we review the literature discussing the use of Vedroprevir (GS-9451) in treatment of HCV in a variety of patient populations. Articles accessible on MEDLINE/PubMed were reviewed to provide context on chemistry, pharmacology, and efficacy of Vedroprevir in HCV treatment. Expert opinion: Vedroprevir is highly effective in reducing treatment duration in combination with other DAAs without compromising treatment success rates. GS-9451 is insufficient as HCV monotherapy due to low threshold for development of high level of resistance and must be combined with other DAAs to achieve sustained virologic response (SVR).
