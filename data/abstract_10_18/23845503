Fifty non-duplicate multiresistant isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from a regional hospital in Northern Thailand were investigated for their antimicrobial susceptibility, presence of class 1 integrons and arrangement of gene cassettes as well as their genetic relationships. All but one isolate were classified as extensively drug-resistant P. aeruginosa (XDR-PA). Forty-one isolates (82%) were found to carry class 1 integrons. Amplification of the variable regions of class 1 integrons revealed seven diverse bands ranging in size from 0.7 kb to 7.0 kb. Sequence analysis of class 1 integron variable regions revealed the presence of several gene cassettes associated with resistance to aminoglycosides (aac, aad and aph), including the aac(3)-Ic cassette reported for the first time in Thailand. Gene cassettes encoding resistance to chloramphenicol (cmlA), beta-lactams (bla(PSE), bla(OXA) and bla(VEB)) and rifampicin (arr) were found. The putative small multidrug resistance protein (smr) and an open-reading frame with unknown function (orfD) were also detected. The aadA6-orfD cassette array was the most common integron found in this study. Integron-positive isolates had higher frequencies of antimicrobial resistance than isolates lacking integrons. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) demonstrated the occurrence of horizontal gene transfer. Interestingly, a large number of XDR-PA isolates carrying identical integrons clearly exhibited the same PFGE pattern, indicating nosocomial spread of these isolates. The presence of XDR-PA carrying class 1 integrons is implicated in the possible spread of drug-resistant organisms, therefore screening for integron-positive P. aeruginosa might be necessary for protection against nosocomial infection.
