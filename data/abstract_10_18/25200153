OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of duck albumin (ALB) gene on the mRNA expression levels of interferon beta (IFN-beta) and myxovirus resistance-1 (Mx1). METHODS: The duck ALB gene was subcloned into pEGFP-C1 eukaryotic expression vector, and then the pEGFP-C1-ALB was transiently transfected into chick fibroblast DF-1 by Lipofectamine(TM) 2000. Twenty-four hours later, real-time quantitative PCR was applied to detect the dynamic change of IFN-beta and Mx1 mRNA expressions under the stimulation of polyinosinic polycytidylic acid (PolyI:C). RESULTS: The pEGFP-C1-ALB was constructed successfully, and transfected into DF-1 effectively. The expression levels of IFN-beta and Mx1 gene in cells transfected with pEGFP-C1-ALB were significantly lower than those transfected with pEGFP-C1 after 12-hour stimulation of PolyI:C (P<0.05 or P<0.01). CONCLUSION: The expression levels of IFN-beta and Mx1 mRNA were down-regulated by over-expression of duck ALB gene.
