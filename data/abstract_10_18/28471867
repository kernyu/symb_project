BACKGROUND: In Greece, there are high rates of methicillin (40%-60%) and clindamycin (15%-25%) resistance among community-acquired Staphylococcus aureus isolates. Therefore, we sought to identify other antimicrobial treatment options such as daptomycin. METHODS: We studied retrospectively all pediatric infections treated with daptomycin at the University General Hospital of Larissa, Greece, from January 1, 2007, to June 16, 2016. RESULTS: Of a total of 128 patients (median age: 2.8 years; range: 8 days to 14.5 years; 76.6% <7 years) treated with daptomycin, 45 (35.2%) had invasive infection, most frequently musculoskeletal, and 83 (64.8%) had noninvasive infection, that is, complicated skin and soft tissue infection. S. aureus was the most commonly recovered pathogen (n = 61) (63.9% methicillin-resistant isolates, 21.3% clindamycin-resistant). The average daily dose of daptomycin was 10 mg/kg qd, and the median duration of therapy was 10 days. Daptomycin was administered alone (n = 61) or in combination therapy (n = 67), most frequently with rifampin (n = 40) and/or a beta-lactam antibiotic (n = 33). Open or closed drainage was performed in 86 (67.2%) of the total number of patients. Of 128 treated patients, 123 (96.1%) achieved clinical success, 114 (89.1%) had complete remission, and 9 (7%) had improvement of their disease. There were no failures with daptomycin therapy. The adverse events were of no clinical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Daptomycin administered alone or in combination with other antimicrobial agents to children was efficacious and well tolerated in the treatment of complicated infections of suspected or proven staphylococcal etiology.
