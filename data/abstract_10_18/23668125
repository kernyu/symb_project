In recent years, chlorine-resistant bacteria were detected in drinking water distribution systems which threatened the drinking water safety. Our group detected one strain named Mycobacteria mucogenicum from the drinking water distribution system of a city in south China. This paper studied chlorine resistance and mechanism of Mycobacteria mucogenicum. Inactivation experiments of one strain Mycobacteria mucogenicum were conducted with free chlorine, monochloramind and chlorine dioxide. The CT values of 99.9% inactivation by free chlorine, monochloramine and chlorine dioxide were detected as (76.25 +/- 47.55)mg.min.L-1, (1396 +/-382)mg.min.L-1, (13.5 +/- 4.9) mg.min L-1. Using transmission electronmicroscopy (TEM) observed the inactivation process of Mycobacteria mucogenicum. The bacteria surface hydrophobic of Mycobacteria mucogenicum was 37.2%. Mycobacteria mucogenicum has a higher hydrophobicity than other bacteria which prevented the diffusion of chlorine into cells. Mycobacteria mucogenicum is more resistant to chorine than other bacteria.
