Our aim was to monitor the resistance of Campylobacter isolates from two initial stages of broiler production in 5 grandparent breeder broiler farms (GPBFs) and 12 parent breeder broiler farms (PBFs) in which no antimicrobials were used during the study. Susceptibility tests were carried out for 805 strains (697 Campylobacter jejuni and 108 Campylobacter coli) against nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, tetracycline, gentamicin, and chloramphenicol using the disk-diffusion method. Quinolone resistance was the most abundant overall (74.9%) and at each stage of production. The second largest resistance was for tetracycline with 48.2%. The resistance against amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, gentamicin, and chloramphenicol was not found. The percentages of resistance and multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates were always higher in the PBFs than in the GPBFs. However, pan-susceptible populations (total 10.3%) were isolated in our survey. C. coli isolates were more resistant to tetracycline and erythromycin (96.3% and 23.1%, respectively) than for C. jejuni (40.7% and 0%, respectively) and were more MDR (33.3% vs. 11.9%). In conclusion, as other authors have shown, even in the absence of antibiotic pressure, relatively high rates of quinolone resistance are found in Campylobacter. However, a decrease in quinolone resistance has been observed compared to other studies in Spain [i.e., 99%; Saenz et al. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000;44(2):267-271]. MDR, fluoroquinolone-, macrolide-, and tetracycline-resistant Campylobacter populations are issues of concern in public health.
