Multidrug-resistant (MDR) cytomegalovirus (CMV) emerged after transient responses to ganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir in a CMV-seropositive recipient who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a CMV-seronegative donor. Experimental treatments using leflunomide and artesunate failed. Re-transplantation from a CMV-seropositive donor supported by adoptive transfer of pp65-specific T cells and maribavir was followed by lasting suppression. This case illustrates that successful MDR CMV therapy may require individualized multidisciplinary approaches.
