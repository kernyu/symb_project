MxA is an antiviral protein induced by type I interferons (IFN) and some viruses; MxA gene expression is an appropriate marker for measuring biologic activity of exogenous IFNbeta, as its induction indicates IFNAR receptor stimulation. A recent study has shown that measurement of MxA mRNA, after 1 year of treatment, predicts clinical responsiveness to IFNbeta therapy. Loss of IFNbeta bioactivity is mostly due to anti-IFNbeta antibodies (both neutralizing and binding), non-compliance and receptor saturation. The aim of this study was to evaluate all possible causes of loss of IFNbeta bioactivity after 1 year in treated patients. One hundred sixty-seven multiple sclerosis (MS) patients were included. One year after beginning IFNbeta therapy, each patient underwent a blood test; MxA gene expression was measured by real time PCR, antiviral CPE assay to detect neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), and capture-ELISA (cELISA) to measure binding antibodies (BAbs). For MxA an upper normal threshold of 87 (RE) was considered, 20 TRU/mL was the threshold for NAbs, and 1 U for BAbs positivity. Thirty-seven out of 167 patients (22%) were MxA-negative; of these, 22 were both BAbs and NAbs+, whereas 12 were BAbs+ but Nabs-, and three were both BAbs and NAbs-. The following conclusions were drawn from the study: (1) MxA mRNA should be measured after 1 year of IFNbeta therapy; (2) after 1 year of IFNbeta treatment, absence of IFNbeta bioactivity was detected in 22% of the patients; (3) different biological phenomena and reduced compliance explain this absence; (4) identification of the reason for absence of IFN bioactivity improves patients' management.
