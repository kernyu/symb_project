Staphylococcus aureus remains a causative agent for morbidity and mortality worldwide. This is in part a result of antimicrobial resistance, highlighting the need to uncover novel antibiotic targets and to discover new therapeutic agents. In the present study, we explored the possibility that iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster synthesis is a viable antimicrobial target. RNA interference studies established that Suf (sulfur mobilization)-dependent Fe-S cluster synthesis is essential in S. aureus We found that sufCDSUB were cotranscribed and that suf transcription was positively influenced by sigma factor B. We characterized an S. aureus strain that contained a transposon inserted in the intergenic space between sufC and sufD (sufD*), resulting in decreased transcription of sufSUB Consistent with the transcriptional data, the sufD* strain had multiple phenotypes associated with impaired Fe-S protein maturation. They included decreased activities of Fe-S cluster-dependent enzymes, decreased growth in media lacking metabolites that require Fe-S proteins for synthesis, and decreased flux through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Decreased Fe-S cluster synthesis resulted in sensitivity to reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species, as well as increased DNA damage and impaired DNA repair. The sufD* strain also exhibited perturbed intracellular nonchelated Fe pools. Importantly, the sufD* strain did not exhibit altered exoprotein production or altered biofilm formation, but it was attenuated for survival upon challenge by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The results presented are consistent with the hypothesis that Fe-S cluster synthesis is a viable target for antimicrobial development.
