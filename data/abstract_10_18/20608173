The primary structures of DNA-polymerase (ul30) and thymidine kinase (ul23) genes from several herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) clinical isolates which differed in sensitivity for a number of antiherpetic drugs were determined and compared with those for two laboratory HSV-1 strains one of which was ACV-sensitive (L2), while the another was resistant (L2) to ACV. The phylogenetic analysis of the sequences showed that conserved regions of ul30 gene of HSV-1 clinical isolates and L2 strain were homologous with the exception of point mutations and degenerated substitutions. Several new mutations in the HSV-1 DNA-polymerase and thymidine kinase functional domains were established and identified as the substitutions associated with the strain-resistance to ACV and other drugs.
