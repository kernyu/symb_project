The emergence and spread of carbapenems-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) in burn ward is an important threat to burn management. CRKP isolates are resistant to almost all available antibiotics and are susceptible only to polymyxins and tigecycline. The mechanism of the drug resistance of CRKP is associated with the plasmid-encoded carbapenemase Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), a carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase. Antibiotics which can currently be used to treat CRKP infection include polymyxins, tigecycline, and some aminoglycosides. The efficacy of using antibiotics in combination is better than that of single-agent therapy for the treatment of CRKP infection in bloodstream. In order to control CRKP infection in burn patients, strategies for preventing CRKP dissemination in burn ward are strongly advocated.
