BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli isolates displaying multidrug-resistance (MDR) are a major health care problem that results in mortality and morbidity. Integrons are DNA elements in E.coli that are related to antibiotic resistance. The aim of this study was to determine class 1 and 2 integrons and MDR in E. coli isolates obtained from patients in two Sanandaj hospitals, located in Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 120 isolates of E. coli were obtained from clinical specimens (from November 2013 to April 2014), and the susceptibility of E. coli antimicrobial agents was determined using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method according to the CLSI. PCR were applied for detection of class 1 and 2 integrons in E. coli isolates. SPSS software v16 and the x03C7;2 test were used for statistical analysis in order to calculate the association between antibiotic resistance and the presence of integrons (p < 0.05). RESULTS: In a total of 120 E. coli isolates, 42.5% had MDR. Integrons were found in 50.9% of the MDR isolates, and included 47.05% class 1 and 3.92% class 2 integrons. The strains did not have both classes of integrons simultaneously. An association between resistance to antibiotics and integrons was found. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that int1 and int2 genes present in E. coli isolates obtained from patients cause MDR in this isolates. Since such bacteria are a reservoir for the transmission of MDR bacteria, appropriate programs are necessary to reduce this problem.
