BACKGROUND: Pulmonary nocardiosis is a rare but severe infection caused by Nocardia species. This study aimed at describing the clinical characteristics and prognosis of pulmonary nocardiosis. METHODS: An observational, retrospective study was undertaken of patients diagnosed with pulmonary nocardiosis over a 13-year period at the Kinki-Chuo Chest Medical Center, Osaka, Japan. RESULTS: Seven patients with airway nocardial colonization and 59 patients with pulmonary nocardiosis were identified, one of whom had disseminated nocardiosis. Patients with pulmonary nocardiosis were predominantly male patients (73%), with a mean age of 66 (range, 15-88) years. New-onset cough and dyspnea were the most common manifestations (76%). Although 52 (88%) patients had at least one underlying pulmonary disease, most patients did not appear to be systemically immunocompromised. The predominant abnormality on chest computed tomography in pulmonary nocardiosis was airspace consolidation (52%), sometimes associated with cavitation. Multivariate Cox proportional-hazards analysis revealed the following significant and independent risk factors for overall mortality: age >68 years (hazard ratio [HR], 4.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-14; p=0.05), pulmonary aspergillosis (HR, 8.8; 95% CI, 2.4-33; p=0.01), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) resistance (HR, 4.3; 95% CI, 1.6-11; p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware that pulmonary nocardiosis can occur even in immunocompetent patients, especially those with an underlying pulmonary disease. In pulmonary nocardiosis, older age, pulmonary aspergillosis, and TMP-SMZ resistance are associated with increased risk of mortality.
