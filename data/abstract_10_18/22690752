This study was conducted to identify the molecular mechanisms of imipenem resistance in a Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp16137) isolate recovered in August 2008 at the University Hospital Sahloul, Sousse, Tunisia. The strain was identified with the API 20E system; antibiotic-containing disks were used for detection of antibiotic susceptibility by a disk diffusion assay. We investigated the presence of beta-lactamases by PCR, using specific primers for bla(TEM), bla(SHV), bla(CTX-M), bla(OXA), bla(CMY), bla(ACC), bla(FOX), bla(IMP), bla(KPC), bla(VIM), and by sequencing. Extraction of plasmid DNA from Kp16137 and the transconjugant was performed by the method of Kado. Southern transfer was performed on nylon. The membrane was hybridized with a specific probe for the bla(CMY-2) gene. Outer membrane proteins were isolated and were examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide gel. K. pneumoniae Kp16137 was resistant to all available beta-lactams, including third generation cephalosporins and carbapenems. The screening of beta-lactamases showed the presence of three beta-lactamases: TEM-1, SHV-61, and CMY-4. The CMY-4 beta-lactamase was located on an 80-kb plasmid. An analysis of the outer membrane proteins of this isolate revealed that it lacked a porin of 42 kDa. The loss of this outer membrane protein band correlated with imipenem resistance in this strain. In K. pneumoniae 16137, synthesis of a plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase: AmpC CMY-4, together with alteration in permeability led to resistance to all available beta-lactams and carbapenems.
