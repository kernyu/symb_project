The increasing resistance to antibacterials commonly employed in the clinic and the growth of multidrug resistant strains suggest that the development of new therapeutic approaches should be of primary concern. In this context, EPIs may restore life to old drugs. In the present work, the EPI activity of the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib was confirmed and a new class of pyrazolo[4,3-c][1,2]benzothiazine 5,5-dioxide analogues acting as inhibitors of the Staphylococcus aureus NorA multidrug efflux pump was identified.
