OBJECTIVE: Although adipose tissue hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and its metabolizing enzymes have been linked to obesity and insulin resistance in animal studies, this relation remains to be evaluated in humans. METHODS: Non-diabetic men (N = 43, median age, 49 (37, 54 y)) undergoing abdominal surgeries were studied. Participants were classified by body mass index (BMI) into normal-weight (N = 19), or overweight/obese (Ow/Ob; BMI >/=25; N = 24). Centrally obese men were identified by waist-height ratio >/=0.5. H2O2 and activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase enzymes were assayed in subcutaneous fat samples, and visceral fat (available from N = 33), and their associations with anthropometric parameters, fasting serum lipids, and the homeostasis model of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were tested using correlations and multivariate linear regression. RESULTS: H2O2 concentrations and catalase activity were increased in visceral fat from Ow/Ob men, compared to normal-weight subjects (+32%, P = 0.038 and +51%, P = 0.043 respectively). Centrally obese subjects had >2-fold higher superoxide dismutase activity (P = 0.005), 46% higher H2O2 (P = 0.028), and 89% higher catalase activity (P = 0.009) in visceral fat, compared to lean subjects. Central obesity did not alter these markers in subcutaneous fat, apart from a 50% increase in catalase, and did not affect glutathione peroxidase in either fat depot. H2O2 in visceral fat positively correlated with insulin resistance (r = 0.40, P = 0.032). Catalase activity in visceral fat was an independent determinant of HOMA-IR, explaining ~18% of the variance (ss = 0.42, P = 0.016), after adjustment for age and BMI. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that adipose tissue catalase shows compensatory up-regulation in response to obesity-induced H2O2 accumulation, and that perturbed H2O2 metabolism in visceral fat is linked to insulin resistance in obese humans.
