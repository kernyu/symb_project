The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence and effect of anti-tuberculosis treatment on anti-phospholipid antibodies and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmatic antibodies (ANCA) in patients with active mycobacterial infections. Thirty-three consecutive patients (age 56 years, 26 males) with recently diagnosed active tuberculosis (TB) were enrolled. Data included clinical disease features, symptom duration, multidrug resistance and presence of HIV. Serum samples taken before and after TB treatment were frozen at -20 degrees C and tested for anti-cardiolipin IgG (aCL), anti-beta2 glycoprotein IgG (anti-beta2GPI), anti-prothrombin, anti-proteinase 3 (PR3), myeloperoxidase (MPO), bactericidal/permeability (BPI) and lactoferrin. Thirty percent of patients had higher than cut-off value for anti-beta2GPI, and 9 % had increased aCL. The levels of antibodies against beta2GPI and aCL normalized post-treatment. A substantial proportion of patients had high baseline anti-PR3, MPO, BPI and lactoferrin levels. Most anti-lactoferrin and anti-MPO levels decreased post-treatment, while anti-PR3 increased in most of the baseline-positive patients. Some patients had de novo anti-PR3 and MPO formation after 6-month treatment. Patients with active TB have significantly increased anti-beta2GPI and ANCA titers. While anti-beta2GPI titers normalize post-treatment, ANCA behave in a complex way. Anti-TB treatment may induce normalization of anti-lactoferrin and anti-MPO, and de novo anti-PR3 and MPO formation.
