Antibiotics disrupt the intestinal microbiota, rendering patients vulnerable to colonization by exogenous pathogens. Intermicrobial interactions may attenuate this effect. Incubation with ceftriaxone-resistant, ccrA-positive, beta-lactamase-producing Bacteroides strains raised the minimum bactericidal concentration of ceftriaxone required to kill a susceptible Escherichia coli strain (mean change, <0.25 to 29 mg/liter; P = 0.009); incubation with ceftriaxone-resistant but non-beta-lactamase-producing Bacteroides strains had no effect. The production of beta-lactamase by common members of the intestinal microbiota (Bacteroides) can protect susceptible fellow commensals from beta-lactams.
