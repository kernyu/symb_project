Metallo-beta-lactamases can hydrolyze and deactivate lactam-containing antibiotics, which is the major mechanism for causing drug resistance in the treatment of bacterial infections. This has become a global concern because of the lack of clinically approved inhibitors so far. The emergence of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase I (NDM-1) makes the situation even more serious. In this work, first, the structure of NDM-1 in complex with the inhibitor molecule l-captopril is investigated by both density functional theory (DFT) and hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methods, and the theoretical results are in good agreement with the X-ray structure. The Michaelis structure with an antibiotic compound (ampicillin) bound in the active site is constructed from a recent X-ray structure of the NDM-1 enzyme with hydrolyzed ampicillin. It is further simulated using a QM/MM molecular dynamics method. One of the interesting binding features of ampicillin in the NDM-1 active site is that the conserved C3 carboxylate group is not ligated with Zn2 but rather is only hydrogen-bonded with N220 and K211. A bridging hydroxide ion is suggested to connect two zinc cofactors. This hydroxide ion is also hydrogen-bonded with D124. Subsequent reaction path calculations indicate that the initial step of lactam ring-opening occurs through a concerted step in which the cleavage of the C-N bond and the transfer of the hydrogen bond to D124 are nearly concerted. The ligand bond between Zn2 and the C3 carboxylate group forms after the first step of nucleophilic addition. The calculated activation energy barrier height is about 19.4 kcal/mol for the hydrolysis of ampicillin, which can be compared with the experimental value of 15.8 kcal/mol derived from kcat = 15 s(-1). The overall mechanism is finally confirmed by a subsequent DFT study of a truncated active-site model.
