Elacytarabine (formerly CP-4055) is a lipid-conjugated derivative of the nucleoside analog cytarabine. Elacytarabine was rationally designed to circumvent cytarabine resistance related to decreased cellular uptake, due to the ability of the lipophilic drug moiety to enter the cell without the requirement of specialized nuclear transport proteins, including the hENT1. In preclinical and clinical studies, elacytarabine has demonstrated both safety and efficacy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), with noteworthy activity among the cytarabine-refractory AML population. Elacytarabine was granted orphan drug designation status from the European Commission in 2007 and from the US FDA in 2008, with a fast-track approval designation from the FDA in 2010. Results of a recent randomized Phase III clinical trial, however, failed to show superiority of elacytarabine over the investigator's choice of therapy for relapsed or refractory AML.
