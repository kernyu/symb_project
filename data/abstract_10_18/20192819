Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates harboring KPC-(178 strains) or CTX-M-encoding (67 strains) genes were collected during surveillance programs in the 2000-2007 period; and susceptibility was tested by broth microdilution methods. Organisms were dominantly collected in U.S. hospitals (93%). CTX-M-15 and -14 were the most prevalent CTX-M types (97%), all collected from the United States. KPC producers were isolated in the United States (160/178), Israel, China, and Argentina. bla(CTX-M)-carrying isolates were 95.5 and 98.5%, susceptible to Imipenem and meropenem respectively, and were all susceptible to tigecycline, whereas KPC-producing isolates were highly resistant to all antimicrobials tested except polymyxin B and tigecycline (90.6% and 99.4% susceptibility, respectively). The occurrence of KPC-producing and CTX-M-producing isolates has rapidly increased especially in U.S. hospitals, and expanded therapeutic options are needed to treat infections caused by these emerging organisms.
