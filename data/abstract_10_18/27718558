Given that resistance to all drugs in clinical use has arisen, discovery of new antimalarial drug targets is eagerly anticipated. The Plasmodium mitochondrion has been considered a promising drug target largely based on its significant divergence from the host organelle as well as its involvement in ATP production and pyrimidine biosynthesis. However, the functions of Plasmodium mitochondrial protein complexes and associated metabolic pathways are not fully characterized. Here, we report the development of novel and robust bioenergetic assay protocols for Plasmodium falciparum asexual parasites utilizing a Seahorse Bioscience XFe24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer. These protocols allowed us to simultaneously assess the direct effects of metabolites and inhibitors on mitochondrial respiration and glycolytic activity in real-time with the readout of oxygen consumption rate and extracellular acidification rate. Using saponin-freed parasites at the schizont stage, we found that succinate, malate, glycerol-3-phosphate, and glutamate, but not pyruvate, were able to increase the oxygen consumption rate and that glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase had the largest potential as an electron donor among tested mitochondrial dehydrogenases. Furthermore, we revealed the presence of a glucose-regulated metabolic shift between oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis. We measured proton leak and reserve capacity and found bioenergetic evidence for oxidative phosphorylation in erythrocytic stage parasites but at a level much lower than that observed in mammalian cells. Lastly, we developed an assay platform for target identification and mode of action studies of mitochondria-targeting antimalarials. This study provides new insights into the bioenergetics and metabolomics of the Plasmodium mitochondria.
