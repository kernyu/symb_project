Although the role of pets in household transmission of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been examined previously, only minor attention has been given to the role of the abiotic household environment independent of, or in combination with, colonisation of pets and human beings to maintain transmission cycles of MRSA within the household. This report reviews published work about household transmission of S aureus and other staphylococci and describes contamination of household environmental surfaces and colonisation of pets and people. Household microbial communities might have a role in transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes and could be reservoirs for recolonisation of people, although additional research is needed regarding strategies for decontamination of household environments. Household-based interventions should be developed to control recurrent S aureus infections in the community, and coordination between medical and veterinary providers could be beneficial.
