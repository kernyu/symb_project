Hepcidin is the major central regulator of iron metabolism, controlling iron absorption and mobilization. Considering its interaction with several factors that are altered in chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly in hyporesponsive CKD patients under therapy with high recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) doses, it was aimed to study the impact of increasing rHuEPO doses on the regulation of iron-hepcidin metabolism. The blood, cellular, and tissue studies, using the remnant kidney rat model of CKD induced by 5/6 nephrectomy, under rHuEPO (100, 200, 400, and 600 IU/Kg body weight [BW]/week) treatment during 3 weeks were performed. It was found that the rHuEPO stimulus triggered a first wave to achieve correction of anemia, by inhibiting hepcidin synthesis, favoring erythropoiesis and iron absorption; this continuous stimulus enhanced iron absorption leading to iron overload, as showed by the hepatic iron deposits found in rats treated with higher rHuEPO dose that seems to trigger the upregulation of hepcidin synthesis through the activation of the BMP6/SMAD pathway. The data suggested that liver iron overload was an important stimuli for hepcidin synthesis, stronger than the inhibitory effect of high rHuEPO doses; moreover, the findings raised the hypothesis that when high inflammation (triggering hepcidin expression) was associated with increased iron stores in hemodialysis patients, hepcidin expression was also upregulated via BMP6, enhancing hepcidin synthesis, leading, therefore, to worsening of anemia and, eventually, to a hyporesponse/resistance to rHuEPO therapy.
