A Klebsiella pneumoniae strain of sequence type 313 (ST313) recovered from hospital sewage was found carrying the plasmid-borne colistin resistance gene mcr-1, which was bracketed by two copies of the insertion sequence ISApl1 on a 57-kb self-transmissible IncP-type plasmid of a new IncP-1 clade. The carriage of mcr-1 on a self-transmissible broad-host-range plasmid highlights that mcr-1 has the potential to spread beyond the Enterobacteriaceae family.
