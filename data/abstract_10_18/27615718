OBJECTIVES: In November 2015, a plasmid-mediated colistin resistance, MCR-1, was described in animals, food and humans in China, and it was considered as a potential emerging threat to public health. Therefore, we screened for the mcr-1 gene a European collection of colistin-resistant Escherichia coli (n=218) and Salmonella spp. (n=74) isolated from diseased food-producing animals between 2004 and 2014 and characterized the mcr-1-positive clones. METHODS: Screening for mcr-1 gene was performed by PCR on isolates for which inhibition diameter was <15 mm around a 50 mug disk of colistin. Positive E. coli isolates were then characterized by phylogrouping, multilocus sequence typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by disk diffusion testing or by broth microdilution. RESULTS: Among the collection, 42 E. coli and three Salmonella spp. were positive for mcr-1, with continuous detection since 2004 mainly from bovine and swine digestive infections. Most of the mcr-1-positive strains were resistant to amoxicillin and cotrimoxazole but remained susceptible to cephalosporins, carbapenems and piperacillin/tazobactam. All but one isolate were resistant to colistin, with a minimum inhibitory concentration of >2 mg/L. Most of the mcr-1-positive E. coli belonged to the phylogroup A with two prevalent clonal complexes, CC10 and CC165, in which sequence type 10 and sequence type 100 were overrepresented and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing revealed a high diversity of pulsotypes. CONCLUSIONS: MCR-1 was detected yearly in European food-producing animal since 2004 with a high diversity of pulsotypes supporting the dissemination of mcr-1 via plasmids.
