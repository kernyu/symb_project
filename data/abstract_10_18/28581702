We provide a facile and scalable strategy for preparing gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)-based antibacterial coating on a variety of surfaces through electrostatic self-assembly. AuNPs conjugated with 4,6-diamino-2-pyrimidinethiol (DAPT, not antibacterial by itself), AuDAPT, can form stable coating on different substrates made from polyethylene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), and SiO2 in one step. Such a coating can efficiently eradicate pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria and even multidrug-resistant (MDR) mutants without causing any side-effect such as cytotoxicity, hemolysis, coagulation, and inflammation. We show that immobilized AuDAPT, instead of AuDAPT released from the substrate, is responsible for killing the bacteria and that the antimicrobial components do not enter into the environment to cause secondary contamination to breed drug resistance. Advantages for such coating include applicability on a broad range of surfaces, low cost, stability, high antibacterial efficiency, good biocompatibility, and low risk in antibiotics pollution; these advantages may be particularly helpful in preventing infections that involve medical devices.
