The impact of vanB vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteraemia on length of stay (LOS) in hospital, after adjusting for the time-varying nature of enterococcal bacteraemia (variable onset of bacteraemia post-admission), is unknown. Survival analyses (time-varying Cox and competing risks regression) were performed on vanB VRE bacteraemia patients, matched 1:1 with vancomycin-susceptible enterococci bacteraemia patients to determine the factors associated with LOS in these patients. In Cox regression analysis, vanB VRE bacteraemia, intensive-care-unit admission, Charlson co-morbidity index score 4, and an increase in the time to receive appropriate antibiotics were associated with prolonged LOS. Competing risks regression which accounts for the influence of in-patient mortality on the ability to observe the event discharge alive from hospital suggests that, vanB VRE bacteraemia was not significantly associated with prolonged LOS. For the first time, the rate of discharge from hospital in patients with vanB VRE bacteraemia has been quantified.
