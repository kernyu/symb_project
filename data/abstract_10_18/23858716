OBJECTIVE: From oral cavity we isolated and characterized probiotic lactobacilli that could probability be applied to therapy and prevention of oral diseases. METHODS: Lactobacillus strains were isolated by plating the saliva and dental plaque of healthy donors on selective medium. Then the target strains were tested for inhibiting the growth of a Streptococcus mutans strain belonging to cariogenic pathogen species. Other properties such as production of extracellular polysaccharide and resistance to the antibacterial substances were also investigated. RESULTS: Lactobacillus fermentum Y29, a strain with antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans, was obtained from dental plaque. This strain was an extracellular polysaccharide producer, which corresponds to its aggregation ability. Moreover, L. fermentum Y29 showed resistance to 1.0 mg/mL lysozyme and 140 microg/g hydrogen peroxide that may guarantee its persistence in the complex oral niche. CONCLUSION: Probiotic properties were characterized of an oral isolate L. fermentum Y29, which provided a possibility for its application in prevention and treatment of oral diseases.
