Helicobacter pylori is one of the most commonly seen bacterium worldwide. It's in the etiology of multiple gastrointestinal diseases, ranging from gastritis to gastric carcinoma. The antimicrobial therapies, which are frequently prescribed empirically, are losing their effectivity as a result of the increasing antimicrobial resistance. As the standard triple therapy is now left especially in areas with high-clarithromycin resistance due to decreased eradication rates, quadruple therapies are recommended in most regions of the world. Alternatively, concomitant, sequential and hybrid therapies are used. There is still a debate going on about the use of levofloxacin-based therapy in order to prevent the increase in quinolone resistance. If no regimen can achieve the desired eradication rate, culture-guided individualized therapies are highly recommended. Probiotics, statins and n-acetylcysteine are helpful as adjuvant therapies in order to increase the effectiveness of the eradication therapy. Herein, we focused on different eradication regimens in order to highlight the current Helicobacter pylori treatment.
