High-level pan-azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus was recovered from four patients with chronic lung disease. In one patient, the development of progressive resistance followed long-term azole therapy and switching between antifungal azoles. The high-level pan-azole-resistant phenotypes were not associated with a specific cyp51A gene mutation. New strategies that avoid the development of progressive azole resistance are needed.
