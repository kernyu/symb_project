The Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) provides an annual international forum for basic scientists and clinical and global health researchers to present and become current on the most recent advances in the field of HIV and AIDS research. The 18th conference contained a number of strong basic science sessions. HIV-1 infection of the cell is opposed by cellular factors that attack the viral replication cycle at various points. However, the virus has evolved defenses against these innate cellular antiviral proteins. CROI continues to be a strong forum for presentation of the most recent developments in this area of research. In addition, there were numerous presentations on cellular factors that regulate virus-host cell interplay as well as on research that is providing detailed insight into the mechanism of action of integrase inhibitors. Some presentations focused on approaches to studying and intervening with viral latency, particularly in primary cell models. Research on the use of zinc-finger nucleases to knock out CC chemokine receptor R5 expression in CD34+ stem cells also received a lot of interest. The hope is that these strategies will provide new therapeutic approaches to generate resistance to HIV-1 infection.
