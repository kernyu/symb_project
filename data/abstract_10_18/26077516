To estimate the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drug resistance (DR) in a population of men who have sex with men (MSM) from Henan Province of China and to identify the DR-associated HIV-1 mutations in these MSM. The HIV-positive status of the MSM subjects in this study was confirmed using ELISA and Western blotting. The MSM subjects were classified into non-treatment group (n = 106) and treatment group (n = 313). CD4(+) T-lymphocyte counts were obtained by flow cytometry, and viral load was measured by branched DNA (bDNA) signal amplification assay. HIV-1 genotypic resistance tests were performed by sequence analysis of the HIV-1 protease and reverse transcriptase genes. In the non-treatment group, 15 patients (14.2 %) displayed DR to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). In the treatment group, the failure rate of viral suppression was 38.33 % and the DR rate was 33.2 %, which was higher than the rate observed in the non-treatment group (P < 0.05). The incidence of mutations corresponding to NNRTI resistance was significantly higher than the incidence of mutations corresponding to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) resistance (32.9 % vs. 26.5 %) in the cohort. After antiretroviral therapy (ART), the frequencies of K103N, G190A, Y181C, and V106A mutations were highly elevated. Logistic regression analysis results showed that duration of treatment, poor treatment compliance, drug abuse and homosexual orientation are the major risk factors for DR in this MSM population (all P < 0.05). Our results showed that DR-associated mutations in the HIV-1-infected MSM population increased significantly after ART. Furthermore, duration of treatment, poor treatment compliance, drug abuse and homosexual orientation were identified as the risk factors for DR in the MSM population from Henan Province in China.
