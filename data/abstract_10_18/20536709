AIM: To overcome fludioxonil resistance of Penicillium expansum, a mycotoxigenic fungal pathogen causing postharvest decay in apple, by using natural phenolic chemosensitizing agents. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fludioxonil-resistant mutants of P. expansum were co-treated with different oxidising and natural phenolic agents. Resistance was overcome by natural phenolic chemosensitizing agents targeting the oxidative stress-response pathway. These agents also augmented effectiveness of the fungicide, kresoxim-methyl. Results indicated that alkyl gallates target mitochondrial respiration and/or its antioxidation system. Fungal mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) plays a protective role against alkyl gallates. CONCLUSIONS: Natural chemosensitizing agents targeting the oxidative stress-response system, such as Mn-SOD, can synergize commercial fungicides. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Redox-active compounds can serve as potent chemosensitizing agents to overcome resistance and lower effective dosages of fungicides. This can reduce costs with coincidental lowering of environmental and health risks.
