Cytomegalovirus (CMV) strains resistant to ganciclovir, cidofovir and/or foscarnet were genotypically and phenotypically characterised in two haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients and three solid-organ transplant recipients with CMV disease. The anti-malaria drug artesunate led to a favourable virological and clinical response in three cases with mild CMV diseases (fever and neutropaenia) but was ineffective in two fatal CMV diseases with lung involvement in spite of a decrease in the CMV DNA load in blood and bronchoalveolar fluid.
