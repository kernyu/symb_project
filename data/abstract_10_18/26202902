BACKGROUND: Echinochloa colona is an important summer-growing weed species in cropping regions of northern Australia that has evolved resistance to glyphosate owing to intensive use of this herbicide in summer fallow. RESULTS: Pot trials conducted at 20 and 30 degrees C on six E. colona populations showed a significant increase in the level of glyphosate resistance in resistant populations at 30 degrees C compared with 20 degrees C. However, there was no influence of growth temperature on glyphosate susceptibility of the sensitive population. Sequencing of the target-site gene (EPSPS) of the six populations identified a mutation at position 106 leading to a change from proline to serine in the most resistant population A533.1 only. EPSPS gene amplification was not detected in any of the resistant populations examined. Examining (14) C-glyphosate uptake on two resistant and one susceptible population showed a twofold increase at 20 degrees C; however, few differences in glyphosate translocation occurred from the treated leaf to other plant parts between populations or temperatures. CONCLUSION: There is reduced efficacy of glyphosate at high temperatures on resistant E. colona populations, making these populations harder to control in summer.
