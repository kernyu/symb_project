OBJECTIVE: Pulmonary cavitation is the classic hallmark of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and is the site of very high mycobacterial burden associated with antimycobacterial drug resistance and treatment failure. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between re-treatment PTB and initial pulmonary cavitation coordinated with other clinical factors. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study of 291 newly diagnosed cases of pulmonary TB in The Infectious Hospital of Wuxi from Dec 2009 to Dec 2011 with complete follow-up information until December 31st of 2014. 68 patients were followed-up with PTB re-treatment; the rest of the PTB patients (n = 223) had completed anti-TB treatment, and cured without re-treatment were selected as controls. RESULTS: The univariate analysis [hazard ratio (HR) 1.885, 95 % CI 1.170-3.035, P = 0.009] and the multivariable analysis (HR 2.242, 95 % CI 1.294-3.882, P = 0.004) demonstrated that the initial pulmonary cavitation was a prognostic predictor for TB re-treatment. Additionally, the re-treatment rates in PTB patients with cavitation and no-cavitation were 27.1 and 15.5 %, respectively, with significant difference (log-rank test; P = 0.010). Other factors, age of >/=60 and history of smoking, were also prognostic variables. CONCLUSION: Initial pulmonary cavitation of chest X-ray was a significant predictor for PTB re-treatment.
