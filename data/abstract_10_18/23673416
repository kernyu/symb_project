AcrB is an inner membrane resistance-nodulation-cell division efflux pump and is part of the AcrAB-TolC tripartite efflux system. We have determined the crystal structure of AcrB with bound Linezolid at a resolution of 3.5 A. The structure shows that Linezolid binds to the A385/F386 loops of the symmetric trimer of AcrB. A conformational change of a loop in the bottom of the periplasmic cleft is also observed.
