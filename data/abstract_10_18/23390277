Among 594 Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 19A invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) isolates collected from 1993 to 2011, we identified 85 sequence types by multilocus sequence typing. CC320 was associated with multidrug resistance and reduced susceptibility to penicillin and ceftriaxone and still predominated among declining serotype 19A IPD isolates following PCV13 introduction.
