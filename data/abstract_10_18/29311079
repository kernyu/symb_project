Mosaic penA alleles have caused most of the cephalosporin resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, but their evolution is mostly unknown. The penA gene from Neisseria cinerea strain AM1601 (ceftriaxone MIC, 1.0 mug/ml) caused ceftriaxone resistance (MIC, 1 mug/ml) in a ceftriaxone-susceptible gonococcal strain. The 3'-terminal half of AM1601 penA was almost identical to that of the ceftriaxone-resistant gonococcal GU140106 and FC428 strains. N. cinerea can serve as a reservoir of ceftriaxone resistance-mediating penA sequences that can be transferred to gonococci.
