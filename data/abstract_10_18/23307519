The optimal dosage and administration of antibiotics are not only important measures to combat antimicrobial resistance, but they are also integral to antimicrobial stewardship. In light of a diminishing antibiotic pipeline and an alarming rise in resistance, the optimal dosage and administration of antimicrobial agents have been under a great deal of scrutiny. Prolonged infusions of beta-lactam antibiotics have been proposed as an alternate dosing strategy. To summarize the evidence on prolonged infusions of beta-lactam agents and provide their clinical implications for antimicrobial stewardship, we performed a MEDLINE search (1950-2011) of all relevant articles. This article provides a review of data from Monte Carlo simulations, clinical outcome analyses, and pharmacoeconomic studies. Furthermore, protocol implementation strategies are discussed to address antimicrobial stewardship.
