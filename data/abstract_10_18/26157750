BACKGROUND/AIMS: To determine the efficacies of entecavir (ETV) in nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA)-naive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients and in those with prior lamivudine (LAM) use who did not develop resistance. METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 337 patients with CHB who were treated with ETV (0.5 mg daily) for at least 30 months. The study included 270 (80.1%) NA-naive patients and 67 (19.9%) LAM-use patients. Ten of the LAM-use patients were refractory to LAM therapy without developing resistance. RESULTS: Genotypic resistance to ETV developed more frequently in the LAM-use group (13.1%) than in the NA-naive group (2.6%) at 60 months (P=0.009). In subgroup analysis, after excluding the 10 patients who were refractory to LAM therapy, the cumulative probability of ETV resistance did not differ significantly between the two groups (P=0.149). Prior LAM refractoriness and a higher hepatitis B virus DNA level at month 12 were independent predictive factors for the development of ETV resistance. CONCLUSIONS: ETV resistance developed more frequently in LAM-use patients with CHB. However, prior LAM use without refractoriness did not affect the development of ETV resistance. The serum hepatitis B virus DNA level at month 12 was a major predictor for the development of ETV resistance.
