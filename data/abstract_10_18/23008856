Doxycycline gel is licensed for the treatment of periodontal disease in dogs. Package labeling indicates the product is stable after reconstitution of antibiotic with polymer gel for up to 3-days when stored at room temperature. The purpose of this study was to determine if reconstituted doxycycline gel retained antimicrobial activity for greater than 3-days. The antibiotic activity of reconstituted doxycycline gel was evaluated against antimicrobial testing strains of bacteria and bacteria collected from throat swabs of 2 dogs using a standard disc diffusion assay. Our results showed that reconstituted doxycycline gel retained undiminished antimicrobial activity for a minimum of 8-weeks.
