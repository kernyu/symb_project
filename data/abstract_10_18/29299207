Objectives: Antibiotic resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii and outbreaks caused by this organism have been reported from several areas of the world. The present study aimed at determining the antibiotic susceptibility profiles and the distribution of OXA-type beta-lactamases among Iranian Acinetobacter baumannii isolates from Qom of Iran. Materials and Methods: For this study, 108 non-duplicate A. baumannii isolates were obtained from clinical specimens in four teaching hospitals in Qom in the central of Iran. The antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates was tested by standard disk diffusion and prevalence of bla OXA genes was investigated by PCR method. Results: Among 97 carbapenem non-susceptible isolates of A. baumannii, 90.72% (88 isolates) isolates showed extensive drug resistance to multiple antibiotics. Among carbapenem resistant isolates, 100% carried blaOXA-51-like, 82.47% carried blaOXA-23-like, 55.67% carried blaOXA-58-like, 22.68% carried blaOXA-40-like and 14.43% had blaOXA-143-like resistance genes. Conclusion: This study demonstrated high genetic diversity of OXA genes among isolates of A. baumannii in Qom, Iran.
