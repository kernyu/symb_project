Seven new lanostane-type triterpenes, hypocrellols A-G (1-7), and six new hopane-type triterpenes, 7beta,15alpha-dihydroxy-22(29)-hopene (8), 3beta,7beta-dihydroxy-22(29)-hopene (9), 3beta-acetoxy-15alpha-hydroxy-22(29)-hopene (10), 3beta,7beta,15alpha,22-tetrahydroxyhopane (11), 3beta-acetoxy-7beta,15alpha,22-trihydroxyhopane (12), and 7beta,15alpha,22-trihydroxyhopane (13), were isolated from the scale insect pathogenic fungus Hypocrella sp. BCC 14524. The structures of the new compounds were elucidated by analyses of the NMR spectroscopic and mass spectrometry data. The structure of 1 was confirmed by X-ray crystallography.
