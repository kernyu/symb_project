OBJECTIVE: To develop a high-resolution melting curve analysis (HRM) assay for detection of PZA resistance. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Thirty samples of PZA-susceptible M. tuberculosis and eight isolates of PZA-resistant M. tuberculosis were included in the experiment. Five sets of primers were designed to cover the pncA gene and its upstream nucleotides. The pncA gene fragments were amplified by the PCR method. Determination of pncA mutation in the sample by comparing their melting behavior of the PCR products with the M. tuberculosis wild type by using Gene scanning software of the LightCycler 480 instrument. RESULTS: Mutations were clearly detected in all PZA resistant samples by the HRM, whereas all PZA susceptible samples showed no mutation in the pncA gene. Results were concordant with the drug susceptibility testing by using BACTEC MGIT 960 PZA kit and mutation detection by the DNA sequencing method. CONCLUSION: This HRM method offers a rapid and reliable screen for PZA resistant M. tuberculosis.
