Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has been broadly used to provide detailed characterization of foodborne pathogens. These genomes for diverse species including Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Listeria, Campylobacter and Vibrio have provided great insight into the genetic make-up of these pathogens. Numerous government agencies, industry and academia have developed new applications in food safety using WGS approaches such as outbreak detection and characterization, source tracking, determining the root cause of a contamination event, profiling of virulence and pathogenicity attributes, antimicrobial resistance monitoring, quality assurance for microbiology testing, as well as many others. The future looks bright for additional applications that come with the new technologies and tools in genomics and metagenomics.
