BACKGROUND AND AIM: Interferon (IFN) lambda plays an important role in innate immunity to protect against hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near IL28B (IFNlambda3) are strongly associated with treatment response to IFNalpha therapy in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients. Recently, IFNlambda4 related to IL28B-unfavorable allele was discovered. However, the impact of IFNlambdas on CHC is unknown. We aimed to investigate the mechanism underlying responsiveness to IFN-based therapy in CHC associated with SNPs near IL28B. METHODS: We evaluated the basal mRNA levels and ex-vivo induction of IFNlambda expression including IFNlambda4 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 50 CHC patients treated with pegylated-IFNalpha/RBV. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of IFNlambda4 on induction of IL28B in vitro. RESULTS: When PBMCs were stimulated with IFNalpha and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, IL28B induction was significantly lower in patients with IL28B-unfavorable genotype (rs12979860 CT/TT) than those with IL28B-favorable genotype (rs12979860 CC; P=0.049). IL28B induction was lower in nonresponders than in relapsers (P = 0.04), and it was also lower in nonsustained virological responder patients for triple therapy including NS3 protease inhibitors. IFNlambda4 mRNA was detected in 12 of 26 patients with IL28B-unfavorable SNP, and IFNlambda4 expression was associated with lower IL28B induction in patients with IL28B-unfavorable genotype (P=0.04) and nonresponse to IFNalpha therapy (P=0.003). Overexpression of IFNlambda4 suppressed IL28B induction and promoter activation. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired induction of IL28B, related to IFNlambda4 expression in PBMCs of IL28B-unfavorable patients, is associated with nonresponse to IFNalpha-based therapy for hepatitis C viral infection.
