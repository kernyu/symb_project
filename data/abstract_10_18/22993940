Prosthetic joints infection is a serious medical, social and financial problem. Significant achievements in prophylaxis of such infections are well known. In cases of primary endoprosthetics of large joints, the frequency of infection in the leading world clinics is 0.5-2%. However, the approaches to the treatment of such infections are different especially with respect to the antibacterial therapy: choice of drugs, administration routes, treatment course and discontinuation. Under conditions of global growth of resistance in nosocomial pathogens, the choice of antimicrobials requires consideration not only of the formal susceptibility criteria, but also of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic indices.
