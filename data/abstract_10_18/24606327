Fungal infections are a major challenge to human health that is heightened by pathogen resistance to current therapeutic agents. Previously, we were inspired by host-defense peptides to develop nylon-3 polymers (poly-beta-peptides) that are toxic toward the fungal pathogen Candida albicans but exert little effect on mammalian cells. Based on subsequent analysis of structure-activity relationships among antifungal nylon-3 polymers, we have now identified readily prepared cationic homopolymers active against strains of C. albicans that are resistant to the antifungal drugs fluconazole and amphotericin B. These nylon-3 polymers are nonhemolytic. In addition, we have identified cationic-hydrophobic copolymers that are highly active against a second fungal pathogen, Cryptococcus neoformans, and moderately active against a third pathogen, Aspergillus fumigatus.
