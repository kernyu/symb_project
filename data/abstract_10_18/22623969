The emergence and prevalence of high-level mupirocin-resistant, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MuH MRSA) is challenging the eradication of MRSA nasal carriage and the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections. To understand the potentially pathogenetic capacity and the genetic basis of MuH MRSA, it is important to have a detailed knowledge of the molecular traits of this organism. Fifty three MuH MRSA isolates were gathered from Shanghai (28 isolates) and Wenzhou (25 isolates) in China. These isolates, consisting of 27 different PFGE-SCCmec-spa patterns, were examined by PCR for 35 virulence genes and further typed using agr (accessory gene regulator) typing and MLST (multilocus sequence typing). All 53 strains were positive for the genes hlg/hlg variant and icaD, and negative for seb, sed, see, seh, eta, etb, hld, cap-5, and ACME-arcA. Compared with Wenzhou isolates, Shanghai isolates were more likely to carry seg (P = 0.002) and several other genes which were not found in Wenzhou strains such as sec, sei, tst (P<0.001 each), and pvl (P = 0.012), and less likely to contain sea (P<0.001), cna (P = 0.031), and efb (P = 0.045). MLST and agr typing showed that ST239-agr1, ST5-agr1, and ST239-agr2 were the common lineages in MuH MRSA isolates from these two different regions. Our results indicated that MuH MRSA strains from two different geographic regions of China have differences in distribution of some virulence genes, while their major MLST-agr genetic backgrounds were accordant.
