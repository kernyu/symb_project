BACKGROUND: Secondary peritonitis is a common surgical emergence with deadly outcomes when not timely and promptly intervened. The emergence of Extended spectrum beta lactamase producing bacteria (ESBL) poses treatment challenge at Bugando Medical Centre (BMC); hence a need to evaluate the magnitude of ESBL so as to guide specific therapy. METHODS: This was a cross sectional study conducted at BMC from May 2014 to April 2015 involving patients with secondary peritonitis. A questionnaire was used to collect patients' information. Peritoneal aspirate sample was collected intra-operatively and processed using standard operating procedures to identify bacteria species and their susceptibility profiles. RESULTS: The study involved 97 patients with the median age (IQR) of 32 (21-47) years, males were 62 (63.9 %) and about 27 (27.8 %) patients had co-morbid illnesses. The prevalence of ESBL among patients with secondary peritonitis was 23.7 % (23/97). Of 53 gram negative Enterobacteriaceae isolated, 47.2 % (25/53) were ESBL producers, with predominance of Escherichia coli 7 (28.0 %) and Klebsiella spp 5 (20.0 %). The ESBL isolates exhibited more resistance rates to trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin compared to non ESBL isolates 96.0 % versus 60.7 %, p value = 0.003 and 16.0 % versus 0.0 %, p value = 0.043 respectively). All isolates were sensitive to meropenem. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of ESBL among patients with secondary peritonitis at BMC is high; with more resistance rates among ESBL compared to non ESBL isolates. There is a need for strengthen ESBL surveillance in this setting so as to guide specific therapy.
