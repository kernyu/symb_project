The emergence and spread of carbapenemase-producing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CP-CRE) are a significant clinical and public health concern. Reliable detection of CP-CRE is the first step in combating this problem. There are both phenotypic and molecular methods available for CP-CRE detection. There is no single detection method that is ideal for all situations.
