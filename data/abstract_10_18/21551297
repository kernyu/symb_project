We report the annotated draft genome sequences of four serotype 6C Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates of differing genetic backgrounds. Serotype 6C isolates are increasing in prevalence and becoming progressively more resistant to antibiotics. As a result, these strains are likely to become more important in the near future.
