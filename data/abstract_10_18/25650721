Macrocycles possess desirable properties that make them promising candidates for the discovery of novel drugs. They present structural features to favor bioactive conformations, selectivity to the receptors, cell permeability and metabolic stability. More effective and nontoxic drugs to cure human African trypanosomiasis, Leishmaniasis and Chagas disease are needed, especially because resistance has been detected. Therefore, major efforts should be made for investigation in new bioactive compounds exhibiting different mechanisms of action. Macrocycles might fulfill the expectations for the development of new drugs to treat those diseases. In the current review, we focus on macrocycles exhibiting biological activities as antitrypanosomal and/or antileishmanial. The isolation, synthetic and biological studies of this class of compounds published from 2005 to 2014 are summarized.
