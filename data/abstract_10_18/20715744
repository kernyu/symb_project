Clostridium difficile infection is an emerging and often difficult-to-treat iatrogenic complication. Recent data suggest that tigecycline, a novel antibiotic with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, can be used successfully to treat patients with severe Clostridium difficile infection. We report a 70-year-old man who developed severe Clostridium difficile infection, was admitted to the intensive care unit and eventually succumbed to complications of his illness despite receiving tigecycline for approximately three weeks in combination with vancomycin, metronidazole and intravenous immunoglobulin. Additionally, we discuss the unique challenges that emerged during tigecycline treatment, such as the development of Proteus mirabilis bacteraemia and of colonisation with Acinetobacter baumannii resistant to tigecycline. Finally, we review data on other cases reported in the medical literature. Even though tigecycline looks promising for the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection, we urge caution against its indiscriminate use for off label indications.
