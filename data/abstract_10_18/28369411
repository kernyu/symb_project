We assessed the broadly used, off-label combination of sofosbuvir, daclatasvir, simeprevir, and ribavirin in direct-acting antiviral-experienced patients, as recommended in current guidelines despite scarce data. After 24 weeks' treatment, sustained virological response 12 weeks after the end of treatment was achieved in 6 patients (60%). Two cirrhotic patients relapsed and 2 discontinued treatment due to serious adverse events.
