INTRODUCTION: Overuse of antibiotics has contributed to the development of organism resistance. The acquisition of antibiotics without prescription by the general population seems to be common practice in pharmacies of Damascus, Syria. This study aimed to determine the proportion of pharmacies dispensing antibiotics without medical prescription and without seeing the patient. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional study involving a sample of 224 pharmacies was conducted in Damascus. To obtain antibiotics without medical prescription, the investigators posed as individuals who had a sister with symptoms of sinusitis. RESULTS: From 200 pharmacies visited, 87% agreed without insistence from the investigator to sell antibiotics without prescription. This figure increased to 97% when the investigators who were at first denied antibiotics insisted on having the antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Dispensing of antibiotics is high in Damascus despite federal regulations. Health education programs should be directed to pharmacies and also to the population.
