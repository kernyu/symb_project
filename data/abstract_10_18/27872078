Safe and effective therapies are urgently needed to treat polymyxin-resistant KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae infections and suppress the emergence of resistance. We investigated the pharmacodynamics of polymyxin B, rifampin, and meropenem alone and as polymyxin B-based double and triple combinations against KPC-producing K. pneumoniae isolates. The rates and extents of killing with polymyxin B (1 to 128 mg/liter), rifampin (2 to 16 mg/liter), and meropenem (10 to 120 mg/liter) were evaluated against polymyxin B-susceptible (PB(s)) and polymyxin B-resistant (PB(r)) clinical isolates using 48-h static time-kill studies. Additionally, humanized triple-drug regimens of polymyxin B (concentration at steady state [Css] values of 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/liter), 600 mg rifampin every 12 or 8 h, and 1 or 2 g meropenem every 8 h dosed as an extended 3-h infusion were simulated over 48 h by using a one-compartment in vitro dynamic infection model. Serial bacterial counts were performed to quantify the pharmacodynamic effect. Population analysis profiles (PAPs) were used to assess the emergence of polymyxin B resistance. Monotherapy was ineffective against both isolates. Polymyxin B with rifampin demonstrated early bactericidal activity against the PB(s) isolate, followed by regrowth by 48 h. Bactericidal activity was sustained at all polymyxin B concentrations of >/=2 mg/liter in combination with meropenem. No two-drug combinations were effective against the PB(r) isolate, but all simulated triple-drug regimens showed early bactericidal activity against both strains by 8 h that was sustained over 48 h. PAPs did not reveal the emergence of resistant subpopulations. The triple-drug combination of polymyxin B, rifampin, and meropenem may be a viable consideration for the treatment of PB(r) KPC-producing K. pneumoniae infections. Further investigation is warranted to optimize triple-combination therapy.
