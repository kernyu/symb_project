Cyclopropavir (CPV) is a promising antiviral drug against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). As with ganciclovir (GCV), the current standard for HCMV treatment, activation of CPV requires multiple steps of phosphorylation and is enantioselective. We hypothesized that the resulting CPV triphosphate (CPV-TP) would stereoselectively target HCMV DNA polymerase and terminate DNA synthesis. To test this hypothesis, we synthesized both enantiomers of CPV-TP [(+) and (-)] and investigated their action on HCMV polymerase. Both enantiomers inhibited HCMV polymerase competitively with dGTP, with (+)-CPV-TP exhibiting a more than 20-fold lower apparent Ki than (-)-CPV-TP. Moreover, (+)-CPV-TP was a more potent inhibitor than GCV-TP. (+)-CPV-TP also exhibited substantially lower apparent Km and somewhat higher apparent kcat values than (-)-CPV-TP and GCV-TP for incorporation into DNA by the viral polymerase. As is the case for GCV-TP, both CPV-TP enantiomers behaved as nonobligate chain terminators, with the polymerase terminating DNA synthesis after incorporation of one additional nucleotide. These results elucidate how CPV-TP acts on HCMV DNA polymerase and help explain why CPV is more potent against HCMV replication than GCV.
