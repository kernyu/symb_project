An observational study determined the normal fecal bacterial flora of clinically healthy bison, detected the presence of common potential zoonotic pathogens, and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of isolated E. coli strains. Ninety-six fecal samples from 10 captive herds were cultured for aerobic, anaerobic, facultative, and microaerophillic bacteria. Nineteen major genera of gram-positive and 8 genera of gram-negative bacteria were identified. Salmonella spp. were not detected but some of the isolated bacteria are potential gastrointestinal pathogens. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 24 antimicrobials were determined for the E. coli isolated. Nearly all were susceptible to 23 of the 24 antimicrobials but there was a reduced susceptibility to sulphonamide. There were fewer resistant strains than were reported in recent studies of generic E. coli from cattle living in the same area.
