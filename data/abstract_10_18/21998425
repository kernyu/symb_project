The emergence and spread of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) producing acquired carbapenemases have created a global public health crisis. In the United States, CRE producing the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) are increasingly common and are endemic in some regions. Metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing CRE have recently been reported in the United States among patients who received medical care in countries where such organisms are common. Here, we describe three carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates recovered from pediatric patients at a single U.S. health care facility, none of whom had a history of international travel. The isolates were resistant to carbapenems but susceptible to aztreonam, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fluoroquinolones. The three isolates were closely related to each other by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and contained a common plasmid. PCR and sequence analysis confirmed that these isolates produce IMP-4, an MBL carbapenemase not previously published as present among Enterobacteriaceae in the United States.
