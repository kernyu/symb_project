The chemotherapy of tuberculous lymphadenopthy, the commonest form of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis, is reviewed and a recommendation made for the treatment of this condition in children. Fifteen papers were identified recording the treatment and follow-up of 1133 adults and children with six-month isoniazid and rifampicin based regimens. In 32 (2.8%) cases treatment was recommenced, but in only one case was relapse microbiologically confirmed and in a further four histology was compatible with tuberculosis. Four studies enrolling 484 adults and children, record the follow-up of patients receiving 6-18 months treatment with INH and RMP based regimens; treatment was recommenced in 24 (5%), but in no case was relapse confirmed microbiologically. Five papers describe the treatment and follow-up of 246 adults and children receiving nine-month INH and RMP based regimens and record the recommencement of treatment in 4 (1.6%) cases, but in no case was relapse confirmed microbiologically. Four controlled studies failed to show any advantage for treatment regimens longer than six months. Paradoxical recurrence and worsening of clinical features was common during and following all regimens being recorded in from 3 to 20% of patients. Very seldom were these events accompanied by evidence of culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to confirm microbiological failure to respond or relapse. Tuberculous lymphadenopathy in children can be safely treated with six months of INH and RMP with PZA given for the first two months and accompanied by EMB in areas with a high prevalence of drug resistance. Every effort should be made to confirm the diagnosis and possible relapses microbiologically.
