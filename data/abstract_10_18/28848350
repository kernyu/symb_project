As an effective antiviral agent, the clinical application of oseltamivir (OTV) is limited by the appearance of drug-resistant viruses. Due to their low toxicity and excellent activity, the antiviral capabilities of selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) has attracted increasing attention in recent years. To overcome the limitation of drug resistance, the use of modified NPs with biologics to explore novel anti-influenza drugs is developing rapidly. In this study, OTV surface-modified SeNPs with superior antiviral properties and restriction on drug resistance were synthesized. OTV decoration of SeNPs (Se@OTV) obviously inhibited H1N1 infection and had less toxicity. Se@OTV interfered with the H1N1 influenza virus to host cells through inhibiting the activity of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. The mechanism was that Se@OTV was able to prevent H1N1 from infecting MDCK cells and block chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, Se@OTV inhibited the generation of reactive oxygen species and activation of p53 phosphorylation and Akt. These results demonstrate that Se@OTV is a promising efficient antiviral pharmaceutical for H1N1.
