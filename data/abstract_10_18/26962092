The growing problem of antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), has reached a critical state. Tedizolid phosphate, dalbavancin, and oritavancin have recently been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) and represent the next generation of oxazolidinones and lipoglycopeptides. All three agents exhibit in vitro activity and clinical efficacy against MRSA. Tedizolid phosphate and oritavancin demonstrate in vitro activity against VRE. These new Gram-positive agents are reviewed here.
