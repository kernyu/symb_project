Nearly 15% to 25% of patients in general hospitals have a catheter at some time during their stay. Up to 97% of nosocomial urinary tract infections (UTIs) are related to catheter. The type of bacteremia is usually polymicrobial which makes the treatment more difficult. Previous studies showed an increase in mortality from bacteremia in these patients. The aim of the present study was to compare the prevalence of UTIs among patients with and without catheter, and to detect the type of bacteriuria and antibacterial resistance pattern. In this cross sectional study, samples were taken between Jan 2011 and July 2011. 678 hospitalized patients in different wards of Afzalipour hospital, Kerman- Iran, were enrolled in the study. E-test was applied to detect the pattern of resistance to gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxon and co-trimoxazole. Results showed positive culture samples in 86% of female patients. Escherichia coli, Candida and Staphylococcus aureus were detected in 72, 20 and 7 percent of the positive cultures, respectively. 52.3% of detected E.coli was sensitive to gentamicin , 62% to ceftriaxone, 71.4% to ciprofloxacin, and 91.9% were sensitive to nitrofurantoin. Therefore, the most sensitive antibiotics in UTIs were ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone. Unfortunately, the rate of antibacterial drug resistance was high in comparison with developed countries. Wise selection of antibiotics at hospitals and increasing the knowledge of patients to prevent self use of antibiotics can reduce antimicrobial resistance.
