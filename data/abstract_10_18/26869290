UNLABELLED: To assess the role of the serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK) kinase in multiple myeloma, we ectopically expressed wild type or a phosphomimetic version of SGK into multiple myeloma cell lines. These cells were specifically resistant to the ER stress inducers tunicamycin, thapsigargin, and bortezomib. In contrast, there was no alteration of sensitivity to dexamethasone, serum starvation, or mTORC inhibitors. Mining of genomic data from a public database indicated that low baseline SGK expression in multiple myeloma patients correlated with enhanced ability to undergo a complete response to subsequent bortezomib treatment and a longer time to progression and overall survival following treatment. SGK overexpressing multiple myeloma cells were also relatively resistant to bortezomib in a murine xenograft model. Parental/control multiple myeloma cells demonstrated a rapid upregulation of SGK expression and activity (phosphorylation of NDRG-1) during exposure to bortezomib and an SGK inhibitor significantly enhanced bortezomib-induced apoptosis in cell lines and primary multiple myeloma cells. In addition, a multiple myeloma cell line selected for bortezomib resistance demonstrated enhanced SGK expression and SGK activity. Mechanistically, SGK overexpression constrained an ER stress-induced JNK proapoptotic pathway and experiments with a SEK mutant supported the notion that SGK's protection against bortezomib was mediated via its phosphorylation of SEK (MAP2K4) which abated SEK/JNK signaling. These data support a role for SGK inhibitors in the clinical setting for myeloma patients receiving treatment with ER stress inducers like bortezomib. IMPLICATIONS: Enhanced SGK expression and activity in multiple myeloma cells contributes to resistance to ER stress, including bortezomib challenge.
