Fluconazole resistance is becoming an important clinical concern. We studied the in vitro effects of cinnamaldehyde against 18 fluconazole-resistant Candida isolates. MIC(90) of cinnamaldehyde against different Candida isolates ranged 100-500 mug/ml. Growth and sensitivity of the organisms were significantly affected by cinnamaldehyde at different concentrations. The rapid irreversible action of this compound on fungal cells suggested membrane-located targets for its action. Insight studies to mechanism suggested that cinnamaldehyde exerts its antifungal activity by targeting sterol biosynthesis and plasma membrane ATPase activity. Inhibition of H(+) (-)ATPase leads to intracellular acidification and cell death. Toxicity against H9c2 rat cardiac myoblasts was studied to exclude the possibility of further associated cytotoxicity. The observed selectively fungicidal characteristics against fluconazole-resistant Candida isolates signify a promising candidature of this essential oil as an antifungal agent in treatments for candidosis.
