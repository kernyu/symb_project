Streptococcus suis is an important pig pathogen with potential for human transmission. The serotype distributions and phenotypic characteristics vary over time and among regions; however, little is known about the characteristics of S. suis isolates in Korea. In this study, 240 S. suis isolates collected from pigs in Korea in 2009-2010 were serotyped by coagglutination tests, subsequently screened for three virulence-associated genes (mrp, epf and sly) and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. As for 80 isolates, the serotypes of which were relevant to human infections, clonal complexes (CCs) were further identified by PCR. Serotype 3 was the most prevalent (15.8%), followed by serotype 2 (15.0%), with geographical variation for each serotype. Overall, 55.4% of the isolates carried mrp, whereas only 3.8% carried epf. CC25 was the most prevalent (41.3%) and was related to serotypes 2 and 9. The isolates showed higher susceptibility to ampicillin (93.4%) and ceftiofur (90.8%) than to the other antimicrobial agents tested. The highest resistance rate was observed to tetracycline (98.0%), followed by erythromycin (88.8%). In addition, the resistance to certain antimicrobials was significantly associated, in part, with virulence-associated genes or serotypes. Therefore, continuous characterization of S. suis is essential for the benefit of veterinary and human medicine.
