Riboflavin analogs have a good potential to serve as basic structures for the development of novel anti-infectives. Riboflavin analogs have multiple cellular targets, since riboflavin (as a precursor to flavin cofactors) is active at more than one site in the cell. As a result, the frequency of developing resistance to antimicrobials based on riboflavin analogs is expected to be significantly lower. The only known natural riboflavin analog with antibiotic function is roseoflavin from the bacterium Streptomyces davawensis. This antibiotic negatively affects flavoenzymes and FMN riboswitches. Another roseoflavin producer, Streptomyces cinnabarinus, was recently identified. Possibly, flavin analogs with antibiotic activity are more widespread than anticipated. The same could be true for flavin analogs yet to be discovered, which could constitute tools for cellular chemistry, thus allowing a further extension of the catalytic spectrum of flavoenzymes.
