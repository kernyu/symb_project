In this work, we describe the activity of ACH-702 against clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and six different nontuberculous mycobacteria. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) of both susceptible and drug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains tested were 0.0625 and 0.125 microg/ml, respectively. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) values for Mycobacterium fortuitum isolates were 0.0625 microg/ml in both cases; Mycobacterium avium complex isolates showed MIC(50) and MIC(90) values of 0.25 and 4 microg/ml, respectively.
