Artemisinin (ART) and its derivatives form the mainstay of antimalarial therapy. Emergence of resistance to them poses a potential threat to future malaria control and elimination on a global level. It is important to know the mechanism of action of drug and development of drug resistance. We put forwards probable correlation between the mode of action of chloroquine (CQ) and ART. Modified trophozoite maturation inhibition assay, WHO Mark III assay and molecular marker study for CQ resistance at K76T codon in Plasmodium falciparum CQ-resistant transporter gene were carried out on cultured P. falciparum. On comparing trophozoite and schizont growth for both CQ-sensitive (MRC-2) and CQ-resistant (RKL-9) culture isolates, it was observed that the clearance of trophozoites and schizonts was similar with both drugs. The experiment supports that CQ interferes with heme detoxification pathway in food vacuoles of parasite, and this may be correlated as one of the plausible mechanisms of ART.
