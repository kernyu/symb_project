OBJECTIVES: To report reduction in transmission of multidrug resistant organisms from the neonatal intensive care unit after the implementation of simple risk-reduction strategies. METHODS: Using a pre-and-post design, the study was carried out from June 2010 to December 2011 at the neonatal intensive care unit of Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, which is 12-bed, level III facility. The intervention comprised hand washing certification for all staff, use of chlorhexidine instead of povodine iodine for skin preparation, use of non-sterile gloves for diaper change, implementation of barrier nursing for clinically-suspected and culture-proven infections, provision of separate intubation and central line trolley for each room and limiting the use of umbilical catheters to 7 days. Data is reported for 3-month pre-intervention period, one-month implementation phase, and for 3-month post-intervention phase. Data for 12 months post-implementation is reported to show sustainability. RESULTS: The average pre intervention rates of bloodstream infections due to extended spectrurm 3 lactamase, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas and methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus were 4.7, 3.3, 1.2 and zero respectively. The average number of admissions during the 3 phases was almost similar (49, 46 and 53 respectively). There was sustained reduction in rates for all organisms 12 months after the intervention period. CONCLUSION: Nosocomial transmission of multi drug resistant organisms within the neonatal intensive care unit can be effectively reduced by adopting simple strategies.
