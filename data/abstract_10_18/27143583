Eradication of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is critical in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. OBJECTIVES: To determine eradication success rate of newly acquired PA and to identify characteristics associated with eradication failure. METHODS: In an observational study, data from patients with newly acquired PA infection from 2007 to 2013 were collected. Clinical variables were compared in patients with and without successful eradication for >/=1year. RESULTS: Of 183 patients out of 740 (25%) from 7 CF Centers that had newly acquired PA, eradication succeeded in 72%. Patients with the highest risk of failure had multi-resistant PA, fewer sputum cultures taken, were older, and were diagnosed at a later age. The risk of eradication failure increased by 1.3% with each year of delayed CF diagnosis; successful eradication increased by 17% with each additional sputum culture taken. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed detection of PA infection leading to delayed treatment and growth of multi-resistant organisms is associated with eradication failure.
