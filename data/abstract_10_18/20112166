Azoles are important compounds for the treatment of fungal infections. This review focuses on three azoles: isavuconazole, ravuconazole and albaconazole (Stiefel). These drugs exhibit a broad spectrum of activity in vitro, including activity against several fungal isolates that are resistant to other azoles. However, poor or limited activity of these compounds has been demonstrated against species of Fusarium and Scedosporium, as well as against Zygomycetes. As isavuconazole and ravuconazole have been developed both as intravenous and oral formulations, these compounds are suitable candidates for the treatment of various invasive fungal diseases. Most clinical trials with albaconazole have targeted mucocutaneous fungal infections. Although all of these agents appear to be well tolerated, cross-resistance is a concern in the azole family of compounds.
