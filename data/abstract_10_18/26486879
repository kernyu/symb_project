To identify the mutations in multi- and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis isolates and to evaluate the use of molecular markers of resistance, we analyzed 257 multi- and extensively drug-resistant isolates and 64 pan-sensitive isolates from 23 provinces in China. Seven loci associated with drug resistance, including rpoB for rifampin (RIF), katG, inhA and oxyR-ahpC for isoniazid (INH), gyrA and gyrB for ofloxacin (OFX), and rrs for kanmycin (KAN), were examined by DNA sequencing. Compared with the phenotypic data, the sensitivity and specificity for DNA sequencing were 91.1% and 98.4% for RIF, 80.2% and 98.4% for INH, 72.2% and 98.3% for OFX and 40% and 98.2% for KAN, respectively. The most common mutations found in RIF, INH, OFX and KAN resistance were Ser531Leu (48.2%) in rpoB, Ser315Thr (49.8%) in katG, C(-15)T (10.5%) in inhA, Asp94Gly (20.3%), Asp94Ala (12.7%) and Ala90Val (21.5%) in gyrA, and A1401G (40%) in rrs. This molecular information will be helpful to establish new molecular biology-based methods for diagnosing multi- and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in China.
