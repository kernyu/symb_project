The H275Y oseltamivir resistance mutation confers high-level resistance to oseltamivir in isolates of human A(H1N1) influenza. We report the recovery and identification of an influenza B virus with the H273Y neuraminidase point mutation directly from a human patient. The H273Y influenza B isolate is resistant to oseltamivir and peramivir but sensitive to zanamivir.
