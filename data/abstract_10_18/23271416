This study was undertaken to determine the antimicrobial resistance patterns of Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica recovered from human, food, water, and animal samples collected in Khartoum State, Sudan. A total of 64 Salmonella isolates belonging to 28 different serovars were tested for their susceptibility to 13 antimicrobial agents. The majority of isolates (98.4 %) were resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent. Isolates were frequently resistant to ampicillin (90.6 %), cephalexin (50.0 %), nalidixic acid (25.0 %), streptomycin (21.9 %), kanamycin (18.8 %), gentamicin (17.2 %), and co-trimoxazole and trimethoprim (12.5 %). The most common pattern of multiple drug resistance included resistance to ampicillin and cephalexin. Most isolates were sensitive to chloramphenicol (98.4 %), ciprofloxacin (93.8 %), and norfloxacin (90.6 %). Two chicken- and the two human-origin S. Kentucky isolates were resistant to both ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin. All S. Kentucky isolates and the one S. Rissen isolate demonstrated multi-drug resistance. The results indicate the significance of multi-drug-resistant Salmonella serovars isolated from chickens and other animals and foods as sources for multi-drug-resistant Salmonella in humans in Sudan.
