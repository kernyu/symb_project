Bronchiectasis has become more rarely because of the development of antibiotic therapy and vaccination. At present the great majority of bronchiectasis is more likely caused by congenital disorders than by infective reasons. Therapeutic strategies based on the experiences from cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are not always conferrable to patients suffering from bronchiectasis. There are not enough controlled studies to give evidence-based recommendations in the treatment of bronchiectasis, which are not associated with cystic fibrosis. Goals in the treatment are improvement of the mucociliar clearance, the therapy of infections and treatment of inflammation. Currently several agents are under examination. To improve the prognosis and therapy options it would be reasonable to build up a national register for patients with bronchiectasis.
