Biofilm formation is a major problem in medical device-related infections leading to failure of implant-based therapies. Though various conventional approaches to counter biofilm formation like physical and/or mechanical removal, chemical removal, and the use of antimicrobials exist, they fail due to increased resistance of biofilms. This review discusses various nanomaterial-based approaches such as the use of metallic and metal oxide nanoparticles- and polymer-based nanocomposites, which are currently being developed for prevention and treatment of biofilms. Nanoparticles of transition metals and their oxides are toxic to microorganisms and exhibit their toxicity through the generation of reactive oxygen species at concentrations that are non-toxic to eukaryotic cells. Other approaches include the entrapment of bioactive agents in polymer/ceramic nanoparticles, for enhanced anti-biofilm activity due to the synergistic effect between them. These nanomaterial-based approaches could play an important role in control and eradication of biofilm related infections and complications associated with medical devices and implants.
