We describe a novel HRM-PCR (high-resolution melting) assay capable of the accurate identification of the G2576T point mutation in domain V of the 23S rRNA genes attributed to linezolid resistance in Staphylococcus epidermidis. This rapid method demonstrated 100% correlation with the previously established NheI restriction digest assay.
