The bacterial community shift on a lab scale Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) fed with synthetic wastewater and exposed to 50mugL(-1) of sulfamethoxazole (SFX) for 2months was investigated in this study. The impact on biological nutrient removal performance and SFX removal efficiencies were also studied. Satisfactory biological nutrient removal was observed as regards to COD and Nitrogen. SFX removal efficiencies ranged between 20% and 50% throughout the experimental period, enhanced within the aerobic phases of the SBR cycle, with no evident signs of biomass acclimation. Nevertheless, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis showed significant variance leading to not only the fading, but also the emergence of new species in the bioreactor bacterial community after SFX dosage. According to the phylogenetic analysis, bacteria belonging to Betaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria classes were the dominant species, among them, the Thiotrix spp. (Gammaproteobacteria) cell number increased due to its tolerance to the antibiotic. On the other hand, the classes Sphingobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi and Chlorobi were found to be more vulnerable to the antibiotic load and disappeared. The sulphonamide resistance gene sulI was also quantified and discussed, as there are very few studies on bacterial resistance in lab-scale treatment reactors.
