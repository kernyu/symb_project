BACKGROUND & AIMS: BI201335 is a highly specific and potent HCV protease inhibitor. This multiple rising dose trial evaluated antiviral activity and safety in chronic HCV genotype-1 patients. METHODS: Thirty-four treatment-naive patients were randomized to monotherapy with placebo or BI201335 at 20-240 mg once-daily for 14 days, followed by combination with pegylated interferon alfa/ribavirin (PegIFN/RBV) through Day 28. Nineteen treatment-experienced patients received 48-240 mg BI201335 once-daily with PegIFN/RBV for 28 days. HCV-RNA was measured with Roche COBAS TaqMan. RESULTS: In treatment-naive patients, median maximal viral load (VL) reductions during 14-day monotherapy were -3.0, -3.6, -3.7, and -4.2 log(10) for the 20, 48, 120, and 240 mg groups. VL breakthroughs (>/=1 log(10) from nadir) were seen in most patients on monotherapy and were caused by NS3/4A variants (R155K, D168V) conferring in vitro resistance to BI201335. Adding PegIFN/RBV at Days 15-28 led to continuous viral load reductions in most patients. In treatment-experienced patients, treatment with BI201335 and PegIFN/RBV achieved VL<25 IU/ml at Day 28 in 3/6, 4/7, and 5/6 patients in the 48, 120, and 240 mg dose groups. VL breakthroughs were observed during triple combination in only 3/19 patients. BI201335 was generally well tolerated. Mild rash or photosensitivity was detected in four patients. Mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia was the only dose-dependent laboratory abnormality of BI201335. BI201335 elimination half-life supports once-daily dosing. CONCLUSIONS: BI201335 combined with PegIFN/RBV was well tolerated and induced strong antiviral responses. These results support further development of BI201335 in HCV genotype-1 patients.
