BACKGROUND: The need for new effective Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy has focused efforts on the development and optimization of regimens with excellent eradication rates such as 14-day hybrid therapy. This study evaluated whether the duration of hybrid therapy could be reduced while maintaining a high eradication rate and to examine the effect of antibiotic resistance on outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three separate multicenter pilot studies were carried out concurrently. To reduce selection bias, eligible subjects were randomized to 10-day, 12-day, or 14-day hybrid therapy consisting of esomeprazole 40 mg and amoxicillin 1 gm twice daily for 10, 12, or 14 days plus clarithromycin 500 mg, and metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for the final 7 days. The primary outcome was H. pylori eradication per-protocol assessed at least 8 weeks after therapy. RESULTS: A total of 220 subjects were entered. The per-protocol analyses contained 60, 61, 61 subjects in the 10-, 12- and 14-day therapy studies, respectively. The eradication rates, per-protocol, were similar: 95% (95% confidence interval (CI); 89.5-100%) for 10-day, 95.1% (95% CI; 89.7-100%) for 12-day, and 93.4% (95% CI; 87.2-99.7%) for 14-day hybrid therapies. Antibiotic resistance was infrequent; however, all metronidazole or clarithromycin resistances were cured with 12- and 14-day therapies. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that in regions of moderate to low clarithromycin and/or metronidazole resistance it may be feasible to shorten hybrid therapy to 10 or 12 days. Further study is needed to compare hybrid and concomitant therapy in regions with moderate-to-high clarithromycin and/or metronidazole resistance.
