Small-colony variants (SCVs) were obtained from an Enterobacter cloacae clinical isolate in Okinawa, Japan. One variant showed auxotrophy for hemin with a deletion of 20 365 nucleotides, dosC-ydiK-mmuP-mmuM-tauA-tauB-tauC-tauD-hemB-yaiT-yaiV-ampH-yddQ-sbmA-yaiW-yaiY-y aiZ, including hemB, and was more resistant to aminoglycosides and carbapenems, but more susceptible to aztreonam, than the parent strain.
