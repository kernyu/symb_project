The development of Lactobacillus plantarum to be used in starter cultures in the food industry has been limited because of the lack of a food-grade cloning vector for the bacterium. In this study, the plasmid pFLP1 was constructed by joining 2 DNA fragments derived from food-approved organisms. The 5.2-kb BamHI/KpnI DNA fragment of pRV566 containing the theta-type replicon of Lactobacillus sakei was ligated to the BamHI/KpnI DNA fragment of a 2.9-kb lactococcal cadmium resistance determinant amplified from pND918. The 8.1-kb newly constructed plasmid could transform L. plantarum N014, a bacteriocin-producing bacteria originally isolated from nham, a traditional Thai fermented sausage. The resulting transformant, L. plantarum N014-FLP, and its parent strain were shown to be very similar in growth rate and bacteriocin activity. In addition, the plasmid was very stable in its host bacteria under nonselective pressure for 100 generations in MRS medium and for 5 days in a nham model. These results suggest that pFLP1 is a potential food-grade cloning vector for L. plantarum.
