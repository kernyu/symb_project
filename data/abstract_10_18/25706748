In order to understand the mechanism governing radiation resistance in Deinococcus radiodurans, current efforts are aimed at identifying potential candidates from a large repertoire of unique Deinococcal genes and protein families. DR0053 belongs to the DinB/YfiT protein family, which is an over-represented protein family in D. radiodurans. We observed that dr0053 transcript levels were highly induced in response to gamma radiation (gamma-radiation) and mitomycin C (MMC) exposure depending on PprI, RecA and the DrtR/S two-component signal transduction system. Protein profiles demonstrated that DR0053 is a highly induced protein in cultures exposed to 10 kGy gamma-radiation. We were able to determine the transcriptional start site of dr0053, which was induced upon irradiation, and to assign the 133-bp promoter region of dr0053 as essential for radiation responsiveness through primer extension and promoter deletion analyses. A dr0053 mutant strain displayed sensitivity to gamma-radiation and MMC exposure, but not hydrogen peroxide, suggesting that DR0053 helps cells recover from DNA damage. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that DR0053 is similar to the Bacillus subtilis protein YjoA, which is a substrate of bacterial protein-tyrosine kinases. Taken together, the DNA damage-inducible (din) gene dr0053 may be regulated at the transcriptional and post-translational levels.
