The number of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in community-acquired urinary tract infections worldwide is probably underestimated because of the technical difficulties encountered with their detection. In this study, out of 5,672 urine samples analyzed, 916 were positive for uropathogens, 472 of them being enterobacteria of which 7.6% produced beta-lactamases. Analysis of the isolated from 36 patients showed a high level of antibiotic resistance, with 52.7% and 80.5% of isolates expressing bla TEM and bla CTX-M, respectively.
