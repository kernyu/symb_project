Because of microbial resistance to conventional antibiotics, there is increasing interest in silver, including silver nanoparticles (nano-Ag), in antimicrobial applications. However, questions remain regarding the relative roles of nano-Ag particles, versus Ag(+) ions released from nano-Ag dissolution, in imparting bacterial toxicity. Here, we developed a novel nano-Ag that, based on its cysteine cap, was expected to dissolve slowly and thus potentially allow for differentiating nanoparticle, versus ionic, effects of Ag. The nano-Ag was systematically tested for its differential toxicity to Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Bacterial growth, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, particle dissolution, cellular electron transfer activity, and cell membrane damage and potential were evaluated. In minimal growth medium, E. coli and P. aeruginosa growth were slowed at 100 mg L(-1) (0.93 mM) and 5 mg L(-1) (0.046 mM), respectively; P. aeruginosa was completely inhibited at and above 10 mg L(-1) (0.093 mM). For both strains, toxicity was associated with ROS and cell membrane damage. Based on comparisons to AgNO3 exposures, toxicity from nano-Ag was due to Ag(+) ions and not intact nano-Ag, even though nanoparticle dissolution was less than 2% in minimal growth medium. Because of their stability and slow Ag(+) ion release, the cysteine-capped nano-Ag particles here are useful to antimicrobial applications. Additionally, our systematic approach to evaluating toxicity, membrane damage, and ROS generation can be applied with other nanomaterials and bacteria.
