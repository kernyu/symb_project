INTRODUCTION: Candidiasis is one of the most common fungal infections among patients infected by human immunodeficiency virus. The present study aimed to characterize yeasts of the genus Candida from distinct clinical samples from HIV-positive patients and determine the in vitro susceptibility profile to five antifungal drugs. METHODS: Characterization of Candida sp was achieved using the classic methodology: biochemical (zymogram and auxanogram) and micromorphology (germinative tube growth test and slide microculture) tests. Genotypic technique (PCR) and identification by the commercial method API 20C AUX (Biomerieux) were also performed. To determine the in vitro susceptibility profile, five antifungal drugs were used (ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole and amphotericin-B) following a commercially available method, the Etest. RESULTS: The procedure isolated 105 yeasts of the genus Candida from 102 HIV-infected patients. Of these, 82 (78.1%) were characterized as Candida albicans, 8 (7.6%) as C. parapsilosi s, 8 (7.6%) C. tropicalis, 4 (3.8%) C. krusei, 2 (1.9%) C. glabrata, and 1 (1%) as C. guiilliermondii. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the general profile of sensitivity, 60% of isolates were susceptible to all the antifungal drugs tested; however, the species C. tropicalis and C. krusei showed a tendency toward higher MICs to azoles than those obtained for C. albicans, suggesting resistance.
