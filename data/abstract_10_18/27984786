Alternative solutions need to be developed to overcome the growing problem of multi-drug resistant bacteria. This study explored the possibility of creating complexes of antibiotics with metal ions, thereby increasing their activity. Analytical techniques such as isothermal titration calorimetry and nuclear magnetic resonance were used to examine the structure and interactions between Cu(II), Ag(I) or Zn(II) and beta-lactam antibiotics. The metal-beta-lactam complexes were also tested for antimicrobial activity, by micro-broth dilution and disk diffusion methods, showing a synergistic increase in the activity of the drugs, and enzymatic inhibition assays confirming inhibition of beta-lactamases responsible for resistance. The metal-antibiotic complex concept was proven to be successful with the activity of the drugs enhanced against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. The highest synergistic effects were observed for complexes formed with Ag(I).
