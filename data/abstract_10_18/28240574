Clofazimine (CFZ), a riminophenazine and a key component of the treatment regimen for lepromatous leprosy, has been rehabilitated clinically for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Observational studies and a randomized control trial suggest efficacy in the treatment of MDR-TB and the potential for treatment shortening. Animal and translational research have shown mixed results. In this article, we review key clinical, animal, and translational data to better understand the potential role of CFZ in the treatment of MDR-TB and in shortening anti-tuberculosis treatment.
