PURPOSE: Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) mediated resistance is more prevalent worldwide, especially among Gram-negative bacterial isolates, conferring resistance to the expanded spectrum cephalosporins. As limited data were available on the prevalence of ESBLs in this area, the current study was undertaken to determine the prevalence, antibacterial resistance patterns, and molecular detection and characterization of ESBL encoding resistance genes among ocular Gram-negative bacterial isolates from ocular infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study was done on 252 ocular Gram-negative bacterial isolates recovered from ocular infections during a study period from February 2011 to January 2014. All isolates were subjected to detection of ESBLs by cephalosporin/clavulanate combination disc test and their antibacterial resistance pattern was studied. Molecular detection and characterization of ESBL encoding blaTEM -, blaSHV , blaOXA -, and blaCTX-M (phylogenetic groups 1, 2, 9, and 8/25) resistance genes by multiplex polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequence analysis. RESULTS: Of all Gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (44%) was the most common strain, followed by Enterobacter agglomerans and Klebsiella pneumoniae each (10%). Among the 252, 42 (17%) were ESBL producers. The major source of ESBL producers were corneal scraping specimens, highest ESBL production was observed in P. aeruginosa 16 (38%) and Escherichia coli 7 (16.6%). Among ESBL-producing genes, the prevalence of blaTEM -gene was the highest (83%) followed by blaOXA -gene (35%), blaSHV -gene (18.5%), and blaCTX-M-1 -gene (18.5%) alone or together. CONCLUSION: The higher rate of prevalence of ESBLs-encoding genes among ocular Gram-negative bacteria is of great concern, as it causes limitation to therapeutic options. This regional knowledge will help in guiding appropriate antibiotic use which is highly warranted.
