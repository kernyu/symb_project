The antibiotic resistance patterns of aetiological agents responsible for vibriosis and pasteurellosis were studied to contribute to control the spread of these two bacterial diseases in Mediterranean fish farming. Strains of Photobacterium damsela ssp. piscicida, Vibrio fluvialis, Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio metschnikovii, isolated from Italian aquaculture (fish, shellfish and crustaceans) sites, were assayed for their susceptibility to some antibacterial agents currently used in farming practices. Kirby Bauer and Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (M.I.C.) tests were performed. The bacterial strains showed resistance to ampicillin, carbenicillin, kanamycin, cefalothin, while they were sensitive to chloramphenicol, nitrofurantoin and tobramycin; the sulfadiazine-trimethoprim association was completely ineffective. Conversely, flumequine showed the lowest M.I.C. value (0.97 g mL-1), suggesting its marked antibiotic effect. Considering that quinolone resistance can be transmitted only by selection of mutations and not by other genetic mechanisms, this study stresses the importance of a more responsible use of this antibacterial drug in aquaculture.
