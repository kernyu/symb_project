In this research, the creation of optimum conditions for the formation of sodium hyaluronate-TiO2 bionanocomposite and its antibacterial effect on gram positive and gram negative bacteria was evaluated. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectra, scanning electron microscopy images and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy pattern confirmed the formation of the bionanocomposite. Thermogravimetric analysis and differential thermal analysis indicated that the thermal stability rate had significantly improved with formation of the bionanocomposite. Nine experiments were designed based on the Taguchi method by applying different proportions of sodium hyaluronate biopolymer and TiO2 nanoparticles at different stirring times. Bionanocomposite produced under conditions of experiment 5 (TiO2 4mg/ml, sodium hyaluronate 1mg/ml and stirring time of 90min) and experiment 9 (TiO2 8mg/ml, sodium hyaluronate 2mg/ml and stirring time of 60min) completely prevented the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. It can be concluded that sodium hyaluronate-TiO2 bionanocomposite can be used as an effective antimicrobial compound in food, pharmaceutical, medical and environmental sectors.
