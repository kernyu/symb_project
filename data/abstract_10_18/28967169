AIM: To describe the epidemiology of non-typhoid Salmonella (NTS) infection in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), including factors associated with hospitalisation. METHODS: This was a retrospective descriptive and observational study of culture-confirmed NTS infections using data collected from ACT public health, public pathology and hospital services in the period 2003-2012. Outcome measures include incidence and NTS serotype for total reported and hospitalised cases and focus of infection, complications and antibiotic susceptibility for hospitalised cases. RESULTS: In total, 1469 cases of NTS infection were reported, with the crude annual incidence increasing from 24.4 to 61.3 cases per 100 000 population; 14% were hospitalised, representing an incidence of 5.9 hospitalisations per 100 000 population, without significant change over time. Hospitalisation incidence peaked at the extremes of age. Comorbid disease and age >/= 80 years were associated with complications during hospitalisation. Salmonella serotype Typhimurium was the most common serotype, accounting for 64% of NTS. Independent risk factors for invasive disease included non-S. Typhimurium serotype (aRR 5.46, 95%CI 1.69-17.65 P = 0.005), ischaemic heart disease (aRR 4.18, 95%CI 1.20-14.60 P = 0.025) and haematological malignancy (aRR 6.93, 95%CI 2.54-18.94 P < 0.001). Among hospitalised patients, resistance to ampicillin, ceftriaxone, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and quinolones was 9.9%, 0%, 4.4% and 2.5% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: NTS notifications in the ACT have increased over time, with outbreaks of food-borne disease contributing to this increase. Crude age-specific incidence is highest in the very young, while rates of hospitalisation are highest in the elderly. Comorbid disease and infection with a non-S. Typhimurium serotype were associated with complicated NTS disease course. Antimicrobial resistance in NTS is low and has not increased over time.
