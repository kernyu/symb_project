Helicobacter pylori is the most widespread infection all over the Word. The rate of this infection varies, depending on age, geographic region, socioeconomic and hygienic conditions. Most infected children live in the poor, developing countries without adequate living and hygienic conditions. Prevalence of H. pylori infections in children in Poland was 32.01%. The course of infection in children depends on individual predisposition, environmental factors and virulence of H. pylori. In children in Poland infection with cagA+s1m1 genotype occurs most frequently. In children, a connection of H. pylori infection to ulcer disease of the duodenum was demonstrated. Additionally, the diagnostic tests of infection and diagnostic assessing eradication were discussed in the work. Recommendations on the treatment of H. pylori taking into account the necessity of the assessment of bacteria sensitivity to antibiotics were outlined. It is particularly important in the regions with high resistance of H. pylori to clarythromycin, which in children can exceed 20%.
