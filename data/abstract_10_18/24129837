Investigation of a serious pig disease with high mortality and typical lung lesions yielded a bacterial isolate identified as Providencia alcalifaciens based on the 16S ribosomal DNA sequence analysis. The pathogenicity of this bacterial isolate was confirmed in piglets and mice. The bacterial strain caused the typical illness in piglets, which suffered serious dyspnea and hemorrhagic pneumonia. The drug resistance spectrum of the bacterium was also determined. The results indicated that the isolate is resistant to 12 antibiotics and intermediately resistant to 10 antibiotics out of the 34 antibiotics tested. The current study is the first to report a serious lung disease in piglets caused by a multidrug resistant P. alcalifaciens isolate, which should be given more attention during surveillance and diagnostics.
