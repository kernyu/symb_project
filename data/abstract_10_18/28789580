BACKGROUND: Management practices of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) were compared between two areas with similar healthcare structure and low prevalence of antimicrobial resistance. METHODS: The high affinity to public health-care in the Nordic countries enabled population-based approach used in this retrospective study. The study population (n = 460) consisted of all adult residents from Helsinki (Finland) and Gothenburg (Sweden) treated in hospital due to cSSSI during 2008-2011. RESULTS: The majority of patients in Helsinki (57%) visited more than one ward during their hospital stay while in Gothenburg the majority of patients (85%) were treated in one ward only. Background and disease characteristics were largely similar in both cities but patients in Helsinki were younger [mean(SD) 59(18) versus 63(19) years, p = .0117], and greater proportions had diabetes (50% versus 32%, p < .0001) and polymicrobial infections (34% versus 13%, p < .0001). Patients in Helsinki received antimicrobials with Gram-negative coverage (in initial therapy 96%) more frequently than in Gothenburg (47%, p < .0001), had more treatment modifications (mean 4.3 versus 2.7 antibiotic agents used per patient, p < .0001), and longer median duration of antimicrobial therapy (29 versus 12 days, p < .0001) and median length of hospital stay (17 versus 11 days, p < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: This real-life study revealed remarkable differences in the management of cSSSI between the two Nordic cities. Compared to mainly Infectious Disease Specialist guided treatment in Gothenburg, the more frequent transfer from one ward to another in Helsinki was linked to longer antimicrobial therapy and hospital stay and to more frequent changes in antimicrobial treatment.
