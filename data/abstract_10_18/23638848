The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and molecular typing of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in food-producing animals and retail meat in Fargo, North Dakota. A two-step enrichment followed by culture methods were used to isolate S. aureus from 167 nasal swabs from animals, 145 samples of retail raw meat, and 46 samples of deli meat. Positive isolates were subjected to multiplex polymerase chain reaction in order to identify the genes 16S rRNA, mecA, and Panton-Valentine Leukocidin. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing were used for molecular typing of S. aureus strains. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out using the broth microdilution method. The overall prevalence of S. aureus was 37.2% (n=133), with 34.7% (n=58) of the animals positive for the organism, and the highest prevalence observed in pigs (50.0%) and sheep (40.6%) (p<0.05); 47.6% (n=69) of raw meat samples were positive, with the highest prevalence in chicken (67.6%) and pork (49.3%) (p<0.05); and 13.0% (n=6) of deli meat was positive. Five pork samples (7.0%) were positive for MRSA, of which three were ST398 and two were ST5. All exhibited penicillin resistance and four were multidrug resistant (MDR). The Panton-Valentine Leukocidin gene was not detected in any sample by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. The most common clones in sheep were ST398 and ST133, in pigs and pork both ST398 and ST9, and in chicken ST5. Most susceptible S. aureus strains were ST5 isolated from chicken. The MDR isolates were found in pigs, pork, and sheep. The presence of MRSA, MDR, and the subtype ST398 in the meat production chain and the genetic similarity between strains of porcine origin (meat and animals) suggest the possible contamination of meat during slaughtering and its potential transmission to humans.
