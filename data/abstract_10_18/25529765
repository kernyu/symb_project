INTRODUCTION: Decisions regarding empirical antimicrobial therapy for complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs) are increasingly difficult because of the threat of antimicrobial resistance. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae are a particular challenge, as is multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, both of which are encountered in cIAI. Ceftolozane/tazobactam is a new antimicrobial that provides an effective solution for treating cIAI. AREAS COVERED: Evidence concerning the mechanism of action of ceftolozane/tazobactam, its in vitro activity against common cIAI pathogens, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties are reviewed. The clinical efficacy and safety of ceftolozane/tazobactam plus metronidazole, as determined by the Phase II and III clinical trials in hospitalized adults with cIAI, are discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Ceftolozane/tazobactam has demonstrated efficacy and safety in patients with cIAI, including those who are infected with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. High rates of clinical cure by ceftolozane/tazobactam in Phase II and III trials suggest that this antimicrobial will be valuable for treating infections caused by MDR Gram-negative bacteria. In recent years, clinicians have become dependent on carbapenems for treating MDR infections. There is concern that this could lead to emergence of carbapenem-resistant strains, emphasizing the importance of antimicrobial stewardship. Ceftolozane/tazobactam appears to be an effective carbapenem-sparing alternative for treating cIAI.
