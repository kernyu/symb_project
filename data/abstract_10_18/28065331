BACKGROUND: The availability of effective antibiotics is considered one of the most important developments in medicine. However, many organisms that were once susceptible to common antibiotics are becoming resistant. Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) are considered to be vital for combating the emergence of resistance. To understand current antimicrobial stewardship practices in Kansas, the authors designed a 36-question survey. Results of this survey will be used to develop a coordinated, public health strategy for improving current practices. METHODS: To assess the number of ASPs and general antimicrobial stewardship practices in Kansas, a 36-question survey was developed and sent out to infection preventionists at all 154 acute care facilities in Kansas via e-mail. RESULTS: Of the 154 eligible facilities, 129 (83.7%) responded to this survey, and 61 of 127 (48%) had a formal committee devoted to antimicrobial stewardship. Acute care facilities were more likely than critical access facilities to have formal committees and were also more likely to engage in core stewardship strategies. CONCLUSIONS: In a world with increasing microbial resistance, the role of public health in antimicrobial stewardship is becoming more important. After surveying all hospitals in Kansas about antimicrobial stewardship practices, we realize that critical access hospitals have the greatest need for support and may see the greatest opportunities for development and improvements.
