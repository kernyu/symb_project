Little is known about the extent and predictors of polymorphisms potentially influencing susceptibility to HIV integrase inhibitors. HIV-1 genetic diversity and drug resistance are major challenges in patient management globally. To evaluate HIV genetic diversity and drug resistance-associated mutations within a Nairobi cohort, genetic analysis of the HIV-1 pol-integrase gene regions was performed on samples collected from 42 subjects and 113 Kenyan intergrase sequences deposited in the Los Alamos HIV database. From the partial pol-integrase sequences analyzed phylogenetically, it was shown that 26 (61.9%) were subtype A1, 9 (21.4%) were subtype D, 5 (11.9%) were subtype C, 1 (2.4%) was subtype A2 and 1 (2.4%) was subtype CRF. Integrase-associated mutations were found in 12 patients, and in all 113 sequences already deposited in GenBank. One sample from this study and five from previous Kenyan integrase sequences had mutations at T97A, which is associated with reduced susceptibility to raltegravir.
