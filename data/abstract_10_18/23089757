Achromobacter xylosoxidans is an innately multidrug-resistant pathogen which is emerging in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. We characterized a new resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND)-type multidrug efflux pump, AxyXY-OprZ. This system is responsible for the intrinsic high-level resistance of A. xylosoxidans to aminoglycosides (tobramycin, amikacin, and gentamicin). Furthermore, it can extrude cefepime, carbapenems, some fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, and erythromycin. Some of the AxyXY-OprZ substrates are major components widely used to treat pulmonary infections in CF patients.
