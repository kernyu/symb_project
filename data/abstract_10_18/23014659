Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is a treatment option for patients with poor-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Sequential use of chemotherapy and reduced-intensity conditioning has been proposed to improve the treatment outcomes. Fludarabine (30 mg/m(2)/day) and cytarabine (2 g/m(2)/day) for 4 days (combination of fludarabine with cytarabine; FAraC) were used for cytoreduction. After 3 days of rest, reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) was carried out consisting of 4 Gy total body irradiation, 10-20 mg/kg/day antithymocyte globulin for 3 days, and 40-60 mg/kg/day cyclophosphamide for 2 days. The median time of neutrophil engraftment was 16 days. The most frequent toxicities were grades III/IV infections in 12 of 15 cases and gastrointestinal toxicities in 8 of 15 cases. Remission (complete remission + partial remission) was achieved in 14 of 15 patients (93 %), minimal residual disease negativity according to flowcytometric analysis was observed in 10 patients. Nonrelapse mortality after 1 and 2 years was 7 and 13 %, respectively. After the median follow-up from SCT of 30 months, 80 % of patients were alive (12/15), three patients have died, and three relapses occurred. The FAraC-RIC protocol seems to be a promising approach to the treatment of poor-risk CLL with a high response rate of 93 % and favorable progression-free survival and overall survival of 70 and 85 % at 2 years after SCT, respectively. Other prospective clinical trials are needed to confirm the results of this novel therapeutic strategy.
