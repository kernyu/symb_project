A total of 41 Salmonella Enteritidis strains, including phago-types (PTs) PT4 and PT9, were characterized by antimicrobial resistance profiles and PFGE. Of these strains, 34 were isolated from patients and foods, and 7 were of poultry origin. All strains were susceptible to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and 41.5 % (n = 17) were resistant to nalidixic acid. PFGE analysis using XbaI and SpeI restriction enzymes resulted in X1S1 as the prevalent pattern, which was present in 48.8 % (n = 20) of epidemic strains and in one strain isolated from discarded hatching eggs. Distinct patterns were found for the other strains isolated from poultry (X3S1, X8S8, X11S12, X11S13, X16S1 and X13S15). The S. Enteritidis PT9 strains associated with outbreaks of salmonellosis were highly similar (>/=0.90), suggesting clonality. The PFGE genotypes were related to the PTs, and it was possible to differentiate strains isolated from patients with salmonellosis from other strains of non-epidemic origin. The PFGE results suggested that the S. Enteritidis strains of poultry origin were a possible source of human salmonellosis during the study period.
