The emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram negative bacteria presents a serious threat for public health. Novel antimicrobials that could overcome the resistance problems are urgently needed. UDP-3-O-(R-3-hydroxymyristol)-N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase (LpxC) is a cytosolic zinc-based deacetylase that catalyzes the first committed step in the biosynthesis of lipid A, which is essential for the survival of Gram-negative bacteria. Our efforts toward the discovery of novel LpxC inhibitors are presented herein.
