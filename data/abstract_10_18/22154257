Gastrointestinal helminth parasites impact on livestock production systems throughout the world, and the use of anthelmintics to control this problem has lead to the inevitable development of populations of helminths resistant to these treatments. This, coupled with consumer desires for minimal chemical inputs into food and fibre production, has prompted research into non-chemical approaches to helminth control. Scientists of the "Novel Approaches to the Control of Helminth Parasites of Livestock" group met for the 6th time in August 2010 and this paper summarises that meeting. Six scientific sessions addressed current approaches and topics of interest through formal presentations and discussion of issues raised by the contributing authors. Close interaction between researchers and extension specialists during the meeting has contributed to enhanced prospects for field application of research outcomes in the future.
