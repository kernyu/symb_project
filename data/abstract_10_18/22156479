BACKGROUND/AIMS: Insulin resistance (IR) has been reported to be an independent predictor of treatment outcome in chronic hepatitis C patients. METHODS: We analyzed the relationship between IR and the outcome of pegylated interferon and ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV) therapy, taking into account host factors of body mass index and histological index, such as rate of fatty change and fibrosis. Japanese patients (n = 30; 19 men and 11 women; median age 60.0 +/- 8.7 years) with chronic hepatitis C-1b with a high viral load were treated with PEG-IFN-alpha2b/RBV for 48 weeks. RESULTS: Sustained virological response (SVR) was seen in 60% (18/30) and non-SVR in 40% (12/30). HOMA-IR (homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance index) at the start and at 24 weeks of treatment showed no statistical difference between SVR and non-SVR. Correlation was observed between HOMA-IR and body mass index (r = 0.45, p = 0.013). Among 20 patients, steatosis and fibrosis were assessed by biopsy. Correlation was observed between HOMA-IR and steatosis (r = 0.57, p = 0.0093), whereas no correlation was observed between HOMA-IR and fibrosis. CONCLUSION: A larger prospective study is needed to clarify the role of IR in the outcome of PEG-IFN/RBV combination therapy and hepatic fibrosis in Japanese patients.
