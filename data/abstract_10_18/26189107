In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), refractory disease is a major challenge and the leukemia microenvironment may harbor refractory disease. Human AML cell lines KG-1 and HL-60 expressed receptors also found on endothelial cells (ECs) such as VEGFRs, PDGFRs, and cKit. When human AML cells were co-cultured with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and primary bone marrow endothelial cell (BMECs), the AML cells were more resistant to cytarabine chemotherapy, even in transwell co-culture suggesting angiocrine regulation. Primary BMECs secreted significantly increased levels of VEGF-A and PDGF-AB after exposure to cytarabine. Pazopanib, a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RTKI) of VEGFRs, PDGFRs, and cKit, removed EC protection of AML cells and enhanced AML cell sensitivity to cytarabine. Xenograft modeling showed significant regression of AML cells and abrogation of BM hypervascularity in RTKI treated cohorts. Together, these results show direct cytotoxicity of RTKIs on AML cells and reversal of EC protection. Combining RTKIs with chemotherapy may serve as promising therapeutic strategy for patients with AML.
