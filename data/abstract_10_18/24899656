A Gram-stain-negative, facultatively anaerobic, non-motile and coccoid- to short-rod-shaped bacterium, designated strain Dys-CH1(T), was isolated from the hindgut of a fungus-growing termite Macrotermes barneyi. The optimal pH and cultivation temperature of strain Dys-CH1(T) were pH 7.2-7.6 and 35-37 degrees C, respectively. Sequence analysis of 16S rRNA gene showed that Dys-CH1(T) shared 94.6 % and 90.9 % similarity with Dysgonomonas capnocytophagoides JCM 16697(T) and Dysgonomonas gadei CCUG 42882(T), respectively. Strain Dys-CH1(T) was found to be different from other species of the genus Dysgonomonas with validly published names with respect to taxonomically important traits, including habitat, biochemical tests, DNA G+C content, bile resistance, fatty-acid composition and susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. On the basis of these characteristics, strain Dys-CH1(T) represents a novel species of the genus Dysgonomonas for which the name Dysgonomonas macrotermitis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is Dys-CH1(T) ( = JCM 19375(T) = DSM 27370(T)).
