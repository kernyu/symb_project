Synthesis of a library of novel trans 6-methoxy-1,1-dimethyl-2-phenyl-3-aryl-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-4-yloxy alkyl amines and their antimycobacterial activity against drug sensitive and multidrug resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis have been reported. All the new compounds in the series exhibited MIC between 1.56 and 6.25 mug/ml. Two compounds 1i and 1j with low MIC and low cytotoxicity showed significant reduction in CFU in infected mouse macrophages at 1x MIC concentration. The compound 1i inhibited the growth of M. tuberculosis in mice at 100mg/kg dose with 1.35 log10 reduction of CFU in lungs tissue and was active against non-replicating Mycobacterium tuberculosis under anaerobic condition.
