Pneumonia is one of the leading causes of death in the elderly. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading etiological agent, but the identification of a pathogen remains infrequent despite advances in microbiological methods. Antibiotic resistant organisms should be considered as potential causal agents in recently hospitalized patients and patients with recent antibiotic exposure and influenza during the flu season. The clinical diagnosis is difficult due to frequent atypical presentation. Prognostic scores are not always appropriate to predict the need for hospitalization in very old patients. Studies on the role of low-dose chest CT for the diagnosis, management and prevention should help improve the management of this disease in the future.
