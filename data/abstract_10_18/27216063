We report the complete nucleotide sequence of a plasmid, pA31-12, carrying blaCTX-M-55 and mcr-1 from a chicken Escherichia coli isolate. pA31-12 has an IncI2 replicon that displays extensive sequence similarity with pHN1122-1-borne blaCTX-M-55 and pHNSHP45-borne mcr-1 Insertion sequences ISEcp1 and ISApl1 are responsible for the mobilization of blaCTX-M-55 and mcr-1, respectively. The colocalization of mcr-1 with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene on a conjugative plasmid may accelerate the dissemination of both genes by coselection.
