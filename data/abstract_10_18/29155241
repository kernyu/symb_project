This work revealed the drug resistance and population structure of Moraxella catarrhalis strains isolated from children less than three years old with pneumonia. Forty-four independent M. catarrhalis strains were analyzed using broth dilution antimicrobial susceptibility testing and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The highest non-susceptibility rate was observed for amoxicillin (AMX), which reached 95.5%, followed by clindamycin (CLI) (n=33; 75.0%), azithromycin (AZM) (61.4%), cefaclor (CEC) (25.0%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT) (15.9%), cefuroxime (CXM) (4.5%), tetracycline (TE) (2.3%), and doxycycline (DOX) (2.3%). There was no strain showing non-susceptibility to other six antimicrobials. Using MLST, the 44 M. catarrhalis strains were divided into 33 sequence types (STs). Based on their allelic profiles, the 33 STs were divided into one CC (CC363) and 28 singletons. CC363 contained five STs and ST363 was the founder ST. CC363 contained 63.6%, 33.3%, and 40.7% of CEC non-susceptible, CLI non-susceptible and AZM non-susceptible strains, respectively. The proportions of CEC non-susceptible, CLI non-susceptible and AZM non-susceptible strains in CC363 were higher than that of singletons; these differences were significant for CEC (p=0.002) and AZM (p=0.011). Furthermore, CC363 contained more AMX-CLI-AZM co-non-susceptible and AMX-CEC-CLI-AZM co-non-susceptible strains than the singletons (p=0.007 and p<0.001, respectively). CC363 is a drug-resistant clone of clinical M. catarrhalis strains in China. Expansion of this clone under selective pressure of antibiotics should be noted and long-term monitoring should be established.
