Although, the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in Korea has declined owing to the eradication therapy, recent seropreva-lence of H. pylori infection is still reported to be as high as 54.4%. Until now, "standard regimen" for eradication of H. pylori has been conventional triple therapy consisting of proton pump inhibitor, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin. However, with the increase in antibiotic resistance, especially against clarithromycin, the eradication rate of conventional triple therapy has steadily declined during the past 13 years in Korea. Present eradication rate of standard triple therapy is reported to be less than 80%, which is the Maginot line of efficacy for the currently available regimen. Therefore, new first line eradication regimen is needed to enhance the eradication rate of H. pylori infection.
