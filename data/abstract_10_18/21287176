Proteomics has contributed to defining the specific functions of genes and proteins involved in plant-pathogen interactions. Proteomic studies have led to the identification of many pathogenicity and defense-related genes and proteins expressed during phytopathogen infections, resulting in the collection of an enormous amount of data. However, the molecular basis of plant-pathogen interactions remains an intensely active area of investigation. In this review, the role of differential analysis of proteins expressed during fungal, bacterial, and viral infection is discussed, as well as the role of JA and SA in the production of stress related proteins. Resistance acquired upon induction of stress related proteins in intact plant leaves is mediated by potentiation of pathogens via signal elicitors. Stress related genes extensively used in biotechnology had been cited. Stress related proteins identified must be followed through for studying the molecular mechanism for plant defense against pathogens.
