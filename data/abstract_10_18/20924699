The increasing drug resistance of Plasmodium falciparum is a worldwide problem. The objective of the study was the assessment of the in vitro activity of artemisinin, mefloquine and quinine, in an area where P. falciparum is multi-drug resistant. The sensitivity tests were based on measuring the drug-dependent inhibition of schizont maturation. For the 43 successfully tested isolates the mean effective concentrations (IC(50) and IC(90)) for artemisinin were 0.0081 and 0.1372 muM, respectively. For mefloquine the IC(50) was 0.1260 muM and the IC(90) was 3.7345 muM. Quinine showed an IC(50) of 0.2155 muM and an IC(90) of 2.5040 muM. All tested drugs showed a significant reduction in the effectiveness, compared with the results of former years. This suggests a further rise of resistance of local P. falciparum, which is alarming especially for artemisinin and quinine.
