BACKGROUND: Data comparing the clinical outcomes of telbivudine (LdT) and entecavir (ETV) in elderly patients with chronic hepatitis B are limited. GOALS: The aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy and renal safety of LdT and ETV in treatment-naive elderly (>/= 60 years) patients with chronic hepatitis B. METHODS: A total of 33 patients treated with LdT were consecutively enrolled in the study. Each patient was matched on the basis of age, sex, and baseline hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels with three to four randomly selected controls treated with ETV. RESULTS: Clinical characteristics were comparable between the two groups. Higher cumulative HBeAg-seroconversion rates were observed in the LdT group than in the ETV group after 2 years (50 vs. 20%) and 3 years (50 vs. 26.67%) of treatment (all P<0.0001). Virological response rate at week 24 was significantly lower in the LdT group than it was in the ETV group (54.55 vs. 70.87%, P<0.0001), but no significant difference was noted in long-term cumulative rates of undetectable HBV DNA levels between the two groups (P=0.562). Virological breakthrough occurred in six (18.18%) LdT patients, with no such cases reported in the ETV group (P<0.0001). Antiviral resistance was strongly associated with LdT use and the absence of undetectable HBV DNA at weeks 12 and 24 (P<0.0001). During the study, significant improvement was observed in the estimated glomerular filtration rate and model for end-stage liver disease score in LdT versus ETV group. CONCLUSION: LdT has a lower clinical efficacy for viral suppression and a higher risk of antiviral resistance than does ETV. However, LdT resulted in higher HBeAg-seroconversion rates and better renoprotective effects than did ETV.
