Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pn) is one of the main pathogens causing community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children. In Japan, macrolide (ML)-resistant M. pn was firstly isolated from clinical samples collected from pediatric patients with CAP in 2000, and the agents have rapidly increased. All ML-resistant strains had a point mutation in domain V of the 23S rRNA. Among the patients with ML-resistant M. pn, the duration of fever was significantly longer than in patients with ML-susceptible M. pn infection. The antimicrobial agent was often changed from ML as a first choice agent to minocycline or levofloxacin, because of unimproved clinical symptoms. Further clinical studies are needed to establish appropriate chemotherapy.
