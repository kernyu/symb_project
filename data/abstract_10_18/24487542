The study aimed to characterize the role of heavy metal micronutrients in swine feed in emergence of heavy-metal-tolerant and multidrug-resistant Salmonella organisms. We conducted a longitudinal study in 36 swine barns over a 2-year period. The feed and fecal levels of Cu(2+) and Zn(2+) were measured. Salmonella was isolated at early and late finishing. MICs of copper sulfate and zinc chloride were measured using agar dilution. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested using the Kirby-Bauer method, and 283 isolates were serotyped. We amplified pcoA and czcD genes that encode Cu(2+) and Zn(2+) tolerance, respectively. Of the 283 isolates, 113 (48%) showed Cu(2+) tolerance at 24 mM and 164 (58%) showed Zn(2+) tolerance at 8 mM. In multivariate analysis, serotype and source of isolates were significantly associated with Cu(2+) tolerance (P < 0.001). Fecal isolates were more likely to be Cu(2+) tolerant than those of feed origin (odds ratio [OR], 27.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.8 to 250; P = 0.0042) or environmental origin (OR, 5.8), implying the significance of gastrointestinal selective pressure. Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhimurium and Heidelberg, highly significant for public health, had higher odds of having >20 mM MICs of Cu(2+) than did "other" serotypes. More than 60% of Salmonella isolates with resistance type (R-type) AmStTeKm (32 of 53) carried pcoA; only 5% with R-type AmClStSuTe carried this gene. czcD gene carriage was significantly associated with a higher Zn(2+) MIC (P < 0.05). The odds of having a high Zn(2+) MIC (>/=8 mM) were 14.66 times higher in isolates with R-type AmClStSuTe than in those with R-type AmStTeKm (P < 0.05). The findings demonstrate strong association between heavy metal tolerance and antimicrobial resistance, particularly among Salmonella serotypes important in public health.
