Mycoplasma bovis is considered a major contributor to respiratory diseases in young cattle. Resistant M. bovis isolates have increasingly been reported worldwide due to extensive use of antimicrobials to treat bovine pneumonia. The frequency of isolates resistant to fluoroquinolones varies considerably from one country to another. The MICs of isolates collected in France have only increased from "very low" to "low." The present study was conducted to investigate whether alterations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) could account for this slight modification in susceptibility. No correlation between QRDR alterations and increased MICs was evidenced in clinical isolates. In addition, all clinical isolates were subtyped, and the tendencies of the different sequence types to develop resistance through mutations in QRDRs under selective pressure in vitro were examined. In vitro, 3 hot spots for mutations in QRDRs (position 83 in GyrA and positions 80 and 84 in ParC) were associated with a high level of resistance when cumulated. We showed that the point mutations in the QRDRs observed in vitro were different (in location and selection rapidity) between the different subtypes. Our in vitro observations were corroborated by the recent detection of a clinical isolate highly resistant to fluoroquinolones (MIC >/= 16 mug/ml) and belonging to the subtype which easily accumulates QRDR alterations in vitro. The current increased prevalence of this subtype in clinical isolates highlights the urgent need to control fluoroquinolone usage in veterinary medicine.
