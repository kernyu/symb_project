Acinetobacter baumannii is one of the most important bacterial species with the ability to produce OXA-type carbapenemases. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of OXA-type carbapenemases among clinical isolates of A. baumannii in three major hospitals of Isfahan. In this cross-sectional descriptive study, 153 non-repeated strains of A. baumannii were isolated from various clinical samples of hospitalized patients in Al-Zahra, Imam Mousa Kazem, and Shariati hospitals from October 2015 to October 2016. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing for imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem, cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, piperacillin-tazobactam, gentamicin, amikacin, ciprofloxacin, and tetracycline was performed using the disk diffusion method. In order to identify bla-oxa genes, a multiplex polymerase chain reaction was used. The resistance rates in A. baumannii isolates to beta-lactam antibiotics including imipenem, ertapenem, meropenem, cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and piperacillin/tazobactam were 100%, 100%, 99.3%, 97.4%, 96.7%, 97.4%, and 98.6%, respectively. PCR assay showed the presence of bla-oxa genes in all isolates. The bla-oxa-51 gene was recognized in all (100%) isolates, 90.8% and 62.1% of isolates possessed the bla-oxa-23 and bla-oxa-24 genes, respectively, while the bla-oxa-58 gene was not detected in any of the isolates. Also, 56.2% of isolates had both the bla-oxa-23 and bla-oxa-24 genes simultaneously. We found that the prevalence of OXA-type carbapenemases among carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii isolates is high in Isfahan, with OXA-23 being the major carbapenemase mechanism responsible for the resistance phenotype.
