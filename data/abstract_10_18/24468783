Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are either part of the current standard of care or are in advanced clinical development for the treatment of patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1, but concern exists with respect to the patients who fail these regimens with emergent drug-resistant variants. In the present study, ultradeep sequencing was performed to analyze resistance to daclatasvir (DCV), which is a highly selective nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) inhibitor. Eight patients with HCV genotype 1b, who were either treatment naive or prior nonresponders to pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (Rebetol; Schering-Plough) (PEG-IFN/RBV) therapy, were treated with DCV combined with PEG-IFN alpha-2b (Pegintron; Schering-Plough, Kenilworth, NJ) and RBV. To identify the cause of viral breakthrough, the preexistence and emergence of DCV-resistant variants at NS5A amino acids were analyzed by ultradeep sequencing. Sustained virological response (SVR) was achieved in 6 of 8 patients (75%), with viral breakthrough occurring in the other 2 patients (25%). DCV-resistant variant Y93H preexisted as a minor population at higher frequencies (0.1% to 0.5%) in patients who achieved SVR. In patients with viral breakthrough, DCV-resistant variant mixtures emerged at NS5A-31 over time that persisted posttreatment with Y93H. Although enrichment of DCV-resistant variants was detected, the preexistence of a minor population of the variant did not appear to be associated with virologic response in patients treated with DCV/PEG-IFN/RBV. Ultradeep sequencing results shed light on the complexity of DCV-resistant quasispecies emerging over time, suggesting that multiple resistance pathways are possible within a patient who does not rapidly respond to a DCV-containing regimen.
