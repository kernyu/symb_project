OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pathogen distribution and drug resistance in coal workers' pneumoconiosis associated with pneumonia and to provide a scientific basis for early guidance for rational clinical application of antibacterial agents. METHODS: Seventy-six patients with coal workers' pneumoconiosis associated with pneumonia who were admitted to our hospital from June 2011 to June 2014 were enrolled as subjects. The sputum specimens were aseptically collected for bacterial culture and drug sensitivity tests. RESULTS: In 245 sputum specimens collected from 76 patients, a total of 218 strains of pathogens, including 163 strains of Gram-negative bacilli (74.77%), 39 strains of Gram-positive cocci (17.89%), and 16 strains of fungi (7.34%) were isolated by bacteriological tests. The main Gram-negative bacilli had high rates of resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, cefotaxime, and aztreonam, and were sensitive to amikacin, imipenem, and meropenem. The main Gram-positive cocci had high rates of resistance to penicillin, erythromycin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefotaxime, and clindamycin, and were sensitive to vancomycin and teicoplanin. CONCLUSION: The main pathogens in these patients with coal workers' pneumoconiosis associated with pneumonia are Gram-negative bacilli, which are highly resistant to common clinically used antibacterial agents. The pathogen distribution and drug resistance should be well understood, and the antibacterial agents should be rationally selected according to the results of drug sensitivity tests.
