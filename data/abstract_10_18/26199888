Chronic non-healing venous ulcers are by their very nature colonized with bacteria. The amount and make up will vary based on many variables. The transition from colonization to contamination, critical colonization, and infection complicates the treatment of these ulcers. Silver has been shown to be an effective antimicrobial agent with a diverse antimicrobial footprint, minimal allergic reactions, and has been employed for over twenty-five years with little resistance being encountered. Based on these factors, this study was initiated to evaluate the impact of silver containing absorbent dressings on critically colonized venous leg ulcers.
