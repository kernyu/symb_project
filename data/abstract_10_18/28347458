Iron acquisition by bacteria and fungi involves in several cases the promiscuous usage of siderophores. Thus, antibiotic resistance from these microorganisms can be circumvented through a strategy of loading toxic metals into siderophores (Trojan Horse Effect). Desferrioxamine (dfo) and its cell-permeant derivative desferrioxamine-caffeine (dfcaf) were complexed with aluminum or gallium for this purpose. The complexes Me(dfo) and Me(dfcaf) (Me=Al(3+) and Ga(3+)) were synthesized and characterized by mass spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Their relative stabilities were studied through competitive equilibria with fluorescent probes calcein, fluorescein-desferrioxamine and 8-hydroxyquinoline. Me(dfo) and Me(dfcaf) were consistently more toxic than free Me(3+) against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans, demonstrating the Trojan Horse Effect. Wide spectrum antimicrobial action can be obtained by loading non-essential or toxic metal ions to microbes via a convenient siderophore carrier.
