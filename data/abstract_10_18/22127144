Drug efflux pumps have been one of the important mechanisms of drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. There is a prerequisite to study the behavior and mechanisms of these drug efflux pumps in detail for being considered in future anti-TB drug designing. The need of a rapid grower non-pathogenic mycobacterium with significant genomic homology for such type of studies is often being felt. During microarray and Real-Time PCR analysis of drug efflux pump genes of M. tuberculosis, we found 10 genes to be over-expressed during stress induced by common anti-TB drugs. In the present study homology analysis of these genes was done in order to know its phylogenetic relationship among other bacteria/mycobacteria. It was found that amino acid sequences of 7 out of 10 genes were significantly (>40%) identical to a non-pathogenic rapid grower environmental mycobacterium, Mycobacterium vanbaalenii. The protein sequences of M. vanbaalenii share important sequence motifs with M. tuberculosis useful for drug efflux mechanism based study across species. Like Mycobacterium smegmatis, it can be used as a model organism to study drug efflux pumps of M. tuberculosis and also other pathogenic mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium ulcerans and Mycobacterium marinum.
