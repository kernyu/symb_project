In Niger, malaria is a major public health problem, due to the high number of deaths that are attributable to it and because of its heavy weight and socioeconomic status. The objective of this study was to contribute to the inventory of medical practices to rationalize the use of medicines and minimize the resistance phenomenon. This is a prospective study, which took place from May 1 to July 31, 2009, in the pediatric ward of the National Hospital of Lamorde. It concerned children aged from 0 to 14 years hospitalized and having received one or more antimalarial drugs during at least 24 h. During the 3 months of the study, 1,248 children had been admitted in the department. Among them, 881 children received antimalarial treatment, i.e., 70.5% with prescriptions. Malaria was confirmed by microscopy in 410 children, i.e., 46.5% of the sick children received antimalarial treatment. Prescription control was deemed noncompliant in 258 patients, i.e., 29.3% of the total. Treatments based on microscopic diagnosis are one of the strategies that will help to streamline the use of antimalarial drugs to improve their effectiveness and efficiency and also to reduce the risk of emergence of resistance.
