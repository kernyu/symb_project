The important role of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in protective immunity in mycosis is well established, except for its participation in fungal granulomas. Herein, we employ immunohistochemical reactions to describe the in situ localization of IFN-gamma in granulomas of susceptible (B10.A) and resistant (A/J) mice to infection with Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (Pb). After infection with the highly virulent Pb18, IFN-gamma-positive lymphomononuclear cells were localized mainly at the periphery of granulomas in both mouse strains. The numbers of positive cells found in compact granulomas of A/J mice increased significantly from 15 to 120 days postinfection. At this time, significantly more positive cells were detected in the compact granulomas of resistant mice than in the loose, multifocal lesions of the susceptible ones. In infection with the slightly virulent Pb265, the same pattern of IFN-gamma localization was found as in Pb18 infection, but there was decreased staining at 120 days due to the presence of only residual lesions in both mouse strains. The marked IFN-gamma staining observed in the granulomas of resistant mice at the later stage of Pb infection confirms its importance in fungal dissemination control, and suggests a contribution to the development of paracoccidioidal granuloma.
