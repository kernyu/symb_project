OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate conjugative transfer of cephalosporin resistance among 100 strains of multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli (MDRE) to Salmonella enterica serotype Newport and E. coli DH5alpha recipients. METHODS: Phenotypic and genotypic profiles were determined for MDRE as well as for Salmonella Newport (trSN) and E. coli DH5alpha (trDH) transconjugants. RESULTS: Of 95 MDRE donor isolates, 26 (27%) and 27 (28%) transferred resistance to trSN and trDH recipients, respectively. A total of 27 MDRE (27%) were confirmed as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producers based on the double-disk synergy assay and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). WGS was performed on 25 of the ESBL-producing isolates, showing that 2 isolates carried blaCTX-M-6, 22 possessed blaCTX-M-32 and 1 was negative for blaCTX-M genes. Fourteen of the ESBLs sequenced were qnrB19. Differential transfer of IncA/C and IncN from MDRE32 was observed between trSN32 and trDH32. IncN-positive trDH32 displayed an ESBL phenotype, whereas IncA/C-positive trSN32 displayed an AmpC phenotype. The rate of ESBL transfer to trSN and trDH recipients was 11% and 96%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-seven MDRE were phenotypically identified as ESBL-producers. WGS of 25 MDRE revealed that 2 and 22 isolates carried blaCTX-M-6 and blaCTX-M-32, respectively. One multidrug-resistant isolate exhibited conversion from an AmpC phenotype to an ESBL phenotype with the transfer of only the IncN plasmid. The rate of resistance transfer to Salmonella or E. coli recipients was nearly identical. However, the ESBL phenotype was transferred with significantly greater prevalence to E. coli compared with Salmonella Newport (96% and 11%, respectively).
