Selective pressure from glycopeptide use has led to non-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus, including heterogeneously vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (hVISA). Treatment of hVISA infections with vancomycin has been associated with treatment failure, therefore new treatments are required. The objective of this study was to evaluate the activity of telavancin, vancomycin and linezolid against hVISA clinical strains. Twenty-five hVISA isolates were evaluated for minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) by microdilution and for bactericidal activity by time-kill analysis [starting inoculum ca. 10(6)colony-forming units (CFU)/mL and ca. 10(8)CFU/mL] against telavancin, vancomycin and linezolid. MICs for 50% and 90% of the organisms (MIC(50) and MIC(90) values, respectively) were, respectively, 0.5mg/L and 1mg/L for telavancin and 2mg/L and 2mg/L for both vancomycin and linezolid. In time-kill studies, telavancin was bactericidal against all strains at plasma peak and trough concentrations and at low and high inocula. At low inoculum, the time to bactericidal activity (defined as 99.9% kill from initial inoculum) (T(99.9)) for telavancin was 5.6 +/- 3.2 h at peak concentration and 12.3 +/- 5.2 h at trough concentration. This was superior to vancomycin (P<0.001), which had a T(99.9) of 18.8 +/- 2.1 h at peak concentration and 19.1 +/- 2.2 h at trough concentration. At high inoculum, telavancin had a T(99.9) of 16.3 +/- 3.2 h at peak concentration and 21.4 +/- 2.5 h at trough concentration, whilst vancomycin did not consistently achieve bactericidal activity. Linezolid was not bactericidal against any strain at either concentration or inoculum. In conclusion, the killing activity of telavancin against hVISA was found to be superior to vancomycin and linezolid.
