The objective in this study was to develop an osteoconductive, biodegradable and rifampicin releasing bone filling composite material for the treatment of osteomyelitis, a bacterial infection of bone that is very difficult and expensive to treat. The composite material will be used together with a ciprofloxacin releasing composite, because of the rapid development of resistant bacteria when rifampicin is used alone. Three composites were manufactured by twin-screw extrusion. The polymer matrix for the composites was poly(L-lactide-co-epsilon-caprolactone) 70/30 and all the composites contained 8 wt% (weight percent) of rifampicin antibiotic. The beta-TCP contents of the composites were 0 wt%, 50 wt% and 60 wt%. The composites were sterilized by gamma irradiation before in vitro degradation and drug release tests. The hydrolytical degradation of the studied composites proceeded quickly and the molecular weight of the polymer component of the composites decreased rapidly. Rifampicin release occurred in four phases in which the high beta-TCP content of the samples, polymer degradation and mass loss all played a role in determining the phases. The ceramic component was seen to have a positive effect on the drug release. The composite with 50 wt% of beta-TCP showed the most promising rifampicin release profile and it also showed activity against a common osteomyelitis causing bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A clear inhibition zone was formed in 16 h incubation. Overall, the tested materials showed great potential to be developed into a bone filler material for the treatment of osteomyelitis or other bone related infections in combination with the ciprofloxacin releasing materials.
