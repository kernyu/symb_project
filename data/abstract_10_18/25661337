Ribavirin is phosphorylated by adenosine kinase 1 (AK1) and cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase 2 and it is transported into cells by concentrative nucleoside transporters (CNT) 2/3, coded by SLC28A2/3 genes, and equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENT) 1/2, coded by SLC29A1/2 genes. We evaluated the association of some polymorphisms of IL28B, SLC28A2/3, SLC29A1, ABCB1, NT5C2, AK1, HNF4alpha genes and ribavirin treatment outcome and pharmacokinetics after 4weeks of therapy, in a cohort of HCV-1/4 Italian patients. Allelic discrimination was performed by real-time PCR; plasma concentrations were determined at the end of dosing interval (Ctrough) using an HPLC-UV method. Non response was negatively predicted by cryoglobulinemia and IL28B_rs12980275 AA genotype and positively by Metavir score; Metavir score, insulin resistance and SLC28A2_rs1060896 CA/AA and HNF4alpha_rs1884613 CC genotypes were negative predictive factors of SVR, whereas HCV viral load at baseline and IL28B_rs12980275 AA and rs8099917 TT genotypes positively predicted this outcome; RVR was negatively predicted by insulin resistance and positively by cryoglobulinemia and IL28B_rs12980275 AA genotype; Metavir score and insulin resistance were able to negatively predict EVR, whereas cryoglobulinemia and IL28B_rs12980275 AA genotype positively predicted it; at last, virological relapse was negatively predicted by IL28B_rs8099917 TT and AK1_rs1109374 TT genotypes, insulin resistance was a positive predictor factor. Concerning ribavirin pharmacokinetics, SLC28A2_rs11854488 TT was related to lower Ctrough levels; conversely patients with TC profile of SLC28A3_rs10868138 and SLC29A1_rs760370 GG genotype had higher ribavirin levels. These results might contribute to the clarification of mechanisms causing the individuality in the response to ribavirin containing therapy.
