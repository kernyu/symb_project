Current information on prevalence and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) of bacterial respiratory pathogens is crucial to guide antimicrobial choice for control and treatment of bovine respiratory disease (BRD). The objectives were to describe the prevalence of three BRD-associated bacteria (Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, and Histophilus somni) in the lower airways of feedlot cattle, and to analyze AMR in these bacteria. Cattle with (n=210) and without (n=107) BRD were sampled by trans-tracheal aspiration at four feedlots (Nov. 15-Jan. 16). These cattle had received 2.5mg/kg of tulathromycin on arrival at the feedlot for BRD control and two in-feed pulses of chlortetracycline (5g/animal/day for 5days) within the first 21days on feed to prevent histophilosis. Bacteria were detected by culture and AMR was tested by microdilution. Pasteurella multocida was the most frequent bacterium isolated in cattle with BRD (54.8%), followed by M. haemolytica (30.5%) and H. somni (22.9%). Compared to those with BRD, healthy cattle were less likely to be positive for P. multocida (OR=0.27), M. haemolytica (OR=0.32), or H. somni (OR=0.25). There were high levels of resistance (>70%) against tulathromycin and oxytetracycline in M. haemolytica and P. multocida isolates and high levels of resistance against oxytetracycline (67%) and penicillin (52%) in H. somni isolates. None or few isolates were resistant to florfenicol, enrofloxacin and ceftiofur. The high prevalence of resistance against tulathromycin and oxytetracycline suggests that these antimicrobials should not be repeatedly used for both control and treatment of BRD and/or histophilosis.
