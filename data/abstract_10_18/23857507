We evaluated second-line salvage therapy with adefovir + telbivudine (group 1), adefovir followed by adefovir + telbivudine (group 2), or lamivudine + adefovir followed by adefovir + telbivudine (group 3) in hepatitis B patients with an inadequate virologic response to lamivudine treatment. Simple linear regression analysis showed that for each additional month of treatment, the most significant reduction in viral load occurred in group 1 (HBV DNA [Log10 IU/mL]: group 1, -0.149; group 2, -0.081; group 3, -0.123). Generalized estimating equation analysis revealed that compared to group 1, hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels were 1.203 and 0.443 Log10 IU/mL higher in groups 2 and 3, respectively. Overall, a significant reduction in viral load (-0.060 Log10 IU/mL) was observed for each additional month of treatment. Adefovir + telbivudine treatment resulted in a significant reduction in HBV DNA levels. Moreover, telbivudine treatment resulted in a significant reduction in viral load (-0.050 Log10 IU/mL) compared to lamivudine treatment after the emergence of lamivudine resistance.
