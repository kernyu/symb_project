INTRODUCTION: The emergence of imipenem non-susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates is a matter of great concern because these isolates can become resistant to all available antibiotics. This study conducted to characterize beta-lactamase genes in imipenem resistant P. aeruginosa isolates from bloodstream. METHODS: 56 non-duplicate clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa were collected in Tehran hospitals. Antibacterial susceptibility was determined by disk diffusion and MIC methods. ESBL and MBL production was confirmed by combined disk. beta-Lactamase classes A, B and D genes were identified by PCR. RESULTS: Seventeen (30.3%) isolates were imipenem resistant for which 16 isolates simultaneously were resistant to all tested antibiotics. While among 39 imipenem susceptible isolates, only two isolates were resistant to all tested antibiotics. In imipenem resistant isolates, blaTEM, blaSHV and blaOXA-10 were found in 41.1% of isolates and blaVIM, blaIMP and blaPER were identified in 47%, 11.7% and 5.8% of isolates respectively, while in imipenem susceptible isolates, blaTEM, blaSHV and blaOXA-10 were determined in 2.5%, 7.6% and 33.3% of isolates, respectively. The imipenem resistant isolates had been recovered mostly (67.7%) from patients in the Burn hospital. CONCLUSION: The result of this study indicated the emergence of multidrug resistant MBL and non-MBL producing P. aeruginosa, particularly in the Burn hospital and blaVIM was dominant beta-lactamase genes in imipenem resistant isolates. The isolation of carrier patients may lead to prevent a further dissemination.
