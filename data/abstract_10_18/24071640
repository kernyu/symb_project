BACKGROUND: The incidence of vulvovaginal candidiasis, a common infection among healthy women primarily caused by the yeast Candida albicans, has increased significantly in recent years. AIMS: The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of ravuconazole (RVC) and fluconazole (FLC) in the treatment of experimental C. albicans vaginitis. METHODS: Forty isolates of C. albicans were screened for their in vitro susceptibility to RVC and FLC. A strain of C. albicans that was resistant to FLC (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] of >64 mug/ml) was selected for the in vivo study. Treatment regimens for the murine vaginal infection model were (1) 1, 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg RVC once daily, (2) 20 mg/kg RVC twice daily, (3) 20 mg/kg FLC once daily, and (4) 20 mg/kg FLC twice daily. RESULTS: The geometric means of the MIC values at 48 h for all isolates tested were 0.05 and 0.5 mug/ml for RVC and FLC, respectively. Regimens of either RVC or FLC at 20 mg/kg twice daily were more effective to reduce the load of FLC-resistant C. albicans than single dose administration. CONCLUSIONS: Complete eradication of C. albicans from the vagina was not observed with RVC or FLC treatment in the animal model, although RVC treatment showed a lower fungal concentration 14 days after drug administration.
