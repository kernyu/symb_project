Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica (S.) serovar Derby is one of the most prevalent serovars in pigs. Twenty-seven multiresistant S. Derby isolates, obtained at two pig slaughterhouses in Southern Brazil, were investigated for their molecular relationships, genotypic resistance and presence of class 1 and 2 integrons. All isolates shared the same XbaI-macrorestriction pattern and showed a common resistance genotype with resistance to streptomycin/spectinomycin (aadA variant), sulphonamides (sul1) and tetracycline [tet(A)]. They carried chromosome-located class 1 integrons with a new aadA gene variant, designated aadA26, as part of a gene cassette. The sequence of the flanking regions of this integron and the amplification of the merA gene may indicate the location of the class 1 integron into a Tn21-related transposon. The close relationships among these isolates and isolates from an earlier study suggest the persistence of a resistant clone of S. Derby in the pig production chain in Southern Brazil.
