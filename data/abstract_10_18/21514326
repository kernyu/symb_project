Antiviral monitoring of influenza viruses circulating in Italy has been carried out since 2007 by the National Influenza Centre (NIC), using both phenotypic and sequence-based assays. Here, we report results of the susceptibility evaluation to neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (NAIs, zanamivir and oseltamivir) and adamantanes of nearly 300 influenza type A and B seasonal viruses isolated in Italy during six recent seasons, together with over 30 pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus strains. The present work is the first such study conducted in Italy, aimed to develop national data on antiviral drug profile and to establish a nationwide surveillance programme on antiviral susceptibility. Sequencing of the NA gene was undertaken either to confirm the phenotypic findings or to identify any NA change, in potentially resistant viruses (outliers), which might be associated with reduced susceptibility to NAIs. The 50% inhibitory concentration values (IC(50)s) showed slightly different sensitivities of the seasonal Italian isolates to the two NAI drugs, depending on the specific NA subtype. We found mean zanamivir IC(50)s of 0.74, 1.33 and 7 nM, and oseltamivir IC(50)s of 0.67, 2.34 and 30.1 nM for the N2, N1 and B NAs, respectively. The pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses showed IC(50)values overall comparable to the seasonal N1 viruses from previous years, showing mean zanamivir IC(50)s of 1.02 nM and mean oseltamivir IC(50)s of 2.82 nM. Oseltamivir resistance was found in a total of 19 seasonal N1viruses of 2007/2008 and 2008/2009, and in three pandemic (H1N1) 2009 strains. A gradual increase of resistance to adamantanes was observed among the N2 viruses isolated in recent seasons; no resistant viruses were found among the seasonal N1 strains, whereas all the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 isolates analysed were resistant to the M2 blockers.
