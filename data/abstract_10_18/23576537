A novel commercial chromogenic technique, the betaLACTA test (Bio-Rad, Marnes-la-Coquette, France), was evaluated to detect nonsusceptibility to ceftazidime in Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. Easily implemented in the routine microbiology laboratory, this rapid test was sensitive (95%) and specific (87%) and presented negative and positive predictive values of 99% and 100%, respectively.
