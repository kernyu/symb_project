We aimed to describe the in vivo activity of humanized pharmacokinetic exposures of meropenem and comparators against Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) (VIM)-producing Enterobacteriaceae in a murine model. Levofloxacin activity was predicted by its MIC, and cefepime activity displayed variability, whereas meropenem produced a >1 log CFU reduction against all isolates despite high MICs indicative of resistance. Our results suggest that despite in vitro resistance, high-dose meropenem may be a possible option against infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae producing MBL-type carbapenemases.
