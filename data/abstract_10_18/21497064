Current dosing approaches for treating microbial infections ignore resistant subpopulations. A clinical isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured in a dynamic in vitro kill curve system designed to simulate the half-lives of drugs in order to evaluate the drug-microbial response relationship. The first dose of ciprofloxacin (CIP) uses a concentration equivalent to the unbound fraction of a 200mg clinical dose. A second dose of 200mg or 600 mg CIP, or ceftriaxone (CFX) or gentamicin (GEN) was administered at 12h. Dynamics of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were assessed using Etest strips before and throughout the CIP treatment period. In addition, the microbroth dilution method was used to evaluate drug susceptibility across a wide range of antibiotics using samples from before and after CIP exposure. A significant loss of CIP effects was observed at the second dose. Cross-resistance to many antibiotics (cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefotetan, ampicillin and ertapenem) was observed. GEN, but not CFX or high-dose CIP, was sufficient to suppress the developed resistant subpopulation following the initial CIP exposure. The CIP MIC increased substantially from 0.13 mug/mL pre dose to 4 mug/mL at 12h after a CIP dose. In addition, aztreonam induced a similar resistance pattern as CIP, indicating that induction of resistance was not limited to fluoroquinolones. In conclusion, the in vitro dynamic kill curve system revealed that aminoglycosides, more than other classes of antibiotics, were effective against the CIP-induced resistant subpopulations.
