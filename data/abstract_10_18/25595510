Raoultella planticola is a rare opportunistic pathogen usually invaded immunocompromised patients and sometimes even causes fatal infections. Recently, there is growing concern about the emergence of carbapenem resistance in this species. Here, we describe one case of hospital-acquired pneumonia due to a carbapenem-resistant R. planticola (CRRP) co-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. A literature review was performed to indicate the microbiological and clinical features of infections caused by CRRP.
