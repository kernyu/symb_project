Bacteria resistant to colistin, a last resort antibiotic reflect the pre-antibiotic era. In this study, colistin resistance carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (COL(R)- CRKP) strains from neonate's intensive care unit were evaluated. Molecular analysis showed that all the four colistin resistant K. pneumoniae isolates were clonally related with strong biofilm formation ability and harbored blaSHV-34 and blaOXA-48 genes. Our result suggested the need of proper surveillance and adequate infection control to limiting the spread of these organisms.
