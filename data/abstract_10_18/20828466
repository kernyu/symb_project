In the present study, a total of 225 retail meat products (poultry meat, ground beef, and beef samples) were tested for the prevalence of Salmonella. Of these, 50 (22.2%) were positive for Salmonella. Overall, the pathogen was detected in 22 (29.3%) samples of poultry meat (n = 75), 16 (21.3%) samples of ground beef (n = 75), and 12 (16%) samples of beef (n = 75). The most common isolate was Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (9.8%), followed by S. bongori species (8.9%) and S. enterica subsp. diarizonae (3.5%). The Salmonella strains isolated were also examined for antimicrobial resistance patterns and production of beta-lactamase enzyme. The resistance levels of the isolates against 14 different antimicrobial agents were tested by the disk diffusion method. None of the strains exhibited resistance to cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, or levofloxacin. However, the highest resistance rates in the meat isolates were 64% each for ampicillin and cephazolin and 56% for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. A total of 62% of the 50 Salmonella strains were multiresistant to three or more antimicrobial agents. The exhibited multiple resistance to four or more antimicrobial drugs was 32%. Furthermore, none of the isolates had beta-lactamase enzyme activity.
