BACKGROUND: Effective, pangenotypic treatments for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are needed. OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and efficacy of sofosbuvir with velpatasvir in patients infected with HCV genotypes 1 to 6. DESIGN: Randomized, phase 2, open-label study. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01858766). SETTING: 48 U.S. sites. PATIENTS: 377 treatment-naive noncirrhotic patients. In part A, patients infected with HCV genotypes 1 to 6 were randomly assigned to sofosbuvir, 400 mg, with velpatasvir, 25 or 100 mg, for 12 weeks. In part B, patients with genotype 1 or 2 HCV infection were randomly assigned to sofosbuvir, 400 mg, and velpatasvir, 25 or 100 mg, with or without ribavirin for 8 weeks. MEASUREMENTS: Sustained virologic response at 12 weeks (SVR12). RESULTS: In part A, SVR12 rates were 96% (26 of 27) with velpatasvir, 25 mg, and 100% (28 of 28) with velpatasvir, 100 mg, for genotype 1; 93% (25 of 27) in both groups for genotype 3; and 96% (22 of 23) with velpatasvir, 25 mg, and 95% (21 of 22) with velpatasvir, 100 mg, for genotypes 2, 4, 5, and 6. In part B, for genotype 1, SVR12 rates were 87% (26 of 30) with velpatasvir, 25 mg; 83% (25 of 30) with velpatasvir, 25 mg, plus ribavirin; 90% (26 of 29) with velpatasvir, 100 mg; and 81% (25 of 31) with velpatasvir, 100 mg, plus ribavirin. For genotype 2, SVR12 rates were 77% (20 of 26) with velpatasvir, 25 mg; 88% (22 of 25) with velpatasvir, 25 mg, plus ribavirin; 88% (23 of 26) with velpatasvir, 100 mg; and 88% (23 of 26) with velpatasvir, 100 mg, plus ribavirin. Adverse events included fatigue (21%), headache (20%), and nausea (12%). One patient committed suicide. LIMITATION: The study was open-label, no inferential statistics were planned, and sample sizes were small. CONCLUSION: Twelve weeks of sofosbuvir, 400 mg, and velpatasvir, 100 mg, was well-tolerated and resulted in high SVR in patients infected with HCV genotypes 1 to 6.
