Isolation of Candida non-albicans yeasts as commensals or pathogens from hospitalised hosts is acquiring increasing importance, due to the frequent drug resistance expressed by such organisms.Particularly, the recover of antifungal resistant C. guilliermondii is of worrisome concern, even if recovered as a saprophyte, since commensal yeasts may behave as reservoirs for resistance elements;furthermore, they may enter the bloodstream after chemotherapy-related mucosal damage has developed,thus causing life-threatening and difficult-to-treat fungemias. This communication deals with the unusual isolation of a pan-azole resistant C. guilliermondii strain from a leukaemic patient with silent candiduria and emphasizes the importance of monitoring less recurring species within the nosocomial setting to better understand fungal epidemiology within the wards and face the spread of resistance determinants. Also, we highlight the controversial significance of silent candiduria, clinical relevance of which should be investigated case by case, to exclude and/or prevent candiduria as well as renal impairment.
