OBJECTIVE: To compare the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of four antimicrobials in planktonic vs. biofilm-associated Staphylococcus pseudintermedius. STUDY DESIGN: In vitro study. SAMPLE POPULATION: 78 isolates from dogs colonized or infected with methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius (MRSP, n=39) or methicillin-susceptible S. pseudintermedius (MSSP, n=39). METHODS: Agar dilution was used to determine the MIC of amikacin, cefazolin, enrofloxacin, and gentamicin for planktonic bacteria. A modified broth microdilution assay was used to assess the MIC of biofilm-associated bacteria. RESULTS: MIC were significantly higher in biofilm-associated vs. planktonic bacteria for all antimicrobials; amikacin (median MIC: biofilm >2,000 mug/mL vs. planktonic 3 mug/mL, P<.0001), cefazolin (>1,000 vs. 0.5 mug/mL, P<.0001), enrofloxacin (>1,000 vs. 0.25 mug/mL, P<.0001), and gentamicin (>1,000 vs. 0.3 mug/mL, P<.001). For all antimicrobials, there were significant differences in planktonic MIC for MRSP and MSSP (all P<.0001) but no differences between biofilm MIC for MRSP and MSSP (P=.08-1.0). CONCLUSION: The MIC for biofilm-associated S. pseudintermedius are significantly higher than for planktonic bacteria. Standard methods for determining MIC are not appropriate for biofilm-associated infections. This must be considered when determining treatment regimens for infections that potentially involve biofilms, and further study of methods to control biofilm-associated infections is needed.
