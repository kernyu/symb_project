Paper sheets made from bagasse pulp have been modified using nanocellulose (NC) obtained from the same raw material. Modification of paper sheets have been carried out either through loading of paper with different concentrations of NC and antibacterial agent, Chitosan (Ch) during making sheets, or by surface coating of the paper. Crystals of NC extracted using concentrated sulfuric acid from bagasse pulp were found to have crystallinity index (CrI) 90%. Morphology of obtained NC has been confirmed by TEM and images revealed formation of NC crystals with large size distribution ranges from 4 to 60nm. Mechanical properties and air permeability of paper sheets loaded with different ratios of NC and Ch have been investigated. The results showed that presence of NC did not negatively affect the obtained modified paper sheets, while air permeability decreased with adding 8% NC to paper matrix. On the other hand, surface coverage of paper sheets with NC greatly reduced air permeability. Antimicrobial investigations carried out by optical density method indicated that presence of Ch in the paper sheets as an additive or in a coating formulation enhanced paper resistance to different microorganisms especially those causing food poisoning. The current study confirms that the modified paper can have potential application in food packaging.
