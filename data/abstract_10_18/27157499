A total of 405 Escherichia coli from the chicken production chains in Nigeria were investigated for ESBL-production and 4 isolates were identified as ESBL producers. They were characterized by XbaI-PFGE, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), phylotyping, sequencing of porin and regulatory genes and of the regulatory region of chromosomal ampC genes. Transformed ESBL gene-carrying plasmids were characterized by S1-nuclease, replicon typing, conjugation, digestion and PCRs for detection of the genetic environment of ESBL genes. Susceptibility testing, PCRs for the resistance genes, integrons, and the DNA microarray were performed with both, the original isolates and the transformants. All ESBL-producing isolates harboured blaCTX-M-15 genes located on non-conjugative plasmids (120-155kb). Three isolates with closely related/indistinguishable XbaI-patterns belonged to phylogroup A, and MLST sequence type ST10 and the fourth to phylogroup D and ST405. Resistance to aminoglycosides, sulfonamides/trimethoprim, quinolones, and tetracyclines were seen in all isolates. Incompatibility group IncFIB blaCTX-M-15-carrying plasmids were detected in the three related isolates which carried also a class 1 integron (aadA2-orfF-dfrA12) and the resistance genes blaOXA-1, blaTEM-1, aac(3')-IIa, aac(6')-Ib-cr, sul1, sul2, and tet(A). The IncFIA-IncFIB-IncI1 blaCTX-M-15-carrying plasmid harboured additionally the resistance genes aac(3')-IIa and tet(B). The blaCTX-M-15 genes were associated with ISEcp1 and Deltaorf477. ESBL-producing isolates showed elevated MICs to cefoxitin (16-64mg/L) and ertapenem MICs (0.5-2.0mg/L) mainly due to alterations in the porin genes. The virulence genes astA and prfB were detected. Although a low prevalence of ESBL-producing isolates was found, co-located resistance genes on the ESBL gene-carrying plasmids may facilitate the dissemination of them.
