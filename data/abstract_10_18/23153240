In recent years, quantitative real-time PCR tests have been extensively developed in clinical microbiology laboratories for routine diagnosis of infectious diseases, particularly bacterial diseases. This molecular tool is well-suited for the rapid detection of bacteria directly in clinical specimens, allowing early, sensitive and specific laboratory confirmation of related diseases. It is particularly suitable for the diagnosis of infections caused by fastidious growth species, and the number of these pathogens has increased recently. This method also allows a rapid assessment of the presence of antibiotic resistance genes or gene mutations. Although this genetic approach is not always predictive of phenotypic resistances, in specific situations it may help to optimize the therapeutic management of patients. Finally, an approach combining the detection of pathogens, their mechanisms of antibiotic resistance, their virulence factors and bacterial load in clinical samples could lead to profound changes in the care of these infected patients.
