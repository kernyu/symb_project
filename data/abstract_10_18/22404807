1. The objective was to evaluate the occurrence of cultivable components of the Bacteroides fragilis group in faeces of broiler chickens and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. 2. Faecal samples of 36 x 45-d-old Cobb broilers of both sexes from 15 different flocks on one farm were diluted 10-fold and plated on to Bacteroides-bile-esculin agar for colony count and isolation. Identification was by molecular methods and antimicrobial susceptibility in the agar dilution assay. 3. A total of 236 isolates was recovered from a mean population of 3.32 x 10(7 )colony-forming units/g of faeces. B. fragilis was shown to be the predominant Bacteroides species (45.3%), followed by B. distasonis (35.6%), B. vulgatus (8.9%), B. ovatus (2.5%) and B. stercoris (1.3%). 4. Among 204 bacterial isolates tested, high resistance to ampicillin (98.5%), norfloxacin (95.1%) and tetracycline (88.2%) were observed. High (89.7%) multi-drug resistance was observed to 3-7 of the tested drugs. 5. Components of the B. fragilis group were sub-dominant in broiler faecal microbiota, with a different species pattern compared with human and high antimicrobial multi-drug resistance.
