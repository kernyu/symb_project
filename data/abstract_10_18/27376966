Psoriasis commonly responds beneficially to UV radiation from natural sunlight or artificial sources. Therapeutic mechanisms include the proapoptotic and immunomodulating effects of UV, affecting many cells and involving a variety of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, downregulating the Th17/IL-23 response with simultaneous induction of regulatory immune cells. However, exposure to UV radiation in a subset of psoriasis patients leads to exacerbation of the disease. We herein shed light on the predisposing factors of photosensitive psoriasis, including genetics (such as HLA-Cw*0602 or CARD14), gender and coexisting photodermatoses such as polymorphic light eruption (PLE) in the context of potential molecular mechanisms behind therapeutic photoresponsiveness or photoaggravation. UV-induced damage/pathogen-associated molecular patterns, damage to self-coding RNA (signalling through Toll-like receptors), certain antimicrobial peptides and/or inflammasome activation may induce innate immunity, leading to psoriasis at the site of UV exposure when there is concomitant, predisposing resistance against UV-induced suppression of the adaptive immune response (like in PLE) that otherwise would act to reduce psoriasis.
