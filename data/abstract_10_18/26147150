In 2010 the Hellenic center for disease control and prevention launched the "Prokroustes" nationwide action plan to tackle the increasing rates of carbapenem resistance among gram-negative nosocomial pathogens. In the present report, data from a Greek tertiary-care hospital are presented three years after the adoption of the infection control measures. Carbapenem resistance rates have been contained for Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii but not for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. More worryingly, in accordance with their overuse against carbapenem-resistant bacteria, resistance rates to colistin and tigecycline have risen significantly.
