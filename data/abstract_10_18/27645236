Seven nonredundant ertapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were collected between May 2014 and 19 January 2015 in the nephrology and hematology units of Batna University Hospital in Algeria. All strains coproduced the blaOXA-48, blaCTX-M-15, blaSHV-1, and blaTEM-1D genes. Six of these isolates belonged to the pandemic clone sequence type 101 (ST101). The blaOXA-48 gene was located on a conjugative IncL/M-type plasmid. This is the first known outbreak of OXA-48-producing K. pneumoniae isolates involving an ST101 clone in Batna University Hospital.
