Escherichia coli clonal group A (CgA) causes disease in humans. This is the first study investigating the prevalence of CgA among E. coli from non-urine, extraintestinal infections in a northern European country. E. coli blood (n = 196) and paired urine (n = 195) isolates from the same patients with bacteraemia of urinary tract origin were analysed. The isolates were collected from January 2003 through May 2005 at four hospitals in Copenhagen, Denmark. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns, antimicrobial resistance and patient characteristics were determined for all CgA isolates; presence of virulence-associated genes (VAGs) and serotypes were determined for the blood CgA isolates. Thirty blood isolates (15%) belonged to CgA. CgA blood isolates were associated with female patients and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim resistance and they harboured a distinctive VAG profile. The blood and urine isolates from each pair were found to be related in 26 of 27 CgA blood/urine pairs, confirming a urinary tract origin of infection. Furthermore, a relationship between the PFGE patterns of CgA blood/urine isolates and CgA isolates from UTI patients in general practice and a CgA isolate from a community-dwelling human reported previously, was found, suggesting a community origin of CgA. The finding of CgA strains in 15% of the E. coli bloodstream infections with a urinary tract origin in Denmark suggests that CgA constitutes an important clonal lineage among extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli. A reservoir of this pathogenic E. coli group in the community causing not only UTI but also more severe infections such as bacteraemia has implications for public health.
