BACKGROUND: Despite frequent use of prophylactic antibiotics for patients undergoing transrectal prostate biopsy (TRPB), the incidences of urinary tract infection (UTI) and bacteria resistance are increasing. The aim of this study is to evaluate the current regimen of antimicrobial prophylaxis in TRPB. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed((R)), Embase((R)), and the Cochrane Library was performed to identify all randomized controlled trials (RCT) related to the effects of antibiotic prophylaxis for TRPB. The outcomes included bacteriuria, bacteremia, drug-resistant bacteria on urine/blood culture, fever, UTI, sepsis, and hospitalization. RESULTS: A total of 22 RCTs with 3846 patients were identified and included. Nine trials analyzed antibiotics versus placebo/no treatment, with all outcomes substantially favoring antibiotic use (p<0.05), including bacteriuria (risk ratio [RR] 0.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.15-0.42), bacteremia (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.49-0.92), fever (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.23-0.64), UTI (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.22-0.62), and hospitalization (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03-0.55). There were no substantial differences between long-course versus short-course treatment and single versus multiple dose respectively, except for a greater risk of bacteriuria for short-course treatment (RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.17-3.73, p=0.01) and single-dose treatment (RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.18-3.33, p=0.01). There were no substantial differences among the groups for bacteriuria, fever, UTI, and hospitalization, when comparing oral versus systemic administration of antibiotics. The efficacy of several classes of antibiotics was compared without any difference among them. Despite the lack of significance, the synthesized data of three RCTs indicated a trend towards the use of combined antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic antibiotics could be beneficial for the reduction of infective complications after TRPB. Single-dose or short-course oral administration with any type of antibiotic appears to be optimal. One additional type of antibiotic added to the basic antibiotic agent may contribute to the minimization of severe infection and drug resistance.
