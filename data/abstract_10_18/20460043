OBJECTIVE: To analyze antiviral effects of telbivudine in patients with chronic hepatitis B. METHOD: 72 chronic hepatitis B patients without prior history of antiviral therapy were treated with telbivudine 600mg once daily. RESULTS: At week 4, 37.5% of the patients achieved undetectable HBV DNA, and 33.3% achieved ALT normalization. At week 108, 87.5% of the patients achieved undetectable HBV DNA, and 91.7% achieved ALT normalization. HBeAg seroconversion occurred in 23.9% of the 46 HBeAg positive patients. The rates of undetectable HBV DNA and HBeAg seroconversion at week 108 in the patients with HBV DNA < 3 log(10) copies/ml at week 12 were significant higher than those in patients with HBV DNA >or= 3 log(10) copies/ml. The rate of undetectable HBV DNA at week 108 in the patients with HBV DNA < 3 log(10) copies/ml at week 24 was significantly higher than that in patients with HBV DNA >or= 3 log(10) copies/ml, and the rate of antiviral resistance rate at week 108 in the patients with HBV DNA < 3 log(10) copies/ml at week 24 was significantly lower than that in patients with HBV DNA >or= 3 log(10) copies/ml. Antiviral therapy could significantly improve Child-Pugh score in patients with liver cirrhosis. CONCLUSION: Telbivudine treatment results in suppression of HBV and high HBeAg seroconversion, and improvement of Child-Pugh score in the patients with liver cirrhosis.
