Brassinin is an antifungal compound induced in Brassica plants after microbial infection. Molecular evidence is incomplete, however, in supporting the importance of brassinin in plant resistance to pathogens. To test the importance of brassinin in plant defense, we studied the functions of the gene Bdtf1 in the necrotrophic fungus Alternaria brassicicola. Several strains of mutants of this gene were weakly virulent on Brassica species, causing lesions 70% smaller in diameter than the wild type on three Brassica species. These mutants, however, were as virulent as the wild type on Arabidopsis thaliana. They were similar to the wild type in spore germination, colony morphology, and mycelial growth in nutrient-rich media, both with and without stress-inducing chemicals. Unlike wild-type A. brassicicola, however, the mutants failed to germinate and their hyphal growth was arrested in the presence of 200 muM brassinin. When grown in a medium containing 100 muM brassinin, wild-type mycelium entirely converted the brassinin into a nontoxic derivative, of which the precise chemical nature was not established. Mutants of the Bdtf1 gene were unable to perform this conversion. Our results support the hypothesis that the ability of A. brassicicola to detoxify brassinin is necessary for successful infection of Brassica species.
