'Venture' and 'BabyGold 5' are two peach cultivars with a demonstrated resistance and susceptibility, respectively, to bacterial spot disease caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. pruni (Xcp). To explore the differences between these cultivars at the molecular level, two PR1 (Pp-PR1a, Pp-PR1b) and three PR5 (Pp-TLP1, Pp-TLP2 and Pp-TLP3) genes were isolated from peach (Prunus persica L.) and investigated by in silico and in situ approaches. The analysis of gene expression by qRT-PCR indicated that all PR genes, except Pp-PR1a, were induced to a significantly higher degree in the resistant cultivar. In response to signaling molecules, Pp-PR1a was induced chiefly by SA treatment, while other PR genes were induced mainly by ethephon or MeJA treatments. The induction of the same set of PR genes in response to bacterial infection, MeJA or ethephon suggests the involvement of jasmonic acid (JA)/ethylene (ET)-signaling pathways in mediating resistance against Xcp, which is consistent with the potential hemibiotrophic nature of this bacterium. The identification of binding sites for ERF and MYC2 transcription factors in the promoter of Pp-TLP1 and Pp-TLP2 genes further supported the role of JA/ET pathways in the transcription regulation of these genes. The role of stomata in defense against Xcp was also investigated by measuring stomatal apertures in both 'Venture' and 'BabyGold 5' leaves after 1 and 3 HPI. While most stomata closed in both cultivars within 1 HPI, stomata reopened again at 3 HPI with a higher percentage recorded for 'BabyGold 5', suggesting a potential role of stomata in the susceptibility of this cultivar.
