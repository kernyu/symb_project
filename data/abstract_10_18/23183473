BACKGROUND: One leading factor responsible for resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii, an important opportunist in health care institutions globally, is the production of carbapenamases like metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs), which hydrolyze a variety of beta-lactams including penicillin, cephalosporins and carbapenems. However, neither any standard guidelines are available nor any method has been found to be perfect for their detection. Various methods have shown discordant results, depending upon the employed methodology, beta-lactamase substrate and MBL inhibitor used. This study aims to evaluate two phenotypic methods against PCR as gold standard among carbapenem resistant A. baumannii for identifying MBL producers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 130 A. baumannii were screened for imipenem and meropenem resistance by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Phenotypic expression of MBL was detected by EDTA-imipenem-microbiological (EIM) assay and extended EDTA disc synergy (eEDS) test and presence of bla-IMP and bla-VIM was detected by PCR in all the carbapenem resistant isolates. RESULTS: Of the 43 imipenem and/or meropenem resistant A. baumannii isolates, 4 (9.3%) were found to be MBL producers by EIM and 3 (6.97%) by eEDS. Only bla-VIM gene was detected in 7 (16.28%) by PCR. In addition EIM detected 14 (32.56%) carbapenem resistant non-metallo enzyme producers. CONCLUSION: Of the two MBL genes targeted, bla-VIM was only detected and that too in isolates resistant to both imipenem and meropenem. Further, EIM was useful in differentiating MBL from non-metalloenzymes producers.
