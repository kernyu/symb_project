BACKGROUND: The prevalence of resistance to clarithromycin and metronidazole has considerably increased, with a corresponding decrease in the eradication rate for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. Primary resistance to amoxicillin is extremely low, and esomeprazole was found to exert a noteworthy antimicrobial activity in vitro against H. pylori. A dual therapy with high-dose of esomeprazole coupled with high-dose amoxicillin might be therefore an ideal first-line treatment for H. pylori eradication. We aimed to assess the efficacy of a first-line 10-day, high-dose dual therapy consisting of amoxicillin and esomeprazole to eradicate H. pylori infection. METHODS: Consecutive naive H. pylori-infected patients, who underwent an upper endoscopy in 4 Italian hospitals due to dyspeptic symptoms and found to be infected at routine histological assessment, were invited to participate. Patients enrolled received a 10-day, high-dose dual therapy comprising esomeprazole (40 mg t.i.d) and amoxicillin (1 g t.i.d.). At least 4 weeks after the end of the treatment a (13)C-urea breath test was performed to evaluate the eradication. RESULTS: A total of 56 patients agreed to participate in the study and were all followed-up. The overall eradication was 87.5% (95% CI=78.8*96.2), without a statistically significant difference among centres. Overall, 5 (8.9%; 1.5*16.4%) patients complained of side-effects. CONCLUSIONS: The 10-day, high-dose dual therapy with esomeprazole and amoxicillin might be an effective and safe first-line regimen. The efficacy of a longer 14-day regimen should be tested.
