The aim of the present study was to compare the potential of ceftobiprole, dalbavancin, daptomycin, tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin to achieve their requisite pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) targets against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates collected from intensive care unit (ICU) settings. Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to simulate the PK/PD indices of the investigated antimicrobials. The probability of target attainment (PTA) was estimated at minimum inhibitory concentration values ranging from 0.03 to 32 mug/mL to define the PK/PD susceptibility breakpoints. The cumulative fraction of response (CFR) was computed using minimum inhibitory concentration data from the Canadian National Intensive Care Unit study. Analysis of the simulation results suggested the breakpoints of 4 mug/mL for ceftobiprole (500 mg/2 h t.i.d.), 0.25 mug/mL for dalbavancin (1000 mg), 0.12 mug/mL for daptomycin (4 mg/kg q.d. and 6 mg/kg q.d.) and tigecycline (50 mg b.i.d.), and 2 mug/mL for linezolid (600 mg b.i.d.) and vancomycin (1 g b.i.d. and 1.5 g b.i.d.). The estimated CFR were 100, 100, 70.6, 88.8, 96.5, 82.4, 89.4, and 98.3% for ceftobiprole, dalbavancin, daptomycin (4 mg/kg/day), daptomycin (6 mg/kg/day), linezolid, tigecycline, vancomycin (1 g b.i.d.) and vancomycin (1.5 g b.i.d.), respectively. In conclusion, ceftobiprole and dalbavancin have the highest probability of achieving their requisite PK/PD targets against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolated from ICU settings. The susceptibility predictions suggested a reduction of the vancomycin breakpoint to 1 mug/mL.
