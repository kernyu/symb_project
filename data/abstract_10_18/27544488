Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major health issue around the world and HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitors have been the focus of intensive research for the past 20 years. From the first identification of substrate-derived peptide inhibitors to the complex, macrocyclic compounds, including paritaprevir and grazoprevir, that are currently available, the field has used structure-based design to confront the issues of potency, resistance and pharmacokinetics. Numerous breakthrough structures from a multitude of companies have led to compounds that are now key components of combination therapies with cure rates of >90%. Herein, we detail the compounds that have advanced to clinical trials including their design and their impact on the NS3/4a protease field.
