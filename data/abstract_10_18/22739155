Both tetrandrine (Tet) and 5-bromotetrandrine (BrTet) can effectively reverse P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated multidrug resistance (MDR). The structure of multidrug resistance associated protein 7 (MRP7) has its own specificity and difference compared with other members of the MRP family. This study was aimed to investigate whether Tet and BrTet can inhibit the expression level of MRP7 so as to further look into the mechanisms of the reversal effects of Tet and BrTet on MDR. The inhibitory effects of daunorubicin (DNR) used alone on the proliferation of K562 and K562/A02 cells were evaluated by MTT assay, the IC(50) of DNR and drug resistant folds were calculated. The mRNA level of MRP7 was tested by real-time PCR, and the protein levels of MRP7 and P-gp were tested by Western blot. The DNR accumulation was analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM). The results showed that the resistance of K562/A02 cells to DNR was 23.65-folds of that of K562 cells. After administration of 1 micromol/L Tet or 2 micromol/L BrTet, the mRNA level of MRP7 in the K562/A02 cells decreased to 2% and 12% respectively, and the protein level of MRP7 decreased by 53.2% and 83.7% respectively. The protein level of P-gp decreased by 58.47% and 52.20% in the 1 micromol/L Tet and 2 micromol/L BrTet groups. FCM detection showed that 1 micromol/L Tet and 2 micromol/L BrTet significantly increased the accumulation of DNR in K562/A02 cells by 94.32% and 271% respectively. It is concluded that Tet and BrTet both can reverse MDR in vitro. The mechanisms may be related to the inhibition of MRP7 overexpression and the increase of anticancer drug concentration in cells. At the same molar concentration, the effects of Tet and BrTet in inhibiting the protein level of MRP7 expression do not show significant difference.
