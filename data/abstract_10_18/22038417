Rice (Oryza sativa) cv. Nipponbare expresses non-host resistance (NHR) to the wheat leaf rust fungus, Puccinia triticina f. sp. tritici (Ptt). When the leaves of cv. Nipponbare were inoculated with Ptt, approx 93% of the urediniospores germinated on the leaf surface, but only 10% of the germinated spores formed appressoria over the stomata at one day post inoculation (1 dpi). Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) accumulated in host cells around the appressoria at 3 dpi. Approx. 3% of the appressoria produced short hyphae inside the leaf, and fluorescence was observed in tissue invaded by the hyphae by 7 dpi. At 22 dpi, 0.2% of the sites with appressoria formed branching infection hypha in mesophyll cells, but no substomatal vesicles, haustorial mother cells or haustoria were observed. Proteins were extracted from leaves 3 dpi and analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). A total 33 spots were reproducibly up-regulated and 9 were down-regulated by infection compared to the water inoculated control. Of these, 30 were identified by MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry. The identified proteins participate in defense/stress responses, energy/carbohydrate metabolism, oxidation-reduction processes, protein folding/turnover/cleavage/degradation, signal transduction and cell death regulation. The results indicates that NHR of rice to Ptt is consistent with a shift in protein and energy metabolism, increased antimicrobial activities, possibly including phytoalexin accumulation and cell wall reinforcement, increased cell repair, antioxidive and detoxification reactions, and enhanced prevention of plant cell death. Nearly half of the up-regulated identified proteins were associated with chloroplast and mitochondrial physiology suggesting important roles for these organelles during NHR.
