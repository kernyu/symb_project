GRL-02031 (1) is an HIV-1 protease (PR) inhibitor containing a novel P1' (R)-aminomethyl-2-pyrrolidinone group. Crystal structures at resolutions of 1.25-1.55 A were analyzed for complexes of 1 with the PR containing major drug resistant mutations, PR(I47V), PR(L76V), PR(V82A), and PR(N88D). Mutations of I47V and V82A alter residues in the inhibitor-binding site, while L76V and N88D are distal mutations having no direct contact with the inhibitor. Substitution of a smaller amino acid in PR(I47V) and PR(L76V) and the altered charge of PR(N88D) are associated with significant local structural changes compared to the wild-type PR(WT), while substitution of alanine in PR(V82A) increases the size of the S1' subsite. The P1' pyrrolidinone group of 1 accommodates to these local changes by assuming two different conformations. Overall, the conformation and interactions of 1 with PR mutants resemble those of PR(WT) with similar inhibition constants in good agreement with the antiviral potency on multidrug resistant HIV-1.
