In this study, the antibiotic susceptibilities to tigecycline and tetracycline of 35 selected Bacteroides fragilis group strains were determined by Etest, and the presence of tetQ, tetX, tetX1 and ermF genes was investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). tetQ was detected in all 12 B. fragilis group isolates (100%) exhibiting elevated tigecycline minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) (>/= 8 mug/mL) as well as the 8 strains (100%) with a tigecycline MIC of 4 mug/mL, whilst tetX and tetX1 were present in 15% and 75% of these strains, respectively. All of these strains were fully resistant to tetracycline (MIC >/= 16 mug/mL). On the other hand, amongst the group of strains with tigecycline MICs< 4 mug/mL (15 isolates), tetQ, tetX and tetX1 were found less frequently (73.3%, 13.3% and 46.7%, respectively). All but two strains harbouring the tetQ gene in this group were non-susceptible to tetracycline, with a MIC> 4 mug/mL. These data suggest that in most cases tigecycline overcomes the tetracycline resistance mechanisms frequently observed in Bacteroides strains. However, the presence of tetX and tetX1 genes in some of the strains exhibiting elevated MICs for tigecycline draws attention to the possible development and spread of resistance to this antibiotic agent amongst Bacteroides strains. The common occurrence of ermF, tetX, tetX1 and tetQ genes together predicted the presence of the CTnDOT-like Bacteroides conjugative transposon in this collection of Bacteroides strains.
