The Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein kinase Sch9 is an in vitro and in vivo effector of sphingolipid signaling. This study examines the link between Sch9 and sphingolipid metabolism in S. cerevisiae in vivo based on the observation that the sch9Delta mutant displays altered sensitivity to different inhibitors of sphingolipid metabolism, namely myriocin and aureobasidin A. Sphingolipid profiling indicates that sch9Delta cells have increased levels of long-chain bases and long-chain base-1 phosphates, decreased levels of several species of (phyto)ceramides, and altered ratios of complex sphingolipids. We show that the target of rapamycin complex 1-Sch9 signaling pathway functions to repress the expression of the ceramidase genes YDC1 and YPC1, thereby revealing, for the first time in yeast, a nutrient-dependent transcriptional mechanism involved in the regulation of sphingolipid metabolism. In addition, we establish that Sch9 affects the activity of the inositol phosphosphingolipid phospholipase C, Isc1, which is required for ceramide production by hydrolysis of complex sphingolipids. Given that sphingolipid metabolites play a crucial role in the regulation of stress tolerance and longevity of yeast cells, our data provide a model in which Sch9 regulates the latter phenotypes by acting not only as an effector but also as a regulator of sphingolipid metabolism.
