Antimicrobial resistance is an important issue in Belgium. For more than a decade, national projects aiming to promote the prudent use of antimicrobials and to decrease antimicrobial resistance in ambulatory, nursing-home and hospital settings have been launched by the Belgian Antibiotic Policy Coordination Committee (BAPCOC), coordinated by the Federal Public Service of Public Health, Food Chain Safety and Environment. In this paper, we describe the implementation of the e-Bug Project in Belgium by the University of Antwerp in collaboration with BAPCOC and supported by the Ministries of Education, and how e-Bug complemented a new national campaign focusing on antibiotic use in children first started on the European Antibiotic Awareness Day in 2008. We also describe the impact of the organization of education in Belgium on the implementation process, as well as plans for the future of e-Bug in our country.
