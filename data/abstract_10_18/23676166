A recent trial evaluating a 4-month regimen of standard drugs in adults with non-cavitary tuberculosis (TB) and negative cultures at 2 months failed to demonstrate equivalence compared to the same regimen given for 6 months. To contribute further evidence, data from two trials conducted by the British Medical Research Council (BMRC) comparing 4 and 6 month regimens were re-analysed. The results from the BMRC trials in patients with non-cavitary TB and negative cultures at 2 months were consistent with those from the recent trial. However, given that there was no acquired drug resistance, the estimated 6.6% relapse rate (95%CI 4.3-10.1) across all three trials might be considered acceptable for a 4-month regimen in patients with non-cavitary pulmonary TB.
