The advantages and disadvantages of various antibiotics used in the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) are compared with respect to their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Recommendations are made for their optimal use in clinical practice. Metronidazole is suitable for the treatment of mild forms of CDI which are essentially self-limiting. Vancomycin kills clostridia reliably but the treatment is encumbered with considerable risk of recurrence. This can be decreased by shortening the treatment to seven days and then switching to a (pulse, taper, chaser) regimen to prevent recurrence or by active restoration of the intestinal ecosystem (fecal transplant). Fidaxomicin works faster than vancomycin and is associated with a lower risk of recurrence. Thus, it can be profitably used in patients with impending ileus and also in those whose medical condition does not allow prolonged treatment. The duration of fidaxomicin treatment could be reduced to as few as five days. Rifaximin does not have a clear place in the treatment of CDI because no compelling data are available on its efficacy in this disease. The risk of resistance is also important. Tigecycline is a promising antibiotic for parenteral use. According to the available data, it should be more effective than intravenous metronidazole which has been considered the drug of choice.Clostridial colitis is associated with intestinal dysmicrobia which is the major cause of recurrence. Severe dysmicrobia cannot be treated by antibiotics but only by gut flora restoration; stool transplant from a healthy donor is the only proven therapy for this condition.
