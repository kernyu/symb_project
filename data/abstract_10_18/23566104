Enzyme targets in rapidly replicating systems, such as retroviruses, commonly respond to drug-selective pressure with mutations arising in the active site pocket that limit inhibitor effectiveness by introducing steric hindrance or by eliminating essential molecular interactions. However, these primary mutations are disposed to compromising pathogenic fitness. Emerging secondary mutations, which are often found outside of the binding cavity, may or can restore fitness while maintaining drug resistance. The accumulated drug pressure selected mutations could have an indirect effect in the development of resistance, such as altering protein flexibility or the dynamics of protein-ligand interactions. Here, we show that accumulation of mutations in a drug-resistant HIV-1 protease (HIV-1 PR) variant, D30N/M36I/A71V, changes the fractional occupancy of the equilibrium conformational sampling ensemble. Correlations are made among populations of the conformational states, namely, closed-like, semiopen, and open-like, with inhibition constants, as well as kinetic parameters. Mutations that stabilize a closed-like conformation correlate with enzymes of lowered activity and with higher affinity for inhibitors, which is corroborated by a further increase in the fractional occupancy of the closed state upon addition of inhibitor or substrate-mimic. Cross-resistance is found to correlate with combinations of mutations that increase the population of the open-like conformations at the expense of the closed-like state while retaining native-like occupancy of the semiopen population. These correlations suggest that at least three states are required in the conformational sampling model to establish the emergence of drug resistance in HIV-1 PR. More importantly, these results shed light on a possible mechanism whereby mutations combine to impart drug resistance while maintaining catalytic activity.
