In the European component of the Regional Resistance Surveillance study for 2011, a total of 21 countries were monitored for antimicrobial resistance patterns including Belgium, Bulgaria (BU), Croatia, Czech Republic, France (F), Germany (GE), Greece (GR), Ireland (IR), Israel (IS), Italy (IT), Poland (PO), Portugal (PT), Romania (RO), Russia (RU), Slovakia (SK), Slovenia, Spain, Sweden (SW), Turkey (T), Ukraine, and United Kingdom. Results from testing 12,572 strains (100 [BU] to 1535 [F] per nation) were interpreted by contemporary published breakpoints. Samples from 47 hospitals were reference tested against agents such as amikacin (AMK), cefoperazone/sulbactam (C/S), colistin (COL), levofloxacin, linezolid (LZD), tigecycline (TIG), vancomycin (VAN), and 21 others. Among Staphylococcus aureus, LZD (MIC90, 2 mug/mL), TIG (MIC90, 0.12 mug/mL), and VAN (MIC90, 1 mug/mL) exhibited complete coverage and methicillin resistance rates among nations (average, 31%) ranged from 0.9% (SW) to 60.0-60.2% (PT, SK). Seven LZD-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (only 1.1% resistance overall) were noted in 5 nations, and a Staphylococcus simulans strain (MIC, 8 mug/mL from RO) had L3 mutations (N130D, G152A, F147S, A157R); also 6 LZD-resistant enterococci were detected in 3 countries (GE, IR, T). VAN-resistant enterococci (10% overall; 84% VanA) were found in 14 countries, highest in GE and IR (23.0%). The ESBL phenotype rate for Escherichia coli was 20.1% (range, 0.9% [SW] to 70.0-89.7% [BU, RU]), best inhibited by COL (100.0% S), TIG (100.0%), AMK (83.3-94.1%), C/S (81.0%), and carbapenems (>99.0%; resistant strains in IS and T). Klebsiella spp. had greater ESBL rates (45.7% overall, range 2.5-100.0%), as well as carbapenem resistance (8.3% overall, greatest in BU, GR, IS, IT, PO, RO, RU, T). Non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter [ACB]) were generally less susceptible, except against COL (99.2-99.6% S) and TIG (95.0% inhibited at </=2 mug/mL; ACB only). The following carbapenemases were detected: VIM-1 (2 countries); IMP-1 (1 from T); KPC-2 or -3 (2 countries); VIM-4 (1 from PO), NDM-1 (2 in RO; 2 centers); and OXA-48 or -162 (5 from T; 2 centers). European surveillance sampling demonstrates a wide array of resistant isolates, less prevalent among Gram-positive cocci that remain inhibited by several available agents. However, beta-lactamase-mediated mechanisms have spread widely among Gram-negative bacilli, especially across the Eastern and Southern European nations, severely limiting infection chemotherapy and necessitating escalated antimicrobial stewardship.
