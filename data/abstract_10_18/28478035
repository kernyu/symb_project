The Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 integrase is responsible for the covalent insertion of a newly synthesized double-stranded viral DNA into the host cells, and is an emerging target for antivirus drug design. Raltegravir (RAL) and elvitegravir (EVG) are the first two integrase strand transfer inhibitors used in therapy. However, treated patients eventually develop detrimental resistance mutations. By contrast, a recently approved drug, dolutegravir (DTG), presents a high barrier to resistance. This study aims to understand the increased efficiency of DTG upon focusing on its interaction properties with viral DNA. The results showed DTG to be involved in more extended interactions with viral DNA than EVG. Such interactions involve the halobenzene and scaffold of DTG and EVG and bases 5'G(-4)3', 3'A(3)5'and 3'C(4)5'.
