Pasteurella multocida has been recognized as an important veterinary pathogen for over a century. Conventional methods for diagnosis of pasteurellosis rely on the detection of the organism by microscopy and its isolation and identification. However, as far as pasteurellosis is concerned, it is not just sufficient to know the identity of the organism. To constitute effective control measures, it is important to know the serotype of the organism. A study was undertaken to characterize the Pasteurella isolates from local pigs in India with clinical respiratory disease by determination of their capsule types and presence or absence of toxin gene. Pasteurella could be isolated from 66.70% of pigs with clinical respiratory disease. All the isolates were confirmed through biochemical characterization and P. multocida-specific polymerase chain reaction. It has also been observed that all the isolates belonged to capsular type D. All the isolates were sensitive to chloramphenicol, chlortetracycline, doxycycline, and enrofloxacin, while the rest of the antibiotics were less effective. It has also been observed that all isolates were resistant to cephalexin, penicillin G, and sulphadiazine. The study revealed the detection of P. multocida serotype D from clinical respiratory diseases of local pigs of India, which could be one of the important respiratory tract pathogens responsible for mortality of local pigs in India.
