AIM: Analysis of taxonomic structure and bioprofile of staphylcocci--causative agents of cutaneous and ophthalmic forms of perinatal infectious-inflammation pathology (IIP) in Orenburg neonates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bacteriologic study in 308 neonates with clinical signs of cutaneous and ophthalmic forms of perinatal IIP was carried out with isolation of microorganisms from lesions and their species (genus) identification by generally accepted methods. The presence of hemolytic, anti-lysozyme, activity, ability to form biofilms, resistance to antimicrobial cationic peptides of human leukocytes (intercid) and thrombocytes (trombodefensins), sensitivity to antibiotics were determined in the isolated staphylococci strains. RESULTS: Staphylococci dominated in the structure of causative agents of cutaneous and ophthalmic forms of perinatal IIP (76.2%) and among those coagulase-negative staphylococci had a priority position (82.4 +/- 3.4%). Staphylococci had a distinctive pathogenic potential and frequently had antibiotic resistance. CONCLUSION: Perinatal IIP is examined as a variant of endogenous bacterial infection. The necessity of microbiologic monitoring for development of effective approaches to therapy and prophylaxis of perinatal IIP is justified.
