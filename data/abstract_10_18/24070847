We investigated the susceptibility of Candida albicans isolated from clinic specimens to azole antifungal agents and estimated the association of the ERG11 mutations with azole resistance during recent 5years in China. In this study, novel mutations G346A, A434V, and L480F in ERG11 may be related to azole resistance in C. albicans.
