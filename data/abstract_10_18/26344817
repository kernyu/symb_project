OBJECTIVES: The use of pneumococcal antigen urinary tests is substantially increasing and is associated with a significant cost. The relevant use of this test in the intensive care unit (ICU) should be better defined. Our aim was to define the role of this test in relation to other microbiological tests. We described a series of patients admitted to the ICU for an invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective and descriptive study of the microbiological tests used to diagnose IPD in patients admitted to the ICU of the University Hospital in Bordeaux. Our aim was to measure the sensitivity of these bacteriological tests and of the BinaxNOWS. pneumoniae test. RESULTS: Between 2009 and 2013, 148 patients were admitted for an IPD. A lower respiratory tract infection was diagnosed in 96.6% of them (143 patients). The overall ICU case fatality rate was 17.6%. The sensitivity of the pneumococcal antigen urinary test, sputum bacteriological examination, and blood cultures was respectively 83%, 37.6%, and 29.7%. S. pneumoniae was isolated from at least one bacteriological sample in 48.6% of patients, but in 51.4%, the diagnosis was only based on the results of the pneumococcal antigen urinary test. CONCLUSION: We suggest performing a pneumococcal antigen urinary test when an IPD is suspected, only if the bacteriological tests are still negative after 48hours. This strategy would result in a substantial cost saving. Patients would not face any additional risks as the result of the pneumococcal antigen urinary test does not have any impact on the initially prescribed antibiotic therapy.
