Klebsiella pneumoniae has become one of the most dangerous causative agents of hospital infections due to the acquisition of resistance to carbapenems, one of the last resort families of antibiotics. Resistance is usually mediated by carbapenemases coded for by different classes of genes. A prolonged outbreak of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae infections has been recently described in northeastern Ohio. Most strains isolated from patients during this outbreak belong to MLST sequence type 258 (ST258). To understand more about this outbreak two isolates (strains 140 and 677), one of them responsible for a fatal infection, were selected for genome comparison analyses. Whole genome map and sequence comparisons demonstrated that both strains are highly related showing 99% average nucleotide identity. However, the genomes differ at the so-called high heterogeneity zone (HHZ) and other minor regions. This study identifies the potential value of the HHZ as a potential marker for K. pneumoniae clinical and epidemiological studies.
