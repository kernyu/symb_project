Aspergillus species are the most common causes of invasive mold infections in immunocompromised patients. The introduction of new antifungal agents and recent reports of resistance emerging during treatment of Aspergillus infections have highlighted the need for in vitro susceptibility testing. Various testing procedures have been proposed, including macro- and micro-dilution, disk diffusion, Etest (AB Biodisk, Sweden) and other commercial tests. Although Aspergillus species are generally susceptible to various compounds, intrinsic and acquired resistance has been documented. Amphotericin B has limited activity against Aspergillus terreus and Aspergillus nidulans. Not surprisingly, continued use of azole-based drugs has the undesirable consequence of elevating the resistance of subsequent isolates from these patients. Several species in the Aspergillus fumigatus complex appear to be resistant to azoles; there is evidence of in vitro and in vivo correlation. Each in vitro susceptibility testing method has its own advantages and disadvantages. Etest is easy to perform and use on a daily basis, yet it is expensive. Disk diffusion is the most attractive alternative method to date, yet we lack sufficient data for aspergilli. The European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) and the Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) have produced reproducible reference testing methods. This article reviews the available methods for antifungal susceptibility testing in Aspergillus spp. as well as the scant data regarding the clinical implications of in vitro testing.
