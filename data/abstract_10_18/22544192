In 2009, World Health Organization human immunodeficiency virus drug resistance early warning indicator monitoring was piloted at 2 large antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinics in Papua New Guinea: Heduru Clinic in Port Moresby and Tininga Clinic in Mount Hagen. Results demonstrated that both Heduru and Tininga clinics met internationally suggested targets for prescribing appropriate first-line ART regimens in accordance with national ART guidelines, retention on first-line ART at 12 months, and drug supply continuity. However, both clinics failed to achieve suggested targets for rates of loss to follow-up and on-time pill pickup. Reasons for poor clinic performance on loss to follow-up and on-time pill pickup were explored, and appropriate corrective actions were implemented.
