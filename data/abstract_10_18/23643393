The fluoroquinolones (FQs) are important agents for the treatment of mycobacterial infections. In leprosy, the use of FQs has enabled a dramatic shortening of formerly long and complicated therapy. Both animal and human studies support the inclusion of certain FQs as a cornerstone of leprosy therapy. In tuberculosis (TB), particularly in multidrug-resistant (MDR) infections, the place of the major antimycobacterial FQs is less clear as there is widespread resistance to these agents in areas of the world in which MDR-TB and extensively drug-resistant (XDR)-TB are prevalent, particularly in Southeast Asia. The place of the newly developed FQ-related diarylquinoline compound known as bedaquiline in the treatment of drug-resistant TB is unclear; however, human studies suggest that it might be effective for this indication.
