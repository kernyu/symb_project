We evaluated FKS1 and FKS2 mutations in Candida parapsilosis bloodstream isolates and correlated them with the echinocandin MIC values determined by guidelines in CLSI document M27-A3 and the YeastOne panel. All mutations detected were outside hot spot (HS) regions. The F1386S mutation detected in an isolate that was resistant by the YeastOne panel but not by the M27-A3 guidelines might be implicated in echinocandin resistance. Further studies are needed to confirm the implication of the F1386S mutation and to elucidate the capability of the M27-A3 guidelines to detect echinocandin resistance.
