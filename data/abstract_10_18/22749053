The Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART) is an international surveillance study designed to monitor resistance trends among aerobic and facultative Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) isolated from intra-abdominal infections. During 2003-2010, a total of 20710 GNB isolates were collected at medical centers in China, Hong Kong, Korea, New Zealand, and Taiwan. The susceptibility profiles of 2252 isolates of non-Enterobacteriaceae GNB were determined. At least 10 isolates of a given organism were required for that organism to be included in the analysis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the leading organism (49.2% of non-Enterobacteriaceae GNB), followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (21.5%), Aeromonas spp. (11.6%), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (9.1%). All the other species/genera made up less than 2%. The rates of susceptibility of the four major organisms were examined for two different time periods and according to whether the isolates had been obtained <48 h after hospitalization or >/= 48 h after hospital admission. P. aeruginosa, Aeromonas spp., and S. maltophilia showed sustained levels of susceptibility to several antimicrobial agents in the two time periods, whereas A. baumannii exhibited very high rates of resistance to most antimicrobial agents including imipenem. Nosocomial P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii were more resistant than community-acquired pathogens, although this was not the case for Aeromonas spp. and S. maltophilia. Worldwide and regional surveillance is necessary to guide empirical antimicrobial therapy for infections due to non-Enterobacteriaceae GNB.
