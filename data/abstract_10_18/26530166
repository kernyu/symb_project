The cytoprotective role of heat shock proteins (HSPs) has been demonstrated in various cell types however, only few studies have investigated the role of extracellular exposure to HSPs in the survival of human lymphoma cell line U937. In the present study, we investigated the effect of extracellular exposure to four HSPs (HSP90, HSP70, HSP60, and HSP47) on apoptotic cell death induced by either oxidative stress (hydrogen peroxide) or endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated intracellular calcium overload. It was found that extracellular exposure to HSPs reduced the cytotoxicity induced by hydrogen peroxide, but not that evoked by thapsigargin (a specific inhibitor of cytosolic calcium reuptake which is able to induce endoplasmic reticulum stress with subsequent intracellular calcium overload). Similarly, it was observed that exogenous HSPs were able to suppress the caspase-3 activation induced by hydrogen peroxide. These findings indicate that extracellular HSPs increase the resistance of human lymphoma cell line U937 to apoptotic cell death induced by hydrogen peroxide and diminish oxidative stress-mediated injures.
