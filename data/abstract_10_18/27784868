Cefsulodin-irgasan-novobiocin agar (CIN) has been used as a selective agar to detect Yersinia in food or human patients; however, its components can inhibit the growth of some strains of Yersinia enterocolitica serovar O3 and Y. pseudotuberculosis. Recently, a new Yersinia selective agar, CHROMagar Yersinia enterocolitica (CAYe), was developed and evaluated as a novel selective agar for pathogenic Y. enterocolitica. In this research, a total of 251Yersinia strains (176 pathogenic Y. enterocolitica, 59 Y. pseudotuberculosis, and 16 non-pathogenic Yersinia) were cultured on both CIN and CAYe for comparison. Except for 10 of 104 pathogenic Y. enterocolitica O3 strains and 59 Y. pseudotuberculosis strains, 198 Yersinia isolates grew on both media after 48 hr of incubation at 32. Of the 10 pathogenic Y. enterocolitica O3 which could not grow on CIN or CAYe, 9 strains could not grow on CIN with supplements and 1 strain could not grow CAYe with supplements. Of 9 strains which did not grow on CIN with supplements, 3 strains could not grow on CIN without supplements. However, 1 strain which did not grow on CAYe with supplements could grow on CAYe without supplements. All of the Y. pseudotuberculosis strains could grow on CIN with/without supplements and on CAYe without supplements. The results indicate that the inhibition of the growth of Y. enterocolitica O3 on CIN is related to the components of CIN; however, the inhibition on CAYe appears to be related to the supplements in CAYe. Therefore, CAYe may be a more useful selective medium than CIN for pathogenic Y. enterocolitica .
