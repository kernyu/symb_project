In the present study, we report on the reduced susceptibility to teicoplanin among clinical isolates of Staphylococcus haemolyticus in a hematology ward of a teaching hospital. The molecular characterization of 17 S. haemolyticus strains was performed using mec gene complex classification, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis, and minimum inhibitory concentration examination. Pulsotype A strains carrying a class C2 mec gene complex were the most prevalent strains, at 64.7%. In vivo selection of stepwise increase in resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin was observed in three S. haemolyticus strains serially isolated from a case patient. The results of the present study suggest the regional spread of certain S. haemolyticus clones with diminished susceptibility to glycopeptides, emphasizing the need for continuous monitoring of minimum inhibitory concentration levels of vancomycin and teicoplanin in S. haemolyticus strains, and the importance of infection control practices to prevent its transmission.
