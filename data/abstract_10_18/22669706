PURPOSE: Previous research showed that mutations in beta1-tubulin are frequently involved in paclitaxel resistance but the question of whether the mutations are restricted by cell-type specific differences remains obscure. METHODS: To circumvent cellular constraints, we randomly mutagenized beta-tubulin cDNA, transfected it into CHO cells, and selected for paclitaxel resistance. RESULTS: A total of 26 beta1-tubulin mutations scattered throughout the sequence were identified and a randomly chosen subset were confirmed to confer paclitaxel resistance using site-directed mutagenesis of beta-tubulin cDNA and transfection into wild-type cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy and biochemical fractionation studies indicated that cells expressing mutant tubulin had decreased microtubule polymer and frequently suffered mitotic defects that led to the formation of large multinucleated cells, suggesting a resistance mechanism that involves destabilization of the microtubule network. Consistent with this conclusion, the mutations were predominantly located in regions that are likely to be involved in lateral or longitudinal subunit interactions. Notably, fourteen of the new mutations overlapped previously reported mutations in drug resistant cells or in patients with developmental brain abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: A random mutagenesis approach allowed isolation of a wider array of drug resistance mutations and demonstrated that similar mutations can cause paclitaxel resistance and human neuronal abnormalities.
