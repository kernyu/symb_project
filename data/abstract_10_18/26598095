Although antimicrobials are commonly used in children, it is important to remember that they can have a profound impact on this unique patient population. Inadvertent consequences of antiinfective use in children include antimicrobial resistance, infection caused by Clostridium difficile, increased risk of obesity, and adverse drug events. In addition, compared with adults, children have different dosing requirements, antimicrobial formulation needs, pharmacokinetics, and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles. Therefore, pediatric-specific antimicrobial stewardship efforts are needed to promote appropriate use of antimicrobials in children. The primary purposes of this review article are to provide a rationale behind pediatric-focused antimicrobial stewardship and to describe currently available evidence regarding the initiatives of pediatric antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs). A literature search of the Medline database was performed (from inception through March 2015). The studies included in this review focus on antimicrobial stewardship interventions in inpatient pediatric settings. Ten inpatient studies involving pediatric-focused antimicrobial stewardship interventions were identified from the published literature. Four studies used the core strategy of prospective audit with feedback; two used prior approval. The remaining four used supplemental antimicrobial stewardship strategies (guidelines, clinical pathways, and computerized decision support tools). In general, the interventions resulted in decreased antimicrobial use, reduced antimicrobial costs, and fewer prescribing errors. Children have unique medical needs related to antimicrobials and deserve focused ASP efforts. The literature regarding pediatric antimicrobial stewardship interventions is limited, but published interventions may serve as paradigms for developing pediatric ASPs as demonstrated by the general success of these interventions.
