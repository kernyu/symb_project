INTRODUCTION: The emergence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) infections requires therapeutic tool reassessment. We report the efficacy of a cefoxitin-based antibiotic therapy for ESBL-E prostatitis. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study including patients with ESBL-E prostatitis, resistant to cotrimoxazole and fluoroquinolones from January 2014 to March 2016. Cefoxitin was administered by continuous infusion for three weeks in the case of acute prostatitis or six weeks in the case of chronic prostatitis with intravenous fosfomycin for the first five days. Urological investigations were performed to diagnose underlying urinary tract pathology. Clinical and microbiological efficacy was evaluated three months (M-3) and six months (M-6) after the end of therapy. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were included; the median age was 74 years [48-88]. There were 14/23 (61%) chronic infections and 12/23 (52%) health-care associated infections. The bacteria involved were Escherichia coli in 11 cases, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 10 cases and K. oxytoca in 2 cases. We observed a clinical cure in 19/23 (83%) patients at M-3 and 17/22 (77%) at M-6. Urocultures at M-3 and M-6 were sterile in 13/23 patients (56%) and 9/19 patients (47%), respectively. Urinary colonization was observed in 6/19 (31%) patients with clinical cures at M-3 and 5/14 (36%) patients with clinical cures at M-6. No resistance to cefoxitin was detected. A surgical treatment was required for 7/23 patients (30%). CONCLUSION: Cefoxitin-based antibiotic therapy is suitable for difficult-to-treat ESBL-E infections as prostatitis.
