A total of 747 Shigella isolates were collected from hospitals in Jiangsu Province of China. Susceptibilities to antimicrobials and integrons were tested. A total of 78.3% of S. flexneri isolates and a total of 74.3% S. sonei isolates were resistant to at least three antibiotics. Of the Shigella isolates, 74.7% had integron I and 82.6% had integron II. The conjunction of the high prevalence of integrons in Shigella and high resistance to antimicrobials will lead to rapid dissemination of resistant genes in this region.
