Thioetherhydroxyethylsulfonamide derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923). Results have shown that compounds 8c and 9e display potent activity (MIC = 0.125 microg/mL) against E. coli when compared with the standard drug sulfamethoxazole (SMZ, MIC < 0.5 microg/mL) for this same strain. All the new compounds were fully identified and characterized by NMR ((1)H and (13)C) and X-ray crystallography (for compound 8c). This class of compounds can be considered as a good starting point for the development of new lead molecules in the fight against multi-drug bacterial resistance.
