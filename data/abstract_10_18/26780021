BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of bacteremia in children and is associated with high morbidity. Complete data are lacking on the incidence, related risk factors and mortality associated with this infection. METHODS: Descriptive study including patients younger than 16 years admitted to a tertiary reference hospital, with blood cultures exclusively positive for S. aureus. Four study periods were established: period 1, 1995-1999; period 2, 2000-2002; period 3, 2006-2008 and period 4, 2010-2012. RESULTS: In total, 269 episodes of S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) occurred in 242 patients. Over the total time studied, the incidence increased from 1.3 to 3.3 cases per 1000 patients hospitalized (relative risk: 2.71; 95% confidence interval: 1.85-3.95) and mortality decreased from 18% to 6% (P = 0.008). There were no differences in the resistance patterns of S. aureus strains. The prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) increased from 3% to 13% between periods 1 and 2 and decreased from 14% to 3% between periods 3 and 4 (P = 0.011). The 30-day cumulative mortality was 3.3%, and the SAB-related mortality was 1.5%. Nosocomial acquisition and age 12-16 years were factors independently related with death on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of SAB tripled during the years studied but remained stable in the last period. Antimicrobial resistances did not increase. Although a decrease in mortality was documented, approximately half the 30-day cumulative mortality was caused by SAB.
