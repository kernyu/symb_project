Three Candida tropicalis isolates were obtained from a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The first isolate was susceptible to all drug classes, while isolates 2 and 3, obtained after 8 and 8.5 weeks of caspofungin treatment, respectively, were resistant to the three echinocandins. Multilocus sequence genotyping suggested a clonal relation among all isolates. FKS1 sequencing revealed a stepwise development of a heterozygous and finally a homozygous mutation, leading to S80S/P and S80P amino acid substitutions.
