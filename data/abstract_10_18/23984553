The article considers the results of study of formation and spread of MRSA in patients with suppurative focuses of stafillococus ethiology after application of antibacterial therapy. The antibacterial therapy applied to these patients used one of the following pharmaceuticals--cefazolin, lincomycin, gentamicin, oxampicin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin. All the strains of S. aureus ssp. aureus isolated from patients were tested on MRSA. Their phagovars were detected using international kit of phages for grouping of S. aureus ssp. aureus. The comparison of data received after analysis of resistance to oxacillin of strains and their phages isolated at the onset of disease and after applied treatment was carried out. The study established that against the background of applied antibacterial therapy in 10.7% of patients, MRSA formed and in 15.4% of patients, the change of initial strains of S. aureus ssp. aureus by MRSA strains of other phages groups was established. The presented results testified the need of obligatory testing of strains isolated from patients with staphylococcus infection on antibiotics resistance. The application of antibacterial therapy and its correction taking in account the laboratory data on antibiotics resistance and strict following the sanitary hygienic standards.
