A robust and effective nanocomposite film-glassy carbon modified electrode based on multi-walled carbon nanotubes and a room temperature ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate was prepared by a layer-by-layer self-assembly method. The fabricated modified electrode was used as a novel impedimetric catalase nanobiosensor for the determination of H(2)O(2). Direct electron transfer and electrocatalysis of catalase were fully investigated. The results suggested that catalase could be firmly adsorbed at the modified electrode. A pair of quasi-reversible redox peaks of catalase was observed in a 0.20 M degassed phosphate buffer solution of pH 7.0. The nanocomposite film showed a pronounced increase in direct electron transfer between catalase and the electrode. The immobilized catalase exhibited an excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the reduction of H(2)O(2). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements revealed that the charge transfer resistance decreases significantly after enzymatic reaction with hydrogen peroxide, so that the prepared modified electrode can be used for the detection of ultra traces of H(2)O(2) (5-1700 nM).
