Plants are constantly exposed to numerous biotic or abiotic stress factors throughout their life-cycle. Pathogens and pathogen-derived molecules are the best studied inducers of plant defense responses, but synthetic and naturally occurring molecules have also been used to induce various types of resistance in plants. Here, an oxime molecule, 2-isonitrosoacetophenone (INAP), related to the stress metabolite citaldoxime, was used to trigger metabolic changes in the metabolome of treated Arabidopsis thaliana plants as monitored by UHPLC-MS in conjunction with principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). The chemometric methods revealed metabolites found to be significantly present in response to the treatment. These include bioconversion products (2-keto-2-phenylacetaldoxime-glycoside and l-mandelonitrile-glycoside) as well as those of which the levels are affected by the treatment (benzoic acid and derivatives, other phenylpropanoid-derived compounds and glucosinolates). Using in planta bacterial growth evaluations, INAP treatment was furthermore found to induce an anti-microbial environment in vivo.
