Antimicrobial resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae in France is closely monitored by the pneumococcus surveillance network, founded in 1995, which collects data from regional observatories (Observatoire Regionaux du Pneumocoque [ORP]). In 2007, 23 ORPs analyzed the antibiotic susceptibility of 5,302 isolates of S. pneumoniae recovered in France from cerebrospinal fluid, blood, middle ear fluid, and pleural fluid, as well as from adult respiratory samples. The study showed that 38.2% of the strains were nonsusceptible to penicillin, 19.3% nonsusceptible to amoxicillin, and 10.5% nonsusceptible to cefotaxime. The percentage of pneumococcus nonsusceptible to penicillin varied according to both the sample and the age of the patient (child/adult): blood (27.8%/32.5%), cerebrospinal fluid (33.7%/34.6%), middle ear fluid (60.2%/27.5%), and pleural fluid (50.0%/31.0%). Between 2003 and 2007, the frequency of penicillin resistance in invasive pneumococcal disease gradually decreased from 46.4% to 29.0% in children and from 43.8% to 32.7% in adults. This decrease coincided with the introduction of a seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine into immunization programs and with a general reduction in levels of antibiotic consumption in France.
