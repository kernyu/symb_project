Introduction To combat multi-resistant gram-negative bacteria as the cause of life-threatening infections, antibiotic stewardship activities are of great importance. Objective To detect weaknesses when prescribing antibiotics in hospitals and compare the situation between 2009 and 2014. Methods In 2014, a questionnaire was sent to all 380 physicians employed in 7 hospitals. Primary, secondary and tertiary care hospitals were included. Investigated were: demographic data, position, certified specialization, presence of antibiotic prescription rules and behavior to follow them. 119 completed questionnaires of 2014 were compared to 3 613 obtained in 2009. Results31% of the questionnaires were returned. 53.8% were interns. Half of these had a certified specialization. 32.8% were consultants and 12.6% were chief physicians. 22.6% were internists, 18.4% surgeons, 10.9% urologists and 9.2% anesthetists. The majority prescribed antibiotics on a daily routine, among the interns 66%. 23% of interns reported they would advise colleagues daily and 61% at least once a week. The most common indications for antibiotic use were antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery (35), urinary tract infection (32) and pneumonia (29). Standard duration of antibiotic therapy reported were 7 days for pneumonia, 5 days for urinary tract infections and 1 day for antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery, while almost 50% of surgeons widened the antibiotic prophylaxis to 3, 5, 7,8 and 10 days. 93.3% physicians reported the use of therapeutic guidelines either from their own hospital or from medical societies. Only 59.3% were provided with the antimicrobial resistance data of their hospital. 52.1% would not ask a consultant for advice before prescribing a broadband antibiotic. Compared to 2009, lack of knowledge about antimicrobial resistance, use of guidelines, and advice from a consultant improved about 5%-points each. Conclusion Despite improvement compared to 2009, 38.9% of all physicians asked did not know their regional antibiotic resistant data and half of all surgeons still used surgical prophylaxis longer than 24 h. As the compliance to use guidelines is high with 93.3%, maintenance and development of antibiotic guidelines adjusted to the resistance data is of the greatest importance. Furthermore, antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery longer than 1 day adds to the risks of antibiotics without giving more benefit and must be critically analyzed.
