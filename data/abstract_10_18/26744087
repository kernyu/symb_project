Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae may exhibit in vitro susceptibility to carbapenems, especially those producing weak carbapenemases. Routine clinical laboratories have employed phenotypic tests for screening such isolates. BKC-1 is a recently reported carbapenemase that shows weak carbapenemase activity. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the behavior of distinct phenotypic methods against BKC-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae.
