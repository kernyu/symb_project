One hundred fifty-three Shigella isolates were examined for multiple antibiotic resistance phenotypes and prevalence of class 1 and class 2 integron sequences. The gene cassettes dfrA17-aadA5, dfrA12-orfF-aadA2, and arr-3-aacA4 were found in typical class 1 integrons. The gene cassettes blaOXA-1-aadA1 and dfrA1-sat1-aadA1 were detected in atypical class 1 integrons and in class 2 integrons, respectively. This is the first report of arr-3-aacA4 cassette detected in typical class 1 integrons among Shigella isolates. Rates of antibiotic resistance were different between integron-positive and integron-negative strains (P < 0.05), and all integron-positive isolates were resistant to at least 3 different antimicrobial agents. Typical class 1 integron-positive isolates showed higher resistance rates to cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin than did integron-negative ones (P < 0.05). Typical class 1 integrons and beta-lactamase genes were found in conjugative plasmids, otherwise class 2 and atypical class 1 integrons were located on chromosome. This study demonstrated the wide distribution of class 1 integrons in Shigella spp., which may lead resistance to cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin in China.
