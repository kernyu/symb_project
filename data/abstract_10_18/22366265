PURPOSE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of ciprofloxacin prophylaxis for patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data of 104 patients transplanted at the Department of Hematology Medical University of Lodz between 2005 and 2008 were analyzed. The cohort was divided into two groups depending on the administered ciprofloxacin prophylaxis. Conditioning regimens did not differ significantly among the groups. Multiple myeloma was the main indication for ASCT in both groups. RESULTS: Ciprofloxacin prophylaxis resulted in a statistically significant reduction of duration of intravenous (IV) antibiotic treatment in the group with prophylaxis (p=0.01). The trend has been observed towards lower prevalence of infectious episodes in the prophylaxis group. Positive blood cultures were similar in both groups with no significant resistance to ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that ciprofloxacin prophylaxis is beneficial for patients treated with ASCT following high dose chemotherapy regimen, in terms of the intravenous antibiotics usage. This advantage directly translates into economic benefit and may also induce less bacterial resistance due to less exposure to antibiotics.
