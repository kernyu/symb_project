There is a commonly held perception that Helicobacter pylori related diseases are declining, however these are still associated with a high risk of morbidity and mortality. In recent years worrying themes have emerged such as increasing levels of antibiotic resistance and falling cure rates which illustrate there is no room for complacency with respect to H. pylori. In addition there are many significant issues which have not been elucidated regarding the role played by H. pylori in very serious pathologies such as gastric and esophageal cancer and other more benign disorders common in the developed world such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, functional dyspepsia and perhaps obesity which carry a significant impact both economically and as regards to symptoms. Future guidelines aimed at European practitioners and patients will need to address the questions raised by these issues as well as the more familiar areas such as constituents and duration of therapy.
