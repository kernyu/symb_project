OBJECTIVES: Chronic inflammation of periodontitis aggravates glycemic control in type 2 diabetic patients through aggravation of insulin resistance. Increased or decreased release of various inflammatory mediators, such as high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6 and adipokines, such as adiponectin, leptin, and resistin, are presumed to be responsible for developing and progressing insulin resistance. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of periodontal treatment on glycemic control, serum inflammatory mediators and adipokines in type 2 diabetes patients with periodontitis. METHODS: Twenty-one type 2 diabetic patients with periodontitis received periodontal treatment with topical antibiotics (intervention group) and 8 patients did not receive periodontal treatment (control group). Periodontal examination, including probing pocket depth (PPD) and bleeding on probing (BOP), and blood sampling were performed at baseline, 2 and 6 months after periodontal treatments. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), hs-CRP, TNF-alpha, IL-6, adiponectin, leptin, and resistin were analyzed. RESULTS: In the intervention group, improvements of PPD and BOP, decrease in HbA1c and elevation of serum adiponectin were observed, while in the control group, all parameters were not changed. Generalized linear model revealed that changes of serum adiponectin and TNF-alpha and change of BOP correlated significantly with the reduction of HbA1c at 6 months after periodontal treatments. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that periodontal treatment improves periodontal status and glycemic control with elevation of serum adiponectin in type 2 diabetic patients. The results suggest that HbA1c is reduced by amelioration of insulin resistance due to elevated serum adiponectin after periodontal treatments.
