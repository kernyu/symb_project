A search to identify new mechanisms of isoniazid resistance in Mycobacterium bovis led to the isolation of mutants defective in mycothiol biosynthesis due to mutations in genes coding for the glycosyltransferase (mshA) or the cysteine ligase (mshC). These mutants showed low-level resistance to isoniazid but were highly resistant to ethionamide. This study further illustrates that mutations in mycothiol biosynthesis genes may contribute to isoniazid or ethionamide resistance across mycobacterial species.
