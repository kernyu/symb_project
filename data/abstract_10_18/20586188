In spite of extensive research, no effective vaccine against hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been developed so far. DNA immunization is a potent technique of vaccine design strongly promoting the cellular arm of immune response. The genes encoding nonstructural HCV proteins (NS2-NS5B) are promising candidates for vaccine development. NS5A is a protein involved in viral pathogenesis, in the induction of immune response, and probably in viral resistance to interferon treatment. The objective of this study was to construct a DNA vaccine encoding NS5A protein and evaluate its immunogenicity. A plasmid encoding a full-size NS5A protein was produced using the pcDNA3.1 (+) vector for eukaryotic expression system. The expression of the NS5A gene was confirmed by immunoperoxidase staining of the transfected eukaryotic cells with anti-NS5A monoclonal antibodies. Triple immunization of mice with the plasmid vaccine induced a pronounced cellular immune response against abroad spectrum of NSSA epitopes as assessed by T-cell proliferation andsecretion of antiviral cytokines IFN-gamma and IL-2. In in vitro T-cell stimulation experiments, NS5A-derived antigens were modeled by synthetic peptides, recombinant proteins of various genotypes, and phages carrying exposed NS5A peptides. A novel immunomodulator Immunomax showed high adjuvant activity in DNA immunization. The data obtained indicate that the suggested DNA construct has a strong potential in the development of the gene vaccines against hepatitis C.
