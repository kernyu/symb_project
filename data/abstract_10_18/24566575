Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare neutrophilic dermatosis, often associated with underlying systemic diseases. Treatment usually consists of topics and sometimes systemic immunosuppression. We present the case of a 32-year-old female patient undergoing radiation therapy for extensive recalcitrant pyoderma gangrenosum in which immunosuppressive measures were ineffective to control the disease. Treatment outcome was favourable with only mild side effects in the irradiated areas. Localized radiation therapy hence is a potential effective palliation for refractory cases of pyoderma gangrenosum, or patients unfit to undergo aggressive systemic immunosuppression.
