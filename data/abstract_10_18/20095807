The lymphocyte immunosuppressant sensitivity test (LIST) can predict the pharmacological efficacy of immunosuppressive agents. We herein estimated the mycophenolic acid efficacy using LIST before and 1, 3, and 12 months after the operation in 15 renal transplant recipients. The pharmacological efficacy of mycophenolic acid as assessed before transplantation showed small individual variations, whereas the variability greatly increased at 1 and 3 months after transplantation. Furthermore, the individual IC50 variation among these subjects at 1-year after operation was closely similar to that observed before surgery. No significant implications of these individual differences in the mycophenolic acid sensitivity were noted in regard to the clinical courses of these recipients.
