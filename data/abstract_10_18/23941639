BACKGROUND: Ceftriaxone is frequently administered empirically for hospitalized patients with acute pyelonephritis (APN) due to prevalent quinolone resistance in our hospital; however, its use is inappropriate for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli, an increasing problem. METHODS: A retrospective, 1:2 matched cohort study was performed to evaluate the impact of ESBL on APN treated with empirical ceftriaxone. Each patient in ESBL group was matched with two patients in the non-ESBL group, using a 16-point scoring system, which included age, sex, bacteremia, simplified acute physiology score 2, Charlson comorbidity index and APN severity score. RESULTS: From 2009 to 2011, among 1,322 community-onset cases of the E. coli bacteriuria with 212 (16%) ESBL producers, 261 patients with APN were treated empirically with ceftriaxone in a secondary care hospital. Among these 261 cases, twenty-six patients in the ESBL group and 52 matched patients in the non-ESBL group (1:2) were included. Mean time to defervescence was 4.6+/-2.2 days in the ESBL group and 2.6+/-1.3 days in the non-ESBL group (p<0.01). Rate of microbiological resolution within 5 days after antibiotic treatment was 77% (17/22) in the ESBL group and 100% (45/45) in the non-ESBL group (p=0.01). The duration of hospitalization was 13.3+/-8.2 days in the ESBL group and 7.3+/-3.5 days in the non-ESBL group (p<0.01). No patient died in either group. CONCLUSION: Empirical ceftriaxone therapy for APN caused by ESBL-producing E. coli is inappropriate, and consequently can delay recovery and result in longer hospitalization.
