Formulating and disseminating recommendations for parasite control is a dynamic process that requires constant interaction between parasitology researchers and the end-users in the field. Any set of guidelines requires continuous evaluation of efficacy and possible adverse effects, and adjustments are invariably needed along the way. Experience with formulating guidelines for equine parasite control illustrates that end-users struggle with striking the balance between treating too little and too much.
