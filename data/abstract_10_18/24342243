The beneficial effects of the ethanol extract of Zingiber zerumbet rhizome (EEZZR) for use in the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) were investigated. Syrian golden hamsters were fed a high-fat diet to induce NAFLD. EEZZR (100, 200, or 300mg/kg) were orally administered by gavage once daily for 8weeks. The higher plasma levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, and hepatic lipids, as well as the degree of insulin resistance were lowered by EEZZR. Histological evaluation of liver specimens demonstrated that the hepatic steatosis of EEZZR-treated groups was improved. EEZZR decreased hepatic mRNA levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c and its lipogenic target genes. The hepatic mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, together with its target genes responsible for beta-oxidation of fatty acids were also upregulated by EEZZR. In conclusion, these findings suggest that EEZZR has the promising potential to ameliorate NAFLD.
