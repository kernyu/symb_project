Malaria, caused by several Plasmodium species, is the major life-threatening parasitic infection worldwide. Due to the parasite resistance to quinoline based drugs, the search for antimalarial agents is necessary. Here, we report the structural design, synthesis and antiparasitic evaluation of two novel series of 1,2,4-oxadiazoles in conjugation to N-acylhydrazones, both groups recognized as privileged structures, as well as the studies on the antimalarial activity of 16 previous described analogues. By varying substituents attached to the phenyl ring, it was possible to retain, enhance or increase the antiparasitic activity in comparison to the nonsubstituted derivatives. Replacement of substituted aryl rings by ferrocenyl and cinnamyl moieties attached in the N-acylhydrazone ablated the antiparasitic response, evidencing the structural features associated with the activity. Active compounds exhibited in vitro potency similar to mefloquine, but not all inhibited beta-hematin formation. Additionally, the active compounds displayed low cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells and did not cause hemolysis in uninfected erythrocytes. In Plasmodium berghei-infected mice, the compounds reduced parasitemia but exhibited limited efficacy in increasing mice survival when compared to chloroquine, suggesting that pharmacological improvement is still necessary.
