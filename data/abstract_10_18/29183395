BACKGROUND: Diarrheal diseases are the major infectious disease in developing countries like Nepal. Lack of proper sanitation and antimicrobial resistance gained by microbes have challenged to address diarrheal diseases in resource-limited countries. Early diagnosis of disease and proper antibiotic treatment can significantly reduce the disease burden. This study was designed to determine the recent antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of Vibrio cholerae and Shigella spp. to assure the proper antibiotic treatment. Stool specimens were processed following microbiological protocol and identified by biochemical and serological tests recommended by the Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute. RESULTS: Out of total 640 analyzed stool samples, 50 were culture positive, among them 29 were Shigella spp. (64.4%) and 21 were V. cholerae (46.6%). All V. cholerae strains belonged to the serogroup O1 and serovar Ogawa. Among the Shigella spp., Shigella flexneri 17 (59%) topped the list of serotype followed by Shigella sonnei 8 (28%), Shigella dysenteriae 3 (10%) and Shigella boydii 1 (3%) respectively. All the V. cholerae isolates (100%) were sensitive to cefotaxime while 71% were sensitive to tetracycline but 100 and 90.4% were resistance to co-trimoxazole and nalidixic acid respectively. Shigella isolates were mostly susceptible to cefotaxime (97%) while ciprofloxacin (48%) and ofloxacin (55%) were less effective drugs. CONCLUSIONS: These results on the prevalence of enteropathogens and their antibiotic resistance pattern may help to guide accurate choice of therapy in clinical setting. Hence, development of evidence based National Guidelines for the treatment of diarrhea is needed.
