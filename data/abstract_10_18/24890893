The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) in peripheral T cell subsets of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV1)infected patients, and to analyze the association between the levels of BCRP expression and disease progression in HIV1 infection. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from HIV1infected patients (n=118), including 92 patients with antiretroviral therapy (ART) and 26 patients without a history of ART. Control samples from 30 healthy donors were also analyzed. The expression levels of BCRP in T cells were evaluated by flow cytometry. A high interindividual variability was observed in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the HIV1infected patients and healthy donors; however, the analyzed expression levels of BCRP were significantly higher in the HIV1infected group with ART than those in the group with no history of ART (P<0.01). Furthermore, the frequency of BCRPexpressing T cells was inversely correlated with CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts in HIV1infected patients with ART. The results suggested that BCRP expression varied among HIV1infected patients and healthy donors but was significantly higher in HIV1 patients undergoing ART. In conclusion, the present study suggested that overexpression of BCRP may be involved in disease progression of the HIV1 infection and may participate in drug resistance to ART, thus contributing to the failure of highly active ART in HIV1 therapeutics.
