Burn wounds frequently get infected due to a break in skin integrity and prolonged hospitalization. Microbial flora originating from the patient's own flora colonize and infect the burn wounds. Bacterial biofilms in particular are postulated as the culprit for the development of non-healing burn wounds by inducing chronic inflammation in these patients. In the present study, 190 wound isolates obtained from patients admitted to the burn ward at the Pt. B.D. Sharma PGIMS, Rohtak, were evaluated for biofilm formation along with Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (AST). Biofilm detection was done by modified Tissue Culture Plate method and AST was done by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. A total of 190 isolates were studied, which included Staphylococcus aureus, Coagulase negative Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., Citrobacter spp., Escherichia coli and Enterobacter spp. Of these, 68.9% isolates showed biofilm formation. Biofilm formation was more common in Pseudomonas aeruginosa followed by Klebsiella spp. and Staphylococcus aureus. Biofilm producing isolates showed greater multidrug resistance than non-biofilm producers. In our study, a high rate of biofilm formation and antimicrobial drug resistance was seen.
