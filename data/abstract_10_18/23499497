The rate of the MRSA strains, particularly at burn centers, is increasing worldwide. Detection of mupirocin resistance MRSA strains in the burn centers particularly from personnel will help to control these strains. For this purpose, a total of 116 Staphylococcus aureus isolates from the patients (burns) and personnel (nostrils) in Ahvaz Taleghani hospital (Iran) were investigated. The methicillin and mupirocin resistant isolates were detected by multiplex amplification of the mecA and ileS-2 genes. The mecA was found among 80% of isolates. The rates of mupirocin resistant strains among personnel and patients were 70% and 6%, respectively. The carriage rates of the S. aureus, MRSA and MRSA with high-level mupirocin resistance in the personnel were 40%, 34% and 28%, respectively. In conclusions, the high prevalence of MRSA strains in the patients showed the potential outbreak of the MRSA in the burn center and highlighted the need of antibiotic susceptibility monitoring of MRSA. Moreover being personnel as a main reservoir in terms of MRSA strains with high-level mupirocin resistance emphasizes the screening of the personnel in terms of the MRSA in the healthcare system especially in the burn center.
