Background: Neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors are the recommended antiviral medications for influenza treatment. However, their therapeutic efficacy can be compromised by NA changes that emerge naturally and/or following antiviral treatment. Knowledge of which molecular changes confer drug resistance of influenza A(H7N9) viruses (group 2NA) remains sparse. Methods: Fourteen amino acid substitutions were introduced into the NA of A/Shanghai/2/2013(H7N9). Recombinant N9 (recN9) proteins were expressed in a baculovirus system in insect cells and tested using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention standardized NA inhibition (NI) assay with oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir, and laninamivir. The wild-type N9 crystal structure was determined in complex with oseltamivir, zanamivir, or sialic acid, and structural analysis was performed. Results: All substitutions conferred either reduced or highly reduced inhibition by at least 1 NA inhibitor; half of them caused reduced inhibition or highly reduced inhibition by all NA inhibitors. R292K conferred the highest increase in oseltamivir half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), and E119D conferred the highest zanamivir IC50. Unlike N2 (another group 2NA), H274Y conferred highly reduced inhibition by oseltamivir. Additionally, R152K, a naturally occurring variation at the NA catalytic residue of A(H7N9) viruses, conferred reduced inhibition by laninamivir. Conclusions: The recNA method is a valuable tool for assessing the effect of NA changes on drug susceptibility of emerging influenza viruses.
