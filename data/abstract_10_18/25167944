This review summarizes important studies regarding H.pylori therapy published from April 2013 to April 2014. The main themes that emerge are assessing the efficacy of standard triple therapy, as well as exploring new first-line treatments, predominantly optimized triple therapies and non-bismuth quadruple schemes. Regarding newer non-bismuth quadruple regimens, the compliance and tolerance seem to be similar for sequential and concomitant regimens. Notably, no study yet has demonstrated a clear statistical superiority for either, and a systematic review and meta-analysis may be warranted. Other studies examined the role of levofloxacin and bismuth based therapies in H. pylori eradication. The efficacy of bismuth as a second-line after sequential therapy was particularly noteworthy. Levofloxacin-based therapies also appear to be useful and versatile as part of different antibiotic combinations and in first-, second-, and third-line therapies. The emerging problem of quinolone resistance remains a worry. Individualized therapy, based on factors such as antimicrobial information, resistance data, and CYP2C19 metabolism, may well be the most notable future trend to emerge this year.
