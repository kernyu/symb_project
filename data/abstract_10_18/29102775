OBJECTIVES: This sudy aimed to characterize a blaNDM-1-producing Escherichia coli from a companion dog. METHODS: This strain was isolated from a surveillance study of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria and the specie was identified by API 20E system and MALDI-TOF MS. MICs of various antimicrobial agents were determined by agar dilution. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and various carbapenemase genes including blaNDM, blaIMP, blaVIM, blaSME, blaIMI, blaKPC, blaGES, blaSPM, blaGIM, blaNMC, blaDIM, blaSIM, blaOXA-23, blaOXA-24, blaOXA-48, blaOXA-51 and blaOXA-58 were screened by PCR. S1 nuclease-PFGE and Southern blot as well as a modified random primer walking strategy were performed to analyze the location and the genetic environmen of blaNDM-1 gene. RESULTS: One Escherichia coli isolate belonged to ST167 was found positive for the blaNDM-1 gene and exhibited resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, tetracycline, gentamicin, fosfomycin and ciprofloxacin. blaNDM-1 gene in this strain was located on a approximately 150kb plasmid and the flanking sequences of the blaNDM-1-carrying region (a common gene cluster, DeltaISAba125-blaNDM-1-ble-trpF-DeltadsbC) exhibited 99% identity to the corresponding regions of blaCTX-M-15- harboring plasmids in nosocomial E. coli ST131 isolates.
