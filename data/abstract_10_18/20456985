An improved understanding of the biological pathways deregulated in renal cell carcinoma has led to the development of various targeted agents, changing dramatically the therapeutic options for this disease. However, despite numerous opinions and guidelines, the optimal treatment still remains uncertain. In this review, we analyze the most recent published reports regarding the agents sunitinib, bevacizumab, sorafenib, temsirolimus, and everolimus. Moreover, we assess the novel targeted drugs pazopanib and axitinib. In addition, given the likely lack of cross-resistance between these targeting agents, we discuss sequential and combination targeted therapy in metastatic renal cell carcinoma, analyzing the most recent data.
