Among 3967 Staphylococcus aureus recovered from a Gran Canaria hospital (2003-2010), 28 strains were Panton-Valentine leukocidin-positive community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and were included in this study. Most isolates (89.3%) caused skin and skin-structure infections. Isolates belonging to clonal complex (CC)8 (ST8 and ST931; USA300) prevailed (82.1%). Among these, 5 (21.7%) were resistant to at least 3 antimicrobial classes.
