Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a key transcription factor which is strongly associated with tumor survival, progression, and therapeutic resistance. Accordingly, it has been suggested that the inhibition of the HIF-1 pathway can suppress tumor, and it has become an important therapeutic target. In present study, oltipraz, its metabolite M2, and their derivatives were synthesized and evaluated as HIF-1alpha inhibitors. Among the synthesized, benzyl-substituted pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazine 2g most potently inhibited HIF-1alpha protein accumulation (81% at 10muM) and VEGF, GLUT-1 transcription (77% and 92% at 10muM, respectively).
