BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRPA) is one of the most common agents among health care-associated infections. There is a lack of data on the clinical features of MDRPA from Southern China. METHODS: A case-control surveillance study of P aeruginosa was conducted based on surveillance from July 2008-December 2012, in 5 hospitals of Guangzhou, China. Data were analyzed by univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression using Stata 13 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). RESULTS: Of the 348 P aeruginosa strains, the prevalence of MDRPA was 54%, and it has increased over time. Isolates of P aeruginosa showed increased resistance to most antimicrobials during this time period. Independent risk factors were tracheal intubation insertion (odds ratio [OR], 2.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-4.23; P = .02) and use of carbapenem (odds ratio [OR], 3.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.75-6.47; P < .01). The distribution of MDRPA infections was uneven among the 5 hospitals (P = .01). Being infected with MDRPA strains resulted in longer duration of hospitalization (39 vs 24 days) and higher mortality (49% vs 20%). CONCLUSION: The infections of MDRPA were severe issues. More stringent measures should be applied for those with independent predictors of MDRPA infections because they may induce adverse clinical outcomes.
