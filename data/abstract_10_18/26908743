BACKGROUND: Biofilms affect >80% bacterial infections in human and are usually difficult to eradicate because of their inherent drug resistance. METHODS: We investigated the effectiveness of antimicrobial blue light (aBL) (wavelength, 415 nm) for inactivating Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms in 96-well microplates or infected mouse burn wounds. RESULTS: In vitro, in 96-well microplates, exposure of 24-hour-old and 72-hour-old A. baumannii biofilms to 432 J/cm(2) aBL resulted in inactivation of 3.59 log10 and 3.18 log10 colony-forming units (CFU), respectively. For P. aeruginosa biofilms, similar levels of inactivation-3.02 log10 and 3.12 log10 CFU, respectively-were achieved. In mouse burn wounds infected with 5 x 10(6) CFU ofA. baumannii, approximately 360 J/cm(2) and 540 J/cm(2) aBL was required to inactivate 3 log10 CFU in biofilms when delivered 24 and 48 hours, respectively, after bacterial inoculation. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis revealed the presence of endogenous porphyrins in both A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa TUNEL assay detected no apoptotic cells in aBL-irradiated mouse skin at up to 24 hours after aBL exposure (540 J/cm(2)). CONCLUSIONS: aBL has antimicrobial activity in biofilms ofA. baumannii and P. aeruginosa and is a potential therapeutic approach for biofilm-related infections.
