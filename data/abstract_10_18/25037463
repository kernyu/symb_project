This study assessed the subgingival occurrence of the flagellated, Gram-negative, anaerobic rod Centipeda periodontii in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health/gingivitis with species-specific nucleic acid probes, and evaluated the in vitro resistance of subgingival isolates to therapeutic levels of amoxicillin, metronidazole, and doxycycline. Subgingival plaque biofilm specimens from 307 adults with chronic periodontitis, and 48 adults with periodontal health/localized gingivitis, were evaluated with digoxigenin-labeled, whole-chromosomal, DNA probes to C. periodontii ATCC 35019 possessing a 10(4) cell detection threshold. Fifty-two C. periodontii subgingival culture isolates were assessed on antibiotic-supplemented enriched Brucella blood agar for in vitro resistance to either amoxicillin at 2 microg/ml, metronidazole at 4 microg/ml, or doxycycline at 2 microg/ml. A significantly greater subgingival occurrence of C. periodontii was found in chronic periodontitis subjects as compared to individuals with periodontal health/gingivitis (13.4 vs. 0 %, P < 0.003), although high subgingival counts of the organism (>/= 10(6) cells) were rarely detected (1.3 % of chronic periodontitis subjects). In vitro resistance was not found to amoxicillin or metronidazole, and to doxycycline in only 2 (3.9 %) of the 52 C. periodontii clinical isolates studied. These findings indicate that C. periodontii is not a major constituent of the subgingival microbiome in chronic periodontitis or periodontal health/gingivitis. The potential contribution of C. periodontii to periodontal breakdown in the few chronic periodontitis subjects who yielded high subgingival levels of the organism remains to be delineated. C. periodontii clinical isolates were susceptible in vitro to therapeutic concentrations of three antibiotics frequently used in treatment of human periodontitis.
