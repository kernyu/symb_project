We evaluated 3122 children with E. coli urinary isolates over a 10 year period in order to assess the emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance. Susceptibilities remained stable; however, hospitalized children had a statistically higher risk of developing fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates when compared with outpatients. Stewardship monitoring of fluoroquinolone use amongst hospitalized children is warranted.
