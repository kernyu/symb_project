Oligella urethralis (O. urethralis) is an organism that rarely causes infections in humans. We report the case of a 90-year-old bedridden woman with progressive dementia who was placed in a long-term-care facility. She was admitted to our hospital due to fever and unconsciousness with pyuria. The abdominal computed tomography showed left pneumatosis and urinary stone. Fluoroquinolones-resistant O. urethralis, which was identified by the Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and the 16S rRNA gene sequencing, was isolated form the blood and urine cultures at admission. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of emphysematous pyelonephritis caused by O. urethralis.
