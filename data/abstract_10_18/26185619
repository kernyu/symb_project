BACKGROUND: The Scottish Antimicrobial Prescribing Group (SAPG) was established in 2008 to lead delivery of the national antimicrobial stewardship programme. We performed a national self-reported survey in 2014 to evaluate stewardship activities delivered by regional Antimicrobial Management Teams (AMTs). An on-line survey was developed utilising validated indicators from a published European study along with questions specific to the Scottish context. Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate the responses received. FINDINGS: The survey was completed by 14 of the 15 AMTs (response rate 93 %). Results demonstrated good compliance with 9 of the 10 key European indicators included in the survey; 7 (50 %) of AMTs achieved all 9 indicators and 14 (100 %) of AMTs achieved at least 6 out of 9 indicators (67 %). Progress was also demonstrated across a range of stewardship activities and areas for further work were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The survey results suggest the national stewardship programme in Scotland has reached maturity but consolidation and ongoing development are required. Collaborative working between SAPG and AMTs together with central funding has been key to achieving this level of success.
