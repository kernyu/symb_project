Integration of retroviral elements into the host genome is a phenomena observed among many classes of retroviruses. Much information concerning the integration of retroviral elements has been documented based on in vitro analysis or expression of selectable markers. To identify possible Tf1 integration events within silent regions of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe genome, we focused on performing an in vivo genome-wide analysis of Tf1 integration events from the nonselective phase of the retrotransposition assay. We analyzed 1000 individual colonies streaked from four independent Tf1 transposed patches under nonselection conditions. Our analysis detected a population of G418(S)/neo(+) Tf1 integration events that would have been overlooked during the selective phase of the assay. Further RNA analysis from the G418(S)/neo(+) clones revealed 50% of clones expressing the neo selectable marker. Our data reveals Tf1's ability to insert within silent regions of S. pombe's genome.
