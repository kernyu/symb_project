The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) has the ability to sense a variety of essential nutrients and respond by altering cellular metabolic processes. Hence, this protein kinase complex is poised to influence adaptive changes to nutrient fluctuations toward the maintenance of whole-body metabolic homeostasis. Defects in mTORC1 regulation, arising from either physiological or genetic conditions, are believed to contribute to the metabolic dysfunction underlying a variety of human diseases, including type 2 diabetes. We are just now beginning to gain insights into the complex tissue-specific functions of mTORC1. In this review, we detail the current knowledge of the physiological functions of mTORC1 in controlling systemic metabolism, with a focus on advances obtained through genetic mouse models.
