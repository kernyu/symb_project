INTRODUCTION: There was a follow-up of pregnant women treated for multidrug-resistance tuberculosis (MDR-TB) during pregnancy in Campinas, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil, from 1995 to 2007. METHODS: In a retrospective study, patients with tuberculosis who were resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin and had pregnancy at any time during the treatment were included. The cases were individually treated, considering drug susceptibility test results and patients' prior treatments. RESULTS: Seven cases presented resistance to two or more drugs. Three were already pregnant before the beginning of the treatment, and four conceived after. Two were with AIDS; one died, and the therapeutic program in the other one failed. All showed advanced tuberculosis with acute radiological findings, and the median sputum conversion time for five patients was four months. Two patients were cured. Two newborn babies were infected with HIV by their mothers. CONCLUSIONS: The outcome was unsatisfactory, and direct supervision is imperative in MDR-TB during pregnancy. The family planning program should be strongly recommended.
