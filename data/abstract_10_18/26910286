A 39-year-old male, who received a facial allograft (cytomegalovirus [CMV] donor-seropositive, recipient-seronegative), developed multidrug-resistant CMV infection despite valganciclovir prophylaxis (900 mg/day) 6 months post transplantation. Lower extremity weakness with upper and lower extremity paresthesias developed progressively 11 months post transplantation, coinciding with immune control of CMV. An axonal form of Guillain-Barre syndrome was diagnosed, based on electrophysiological evidence of a generalized, non-length-dependent, sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin led to complete recovery without recurrence after 6 months.
