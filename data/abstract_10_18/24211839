In the present study, Aeromonas isolates from diseased and healthy farmed rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in Mexico, were characterized phenotypically and identified to species level by using 16S rDNA RFLP-PCR. A total of 50 isolates were included in the study and 10 Aeromonas species identified. The species A. veronii biovar sobria (22%), A. hydrophila (20%) and A. bestiarum (20%) were the most predominant. All isolates (100%) were resistant to cephalothin.
