The current study was designed to determine if the NADPH-oxidase NOX2 plays a role in development of obesity after high fat feeding. Wild-type (WT) mice and mice lacking the essential cytosolic NOX2 system component p47(phox) (P47KO mice) were fed AIN-93G diets or high-fat diets (HFD) containing 45% fat and 0.5% cholesterol for 13 wk from weaning. Fat mass was increased to a similar degree by HFD in males of both genotypes (P < 0.05). However, female P47KO-HFD mice had no increase in adiposity or adipocyte size relative to female WT-HFD mice. Resistance to HFD-driven obesity in P47KO females was associated with increased expression of hepatic TFAM and UCP-2 mRNA, markers of mitochondrial number and uncoupling, and increased expression of hepatic mitochondrial respiratory complexes and whole body energy expenditure in response to HFD. Microarray analysis revealed significantly lower expression of mRNA encoding genes linked to energy metabolism, adipocyte differentiation (PPARgamma), and fatty acid uptake (CD36, lipoprotein lipase), in fat pads from female P47KO-HFD mice compared with WT-HFD females. Moreover, differentiation of preadipocytes ex vivo was suppressed more by 17beta-estradiol in cells from P47KO compared with cells from WT females in conjunction with overexpression of mRNA for Pref-1 (P < 0.05). HFD mice of both sexes were resistant to the development of hyperglycemia and hepatic steatosis (P < 0.05) and had reduced serum triglycerides, leptin, and adiponectin relative to WT-HFD mice (P < 0.05). These data suggest that NOX2 is an important regulator of metabolic homeostasis and diet-induced obesity.
