BACKGROUND: Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) has recently emerged as a global public health problem. The objective of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics, management and outcomes of human immunodeficiency virus-negative patients with XDR-TB at a specialist TB hospital in Shanghai, China. METHODS: From July 2007 to June 2009 we analyzed TB patients with culture-proven XDR-TB at a specialist TB hospital in Shanghai. RESULTS: Among 1156 TB cases, all culture-positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, 494 cases (42.7%) were classified as MDR-TB; 126 cases (10.9%) were XDR-TB. At least 3 lung fields were involved in 90.5% of XDR-TB patients and in 80.7% of other MDR-TB patients (p = 0.008). Of the XDR-TB cases, 40.5% were complicated by diabetes and other diseases, significantly higher compared with the other MDR-TB cases (p = 0.002). The rates of resistance to all drugs except isoniazid and rifampicin were significantly higher in patients with XDR-TB than in patients with other MDR-TB (p < 0.001). Treatment failure was more common in patients with XDR-TB than in those with other MDR-TB (p < 0.001), whereas the mortality and default rates did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of XDR-TB is high in some areas of China. The clinical treatment outcome for XDR-TB is usually very poor.
