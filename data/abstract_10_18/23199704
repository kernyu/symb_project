OBJECTIVE: We investigated the efficacy of rifabutin (RFB)-containing regimens for the treatment of RFB-susceptible, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). METHODS: From 146 patients diagnosed with MDR-TB between January 2006 and December 2009 at Asan Medical Center in South Korea, 31 patients (21.2%) were found to have RFB-susceptible MDR-TB. Of these 31 patients, 14 patients who had been treated with RFB for more than one month were included. Forty-two patients with RFB-resistant MDR-TB were selected as a control group, and the outcomes of both groups were retrospectively compared. RESULTS: Of 14 patients with RFB-susceptible MDR-TB, the mean age was 44.4 years and the proportion of extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) was 35.7% (5/14). Baseline characteristics and the drug resistance pattern (except RFB) did not differ between the two groups. Treatment success was achieved in 12 (85.7%) patients in the RFB group: cure in 10 (71.4%) and treatment completion in two (14.3%). The treatment success rate was 52.4% (22/42) in the control group (p = 0.032). Treatment failure was more common in patients of the control group (40.5% vs. 14.3%; p = 0.106). CONCLUSIONS: RFB is useful as an additional drug in the treatment of MDR-TB in patients with RFB-susceptible MDR-TB.
