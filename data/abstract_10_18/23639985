The purpose of this study was to identify the mechanisms leading to carbapenem resistance among multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates recovered from hospitalized patients with nosocomial infections in Mubarak Al Kabeer Hospital, Kuwait. Fourteen carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates were obtained from inpatients in different wards and intensive care units between April 2009 and February 2011. Antibiotic susceptibilities were determined using the E-test method. Genes encoding beta-lactamases were characterized by specific PCR amplification, sequencing and conjugation assays. All isolates were identified as metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) producers using phenotypic and molecular methods. Eleven of the 14 isolates produced VIM-4 (six Klebsiella pneumoniae, three Escherichia coli, one Enterobacter cloacae and one Klebsiella oxytoca). Three K. pneumoniae isolates produced the MBL NDM-1 and co-produced the plasmid-encoded AmpC CMY-4. The VIM-4-producing isolates co-produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases including CTX-M-15 and some SHV derivatives. The VIM-4 gene was not transferable by conjugation studies of six selected strains. We demonstrated here the emergence of VIM-4- and NDM-1-producing isolates in the largest teaching hospital in Kuwait.
