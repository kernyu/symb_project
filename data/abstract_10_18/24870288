Fenton's reagent and sawdust were used on the dewaterability of the raw oily sludge in this study. The result shows that the combination of the two treatment processes is favorable, although the application of Fenton's reagent only is not so good. The capillary suction time (CST) and specific resistance to filtration (SRF) were used to evaluate the effect of dewaterability of the raw oily sludge, and the CST and SRF values are reduced from 1,760 s and 13.8 x 10(12) m/kg to 185 s and 1.5 x 10(12) m/kg, respectively. The dry matter contents of sludge cakes and properties of the supernatant all gained when using only the Fenton's reagent and when using the combined treatment with Fenton's reagent and sawdust respectively were investigated. The results indicate that the oily sludge is more suitable for further treatment after combined process with Fenton's reagent and sawdust.
