OBJECTIVE: Although some studies have reported >90% success with high-dose dual proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-amoxicillin dual therapy for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication, the efficacy of this therapy remains controversial. We aimed to re-evaluate the efficacy and safety of high-dose dual therapy on H. pylori eradication. METHODS: We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and EMBASE for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of high-dose PPI-amoxicillin dual therapy as the rescue therapy on H. pylori eradication. Treatment effect was determined with a fixed-effect model using the inverse variance method and was expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Because of significant statistical heterogeneity (chi(2) 15.98, I(2) = 69%) among the six studies that qualified, four RCTs that included 473 patients with H. pylori infection after eradication failure were assessed. The meta-analysis showed that high-dose dual therapy and guideline-recommended rescue therapies achieved similar efficacy (81.3% vs 81.5%, RR 1.00 [95% CI 0.93-1.08], intention-to-treat analysis), compliance (95.3% vs 95.4%, RR 1.00 [95% CI 0.97-1.03]), and side effects (17.9% vs 19.7%, RR 0.88 [95% CI 0.62-1.25]). CONCLUSIONS: High-dose PPI-amoxicillin dual therapy is comparable to recommended rescue therapies for H. pylori infection. More researches are needed to determine the efficacy of high-dose dual therapy as a first-line therapy.
