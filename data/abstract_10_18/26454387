OBJECTIVE: To assess the in vitro efficacy of doripenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii using Epsilometer strips. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Microbiology, Army Medical College, Rawalpindi and National University of Sciences and Technology, Islamabad, from May 2014 to September 2014. METHODOLOGY: A total of 60 isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa collected from various clinical samples received from Military Hospital were included in the study. The specimens were inoculated onto blood, MacConkey and chocolate agars. The isolates were identified using Gram staining, motility, catalase test, oxidase test and API 20NE (Biomeriux, France). Organisms identified as Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were included in the study. Bacterial suspensions equivalent to 0.5 McFarland turbidity standard of the isolates were prepared and applied on Mueller Hinton agar. Epsilometer strip was placed in the center of the plate and incubated for 18-24 hours. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) was taken to be the point where the epsilon intersected the E-strip. MIC of all the isolates was noted. RESULTS: For Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, MIC(50) was 12 microg/mL and MIC(90) was 32 microg/mL. For Acinetobacter baumannii MIC(50) and MIC(90) was 32 microg/mL. CONCLUSION: Doripenem is no more effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii in our setting.
