The development of novel antimicrobial agents represents a timely research topic. Eighteen salicylanilide 4-(trifluoromethyl)benzoates were evaluated against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. avium and M. kansasii, eight bacterial strains including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and for the inhibition of mycobacterial isocitrate lyase. Some compounds were further screened against drug-resistant M. tuberculosis and for their cytotoxicity. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for all mycobacterial strains were within 0.5-32 mumol/L, with 4-chloro-2-[4-(trifluoromethyl)phenylcarbamoyl]phenyl 4-(trifluoromethyl)benzoate superiority. Gram-positive bacteria including MRSA were inhibited with MICs (3) 0.49 mumol/L, while Gram-negative ones were much less susceptible. Salicylanilide 4-(trifluoromethyl)benzoates showed significant antibacterial properties, for many strains being comparable to standard drugs (isoniazid, benzylpenicillin) with no cross-resistance. All esters showed mild inhibition of mycobacterial isocitrate lyase and four compounds were comparable to 3-nitropropionic acid without a direct correlation between in vitro MICs and enzyme inhibition.
