This study investigated the serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance of 3,820 nasopharyngeal Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from infants and children who presented with respiratory symptoms at Seoul National University Children's Hospital from July 2010 to June 2015 after the introduction of the extended-valency pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs). Serotypes and antimicrobial susceptibility were determined using the Quellung reaction and E-test, respectively. S. pneumoniae was isolated from 397 (10.4%) specimens. The most common serotypes were 19A (14.0%), 23A (12.8%), 15B/C (10.7%), 11A (10.1%), 6C (7.8%), and 6A (6.3%) among the typeable pneumococci (n = 335). The PCV serotype proportions significantly decreased (59.1% in 2010/11 to 17.0% in 2014/15, P < 0.001), whereas the non-PCV serotype proportions significantly increased (40.9% in 2010/11 to 83.0% in 2014/15, P < 0.001). The non-susceptibility rates for penicillin (oral), penicillin (parenteral, non-meningitis), cefotaxime, and erythromycin were 97.8%, 22.8%, 27.7%, and 95.5%, respectively. The proportions of PCV serotypes responsible for non-susceptibility to penicillin (parenteral, non-meningitis) and multidrug resistance significantly decreased (80.8% to 21.1%, P < 0.001 and 64.3% to 12.3%, P < 0.001, respectively), whereas the non-PCV serotype proportions significantly increased (19.2% to 78.9%, P < 0.001 and 35.7% to 87.7%, P < 0.001, respectively). Serotypes 23A and 15B/C demonstrated significant proportional increase among the antibiotics resistant strains. Thus, the PCV serotype proportions decreased and the non-PCV serotype proportions increased among nasopharyngeal carriage pneumococci after the introduction of extended-valency PCVs in Korea. Antimicrobial non-susceptibility rates for penicillin and erythromycin remain high despite the decrease in the proportion of PCV serotypes responsible for antimicrobial resistance over time.
