Leishmania donovani being an intracellular parasite poses many challenges against the attempted chemotherapy. After the resistance towards the first line of antileishmanial drug, Amphotericin B has been the treatment of choice against visceral leishmaniasis, a fatal tropical disease. However, unfavorable toxicity profile, severe side effects, prolonged parenteral administration procedure limits the use of Amphotericin B. Lack of available specific delivery system also makes this drug unsafe for the prolonged use. In this current study, a chitosan-chondroitin sulfate based nanodelivery vehicle has been introduced. Hemoglobin has been attached on the surface of the delivery system for specifically targeting the leishmania infected macrophage taking the advantage of Leishmania being highly auxotrophic for heme. This cheap and biodegradable delivery vehicle has improved the toxicity profile and lowered LD50 value of the drug significantly compared to traditional way of its direct administration.
