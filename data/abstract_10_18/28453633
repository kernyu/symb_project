Objectives: Capnocytophaga spp. are often reported to cause bacteraemia and extra-oral infections and are characterized by their significant contribution to resistance to beta-lactam and macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin antibiotics in the human oral microbiota. The implication of mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) of DNA gyrase A and B ( gyrA and gyrB ) and topoisomerase IV ( parC and parE ) of fluoroquinolone (FQ)-resistant Capnocytophaga spp., hitherto unknown, was explored in this study. Methods: Two reference strains ( Capnocytophaga gingivalis ATCC 33624 and Capnocytophaga sputigena ATCC 33612) and four Capnocytophaga spp. isolated from clinical samples were studied. Nine in vitro FQ-resistant mutants, derived from two reference strains and one FQ-susceptible clinical isolate, were selected by successive inoculations onto medium containing levofloxacin. MICs of ofloxacin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined. The presumed QRDRs of GyrA, GyrB, ParC and ParE from Capnocytophaga spp. were determined by sequence homology to Bacteroides fragilis and Escherichia coli . PCR primers were designed to amplify the presumed QRDR genetic region of Capnocytophaga spp. and sequence analyses were performed using the BLAST program at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Results and conclusions: gyrA mutations leading to a substitution from amino acid position 80 to 86 were systematically detected in Capnocytophaga spp. with ciprofloxacin MIC >1 mg/L and considered as the primary target of FQs. No mutational alteration in the QRDR of gyrB was detected. Other mutations in parC and parE led to spontaneous amino acid substitutions of DNA topoisomerase IV subunit B with no alteration in FQ susceptibility.
