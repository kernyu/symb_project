Helicobacter pylori is a worldwide infection that causes chronic gastritis, duodenal ulcers, and malignancy. Transmission of Helicobacter pylori within a family appears to be the predominant mode of contamination. Recurrence of the infection is frequently seen following treatment.

In this article we will discuss the concepts of inadequate treatment vs. resistant infection and reinfection as causes of persistent H. pylori infection.
