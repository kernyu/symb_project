The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of colistin for 241 multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative pathogens were determined by the Etest and by the broth microdilution method (BMD). The two methods showed essential agreements of 76% (77/102) for Acinetobacter baumannii, 90% (36/40) for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 84% (83/99) for Enterobacteriaceae isolates, with categorical agreements of 100%, 98%, and 100%, respectively. Of the 241 isolates, none showed a very major error and one (0.4%) showed a major error. MICs ranged from 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml for all A. baumannii and most Enterobacteriaceae isolates, and from 1 to 2 mug/ml for most P. aeruginosa isolates. Of the 40 P. aeruginosa isolates, 27 (68%) showed higher colistin MICs by the Etest than by the BMD. In contrast, 77% (78/102) of the A. baumannii and 57% (56/99) of the Enterobacteriaceae isolates showed lower colistin MICs by the Etest than by the BMD. The Etest is a reliable and easy-to-use method to measure colistin MICs of MDR Gram-negative pathogens in clinical laboratories and can be used following validation by microdilution methods.
