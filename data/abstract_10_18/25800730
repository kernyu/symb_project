Bacterial phenotypes are predominantly studied in culture because detection of their specific metabolic pathways in the host is challenging. Development of stable-isotope breath tests, allowing in situ phenotype analyses, may endow diagnostics with new modalities based upon direct monitoring of in vivo microbial metabolism and host-pathogen phenotypic interactions.
