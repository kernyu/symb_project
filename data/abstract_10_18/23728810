Escherichia coli, a commensal bacterium from the intestinal tracts of humans and vertebrate animals, has been used as one of two bacterial indicators of fecal contamination, along with intestinal enterococci, to monitor the microbiological quality of water. However, water environments are now recognized as a secondary habitat where some strains can survive. We investigated the survival of E. coli isolates collected from bodies of water in France exhibiting distinct profiles of contamination, defined according to the following criteria: vicinity of the point sources of contamination, land use, hydrology, and physicochemical characteristics of the receiving water. We selected 88 E. coli strains among a collection of 352 strains to carry out a microcosm experiment in filtered estuarine water for 14 days at 10 degrees C. The relationship between the survival of E. coli strains and genotypic and phenotypic characteristics was analyzed. This work showed that distinct E. coli survival types, able to survive from between 7 and 14 days to less than 2 days, coexisted in the water. E. coli isolates that rapidly lost their culturability were more frequently isolated in water recently contaminated by fecal bacteria of human origin, and most were multiresistant to antibiotics and harbored several virulence factors. In contrast, persistent strains able to survive from 4 to 14 days were more often found in water with low levels of fecal bacteria, belonged mainly to the B1 phylogroup, often harbored only one virulence factor, kspE or ompT, and were able to grow at 7 degrees C.
