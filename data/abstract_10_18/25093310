Antiretroviral therapy to treat HIV, as we know it today, is nothing less than a huge success story in modern medical history. What used to be an almost certain death-sentence was transformed into a very manageable chronic disease by means of highly efficient und mostly well tolerated drugs. Today, HIV-infected patients treated according to international recommendations have a very good chance to outgo the negative effects of HIV-1 and are therefore able to reach an almost normal life expectancy. Furthermore, patients successfully treated with antiretroviral drugs are no longer infectious, which is an essential aspect of global strategies to overcome the pandemic. Nevertheless, due to the complexity of HIV, physicians treating patients with antiretroviral therapy require profound knowledge of aspects such as viral resistance mechanisms and immune reconstitution, as well as drug-toxicity und drug-drug-interactions. Many other aspects such as long-term side-effects of antiretroviral drugs are still unknown. Strict adherence to treatment is of utmost importance.
