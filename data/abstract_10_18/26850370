This study provides a detailed description and characterization of a strain of Aeromonas dhakensis isolated from a diseased juvenile Piaractus mesopotamicus obtained from the fish farm of the National Center for Continental Fish Research and Conservation (CEPTA/ICMBio), in the state of Sao Paul, Brazil. Biochemical tests using the VITEK 2 automated bacterial identification system identified the isolate to genus level; however, further molecular analysis of the 16S rRNA, gyrB and rpoD genes showed that the strain belonged to the species A. dhakensis. As expected, the isolated A. dhakensis strain was resistant to ampicillin and ampicillin/sulbactam, as resistance to ampicillin is a typical characteristic of the genus Aeromonas. Resistance to cefoxitin and meropenem was also observed, but the strain was susceptible to most of the tested antibiotics. The isolated strain of A. dhakensis caused acute haemorrhagic septicaemia in experimentally infected P. mesopotamicus, with a fifty per cent lethal dose of 1.14 x 10(5) CFU/fish. This is the first report of the occurrence of an A. dhakensis strain causing an infection in a fish species of South America, providing important epidemiologic data relating to this important pathogenic species.
