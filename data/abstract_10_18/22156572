BACKGROUND: Antibiotics are used in animal confinement buildings, such as cage-housed (CH) and floor-housed (FH) poultry operations, to lower the likeliness of disease transmission. In FH facilities, antibiotics may also be used at sub-therapeutic levels for growth promotion. Low levels of antibiotic create a selective pressure toward antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in chicken fecal bacteria. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare bacteria and AMR genes in bioaerosols from CH and FH poultry facilities. METHODS: Bioaerosols were collected from 15 CH and 15 FH poultry operations, using stationary area samplers as well as personal sampling devices. Bacteria concentrations were determined by genus- or species-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and AMR genes were detected using endpoint PCR. RESULTS: Enterococcus spp., Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus spp. were significantly higher in bioaerosols of FH poultry operations than CH bioaerosols (P < 0.001) while Clostridium perfringens was significantly higher in area bioaerosols of CH operations than FH area bioaerosols (P < 0.05). Campylobacter spp. were detected only in bioaerosols of FH facilities. Zinc bacitracin resistance gene, bcrR, erythromycin resistance gene, ermA, and tetracycline resistance gene, tetA/C, were more prevalent in bioaerosols of FH facilities than CH bioaerosols (P < 0.01, P < 0.01, and P < 0.05, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Most bacteria are more concentrated and most AMR genes are more prevalent in bioaerosols of FH poultry operations, where growth-promoting antibiotics may be used.
