There is a great deal of evidence to support the use of tetracycline and doxycycline in the treatment of papulopustular rosacea. Nevertheless, these agents have shared and unique adverse effects and relative contraindications. Recently, subantimicrobial-dose doxycycline was demonstrated to be an effective treatment for rosacea, due to its inherent anti-inflammatory properties. Furthermore, subantimicrobial-dose doxycycline has a more preferable tolerability profile and a lower occurrence of bacterial resistance than traditional-dose doxycycline. To further elucidate the role of tetracycline agents in rosacea, clinical trials that compare these agents with each other as well as with other effective rosacea treatments are called for. Adherence studies comparing oral tetracycline treatment with topical metronidazole treatment may also enhance clinical decision making.
