Nosocomial pneumonia is one of the most common infectious diseases acquired in hospital and is often caused by resistant pathogens. For treatment of nosocomial pneumonia an appropriate initial antibiotic therapy is essential and exact knowledge of the specific pathogen spectrum is essential for the correct choice of the empirically calculated antibiotics. In line with a critical reevaluation of the primary treatment, pathogen-specific de-escalation therapy, a diagnosis of possible pulmonary complications (e. g. pleural empyema) and the identification and appropriate rehabilitation measures of non-pulmonary infections are necessary. To attain the best possible outcome the respective therapy concept needs to be adjusted to the individual risk characteristics. Appropriate initial antibiotic therapy, duration of mechanical ventilation and comorbidities are the key factors for patient outcome. This approach helps to avoid the development of resistant pathogens and saves economic resources.
