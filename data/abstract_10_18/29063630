Leclercia adecarboxylata, a Gram-negative bacillus of family Enterobacteriaceae, is an uncommonly identified pathogen isolated from environmental and clinical specimens. Most of the human infections are polymicrobial and commonly occur in immunocompromised hosts, although nosocomial infections in immunocompetent hosts have been documented. Here, we describe the case of isolation of Leclercia species as polymicrobial infection from bovine suffering from respiratory distress in Chhattisgarh state of India. The isolates were identified by their phenotypes, 16S rDNA sequencing and MALDI-TOF-MS. The isolate was found to be resistant to aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolone antibiotics and intermediate resistant to cephalosporins and evidenced for uncertain clinical relevance and could act as hidden source of public health hazard. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Leclercia adecarboxylata is a rarely reported human pathogen. We report here the case from bovine suffering from respiratory distress; the sample yielded Leclercia species as polymicrobial culture. The isolate was found to be multidrug resistant and evidenced for uncertain clinical relevance and could act as hidden source of public health hazard. The limited literature available on this organism is reviewed, and the potential implications of findings are discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of isolation and characterization of multidrug-resistant Leclercia species from animal clinical case from India.
