Bone marrow cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from both acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients contain upregulated levels of cell surface antigen CD33 compared with healthy controls. This difference enables the use of humanized anti-CD33 antibody conjugated to cytotoxic agents for CD33 targeted immunotherapy. However, the expression of the membrane-bound drug transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) has been shown to be critical for resistance against the cytotoxicity of a humanized anti-CD33 antibody conjugated to maytansine-derivative DM4. The aim of the present study was to examine whether the expression of P-gp in AML cell lines is associated with changes in CD33 expression. For this purpose, we established drug resistant variants of SKM-1 and MOLM-13 AML cell lines via the selection of parental cells for resistance to vincristine, mitoxantrone and lenalidomide. All three substances induced a multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype in SKM-1 cells associated with strong upregulation of P-gp and downregulation of CD33. However, in MOLM-13 cells, the upregulation of P-gp and downregulation of CD33 were present only in cells selected for resistance to vincristine and mitoxantrone but not lenalidomide. Inverse expression of P-gp and CD33 were observed in all resistant variants of SKM-1 and MOLM-13 cells. The MDR phenotype of resistant variants of SKM-1 and MOLM-13 cells was associated with alterations in apoptotic regulatory proteins and downregulation of the multidrug resistance associated protein 1 and breast cancer resistance protein.
