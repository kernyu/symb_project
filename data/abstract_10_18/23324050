Cytomegalovirus, regarded as a trigger of several autoimmune diseases, is an opportunistic pathogen. Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) undergoing steroid treatment are susceptible to this infection. In the presence of cytomegalovirus, inflammation becomes more complex. Patients with active UC who are infected with cytomegalovirus are usually non-responders to steroid, while antiviral drugs could induce remission. Cytomegalovirus should be suggested as a probable cause of steroid-refractory UC based on the clinical data in the literatures.
