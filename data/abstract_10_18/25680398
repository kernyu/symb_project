Pseudomonas and Burkholderia pose a significant health threat to people with chronic respiratory conditions; the resistance inherent in these bacteria indicates that new antimicrobial strategies are required. Susceptibility of 56 strains of P. aeruginosa and 55 strains of Burkholderia to manuka honey, tobramycin and colistin using microbroth dilution and E strip was determined. MICs of antibiotics with honey were determined to search for synergistic combinations against two representative strains of each genus. All strains exhibited susceptibility to honey </=10 % (w/v); mean susceptibility of Burkholderia (4.6 % w/v) was lower than P. aeruginosa (7.3 % w/v). Synergistic or additive combinations were found with all four strains tested. Combinations of manuka honey with antibiotics can be used to lower the MIC need to successfully inhibit both P. aeruginosa and B. cepacia. The use of honey as a combination agent may be possible for the management of P. aeruginosa and B. cepacia.
