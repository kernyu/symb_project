Enterococci are opportunistic pathogens, hard to eradicate because of their unusually robust resistance to antibiotics, disinfectants, and desiccation. In recent work, Lebreton et al. (2017) show that traits promoting survival in hospitals were acquired upon adaptation to terrestrial life when Enterococci split from marine ancestors 400 million years ago.
