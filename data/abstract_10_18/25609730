Among 452 samples that were positive by the Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) assay and MGIT 960 system (MGIT), 440 and 10 Mycobacterium tuberculosis samples were detected as rifampin susceptible and rifampin resistant, respectively. Two isolates that were rifampin susceptible by the MGIT system were rifampin resistant by the Xpert assay. rpoB sequencing identified a silent (CTG521TTG) mutation in one isolate and a missense (GAC516TAC) mutation in another. The detection of rifampin resistance is imperfect with both the Xpert assay and MGIT system. Any discordant rifampin resistance results should be confirmed by sequencing of the rpoB gene.
