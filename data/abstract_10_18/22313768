Methylotrophic yeasts, which can utilize methanol as sole carbon and energy source, are exposed to two toxic metabolic intermediates, formaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide, during growth on methanol. Here we report that Msn5p, an importin-beta family nuclear exporter, participated in the formaldehyde resistance mechanism but not in the hydrogen peroxide resistance mechanism in Candida boidinii. Disruption of the MSN5 gene in this yeast caused retardation of growth on formaldehyde-generating growth substrates such as methanol and methylamine, but the expression levels of the methanol-metabolizing enzymes did not fall. The Msn5p-depleted strain was sensitive to formaldehyde but not to hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, a yellow fluorescent protein-tagged Msn5p was diffuse in the cytoplasm of C. boidinii when the cells were treated with high concentrations of formaldehyde or ethanol, but was predominantly associated with the nuclei following treatment with hydrogen peroxide.
