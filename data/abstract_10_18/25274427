Entecavir (ETV) is reported to result in suppression of hepatitis B virus DNA (HBV DNA) replication with minimal drug resistance. However, information on the long-term effect of such therapy on serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) level and elimination of HBsAg is not available. ETV therapy was started in 553 nucleos(t)ide-naive patients with chronic hepatitis B infection (HBeAg positive: 45%) in our hospital. Serum HBsAg levels were measured serially by the Architect assay. The median baseline HBsAg was 2180 IU/mL (0.12-243 000 IU/mL), and median follow-up period was 3.0 years, with 529, 475, 355, 247 and 163 patients followed-up for 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years, respectively. At year 5, the mean log HBsAg decline from baseline was -0.48 log IU/mL, and the cumulative HBsAg clearance rate was 3.5%. Multivariate analysis identified HBV DNA level at baseline (<3.0 log copies IU/mL, odd ratio = 10.2; 95% confidence interval = 1.87-55.5, P = 0.007) and HBsAg level (<500 IU/mL, odd ratio = 29.4; 95% confidence interval = 2.80-333, P = 0.005) as independent predictors of HBsAg seroclearance. These results indicate that although serum HBsAg level declines gradually during ETV therapy, HBsAg seroclearance remains a rare event.
