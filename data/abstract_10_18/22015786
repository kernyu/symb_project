The development of infections in elderly people living in long-term care facilities may have manifold causes. Infections are often treated with an antibiotic which can trigger the selection of multirestistant microorganisms and, therefore, represents an additional risk factor. In Germany as well as in other European countries, only a few prevalence studies on healthcare-associated infections (HCAI) in long-term care facilities have been performed and there is no continuous surveillance established for HCAI and antibiotic treatment. Therefore, the European prevalence study HALT (healthcare-associated infections in long-term care) was initiated to collect data of HCAI, antibiotic use, and the antibiotic resistance of microorganisms in long-term care facilities. From Germany, 73 institutions participated in the HALT project. The overall prevalence for an optional HCAI (at least one symptom) was 1.6 (CI 1.09-2.03) and for HCAI identified by the modified McGeer criteria 0.79 (CI 0.62-1.04). The overall prevalence for antibiotic use was 1.15 (CI 0.73-1.57). In the present paper, the German results of the HALT project are presented.
