The in vitro antifungal susceptibility of a set of 99 clinical isolates of Curvularia was tested against 9 drugs using a reference microdilution method. The isolates had been identified previously to species level by comparing their ITS rDNA and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene sequences with those of reference strains. We were able to reliably identify 73.2% of the isolates, the most frequent species being Curvularia aeria, Curvularia geniculata/Curvularia senegalensis, Curvularia lunata, Curvularia inaequalis, Curvularia verruculosa, and Curvularia borreriae. Most of these isolates had been recovered from nasal sinus, which is generally considered one of the most frequent sites of infection by these fungi. In addition, at least 3 phylogenetic species that have not yet been formally described were detected. The most active drugs were the echinocandins, amphotericin B, and posaconazole, whereas voriconazole and itraconazole showed poor activity.
