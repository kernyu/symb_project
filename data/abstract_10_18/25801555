Vibrio parahaemolyticus is commonly resistant to ampicillin, yet the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not clear. In this study, a novel class A carbenicillin-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase (CARB) family of beta-lactamases, bla(CARB-17), was identified and found to be responsible for the intrinsic penicillin resistance in V. parahaemolyticus. Importantly, bla(CARB-17)-like genes were present in all 293 V. parahaemolyticus genome sequences available in GenBank and detectable in all 91 V. parahaemolyticus food isolates, further confirming the intrinsic nature of this gene.
