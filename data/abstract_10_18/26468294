MageB2 belongs to the melanoma antigen gene (MAGE-I) family of tumor-specific antigens. Expression of this gene has been detected in human tumors of different origins. However, little is known about the protein function and how its expression affects tumor cell phenotypes. In this work, we found that human MageB2 protein promotes tumor cell proliferation in a p53-independent fashion, as observed both in cultured cells and growing tumors in mice. Gene expression analysis showed that MageB2 enhances the activity of E2F transcription factors. Mechanistically, the activation of E2Fs is related to the ability of MageB2 to interact with the E2F inhibitor HDAC1. Cellular distribution of MageB2 protein includes the nucleoli. Nevertheless, ribotoxic drugs rapidly promote its nucleolar exit. We show that MageB2 counteracts E2F inhibition by ribosomal proteins independently of Mdm2 expression. Importantly, MageB2 plays a critical role in impairing cell cycle arrest in response to Actinomycin D. The data presented here support a relevant function for human MageB2 in cancer cells both under cycling and stressed conditions, presenting a distinct functional feature with respect to other characterized MAGE-I proteins.
