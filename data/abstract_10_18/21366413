Salmonella is a human pathogen that causes various types of infections, ranging from mild gastroenteritis to life-threatening typhoid fever. For decades, research on Salmonella has attracted not just clinical microbiologists and epidemiologists but also geneticists and molecular biologists who use Salmonella as a model organism. Hence, meetings dealing with Salmonella can be truly interdisciplinary. Such was the case in the ESCMID-FEMS Conference held in Villars-sur-Ollon (Switzerland) in October 2010. The meeting fostered interactive views of Salmonella biology and prompted the discussion of strategies to prevent and combat Salmonella infections.
