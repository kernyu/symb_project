XDR (extensively drug-resistant) and pre-XDR tuberculosis (TB) seriously compromise prognosis and treatment possibilities, and inevitably require the use of group V drugs (World Health Organization). The progress of all patients with XDR and pre-XDR TB seen in a specialized unit during 2012 and 2013 and treated with regimens that included at least 6 months of meropenem-clavulanate (MPC), capreomycin, moxifloxacin, linezolid, clofazimine, high-dose isoniazid, PAS, and bedaquiline in 1 case, were retrospectively analysed. Ten patients were treated, 9 with an extensive pattern of resistance to at least 6 drugs, and 1 because of adverse reactions and drug interactions leading to a similar situation. Eight of the 10 patients treated achieved bacteriological sputum conversion (2 consecutive negative monthly cultures) over a period of 2-7 months, while 2 died. No adverse reactions attributable to prolonged administration of MPC were observed.
