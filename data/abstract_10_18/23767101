To estimate the ability of cycloferon to influence a microbiological landscape of tonsils surface in often ill children (OIC), the microflora of tonsils before and after a standard course of this preparation in a group of 68 preschool children classified into OIC category. It is established that the microbe landscape of tonsils surface after a course of cycloferon therapy is characterized by reduction of microflora variety, decrease in bacteria titer (including S. aureus), and reduction ion then number of strains resistant to benzylpenicillin, clindamycin, and vancomycin. Thus, it is possible to recommend cycloferon for rehabilitation of OIC.
