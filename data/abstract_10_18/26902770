We determined the complete nucleotide sequence of a self-transmissible IncL/M plasmid, pKOI-34, from a Klebsiella oxytoca isolate. pKOI-34 possessed the core structure of an IncL/M plasmid found in Erwinia amylovora, pEL60, with two mobile elements inserted, a transposon carrying the arsenic resistance operon and a Tn21-like core module (tnp and mer modules) piggybacking blaIMP-34 as a class 1 integron, In808, where blaIMP-34 confers a resistance to carbapenems in K. oxytoca and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
