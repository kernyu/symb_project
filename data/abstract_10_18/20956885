The objectives of this study were to review symptoms, causative agents, antimicrobial sensitivity test, abnormalities of urinary tract and treatment of children with UTI. Fifty cases of childhood UTI, based on urine routine examination and culture, were analyzed and male female ratio was 1:1.3. Sixteen (32%) children were less than one year old. Fever was the most common clinical presentation (82%). Pyuria was detected in 92% of cases. Most common causative organism was Eschericia coli (E. coli) (70%). Susceptibility of E. coli to ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, amikacin and nitrofurantoin was greater than 80% and less susceptible to cotrimoxazole, ampicillin, cephradine and ciprofloxacin.
