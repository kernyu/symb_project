Escalating multidrug resistance and highly evolved virulence mechanisms have aggravated the clinical menace of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. Towards development of economically viable staphylocidal agents here we report eight structurally novel tryptophan-arginine template based peptidomimetics. Out of the designed molecules, three lipopeptidomimetics (S-6, S-7 and S-8) containing 12-amino dodecanoic acid exhibited cell selectivity and good to potent activity against clinically relevant pathogens MRSA, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (MIC: 1.4-22.7 mug/mL). Mechanistically, the active peptidomimetics dissipated membrane potential and caused massive permeabilization on MRSA concomitant with loss of viability. Against stationary phase MRSA under nutrient-depleted conditions, active peptidomimetics S-7 and S-8 achieved > 6 log reduction in viability upon 24 h incubation while both S-7 (at 226 mug/mL) and S-8 (at 28 mug/mL) also destroyed 48 h mature MRSA biofilm causing significant decrease in viability (p < 0.05). Encouragingly, most active peptidomimetic S-8 maintained efficacy against MRSA in presence of serum/plasma while exhibiting no increase in MIC over 17 serial passages at sub-MIC concentrations implying resistance development to be less likely. Therefore, we envisage that the current template warrants further optimization towards the development of cell selective peptidomimetics for the treatment of device associated MRSA infections.
