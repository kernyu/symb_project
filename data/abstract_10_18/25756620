Bioassay-guided fractionation of the organic extracts of a Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain (AP183) led to the discovery of a new macrocyclic polyene antibiotic, bacillusin A (1). Its structure was assigned by interpretation of NMR and MS spectroscopic data as a novel macrodiolide composed of dimeric 4-hydroxy-2-methoxy-6-alkenylbenzoic acid lactones with conjugated pentaene-hexahydroxy polyketide chains. Compound 1 showed potent antibacterial activities against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium with minimum inhibitory concentrations in a range of 0.6 to 1.2 mug/mL. The biosynthetic significance of this unique class of antibiotic compounds is briefly discussed.
