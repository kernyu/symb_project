One of the challenges in clinical infectious diseases is the problem of chronic infections, which can require long durations of antibiotic treatment and often recur. An emerging explanation for the refractoriness of some infections to treatment is the existence of subpopulations of drug tolerant cells. While typically discussed as "persister" cells, it is becoming increasingly clear that there is significant heterogeneity in drug responses within a bacterial population and that multiple mechanisms underlie the emergence of drug tolerant and drug-resistant subpopulations. Many of these parallel mechanisms have been shown to affect drug susceptibility at the level of a whole population. Here we review mechanisms of phenotypic drug tolerance and resistance in bacteria with the goal of providing a framework for understanding the similarities and differences in these cells.
