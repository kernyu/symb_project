Metabolic reprogramming is linked to tumorigenesis, disease progression, clinical outcome and resistance to chemotherapy. However, the significance of glycolytic metabolism in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) remains unclear. Here we report that both NHL patient-samples and cell lines exhibited significant up-regulation of glycolytic metabolism. The glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) inhibited glucose consumption, lactic acid generation and cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest in NHL cell lines under both normoxia and hypoxia, and hypoxia could even enhance the inhibitory effects of 2-DG. Furthermore, 2-DG combined with methylprednisolone synergistically inhibited cell proliferation, induced cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, and thus increased the sensitivity of NHL cells to methylprednisolone via down-regulation of HIF-1alpha and c-MYC. In conclusion, these results present a novel insight into critical roles of glycolytic pathway activation in NHL progression and glucocorticoid resistance. Inhibition of the glycolytic pathway may provide a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of NHL.
