MCR-2 confers resistance to colistin, a `last-line' antibiotic against extensively resistant Gram-negative pathogens. It is a plasmid-encoded phosphoethanolamine transferase that is closely related to MCR-1. To understand the diversity in the MCR family, the 1.12 A resolution crystal structure of the catalytic domain of MCR-2 was determined. Variable amino acids are located distant from both the di-zinc active site and the membrane-proximal face. The exceptionally high resolution will provide an accurate starting model for further mechanistic studies.
