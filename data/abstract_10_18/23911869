Stimulation of P2RX(7) with extracellular ATP potentiates numerous LPS-induced proinflammatory events, including cytokine induction in macrophages, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this process are not well defined. Although P2RX(7) ligation has been proposed to activate several transcription factors, many of the LPS-induced mediators affected by P2RX(7) activation are not induced by P2RX(7) agonists alone, suggesting a complementary role for P2RX(7) in transcriptional regulation. Type I IFN production, whose expression is tightly controlled by multiple transcription factors that form an enhanceosome, is critical for resistance against LPS-containing bacteria. The effect of purinergic receptor signaling on LPS-dependent type I IFN is unknown and would be of great relevance to a diverse array of inflammatory conditions. The present study demonstrates that stimulation of macrophages with P2RX(7) agonists substantially enhances LPS-induced IFN-beta expression, and this enhancement is ablated in macrophages that do not express functional P2RX(7) or when the MAPK MEK1/2 pathways are inhibited. Potentiation of LPS-induced IFN-beta expression following P2RX(7) stimulation is likely transcriptionally regulated, as this enhancement is observed at the IFN-beta promoter level. Furthermore, P2RX(7) stimulation is able to increase the phosphorylation and subsequent IFN-beta promoter occupancy of IRF-3, a transcription factor that is critical for IFN-beta transcription by TLR agonists. This newly discovered role for P2RX(7) in IFN regulation may have implications in antimicrobial defense, which has been linked to P2RX(7) activation in other studies.
