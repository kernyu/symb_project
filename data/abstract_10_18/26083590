BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the most common bacteria causing acute otitis media (AOM). In Japan, a 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was introduced for voluntary vaccination of children in 2010, and it became a recommended vaccination in April 2013. We surveyed the serotypes and antimicrobial susceptibility profile of S. pneumoniae isolates obtained from the middle ear fluid of Japanese children with AOM. METHODS: Between April and September 2013, a total of 176 S. pneumoniae isolates were obtained from the middle ear fluid of children aged 0-3 years with AOM. Isolates were collected from various regions of Japan. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were measured by the broth microdilution method. Serotyping was performed by observing the Quellung reaction. RESULTS: Although 45.5% of the strains were susceptible to penicillin G, 42.6% were penicillin-intermediate strains and 11.9% were penicillin-resistant strains. Serotype 19A (27.3%), serotype 15A (14.2%) and serotype 3 (11.9%) showed a high frequency. Although PCV7 types only accounted for 4.5% of all strains, 44.9% were PCV13 types and 55.1% were non-PCV types. Serotype 15A strains were 100% nonsusceptible to penicillin G and all of these strains showed multidrug resistance. Serotype 15A was frequent in children up to 1 year old. CONCLUSION: After this research was completed, PCV7 was switched to a PCV13 that also contained serotype 3 and serotype 19A. We need to consider the possibility that serotype 15A, which is not included in PCV13, may increase and cause intractable AOM in the future.
