During January to April 2007, hospital staff reported 3 patients with Rhodococcus equi bloodstream infections. Isolates were analyzed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, to confirm identification and to assess strain relatedness; 2 were R. equi but genetically distinct, and 1 was identified as Gordonia polyisoprenivorans. Rapid reference laboratory support prevented an unnecessary outbreak investigation.
