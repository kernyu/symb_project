Systemic fungal infections are an increasingly prevalent health problem, especially among immunocompromised patients. Antifungal drug development lags far behind in comparison to other types of antimicrobial drugs. Current commercially available antifungals are limited by their insufficient potency, side effects, drug-drug interactions, developing drug-resistance, and narrow formulation options. Here, we report the preparation and evaluation of two novel PEG amide conjugates of amphotericin B (AMB (1)): AB1 (4) and AM2 (5). These compounds are nonlabile, they are prepared in only two and three synthetic steps, respectively, and they show antifungal activity against a wide range of clinical fungal isolates. Their toxicity is significantly lower, and their water solubility is up to 5000-fold higher than that of AMB (1). In vivo efficacy studies in a mouse model of systemic candidiasis showed that AM2 (5) successfully cured all the mice at concentrations above 3.5 mg/kg body weight. In conclusion, these properties make AB1 (4) and AM2 (5) promising candidates for clinical use.
