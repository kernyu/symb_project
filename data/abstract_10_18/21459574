Antimicrobial compounds with broad-spectrum activity and minimal potential for antibiotic resistance are urgently needed. Toward this end, we prepared and investigated a novel series of N-chloroheterocycles. Of the compounds examined, the N-chloroamine series were found superior over N-chloroamide series in regards to exhibiting high antimicrobial activity, low cytotoxicity, and long-term aqueous stability.
