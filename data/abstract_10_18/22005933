INTRODUCTION: Catheter-related bloodstream infections very often involve the premature removal of long-term intravascular devices (LTID). The antibiotic lock therapy (ALT) represents a conservative approach to the treatment of uncomplicated infections of tunneled LTID when catheter removal is not a feasible option. CASE REPORT: We present here the first reported case of tunneled LTID bloodstream infection due to a multidrug resistant Lactobacillus rhamnosus. The patient, who had large granular lymphocytic leukemia, was successfully treated with systemic tigecycline therapy and lock therapy. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm ALT as a valid catheter-salvage strategy for the treatment of CRBSIs in clinically stable patients when catheter removal is not a feasible option, tigecycline appear to be a good option.
