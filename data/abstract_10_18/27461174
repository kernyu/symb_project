OBJECTIVE: Type 3 secretion system (T3SS) is the most important virulence factor in Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Of the various T3SS effector genes, exoS and exoU showed mutually exclusive distributions, and these two genes showed varied virulence. In many pseudomonal infections, the distribution of these genes showed different pattern and it influenced severity of infection. This study was aimed to evaluate differences of virulence factors and antibiotics resistance between chronic otitis media and other body infection caused by P. aeruginosa. METHODS: To estimate the prevalence of effector genes of T3SS, especially the distributions of exoS and exoU genes and their association with antibiotic resistance in COM, we compared the prevalence of T3SS genes in isolates from COM with those from lower respiratory infection and bacteremia. Other virulence genes, including groEL, pilA, ndvB, lasB, rhlI, and apr, were also studied to evaluate prevalence. These isolates were tested for antibiotic susceptibility, and we examined the association between antibiotic susceptibility and the prevalence of T3SS effector genes. RESULTS: The COM group showed a significantly higher exoU-positive rate than the control group (70.6% vs. 6.7%; P<0.01). Furthermore, COM patients with exoU showed significant antibiotic resistance to ciprofloxacin and tobramycin (P=0.035), whereas there was no significant difference in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The high incidence of exoU-positive P. aeruginosa and ciprofloxacin resistance can explain the chronicity and intractability of infection in COM. Elucidation of this pathogenicity will facilitate the development of new treatment options for COM patients.
