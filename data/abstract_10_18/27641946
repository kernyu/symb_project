INTRODUCTION: The present study aimed to rank the bond strength to root dentin of a new injectable pozzolan-based root canal sealer, EndoSeal MTA, as compared with MTA Fillapex and AH Plus. METHODS: Eighteen dentinal slices (1 +/- 0.1 mm) were obtained from the middle third of 6 maxillary incisors previously selected. Three canal-like holes with 0.8 mm diameter were drilled perpendicularly on the axial surface of each slice. Then, a standardized irrigation was applied for all holes that were subsequently filled with 1 of 3 test root canal sealers. After that, slices were stored in contact with phosphate-buffered saline solution (pH 7.2) for 7 days at 37 degrees C before the push-out assay. Friedman test and Wilcoxon signed rank test with a Bonferroni correction were used to rank the results. Significance boundary was set at alpha = 5%. RESULTS: Friedman test confirmed a significant dissimilarity in push-out ranks among the tested cements (P < .01). Wilcoxon signed rank test demonstrated AH Plus had significant superior resistance to dislodgment compared with Endo Seal (P < .01) or MTA Fillapex (P < .01), whereas MTA Fillapex presented the lowest push-out values as compared with Endo Seal (P < .01) or AH Plus (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: EndoSeal presents satisfactory bond strength performance for application in endodontic therapy compared with MTA Fillapex, and although it displays a new alternative of injectable bio-tight root canal sealer, it is not able to improve adhesion compared with AH Plus.
