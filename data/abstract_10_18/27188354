OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence of primary HIV-1 drug resistance in newly reported HIV infected individuals receiving no antiviral treatment in Henan. METHODS: Network direct reporting information of newly reported HIV infection cases in six cities of Henan during January to June, 2013 and January to June, 2014 were collected, and blood samples were collected from the cases to conduct genotypic drug resistance test and sequence analysis. RESULTS: Primary HIV-1 drug resistance was detected in 45 of 624 newly reported HIV infection cases, the prevalence of primary HIV-1 drug resistance was 7.21%, which was classified as moderate. Univariate analysis revealed that the prevalence of primary HIV-1 drug resistance was higher in females(chi(2)=11.463, P = 0.001), in age group <20 years(chi(2)=8.969, P=0.011), in illiterates(chi(2)=18.072, P=0.001)and in cases of HIV subtype B infection(chi(2)=9.897, P=0.019). Multi-univariate analysis revealed that the risk of primary HIV-1 drug resistance was high in females(OR=2.194, 95%CI: 1.111-4.331). Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor(NNRTI), Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor(NRTI)and Protease inhibitor(PI)resistance mutations were found in 4.97%, 3.53% and 1.12% of the cases, respectively. M184V/I(2.08%)and K103N/S(2.88%)were the most commonly emerged NRTI and NNRTI resistance mutation. Multiple NRTI resistance mutation was found in four cases. HIV subtype B infections accounted for largest proportion(51.76%, 323/624), followed by CRF07_BC cases(23.72%, 148/624)and CRF01_AE cases(19.71%, 123/624). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of primary HIV-1 drug resistance was moderate in the newly reported HIV infected individuals in Henan. The surveillance for HIV-1 drug resistance transmission should be strengthened and drug resistance test before the antiviral treatment should be given.
