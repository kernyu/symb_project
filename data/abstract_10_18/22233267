Descriptive values were determined for eight antifungal agents within the course of a multi-centre study encompassing 1062 German and Austrian clinical yeast isolates. Candida albicans (54%) was the predominant species isolated followed by Candida glabrata (22%), Candida parapsilosis (6%), Candida tropicalis (5.7%), Candida krusei (4.3%), as well as eleven further candidal and four non-Candida yeast species. While 519 (48.9%) isolates were tested susceptible to all antifungals tested, no isolate was found to exhibit complete cross resistance. For C. albicans, the proportions of susceptible isolates were 93.2% (amphotericin B), 95.6% (flucytosine), 84.3% (fluconazole), 83.8% (posaconazole), 91.8% (voriconazole), 96.5% (anidulafungin), 96.2% (caspofungin) and 97.6% (micafungin). Patterns of complete parallel resistances were observed within azoles (8.8%) and echinocandins (1.7%). While a decreased susceptibility was found infrequently for echinocandins and flucytosine, it was more common for azoles with highest proportions for isolates of C. glabrata (fluconazole, 40.6%; posaconazole, 37.2%), Candida guilliermondii (fluconazole and posaconazole, each 25.0%), C. krusei (posaconazole, 28.3%; voriconazole, 60%), C. parapsilosis (fluconazole, 70.3%) and C. tropicalis (fluconazole, 62.3%). The descriptive values obtained in this study represent a valid basis for the comparison of recent and future epidemiological surveys to analyse the susceptibility of yeast isolates towards major antifungal substances.
