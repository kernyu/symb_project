Concern has been raised about the potential for Clostridium difficile to be a bovine and foodborne pathogen, yet limited study has been performed in cattle, and none in veal calves. This study evaluated the epidemiology and microbiology of C. difficile on one veal farm. Rectal swabs were obtained from calves within 48 h of arrival and at one, 17 and 21 weeks later. Selective culture for C. difficile was performed. Isolates were characterized by PCR ribotyping and PCR for tcdA, tcdB and cdtA. Tetracycline resistance and resistance genes were investigated. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to determine the relationship between shedding of the bacterium and specific ribotypes and the independent variables: time of sampling and area of housing. Calves were twice more likely to test positive 1 week after arrival (51%) when compared to initial results (32%). Shedding at 17 and 21 weeks was significantly lower (2% at both samplings). Ribotype 078 was the most common. Twelve different ribotypes were present initially with only three ribotypes found subsequently. Seventy-six percent (40/53) of isolates initially recovered were tetracycline resistant compared to 93% (81/87) from 2nd sampling. Tetracycline resistance genes were detected in 24% (13/53) of isolates during 1st and in 55% (50/91) during 2nd sampling. The high prevalence of pathogenic C. difficile in veal calves could be of zoonotic concern. The low prevalence before slaughter may be of importance for the evaluation of foodborne risks. Oxytetracycline administration to calves may have an impact on prevalence of C. difficile colonization.
