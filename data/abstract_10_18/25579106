INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of metabolic syndrome, obesity and insulin resistance has become an epidemic. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) affect glucose and lipid metabolism in insulin-sensitive tissues, which in turn reduces the lipid content in the liver by modulating several mediators. TZD as a hypoglycemic agent decrease blood sugar levels. Researchers have also made an attempt to design novel compounds having core structure of TZD with other heterocycles to explore them for anticancer and antimalarial properties. The present review provides an extended study of chemistry and inhibitory activity of established drug candidates containing TZDs, viz. their patenting scenario. AREAS COVERED: In this review, authors have covered TZD-based antidiabetic, anticancer and antimalarial drugs. MEDLINE and PubMed searches, and freedom of information available through FDA, USPTO, EPO and other patent database were used for the preparation of review. EXPERT OPINION: Diabetes management is very important as the number of diabetic patients increased and therefore the present research article will be very much useful for the development of new molecules.
