INTRODUCTION: Recently, Pfaller et al (Drug Resist Update 2010; 13:180-95), have proposed new breakpoints for determining the in vitro susceptibility to fluconazole of Candida albicans, C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis. The aim of this study was to establish the variations in sensitivity of these species applying these breakpoints, in relation to those of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). METHODS: We analyzed 112 strains of Candida: 49 C. albicans, 40 C. parapsilosis and 23 C. tropicalis. Susceptibility to fluconazole was performed by the method Sensititre YeastOne. The breakpoints used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were identified by CLSI and the ones proposed by Pfaller et al. RESULTS: According to the CLSI criteria, all isolates were susceptible to fluconazole. MIC50 and MIC90 were 0.5 mg/L and 2 mg/L for C. albicans and C. parapsilosis, 0.5 mg/L and 1 mg/L for C. tropicalis. With the new criteria, 109 (97%) strains were susceptible. Variations were seen in C. albicans, with 3 strains (6%) susceptible dose-dependent. CONCLUSIONS: When applying the breakpoints recommended by Pfaller et al, and EUCAST, the number of fluconazole-susceptible strains decreased according to the CLSI criteria, especially C. albicans.
