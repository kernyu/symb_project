The aim of this study was to determine the performance of the national "STOP TB" program in central Taiwan during 2003-2007 by examining trends in the combined drug resistance to first-line anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs among clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates. Using 4,819 clinical M. tuberculosis isolates obtained from two mycobacteriology referral laboratories, the resistance to drugs was measured and analyzed along with the treatment outcomes in notified TB patients. The proportion of isolates showing total resistance and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) isolates were 17.7% and 3.67%, respectively. More number of MDR-TB isolates showed high-level resistance to isoniazid (84.18%) and streptomycin (SM) (30.51%); low-level resistance to ethambutol (EMB) (61.58%), SM (41.81%), and pyrazinamide (66.1%); and resistance to ofloxacin (30.4%). However, fewer isolates showed high-level resistance to EMB (19.77%), levofloxacin (17.9%), moxifloxacin (19.6%), kanamycin (8.9%), amikacin (8.9%), and capreomycin (8.9%). Of these MDR-TB isolates, 7.1% were extensively drug-resistant. Trends in combined drug resistance to all the first-line anti-TB drugs and the incidence of MDR-TB were stable during the 2 years (2003-2004) before the implementation of the national "STOP TB" program. After the "STOP TB" program, there were significant declines in the incidence of MDR-TB during 2005-2007 in central Taiwan as well as improved TB-treatment outcomes. Thus, the national "STOP TB" program had a significant positive impact on TB control in central Taiwan.
