Investigation of biological properties of pathogenic bacteria and, first of all, their sensitivity to antibiotics is the key to successful treatment of human opportunistic infections and to selection of appropriate tactics of their prevention. This paper is devoted to the comparative characteristic of modem and classical approaches to determination of sensitivities to antibiotics of conventionally pathogenic bacteria: methods applied in Ukraine and recommendations proposed by European Committee aimed to unify all the methods of testing sensitivity to antimicrobial agents (EUCAST). The major differences of the above-mentioned methods of testing sensitivity of clinical and non-clinical isolates of potentially pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics have been examined in order to confirm the feasibility of usage and permanent updating the EUCAST database and to promote creation of the appropriate unifield national electronic resource.
