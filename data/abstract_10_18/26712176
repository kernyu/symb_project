OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the efficacy of chloroquine as first line agent in treatment of uncomplicated malaria -caused by Plasmodium vivax in children---and to determine its current treatment practice in Pakistan. METHODS: This pilot study was conducted at the Paediatrics Department of Combined Military Hospital (CMH), Lahore, Pakistan. Forty-eight children between six months and twelve years of age having positive blood film for Plasmodium vivax were included. They were treated with chloroquine as a drug of - choice. Efficacy of chloroquine was assessed by clinical response, absence of parasitaemia on day seven and twenty-eight after initiation of therapy. A survey was also conducted to determine the first line therapeutic choice of Paediatricians in the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium vivax malaria in children in Pakistan. RESULTS: The results showed 100% efficacy of chloroquine in treating uncomplicated malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax in children. Artemisin was preferred by 74.28% Paediatricians' in combination therapy as 1st line treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Guidelines proposed by Malaria Control Programme Pakistan (MCPP) in collaboration with World Health Organization (WHO) are comprehensive but not being adhered to. The recently reported resistance of Plasmodium vivax to artemisin should urge measures to implement WHO guidelines.
