During 2011, 160 nasal samples were taken from pigs on 8 different farms in Lithuania. Four methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates were obtained. The isolates were ST398, spa type t011 and SCCmec V and none carried the lukF/lukS genes. Strains were resistant to tetracycline, attributed to tetK and tetM genes, and to erythromycin owing to the ermB gene. One MRSA strain was resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and carried the dfrK gene. This is the first report on the presence and characteristics of livestock-associated MRSA isolated from pigs in Lithuania.
