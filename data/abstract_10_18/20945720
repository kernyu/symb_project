CONTEXT: Influenza is a common and significant respiratory pathogen in primary medical care. Better understanding of influenza epidemiology, clinical characteristics, prevention, and management is essential for effective ambulatory care. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Review of the current literature was performed through PubMed queries and based on the authors' background and experience with influenza. In addition, summary data were presented from existing surveillance of influenza in Wisconsin. RESULTS: Seasonal influenza presents in annual epidemics with significant features of fever and cough. Prevention can be achieved through avoidance, influenza vaccine, and chemoprophylaxis. Diagnoses can be made on clinical grounds when appropriately supported by public health surveillance. Other diagnostic methods have limited use in primary care. Antiviral medications can have significant effects on illness course if started early, but may be limited by resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza is commonly prevented, diagnosed, and treated in the primary care arena. A combined approach to influenza response requires background knowledge on influenza epidemiology, prevention, diagnosis, and management, coupled with up-to-date information based on public health surveillance.
