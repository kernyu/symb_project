A new series of ester analogues of artemisinin 8a-f, incorporating diphenylmethyl as pharmacologically privileged substructure, and 8g-j have been prepared and evaluated for their antimalarial activity against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis in Swiss mice via oral route. These diphenylmethyl-based ester analogues 8a-f were found to be 2-4 folds more active than the antimalarial drugs beta-arteether 4 and artesunic acid 5. Ester 8a, the most active compound of the series, provided complete protection to the infected mice at 24 mg/kg x 4 days as well as 12 mg/kg x 4 days, respectively. In this model beta-arteether provided 100% and 20% protection at 48 mg/kg x 4 days and 24 mg/kg x 4 days, respectively.
