We analyzed the whole-genome sequence of ablaOXA-48-harboringRaoultella ornithinolyticaclinical isolate from a patient in Lebanon. The size of theRaoultella ornithinolyticaCMUL058 genome was 5,622,862 bp, with a G+C content of 55.7%. We deciphered all the molecular mechanisms of antibiotic resistance, and we compared our genome to other availableR. ornithinolyticagenomes in GenBank. The resistome consisted of 9 antibiotic resistance genes, including a plasmidicblaOXA-48gene whose genetic organization is also described.
