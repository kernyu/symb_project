This study was performed to investigate the concordance in terms of molecular characteristics and antimicrobial susceptibility between colonizing and clinical Staphylococcus aureus isolates obtained from children in Korea, where ST72 is the major genotype.This was a prospective observational descriptive study of culture-confirmed S aureus infections obtained from children </=18 years old admitted to Asan Medical Center Children's Hospital in Seoul, Korea, from March 2014 to April 2015. Molecular studies including multilocus sequence typing (MLST), SCCmec typing, polymerase chain reaction amplification of the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) genes, and antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed on S aureus isolates obtained from nares and clinical specimens.During the study period, 126 clinically significant S aureus infections were identified. Nasal swab cultures were made from 113 of the 126 children, and 46.0% (52/113) showed S aureus colonization. The overall concordance between colonizing and clinical isolates by methicillin susceptibility was 94.2% (49/52); all 3 discordant cases were HA-MSSA cases with nasal MRSA. Among the 37 pairs of colonizing and clinical S aureus isolates included in the genotyping analysis, ST72-SCCmec type IV was the most prevalent clone and the PVL genes were positive in 2 patients. Among the 31 pairs of healthcare-associated cases, concordance rates by methicillin susceptibility and sequence type (ST) were 90.3% (28/31) and 84% (26/31), respectively. For the 6 pairs of community-associated (CA) S aureus including 3 CA-MRSA cases, 100% concordance was observed by methicillin susceptibility and ST.The concordance between isolates obtained from children who required medical services was relatively high in Korean children where ST72-SCCmec type IV is the predominant clone as the colonizer and the pathogen. It is suggested that decolonization and continuous care to prevent transmission could be effective in managing and preventing both HA- and CA-SA infections in our setting.
