In an outbreak of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, the outbreak strain had an Asp516Tyr rpoB gene mutation. Phenotypically, low-level rifampicin (RMP) resistance (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] 1-2 mg/l) was observed. Based on drug susceptibility test results, three patients were treated with 12-15 month rifabutin-based regimens and one with a 12-month RMP-based regimen. We retrospectively performed pharmacokinetic calculations to assess the potential for RMP treatment, from which we conclude that MICs for RMP up to 1 mug/ml may be safely overcome by applying 20 mg/kg RMP doses in treatment regimens.
