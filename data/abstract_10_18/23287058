A series of novel 1,2,4-triazole-ciprofloxacin hybrids was designed, synthesised and evaluated in vitro against drug-susceptible and drug-resistant bacteria. A significant part of the compounds obtained showed antibacterial activity higher than the activity of ciprofloxacin, both towards Gram-positive and Gram-negative species. Despite relatively small number of synthesised derivatives, it was possible to observe important dependences between their structure and activity.
