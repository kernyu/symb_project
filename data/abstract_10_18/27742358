Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) is a family of multifunctional enzymes that are involved in detoxification of poisonous compounds. In the present paper, the Leptinotarsa decemlineata genome and transcriptome dataset were mined and 30 GST genes were identified. These GSTs belonged to cytosolic (29 genes) and microsomal (1 gene) classes. Among them 3 GSTs (LdGSTe2, LdGSTs4, and LdGSTo3) possessed splice variants. Of the 29 cytosolic LdGSTs, 3, 10, 5, 4, 4, and 1 members were classified as delta, epsilon, omega, sigma, theta, and zeta subclasses respectively, along with 2 unclassified genes. Phylogenetic analysis suggest that epsilon, omega and sigma subclasses appear to undergo species-specific bloom. Moreover, most epsilon, omega and sigma GSTs are tandemly arranged in three chromosome scaffolds. To find GST candidates involving in insecticide detoxification, we tested the mRNA levels of 20 GST transcripts under stress of cyhalothrin, fipronil or endosulfan. Out of them, LdGSTe2a, LdGSTe2b, LdGSTo5 and LdGSTt1 were significantly overexpressed after exposure to each of the three insecticides. Two other genes were respectively upregulated after cyhalothrin (LdGSTe10 and LdGSTu2) or endosulfan (LdGSTd1 and LdGSTu2) treatment. The diversified expression responses to insecticide exposure suggest that the LdGSTs may depend on a functionally complex system to detoxify different classes of insecticides. In addition, our findings provide a base for a better understanding of the evolution of insecticide resistance, and functional research on specific GST genes.
