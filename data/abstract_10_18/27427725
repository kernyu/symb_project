The functionalization of metallic nanoparticles using antibiotics is a promising nanoplatform to combat bacterial resistance. In the current report, vancomycin was used to functionalize gold nanoparticles (Van-AuNPs) and silver nanoparticles (Van-AgNPs) through a one-step, one-pot process. The process is facile and employs a green synthetic route. Vancomycin was used as a reducing agent to generate Van-AuNPs and Van-AgNPs from gold and silver ions, respectively. Surface plasmon resonance was observed at 520 nm for Van-AuNPs and at 405 nm for Van-AgNPs. Both Van-AuNPs and Van-AgNPs were spherically shaped, with average diameters of 11.01 +/- 3.62 nm and 12.08 +/- 2.13 nm, respectively. Strong diffraction peaks in the X-ray diffraction profiles of both nanoparticles confirmed their face-centered cubic structures. The Van-AgNPs presented higher in vitro antibacterial activity (2.4-4.8-fold increase) than Van-AuNPs against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). These results suggest that AgNPs provide a more effective anti-MRA nanoplatform than AuNPs for vancomvcin functionalization.
