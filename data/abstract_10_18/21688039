A Rice chitinase-3 under enhance version of CaMV 35S was introduced into peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) through Agrobacterium mediation. Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LB4404 was used harboring the binary vector (pB1333-EN4-RCG3) containing the chitinase (chit) and hygromycin resistance (hpt) gene as selectable marker. Putative transgenic shoots were regenerated and grown on MS medium supplemented with 5 mg/l BAP, 1 mg/l kinetin, and 30 mg/l hygromycin. Elongated shoots were examined for the presence of the integrated rice chitinase gene along with hygromycin gene as selectable. The integration pattern of transgene in the nuclear genome of the putative transformed plants (T(0)) was confirmed through Southern hybridization analysis of the genomic DNA. Survival rate of the in vitro regenerated plantlets was over 60% while healthy putatively transgenic (T(0)) plants with over 42% transformation frequency were produced through Agrobacterium mediated gene transfer of the rice chitinase gene and all the plants flowered and set seed normally. T1 plants were tested for resistance against Cercospora arachidicola by infection with the microspores. Transgenic strains exhibited a higher resistance than the control (non-transgenic plants). chitinase gene expression in highly resistant transgenic strains was compared to that of a susceptible control. A good correlation was observed between chitinase activity and fungal pathogen resistance.
