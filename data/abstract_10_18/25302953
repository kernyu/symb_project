The antifungal treatment failures and the emergence of resistant fungal strains have stimulated the need for reproducible and clinically relevant antifungal susceptibility testing (AFST). While the standard reference methods are not intended for routine use, commercial methods are widely used for performing AFST. However, to accelerate AFST and to improve the detection of antifungal resistance, which is the most challenging goal of AFST, novel assays have been developed. Following brief drug exposures of fungal cells, the new antifungal susceptibility end points seem to provide a reliable means of identifying fungal isolates, which harbor mutations that have been associated with antifungal resistance. This article summarizes the recent progress in AFST that is destined to enhance its clinical utility in the near future.
