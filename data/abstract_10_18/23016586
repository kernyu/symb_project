Despite progress in understanding carcinogenesis, cancer is still a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Treatment is complicated by the resistance to chemotherapeutics acquired by tumors, ability to repair damaged DNA, alteration of the interaction between drug and its target, and defects in the machinery that leads to apoptosis. The development of novel therapies based on biologically active peptides, especially antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), and proteins has emerged as a new strategy to defeat cancer.
