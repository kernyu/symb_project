Decreased susceptibility to chlorhexidine gluconate (CHDN) in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is associated with the qacA, qacB, and smr genes, encoding efflux pumps. A total of 334 MRSA isolates were collected from two Canadian intensive care units between 2005 and 2009. We identified the qacAB genes in 7 strains (2%; 2 qacA genes and 5 qacB genes) and the smr gene in 23 (7%) strains. CHDN minimal bactericidal concentrations were slightly higher for strains harboring smr genes.
