It is not clear if patients with heterogeneous intermediate resistance to vancomycin (hVISA) infectious endocarditis (IE) differ from methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) IE patients. All cases of hVISA and MRSA IE diagnosed at the Sheba Medical Centre from 2003 to 2010 were included. Isolates were screened prospectively for hVISA. Medical records were reviewed. The t-test, chi-square test, Fisher exact test and Kaplan Meier analysis were used. Fourteen hVISA IE and 32 MRSA IE were identified. The mean age was 76 years, mean Charlson score was 4.5 and 24% of patients had prosthetic valves. Pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (P/ICDs) were more common in the hVISA group (50% vs. 22%, p 0.05). P/ICDs IE occurred in 29% of hVISA patients vs. 6.3% of MRSA patients (p 0.06). hVISA patients had more positive blood cultures (eight vs. five, p 0.007) and a trend toward longer bacteraemia (15 vs. 7.5 days, p 0.08). Vancomycin minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were similar in the two groups (1.5 mug/mL vs. 1.1 mug/mL, p 0.11). The MIC to daptomycin was higher in hVISA (0.75 mug/mL vs. 0.32 mug/mL, p 0.049). MRSA patients received vancomycin. hVISA patients were switched to other antibiotics. Cardiac surgery and/or P/ICD extraction was performed more commonly in hVISA patients (50% vs. 16%, p 0.027). Mortality was high in both groups (57-66%). The median time to death was 39 days in the hVISA group and 19 days in the MRSA group (p 0.3). hVISA IE is associated with P/ICDs. Both hVISA and MRSA are associated with high mortality. Low rates of surgical intervention and P/ICD extraction reflect the high co-morbidity of patients. Caution should be employed in the empirical use of daptomycin in hVISA patients.
