The nonprotein amino acid beta-aminobutyric acid (BABA) is known to protect plants against various pathogens. The mode of action is relatively diverse and specific in different plant-pathogen systems. To extend the analysis of the mode of action of BABA to plant-parasitic nematodes in monocot plants, we evaluated the effect of BABA against the root-knot nematode (RKN) Meloidogyne graminicola in rice. BABA treatment of rice plants inhibited nematode penetration and resulted in delayed nematode and giant cell development. BABA-induced resistance (BABA-IR) was still functional in mutants or transgenics defective in salicylic acid biosynthesis and response or abscisic acid (ABA) response. Pharmacological inhibition of jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET) biosynthesis indicated that BABA-IR against rice RKN likely occurs independent of JA and ET. However, histochemical and biochemical quantification in combination with quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction data suggest that BABA protects rice against RKN through the activation of basal defense mechanisms of the plant, such as reactive oxygen species accumulation, lignin formation, and callose deposition.
