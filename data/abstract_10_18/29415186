Background: Intra-abdominal abscesses (IAA) are common life threatening complications in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). In addition to interventional drainage and surgical therapy, empirical antibiotic therapy represents a corner stone of treatment but contemporary data on microbial spectra and antimicrobial resistance are scarce. Methods: We recruited 105 patients with CD and IAA from 9 German centers for a prospective registry in order to characterize the microbiological spectrum, resistance profiles, antibiotic therapy and outcome. Results: In 92 of 105 patients microbial investigations of abscess material revealed pathogenic microorganisms. 174 pathogens were isolated with a median of 2 pathogens per culture (range: 1-6). Most frequently isolated pathogens were E. coli (45 patients), Streptococcus spp. (28 patients), Enterococci (27 patients), Candida (13 patients) and anaerobes (12 patients). Resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, penicillins with beta-lactamase inhibitors and quinolones were observed in 51, 36, and 35 patients, respectively. Seven patients had multiple-drug resistant bacteria. 30 patients received inadequate empirical treatment, which was more frequent in patients receiving steroids or immunosuppression (37%) than in patients without immunosuppression (10%: p=0.001) and was associated with a longer hospital stay (21 days vs. 13 days, p=0.003). Conclusion: Based on antimicrobial resistance profiles, we herein report a high rate of inadequate empirical first line therapy for IAA in CD, especially in patients receiving immunosuppression, which is associated with prolonged hospitalization.
