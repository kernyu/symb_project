Schistosomiasis is a disease caused by helminthes of the genus Schistosoma, which threatens approximately 207 million people worldwide. Recently, strains of Schistosoma mansoni appear to be developing tolerance and resistance against Praziquantel, the most commonly available drug on the market used in the treatment of disease. This worrisome development justifies studies that seek alternatives for the prevention, treatment and cure of this disease. This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro activity of new imidazolidine compounds 1-benzyl-4-[(4-chloro-phenyl)-hydrazono]-5-thioxo-imidazolidin-2-one (LPSF/PT-5) and 1-(4-chloro-benzyl)-4-[(4-fluoro-phenyl)-hydrazono]-5-thioxo-imidazolidin-2-one (LPSF/PT-11) against adult worms of S. mansoni. LPSF/PT-5 and LPSF/PT-11 imidazolidine derivatives showed relevant schistosomicidal activity in vitro and induced significant ultrastructural alterations in worms and cell death: results similar to praziquantel. Thus, it is possible that these imidazolidine derivatives can be future candidates as schistosomotic drugs, but further studies are needed to elucidate the induced mechanisms behind this response.
