This study developed and optimized a modular biocathode materials design in bioelectrochemical system (BES) using composite metal and carbon-based materials. The 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) dechlorination could be improved with such composite materials. Results showed that stainless steel basket (SSB) filled with graphite granules (GG) and carbon brush (CB) (SSB/GG/CB) was optimum for dechlorination, followed by SSB/CB and SSB/GG, with rate constant k of 0.0418 +/- 0.0002, 0.0374 +/- 0.0004, and 0.0239 +/- 0.0002 h(-1), respectively. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) demonstrated that the composite materials with metal can benefit the electron transfer and decrease the charge transfer resistance to be 80.4 Omega in BES-SSB/GG/CB, much lower than that in BES-SSB (1674.3 Omega), BES-GG (387.3 Omega), and BES-CB (193.8 Omega). This modular cathode design would be scalable with successive modules for BES scale-up, and may offer useful information to guide the selection and design of BES materials towards dechlorination improvement in wastewater treatment.
