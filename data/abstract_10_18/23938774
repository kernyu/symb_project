Vancomycin exerts its antibacterial activity by binding to d-Ala-d-Ala in bacterial cell wall precursors. Vancomycin resistance in vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) is due to an alternative cell wall biosynthesis pathway in which d-Ala-d-Ala is replaced, most commonly by d-Ala-d-Lac. In this study, we extend our recently developed Marfey's derivatization-based liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay for l-Ala, d-Ala, and d-Ala-d-Ala to d-Ala-d-Lac and apply it to the quantitation of these metabolites in VRE. The first step in this effort was the development of an effective washing method for removing medium components from VRE cells. Mar-d-Ala-d-Lac was well resolved chromatographically from Mar-d-Ala-d-Ala, a prerequisite for MS/MS quantitation of d-Ala-d-Ala and d-Ala-d-Lac. Mar-d-Ala-d-Lac gave similar detection parameters, sensitivity, and linearity as Mar-d-Ala-d-Ala. l-Ala, d-Ala, d-Ala-d-Ala, and d-Ala-d-Lac levels in VRE were then determined in the presence of variable vancomycin levels. Exposure to vancomycin resulted in a dramatic reduction of d-Ala-d-Ala, with a response midpoint at approximately 0.06mug/ml vancomycin and with a broad response profile up to 128mug/ml vancomycin. In contrast, d-Ala-d-Lac was present in the absence of vancomycin, with its level constant up to 128mug/ml vancomycin. This method will be useful for the discovery, characterization, and refinement of new agents targeting vancomycin resistance in VRE.
