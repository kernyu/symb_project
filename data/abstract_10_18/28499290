Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and sequencing-based treponeme typing was used to analyze 72 blood samples, collected from human immunodeficiency virus and syphilis co-infected patients during 2014 to 2015 in Antwerp, Belgium. Twenty-nine (40.3%) isolates were polymerase chain reaction positive for Treponema pallidum, and all tested were macrolide-resistant. Four genotypes were identified by sequencing-based typing including two new genotypes, U4NR8 and SU9R8, whereas enhanced Centers for Disease Control and Prevention typing revealed 7 subtypes.
