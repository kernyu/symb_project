INTRODUCTION: Despite the advanced antibiotic therapies, sepsis continues being a clinical entity with high morbidity and mortality. The ozone/oxygen mixture (O3/O2) has been reported to exhibit positive effects on immunity. The aim of our study was to analyze whether (O3/O2) combined with amoxicillin/clavulanate has any influence on the morbidity and mortality of septic rats. METHODS: We used 48 Sprague-Dawley rats randomly allocated to 6 groups (n=8): healthy (C), septic (I), healthy+ozone therapy (O3), septic+amoxicillin/clavulanate (AMC), septic+amoxicillin/clavulanate+ozone therapy (AMC/O3) and septic+ozone therapy (I/O3). O3/O2 was administered rectally at increasing O3 concentrations during 10 days prior to the onset of sepsis model (intraperitoneally injection of fecal material) or saline administration in healthy control rats. Later (post-inoculation), 3 days per week, O3 was also administered. Vital signs were recorded, and microbiological, hematological and histopathological studies were performed. RESULTS: The number of surviving animal/total was higher in AMC (8/8) than in AMC/O3 (4/8) p=0.077. The percentage of surviving animals with pneumonia was higher in AMC/O3 than in AMC (100% vs 37.5%). In dead animals, AMC/O3 rats had a significantly higher percentage of lesions: Cardiac lesions, pulmonary hemorrhages and pleuritis (100%) and serositis/peritonitis (75%). Only Escherichia coli (2 different biotypes) was isolated from blood and/or peritoneal fluid from all infected groups. A significant decrease in the percentage of band neutrophils from the surviviors belonging to AMC/O3vs AMC was observed (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Rectal pre-treatment with O3/O2 aggravates clinic status in septic rats treated with amoxicillin/clavulanate.
