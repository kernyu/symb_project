A resident plasmid, pBIF10, was isolated from Bifidobacterium longum B200304, and the full-length sequence of pBIF10 was analyzed. In this sequence, we identified at least 17 major open reading frames longer than 200 bp. A tetracycline resistance gene, tetQ, was identified and verified to confer antibiotic resistance to tetracycline. The plasmid replicon with replication protein B gene (repB) and a typical iteron was identified in pBIF10. An artificial clone vector was constructed with the replicon of pBIF10; the results showed that repB controlled plasmid replication in other bifidobacteria host cells at low transformation frequency. Taken together, the analysis and characterization of pBIF10 provided necessary information for the understanding of antibiotic resistance mediated by a plasmid in a Bifidobacterium strain. GC% and repB sequence analyses indicated that pBIF10 was a molecular hybrid of at least 2 other bacterial genera plasmids.
