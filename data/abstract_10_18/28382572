The rate of antibiotic resistance in children continues to rise requiring the use of new antibiotics. Ceftaroline fosamil, a newer-generation cephalosporin, was recently approved for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia in children aged >2 months. Ceftaroline provides coverage against staphylococcal and streptococcal infections, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Pediatric dosing differs from adult dosing, but it maintains a similar pharmacokinetic profile and offers similar efficacy in terms of time above the minimum inhibitory concentration as compared to the adult population. The clinical safety and efficacy of this antibiotic has been assessed in three pediatric clinical trials that led to its approval by the US Food and Drug Administration, and each trial is described within this review. This article will also discuss the ongoing trials assessing the possibility of expanding the indications of this antibiotic to late-onset sepsis, meningitis and osteomyelitis in the pediatric population.
