All Streptococcus pneumoniae strains isolated from paediatric clinical samples at Heraklion University General Hospital in the 10-year period 2000-2009 were tested for serotype and susceptibility to antimicrobials. Among a total of 258 strains, 159 were isolated in the 5-year period 2000-2004, before the introduction of the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7), and 99 in the post-PCV7 5-year period 2005-2009. The prevalence of PCV7-included serotypes decreased in the post-PCV7 period (p = 0.0002), but an increase was observed for serotypes 7F (p = 0.002) and 19A (p = 0.004). Pan-susceptibility rates and susceptibility to cotrimoxazole increased in the post-PCV7 period (p = 0.01 and p = 0.008, respectively), but serotype 19A emerged as a contributor to multi-resistance (p = 0.007). PCV7 was followed by decreased S. pneumoniae resistance and prevalence of vaccine-related serotypes but increased prevalence of serotypes 7F and 19A. Continuing surveillance is required after the recent introduction of PCV10 and PCV13.
