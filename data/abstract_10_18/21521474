We report the first case of cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease treated with AIC246, a novel anti-CMV compound which targets the viral terminase complex and remains active against virus resistant to DNA polymerase inhibitors. A lung transplant recipient developed refractory multidrug-resistant CMV disease involving the lungs, gastrointestinal tract and retina. His disease progressed despite treatment with all DNA polymerase inhibitors; multiple agents reported to have activity against CMV in case series, and reduction in his immunosuppressive medications. AIC246 which is in clinical development was obtained for emergency use, and combined with additional reduction in immunosuppression resulted in rapid clinical, virological and radiological resolution of disease. The patient has remained free of CMV disease or viremia off treatment for greater than 3 months. In summary AIC246, while still in development, may be a promising alternative to current therapies.
