Abstract Results of bacteriological investigations of a gun-shot and a mine-explosion woundings of the extremities were analyzed in Military-Medical Clinical Centres (MMCC) of Kyiv, Lviv and Vinnytsya. Spectrum of the allotted microorganisms and profile of their antibioticoresistance were disclosed. The patterns of resistance were determined in accordance to offering of international experts of European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST). Dominating microflora in a Chief MMCC (Kyiv) and MMCC of a Western Region (Lviv) were various species of the Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa families, while in MMCC of a Central Region (Vinnytsya)--a gramm-negative non-fermentative bacilli of the Acinetobacter genus and Pseudomonas genus. The majority (79.5%) of isolates were characterized by polyresistance for antibiotics. Maximal quantity of strains with a widened spectrum of resistance was revealed in 2 - 3 weeks after a wounding--in 71.4 and 96.9% accordingly.
