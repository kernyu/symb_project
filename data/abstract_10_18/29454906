Treating infections of Gram-negative pathogens, in particular Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is a challenge for clinicians in the Asia-Pacific region due to inherent and acquired resistance to antimicrobials. This systematic review and meta-analysis provides updated information of the risk factors for P. aeruginosa infections in Asia-Pacific, and consequences (e.g., mortality, costs) of initial inappropriate antimicrobial therapy (IIAT). EMBASE and MEDLINE databases were searched for Asia-Pacific studies reporting the consequences of IIAT versus initial appropriate antimicrobial therapy (IAAT) in Gram-negative infections, and risk factors for serious P. aeruginosa infections. A meta-analysis of unadjusted mortality was performed using random-effects model. Twenty-two studies reporting mortality and 13 reporting risk factors were identified. The meta-analysis demonstrated that mortality was significantly lower in patients receiving IAAT versus IIAT, with 67% reduction observed for 28- or 30-day all-cause mortality (OR 0.33; 95% CI 0.20, 0.55; P <0.001). Risk factors for serious P. aeruginosa infection include previous exposure to antimicrobials, mechanical ventilation, and previous hospitalization. The high rates of antimicrobial resistance in Asia-Pacific, as well as increased mortality associated with IIAT and the presence of risk factors for serious infection, highlight the importance of access to newer and appropriate antimicrobials.
