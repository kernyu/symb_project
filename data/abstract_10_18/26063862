Drug resistance to tuberculosis remains a major public health threat. Here, we report two cases of extended-spectrum extensively drug-resistant (XXDR) tuberculosis showing resistance to most first- and second-line agents. The results of a correlation of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and phenotypic testing were discordant, suggesting that overreliance on WGS may miss clinically relevant resistance in extensively drug-resistant disease.
