Antibiotics are one of the most important discoveries in the 20th century and have been widely used for treating animal diseases in the 21st century. However, antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens and widespread concerns regarding their use in animals has received great attention all over the world. Great attention has focused on scientific breakthroughs of the alternatives to antibiotics. Various materials such as enzymes, prebiotics, probiotics, minerals, antimicrobial peptides, acidifiers, plants and plant extracts have been tested as possible antibiotics alternatives. Owing to their effects on intestinal microbiota and immune function, research efforts have been conducted on the application of these feed supplements. This review highlights promising research results about the alternatives to antibiotics in animal husbandry that are expected to beneficially limit the adverse effects of antibiotics and ensure the safety of animal-derived foods and the environment.
