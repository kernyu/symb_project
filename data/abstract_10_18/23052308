We demonstrated that an exogenous conjugate consisting of a beta-lactamase and a monoclonal antibody against a surface antigen of Salmonella is capable of conferring selective penicillin resistance on bacteria. This immunoenzymatic approach allows the rapid growth and detection of specific bacteria and may find other applications when temporary and nongenetic antibiotic resistance is required.
