Preventing, reducing, and controlling the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant organisms is a major public health challenge requiring the participation of the entire medical community and public health agencies. Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) have the potential to integrate the many and sometimes disparate individuals and organizations that rely on antimicrobial agents in an effort to better control antimicrobial prescribing, possibly minimizing the emergence of resistant organisms. Developing and implementing ASPs can be a major challenge for community-based hospitals. In addition to specific and localized patterns of resistance-a consideration for every hospital-community hospitals must develop strategies that appropriately conform to their size, staffing, personnel, and infrastructure. This article reviews the ASP strategies and resources currently available to community hospitals for improving if, when, and how antimicrobial agents are prescribed and delivered.
