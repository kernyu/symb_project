OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the incidence of late-onset sepsis (LOS) in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in Arab states in the Gulf region and to describe the main causative organisms and their antibiotic resistance. METHODS: This observational prospective cohort study was conducted over a 2-year period in five NICUs in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. LOS was defined as the growth of a single potentially pathogenic organism from blood or cerebrospinal fluid in infants >3days of age with clinical and laboratory findings consistent with infection. RESULTS: Seven hundred and eighty-five cases of LOS occurred among 67 474 live births. The overall incidence of LOS was 11.63 (95% confidence interval (CI) 10.84-12.47) per 1000 live births, or 56.14 (95% CI 52.38-60.08) per 1000 admissions. Coagulase-negative staphylococci and Klebsiella spp were the most common organisms, causing 272 (34.65%) and 179 (22.80%) of LOS cases, respectively. No evidence of a seasonal variation in the incidence of Klebsiella spp or in the incidence of all Gram-negative organisms was found. More than half of the Klebsiella spp were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins. CONCLUSION: LOS poses a major burden in this area, which could be due to the increasing care of premature babies. Gram-negative organisms, particularly Klebsiella spp, are having an increasing role in LOS in this region, with high levels of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins. NICUs in the area should create a platform through which to share experience in reducing neonatal sepsis and contribute to a common antibiotic stewardship program.
