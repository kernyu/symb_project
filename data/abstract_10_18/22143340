Aortitis, inflammation of the aortic tissue, is most commonly caused by vasculitic rheumatic conditions, and less frequently infectious organisms. Involvement of the aorta is well defined in HLA-B27-associated spondyloarthropathies such as long-standing ankylosing spondylitis and Reiter's syndrome. However, unlike other spondyloarthropathies, aortic involvement or true aortitis is not a feature of psoriatic arthritis and has been reported in only a few cases. Herein, we report the case of a 22 year-old woman with psoriatic arthritis who developed descending aortitis while using tumor necrosis factor inhibitors.
