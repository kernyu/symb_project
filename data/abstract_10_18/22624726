Transmission of pathogens from donor to recipient is a potential complication of organ transplantation. Herein, we describe the clinical course and outcomes of 4 transplant recipients who received tissues from a donor with multi-organ infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae. Recipient 1 underwent simultaneous liver and kidney transplantation for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and alcohol-related cirrhosis, and acute tubular necrosis, respectively. Soon after transplantation, he developed an infected hematoma and peritonitis due to KPC-producing K. pneumoniae despite receiving tigecycline prophylaxis. He was treated with a prolonged course of tigecycline, amikacin, and meropenem, in conjunction with surgical evacuation and percutaneous drainage of the infected fluid collections. Recipient 2 underwent living-donor liver transplantation for cholangiocarcinoma and primary sclerosing cholangitis using vein graft from the donor infected with KPC-producing K. pneumoniae. Culture of the preservation fluid containing the vein graft was positive for KPC-producing K. pneumoniae. The patient received preemptive amikacin and tigecycline, and he did not develop any infection (as evidenced by negative surveillance blood cultures). The isolates from the donor and Recipients 1 and 2 were indistinguishable by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Recipients 3 and 4 underwent kidney and heart transplantation, respectively; both patients received perioperative tigecycline prophylaxis and did not develop infections due to KPC-producing K. pneumoniae. All transplant recipients had good short-term outcomes. These cases highlight the importance of inter-institutional communication and collaboration to ensure the successful management of recipients of organs from donors infected with multidrug-resistant organisms.
