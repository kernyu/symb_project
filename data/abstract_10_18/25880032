BACKGROUND: All international guidelines recommend perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis (PAB) should be routinely administered to patients undergoing cardiac surgery. However, the duration of PAB is heterogeneous and controversial. METHODS: Between 01.01.2011 and 31.12.2011, 1096 consecutive cardiac surgery patients were assigned to one of two groups receiving PAB with a second-generation cephalosporin for either 56 h (group I) or 32 h (group II). Patients' characteristics, intraoperative data, and the in-hospital follow-up were analysed. Primary endpoint was the incidence of surgical site infection (deep and superficial sternal wound-, and vein harvesting site infection; DSWI/SSWI/VHSI). Secondary endpoints were the incidence of respiratory-, and urinary tract infection, as well as the mortality rate. RESULTS: 615/1096 patients (56,1%) were enrolled (group I: n = 283 versus group II: n = 332). There were no significant differences with regard to patient characteristics, comorbidities, and procedure-related variables. No statistically significant differences were demonstrated concerning primary and secondary endpoints. The incidence of DSWI/SSWI/VHSI were 4/283 (1,4%), 5/283 (1,7%), and 1/283 (0,3%) in group I versus 6/332 (1,8%), 9/332 (2,7%), and 3/332 (0,9%) in group II (p = 0,76/0,59/0,63). In univariate analyses female gender, age, peripheral arterial obstructive disease, operating-time, ICU-duration, transfusion, and respiratory insufficiency were determinants for nosocomial infections (all </= 0,05). Subgroup analyses of these high-risk patients did not show any differences between the two regimes (all >/= 0,05). CONCLUSIONS: Reducing the duration of PAB from 56 h to 32 h in adult cardiac surgery patients was not associated with an increase of nosocomial infection rate, but contributes to reduce antibiotic resistance and health care costs.
