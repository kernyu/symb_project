Phytoalexins are pathogen induced low molecular weight compounds with antimicrobial activities derived from secondary metabolism. Following their identification, phytoalexins were directly incorporated into the network of plant defense responses. Due to their heterogeneity, the metabolic pathways involved in phytoalexin formation and in particular the regulatory mechanisms remained elusive. Consequently, research focus shifted to the characterization of other components of plant immunity such as defense signaling and resistance mechanisms, including components of systemic acquired and induced systemic resistance, effector and pathogen-associated molecular pattern triggered immunity as well as R-gene resistance. Despite the obtained knowledge on these immunity mechanisms, genetic engineering employing these mechanisms and classical breeding reached too low improvements in crop protection, probably because classical breeding focused on yield performance and taste, rather than pathogen resistance. The increasing demand for disease resistant crop species and the aim to reduce pesticide application therefore requires alternative approaches. Recent advances in the understanding of phytoalexin function, biosynthesis and regulation, in combination with novel methods of molecular engineering and advances in instrumental analysis, returned attention to phytoalexins as a potent target for improving crop protection. Based on this, the advantages as well as potential bottlenecks for molecular approaches of modulating inducible phytoalexins to improve crop protection are discussed.
