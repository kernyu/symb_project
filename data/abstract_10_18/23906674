Enterococcus faecalis, a normal compound of the human intestinal microbiome, plays an important role in hospital-acquired infections. Plasmids make a significant contribution to the acquisition of the novel traits such as antimicrobial resistance and virulence by this pathogen. The study investigated the plasmid content and the diversity of plasmid-associated genes in a group of 152 hospital isolates of E. faecalis. The majority of plasmids visualized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of S1 nuclease-digested DNA fell into the range of 50-100 kb. PCR-based screening allowed detection of genes of the rep1(pIP501), rep2(pRE25), rep4(pMBB1), rep6(pS86), rep7(pT181), rep8(pAM373), rep9(pAD1/pTEF2/pCF10), rep10(pIM13) and rep13(pC194) families in 29 different combinations. The par and omega-epsilon-zeta plasmid stabilization systems were ubiquitous (45 isolates, 29.6% and 88 isolates, 57.9%, respectively), while the axe-txe system was not found. The asa1 gene homologues encoding aggregation substance characteristic for the pAD1 and related group of pheromone-responsive plasmids were present in 106 isolates. A variety of sequence variants, including novel ones, of genes associated with pheromone-responsive plasmids, such as rep8(pAM373), rep9(pAD1/pTEF2/pCF10), par, and asa1 were observed. In conclusion, there is a big and only partially characterized pool of diverse plasmids in clinical E. faecalis.
