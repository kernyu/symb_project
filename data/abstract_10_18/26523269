BACKGROUND/AIMS: We compared the efficacies of entecavir (ETV) plus tenofovir (TDF) and ETV plus adefovir (ADV) in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with genotypic resistance to lamivudine (LAM) who showed a suboptimal response to LAM and ADV combination therapy. METHODS: We reviewed 63 CHB patients with genotypic resistance to LAM who showed a suboptimal response to LAM and ADV combination therapy. Among these patients, 30 were treated with ETV + ADV and 33 were treated with ETV + TDF for 12 months. RESULTS: The only baseline characteristic that differed significantly between the two groups was the ETV resistance profile. The rate of a virologic response [serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA level of <20 IU/mL] was significant higher for ETV+TDF than for ETV+ADV over 12 months (57.6% vs. 23.3%, P=0.006, at 6 months; 84.8% vs. 26.7%, P<0.001, at 12 months). The probability of a virologic response was significantly increased in ETV+TDF (P<0.001, OR=54.78, 95% CI=7.15-419.54) and decreased in patients with higher baseline viral loads (P=0.001, OR=0.18, 95% CI=0.07-0.50) in multivariate analysis. No serious adverse event occurred during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CHB who showed a suboptimal response to LAM and ADV combination therapy, ETV+TDF was superior to ETV+ADV in achieving a virologic response regardless of the HBV resistance profile. Further large-scale and long-term follow-up prospective studies are needed to explain these results.
