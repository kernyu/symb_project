Tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a global health emergency. This deadly disease has far-reaching social and economic implications. Diseased individuals need prolonged polypharmacy which is not without ill effects. Treatment compliance is often compromised contributing to rising resistance. HIV co-infection has further worsened the scenario. On the other hand, no new anti-TB drug has hit the market in last 4-5 decades. After a long latency, only the last few years have witnessed growing research in this direction and a widening anti-TB drug clinical pipeline. The compounds in preclinical stage of development have also shown a heartening increase. The present review is an attempt to discuss novel promising patents in this field.
