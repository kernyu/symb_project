OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and microbiological characteristics of women presenting with acute gastroenteritis due to infection with Salmonella spp. or Shigella spp. METHODS: A cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted using data for patients with specimens positive for Shigella spp. and Salmonella spp. attending two major women's hospitals in Porto Alegre, Brazil, between January 2003 and July 2014. Women were included if they had symptoms compatible with bacterial acute diarrhea. Isolates were evaluated to determine antimicrobial susceptibility and patient clinical profile. RESULTS: Among 45 eligible patients, Salmonella spp. was identified in 32 (71%) and Shigella spp. in 13 (29%). The highest antimicrobial sensitivity rates were observed for ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone (n=44, 98% for both) whereas the greatest resistance rate was seen for ampicillin (n=20, 44%). Seven (16%) of the women were pregnant. CONCLUSION: Ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim are suitable choices for the treatment of bacterial acute diarrhea. However, the maternal and fetal safety profile of prescribed medications should be considered when treating pregnant patients.
