This study evaluated the in vitro activity of combinations of doripenem (DRPM) with aminoglycosides (tobramycin or amikacin) or fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin) against 92 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from 16 clinical facilities in 2004 in Japan. We also tested combination effect of other carbapenems (imipenem (IPM), meropenem, biapenem) with aminoglycosides or fluoroquinolone by checkerboard dilution methods. DRPM showed synergistic or additive effects with the aminoglycosides or the fluoroquinolone against 90% of the isolates. The combination of DRPM and aminoglycosides showed the strongest synergistic effects against IPM-intermediate resistant and IPM resistant strains among the tested combinations. These results suggested that combination of DRPM with aminoglycosides would be useful for the treatment of infections caused by P aeruginosa including IPM-resistant strains.
