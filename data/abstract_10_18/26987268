CONTEXT: Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is associated with altering expression of hepatobiliary membrane transporters. Monoammonium glycyrrhizin (MAG) is commonly used for hepatic protection and may have a correlation with the inhibition effect of multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (Mrp2). OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the dynamic protective effect of MAG on rifampicin (RIF)- and isoniazid (INH)-induced hepatotoxicity in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups of 15 rats. Liver injury was induced by co-treatment with RIF (60 mg/kg) and INH (60 mg/kg) by gavage administration; MAG was orally pretreated at the doses of 45 or 90 mg/kg 3 h before RIF and INH. Rats in each group were sacrificed at 7, 14, and 21 d time points after drug administration. RESULTS: Liver function, histopathological analysis, and oxidative stress factors were significantly altered in each group. The expression of Mrp2 was significantly increased 230, 760, and 990% at 7, 14, and 21 time points, respectively, in RIF- and INH-treated rats. Compared with the RIF and INH groups, Mrp2 was reduced and Ntcp was significantly elevated by 180, 140, and 160% in the MAG high-dose group at the three time points, respectively. The immunoreaction intensity of Oatp1a4 was increased 170, 190, and 370% in the MAG low-dose group and 160, 290, and 420% in the MAG high-dose group at the three time points, respectively, compared with the RIF and INH groups. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: These results indicated that MAG has a protective effects against RIF- and INH-induced hepatotoxicity. The underlying mechanism may have correlation with its effect on regulating the expression of hepatobiliary membrane transporters.
