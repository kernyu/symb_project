Clinical failure of Malarone chemoprophylaxis is extremely rare. We report a case of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in a returned traveler to Ghana who fully adhered to atovaquone-proguanil (Malarone) chemoprophylaxis daily dosing, yet took the pills on an empty stomach. Screening of the P. falciparum isolate revealed triple codon mutation of Dhfr at positions 51, 59, and 108. Plasma drug levels of both atovaquone and proguanil revealed sub-therapeutic concentrations.
