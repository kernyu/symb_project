Therapeutic options for unresectable neuroendocrine carcinomas and relapsed or refractory solid tumors are still limited in pediatric patients. We present a retrospective review of 12 children (3 to 16 y) in a case series treated with a novel combination of oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and gemcitabine (triple therapy). We defined its feasibility in a mainly outpatient setting and assessed its toxicity and effectiveness. Three patients with unresectable neuroendocrine carcinomas received triple therapy as first-line treatment; 9 children with relapsed or refractory solid tumors of different entities were assigned after failure of standard treatment protocols. The treatment schedule comprised oxaliplatin (85 mg/m(2)), irinotecan (175 mg/m(2)), and gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m(2)), the latter to be repeated on day 8. A median of 7 cycles was applied. Nine of 12 patients showed hematotoxicity 0-III degrees. Gastrointestinal toxicity I-II degrees were handled satisfactorily by supportive drugs. Tumor response was defined as partial response in 1 of 12 children, stable disease in 8 of 12 children, and progressive disease in 3 of 12 children with a median time of disease control of 7 months. We regard triple therapy as a well-tolerated outpatient treatment option offering children a high quality of life and showing considerable effectiveness in delaying tumor progress.
