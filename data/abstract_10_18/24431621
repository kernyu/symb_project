OBJECTIVES: Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is a common gynecological finding among the women worldwide. Candida species are often less susceptible to antifungal agents. Owing to this fact, in this study, we aimed at assessing the prevalence rate and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of various azoles against Candida species causing VVC in symptomatic women. METHODS: The prospective study included 217 female patients with symptoms of vaginal discharges. Specimens were characterized microscopically and were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing against various azoles according to NCCLSM44 disk-diffusion method. RESULTS: VVC was detected in 18.4 % of the cases. Based on age distribution, the highest rate of Candida infection was observed in the age group of 20-29 years (42.5 %). Antifungal susceptibility revealed that fluconazole was highly effective against Candida Species (97.2 %); on the contrary, the highest resistance was observed in the case of miconazole (63 %). CONCLUSION: In the current study, prevalence rate of VVC was found to be 18.4 %, and among the various azoles tested, fluconazole has the highest antimicrobial activity.
