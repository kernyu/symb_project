OBJECTIVES: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important nosocomial pathogen that can cause a wide range of infections resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Avibactam, a novel non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor, is being developed in combination with ceftazidime and has the potential to be a valuable addition to the treatment options for the infectious diseases practitioner. We compared the frequency of resistance development to ceftazidime/avibactam in three P. aeruginosa strains that carried derepressed ampC alleles. METHODS: The strains were incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of ceftazidime with a fixed concentration (4 mg/L) of avibactam to calculate the frequency of spontaneous resistance. The mutants were characterized by WGS to identify the underlying mechanism of resistance. A representative mutant protein was characterized biochemically. RESULTS: The resistance frequency was very low in all strains. The resistant variants isolated exhibited ceftazidime/avibactam MIC values that ranged from 64 to 256 mg/L. All of the mutants exhibited changes in the chromosomal ampC gene, the majority of which were deletions of various sizes in the Omega-loop region of AmpC. The mutant enzyme that carried the smallest Omega-loop deletion, which formed a part of the avibactam-binding pocket, was characterized biochemically and found to be less effectively inhibited by avibactam as well as exhibiting increased hydrolysis of ceftazidime. CONCLUSIONS: The development of high-level resistance to ceftazidime/avibactam appears to occur at low frequency, but structural modifications in AmpC can occur that impact the ability of avibactam to inhibit the enzyme and thereby protect ceftazidime from hydrolysis.
