Antimicrobial resistance has become one of the most serious public health concerns worldwide. Although circumstances may vary by region or country, it is clear that some Asian countries are epicenters of resistance, having seen rapid increases in the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance of major bacterial pathogens. In these locations, however, the public health infrastructure to combat this problem is very poor. The prevalence rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and multidrug-resistant enteric pathogens are very high due to the recent emergence of extremely drug-resistant gram-negative bacilli in Asia. Because antimicrobial options for these pathogens are extremely limited, infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant bacteria are often associated with inappropriate antimicrobial therapy and poor clinical outcomes. Physicians should be aware of the current epidemiological status of resistance and understand the appropriate use of antimicrobial agents in clinical practice. This review focuses on describing the epidemiology and clinical implications of antimicrobial-resistant bacterial infections in Asian countries.
