BACKGROUND: Resistance of uropathogenic bacteria against the common antibiotics is considerable-especially in the elderly. OBJECTIVES: In Germany nitroxoline is licensed for the treatment of acute urinary tract infections and for prophylaxis of recurrent infections. What is the actual resistance pattern of uropathogenic bacteria? MATERIALS AND METHODS: The in vitro susceptibility of 477 uropathogenic bacteria from patients in 2015 was determined by means of the agar diffusion method. RESULTS: Obviously, this agent is still active against the vast majority of uropathogenic bacteria and in particular against strains of Escherichia coli (E. coli). Pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococci are not really within the spectrum of nitroxoline. One has to keep in mind, however, that even among E. coli and other enterobacteriaceae there are single resistant isolates. This applies in particular to problem strains resistant to many other antibiotics. DISCUSSION: Nitroxoline is a reasonable alternative and a promising option for calculated treatment of urinary tract infections-especially of the elderly, although this drug is not recommended in the current guideline. Laboratory testing of clinical isolates should be requested-at least when treatment fails.
