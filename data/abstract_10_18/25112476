Combinations of glycopeptides and beta-lactams exert synergistic antibacterial activity, but the evolutionary mechanisms driving resistance to both antibiotics remain largely unexplored. By repeated subculturing with increasing vancomycin (VAN) and cefuroxime (CEF) concentrations, we isolated an evolved strain of the model bacterium Bacillus subtilis with reduced susceptibility to both antibiotics. Whole-genome sequencing revealed point mutations in genes encoding the major sigma factor of RNA polymerase (sigA), a cell shape-determining protein (mreB), and the rho termination factor (rho). Genetic-reconstruction experiments demonstrated that the G-to-C substitution at position 336 encoded by sigA (sigA(G336C)), in the domain that recognizes the -35 promoter region, is sufficient to reduce susceptibility to VAN and works cooperatively with the rho(G56C) substitution to increase CEF resistance. Transcriptome analyses revealed that the sigA(G336C) substitution has wide-ranging effects, including elevated expression of the general stress sigma factor (sigma(B)) regulon, which is required for CEF resistance, and decreased expression of the glpTQ genes, which leads to fosfomycin (FOS) resistance. Our findings suggest that mutations in the core transcriptional machinery may facilitate the evolution of resistance to multiple cell wall antibiotics.
