A gold-catalyzed desilylative cyclization was developed for facile synthesis of bridged tetracyclic indolenines, a common motif in many natural indole alkaloids. An antimicrobial screen of the cyclization products identified one compound which selectively potentiates beta-lactam antibiotics in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and re-sensitizes a variety of MRSA strains to beta-lactams.
