BACKGROUND: The antibiotic resistance of nosocomial organisms is rapidly increasing. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of bacterial agents isolated from patients with nosocomial infection. METHODS: This study was performed in the different wards of teaching hospitals of Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences (northern Iran). The study population consists of the patients with the symptoms of nosocomial infection admitted in these hospitals in 2012. The patient data (including age, sex, type of infection, type of isolated organisms and their antibiotic susceptibility) were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: The total number of hospitalizations was 57122 and the number of nosocomial infection was 592. The overall prevalence of nosocomial infection was 1.03% that was mostly in Burn unit and intensive care unit. The most common nosocomial infection was wound infection (44.6%) and the most common organisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter. CONCLUSION: Given the increasing numbers of nosocomial infection in this region, especially infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, it is necessary to make a precise reporting and improve the procedures of infection control in hospitals.
