SETTINGS: Although Pakistan has a high burden of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), little is known about the management and treatment outcomes of MDR-TB patients in Pakistan. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate management and predictors of unsuccessful treatment outcomes among MDR-TB patients. METHODS: In this observational cohort study, 196 MDR-TB patients enrolled at the Programmatic Management Unit for drug-resistant TB of Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar, Pakistan, between 1 January 2012 and 28 February 2013 were included. Patients were followed until an outcome was recorded or 31 January 2015. RESULTS: Extensive concurrent resistance to ofloxacin (OFX) and pyrazinamide (54.6%) was observed. Among 181 patients for whom treatment outcome was available, 135 (74.6%) were cured, 1 (0.6%) completed treatment, 35 (19.3%) died, 8 (4.4%) failed treatment and 2 (1.1%) defaulted. In multivariate analysis, predictors of unsuccessful treatment outcome (death, failure and default) were age >40 years (OR 3.412, P = 0.009), baseline body weight <40 kg (OR 2.966, P = 0.020), concurrent comorbidity (OR 3.785, P = 0.023), resistance to OFX (OR 2.777, P = 0.023), lung cavitations at baseline chest X-ray (OR 5.253, P < 0.001) and regimen modification due to adverse events (OR 3.492, P = 0.037). CONCLUSION: The treatment outcome results were encouraging. Patients with identifiable predictors of poor treatment outcome should receive enhanced clinical management. Early detection and management of mild adverse effects can help prevent regimen modification and may improve treatment outcomes.
