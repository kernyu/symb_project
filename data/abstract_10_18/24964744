BACKGROUND: The epidermal growth factor receptor family is expressed in breast cancer, and agents targeting this pathway have single agent effects (e.g. traztuzumab). Development of resistance may be due to the presence of alternative pathways, particularly activation of the PI3K/Akt/MTOR pathway. We have therefore examined the effect of inhibitors of this pathway (ZSTK474 and sirolimus) in combination with the epidermal growth factor (EGFR) inhibitors erlotinib and gefitinib in breast MCF10a isogenic cell lines with EGFR, BRAF, AKT, and PI3K mutations. RESULTS: PI3K mutation conferred increased activity of EGFR inhibitors against MCF10a cells in comparison with the parental cell line and other mutations studied. Combination of EGFR inhibitors with either the PI3K inhibitor ZSTK474 or the MTOR inhibitor sirolimus showed increased activity. CONCLUSIONS: These results are encouraging for the use of combinations targeting the PI3K and EGFR pathway simultaneously.
