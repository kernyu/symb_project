We tested 868 urinary isolates of Escherichia coli collected from 2010 to 2013 as part of the Canadian national surveillance study CANWARD against fosfomycin by using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) agar dilution method with MIC interpretation in accordance with the CLSI M100-S23 (2013) criteria. The concentrations of fosfomycin inhibiting 50 and 90% of the isolates were </=1 and 4 mug/ml; 99.4% of the isolates were susceptible to fosfomycin.
