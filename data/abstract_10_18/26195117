INTRODUCTION: Tuberculosis-related morbidity and mortality remain important. Emergence and diffusion of multidrug-resistance tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a global public health concern. Cases of MDR-TB in children are a sentinel event indicating the spread of a mycobacterial strain within a community. Latent TB precedes MDR-TB and screening and follow-up of contact individuals are key points of TB infection control. METHODS: We performed the case-investigation of 20 adult cases of MDR-TB managed in our institution. RESULTS: Forty-six pediatric contact individuals were identified. A high proportion of these children were lost to follow-up (80% at 12 months), showing that monitoring this reservoir population with migrant history is challenging. Five (11%) children presented a secondary infection: one child was diagnosed with active TB infection (positive tuberculin skin test associated with abnormalities on chest computer tomography [CT] scan). Four children were diagnosed with latent TB infection (isolated positive tuberculin skin test with normal CT scan). Two of these children received a treatment adjusted to the strain of the index case. DISCUSSION: In the setting of emerging MDR-TB, tuberculin skin test may be likely replaced by specific interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA), independent of prior BCG vaccination. In addition, chest CT scan is preferred to chest X-ray to detect TB lesions. The management of latent TB infection is controversial: immediate treatment with second-line anti-TB drugs adapted to the index case strain or, consistently with WHO guidelines, a simple follow-up with subsequent treatment in case of active TB.
