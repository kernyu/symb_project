OBJECTIVES: To determine macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) resistance determinants in the Capnocytophaga genus and to describe the prevalence of beta-lactam resistance genes in human oral Capnocytophaga species. METHODS: Forty-eight Capnocytophaga isolates identified by analysis of 16S rRNA sequences were isolated from subgingival samples from 14 haematology patients (HPs), 11 periodontitis patients (PPs) and 17 healthy volunteers (HVs). MICs of beta-lactam and MLS antibiotics were obtained for all isolates. blaCfxA, blaCSP-1 (encoding a new class A beta-lactamase) and MLS resistance genes [erm(F), erm(B), erm(Q), erm(D), erm(C) and erm(A)] were evaluated using specific PCR and sequencing. RESULTS: In HVs, which had the lowest prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing isolates in comparison with the other groups (16%; P < 0.001), Capnocytophaga ochracea was the prominent species (68%; P < 0.03). In PPs, which had a high prevalence of beta-lactamase-positive isolates (82%; P < 0.001), Capnocytophaga sputigena was more frequently identified (64%; P < 0.03). In HPs, 50% of isolates were beta-lactamase-positive. The more rarely identified species (15%) Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Capnocytophaga granulosa and Capnocytophaga leadbetteri were isolated only from PPs and/or HPs. All beta-lactam-resistant isolates (44%) were PCR-positive for blaCfxA (31%) or blaCSP-1 (12.5%). Interestingly, blaCSP-1 was identified only in a subgroup of the C. sputigena species. Twenty-nine percent of isolates were MLS resistant independently of species identification, beta-lactamase production or patient group. The MLS-resistant isolates carried the erm(F) or erm(C) gene (93% and 7%, respectively), previously unknown in the Capnocytophaga genus. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings illustrate that Capnocytophaga species are important contributors to the beta-lactam and MLS resistance gene reservoir in the oral microbiome.
