Considering the medical, biotechnological, and economical importance of actinobacteria, there is a continuous need to improve the tools for genetic engineering of a broad range of these microorganisms. Intergeneric conjugation has proven to be a valuable yet imperfect tool for this purpose. The natural resistance of many actinomycetes to nalidixic acid (Nal) is generally exploited to eliminate the sensitive Escherichia coli donor strain following conjugation. Nevertheless, Nal can delay growth and have other unexpected effects on the recipient strain. To provide an improved alternative to antibiotics, we propose a postconjugational counterselection using a diaminopimelic acid (DAP) auxotrophic donor strain. The DAP-negative phenotype was obtained by introducing a dapA deletion into the popular methylase-negative donor strain E. coli ET12567/pUZ8002. The viability of ET12567 and its DeltadapA mutant exposed to DAP deprivation or Nal selection were compared in liquid pure culture and after mating with Streptomyces coelicolor. Results showed that death of the E. coli DeltadapA Nal-sensitive donor strain occurred more efficiently when subjected to DAP deprivation than when exposed to Nal. Our study shows that postconjugational counterselection based on DAP deprivation circumvents the use of antibiotics and will facilitate the transfer of plasmids into actinomycetes with high biotechnological potential, yet currently not accessible to conjugative techniques.
