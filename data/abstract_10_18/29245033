Triclosan (TCS) is an antimicrobial agent used in a range of personal care and consumer products and is commonly detected in aquatic ecosystems. In the present study, the effects of TCS at the molecular level on the detoxification system of Chironomus riparius aquatic larvae, a test organism widely used for the assessment of aquatic toxicology, were evaluated. The obtained results show that this xenobiotic was able to induce significant changes in transcripts from different cytochrome P450s and glutathione s-transferases genes, involved in phase I and phase II of detoxification system, respectively. In contrast, TCS did not affect the glutathione S-transferase enzyme activity nor the expression pattern of multidrug resistance-associated protein 1, which belongs to phase III of detoxification system. These results provide information about the effects of TCS on the detoxification mechanism of C. riparius and offers different biomarker genes that could be useful in ecotoxicological studies, risk assessment and bioremediation.
