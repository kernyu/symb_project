Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative bacillus that is most frequently associated with opportunistic infection, but which can also present in the otherwise healthy patient. The range of P. aeruginosa infections varies from localized infections of the skin to life-threatening systemic disease. Many P. aeruginosa infections are marked by characteristic cutaneous manifestations. The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive synthesis of the current knowledge of cutaneous manifestations of P. aeruginosa infection with specific emphasis on clinical features and management. The ability of P. aeruginosa to rapidly acquire antibacterial resistance is an increasingly well recognized phenomenon, and the correct application of antipseudomonal therapy is therefore of the utmost importance. A detailed discussion of currently available anti-pseudomonal agents is included, and the benefits of antimicrobial combination therapy versus monotherapy are explored. Rapid clinical recognition of P. aeruginosa infection aided by the identification of characteristic cutaneous manifestations can play a critical role in the successful management of potentially life-threatening disease.
