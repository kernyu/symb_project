An electrochemical assay has been designed to rapidly diagnose influenza viruses. Exposure of a glucose-bearing substrate to influenza viruses or its enzyme, neuraminidase (NA), releases glucose, which was detected amperometrically. Two methods were used to detect released glucose. First, we used a standard glucose blood meter to detect two viral NAs and three influenza strains. We also demonstrated drug susceptibility of two antivirals, Zanamivir and Oseltamivir, using the assay. Finally, we used disposable test strips to detect nineteen H1N1 and H3N2 influenza strains using this assay in one hour. The limit and range of detection of this first generation assay is 10(2) and 10(2)-10(8) plaque forming units (pfu), respectively. Current user-friendly glucose meters can be repurposed to detect influenza viruses.
