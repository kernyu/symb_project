Carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Acinetobacter baumannii were isolated from a single patient, each producing different carbapenemases (NDM-1, KPC-2, IMP, and OXA-23, respectively). The NDM-1-producing E. coli strain was preceded by a clonally related carbapenem-susceptible strain a month earlier, suggesting in vivo acquisition of blaNDM-1.
