qnrE1, found in a clinical Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate, was undetectable by PCR assays used for the six qnr families. qnrE1 was located on a conjugative plasmid (ca. 185 kb) and differed from qnrB alleles by 25%. Phylogenetic reconstructions of qnr genes and proteins and analysis of the qnrE1 surroundings showed that this gene belongs to a new qnr family and was likely mobilized by ISEcp1 from the chromosome of Enterobacter spp. to plasmids of K. pneumoniae.
