BACKGROUND: Infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric oncology. Resistance pattern of bacterial isolates determine empiric antibiotic therapy and influence outcome. AIMS: This study was planned to determine profile of bacterial isolates and their antibiotic resistance pattern among pediatric cancer patients. DESIGN: It was a retrospective, single institutional study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was carried out in the department of pediatric hematology-oncology of a tertiary care cancer centre in north India over a period of 24 months (2012-2014). Microbiological data pertaining to pediatric cancer patients, less than 18 yrs of age was analysed. RESULTS: Hence, 238 bacterial isolates were cultured from among 1757 blood, urine and other specimens. Gram negative bacteria were the most common (74%) pathogens identified and E. coli and Klebsiella comprised 80% of them. A high incidence of extended spectrum beta lactamase producing organisms (84%), beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor (78%) and carbapenem resistance was observed (29%). Blood stream infection with multi-drug resistant Klebsiella was associated with high mortality. The gram positive bacteria isolated were predominantly staphylococcus aureus and were antibiotic sensitive. Reduction in the number of culture positive isolates in the second year of our study was probably due to rigorous implementation of infection control measures. CONCLUSION: These results on microbiologic profile and antibiotic sensitivity pattern of the isolates will be extremely helpful in revision of antibiotic guidelines for our patients and in developing strategies for coping with high prevalence of multi-drug resistance. Antibiotic stewardship and strict implementation of infection control practices will be important components of this effort.
