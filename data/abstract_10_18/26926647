Measurement of vancomycin susceptibility has been shown to be highly predictive as a surrogate measure of oritavancin susceptibility among clinically indicated Gram-positive species. Results of studying over 30,000 pathogens (from 2011 to 2014) by cross-susceptibility analysis and determining the poor reproducibility of oritavancin-nonsusceptible results showed nearly perfect surrogate testing accuracy (99.86 to 99.94%). Any isolate of an indicated organism species with locally reproducible oritavancin-nonsusceptible results (extremely rare) should be referred to a reference laboratory for confirmation of the results and determination of the resistance mechanism.
