Our group has focused on expanding the scope of a two-metal binding pharmacophore concept to explore HIV-1 integrase inhibitors through medicinal chemistry efforts to design novel scaffolds which allow for improvement of pharmacokinetic (PK) and resistance profiles. A novel chelating scaffold was rationally designed to effectively coordinate two magnesium cofactors and to extend an aromatic group into an optimal hydrophobic pharmacophore space. The new chemotype, consisting of a carbamoyl pyridone core unit, shows high inhibitory potency in both enzymatic and antiviral assay formats with low nM IC(5)(0) and encouraging potency shift effects in the presence of relevant serum proteins. The new inhibitor design displayed a remarkable PK profile suggestive of once daily dosing without the need for a PK booster as demonstrated by robust drug concentrations at 24 h after oral dosing in rats, dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys.
