Intensive use of anthelmintics to control gastrointestinal nematodes selects for anthelmintic resistance, which has become an important issue in many European countries. Presence of nematode strains resistant to benzimidazoles, imidazothiazoles and/or macrocyclic lactones has been repeatedly reported, particularly for the three most important genera, Haemonchus, Teladorsagia and Trichostrongylus. Additionally, multiple drug-resistant populations of these parasites have also been detected. Examples are given for the situation in European countries with differing climatic conditions and management systems of small ruminants. The widespread emergence of multi-resistant nematodes proves that the past intensive suppressive chemical control strategies may not be a successful approach any longer. Experience from the up to now development of anthelmintic resistance suggests that modern control schemes should not rely on sole use of anthelmintics, but employ other, more complex and sustainable recipes, combing chemical, environmental and immunological control.
