Current increases in antifungal drug resistance in Candida spp. and clinical treatment failures are of concern, as invasive candidiasis is a significant cause of mortality in intensive care units (ICUs). This trend reflects the large and expanding use of newer broad-spectrum antifungal agents, such as triazoles and echinocandins. In this review, we firstly present an overview of the mechanisms of action of the drugs and of resistance in pathogenic yeasts, subsequently focusing on recent changes in the epidemiology of antifungal resistance in ICU. Then, we emphasize the clinical impacts of these current trends. The emergence of clinical treatment failures due to resistant isolates is described. We also consider the clinical usefulness of recent advances in the interpretation of antifungal susceptibility testing and in molecular detection of the mutations underlying acquired resistance. We pay particular attention to practical issues relating to ICU patient management, taking into account the growing threat of antifungal drug resistance.
