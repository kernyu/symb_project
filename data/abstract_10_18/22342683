Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is frequently activated in human cancers; however, clinical trials of rapalog (the mTORC1 inhibitors) have shown that pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) resist to the treatment. Rapalog treatment activated the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway in K-Ras mt PDAC cells. K-Ras knockdown abolished the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)-induced ERK pathway in the K-Ras mt PDAC cells and enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of everolimus in treating K-Ras mt PDAC cells-derived mouse xenografts. The results indicate that targeting of K-Ras mutation may lead to the development of therapies that overcome rapalog resistance in PDAC.
