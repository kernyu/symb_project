We report here on the first identification of Shigella flexneri subserotype 1c in China. We also report the emergence of resistance to ciprofloxacin and third-generation cephalosporins in this subserotype 1c for the first time. Isolates of seven strains circulating in China yielded three new sequence types and seven pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns, thus demonstrating the existence of high genetic diversity within the isolates. Overall, the seven isolates showed reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin; one isolate was ciprofloxacin resistant, whilst another developed resistance to ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone.
