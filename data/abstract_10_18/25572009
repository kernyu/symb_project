To improve the efficacy of therapeutic options in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) an in vitro system to determine the response of mononuclear blood cells from blood of patients was elaborated. The study combines four approaches, i.e., cell viability, apoptosis rate, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and immunoblotting to develop personalized therapy protocols based on the cell sensitivity to drug exposure of individual CLL patients. The complementary analyses were performed on 28 peripheral blood samples from previously untreated CLL patients before therapy. The induction and progress of apoptosis in CLL cells exposed in vitro to purine analogs combined with mafosfamide, i.e., cladribine + mafosfamide (CM) and fludarabine + mafosfamide (FM) were assessed using the above approaches. The changes in thermal profiles (decrease/loss of transition at 95+/-5 C) coincided with an accumulation of apoptotic cells, a decrease in the number of viable cells, and differences in the expression of the apoptosisrelated protein PARP1. No significant changes were observed in the thermal profiles of nuclei isolated from CLL cells resistant to the treatment. The complementary assays revealed a strong relationship between both the in vitro sensitivity of leukemia cells to drugs and the clinical response of the patients, determined usually after the sixth course of treatment (after ~6 months of therapy). As a summary of studies followed by complementary tests, our findings demonstrate the value of in vitro exposure of CLL cell samples to drugs intended to treat CLL patients, before their administration in order to recommend the most suitable and effective therapy for individual patients.
