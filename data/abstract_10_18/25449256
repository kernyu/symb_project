The development of macrolide resistance that occurred during 3 days of therapy with azithromycin to treat Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia in a paediatric patient is reported. After extended molecular characterization of strains, the parallel occurrence of clones showing the non-mutated wild-type 23S rRNA sequence as well as mutations A2063G and A2064G, which are both responsible for phenotypic resistance, was confirmed for the first time.
