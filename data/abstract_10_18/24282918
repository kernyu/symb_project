UNLABELLED: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the characteristics of patients admitted to Bella Vista Hospital in Mayaguez with a diagnosis of infected skin ulcer, the most common microorganisms recovered in cultures, and their antimicrobial sensitivity patterns. METHODS: All patients discharged with the diagnosis of infected skin ulcer from January 1 through December 31, 2012 were selected. Following variables were extracted: sex, age, hospital stay, morbid conditions, antibiotics used, microorganisms identified on cultures and sensitivity of microorganisms to different antimicrobials. Prevalence rates were estimated for different conditions and different microorganisms. The use of empirical antibiotics were described and compared with the antimicrobial sensitivity of the microorganisms. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 98 subjects (54% female, 46% male). Mean age was 71 years old, with 71% of subjects older than 65 years old. Prevalence rates of diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension and osteomyelitis were 74.5%, 74.5%, 79.6%, and 17.5% respectively. The antibiotic most frequently used was piperacyllin-tazobactam (PTZ). The organisms most frequently found on cultures were Staphylococcus (37.8%), distributed as 20.4% methicillin resistant and 17.3 sensitive to methicillin, followed by E. coli (30.6%), Streptococcus (29.6%), and Pseudomonas (27.6%). The majority of microorganisms were sensitive to PTZ. There was a higher prevalence of osteomyelitis in diabetic patients than in non-diabetic patients but the difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic sensitivity patterns were consistent with the expected, according to the literature. Empirically used antibiotics were appropriate according to sensitivity patterns shown in the study.
