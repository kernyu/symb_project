Antibiotic misuse contributes to the growing problem of microbial resistance. To understand the current knowledge and practices regarding antibiotic use among Syrians, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 430 randomly selected adult residents of Kalamoon in the Syrian Arab Republic using a questionnaire. A high proportion (85%) had taken antibiotics in the past 4 weeks and 34% were not aware of the dangers of antibiotics. Of 365 participants, only 43% were prescribed the antibiotic by a physician to treat the condition, while 57% used an old prescription or took someone else's advice. Males, younger individuals, and those with low and medium income and lower educational status showed poorer practice and lower knowledge towards antibiotics. Educational efforts are needed to reduce patient demand for antibiotics.
