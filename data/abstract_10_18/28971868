Carbapenemase-producing bacteria cause difficult-to-treat infections related to increased mortality in health care settings. Their occurrence has been reported in raw sewage, sewage-impacted rivers, and polluted coastal waters, which may indicate their spread to the community. We assessed the variety and concentration of carbapenemase producers in coastal waters with distinct pollution levels for 1 year. We describe various bacterial species producing distinct carbapenemases not only in unsuitable waters but also in waters considered suitable for primary contact.
