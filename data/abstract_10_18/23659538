A carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated from a blood-culture of an inpatient from Libya, hospitalized in the intensive-care unit of Negrar Hospital, Italy. The clinical isolate carried the following beta-lactamase genes, bla(TEM -1), bla(SHV -11), bla(OXA -1), bla(CTX -M-15) and bla(OXA -48), respectively. The bla(OXA -48) gene was inserted in the Tn1999.2 transposon type, carried on a conjugative, 60-kilobase plasmid, that presented an L/M backbone, hosted by a multidrug-resistant ST 101 K. pneumoniae strain. Our report highlights the international transfer of bla(OXA -48) gene and the importance of screening measures of multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae.
