BACKGROUND: Acinetobacter baumannii, an opportunistic nosocomial pathogen that can cause significant morbidity and mortality, has emerged as a worldwide problem. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk factors for mortality in patients with A. baumannii bacteremia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 118 patients who had A. baumannii bacteremia between July 2003 and December 2011. The aim of this study was to identify the 30-day mortality in patients with A. baumannii bacteremia and relevant risk factors. RESULTS: The bacteremia-related 30-day mortality rate was 34.1%. Univariate analysis revealed that the risk factors for mortality included malignancy, longer hospital stay before bacteremia, intensive care unit (ICU) stay at the time of bacteremia, mechanical ventilation, use of a central venous catheter, unknown origin of bacteremia, bacteremia due to pneumonia, antimicrobial resistance to carbapenems, and elevated Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II and Pitt bacteremia scores. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that resistance to carbapenems (odds ratio [OR]: 4.01, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.51 to 0.68, P = 0.005), need for mechanical ventilation (OR: 3.97, 95% CI: 1.41 to 11.13, P = 0.005), and presence of malignancy (OR: 4.40, 95% CI: 1.60 to 12.08, P = 0.004) were significantly related to mortality risk. CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors such as resistance to carbapenems, mechanical ventilation, and presence of malignancy were found to be associated with high mortality rates in the patients with A. baumannii bacteremia.
