Management of nosocomial pneumonia is frequently complicated by bacterial resistance. Extended infusions of beta-lactams are increasingly being used to improve clinical outcomes. However, the impact of this strategy on the emergence of antimicrobial resistance is not known. A hollow-fiber infection model with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO1) was used. Pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of piperacillin-tazobactam similar to those in humans were simulated over 5 days. Three dosages of piperacillin-tazobactam were administered over 0.5 h or 4 h, with redosing every 8 h. Two initial bacterial densities were investigated ( approximately 10(4) CFU/ml and approximately 10(7) CFU/ml). The time courses of the total bacterial population and the resistant subpopulation were determined. All data were described using a mathematical model, which was then used to define the relationship between drug concentrations, bacterial killing, and emergence of piperacillin resistance. There was logarithmic growth in controls in the initial 24 h, reaching a plateau of approximately 9 log10 CFU/ml. Bacterial killing following administration of piperacillin via bolus dosing and that after extended infusions were similar. For the lower initial bacterial density, trough total plasma piperacillin concentration/MIC ratios of 3.4 and 10.4 for bolus and extended-infusion regimens, respectively, were able to suppress the emergence of piperacillin resistance. For the higher initial bacterial density, all regimens were associated with progressive growth of a resistant subpopulation. A stratified approach, according to bacterial density, is required to treat patients with nosocomial pneumonia. Antimicrobial monotherapy may be sufficient for some patients. However, for patients with a high bacterial burden, alternative therapeutic strategies are required to maximize bacterial killing and prevent antimicrobial resistance.
