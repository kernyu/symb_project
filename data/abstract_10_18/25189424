The host's immune defence mechanisms are indispensable factors in surviving bacterial infections. However, in many circumstances, the immune system alone is inadequate. Since the 1940s, the use of antibacterial therapy has saved millions of lives, improving the span and quality of life of individuals. Unfortunately, we are now facing an era where antibacterial agents are threatened by resistance. In addition to targeting bacteria, some antibacterial agents affect various aspects of the immune response to infection. Since many antibacterial drugs are failing in efficacy due to resistance, it has been strongly suggested that any synergy between these drugs and the immune response be exploited in the treatment of bacterial infections. This review explores the influence of antibacterial therapy on the immune response and new approaches that could exploit this interaction for the treatment of bacterial infections.
