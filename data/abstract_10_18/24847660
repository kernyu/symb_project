New antibiotics are highly needed due to continuously emerging resistances, in particular for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Only a few new generation antibiotics with new mechanisms of action are available or in development in the recent years. Promising emerging drug candidates with a new mechanism of action are the synthetic guanidine-based polymers based on Akacid. They are highly potent against a wide range of microorganisms and have a beneficial safety profile as reflected in their excellent tolerability when applied to skin, mucosa or eyes. There is a high potential for topical and systemic use of Akacid as an antibiotic in humans and animals, in particular in cases of resistant microorganisms.
