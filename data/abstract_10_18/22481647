BACKGROUND: The use of topical antifungal agents in the treatment of onychomycosis is of great value in clinical practice as there are different limitations regarding the use of systemic treatment. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a nail lacquer formulation containing ciclopirox 8% in two different posologies: the traditional regimen (3/2/1) and a regimen of weekly use. METHODS: A blind, randomized, comparative trial which included 41 patients divided into 02 groups, with Group I using the nail lacquer once weekly and Group II using the traditional regimen (3/2/1). Both groups applied the medication for 06 months. RESULTS: The species most frequently found in groups I and II were Trichophyton rubrum (55% and 61.9%) and Trichophyton mentagrophytes (30% and 19%). There was a tendency to a higher level of treatment resistance by T. mentagrophytes infection in both groups, without any predilection for sex, age, proportion of the nail affected at the beginning of the study, duration of the clinical disease and quantity of nails affected per person. Both groups had significant levels of mycological cure, clinical response and therapeutic success and there was no statistically significant difference between groups I and II (p >0.05). CONCLUSION: The nail lacquer containing ciclopirox 8% was equally effective at a weekly dose when compared to the traditional dosing (3/2/1), allowing a more comfortable regimen.
