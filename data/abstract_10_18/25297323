Seven imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were recovered from the sputum samples of pneumonia patients in southwestern China. They had identical antibiotic resistance patterns and indistinguishable pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profiles. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a 4-bp (AGTC) insertion in the oprD gene, resulting in a frameshift in the cognate open reading frame. These isolates became imipenem susceptible when the chromosomal oprD lesion was complemented, indicating that the 4-bp insertion in the oprD gene resulted in imipenem resistance.
