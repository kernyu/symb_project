The Xpert(R) MTB/RIF assay detects the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its resistance to rifampicin (RMP) directly in sputum samples. Discrepant results were observed in a case of smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis that was Xpert-resistant but phenotypically susceptible to RMP. Complementary investigations (repeat Xpert, Genotype(R)MTBDRplus assay and sequencing of the rpoB gene) revealed the presence of a silent mutation in the rpoB gene, leading to the conclusion of a false-positive Xpert result. As misinterpretation of Xpert results may lead to inappropriate treatment, the presence of rpoB mutations should be confirmed by sequencing the rpoB gene.
