BACKGROUND: In Vietnam, the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Beijing genotype is associated with multi-drug resistance and is emerging. A possible explanation for this genotype's success is an increased rate of relapse. METHODS: In a prospective cohort study, isolates from patients with smear-positive tuberculosis were subjected to drug susceptibility testing and to spoligotyping and variable number of tandem repeats typing before treatment and after recurrence of tuberculosis. RESULTS: Among 1068 patients who were actively followed up over 18 months for recurrence, 23 relapse cases occurred (1.39 cases/100 person-years). After adjustment for genotype, tuberculosis treatment history, and drug resistance, relapse was significantly associated with the Beijing genotype (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 5.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.06-14.55) and isoniazid resistance (aHR, 5.91; 95% CI, 2.16-16.16). CONCLUSIONS: The strongly increased relapse rate in tuberculosis cases caused by Beijing strains probably contributes to the successful spread of this genotype in Vietnam and elsewhere.
