BACKGROUND: Hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) promoter (LIPE-60 C > G) polymorphism has been found to be involved in hepatic steatosis, obesity, diabetes and dyslipidemia. The precise interactions between these risk factors and genetic susceptibility that may affect non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are still not fully determined. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 1056 men. To avoid the confounding effect of plasma glucose, the study population was classified into normal glucose tolerance (NGT, n = 729) and glucose intolerance (GI, n = 299) groups. NAFLD was diagnosed by abdominal ultrasound after ruling out any history of alcohol abuse. A multivariate regression model was used to estimate the impact of these factors on NAFLD. RESULTS: In the NGT group, subjects with NAFLD often have complicated metabolic abnormalities. The coexistence of NAFLD and GI has been demonstrated to have a synergistic effect raising BMI, serum insulin and HOMA-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). BMI and adipose-insulin resistance (Adipo-IR), but not HOMA-IR, significantly contributed to a greater risk of developing NAFLD. Serum triglyceride was significantly up-regulated in men with the (CG + GG) genotype of HSL promoter polymorphism, NAFLD and Adiopo-IR in sequence. CONCLUSION: Adipo-IR, rather than HOMA-IR, appears to be a consistent insulin resistance index in the study of NAFLD. G allele of the HSL promoter polymorphism may contribute the greatest impact raising serum triglyceride in a state of glucose intolerance.
