Treatment with interferon beta (IFN-beta) induces the production of binding antibodies (BAbs) and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). NAbs against IFN-beta are associated with a loss of IFN-beta bioactivity and decreased clinical efficacy of the drug. The objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence and the prevalence of binding antibodies (BAbs) and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) to IFN-beta in MS patients receiving CinnoVex, Rebif, or Betaferon. The presence of BAbs was studied in serum samples from 124 MS patients using one of these IFN-beta medications by ELISA. The NAbs against IFN-beta were measured in BAb-positive MS patients receiving IFN-beta using an MxA gene expression assay (real-time RT-PCR). Of the 124 patients, 36 (29.03%) had BAbs after at least 12 months of IFN-beta treatment. The proportion of BAb+ was 38.1% for Betaferon, 21.9% for Rebif, and 26.8% for CinnoVex. Five BAb-positive MS patients were lost to follow-up; thus 31 BAb-positive MS patients were studied for NAbs. NAbs were present in 25 (80.6%) of BAb-positive MS patients receiving IFN-beta. In conclusion, the three IFN-beta preparations have different degrees of immunogenicity.
