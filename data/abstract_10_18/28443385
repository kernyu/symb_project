Objective To assess the application of antibacterial agents, alongside pathogen prevalence and Pseudomonas aeruginosa drug resistance, with the aim of understanding the impact of inappropriate antibacterial use. Methods This retrospective study assessed bacteria from wounds, catheters, blood, faeces, urine and sputum of hospitalized patients in burn wards between 2007 and 2014. The intensity of use of antibacterial agents and resistance of P. aeruginosa to common anti-Gram-negative antibiotics were measured. Results Annual detection rates of Staphylococcus aureus were significantly decreased, whereas annual detection rates of P. aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae were significantly increased. Multidrug-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa were increased. The intensity of use of some anti-Gramnegative antibiotics positively correlated with resistance rates of P. aeruginosa to similar antimicrobials. Conclusion In burn wards, more attention should be paid to P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae. The use of ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime and cefoperazone/sulbactam should be limited to counter the related increase in resistance levels.
