During the course of infection, bacteria must coordinately regulate gene expression in response to environmental stimuli. The phosphate (Pho) regulon is controlled by the two component-regulatory system PhoBR. PhoBR is activated during starvation and regulates genes involved in phosphate homeostasis. Several studies have highlighted the importance of the Pho regulon in bacterial pathogenesis, showing how induction of PhoBR, in addition to regulating genes participating in phosphate metabolism, leads to modulation of many cellular processes. The pleiotropic effects of Pho regulon activation include attenuated virulence and alteration of many virulence traits, including adhesion to host cells and resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides, acidity and oxidative stresses. This review provides an overview of the relationship between the Pho regulon and virulence in Escherichia coli and illustrates that, in addition to regulating phosphate homeostasis, the Pho regulon plays a key role in regulating stress responses and virulence.
