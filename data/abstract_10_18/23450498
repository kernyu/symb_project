BACKGROUND: An alarming rise in the rates of the antibiotic resistance has now become a serious and an increasingly common public health concern, with severe implications, especially in the intensive care units. A variety of beta-lactamases which include ESBLs, AmpC beta-lactamases and metallo-betalactamases, have emerged as the most worrisome mechanism of resistance among the gram negative bacteria, which pose a therapeutic challenge to the health care settings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study was aimed at knowing the prevalence of various beta-lactamases in the gram negative isolates which were obtained from ICU patients. A total 273 gram negative isolates from 913 clinical samples which were received over a period of one year were processed for their identification and their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern was determined. They were then screened for the beta-lactamase production. RESULTS: Among the 273 isolates, the beta-lactamase production was observed in 193 strains. 96 (35.16%) strains were ESBL producers, followed by 30 (10.98%) metallo beta- lactamase (MBL) producers and 15(5.4%) AmpC producers. The major ESBL and AmpC producer was Escherichia coli, while Klebsiella pneumonia was the predominant MBL producer. The co production of the ESBL/MBL/ AmpC beta- lactamases was observed in 52 (19.04%) strains and it was more common in Escherichia coli. A multidrug resistance to the fluoroquinolones and the aminoglycosides was also observed in the beta- lactamase producing organisms. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of the beta- lactamases in the ICU isolates emphasizes the need for a continuous surveillance in the ICUs to detect the resistant strains, strict guidelines for the antibiotic therapy and the implementation of infection control measures to reduce the increasing burden of antibiotic resistance.
