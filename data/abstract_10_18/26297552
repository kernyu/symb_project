For women infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who become pregnant, the use of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) significantly reduces transmission of HIV from mother to child. Selection of an appropriate ART regimen for use among pregnant women requires consideration of numerous factors including maternal and fetal safety, antiretroviral pharmacokinetics, and regimen efficacy. Optimization of antiretroviral pharmacokinetics during pregnancy requires special consideration because pregnancy-associated changes in drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion are known to occur throughout pregnancy and postpartum. Understanding antiretroviral placental transfer may offer additional insight into each drug's potential role in preventing HIV transmission in utero and may also have implications regarding viral resistance in cases where transmission does occur. In this review, we summarize key published data describing antiretroviral pharmacokinetics in pregnant women, providing suggestions for clinical application of these data where appropriate.
