The control of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) has become an increasing burden on health care resources since their discovery over 20 years ago. Current techniques employed for their detection include time-consuming and laborious phenotypic methods or molecular methods requiring costly equipment and consumables and highly trained staff. An accurate, rapid diagnostic test has the ability to greatly reduce the spread of this organism, which has the ability to colonize patients for long periods, potentially even lifelong. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is a technology with the ability to identify organisms in seconds and has shown promise in the identification of other forms of antimicrobial resistance in other organisms. Here we show that MALDI-TOF MS is capable of rapidly and accurately identifying vanB-positive Enterococcus faecium VRE from susceptible isolates. Internal validation of the optimal model generated produced a sensitivity of 92.4% and a specificity of 85.2%. Prospective validation results, following incorporation into the routine laboratory work flow, demonstrated a greater sensitivity and specificity at 96.7% and 98.1%, respectively. In addition, the utilization of MALDI-TOF MS to determine the relatedness of isolates contributing to an outbreak is also demonstrated.
