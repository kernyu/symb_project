Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a gram-negative bacteria, which is the most frequent cause of invasive neonatal infection. About 10-30% of pregnant woman are carriers of GBS. GBS infection is transmitted to neonates from colonized vagina. Children of those mothers have 25 times higher risk of early onset neonatal sepsis then of those not colonized. Colonization can be transient, intermittent or persistent that is why ano-vaginal swabs are taken between 35 to 37 gestation week. This is a primary way of defining a risk of neonatal GBS infection. Before the labor additional risk factors are determined. According to those two data a decision is made about intravenous administration of efficient antibiotic dose at least 4 hours before delivery. Selection ofintrapartum chemoprophylaxis depends on mothers drug allergies or given GBS strain resistance profile. GBS-positive mother's neonates should be under proper observation. When abnormal symptoms are present a full diagnostic evaluation should be made, including blood tests, lumbar puncture, chest X-Ray and cultures. Empirical antimicrobial treatment against E. coli and GBS should be administered. Current data concerning Group B Streptococcus infection epidemiology, standards of diagnosis, prophylaxis and treatment are quoted in the article.
