To obtain a high antimalarial activity with neocryptolepine derivatives, modifying and changing the side chains at the C11 position with varying the substituents of an electron-withdrawing or electron-donating nature at the C2 position for a SAR study were executed. Installation of alkylamino and omega-aminoalkylamino groups at the C11 position of the neocryptolepine core was successful. For further variation, the aminoalkylamino substituents were transformed into the corresponding acyclic or cyclic carbamides or thiocarbamides. These side chain modified neocryptolepine derivatives were tested for antimalarial activity against CQR (K1) and CQS (NF54) of Plasmodium falciparum in vitro and for cytotoxicity toward mammalian L6 cells. Among the tested compounds, the compound 17f showed an IC50 of 2.2 nM for CQS (NF54) and a selectivity index of 1400, and 17i showed an IC50 of 2.2 nM for CQR (K1), a selectivity index of 1243, and a resistance index of 0.5.
