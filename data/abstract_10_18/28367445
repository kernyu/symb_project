The aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial effect of the crude starter "kpete-kpete" and lactic acid bacteria used during the production of "tchoukoutou." To achieve this, a total of 11 lactic acid bacteria and 40 starter samples were collected from four communes. The samples were tested on 29 gram + and - strains by disk diffusion method. The minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of starter and lactic acid bacteria were determined by conventional methods. Organic acids, sugar, and volatile compounds were determined using the HPLC method. The "kpete-kpete" displays a high antibacterial activity against the tested strains. The most sensitive strain was S. epidermidis (12.5 mm) whereas the resistance strain was Proteus mirabilis (8 mm). All the tested ferment has not any inhibitory effect on Enterococcus faecalis. The lactic acid bacteria isolates of Parakou showed the highest (17.48 mm) antibacterial activity whereas the smallest diameter was obtained with the ferment collected from Boukoumbe (9.80 mm). The starters' chemical screening revealed the presence of tannins, anthocyanin flavonoids, triterpenes, steroids, reducing compounds, and mucilage O-glycosides. These compounds are probably the source of recorded inhibition effect. The lactic acid bacteria of the "kpete-kpete" could be used to develop a food ingredient with probiotic property.
