Bioelectrochemical systems can effectively degrade antibiotics, but there is the need to better understand the fate of antibiotic resistance bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes during the bioelectrochemical degradation of antibiotics. In this study, a BES was developed as a platform to investigate the fate of chloramphenicol resistance bacteria (CRB) and the expression of chloramphenicol resistance genes (CRGs) under different operating conditions during chloramphenicol biodegradation. The results indicated that chloramphenicol was effectively removed and chloramphenicol removal efficiency could be improved under less chloramphenicol concentration and more negative cathode potential. Higher chloramphenicol concentration enhanced the enrichment of CRB and expression of CRGs. Furthermore, the abundances of CRB were enhanced under more negative cathode potential, the expression of CRGs under less negative cathode potential were induced. However, both the enrichment of CRB and expression of CRGs could be moderated under a medium cathode potential. This result could provide the scientific reference for research about the fate of antibiotic resistance genes in bioelectrochemical systems.
