The combination of lenalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (RVD) has shown excellent efficacy in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). The aim of our study was to assess the efficacy and toxicity profile of RVD for patients with advanced RRMM. We retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients with RRMM treated with RVD between March 2009 and December 2011. Thirty patients received >/= 1 full cycle of RVD. Primary endpoints were overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). After a median of 5 cycles (1-16), a very good partial response (VGPR) was seen in 10%, partial response (PR) in 36.7% and stable disease (SD) in 13.3% (ORR of 46.7%). Disease progression occurred in 21 patients at a median of 3 months (range 1.41-4.59). Eight patients (26%) experienced grade 3/4 adverse events, including anemia, neutropenia, muscle weakness and pneumonia. No patient experienced worsening peripheral neuropathy. Although RVD has been previously shown to be effective in RRMM, the ORR and PFS we observed were affected by very advanced disease status and heavy prior exposure to novel agents. Nevertheless, six of these patients with RRMM experienced a benefit of >/= 6 months, suggesting synergism of this immunomodulatory derivative/proteasome inhibitor combination and/or re-establishment of drug sensitivity by an emergent myeloma clone.
