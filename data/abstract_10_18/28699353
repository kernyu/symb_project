Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a stable product of water radiolysis, occurring at nanomolar concentration upon low-dose ionizing radiation (LDIR) (<100 mGy). In view of the recent recognition of H2O2 as a central redox signaling molecule that, likewise, is maintained in the nanomolar range in cells, we propose a role for H2O2 in radiation hormesis. LDIR is capable of utilizing known molecular redox master switches such as Nrf2/Keap1 or NF-kappaB/IkappaB to effect adaptive resistance. This leads to the hypothesis that, as a normal component of the exposome, LDIR mediates hormetic effects by H2O2 signaling. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 27, 596-598.
