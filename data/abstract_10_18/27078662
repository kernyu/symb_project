Trichomonosis, caused by the protozoan parasite Trichomonas vaginalis, is a curable sexually transmitted disease that is most commonly encountered worldwide. Increasing importance of trichomoniasis and emerging of resistance against metronidazole lead to search for alternative drugs with different mode of activity. The purpose of this study was to determine in vitro activity of ceragenins (CSA-13, CSA-44, CSA-13, and CSA-138) against the metronidazole-susceptible (ATCC 30001) and metronidazole-resistant (ATCC 50138) strains of T. vaginalis. The effective concentrations were evaluated using two strains of T. vaginalis with different metronidazole susceptibilities (ATCC 30001 and ATCC 50138) in the presence of dilution series of ceragenins in 24-well microtitre assays. Overall, all the ceragenins killed the metronidazole-susceptible (ATCC 30001) and metronidazole-resistant (ATCC 50138) strains of T. vaginalis (p>0.05). With regard to the their effects against the studied strains of T. vaginalis, in order of effectiveness, overall, the ceragenins ordered as CSA-13 (the most effective), CSA-131 and CSA-138 (effective similarly), and CSA-44 (the least effective) (p<0.05). All of the ceragenins reduced the trophozoite numbers of both of studied strains of T. vaginalis with a time- and dose- dependent manner (p<0.05). Although all of the study ceragenins, CSA-13, CSA-44, CSA-13, and CSA-138, killed the studied strains of T. vaginalis. CSA-13 is the leading ceragenin as the most effective anti-trichomonas compound, followed by CSA-131 and CSA-138. They have a potential to have a place in the armemantarium of gynecologic and urologic practice for the management of sexually transmitted diseases.
