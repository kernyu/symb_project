Extraintestinal Escherichia coli infections are associated with extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) strains. A total of 114 E. coli isolates were characterized regarding their antimicrobial resistance in a prospective study of 319 broilers from 12 slaughterhouses in the Czech Republic, a European Union member, during 2008. PCR-based assays to define ExPEC-associated traits were performed in resistant strains. Consumption of antimicrobial drugs by poultry in the Czech Republic was also analyzed. Antibiotic resistance was detected in 82% of isolates. Resistance to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin was predominant. Plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes, qnrB19 and qnrS1, were detected in 1 and 3 of 93 resistant isolates, respectively. Twenty-three percent of resistant isolates were considered as ExPEC. In total, 972 kg of flumequine, enrofloxacin, and difloxacin were used in poultry in the Czech Republic during 2008. High prevalence of broilers with ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli isolates was linked to consumption of quinolones in poultry. Broilers may comprise an important vehicle for community-wide dissemination of fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli and ExPEC. Withdrawal of fluoroquinolones from use in chicken production should be seriously considered in the Czech Republic and the European Union as well.
