OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the need for bacteriological analysis for the rational treatment of infections of the corneal surface, including conjunctivitis. METHODS: The results of 1,970 consecutive bacteriological analysis obtained from 2001 to 2008 in patients with ocular hyperemia and discharge were analysed and compared with a similar study done in 1982 in the same geographical area. RESULTS: Bacterial growth was obtained in 1,044 cases (53%). The most frequent bacteria were Staphylococci spp. (56.6%), followed by Streptococci spp. (21.4%), Haemophili spp. (12.1%), and other gram-negative bacteria (9.9%). No antibiotic was effective against all the bacteria isolated. The frequency of resistant bacteria against neomycin, tobramycin, erythromycin and gentamicin was significantly increased with respect to the study of 1982. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteriological analysis of conjunctival specimens are necessary to ensure the choice of an effective antibiotic against bacteria of the ocular surface when the initial treatment fails.
