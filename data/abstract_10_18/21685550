A 14 year old common variable immunodeficiency patient developed severe protein-losing enteropathy. A chronic enteral infection with human parechovirus type 1 and norovirus was diagnosed. Treatment strategies aimed at virus eradication and providing supportive care were ineffective. The antipicornavirus agent pleconaril did not have any effect on viral replication. Symptoms improved on immunosuppressive therapy, suggesting infection-related immune dysregulation in an immunocompromised host.
