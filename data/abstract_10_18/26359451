Survival rates associated with pancreatic cancer remain dismal despite advancements in detection and experimental treatment strategies. Genetically engineered mouse models of pancreatic tumorigenesis have gained considerable attention based on their ability to recapitulate key clinical features of human disease including chemotherapeutic resistance and fibrosis. However, it is unclear if transgenic systems exemplified by the Kras(G12D)/Trp53(R172H)/Pdx-1-Cre (KPC) mouse model recapitulate the functional heterogeneity of human pancreatic tumors harboring distinct cells with tumorigenic properties. To facilitate tracking of heterogeneous tumor cell populations, we incorporated a luciferase-based tag into the genetic background of the KPC mouse model. We isolated pancreatic cancer cells from multiple independent tumor lines and found that roughly 1 out of 87 cells exhibited tumorigenic capability. Notably, this frequency is significantly higher than reported for human pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Cancer stem cell (CSC) markers, including CD133, CD24, Sca-1, and functional Aldefluor activity, were unable to discriminate tumorigenic from nontumorigenic cells in syngeneic transplants. Furthermore, three-dimensional spheroid cultures originating from KPC tumors did not enrich for cells with stem-like characteristics and were not significantly more tumorigenic than cells cultured as monolayers. Additionally, we did not observe significant differences in response to gemcitabine or salinomycin in several isolated subpopulations. Taken together, these studies show that the hierarchical organization of CSCs in human disease is not recapitulated in a commonly used mouse model of pancreatic cancer and therefore provide a new view of the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of tumor cells.
