In this issue of Chemistry & Biology, Forsberg et al. (2015) show how metagenomics and biological chemistry can be combined to discover new classes of antibiotic resistance from soil metagenomes. The authors specifically reveal previously unseen resistance mechanisms and genes evident in soils, which will better inform both environmental and clinical studies on antibiotic resistance.
