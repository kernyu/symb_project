BACKGROUND: Some HIV protease inhibitors (PIs), including full-dose ritonavir (800 mg) and ritonavir-boosted lopinavir, acutely induce insulin resistance in the absence of HIV infection and changes in body composition. Boosting dose ritonavir (100-200 mg) is the most commonly prescribed PI, yet its effects on glucose metabolism have not been described in the absence of another PI. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, cross-over study, a single dose of ritonavir 200 mg or placebo was given to healthy HIV-seronegative volunteers before assessment of insulin sensitivity by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. RESULTS: Boosting dose ritonavir had no effect on insulin-mediated glucose disposal (M/I, placebo: 8.59 +/- 0.83 vs. ritonavir: 8.51 +/- 0.64 mg/kg per minute per muU/mL insulin, P = 0.89). CONCLUSIONS: A single boosting dose of ritonavir does not alter insulin sensitivity, suggesting lopinavir is likely responsible for the induction of insulin resistance demonstrated in prior short-term studies of lopinavir/ritonavir. There is a dose-dependent effect of ritonavir on insulin sensitivity.
