The T315I mutation is especially challenging as it confers resistance to all first- and second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We present here a chronic myeloid leukemia patient harboring the T315I and E255V BCR-ABL1 mutation successfully achieved deep molecular response with a combined treatment of dasatinib and IFN-alpha. To our knowledge, this is the second case of a T315I-bearing chronic myeloid leukemia patient displaying satisfactory response to the combination therapy of dasatinib and IFN-alpha.
