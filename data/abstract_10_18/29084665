This study was designed to discuss key points regarding the clinical observations and nursing of patients with acute pancreatitis and stress ulcer bleeding. Retrospective analysis of 280 cases admitted to our hospital between January 2010 and January 2015 with acute pancreatitis and stress ulcer bleeding. At the same time, we treated patients with antimicrobial agents based on the epidemiology of sever acute pancreatitis (SAP) infection. According to the results of bacterial culture and drug sensitivity, we analyzed the sequence of pathogenic bacteria and the rate of bacterial resistance. During hospitalization, patients were given omeprazole and other intravenous drip line. Within this group, there was one death. The rest were all cured and discharged. Cases of acute pancreatitis, especially cases combined with biliary stone obstruction, pancreatic abscess, or pancreatic pseudo cyst are likely to show stress ulcer hemorrhage. There is a high risk of bleeding within 7 weeks of onset. The key is good nursing assessment and dynamic observation. Timely and effective anti-shock treatment is crucial to nursing when cooperating in rescues.
