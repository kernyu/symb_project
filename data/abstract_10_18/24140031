BACKGROUND: The S282T mutation is the main variant described associated with resistance to nucleos(t)ide analogues hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B polymerase inhibitors. OBJECTIVE: We aimed here to investigate whether this substitution pre-existed in treatment naive HCV/HIV-1 coinfected patients. STUDY DESIGN: NS5B polymerase deep sequencing was performed at a median coverage per base of 4471 in 16 patient samples. RESULTS: No S282T variant was detected in the 16 analyzed samples. CONCLUSION: This finding is in agreement with the high genetic barrier of nucleoside analogues NS5B polymerase inhibitors and the clinical efficacy of these compounds.
