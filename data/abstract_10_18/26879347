BACKGROUND: Salmonellae are major worldwide zoonotic pathogens infecting a wide range of vertebrate species including humans. Consumption of contaminated dairy products and contact with dairy cattle represent a common source of non-typhoidal Salmonella infection in humans. Despite a large number of small-scale dairy farms in Addis Ababa and its surrounding districts, little is known about the status of Salmonella in these farms. RESULTS: Salmonella was recovered from the feces of at least one animal in 7.6% (10/132) of the dairy farms. Out of 1203 fecal samples examined, 30 were positive for Salmonella resulting in a weighted animal level prevalence of 2.3%. Detection of diarrhea in an animal and in a farm was significantly associated with animal level (p = 0.012) and herd level (p < 0.001) prevalence of Salmonella. Animal level prevalence of Salmonella was significantly associated with age (p = 0.023) and study location; it was highest among those under 6 months of age and in farms from Adaa district and Addis Ababa (p < 0.001). Nine different serotypes were identified using standard serological agglutination tests. The most frequently recovered serotypes were Salmonella Typhimurium (23.3%), S. Saintpaul (20%), S. Kentucky (16.7%) and S. Virchow (16.7%). All isolates were resistant or intermediately resistant to at least one of the 18 drugs tested. Twenty-six (86.7%), 19 (63.3 %), 18 (60%), 16 (53.3%) of the isolates were resistant to streptomycin, nitrofurantoin, sulfisoxazole and tetracycline , respectively. Resistance to 2 drugs was detected in 27 (90%) of the isolates. Resistance to 3 or more drugs was detected in 21 (70%) of the isolates, while resistance to 7 or more drugs was detected in 11 (36.7%) of the isolates. The rate of occurrence of multi-drug resistance (MDR) in Salmonella strains isolated from dairy farms in Addis Ababa was significantly higher than those isolated from farms outside of Addis Ababa (p = 0.009). MDR was more common in S. Kentucky, S. Virchow and S. Saintpaul. CONCLUSION: Isolation of Salmonella serotypes commonly known for causing human salmonellosis that are associated with an MDR phenotype in dairy farms in close proximity with human population is a major public health concern. These findings imply the need for a strict pathogen reduction strategy.
