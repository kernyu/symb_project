The spread of antimicrobial-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae worldwide is a critical issue in the control of sexually transmitted infections. The purpose of this study was to clarify recent trends in the susceptibility of N. gonorrhoeae to various antimicrobial agents and to compare these data with our previous data. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of various antimicrobial agents were determined in N. gonorrhoeae strains clinically isolated from male gonococcal urethritis. In addition, amino acid sequencing of penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 2, encoded by the penA gene, was analyzed so that genetic analysis of mosaic PBP 2 could clarify the susceptibility of the strains to cefixime and other cephalosporins. The susceptibility rate for ceftriaxone, cefodizime, and spectinomycin, agents whose use is recommended by the guideline of the Japanese Society of Sexually Transmitted Infections (JSSTI), was 100 %. The susceptibility rates of the strains to penicillin G and ciprofloxacin were lower than those in previous reports. Mosaic PBP 2 structures were detected in 51.9 % of the strains and the MICs of the strains with the mosaic PBP 2 to cefixime were much higher than those of the strains without the mosaic PBP 2. In the clinical situation, the treatment regimen recommended by the JSSTI remains appropriate; however, the susceptibility to cephalosporins should be intensively surveyed because strains with mosaic PBP 2 were commonly detected.
