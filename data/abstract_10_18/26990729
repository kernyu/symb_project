Wild animal populations in contact with antimicrobials and antimicrobial resistant bacteria that are daily released into the environment are able to become unintentional hosts of these resistant microorganisms. To clarify this issue, our study evaluated the presence of antibiotic resistance determinants on coagulase-negative staphylococci recovered from birds of prey and studied their genetic relatedness by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The unusual vga(A) and erm(T) genes, which confer resistance to clindamycin and erythromycin, respectively, were detected in Staphylococcus sciuri or Staphylococcus xylosus strains and the tet(K) gene in Staphylococcus kloosii. The PFGE patterns showed that three S. xylosus (isolated of Strix aluco and Otus scops) and two S. sciuri (recovered from Strix aluco and Milvus migrans) were clonally indistinguishable. These animals could be a source of unusual antimicrobial resistance determinants for highly used antibiotics in veterinary clinical practice.
