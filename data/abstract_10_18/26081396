OBJECTIVE: To assess the antibiotic resistance and molecular characterization of cholera strains and to provide basis for clinical treatment and prevention of cholera. METHODS: 4 stains isolated from an outbreak of cholera epidemic in Huai'an City in Jiangsu province in September 2010 were characterized using antibiotic susceptibility, biotype analysis, virluence genes detection, ctxB gene sequencing, and PFGE analysis. RESULTS: The 4 strains were all resistant to sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim, erythromycin, streptomycin. High drug susceptibility of the samples was found to 6 kinds of antibiotics such as amikacin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, ampicillin. The isolates expressed phenotypic traits of both serogroup O1 ogawa and El Tor and carried 9 kinds of virulence genes, ctxA, ace, zot, toxR, tcpI, ompU, rtxC, tcpA, and hlyA gene. They were also identified as harboring the classical ctxB genotype based on amino acid residue substitutions. The PFGE profiles of NotI showed a single banding pattern, while SfiI's was 2 banding patterns. CONCLUSION: The bacterium type of Vibrio cholerae causing the epidemic outbreak of cholera belonged to the atypical EL Tor variant which was also identified as toxicogenic strain. The mapping of the strains prompted that there should be the common contamination source. Drug sensitivity test can guide the clinical drug use, in order to reduce the emergence of resistant strains.
