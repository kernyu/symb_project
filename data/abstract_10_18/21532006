BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Enterococci are part of the normal flora of the gastrointestinal tract. They can cause enteric peritonitis, which is a serious complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD). However, the clinical course and outcome of PD-related Enterococcus peritonitis remains unclear. METHODS: We reviewed all Enterococcus peritonitis episodes occurring in our dialysis unit from 1995 to 2009. RESULTS: During the study period, 1421 episodes of peritonitis were recorded. Of 29 episodes (2.0%) that were attributable to single-organism Enterococcus, 12 episodes were caused by E. faecalis; 9, by E. faecium; and the remaining 8, by other Enterococcus species. The overall rate of ampicillin resistance was 41.4%. Recent use of antibiotics was associated with the development of ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus (ARE) peritonitis (hazard ratio: 12.53; p = 0.04). The primary response rate of Enterococcus peritonitis was significantly higher than that of Escherichia coli peritonitis (89.7% vs. 69.9%, p = 0.038), but the primary response rate was not significantly lower for ARE peritonitis than for ampicillin-susceptible Enterococcus (ASE) peritonitis (83.3% vs. 94.1%, p = 0.553). However, significantly more patients with ARE had received vancomycin (83.3% vs. 23.5%, p = 0.003), with a longer mean duration of vancomycin treatment (11.8 +/- 6.9 days vs. 3.7 +/- 6.8 days, p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Recent use of antibiotics was a risk factor for the development of ARE peritonitis. Outcomes in ASE and ARE peritonitis were similar, but vancomycin was required during treatment for ARE peritonitis, in turn possibly predisposing the patients to infections caused by vancomycin-resistant organisms.
