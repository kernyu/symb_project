BACKGROUND: The increasing emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis presents a threat to the effective control of tuberculosis (TB). Rapid detection of drug-resistance is more important than ever to address this scourge. The purpose of this study was to genotypically characterize the first-line antitubercular drug-resistant isolates collected over 11 years in Quebec. RESULTS: The main mutations found in our resistant strains collection (n = 225) include: the S315T substitution in katG (50.2 %), the -15 C/T mutation in the inhA promoter (29 %); the S531L substitution in rpoB (43 %); the deletion 8 bp 446 / + R140S in pncA (72.9 %); the M306I (35.7 %) and M306V (21.4 %) substitutions in embB. Ten of the mutations in katG and 4 mutations identified in pncA were previously undescribed. CONCLUSION: Screening of mutations conferring resistance to first-line antituberculous drugs using DNA-sequencing approach seems to be feasible and would drastically shorten the time to determine the resistance profile compared to the proportion method.
