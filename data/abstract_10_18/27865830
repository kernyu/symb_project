BACKGROUND: The recent molecular epidemiology of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli infection in two Korean community hospitals was evaluated in this prospective observational study. METHODS: We collected non-duplicated E. coli isolates from consecutive, sequentially encountered patients with community-onset episodes between March and April 2016 in two community hospitals in Gyeonggi-do province, Korea. We studied the prevalence, clinical characteristics and molecular epidemiology of E. coli sequence type 131 (ST131) isolated from the community. RESULTS: From a total of 213 E. coli isolates collected from the community, 94 (44.1%) were community-onset healthcare-associated isolates and 119 (55.9%) were community-associated isolates, of which urinary tract infection was the majority. A total of 55 (25.8%) of the 213 E. coli isolates were confirmed to have ESBL genes, which were mainly CTX-M types such as CTX-M-14 and CTX-M-15. There was no difference in the proportion of globally epidemic ST131 clones or that of O25, O16, H30, or H30Rx subclones between community-associated and community-onset healthcare-associated isolates. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, considerable ST131 E. coli isolations in the community were observed and about half of them were related to the history of a visit to the healthcare facilities, indicating the spread of multidrug-resistant E. coli to the community via healthcare facilities.
