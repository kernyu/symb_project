Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes nosocomial infections worldwide, with recent prevalence and higher frequency in wounded military personnel. Four A. baumannii strains from the Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) isolated between 2008 and 2009 were sequenced, representing diverse, multidrug-resistant isolates from osteomyelitis or septic patients.
