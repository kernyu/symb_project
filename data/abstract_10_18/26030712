Antibiotic-resistant mechanisms are associated with fitness costs. However, why antibiotic-resistant bacteria usually show increasing adaptation to hosts is largely unknown, especially from the host's perspective. The present study reveals the host's varied response to balofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli (BLFX-R) using an integrated proteome and metabolome approach and identifies myo-inositol and phagocytosis-related proteins as crucial biomarkers. Originally, macrophages have an optimal attractive preference to BLFX-S due to more polarization of BLFX-S than BLFX-R, which renders faster elimination to BLFX-S than BLFX-R. The slower elimination to BLFX-R may be reversed by exogenous myo-inositol. Primarily, myo-inositol depolarizes macrophages, elevating adherence to both BLFX-S and BLFX-R. Since the altered adherence is equal to both strains, the myo-inositol-treated macrophages are free of the barrier to BLFX-R and thereby promote phagocytosis of BLFX-R. This work provides a novel strategy based on metabolic modulation for eliminating antibiotic-resistant bacteria with a high degree of host adaptation.
