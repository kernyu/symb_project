Trueperella pyogenes, recently reclassified from the genus Arcanobacterium, is considered the causative agent of acute suppurative mastitis called summer mastitis. T. pyogenes produces a variety of known and putative virulence factors that include pyolysin and factors promoting adhesion to host cells. The objective of this study was to report the presence of virulence genes in T. pyogenes isolates that were identified as etiological agents of clinical mastitis in cows, as well as to determine antimicrobial resistance and distribution of selected determinants that can be associated with phenotypic resistance among these isolates. The presence of genes (plo, nanH, nanP, cbpA, fimA, fimC, fimE, fimG, tet(W), erm(X), erm(B)) was examined by conventional PCRs. Resistance to 10 antimicrobial agents was determined by the broth microdilution method. Among T. pyogenes isolates of bovine mastitis origin the genes encoding all virulence factors occurred. Besides pyolysin gene plo, the fimA was the only gene detected in all isolates, whereas other virulence factor genes were found with different frequencies. Phenotypic antimicrobial resistance was observed to tetracycline (85.5% isolates) and erythromycin (9.1%). Isolates non-susceptible to erythromycin simultaneously exhibited increased MIC of pirlimycin. Beta-lactams were active against isolates. We found the correlation between the presence of tetracycline and macrolide resistance genes and corresponding resistance phenotype. Genotypic characterization of a large number of T. pyogenes isolates from different herds performed in this study may be useful in explanation, which virulence factors play a significant role in the establishment of bovine mammary gland infection.
