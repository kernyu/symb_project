Molecular characterization of the drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains with different origins can generate information that is useful for developing molecular methods. These methods are widely applicable for rapid detection of drug resistance. A total of 166 rifampin (RIF)- and/or isoniazid (INH)-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis have been isolated from different parts of Vietnam; they were screened for mutations associated with resistance to these drugs by sequence analysis investigating genetic mutations associated with RIF and INH resistance. Seventeen different mutations were identified in 74 RIF-resistant strains, 56 of which (approximately 76%) had mutations in the so-called 81-bp "hot-spot" region of the rpoB gene. The most common point mutations were in codons 531 (37.8%), 526 (23%), and 516 (9.46%) of the rpoB gene. Mutations were not found in three strains (4.05%). In the case of INH resistance, five different mutations in the katG genes of 82 resistant strains were detected, among which the nucleotide substitution at codon 315 (76.83%) is the most common mutation. This study provided the first molecular characterization of INH and RIF resistance of M. tuberculosis strains from Vietnam, and detection of the katG and rpoB mutations of the INH and RIF-resistant strains should be useful for rapid detection of the INH- and RIF-resistant strains by molecular tests.
