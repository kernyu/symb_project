Occurrence of carbapenemase-producing organisms, including New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) is increasingly reported worldwide. The aim of this study was to assess the distribution of carbapenemase producers among multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria isolated from blood cultures. All carbapenem-resistant strains collected from December 2011 to December 2012 were analyzed. Presence of carbapenemases was assessed with combined disc test and Carba NP test followed by polymerase chain reaction for carbapenemase genes. Altogether, 30 strains were detected, of which 7 were positive for VIM (23.3%), 6 for NDM-1 (20%), 5 for IMP (16.7%), and KPC was present in one isolate (3.3%). Four Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were found to produce more than one carbapenemase. We also present the case report of a patient with Acinetobacter baumannii ventilator-associated pneumonia, followed by sepsis due to Enterococcus faecalis and pan-resistant NDM-1-producing P. aeruginosa. Despite the inappropriate therapy, the patient was successfully treated. This is the first report of NDM-1-producing strains in Slovakia and it contributes to a number of studies mapping the distribution of carbapenemase producers in Europe.
