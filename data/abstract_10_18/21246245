Edwardsiella tarda, a catalase-positive bacillus widely distributed throughout nature, is generally susceptible to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. We describe osteomyelitis due to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant E. tarda in a patient with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). Once E. tarda acquires antibiotic resistance, infected CGD patients may develop severe infections with unforeseeable consequences.
