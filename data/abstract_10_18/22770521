Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder associated with multispecies infections where interactions between classical and newly identified bacteria might be crucial to understanding the persistent colonisation in CF lungs. This study investigated the interactions between two emerging species, Inquilinus limosus and Dolosigranulum pigrum, and the conventional CF pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa by evaluating the ability to develop biofilms of mixed populations and then studying their susceptibility patterns to eight different antimicrobials. Monospecies biofilms formed by I. limosus and D. pigrum produced significantly less biomass than P. aeruginosa and displayed greater sensitivity to antimicrobials. However, when in dual-species biofilms with P. aeruginosa, the emerging species I. limosus and D. pigrum were crucial in increasing tolerance of the overall consortia to most antibiotics, even without a change in the number of biofilm-encased cells. These results may suggest that revising these and other species interactions in CF might enable the development of more suitable and effective therapies in the future.
