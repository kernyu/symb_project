BACKGROUND: Bedaquiline is a new antibiotic that was approved for the treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis. We aimed to evaluate the short-term microbiological efficacy and the tolerability profile of bedaquiline. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study among patients with MDR tuberculosis receiving bedaquiline for compassionate use between January 2010 and July 2013 and evaluated at 6 months of bedaquiline treatment. RESULTS: A total of 35 patients with MDR tuberculosis were included in the study. Nineteen (54%) had extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis, and 14 (40%) had isolates resistant to fluoroquinolones (Fqs) or second-line injectables. Bedaquiline was associated with a median of 4 (range, 2-5) other drugs, including linezolid in 33 (94%) cases. At 6 months of bedaquiline treatment, culture conversion was achieved in 28 of 29 (97%) cases with culture-positive pulmonary tuberculosis at bedaquiline initiation. Median time to culture conversion was 85 days (range, 8-235 days). Variables independently associated with culture conversion were treatment with a Fq (P = .01), absence of lung cavities (P < .001), and absence of hepatitis C virus infection (P = .001). A total of 7 patients (20%) experienced a >/=60-ms increase in QT interval, leading to bedaquiline discontinuation in 2 (6%) cases. Severe liver enzyme elevation occurred in 2 patients (6%). During the study period, 1 death (3%) occurred and was reported as unrelated to tuberculosis or antituberculosis treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The use of bedaquiline combined with other active drugs has the potential to achieve high culture conversion rates in complicated MDR and XDR tuberculosis cases, with a reassuring safety profile at 6 months of treatment.
