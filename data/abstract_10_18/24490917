Salmonella is commonly isolated from raw pork and is a leading cause of foodborne illness. Because China has the highest rate of pork consumption and the largest number of pig breeding facilities in the world, an epidemiological analysis of Salmonella species from pork in China is warranted. In this study, pork samples (n = 1,096) were collected from 20 major free markets in four cities of Jiangsu province from August 2010 to December 2012. A total of 163 Salmonella isolates were recovered from 154 Salmonella-positive samples. Among 14 Salmonella serovars identified, Derby (47.9%) was most prevalent, followed by Typhimurium (10.4%), Meleagridis (9.2%), Anatum (8.6%), and London (6.7%). Antimicrobial sensitivity testing revealed that 134 (82.2%) of the isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent, and 41 (25.2%) were resistant to more than three antimicrobials. The highest resistance was to tetracycline (66.3% of isolates) followed by ampicillin (39.9%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (31.3%), and nalidixic acid (30.1%). Multilocus sequence typing analysis revealed 14 sequence type (ST) patterns; ST40 was the most common (77 isolates) followed by ST64 (19 isolates). Our research revealed a high prevalence of Salmonella in retail pork. Diversity among the Salmonella isolates was high in terms of serovar and genotype, and multidrug resistance was prevalent. Multilocus sequence type was generally associated with serovar and provided a reliable prediction of the most common Salmonella serovars.
