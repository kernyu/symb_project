Hepatitis B Virus is the most common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. Currently approved agents of chronic HBV infection treatment include interferon and nucleoside analogues. However, the side effects of interferon and the viral resistance of nucleoside analogues make the current treatment far from satisfactory. Therefore, new drugs with novel structures and mechanisms are needed. Recently, a number of non-nucleoside HBV inhibitors have been obtained from natural sources or prepared by synthesis/semi-synthesis. Some of them exhibited potent anti-HBV activity with novel mechanisms. These compounds provide useful information for the medicinal chemist to develop novel non-nucleoside compounds as anti-HBV agents.
