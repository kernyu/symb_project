Mutation in HIV-1 pol gene confers the resistance to antiretroviral drugs. Three nucleotide sequences of HIV-1 pol gene products were selected and HIV BLAST was performed. Amino acid positions of 30 sequences were compared with HXB2 reference strain. Two sequences of protease show the major mutation with mutations sites of I54V and V82A and 8 sequences shown other mutations. One sequence of integrase with minor mutation of E157Q and 9 sequences with other mutations were inferred. This study is useful in making more accurate prediction of results with better combination Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) and important mutations.
