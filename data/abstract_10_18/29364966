Emerging drug-resistance and drug-associated toxicities are two major factors limiting successful cancer therapy. Combinations of chemotherapeutic drugs have been used in the clinic to improve patient outcome. However, cancer cells can acquire resistance to drugs, alone or in combination. Resistant tumors can also exhibit cross-resistance to other chemotherapeutic agents, resulting in sub-optimal treatment and/or treatment failure. Therefore, developing novel oncology drugs that induce no or little acquired resistance and with a favorable safety profile is essential. We show here that combining COTI-2, a novel clinical stage agent, with multiple chemotherapeutic and targeted agents enhances the activity of these drugs in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, no overt toxicity was observed in the combination treatment groups in vivo. Furthermore, unlike the tested chemotherapeutic drugs, cancer cells did not develop resistance to COTI-2. Finally, some chemo-resistant tumor cell lines only showed mild cross-resistance to COTI-2 while most remained sensitive to it.
