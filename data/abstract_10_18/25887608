PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There has been a reduction in overall under fives mortality (UFM) but neonatal mortality has not fallen at the same rate as for older children. Bacterial meningitis remains a common, often unrecognized and devastating illness in many African newborns with high mortality and morbidity. Further progress in reducing UFM has to focus on quality of care for neonates. Recent efforts to improve diagnosis, treatment and outcome are reviewed. RECENT FINDINGS: Diagnosis is often unsupported by laboratory tests and efforts have been made to improve the clinical diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. Simpler, robust bedside tests are being devised. The cause of bacterial meningitis is changing and first-line antimicrobial therapy and adjuvant therapies are evaluated. Programmes to reduce risk factors and prevent neonatal infections are identified. SUMMARY: Neonatal care needs to improve in first referral hospitals with simple, low-cost, validated measures provided as bundles of care for both mother and child. First-line antibiotic therapy must be reconsidered in the light of increased infections by multiresistant and Gram-negative bacteria. Studies are needed for effective and safe lengths of antimicrobial therapy, the role of adjuvant therapy and the best anticonvulsants to use.
