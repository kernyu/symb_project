Carbapenem- and fluoroquinolone-non-susceptible Acinetobacter baumannii were obtained from four nosocomial pneumonia patients who were clinically cured following combination therapy with doripenem/levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. In vitro synergy of doripenem/levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin was evaluated using time-kill analysis. In vivo synergy was tested using a mouse lethal infection model. In time-kill studies, doripenem and levofloxacin were both bactericidal when tested at Cmax; at (1/2)Cmax, the combination showed synergy up to 8 hours. Ciprofloxacin, alone or combined with doripenem, was not bactericidal. For mouse septicemia, doripenem (100 mg/kg) was >/=90% effective in preventing death in all four isolates. Levofloxacin (200 mg/kg) was 73% effective, and ciprofloxacin (35 mg/kg) was ineffective in preventing death. At lower drug concentrations, increased efficacy was observed for doripenem/levofloxacin, but not for doripenem/ciprofloxacin. Overall, the results suggest that a doripenem/levofloxacin combination may have clinical utility in treating some non-susceptible A. baumannii infections.
