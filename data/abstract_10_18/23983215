We examined the rate, clinical impact, and risk factors of cytomegalovirus (CMV) drug resistance in 561 patients who underwent 616 hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (HSCTs) over 5 years. Drug resistance was exclusively identified in haploidentical (haplo)-HSCT recipients receiving preemptive therapy, among whom the rate was 14.5%. Resistance appeared after prolonged treatment (median, 70 days), was associated with higher preceding viral load (P < .001), and was the strongest predictor for disease by multivariate analysis. The high rate of drug resistance as interlinked with severe disease in haplo-HSCT recipients suggests the potential advantage of prophylactic over preemptive treatment in high-risk patients and highlights the need for better-tolerable anti-CMV drugs.
