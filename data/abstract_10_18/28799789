AIM: Naphtho[1,2-b]furan-4,5-dione (N12D) and naphtho[2,3-b]furan-4,9-dione (N23D) are furanonaphthoquinone derivatives from natural resources. We examined the antimicrobial activity of N12D and N23D against drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. MATERIALS & METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentration, minimum bactericidal concentration, bacterial viability and agar diffusion assay were conducted against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and clinical isolates of vancomycin-resistant S. aureus. RESULTS & CONCLUSION: The minimum inhibitory concentration of N12D and N23D against MRSA was 4.9-9.8 and 39 muM, respectively. With regard to the agar diffusion test, the inhibition zone of the quinone compounds was threefold larger than that of oxacillin. N12D was found to inhibit MRSA biofilm thickness from 24 to 16 mum as observed by confocal microscopy. N12D showed a significant reduction of the intracellular MRSA burden without decreasing the macrophage viability. The antibacterial mechanisms of N12D may be bacterial wall/membrane damage and disturbance of gluconeogenesis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle.
