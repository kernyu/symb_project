Two mutants of Escherichia coli (V1 and V2) with acquired mechanisms of resistance to fluoroquinolones were isolated sequentially from blood cultures of a patient with cholangiocarcinoma treated repeatedly with ofloxacin; a third mutant (V3) was isolated under ciprofloxacin therapy. All mutants were related clonally. V1 was susceptible to quinolones but with diminished susceptibility to ofloxacin. V2 was hypersusceptible to nalidixic acid but had high-level resistance to ofloxacin. V3 was resistant to all quinolones. Ofloxacin selected for original gyrA and parC mutations, leading to the unusual and misleading resistance phenotypes of V1 and V2, whereas efflux played a major role in the increased resistance of V3.
