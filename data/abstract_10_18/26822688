Disequilibrium in the human debilitated immune system favors proliferation of invasive Candida species, a major therapeutic challenge due to development of resistance to several conventional antifungal agents (CAA) worldwide. Multiple mutations observed at specific loci that are targets for CAA are recognized as sources of drug resistance. This has prompted a shift from CAA, to diverse combination therapies, photodynamic and short peptide therapies capable of triggering specific apoptotic reactions within candidal cells. In this review, new designs and combination of short peptide (SP) with CAA as well as current application of photodynamic inactivation (PDI) against Candida species geared at generating reactive species of oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS) are discussed. It is observed that oxidative and nitrosative stresses provides a superior broad candidacidal effects for eradication of drug-resistant Candida species. The mechanism and limitations in these strategic approaches over CAA is also discussed.
