All the 31 isolates of Alloscardovia omnicolens exhibited low MICs for beta-lactams, glycopeptides, linezolid, tetracyclines, and cotrimoxazole. One strain showed MICs >/=256mug/mL for both erythromycin and clindamycin with a single point mutation in 23S rRNA. One strain likely had acquired fluoroquinolone resistance associated with a unique mutation in ParC.
