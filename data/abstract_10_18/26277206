INTRODUCTION: The increase in microorganisms showing patterns of multi-drug resistance or even pan-drug resistance is of growing concern. Fosfomycin (FO) is well known to be active against a wide variety of microorganisms, including highly resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), and can also synergistically act with other molecules. METHODS: This study examines the in vitro activity shown by FO against 120 strains of carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa using an agar dilution and a gradient diffusion test. Possible synergistic effects of the combinations of FO/amikacin and FO/ciprofloxacin were also examined using E-test and time-kill techniques. RESULTS: According to the epidemiological cut-off value (ECOFF) issued by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST), our results indicate that over three-quarters of the strains tested would be susceptible to FO treatment, especially if combined with another antimicrobial. The FO/ciprofloxacin combination had a synergistic effect on 40% of the clinical isolates, while for FO/amikacin this effect was only observed in 12% of the isolates. CONCLUSION: The appearance of carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa strains requires the evaluation by combination therapy. This report suggests that the FO/ciprofloxacin combination can be useful, showing a synergistic effect in 40% of the isolates.
