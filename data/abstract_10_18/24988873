OBJECTIVE: The eradication rate of 10-day sequential therapy for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection was not satisfactory in Korea, probably due to antibiotic resistance. To compare the treatment efficacy of 15-day and 10-day sequential therapy of conventional 7-day proton pump inhibitor (PPI) triple therapy for the treatment of H. pylori infection. METHODS: A total of 332 patients with H. pylori infection were randomly assigned to receive either 7-day PPI triple therapy, 10-day sequential therapy or 15-day sequential therapy. Eradication rate, drug compliance, and adverse events were compared among the three regimens. RESULTS: The eradication rates by intention-to-treat analysis were 64.3% (95% CI: 55.5-73.2; 74 of 115 patients), 72.1% (95% CI: 63.6-80.5; 80 of 111 patients), and 80.2% (95% CI: 72.5-87.9; 85 of 106 patients) in the 7-day PPI triple, 10-day and 15-day sequential therapy groups, respectively (p = 0.032). The eradication rates by per-protocol analysis were 68.5% (95% CI: 59.6-77.4; 74 of 108 patients), 78.4% (95% CI: 70.3-86.5; 80 of 102 patients), and 89.5% (95% CI: 83.2-95.8; 85 of 95 patients) in the 7-day PPI triple, 10-day and 15-day sequential therapy groups, respectively (p = 0.001). There were no statistically significant differences between the three eradication therapy groups in regard to drug compliance and adverse events. CONCLUSION: The 15-day sequential therapy demonstrated improved eradication efficacy compared with 7-day PPI triple and 10-day sequential therapy in Korea.
