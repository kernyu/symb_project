We encountered 2 patients with pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex disease in whom resistance to clarithromycin (CAM) was confirmed after treatment with rifampicin, ethambutol, and CAM. We evaluated the disease course in both patients. The deterioration of radiological findings was preceded by the acquisition of resistance to CAM in both cases. When symptoms of pulmonary MAC disease exacerbate, and radiological findings deteriorate, we should reconsider the type of treatment after determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of CAM for culture positive MAC strains.
