BACKGROUND: Eradication of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) at a younger age is considered to be effective in preventing gastric cancer. This study assessed the characteristics of eradication therapy in young patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled 1073 patients with H. pylori infection between 2000 and 2013. The subjects were divided into three groups according to age into the young (</=30 years), middle-aged (31-50 years), and elder (>/=51 years) groups. We also examined 472 cases to investigate clinical eradication characteristics. RESULTS: The rate of clarithromycin (CAM) resistance was 57.9%, 34.5%, and 35.2% in the young, middle-aged, and elder group, respectively, in 2012-2013 and was significantly higher in the young group than in the elder group (p = .01). Metronidazole (MNZ) resistance was similar among the three groups at each time point. While CAM resistance rose over the study period, MNZ resistance was noted to have decreased of late. The overall initial eradication success rate was 91.9% (95% CI, 89.1-94.1) in our cohort. Eradication efficiency was comparable in the young, middle-aged, and elder group at 94.3% (95% CI, 87.4-97.5), 90.2% (95% CI, 82.9-94.6), and 91.8% (95% CI, 88.1-94.5) respectively. Side effects such as skin rash were observed in 14.8%, 3.9%, and 3.5% of the respective groups. There were significant differences in the incidence of side effects between the young group and other groups (p < .05, respectively). CONCLUSION: Since CAM resistance and the incidence of side effects are higher in young individuals, it is especially important to select eradication regimens based on testing for antimicrobial susceptibility.
