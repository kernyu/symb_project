Bone involvement of hydatid disease is uncommon but when encountered, it presents few unique pathological features. The pattern of tissue involvement is largely different from that of visceral hydatid cyst. We describe the case of a 47 year-old man from northern India, a case of systemic hydatidosis including the liver and the right lung, presenting with an abscess like lesion in the left gluteal region with pathological fractures of the left femur. Radiographs and CT-scan images showed extensive invasion of the left hemi-pelvis and left proximal femur. Debridement of the honeycombed ilium yielded hydatid fluid, numerous small cysts and necrotic material. Multiple large devitalized and sequestrated bone pieces were recovered from the bone cavity of the affected ilium. A histopathological study of the bone sequestrums revealed the unique pattern of bone invasion by the characteristic laminated multi-layered cyst walls into areas of least resistance. Bone sequestration has not often been described or demonstrated elaborately in published studies of the past. The bone defects formed after debridement of the ilium and proximal femur were filled with bone cement along with augmentation of the femur using intra-medullary nail. The surgical technique adopted in our case although was not expected to be curative owing to the multi-system disease; it did result in significant functional improvement in the patient.
