Automatic stop-orders (ASOs) have been utilized to discourage inappropriately prolonged antibiotic therapy. An ASO policy, which required reordering of antibiotics after 7 days of therapy, had been in place at our institution prior to 2002, but was revoked after instances of compromised patient care due to inadvertent and inappropriate interruption of antimicrobial treatment. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of revoking the ASO policy on the duration of antibiotic therapy, infection-related outcome (cure vs failure), relapsing infection, occurrence of resistant bacteria and superinfection in patients with nosocomial pneumonia. A retrospective chart review of adult patients (>/= 18 years old) admitted to Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre with nosocomial pneumonia requiring antibiotic therapy was conducted. Duration of antibiotic therapy, infection-related outcome (cure vs failure), rate of relapsing infection, resistant organisms and superinfection were determined for each cohort. Forty-six eligible adults with nosocomial pneumonia per cohort were included [corrected]. Duration of antibiotic therapy was not significantly different in the pre- (11.4 +/- 3.8 days) compared with the post-ASO revocation cohort (10.8 +/- 4.1 days; p=0.43). There were also no significant differences between the cohorts with regard to infection-related outcome (cure vs failure), relapsing infection, or the occurrence of resistant bacteria or superinfection (p>0.5). Revocation of the ASO policy for antibiotics at our institution was not associated with a longer duration of antibiotic therapy, or increased incidence of infection-related mortality, relapsing infection, resistant bacteria or superinfection for patients with nosocomial pneumonia.
