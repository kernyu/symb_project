The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of tigecycline in multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii pneumonia. We retrospectively evaluated the outcome of adult patients with culture proven MDR A. baumannii pneumonia treated with tigecycline between January 2009 and March 2011. The study comprised a total of 72 MDR A. baumannii pneumonia cases (44 men, mean age 65.9+/-15.0). Tigecycline was used for a mean duration of 10.7+/-4.8 days. Microbiological eradication was observed in 47 cases (65.3%). Overall mortality was 55.5% and was lower in cases with microbiological eradication vs others (15/47 32% vs 25/25 100%, p<0.0001). Mortality and microbiological eradication rates were not different with monotherapy vs combination therapy (p>0.05). Patients who died had lower albumin levels, higher APACHE-II scores and CRP levels. The microbiological eradication rate of tigecycline in MDR A. baumannii was considerable. However, eradication of A. baumannii did not result in favorable clinical outcomes in those patients with low albumin, higher APACHE-II scores and CRP levels.
