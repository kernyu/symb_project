PURPOSE: Antibiotic stewardship programs (ASP) optimize antibiotic usage and combat antibiotic resistance of bacteria. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of specific ASP interventions on antibiotic consumption in general pediatric wards. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study to compare a pre-intervention (Sept.-Dec. 2014) and post-intervention (Sept.-Dec. 2015) period. An ASP bundle was established including (1) infectious diseases (ID) ward rounds (prospective-audit-with-feedback), (2) ID consultation service, (3) internal guidelines on empiric antibiotic therapy. Medical records on four general pediatric wards were reviewed daily to analyze: (1) antibiotic consumption, (2) antibiotic dosage ranges according to local guidelines, and (3) guideline adherence for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). RESULTS: Antibiotic prescribing for 273 patients (pre-intervention) was compared to 263 patients (post-intervention). Antibiotic prescription rate did not change (30.6 vs. 30.5%). However, overall days-of-therapy and length-of-therapy decreased by 10.5 and 7.7%, respectively. Use of cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones decreased by 35.5 and 59.9%, whereas the use of penicillins increased by 15.0%. An increase in dosage accuracy was noted (78.8 vs. 97.6%) and guideline adherence for CAP improved from 39.5 to 93.5%. Between the two study periods, no adverse effects regarding length of hospital stay and in-hospital mortality were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that implementation of an ASP was associated with a profound improvement of rational antibiotic use and, therefore, patient safety. Considering the relatively short observation period, the long-term effects of our ASP bundle need to be further investigated.
