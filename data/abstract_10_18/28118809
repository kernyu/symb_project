Combination of isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RFP) causes liver injury frequently among tuberculosis patients. However, mechanisms of the hepatotoxicity are not entirely understood. Protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) accumulation, as an endogenous hepatotoxin, resulting from isoniazid and rifampicin co-therapy (INH/RFP) has been reported in PXR-humanized mice. Aminolevulinic acid synthase1 (ALAS1), ferrochelatase (FECH) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) play crucial roles in PPIX synthesis, metabolism and transport, respectively. Herein, this study focused on the role of INH/RFP in these processes. We observed PPIX accumulation in human hepatocytes (L-02) and mouse livers. FECH expression was initially found downregulated both in L-02 cells and mouse livers and expression levels of ALAS1 and BCRP were elevated in L-02 cells after INH/RFP treatment, indicating FECH inhibition and ALAS1 induction might confer a synergistic effect on PPIX accumulation. Additionally, our results revealed that curcumin alleviated INH/RFP-induced liver injury, declined PPIX levels and induced FECH expression in both L-02 cells and mice. In conclusion, our data provide a novel insight in the mechanism of INH/RFP-induced PPIX accumulation and evidence for understanding pathogenesis of INH/RFP-induced liver injury, and suggest that amelioration of PPIX accumulation might be involved in the protective effect of curcumin on INH/RFP-induced liver injury.
