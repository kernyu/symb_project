Currently the safe and responsible use of antibiotics is a world-wide concern as it promotes prevention of the increasing emergence of multiresistant bacterial strains. Considering that there is a noticeable decline of the available antibiotic pipeline able to combat emerging resistance in serious infection a major concern grows around the prosthetic joint infections once the available commercial antibiotic loaded polymethylmethacrylate bone cements (BC) are inadequate for local antibiotic treatment, especially against MRSA, the most commonly isolated and antibiotic-resistant pathogen in bone infections. In this paper a novel modified BC matrix loaded with minocycline is proposed. A renewed interest in this tetracycline arises due to its broad-spectrum of activity against the main organisms responsible for prosthetic joint infections, especially against MRSA. The modified BC matrices were evaluated concerning minocycline release profile, biomechanical properties, solid-state characterization, antimicrobial stability and biocompatibility under in vitro conditions. BC matrix loaded with 2.5% (w/wBC) of minocycline and 10.0% (w/wBC) of lactose presented the best properties since it completely released the loaded minocycline, maintained the mechanical properties and the antimicrobial activity against representative strains of orthopedic infections. In vitro biocompatibility was assessed for the elected matrix and neither minocycline nor lactose loading enhanced BC cytotoxicity.
