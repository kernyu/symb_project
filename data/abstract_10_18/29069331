Antimicrobial resistance challenge requests to be able to measure patient medication-adherence in outpatient setting, where more than 90% of antibiotics are prescribed. We take advantage of an original dataset where adherence to treatment has been measured through two alternative measurements: pills count and the Morisky scale. Considering the first measure as benchmark, we test the validity of each of the Morisky items and their composition in a synthetic scale. We show that the short-form version of the medication-adherence scale with three items has the best predictive properties in the domain of antibiotic treatments. Given its concision, this tool could even be used by clinicians to quickly assess patients' adherence and modify it in the course, when needed.
