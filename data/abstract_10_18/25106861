Mycobacterium abscessus is a significant pathogen in the cystic fibrosis patient population. PCR amplification and sequencing can provide accurate subspecies identification, and can predict macrolide susceptibility, which is becoming increasingly important for patient management. Molecular techniques for further typing of isolates provide tools for the ongoing investigations into the clinical impact of particular M. abscessus strains. Whole-genome sequencing is likely to be the only technique that provides sufficient resolution for investigating transmission events between patients.
