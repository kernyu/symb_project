Resistance-associated variants (RAVs) represent a challenge to the success of new HCV therapies. The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of naturally occurring NS5B RAVs in Brazilian direct acting antivirals (DAA)-naive patients infected with HCV genotype 1, or co-infected with HIV. Patient enrollment and sample collection were performed between 2011 and 2013. Using Sanger-based sequencing, 244 sequences were obtained. RAVs detected in HCV-1a sequences were V321A (1.6 %), M414V (1.3 %), A421V (21.4-23.7 %), A421G (1.3 %) and Y448H (1.3 %); and in HCV-1b sequences were L159F (16.1 %), C316N (7.1-16.3 %) and A421V (3.2-6.3 %). Understanding the real RAVs scenario in patients is fundamental to establishing the most effective therapeutic strategy and in minimizing the risks for their selection.
