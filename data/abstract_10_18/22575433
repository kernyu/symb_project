OBJECTIVE: Few articles have examined specific counseling tools used to increase antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence. We present communication tools used in the context of Project MOTIV8, a randomized clinical trial. METHODS: We developed, piloted, and evaluated pictorial images to communicate the importance of consistent dose timing and the concept of drug resistance. Electronic drug monitoring (EDM) review was also used to provide visual feedback and facilitate problem solving discussions. Adherence knowledge of all participants (n=204) was assessed at baseline and 48 weeks. Participant satisfaction with counseling was also assessed. RESULTS: Adherence knowledge did not differ at baseline, however, at 48 weeks, intervention participants demonstrated significantly increased knowledge compared to controls F(1, 172)=10.76, p=0.001 (12.4% increase among intervention participants and 1.8% decrease among controls). Counselors reported that the tools were well-received, and 80% of participants felt the counseling helped them adhere to their medications. CONCLUSIONS: Counseling tools were both positively received and effective in increasing ART adherence knowledge among a diverse population. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: While developed for research, these counseling tools can be implemented into clinical practice to help patients; particularly those with lower levels of education or limited abstract thinking skills to understand medical concepts related to ART adherence.
