This study assesses the epidemiology of invasive fungal infection (IFI) in Portuguese Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) and compares the effectiveness and safety of antifungal therapies. A survey concerning the period 2005-2010 was carried out in NICUs of Greater Lisbon. Among 10 473 admitted neonates, 44 cases were identified, 29 among extreme low birth weight neonates (65.9%). Cumulative incidence rate was 0.42% (95%CI 0.309-0.559). A central vascular catheter was present before IFI in all cases. Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis were the most frequent isolates. The initial antifungic was fluconazole in 22 cases and liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) in 18. Therapy was switched in 10 patients on fluconazole and 3 on L-AmB. Case fatality rate was 11.4% (95%CI 4.39-23.91). No serious adverse drugs reactions (SADRs) or clinical side effects were observed. The knowledge of the local epidemiology helps to identify adequate prophylactic and treatment strategies.
