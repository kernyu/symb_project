Infectious diseases and bacterial resistance are gaining importance in nursing homes. A few studies about antibiotic (AB) consumption in nursing homes (NHs) already exist. A national survey was performed by the European surveillance of antimicrobial consumption with the aim of gaining insight in NHs care to all European countries. This study shows that the surveillance of AB use is not organised in continuous for many countries and have shown that the prevalence of infections in French nursing homes was 4.8%. In France, there is no national data collection system of AB consumption for NHs. Data were obtained from a point prevalence survey conducted in 2012 in 80 NHs. In total, 1.366 residents were included and 48 residents were treated with antimicrobials (3.5%). Antimicrobials were most frequently prescribed for the treatment of respiratory (45.8%) and urinary tract infections (27.1%). For 4 prescriptions, the indication was not found. Consumption datas for 52 NHs were collected. The AB consumption mediane was 39 defined daily dose/1.000 PD (DDD/1.000 PD). The mediane of AB consumption for the region was 39.4 DDD/1.000 PD. Coamoxi-clav is the main AB consumed (39%) followed by amoxicillin with 30%.
