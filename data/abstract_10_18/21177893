Sepsis caused by fluoroquinolone-resistant Escherichia coli is a risk for patients undergoing an ultrasound-guided, transrectal prostate biopsy. A method incorporating selective broth and media was evaluated using rectal swabs obtained from 136 patients prior to a biopsy procedure. Fluoroquinolone-resistant organisms were isolated from 22% of the patients included in this study.
