Two "privileged fragments", caffeic acid and piperazine, were integrated into bevirimat producing new derivatives with improved activity against HIV-1/NL4-3 and NL4-3/V370A carrying the most prevalent bevirimat-resistant polymorphism. The activity of one of these, 18c, was increased by 3-fold against NL4-3 and 51-fold against NL4-3/V370A. Moreover, 18c is a maturation inhibitor with improved metabolic stability. Our study suggested that integration of privileged motifs into promising natural product skeletons is an effective strategy for discovering potent derivatives.
