A new Myroides species has been isolated from the urine of a patient with fever in spite of multiple antibiotic treatments who had undergone a radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer and percutaneous nephrostomies for hydronephrosis in the past. The isolate, Myroides injenensis M09-0166(T) (KCTC 23367(T)), showed a high level of resistance to multiple antibiotic agents. Here we provide the first report of the draft genome sequence of a novel species in the genus Myroides within the nonfermenting Gram-negative group.
