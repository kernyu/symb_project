BACKGROUND: In pancreatic surgery, preoperative biliary drainage (PBD) leads to bacteribilia. Whether positive bile duct cultures are associated with a higher postoperative morbidity might be related to the resistance of the species isolated from bile. STUDY: Intraoperative bile duct cultures were collected from all patients who underwent pancreatic surgery. Postoperative morbidity was analyzed according to the species and the resistance found on bile duct cultures. RESULTS: Fifty-five percent (166/301) of patients had PBD, while 45% (135/301) underwent primary operation. PBD was associated with a positive bile duct culture in 87% (144/166) versus 21% (28/135) in patients without PBD (p = 0.001) and polymicrobial infections in 53% (88/166) versus 6% (8/135) (p = 0.001). Postoperative morbidity was 40% (121/301); mortality was 3% (9/301). PBD was not associated with morbidity and mortality, but resistant species on bile duct cultures lead to significantly more postoperative complications, 54% (25/46) versus 38% (96/255) (p = 0.033), with significantly more antibiotic therapies. CONCLUSION: PBD is associated with polymicrobial infections with resistant microorganisms, resulting in more postoperative complications. Since PBD cannot always be avoided, surgeons and gastroenterologists must be aware of their institutional surveillance data to identify patients at risk for postoperative complications.
