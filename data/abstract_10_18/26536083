BACKGROUND/AIMS: Hemodialysis (HD) patients often show impaired response to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Extended HD membrane permeability may potentially improve ESA response. METHODS: Twenty-four prevalent HD patients were randomly assigned to 12 weeks use of high cut-off (HCO) membrane (in every second dialysis treatment) or continued treatment with high-flux membrane. We monitored changes in hemoglobin (Hb), ESA dose, and key biochemical markers. RESULTS: The Hb level increased in the study group (from 11.6 +/- 1.0 to 12.5 +/- 1.5 g/dl; p = 0.038) but was stable in the control group. Variation over time in ESA dose and ESA resistance index did not differ between groups. HCO membrane usage for 12 weeks led to decreased hepcidin level, from 303 +/- 189 to 157 +/- 83 ng/ml (p = 0.024); serum albumin level decreased and stabilized 15 +/- 6% below baseline. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that use of a more permeable dialysis membrane may improve ESA responsiveness in iron-replete HD patients. Extensive albumin removal may preclude long-term use of the HCO membrane.
