We report a case of community-onset pyomyositis due to Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis in South Korea. The isolated strain was resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins and harbored sequence type 11 coproducing CTX-M-15 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). Physicians should be alert for early diagnosis and appropriate treatment since ESBL-producing nontyphoidal Salmonella infections are difficult to treat without initiation of appropriate empirical antibiotics.
