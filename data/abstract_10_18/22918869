We screened 21 extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae with reduced susceptibility to carbapenems for carbapenemase production. Five strains (four Klebsiella pneumoniae and one Citrobacter freundii) showed carbapenemase production, which was identified as OXA-48. The bla(OXA-48) gene was detected on ~54 kb plasmids belonging to IncA/C in one case. Two isolates harboured IS1999, which is involved in bla(OXA-48) mobilization. Carbapenem resistance in enterobacteria should be regarded as an emerging clinical problem in our hospital and necessitates rigorous surveillance in order to limit its spread.
