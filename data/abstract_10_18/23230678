OBJECTIVE: To reviewe the research progress of liposomes as antibiotic carriers. METHODS: Domestic and abroad literature concerning liposomes as antibiotic carriers was reviewed and analyzed thoroughly. RESULTS: Liposomes as antibiotic carriers can significantly improve drug distribution, enhance antibacterial activity, and reduce the side effects of antibiotics during treatment. But it also has some problems, such as poor physical and chemical stabilities and low encapsulation efficiency. CONCLUSION: Liposomes as antibiotic carriers can reduce the drug toxicity, improve drug biodistribution, and pharmacokinetics, and bring the dawn to completely curing infections disease.
