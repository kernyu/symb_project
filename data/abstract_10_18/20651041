To obtain the genotype and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of Campylobacter jejuni isolates from north China, 93 C. jejuni isolates (56 isolates from patients with diarrhoea, 7 isolates from Guillain-Barre syndrome patients and 30 isolates from chicken stools) were selected for multilocus sequence typing (MLST), PFGE and drug resistance testing. A total of 49 sequence types (STs) were identified from the entire panel of 93 C. jejuni isolates. Fifty-six isolates belonged to 14 clonal complexes, while 37 isolates could not be assigned to any known clonal complex. The most frequently observed clonal complexes were ST-21 (11 isolates), ST-353 (10 isolates) and ST-443 (6 isolates). Fifty-three PFGE SmaI patterns were identified among 93 isolates. No erythromycin-, gentamicin- or streptomycin-resistant isolates were found among the 44 strains isolated in 2008. Resistance to nalidixic acid, levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin was observed in 100 % (44/44) of the tested isolates. This study has shown the genetic characteristics of C. jejuni isolates in north China. In addition, overlapping clonal groups were defined by both MLST and PFGE for C. jejuni human and chicken isolates.
