Although numerous studies have documented outbreaks of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) possessing various carbapenemases, reports on outbreaks due to CRKP possessing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and/or AmpCs with porin lesions have been limited. Here, we describe an outbreak caused by an ertapenem-resistant, CTX-M-15-producing clonal K. pneumoniae strain expressing an OmpK36 porin variant. From May 2012 to November 2012, 37 ertapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates phenotypically negative for carbapenemase production were recovered from 19 patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit of a Greek hospital. The isolates were either susceptible or intermediate to other carbapenems and resistant to all remaining beta-lactams but cefotetan. Phenotypic and molecular analysis revealed the presence in all isolates of the blaCTX-M-15 gene on a conjugative 100-kb plasmid, disruption in the expression of the ompK35 gene, and the production of an Ompk36 porin variant. The index case was a patient admitted from another hospital. Active surveillance upon admission and on a weekly basis was immediately initiated; environmental samples were also periodically tested. Molecular typing showed that all clinical isolates as well as two ertapenem-resistant environmental K. pneumoniae isolates belonged to the same clonal type and were assigned to multilocus sequence typing (MLST) sequence type 101 (ST101). As all colonized/infected patients were hospitalized during overlapping periods, cross-infection was considered the main route for the dissemination of the outbreak strain. Despite reinforcement of infection control measures and active surveillance, the outbreak lasted approximately 7 months. Identification of hidden carriers upon admission and by screening on a weekly basis was found valuable for early recognition and subsequent successful management of the outbreak.
