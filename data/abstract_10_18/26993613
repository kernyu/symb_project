Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) are a family of transcription factors that mediate the transcriptional regulation of interferon (IFN) genes and IFN-inducible genes. In this study, IRF-1 gene is cloned from the common carp, Cyprinus carpio L., named CcIRF-1. The full-length cDNA of CcIRF-1 is 1427 bp, including an open reading frame of 861 bp encoding a protein of 286 amino acids. The putative CcIRF-1 is characterized by a conserved DNA-binding domain and includes a signature of six conserved tryptophan residues. The genomic sequence of CcIRF-1 is described, which consists of 9 exons and 8 introns. The sequence analysis shows that CcIRF-1 is clustered into IRF-1 subfamily, and has the closest relationship with the zebrafish IRF-1. CcIRF-1 is found constitutively expressed in different organs of healthy common carp. The main findings are that CcIRF-1 is up-regulated following stimulation with poly(I:C) in all tested tissues. Moreover, the downstream gene of IRF-1 - IFN is found to be correlated with the up-regulation of IRF-1 after injection with poly(I:C). Furthermore, we also isolate the peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) and find that there is a relevance between the expression profile of CcIRF-1 and IFN in poly(I:C) stimulated PBLs.
