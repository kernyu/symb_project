BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Infection is the most important risk factor contributing to death in severe acute pancreatitis. Multidrug resistant (MDR) bacterial infections are an emerging problem in severe acute pancreatitis. METHODS: From January 2009 to December 2011 the medical records of 46 patients with infected severe acute pancreatitis were reviewed retrospectively to identify risk factors for the development of MDR bacterial infection and assess the related outcomes. RESULTS: The mean age of the 46 patients was 55 years; 38 were males. Thirty-six patients (78.3%) had necrotizing pancreatitis and all of enrolled 46 patients had suspected or proven pancreatic infection. MDR microorganisms was found in 29 (63%) of the 46 patients. A total of 51 episodes of MDR infection were collected from 11 cases of infected pancreatic pseudocysts, 36 cases of infected necrosis/infected walled-off necrosis and 4 cases of bacteremia. The most frequent MDR bacteria was methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (n = 15). Transferred patients had a higher incidence of MDR infections than primarily admitted patients (72% vs. 35%, P = .015). The mean intensive care unit stay was significantly longer in patients with MDR bacterial infections (20 vs. 2 days, P = .001). Mortality was not significantly different in the patients with MDR infections vs. those without it (14% vs. 6%, P = .411). CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware of the high incidence of MDR bacterial infections in patients with severe acute pancreatitis, especially referred patients. Empiric therapy directed at these pathogens may be used in patients where severe sepsis persists, until definitive culture results are obtained.
