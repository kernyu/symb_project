Drug resistance in equine gastro-intestinal parasitic nematodes has been reported throughout the world. While the focus is usually put on cyathostomins, observations of macrocylic lactone failure against Oxyuris equi have accumulated over the last decade. Here we report the failure of ivermectin in the control of O. equi in an experimental Welsh pony herd. In a first trial, 6 ponies previously drenched with moxidectin and showing patent O. equi infections were administered ivermectin and subsequently monitored for O. equi egg excretion over one month. This trial demonstrated a failure of ivermectin to control O. equi egg excretion as half of ponies demonstrated recurrent egg excretion in the peri-anal region during 21days after treatment. One year later, six female Welsh ponies drenched with moxidectin demonstrated signs of itching and scratching in their peri-anal region with worms being found transiently in fecal materials three weeks later. Ponies were allocated to three treatment groups, i.e. ivermectin, pyrantel embonate and fenbendazole and monitored for egg excretion over five weeks. Fenbendazole and pyrantel embonate broke ivermectin suboptimal efficacy as soon as 8 and 14days respectively after treatment, while egg excretion remained constant throughout the 41-day long trial in the ivermectin-treated ponies. This is the first report of ivermectin failure against O. equi in France. In the absence of critical efficacy test, it remains unclear whether true resistance is at stake or if these observations confound a constitutive suboptimal efficacy of ivermectin against O. equi.
