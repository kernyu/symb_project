Five series of (Z)-5-(4-(2-oxo-2-phenylethoxy)benzylidene)-2-thioxothiazolidin-4-one derivatives (I-V) were synthesized, characterized, and evaluated for their anti-bacterial activity. Most of the synthesized compounds showed potent inhibition against several Gram-positive bacteria (including multidrug-resistant clinical isolates) with MIC values in the range of 1-32 mug/mL. Compounds IIIi, Vb and Vc presented the most potent activity, showing four-fold more potency than norfloxacin (MIC = 8 mug/mL and 4 mug/mL) and 64-fold more activity than oxacillin (MIC > 64 mug/mL) against MRSA CCARM 3167 and 3506 strains with MIC values of 1 mug/mL, and 64-fold more potency than norfloxacin (MIC > 64 mug/mL) and comparable activity to oxacillin (MIC = 1 mug/mL) against the QRSA CCARM 3505 and 3519 strains. None of the compounds exhibited any activity against the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli 1356 at 64 mug/mL.
