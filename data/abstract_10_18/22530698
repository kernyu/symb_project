The goal of this paper was to establish the durability profile of antibacterial multilayer thin films under storage and usage conditions. Thin films were built on stainless steel (SS) by means of a layer-by-layer process alternating a negatively charged polyelectrolyte, polyacrylic acid, with a cationic antibacterial peptide, nisin. SS coupons coated with the antibacterial film were challenged under environmental and usage conditions likely to be encountered in real-world applications. The change in antibacterial activity elicited by the challenge was used as an indicator of multilayer film resistance. Antibacterial SS samples could be stored for several weeks at 4 degrees C in ambient air and antibacterial films were resistant to dipping and mild wiping in water and neutral detergent. The multilayer coating showed some weaknesses, however, that need to be addressed.
