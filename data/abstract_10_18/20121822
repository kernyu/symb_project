Quinolone and beta-lactam resistance mechanisms and clonal relationships were characterized among Escherichia coli isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin and extended-spectrum cephalosporins associated with human extra-intestinal infections in Rome. The E. coli. ST131 clone was found to be prevalent. This clone invariably carried a specific pattern of substitutions in the topoisomerase genes and all isolates but one produced CTX-M-15. One ST131 isolate produced SHV-12. The new ST131 variant described here is of particular concern because it combines fluoroquinolone resistance and chromosomally encoded CTX-M-15.
