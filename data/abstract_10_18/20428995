If empiric antibiotic treatment is not successful in a case of suspected pneumonia further investigations are required. We present a case where originally an intralobar, bronchopulmonary sequestration could clearly be diagnosed by a thoracic CT scan. A 3D reconstruction revealed the pathognomonic arterial supply from the thoracic aorta and the venous drainage via pulmonary vein to the left atrium. Therefore, elective resection of the sequestration was indicated.
