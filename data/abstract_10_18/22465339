Human herpes simplex virus infections are very common and represent significant morbidity in the immunocompromised host. Patients with acyclovir resistant strains of HSV based on viral thymidine kinase gene mutations need alternative therapeutic approaches. Leflunomide has been shown to possess antiviral activity against several viruses. Herein we describe a case of acyclovir resistant HSV-2 proctitis in an HIV patient successfully treated with leflunomide without significant side effects.
