Resistance of Escherichia coli to third-generation cephalosporin (3GC) in fecal samples representative of French egg production was studied. The susceptibility to cefotaxime of E. coli isolates obtained by culture on nonselective media was determined. Twenty-two nonsusceptible isolates were obtained (7.51%; 95% confidence interval, 4.49 to 10.54%), the majority of which came from young birds. Most isolates carried a blaCTX-M-1 group gene, and a few carried a blaCMY-2-like gene. Control of 3GC resistance in laying hens is needed.
