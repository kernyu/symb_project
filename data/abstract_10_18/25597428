This study was undertaken to investigate the ability of ten lactic acid bacterial strains to produce exopolysaccharides (EPS) on MRS broth containing 4% sucrose. A maximum EPS production yield of 2.4 g/l was obtained by strain Lactobacillus sp. Ca6. The results from thin layer chromatography (TLC) and high performance chromatography (HPLC) analyses showed that the EPS produced was a polymer of glucose. Further FTIR spectroscopic analysis revealed the presence of carboxyl, hydroxyl and amide groups corresponding to a typical EPS. In addition to EPS production, Lactobacillus sp. Ca6 displayed good probiotic properties (antimicrobial activities and sensitivity to several antibiotics) and resistance to acidic condition (pH 2) and 5% bile bovine. Overall, the findings indicate that this strain has a number of promising properties that make it a potential promising candidate for future application as a food additive.
