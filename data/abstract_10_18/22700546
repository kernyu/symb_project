One highly multi-drug-resistant, mucus-producing and foul-smelling strain of Klebsiella ozaenae was isolated from a patient in the ICU of a Chinese tertiary hospital. MICs of several clinical antimicrobials against the strain were obtained using the Vitek-2 Compact System with AST-GN13 cards and resistance genes were evaluated by PCR and gene sequencing. The strain was resistant to most of the beta-lactams and quinolones tested and carried several antibiotic resistance genes, including bla(KPC-2), bla(TEM-98), bla(CTX-M-3), bla(SHV-26) and qnrS. To our knowledge, this is the first report of beta-lactam and quinolone resistance genes co-existing in a K. ozaenae strain in China.
