BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious public health problem in developing countries such as Pakistan. Rapid diagnosis of TB and detection of drug resistance are very important for timely and appropriate management of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the diagnostic efficacy of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay for rapid diagnosis of TB and detection of rifampicin (RIF) resistance in extrapulmonary and smear-negative pulmonary TB suspects. METHODS: A total of 98 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and 168 extrapulmonary specimens were processed by Xpert MTB/RIF. Culture results are considered as the gold standard for diagnosis of TB, and drug susceptibility testing for detection of RIF resistance. Diagnostic efficacy was measured in terms of sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values. RESULTS: The Xpert MTB/RIF assay detected 40 (40.8 %) of 98 BALF of presumptive pulmonary TB and 60 (35.7 %) of 168 extrapulmonary specimens. Sensitivity and specificity of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay for detection of TB was 86 and 88.4 %, respectively. The positive predictive value was 71.5 % while negative predictive value was 95.1 %. CONCLUSION: The Xpert MTB/RIF assay is a rapid and simple technique with high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing TB and detecting drug resistance in extrapulmonary and smear-negative TB cases.
