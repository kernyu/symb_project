Ion Torrent next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology was applied to study the mode of emergence of acyclovir (ACV)-resistant (ACVr) herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in patients with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) by quantitatively detecting mutations in the viral thymidine kinase (vTK) gene in the HSV-1 isolates recovered from HSCT patients. All of the mutations detected with the Sanger sequencing method in the vTK genes of HSV-1 isolates were also detected with the NGS assay. Furthermore, different mutations, which conferred ACV resistance and were not detected with the Sanger sequencing method, were also detected in a quantitative manner by using the NGS assay. The approach described here is applicable to studying the emergence process of vTK gene mutation-associated ACVr HSV-1 more in detail than the Sanger method. The NGS assay makes it possible to make a diagnosis of vTK gene mutation-associated ACVr HSV-1 infections at the early stage, which the ratio of ACVr HSV-1 is much lower than that of ACV-sensitive (ACVs) HSV-1.
