PURPOSE: To evaluate demographic, clinical, and microbiological profile of eye donors and efficacy of 0.3% gatifloxacin hydrochloride in microbial decontamination of donor corneas. METHODS: About 513 donors and 1,026 corneas received at National Eye Bank of a tertiary care hospital during 1-year period were analyzed prospectively in this randomized clinical trial. The donor eyes were graded and treated with 5% povidone-iodine, 0.4% amikacin sulphate, and 0.3% gatifloxacin hydrochloride. The parameters evaluated were death enucleation time (DET), grading of donor corneas, microbiological profile of culture organisms, and their sensitivity to various antibiotics. RESULTS: Mean DET was 6.29+/-5.7 hours. Forty one percent eyes were optical grade corneas and the majority of donors (38.5%) had accidental deaths. Good grade eyes were maximum with DET of <1 hour and were comparable between 0-6 hours and 6-12 hours. About 57.6% (591/1026) eyes were culture positive; most common organisms were Pseudomonas spp (53%) and Coagulase-negative Staphylococci (24%). Culture positivity reduced significantly after treatment with povidone iodine and amikacin (P=0.002, right eye; P=0.004; left eye) and decreased further with use of gatifloxacin (P=0.001). Pseudomonas (93%), Coagulase-negative Staphylococci (96.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (90.5%), enterococci and gram-negative bacilli were sensitive to gatifloxacin. Pseudomonas spp which were multidrug-resistant were sensitive to polymyxin-B. CONCLUSIONS: Gatifloxacin hydrochloride in addition to amikacin sulphate is beneficial for donor eye decontamination. Polymyxin-B may be used for multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas spp.
