The objective of this study was to explore independent risk factors for the isolation of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a Japanese university hospital between January 1997 and December 2010. MDR P. aeruginosa was defined when the organism was resistant or intermediately susceptible to all five antimicrobials tested. In all, 159 patients with MDR P. aeruginosa were identified over the 14-year period. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that prolonged hospital stay, prior exposure to meropenem and fluoroquinolones, and patients suffering from diabetes mellitus or receiving surgery were predictive risk factors for the isolation of MDR P. aeruginosa.
