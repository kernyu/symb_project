OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of bacteraemia in patients with chronic kidney disease, particularly those on dialysis and those who had had renal transplant, and to evaluate resistance among the isolated strains. METHODS: The cross-sectional study was conducted at Kidney Centre, Al-Sayyed Hospital, Rawalpindi, Pakistan, from June to December 2014. Samples that displayed positive growth were separated from the rest. The isolates were then identified and screened for extended spectrum beta lactamases and metallo beta lactamases production and other resistance mechanisms by phenotypic method. RESULTS: Of the 1400 samples, only 46 samples (3.3%) displayed signal for positive growth. The prevalence of extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) producing strains was recorded to be 37%.Carbapenem resistance was witnessed in 15% samples. Whereas, Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus prevalence was detected to be 2%. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance in gram-negative microbes was rising, while it was declining in gram-positive microbes.
