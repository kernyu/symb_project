Since the first description of Wohlfahrtiimonas chitiniclastica in 2008, a number of well described case reports demonstrating its pathogenic role in humans have been published. Infections may be closely linked to flies, such as Wohlfahrtia magnifica, Lucilia sericata, Chrysomya megacephala or Musca domestica. These insects are potent vectors for the distribution of W. chitiniclastica causing local or systemic infections originating from wounds infested with fly larvae. However, other potential sources of transmission of W. chitiniclastica have been described such as soil or chicken meat. Infections in humans reported to date comprise wound infections, cellulitis, osteomyelitis and sepsis. This review summarizes all the literature available up to now and gives the current knowledge about this emerging human pathogen. Additionally, four patients with proven W. chitiniclastica infections treated at Dresden University Hospital between 2013 and 2015, are included. Special focus was placed on microbiological identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of the pathogen.
