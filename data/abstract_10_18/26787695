In order to correlate the mutations inside the entiregyrAandgyrBgenes with the level of resistance to ofloxacin (OFX) and moxifloxacin (MFX) in isolates of multidrug-resistantMycobacterium tuberculosis(MDR-TB), a total of 111 isolates were categorized into OFX-susceptible (MIC, </=2 mug/ml) and low-level (MIC, 4 to 8 mug/ml) and high-level (MIC, >/=16 mug/ml) OFX-resistant isolates and MFX-susceptible (MIC, </=0.5 mug/ml) and low-level (MIC, 1 to 2 mug/ml) and high-level (MIC, >/=4 mug/ml) MFX-resistant isolates. Resistance-associated mutations inside thegyrAgene were found in 30.2% of OFX-susceptible and 72.5% and 72.2% of low-level and high-level OFX-resistant isolates and in 28.6% of MFX-susceptible and 58.1% and 83.9% of low-level and high-level MFX-resistant isolates. Compared with OFX-susceptible isolates, low-level and high-level OFX-resistant isolates had a significantly higher prevalence of mutations atgyrAcodons 88 to 94 (17.0%, 65.0%, and 72.2%, respectively;P< 0.001) and a higher prevalence of thegyrBG512R mutation (0.0%, 2.5%, and 16.7%, respectively;P= 0.006). Similarly, compared with MFX-susceptible isolates, low-level and high-level MFX-resistant isolates had a significantly higher prevalence of mutations atgyrAcodons 88 to 94 (14.3%, 51.6%, and 80.6%, respectively;P< 0.001) as well as a higher prevalence of thegyrBG512R mutation (0.0%, 0.0%, and 12.9%, respectively;P= 0.011). D94G and D94N mutations ingyrAand the G512R mutation ingyrBwere correlated with high-level MFX resistance, while the D94A mutation was associated with low-level MFX resistance. The prevalence of mutations atgyrAcodons 88 to 94 and thegyrBG512R mutation were higher among fluoroquinolone (FQ)-susceptible East Asian (Beijing) and Indo-Oceanic strains than they were among Euro-American strains, implying that molecular techniques to detect FQ resistance may be less specific in areas with a high prevalence of East Asian (Beijing) and Indo-Oceanic strains.
