Chemical inhibitors can help analyze dynamic cellular processes, particularly when probes are active in genetically tractable model systems. Although fission yeast has served as an important model system, which shares more cellular processes (e.g., RNAi) with humans than budding yeast, its use for chemical biology has been limited by its multidrug resistance (MDR) response. Using genomics and genetics approaches, we identified the key transcription factors and drug-efflux transporters responsible for fission yeast MDR and designed strains sensitive to a wide-range of chemical inhibitors, including commonly used probes. We used this strain, along with acute chemical inhibition and high-resolution imaging, to examine metaphase spindle organization in a "closed" mitosis. Together, our findings suggest that our fission yeast strains will allow the use of several inhibitors as probes, discovery of new inhibitors, and analysis of drug action.
