Objective: To understand the characteristics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) in epidemiology and distribution from Guangdong Province, and to explore the risk factors associated with drug resistance. Methods: A total of 225 clinical strains of MTB collected from 5 drug resistance monitoring sites of Guangdong Province in 2015 were tested by Regions of Difference 105 (RD105) deletion test and 15 loci mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units (MIRU) were used for genotyping. Gene clustering was analyzed using BioNumerics7.6. Drug susceptibility test was tested by proportion method. The statistical analysis used chi-square test and multivariate logistic regression. Results: There were 158 (70.2%) Beijing family strains from the 225 cases. Hunter-gaston index of MIRU loci varied from each other. The MTBs from Guangdong Province were categorized into 2 gene clusters by clustering analysis in which the rate of cluster of complexwas significantly higher than complex(chi(2) values were 9.331, P values were 0.020). It was found by multivariate logistic regression that Qub11b was associated with resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid (P values were 0.013, 0.012 respectively.), ETR F with resistance to isoniazid, streptomycin, ethambutol and ofloxacin (P values were 0.039, 0.040, 0.023 and 0.003 respectively), Mtub21 with resistance to capreomycin (P values were 0.040), and QUB26 with resistance to ethionamide (P values were 0.047). Conclusions: The genes of MTB from Guangdong Province were of polymorphisms and the distribution of strains were stable. QUB11b, ETR F, Mtub21 and QUB26 could be related to biomarkers for predicting drug resistance.
