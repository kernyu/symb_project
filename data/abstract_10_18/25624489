Diverse viruses encode regulatory RNAs called microRNAs (miRNAs). Despite much progress, the functions of the majority of viral miRNAs remain unknown. Most previous studies have used biochemical methods to uncover targets of viral miRNAs, but it is unclear what fraction of these targets is functionally important. Here, we apply an alternative strategy based on the premise that assorted viral miRNAs will share functionality. Screening a library of >70 human viral miRNAs showed that three unrelated miRNAs from distantly related herpesviruses significantly inhibited IFN signaling. Strikingly, each of these miRNAs directly reduced expression of the cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CBP), which as part of the p300-CBP complex, mediates IFN signaling. We show that both 5' and 3' derivatives from Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encoded miR-BART-18 precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) and the orthologous pre-miRNA from Rhesus lymphocryptovirus contribute to reducing IFN signaling. Thus, through both convergent and divergent evolutionary mechanisms, varied herpesviral miRNAs share the ability to decrease IFN signaling. Restoring miR-BART-18 to cells infected with an EBV miRNA mutant conveyed a cellular growth advantage upon IFN treatment, and relevant miRNAs from other herpesviruses were able to complement this activity. Blocking miR-BART-18 function in an EBV(+) tumor cell line renders cells more susceptible to IFN-mediated effects. These findings provide a mechanism that can at least partially explain the resistance of some EBV-associated tumors to IFN therapy. Our work suggests that similar pan-viral-miRNA functional-based screening strategies are warranted for determining relevant activities of other viral miRNAs.
