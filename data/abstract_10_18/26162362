BACKGROUND: Rapid but simple diagnostic tools for the detection of drug-resistant (DR) tuberculosis (TB) have been acknowledged as being important for its effective management and control. OBJECTIVE: To establish a molecular line-probe assay (GenoType MTBDRplus) for detecting DR-TB in Ghana. METHOD: We first screened 113 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates using the indirect proportion method and MTBDRplus. The rpoB and katG genes and the promoter regions of oxyR-ahpC and inhA were sequenced to identify mutations in isolates found to be resistant on phenotypic drug susceptibility testing and/or MTBDRplus. We then analysed an additional 412 isolates using only MTBDRplus. RESULTS: Respectively 43 (8.2%) and 8 (1.5%) isolates were resistant to isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RMP), while 8 (1.5%) were multidrug-resistant. In resistant isolates, mutations in codon 450 of rpoB and codon 315 of katG, conferring resistance to respectively RMP and INH, dominated. We found two RMP-resistant isolates with a S450L substitution, each harbouring an additional mutation at S388L and Q409R. Using phenotypic testing as gold standard, the MTBDRplus assay showed a sensitivity and specificity in the detection of RMP and INH resistance and multidrug resistance of respectively 100% and 100%, 83.3% and 100%, and 100% and 100%. CONCLUSION: The high sensitivity of MTBDRplus makes it a valuable addition to the conventional TB diagnostic algorithm in Ghana.
