The adoption of artemisinin-based combination therapy, together with other malaria control strategies, has played a significant role in reducing the burden of malaria in many endemic countries. The artemisinin-based combination therapy artemether-lumefantrine (AL; Coartem((R)), Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland) has demonstrated consistently high efficacy and safety for over a decade. Currently deployed as a first- or second-line treatment in most sub-Saharan African countries, its extensive use is endorsed by a lack of reported parasite resistance in Africa to date. With a focus on patient needs, AL offers a tailored formulation for infants and children, and packaging solutions to promote adherence. Working towards malaria elimination, innovative strategies using AL, such as treatment of asymptomatic carriers, will be of interest. AL has the potential to continue playing an important role in saving lives.
