Salmonella enterica is the leading cause of foodborne-related deaths and hospitalizations within the United States. Infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) strains are associated with higher hospital costs and case fatality. The objective for this study was to determine the association of management practices with the recovery of Salmonella and AMR Salmonella on dairy herds. Individual adult cow fecal samples and/or composite fecal samples were collected from 265 dairy herds in 17 states. Samples were cultured for Salmonella, and the MIC was determined for 15 antimicrobials. Herds were classified as Salmonella positive if at least one isolate was recovered, and AMR Salmonella positive if at least one resistant isolate was recovered. Questionnaires regarding management practices were administered to herd operators, and a subset of practices was selected based on subject knowledge and prior research. Data on preventive and therapeutic antimicrobial usage were included in the analysis. Logistic regression models were used to determine which practices were significantly (p<0.05) associated with each herd classification. A total of 124 and 25 herds were classified as Salmonella positive and AMR Salmonella positive, respectively. Variables significantly associated with Salmonella-positive herds included using sprinklers or misters for heat abatement (OR=2.8; CI: 1.6-4.9), feeding anionic salts to cows (OR=1.9; CI: 1.1-3.5), and feeding ionophores to cows (OR=2.1; CI: 1.2-3.7). Herds that used a broadcast/solid spread had lower odds (OR=0.26; CI: 0.11-0.63) of being Salmonella positive. Herds with at least one resistant isolate were more likely to have used composted/dried manure for bedding relative to herds with only susceptible isolates (OR=3.6; CI: 1.2-11.0). These results can be useful to focus additional research aimed at decreasing the prevalence of Salmonella and AMR Salmonella on U.S. dairy herds.
