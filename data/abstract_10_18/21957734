The aim of the present study was to evaluate the antibiotic susceptibility of methicillin-susceptible (MS) and methicillin-resistant (MR) coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CNS) strains isolated from milk of cows with mastitis. The study was conducted on 100 CNS strains (20 MRCNS and 80 MSCNS) isolated from milk samples of 86 cows from the Lublin (Poland) region farms. Antibiotic susceptibility of microorganisms was evaluated using the disc-diffusion method on the Mueller-Hinton agar according to the guidelines of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). The highest efficacy against MSCNS was demonstrated for cephalosporin antibiotics, i.e. cefacetril (91.3%), ceftiofur (67.5%), cefoperazone (66.3%) and cephalexin (60.0% of susceptible MSCNS strains). Moreover, a high percentage of vancomycin-susceptible strains was demonstrated (83.8%). The activity of combination of amoxicillin with clavulanic acid and gentamicin was found weaker (63.8% and 61.3% of susceptible strains, respectively). About 50.0% of MSCNS were susceptible to erythromycin, enrofloxacine and amoxicillin. A large proportion of CNS was resistant to neomycin, penicillin, tetracycline, streptomycin, lincomycin and ampicillin (28.8%, 30.0%, 31.3%, 31.3%, 33.8% and 33.8% of susceptible strains, respectively). The highest percentage of MRCNS was susceptible to vancomycin (75.0%), erythromycin (65.0%) and streptomycin (50.0%). Their susceptibility to enrofloxacine (35.0%) as well as gentamicin and tetracycline (30.0%) was markedly lower. The lowest activity was found for lincomycin and neomycin (20.0% of susceptible MRCNS strains, each).
