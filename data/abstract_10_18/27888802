Chemoresistance represents a major challenge for treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Thus, new drugs to overcome chemoresistance in ALL are urgently needed. To this end, we established a cytarabine (araC)-resistant ALL cell line (NALM-6/R), which interestingly displayed cross-resistance towards doxorubicin (ADM). Here we report that low dose of triptolide (TPL), a natural product used for treating inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, could reverse araC and ADM resistance and in NALM-6/R cells as well as primary cells from patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) ALL, reflected by inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in vitro, and repression of tumor growth in vivo in a mouse xenograft model. Mechanistically, these events were associated with impaired mitochondrial membrane potential and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Co-treatment with TPL and araC or ADM upregulated pro-apoptotic caspase-9 protein, inhibited checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) and 2 (Chk2) phosphorylation, and induced gammaH2A.X (a DNA damage marker). Notably, the combination regimen of TPL and conventional chemotherapeutics also rapidly diminished tumor burden in a patient with R/R ALL. Together, these findings provide preclinical evidence for repurposing use of TPL in combination with chemotherapeutic agents to treat R/R ALL as an alternative salvage regimen.
