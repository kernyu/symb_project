OBJECTIVE: To identify commonly reported community-acquired organisms and antimicrobial resistance patterns exhibited by Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens among pilgrims visiting emergency care departments in Makkah. METHOD: The study was designed as a retrospective audit of all patients (pilgrims) admitted to two hospitals and residing in the city of Makkah, Saudi Arabia. RESULTS: Among 374 isolates, Gram-negative pathogens accounted for 280 (75%), while the remaining 94 (25%) were Gram-positive organisms. Among all isolated pathogens, the highest resistance was observed for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Klebsiella pneumoniae had the highest resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and ampicillin. Most of the organisms were sensitive to tobramycin except Acinetobacter baumannii (n=3, 50%), Escherichia coli (n=4, 57%), and K. pneumoniae (n=6, 46%). CONCLUSION: Overall, a high resistance was observed for beta-lactam antibiotics. In addition, a high resistance was noted for ceftazidime with A. baumannii species (n=16, 77%). However, for quinolones, the highest resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed for E. coli, A. baumannii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and K. pneumoniae.
