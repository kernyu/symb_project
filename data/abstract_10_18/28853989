Shigella flexneri is one of the most prominent pathogenic bacteria in developing countries. In the battle against shigellosis and other bacterial diseases, antibiotic resistance has become an increasing global public health threat. Although the serious phenomenon of multidrug resistance (MDR) has been identified as one of the top three burdens on human health, resistance mechanisms are still poorly understood at the molecular level. In this study, we analyzed genomic data and the evolution of resistance in Shigella flexneri under sequential selection stress from three separate antibiotics: ciprofloxacin (CIP), ceftriaxone (CRO), and tetracycline. Through whole-genome sequencing, 82 chromosomal antibiotic resistance genes were identified. Re-sequencing of the evolved populations identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that contributed to MDR and SNPs that were specific to a single drug. A total of 40 SNPs in 8 genes and 3 intergenic regions, including mutations in metG (L582R) and 1538924, 1538924, and 1538924, appeared under each antibiotic. Several nonsynonymous mutations in gyrB (S464Y), ydgA (E378A), rob (R156H), and narX (K75E) were observed under selective pressure from CIP or CRO. Based on a bioinformatic analysis and previous reports, we discuss the contribution of these mutated genes to resistance. Therefore, more circumspect selection and use of antimicrobial drugs for treating shigellosis is necessary.
