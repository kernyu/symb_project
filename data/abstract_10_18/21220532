Bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, etc.) is commonly the result of the production of beta-lactamases. The emergence of beta-lactamases capable of turning over carbapenem antibiotics is of great concern, since these are often considered the last resort antibiotics in the treatment of life-threatening infections. beta-Lactamases of the GES family are extended-spectrum enzymes that include members that have acquired carbapenemase activity through a single amino acid substitution at position 170. We investigated inhibition of the GES-1, -2, and -5 beta-lactamases by the clinically important beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. While GES-1 and -5 are susceptible to inhibition by clavulanic acid, GES-2 shows the greatest susceptibility. This is the only variant to possess the canonical asparagine at position 170. The enzyme with asparagine, as opposed to glycine (GES-1) or serine (GES-5), then leads to a higher affinity for clavulanic acid (K(i) = 5 muM), a higher rate constant for inhibition, and a lower partition ratio (r approximately 20). Asparagine at position 170 also results in the formation of stable complexes, such as a cross-linked species and a hydrated aldehyde. In contrast, serine at position 170 leads to formation of a long-lived trans-enamine species. These studies provide new insight into the importance of the residue at position 170 in determining the susceptibility of GES enzymes to clavulanic acid.
