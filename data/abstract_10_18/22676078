In China, there are four types of liver abscesses (LAs) that meet the clinical criteria. Pyogenic liver abscesses (PLAs) and amoebic liver abscesses (ALAs) are two of the most common types of abscesses, followed by fungal liver abscesses (FLAs) and hydatid secondary liver abscesses (HsLAs). Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with the development of PLAs. However, there is a lack of population-based studies that have evaluated the underlying relationship between LAs (mainly PLAs and FLAs) and DM. We conducted a retrospective study based on a large population to identify the potential differences and factors that affect the mortality of PLA patients in DM and non-DM groups. Our results revealed that the prevalence of DM is 44.3% (158/357) in PLA patients and 35.3% (18/51) in FLA patients. Compared with the non-DM patients, statistically significant differences were found in DM patients according to symptomatology, clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, microbiological characteristics, antimicrobial resistance, clinical treatments and outcomes in relation to mortality. In addition, the status of antibiotic resistance to E. coli and K. pneumoniae, which were isolated from the patient samples, is severe in the area in which the study was conducted. Regarding the treatment of PLAs, our study indicated that broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy and drug combinations should be recommended and initiated before the pathogens are cultured and identified. In the clinic, therapies that combine percutaneous drainage with antibiotics and surgery with antibiotics are the two most useful strategies for treating an LA. These two combined treatments resulted in satisfactory cure rates. In the DM and non-DM groups, the cure rates for percutaneous drainage with antibiotics were 90.3% and 92.0%, respectively, and the cure rates for surgery with antibiotics were 93.9% and 95.2%, respectively.
