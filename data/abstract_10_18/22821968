The organic hydroperoxide resistance protein Ohr has been identified in numerous bacteria where it functions in the detoxification of organic hydroperoxides, and expression of ohr is often regulated by a MarR-type regulator called OhrR. The genes annotated as BAB2_0350 and BAB2_0351 in the Brucella abortus 2308 genome sequence are predicted to encode OhrR and Ohr orthologs, respectively. Using isogenic ohr and ohrR mutants and lacZ promoter fusions, it was determined that Ohr contributes to resistance to organic hydroperoxide, but not hydrogen peroxide, in B. abortus 2308 and that OhrR represses the transcription of both ohr and ohrR in this strain. Moreover, electrophoretic mobility shift assays and DNase I footprinting revealed that OhrR binds directly to a specific region in the intergenic region between ohr and ohrR that shares extensive nucleotide sequence similarity with so-called "OhrR boxes" described in other bacteria. While Ohr plays a prominent role in protecting B. abortus 2308 from organic hydroperoxide stress in in vitro assays, this protein is not required for the wild-type virulence of this strain in cultured murine macrophages or experimentally infected mice.
