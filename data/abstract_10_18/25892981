Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) infection is one of the most common chronic bacterial infections worldwide. International guidelines recommend H pylori eradication in several scenarios: patients with peptic ulcer disease, patients who have had endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer, and patients with a gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (MALToma). There is variability among the guidelines for other conditions. Treatment options for H pylori infection include triple, quadruple, and sequential therapy. Ideally, patients in whom previous eradication attempts failed and those suspected to have resistant strains should be considered for antimicrobial sensitivity testing, which requires culture of gastric mucosal biopsies; such testing, however, has limited availability in the United States. Resistance rates vary by location depending on local antibiotic usage rates. As such, the success rates associated with different regimens vary throughout the world. Many patients with H pylori infection are asymptomatic, whereas others are diagnosed with the infection during evaluation of dyspeptic symptoms or following a diagnosis of peptic ulcer. Symptoms may not be an accurate indicator of treatment success. The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) endorses the carbon 13-labeled urea breath test ((13)C-UBT) as the most reliable test to confirm H pylori eradication. This clinical roundtable monograph begins with an overview of H pylori infection and then discusses treatment, antibiotic resistance, management of patients with antibiotic resistance, and posttreatment testing, with a focus on the ACG guidelines.
