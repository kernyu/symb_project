A study was conducted to evaluate and compare the effect of cavity disinfectants on the fracture resistance of primary molars restored with indirect composite inlays. Thirty-six non-carious primary second molars were selected and divided randomly into three groups (n = 12): control group (no disinfectant), chlorhexidine group (disinfected with 2% chlorhexidine for 40 seconds) and sodium hypochlorite group crowns (disinfected with 2% chlorhexidine for 40 seconds). The inlays were fabricated by indirect method using Ceram X nanocomposite on plaster die. All the groups were submitted to compression mechanic test in a Hounsfield universal testing machine at 1 mm/min cross-head speed and the results were calculated in Newtons. Descriptive statistics, independent t test, and one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test revealed the mean fracture resistance of three groups, i.e., control group, chlorhexidine group and sodium hypochlorite group to be 2260.66, 1858.08 and 1310.66, respectively. When intragroup comparisons were made, a significant difference was observed in all the groups (P<0.001). Scheffe's post hoc test revealed that control group had the highest fracture resistance, followed by chlorhexidine group, and sodium hypochlorite group had the least fracture resistance. Each value differed significantly from the other (P<0.05). Cavity disinfectants used in the present study had detrimental effect on the fracture resistance of primary molars. Among the disinfectants employed in the present study, chlorhexidine showed a better resistance to fracture than sodium hypochlorite.
