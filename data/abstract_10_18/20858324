Antimicrobial resistance is increasing rapidly and there are hardly any new antimicrobial agents to be expected in the coming years. The number of patients affected by extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing organisms (ESBLs) is rising and there are strong indications that this is caused in part by the use of antimicrobial agents in animal husbandry. There are many arguments against the widespread use of antimicrobial agents in food-production animals, but this has not resulted in decreased usage so far. The current situation is critical and requires immediate action. In human healthcare the prescription of 'rescue' antibiotics, e.g. carbapenems, has to be restricted and controlled. In animal husbandry the use of antibiotics has to be reduced dramatically and a more sustainable approach to food production has to be supported by government and consumers.
