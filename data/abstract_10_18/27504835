INTRODUCTION: Fifty-six E. coli, 37 P. multocida und 8 M. haemolytica were isolated from 157 nasal swabs taken from calves in 52 dairy herds. The antibiotic susceptibility of the organisms was determined by measurement of the minimal inhibitory concentrations. Of the 56 E. coli isolates, 55.3% exhibited resistance to tetracyclines, 55.3% to sulfonamides, 39.3% to beta-lactams, 30.3% to aminoglycosides, 8.9% to fluorochinolones and 3.5% to 3rd generation cephalosporins. The 3rd generation cephalosporin- resistant isolates contained the extended spectrum-beta-lactamase gene blaCTX-M-14 and came from 2 farms where the milk of cows under antimicrobial treatment was fed to the calves and mastitis was treated with cefquinome as first line therapy. Of the 37 P. multocida isolates, 48.6% exhibited resistance to tetracyclines, 16.2% to beta-lactams, and 5.4% each to macrolides, aminoglycosides and sulfonamides. The 8 M. haemolytica isolates showed no resistances against the tested antibiotics.
