BACKGROUND: Environmental contamination is a reservoir for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) in hospitals. METHODS: Environmental sampling of surfaces was undertaken anytime before disinfection and 1 hour after disinfection utilizing a sodium dichloroisocyanurate-based, 3-staged protocol (phase 1) or benzalkonium chloride-based, single-stage clean (phase 2). VRE colonization and infection rates are presented from 2010 to 2011, and audits of cleaning completeness were also analyzed. RESULTS: Environmental samples collected before disinfection were significantly more likely to be contaminated with VRE during phase 1 than phase 2: 25.2% versus 4.6%, respectively; odds ratio (OR), 7.01 (P < .01). Environmental samples collected after disinfection were also significantly more likely to yield VRE during phase 1 compared with phase 2: 11.2% versus 1.1%, respectively; OR, 11.73 (P < .01). Rates of VRE colonization were higher during 2010 than 2011. Cleaning audits showed similar results over both time periods. CONCLUSION: During use of a chlorine-based, 3-staged protocol, significantly higher residual levels of VRE contamination were identified, compared with levels detected during use of a benzalkonium chloride-based product for disinfection. This reduction in VRE may be due to a new disinfection product, more attention to the thoroughness of cleaning, or other supplementary efforts in our institution.
