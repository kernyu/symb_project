More than 20 drugs have been available for anti-HIV-1 treatment in Japan. Combination therapy with these drugs dramatically decreases in morbidity and mortality of AIDS. However, due to high mutation rate of HIV-1, treatment with ineffective drugs toward patients infected with HIV-1 causes accumulation of mutations in the virus, and emergence of drug resistant viruses. Thus, to achieve appropriate application of the drugs toward the respective patients living with HIV-1, methods for predicting the level of drug-resistance using viral sequence information has been developed on the basis of bioinformatics. Furthermore, ultra-deep sequencing by next-generation sequencer whose data analysis is also based on bioinformatics, or in silico structural modeling have been achieved to understand drug resistant mechanisms. In this review, I overview the bioinformatics studies about drug resistance against anti-HIV-1 drugs.
