SCOPE: To advance knowledge of the stress tolerance mechanisms of a probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum strain to dietary hydroxycinnamic acids and the role of gut commensal microorganisms in the bioactivation of polyphenols. METHODS AND RESULTS: To understand how gut commensal microorganisms tolerate toxicity of hydroxycinnamic acids and bioactivate these compounds, we used whole genome transcriptional profiling to characterize the response of a L. plantarum human isolate during challenge with p-coumaric acid (p-CA). The transcriptional profile reveals a massive induction of genes involved in stress resistance and detoxification-related functions and a global shutdown of growth-associated processes. A specific oxidative stress response, including a large reshape of nitrogen metabolism toward methionine production, was induced, probably to counteract a p-CA-induced oxidative protein stress. The transcriptional datasets revealed overlapping behaviors with the response of L. plantarum to the gut environment. CONCLUSION: Contact with p-CA triggers responses that would be potentially beneficial for the intestinal function such as detoxification of dietary hydroxycinnamic acids and induction of a marked antioxidant response. Elicited responses indicated that contact with p-CA could provide preparedness to L. plantarum for adaptation to the gut environment. This knowledge facilitates the way to design methods to improve probiotic cell survival in this habitat.
