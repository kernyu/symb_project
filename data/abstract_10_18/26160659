This study investigated the effect of a beta-x200B;hydroxyphosphonate analog of L-carnitine (L-CA) (CAS number: 1220955-x200B;20-3, Component: 1221068-91-2, C12H29NO4PI), (3-Hexanaminium, 1-(dimethoxyphosphinyl)-2-hydroxy-N,N,N,5-x200B;tetramethy-iodide (1:1), (2R, 3S)) on parameters related with type-2 diabetes in an in vitro model. Nontoxic concentrations of L-CA were assayed and compared to commercial L-carnitine effects. L-CA did not affect adipogenesis in normal cells, but an increment of TG accumulation was observed on insulin-resistant adipocytes (80%) when compared with resistant control. L-CA also stimulated glucose analog 2-NBDG uptakes on insulin-resistant adipocytes in a similar way as insulin when compared to insulin-resistant cells. Our results show that the L-CA promoted insulin-like responses on insulin-resistant adipocytes without appreciable pro-adipogenic effect in sensitive adipocytes.
