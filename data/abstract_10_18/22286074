The synthetic reconstruction of natural gene networks and the de novo design of artificial genetic circuits provide new insights into the cell's regulatory mechanisms and will open new opportunities for drug discovery and intelligent therapeutic schemes. We will present how modular synthetic biology tools like repressors, promoters and enzymes can be assembled into complex systems in order to discover small molecules to shut off antibiotic resistance in tubercle bacteria and to design self-sufficient therapeutic networks. The transfer of these synthetic biological modules to the materials science field enables the construction of novel drug-inducible biohybrid materials for biomedical applications.
