Group B streptococcus (GBS) has emerged as an important cause of invasive infection in adults. Here, we report the clinical and microbiological characteristics of 401 non-redundant GBS strains causing adult invasive infections collected during a 4-year period (2007-2010). Bacteraemia without focus (43.4%) and bone and joint infections (18.7%) were the main clinical manifestations. The distribution of capsular polysaccharide (CPS) type showed that types Ia, III, and V accounted for 71.8% of all strains. Resistance to erythromycin increased from 20.2% in 2007 to 35.3% in 2010, and was mainly associated with CPS type V harbouring the erm(B) resistant determinant.
