In the majority of cases of vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VR E. faecalis) served as the vanA donor to S. aureus. Previous studies that evaluated the risk factors for co-colonization with VRE and MRSA did not differentiate between VR E. faecalis and VR E. faecium. This study aimed to identify variables associated with VR E. faecalis and MRSA co-colonization. A retrospective case-control study from January 2008 to December 2009 was conducted at the Detroit Medical Center. Data were extracted from charts and pharmacy records. Unique patients co-colonized with VR E. faecalis and MRSA (defined as isolation of MRSA within 7 days of VR E. faecalis isolation) were compared with patients with VR E. faecalis who were not co-colonized with MRSA. A total of 546 patients with VR E. faecalis isolation were identified. 85 (15.6 %) VR E. faecalis patients were co-colonized with MRSA and 461 (84.4 %) VR E. faecalis patients were not co-colonized with MRSA. The mean age of the study cohort was 65.9 +/- 16.4 years, 424 (77.7 %) were African-American, and 270 (49.5 %) were residing in long-term care institutions. Independent predictors of co-colonization of VR E. faecalis and MRSA were male gender, impaired consciousness, ICU stay prior to VR E. faecalis isolation, indwelling devices, and isolation of VR E. faecalis from wounds. MRSA was frequently isolated from the same culture specimen as VR E. faecalis (n = 39, 45.9 %), most commonly from wounds. This large study of patients with VR E. faecalis identified the severity of illness, indwelling devices, and chronic wounds as independent predictors of co-colonization with VR E. faecalis and MRSA.
