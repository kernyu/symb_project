INTRODUCTION: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a major obsession for TB control. The main risk factor for MDR-TB remains a history of TB treatment especially bad conduct. The objective of this study is to describe the profile of patients in situations of failure and relapse of tuberculosis. METHODS: We performed a retrospective survey of the analysis of records of patients starting TB retreatment for failure or relapse of tuberculosis. We used 193 cases with results of culture-sensitivity. RESULTS: The proportion of failure is 59/193 (30.6 %) and cases of relapse are 134/193 (69.4 %). The proportion of married life is 23.4 % (11/47) in chess against 41.5 % (51/123) in relapse of TB [P=0.021, OR=0.431 (0.201 to 0.927)]. Patients failing therapy have more chest pain [5.8 % (3/52) versus 0 % (0/126) with P=0.024]. The proportion of MDR-TB was 61.4 (38/59) in case of failure against 41 % (55/134) in case of relapse [P=0.002, OR=2.599 (1.378 to 4.902)]. The evolution is the same whatever the indication of reprocessing. CONCLUSION: The proportion of MDR-TB is very important in case of reprocessing failure and relapse of tuberculosis.
