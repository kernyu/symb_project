Staphylococcus sciuri strains were unexpectedly cultured from healthy persons and patients from Indonesia during a population-based survey on nasal Staphylococcus aureus carriage. Fifty-one S. sciuri isolates were further characterized. The S. aureus mecA gene was detected by PCR in 22 isolates (43.1%), whereas S. sciuri mecA was found in 33 isolates (64.7%). The staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) regions of S. aureus mecA-positive isolates contained elements of classical S. aureus SCCmec types II and/or III.
