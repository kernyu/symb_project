A new isolate of Streptomyces sp. from soil of state Chhattisgarh (India) having broad spectrum antibacterial and antifungal activity was obtained. The active strain was identified as Streptomyces rimosus subsp. rimosus with accession number MTCC 10792 based on physiological, biochemical characteristics and 16S rRNA sequence homology studies. Antimicrobial compound produced by S. rimosus was tested against the drug resistance pathogens by the Bauer and Kirby method. The crude active metabolite was extracted using solvent n-butanol and purified by silica column chromatography and HPLC method. The physicochemical characteristics of the one purified compound viz. color, melting point, solubility, elemental analysis; ESIMS, IR,UV, 1HNMR, 13CNMR and chemical reactions have been investigated. Purified antimicrobial compound produced by S. rimosus MTCC 10792 at concentration 25 mug/ml showed antitubercular activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra as well as broad activity against all tested bacterial and fungal pathogens.
