More than 400,000 primary hip and knee replacement surgeries are performed each year in the United States. From these procedures, approximately 0.5-3% will become infected and when considering revision surgeries, this rate has been found to increase significantly. Antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections are a growing problem in patient care. This in vitro research investigated the antimicrobial potential of the polymer released, broad spectrum, Cationic Steroidal Antimicrobial-13 (CSA-13) for challenges against 5 x 10(8) colony forming units (CFU) of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). It was hypothesized that a weight-to-weight (w/w) concentration of 18% CSA-13 in silicone would exhibit potent bactericidal potential when used as a controlled release device coating. When incorporated into a polymeric device coating, the 18% (w/w) broad-spectrum polymer released CSA-13 antimicrobial eliminated 5 x 10(8) CFU of MRSA within 8 h. In the future, these results will be utilized to develop a sheep model to assess CSA-13 for the prevention of perioperative device-related infections in vivo.
