OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of the K65R, K103N and M184V/I resistance mutations in the reverse transcriptase (RT) region in HIV-1-infected patients failing antiretroviral-based regimens between the years 2005 and 2010. PATIENTS AND METHODS: HIV-1-infected patients experiencing virological failure between 2005 and 2010 with RT genotypic resistance tests available at the time of virological failure were analysed. K65R, K103N and M184V/I mutation frequencies were determined each year. Statistical analyses were performed using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Among 9586 patients failing their antiretroviral-based regimens from 2005 to 2010, the prevalence of K65R tended to decrease (P = 0.054), while K103N and M184V/I mutation frequencies decreased significantly over time (P < 0.001). The increased use of a tenofovir/emtricitabine/efavirenz single-tablet regimen was associated with decreased selection of these mutations. CONCLUSIONS: The global prevalence of resistance-associated mutations to tenofovir, lamivudine/emtricitabine and efavirenz decreased over time between 2005 and 2010. Despite a stable rate of efavirenz and protease inhibitor use, this phenomenon can be explained by an increased use of single-tablet regimens, which simplify drug intake and maximize adherence.
