BACKGROUND: An eight (8) months prospective study was carried out to control an outbreak of nosocomial pneumonia due to a Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL) producing Staphylococcus aureus, in the paediatrics' unit at the Zou/Collines Departmental Hospital (CHDZ/C), (Benin). METHODS: Between 1(st) September 2004 and 30(th) May 2005 an investigation was conducted that involved the screening of all patients suspected to have nosocomial pneumonia, hospital environment sampling and the follow-up of cases until the end of hospital admission period. Isolates were identified, tested for antimicrobial susceptibility and analysed for PVL production. The study period was divided into Period I, corresponding to the outbreak period and Period II, after the complete renovation of the Unit along with hand washing promotion. RESULTS: A total of 453 patients were admitted during the period of the study; (235 during Period I and 218 during Period II) in the malnourished children sector. Twenty eight (28) cases of pneumonia due to S. aureus were discovered and PVL-producing S. aureus constituted 61% (17/28) of identified cases. The mortality rate among the PVL- producing strains was 15/17 (88%) while it was 1/11 (9%) among non PVL-producing strains. Enhanced hygiene measures helped to terminate the outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that PVL was strongly linked to nosocomial pneumonia. PVL-producing S aureus can be controlled in the hospital by a combination of the promotion of preventive measures, decontamination of the environment and the early use of the correct antibiotic at the appropriate dose and for an adequate duration.
