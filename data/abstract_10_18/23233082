We evaluated the efficacy of ethylenediamine-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, disodium calcium salt (Ca-EDTA), as an inhibitor for New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) in vitro antibiotic susceptibility and in a mouse model of sepsis caused by Escherichia coli. Ca-EDTA drastically reduced the MICs of carbapenems for all NDM-producing bacteria [imipenem (IPM) </=1-2 mug/ml; meropenem (MEPM) </=1-4 microg/ml]. In the neutropenic murine model of sepsis, the bacterial burden was further reduced by combination therapy using imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) and Ca-EDTA to 2.3 x 10(3) CFU/liver, compared with 2.9 x 10(4) CFU/liver for IPM/CS alone. These data demonstrated the possibility of Ca-EDTA for clinical applications. In our understanding, this is the first report examining the effect of Ca-EDTA on a mouse sepsis model caused by NDM-1-producing bacteria.
