AIM: The retro-prospective analysis of antibiotic sensitivity of non-fermenting gram negative bacilli strains circulating in the Orthopedics-Traumatology Clinic from "Sf. Spiridon" Emergency Clinical Hospital in view of determining the trend of the resistance phenomenon and indicating the most useful treatment for the infections caused by these strains. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The retrospective component was conducted from 01.01.2003 to 31.12.2012, and the result of the diffusimetric antibiograms was taken from the hospital's informatics system; the prospective component of the study involved the collection of pathological products from the patients admitted during January-December 2013, who showed clinical suspicion of infection, in compliance with the general collection norms for the products destined for the bacteriological exam. RESULTS: From the total 167 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated and identified from the patients, 48 (28.74%) were sensitive to at least one antibiotic from each tested class, 29 (17.39%) were resistant to a single antibiotic and the rest of 90 (53.89%) showed multiple resistance. We noticed a statistically significant difference between the number of strains sensitive to at least one antibiotic from each tested class and those with multiple resistance (p < 0.05). For the strains of Acinetobacter baumanii combined resistance was identified for 121 (87.04%), out of which 55 (39.56%) were resistant to two classes of antibiotics and the other (47.48%) to all three classes. The most frequently met was the association of resistance to quinolones and aminoglycosides, namely for a number of 49 strains (35.25%); only 3.59% of them were simultaneously sensitive to the three classes of antibiotics. CONCLUSION: The already high percentages and the rising trends of antibiotic resistance of non-fermenting gram-negative bacteria described in this study confirm the continuous decrease of the efficiency of antimicrobial agents and underline the necessity of a global strategy which aims at all health sectors regarding the rational use of antibiotics, on the one hand, and the continuation of studies concerning the surveillance of the antimicrobial resistance phenomenon, on the other hand.
