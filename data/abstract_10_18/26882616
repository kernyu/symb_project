OBJECTIVE: To perform a transcriptomics study in differential genes after Xianglian External Lotion (XEL) induced the recovery of drug-resistant Candida albicans strains sensitive to Fluconazole. METHODS: Broth microdilution antifungal susceptibility test was used to detect minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of drug-resistant Candida albicans strains induced by XEL. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) was used to determine and compare the transcription of primary drug-resistant Candida aIbicans strains and sensitive strains induced by XEL. High expressed genes and signaling pathways strains were analyzed by gene ontology (GO) method. RESULTS: XEL could induce drug-resistant strains of the 6th generations to recover sensitivity. Transcriptome sequencing showed that, as compared with primary drug-resistant strains, there were 165 genes with up-regulated RPKM index and 144 genes with down-regulated RPKM index after XEL induction. GO analyses found that all genes were mainly classified as GO:0015903 (fluconazole transport). CONCLUSIONS: XEL could induce the recovery of drug-resistant Candida albicans strains sensitive to Fluconazole. By analyzing transcriptomes, authors speculated that XEL could recover strain sensitivity to fluconazole by opening fluconazole transport pathway.
