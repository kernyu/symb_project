A self-made multi-walled carbon nanotubes electrode was characterized by SEM, FITR, CV and Tafel, and applied to study the electrochemical reduction degradation of refractory organics, using ceftazidime as model pollutant, and the mass concentration after the reduction was measured by the HPLC. The results indicate that the electrode has perfect stability, good resistance to corrosion, and perfect performance. According to the CV, a larger oxidation peak was obtained at about 800 mV, with a peak value of -0.2 mA, and the degradation of ceftazidime on the electrode was irreversible. The optimum conditions of the the electrochemical reduction degradation of ceftazidime on carbon nanotubes electrode were: electrode spacing of 1 cm, a voltage of 15 V, an initial concentration of 1 mg x L(-1), ionic strength of 1 g x L(-1), and a pH value of 6.0. Under such conditions, the removal efficiency of ceftazidime reached up to 90% when the reaction time was 60 min, and the degradation process conforms to the second-order kinetics.
