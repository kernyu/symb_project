Ti-Cu sintered alloys have shown good antibacterial abilities. However, the sintered method (powder metallurgy) is not convenient to produce devices with a complex structure. In this paper, Ti-Cu alloys with 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 wt.% Cu were prepared in an arc melting furnace and subjected to different heat treatments: solid solution and ageing, to explore the possibility of preparing an antibacterial Ti-Cu alloy by a casting method and to examine the effect of Cu content. Phase identification was conducted on an XRD diffraction meter, and the microstructure was observed by a metallographic microscope, a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with energy disperse spectroscopy (EDS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Microhardness and the compressive property of Ti-Cu alloys were tested, and the corrosion resistance and antibacterial activity were assessed in order to investigate the effect of the Cu content. Results showed that the as-cast Ti-Cu alloys exhibited a very low antibacterial rate against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Heat treatment improved the antibacterial rate significantly, especially after a solid and ageing treatment (T6). Antibacterial rates as high as 90.33% and 92.57% were observed on Ti-3Cu alloy and Ti-4Cu alloy, respectively. The hardness, the compressive yield strength, the anticorrosion resistance and the antibacterial rate of Ti-Cu alloys increased with an increase of Cu content in all conditions. It was demonstrated that homogeneous distribution and a fine Ti2Cu phase played a very important role in the mechanical property, anticorrosion and antibacterial properties. Furthermore, it should be pointed out that the Cu content should be at least 3 wt.% to obtain good antibacterial properties (>90% antibacterial rate) as well as satisfactory mechanical properties.
