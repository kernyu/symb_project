BACKGROUND: Here, the baseline and emergent resistance to elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF) versus efavirenz (EFV)/FTC/TDF in HIV-1-infected antiretroviral-naive adults through 144 weeks from the randomized, ongoing, Phase III study GS-US-236-0102 is described. METHODS: HIV-1 protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) were sequenced at screening; patients with HIV-1 resistant to EFV, FTC or TDF were excluded. Genotypic/phenotypic analyses were performed at virological failure confirmation and baseline for PR, RT and integrase (IN) for patients with virological failure and for patients with HIV-1 RNA>/=400 copies/ml at weeks 48, 96, 144 or early study drug discontinuation. Retrospective, baseline, IN genotyping was conducted for EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF patients. RESULTS: In the EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF group through week 144, HIV-1 from 10 patients (2.9%; 10/348 treated patients) developed primary IN strand transfer inhibitor (n=9) and/or nucleoside RT inhibitor resistance substitutions (n=10). The emergence of resistance decreased over time with 8, 2 and 0 patients developing HIV-1 resistance through week 48, post-week 48-96 and post-week 96-144, respectively. Emergent substitutions were E92Q (n=7), N155H (n=3), Q148R (n=1) and T66I (n=1) in IN, and M184V/I (n=10) and K65R (n=4) in RT. All 10 isolates had reduced susceptibility to EVG, FTC or TDF. Virus with EVG phenotypic resistance had cross-resistance to raltegravir. In the EFV/FTC/TDF group, virus from 14 patients (4.0%; 14/352 treated patients; 4 during weeks 96-144) developed a resistance substitution to EFV (n=14; K103N: n=13), FTC (M184V/I: n=4) or TDF (K65R: n=3). CONCLUSIONS: Resistance development to EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF was infrequent through 144 weeks of therapy and decreased over time, consistent with durable efficacy.
