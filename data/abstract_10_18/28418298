Among 42 gram-negative bloodstream isolates from inpatients in 3 hospitals in Yangon, Myanmar, admitted during July-December 2014, 16 (38%) were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae and 6 (14%) produced carbapenemase. The high prevalence of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria raises concerns about the empiric treatment of patients with sepsis in Yangon.
