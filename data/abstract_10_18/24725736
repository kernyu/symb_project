Given increasing resistance, therapeutic options to treat MRSA soft tissue infections should be evaluated. This pooled analysis evaluated data from subjects enrolled in 6 tigecycline clinical trials with documented MRSA complicated skin and skin structure infections or diabetic foot infections (DFIs). Baseline characteristics were compared between subjects with and without molecularly classified community-acquired (CA) MRSA, specifically staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) IV. Clinical response was compared by CA-MRSA designation and treatment group. A total of 378 subjects with MRSA soft tissue infections were identified, including 79 with DFI. A total of 249 (65.9%) were molecularly classified as CA-MRSA. Clinical response rates for MRSA soft tissue infection were similar between tigecycline and vancomycin (treatment difference, 1.0%; 95% confidence interval: -9.3, 12.0) as well as by infection type, SCCmec, and Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) status. Tigecycline demonstrated comparable efficacy for treatment of MRSA soft tissue infections regardless of infection type, SCCmec, or PVL status.
