The conventional treatment of infectious agents is increasingly encountering antimicrobial resistance. This resistance has led to an intense search for novel treatment modalities for infectious diseases. Elucidation of the mechanisms underlying the inhibitory activity of chemokines has been instrumental in the rational design of anti-human immunodeficiency virus chemokine drugs. The immune-based therapies, in combination with antimicrobial drugs, for viral hepatitis have attracted much attention. Recognition of toll-like receptors by synthetic immunomodulators is used for certain viral infections. New methodologies have the potential to identify novel targets and foster the development of individually tailored immunomodulatory drug treatments.
