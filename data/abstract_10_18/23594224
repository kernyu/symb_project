BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Enterococci are emerging causes of severe infections, including wound and bone infections in orthopedic patients. The main purpose of this study was to determine whether there was a correlation between the incidence of enterococci in tissue samples (biopsies) from orthopedic patients and consumption of cefuroxime in the orthopedic department. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data were obtained from the department of clinical microbiology and the hospital pharmacy. The consumption of cefuroxime successively increased from 40 defined daily doses (DDD)/10(3) bed days in 2002 to 212 DDD/10(3) bed days in 2009. The incidence of patients with enterococci in tissue samples increased steadily from 1.03/10(3) bed days in 2002 to 5.90/10(3) bed days in 2009. Regression analysis revealed a significant correlation between the consumption of cefuroxime and the incidence of enterococci. INTERPRETATION: Continuous surveillance of species distribution, resistance rates, and antibiotic consumption is of utmost importance for optimal antibiotic strategy in orthopedic patients.
