With multidrug resistant bacteria on the rise, novel antibiotics are becoming highly sought after. In 2008, eleven compounds were identified by high throughput screening as inhibitors of BasE, a key enzyme of the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase pathway found in Acinetobacter baumannii. Herein, we describe the preparation of four structurally similar heterocyclic lead compounds from that study, including one 1,2,5-oxadiazole. A further library of 30 analogues containing the oxadiazole moiety was then generated. All compounds were screened against Acinetobacter baumannii and their minimum inhibitory concentration data is reported, with (E)-3-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-N-(4-methyl-1,2,5-oxadiazol-3-yl)acrylamide 32 found to have an MIC of 0.5mM. This work provides the foundation for further investigation of 1,2,5-oxadizoles as novel inhibitors of A. baumannii.
