A new series of mangostin analogs of natural alpha-mangostin from mangosteen was prepared and their antimycobacterial activity was evaluated in vitro against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H(37)Ra. The results showed that the monoalkyl tetrahydro alpha-mangostin analogs displayed increased antimycobacterial activity as compared with the lead natural xanthone, alpha-mangostin. Among the tested compounds, 6-methoxytetrahydro alpha-mangostin (16) exhibited the most potent antimycobacterial activity with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.78 microg/mL. The activity of the monoalkylated and monoacylated tetrahydro alpha-mangostins decreases as the length of carbon chain increases. The methyl ether analog was also active against the multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains with pronounced MICs of 0.78-1.56 microg/mL.
