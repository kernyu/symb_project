Thirty eight vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) were isolated in one year surveillance study for hospital infection control programme in a state hospital in Ankara, Turkey. All isolates were identified as Enterococcus faecium by VITEK2 system (bioMerieux, France). Vancomycin and teicoplanin resistant 30 strains were defined as vanA phenotype while vancomycin-resistant teicoplanin-susceptible eight strains were defined as vanB phenotype. vanA genes were found in 30 strains while vanB genes were found in five strains by using PCR method. Those five strains were the first vanB positive E.faecium strains in our country. VRE strains revealed six different band patterns by PFGE, while six isolates could not be classified. All isolates with vanB type resistance were found in the same cluster. Source of vanB positive strains was considered as the hemodialysis unit. When the previous national reports related to vancomycin-resistant enterococci were considered, this was the first report of vanB positive E.faecium isolates in our country. This emphasized that both the diversity of VRE and the isolation rate was increasing. In order to eliminate the spread of VRE, effective surveillance studies should be performed and protective measures should be established promptly.
