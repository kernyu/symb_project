The aim of this study was to determine the presence of and characterize methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) isolated from pets in South China. From 2007 to 2009, 898 samples were collected from 785 pets in Guangdong Province. The identity of staphylococcal species and the presence of methicillin resistance were confirmed by phenotypic and genotypic assays. The genetic relationships of MRSP isolates were determined by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), PFGE and spa typing. SCCmec elements and antimicrobial resistance genes profiling were characterized by PCR amplification. A total of 144 S. pseudintermedius isolates were recovered from the dogs and cats tested, and 69 (47.9%) of these isolates were identified as MRSP. Most of the MRSP isolates exhibited simultaneous resistance to four or more different antimicrobial agents. However, valnemulin showed robust activity against MRSP (MIC(90)=1 mug/ml). Integron 1, 2 and 3 were not detected in MRSP isolates. Twenty-four different multilocus sequence types were found among the MRSP isolates, with ST4 (n=9), ST5 (n=8), and ST95 (n=7) being dominant sequence types. In addition, 8 new sequence types (ST134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140 and 148) were identified. Of the 69 MRSP isolates, SCCmecV was the most prevalent type (n=33), followed by SCCmecVII (n=13), SCCmecII-III (n=7), and SCCmecIII (n=4). This study demonstrates for the first time that the occurrence of MRSP in healthy pets in China and shows that MRSP in South China has high genetic diversity.
