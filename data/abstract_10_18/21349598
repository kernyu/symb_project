The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence, antimicrobial resistance and molecular epidemiology of Campylobacter coli isolated from swine in China. A total of 190 C. coli isolates obtained from two slaughter houses and ten conventional pig farms in Shandong (SD, n=95) and Ningxia (NX, n=95) provinces were tested for their susceptibility to 14 antimicrobials. A high prevalence (>95%) of ciprofloxacin and tetracycline-resistant strains was observed in both SD and NX. The erythromycin and clindamycin resistance rates of C. coli from NX (ERY: 54.7% CLI: 43.2%) were higher than those from SD (ERY: 37.9%, CLI: 35.8%). A significant difference (P<0.05) was observed in erythromycin resistance rate, but not (P>0.05) in clindamycin resistance rate. while the resistance rates of ampicillin and kanamycin in NX (AMP: 34.7%, KAN: 43.2%) were significantly lower (P<0.05) than those in SD (AMP: 51.6%, KAN: 71.6%). None of the tested isolates were resistant to phenicols. The majority of the isolates from both provinces (SD: 80% and NX: 73.7%) showed multi-drug resistance profiles. The point mutations of A2075G in the 23S rRNA and C257T in the gyrA gene were detected in 98% (87/89) of macrolide resistant isolates and all ciprofloxacin resistant isolates, respectively. In addition, all tetracycline-resistant isolates harbored the tet(O) gene. The high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in C. coli strains derived from pigs in China was observed and was likely due to the extensive use of various antimicrobials. Prudent use of antimicrobial agents on farms should be further emphasized to control the dissemination of antimicrobial resistant C. coli.
