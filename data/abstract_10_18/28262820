In the last 40 years only one new antitubercular drug has been approved, whilst resistance to current drugs, including rifampicin, is spreading. Here, we used the model organism Mycobacterium smegmatis to study mechanisms of phenotypic mycobacterial resistance, employing quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics to investigate the temporal effects of sub-lethal concentrations of rifampicin on the mycobacterial proteome at time-points corresponding to early response, onset of bacteriostasis and early recovery. Across 18 samples, a total of 3,218 proteins were identified from 31,846 distinct peptides averaging 16,250 identified peptides per sample. We found evidence that two component signal transduction systems (e.g. MprA/MprB) play a major role during initial mycobacterial adaptive responses to sub-lethal rifampicin and that, after dampening an initial SOS response, the bacteria supress the DevR (DosR) regulon and also upregulate their transcriptional and translational machineries. Furthermore, we found a co-ordinated dysregulation in haeme and mycobactin synthesis. Finally, gradual upregulation of the M. smegmatis-specific rifampin ADP-ribosyl transferase was observed which, together with upregulation of transcriptional and translational machinery, likely explains recovery of normal growth. Overall, our data indicates that in mycobacteria, sub-lethal rifampicin triggers a concerted phenotypic response that contrasts significantly with that observed at higher antimicrobial doses.
