Most cases of acute otitis media (AOM) resolve even without antibiotic treatment. In the pre-antibiotic era, AOM complications were common and could lead to deafness and neurological sequelae. With the use of antibiotics, the complications have become less frequent, but they may still evolve. The possible increase in the occurrence of complications has to be considered if we start treating AOM more conservatively and if bacterial antibiotic resistance situation becomes more problematic. These rare but possibly lethal complications should be diagnosed and treated promptly. The need for cochlear implantation has to be evaluated soon after an episode of meningitis if deafness is suspected.
