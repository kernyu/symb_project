OBJECTIVE: To analyse the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Escherichia coli bacteraemia among cancer patients, and to assess the risk factors and outcomes of multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli bacteraemia. METHODS: The retrospective study was conducted at Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Lahore, and comprised medical records of patients with Escherichia coli bacteraemia presenting between December 2012 and November 2013. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to determine the factors associated with the development and 30-day mortality of multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli bacteraemia. RESULTS: Out of 1603 episodes of bacteraemia, 227(35.6%) were caused by E.coli, of which 98(43.2%) were multidrug-resistant. In multivariable analysis, age less than 18 years (adjusted odds ratio 3.92; 95% confidence interval 1.43-10.68), presence of central venous catheter (adjusted odds ratio 2.12; 95% confidence interval 1.04-4.33) and exposure to piperacillin/tazobactam within 90 days prior to infection (adjusted odds ratio 2.37; 95% confidence interval 1.15-4.86) were identified as independent risk factors for acquisition of multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli bacteraemia. The overall 30 day mortality rate was 35.2% (80/227). Risk factors for mortality were intensive care unit admission (adjusted odds ratio 3.95; 95% confidence interval 1.79-8.71) and profound neutropenia (adjusted odds ratio 4.03; 95% confidence interval 1.55-10.49). CONCLUSIONS: Bloodstream infections with multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli were common in cancer patients. However it was not a predictor of mortality.
