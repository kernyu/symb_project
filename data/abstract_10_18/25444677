The clinical effectiveness of Laninamivir octanoate hydrate (laninamivir) was investigated in the Japanese 2012-2013 influenza season for comparison with that of the Japanese 2011-2012 influenza season. A total of 235 patients were enrolled, of whom 210 were evaluated for the duration of fever and other symptoms. The median durations of fever for A(H3N2) were 32.0 and 38.0 h and the median durations of symptoms for the A(H3N2) were 102.0 and 84.0 h for patients aged under 10 and 10 years or older, respectively. All four influenza B patients were 10 years or older, and their median duration of fever was 43.0 h and the median duration of symptoms was 71.0 h. There was no significant difference in the duration of fever or symptoms between the two seasons. The rates of patients A(H3N2) virus positive at day 5 were 37.2% (16/43) and 12.8% (18/141) for those aged under 10 years and 10 years or older, respectively. The virus positive rate was significantly higher for the patients under 10 years than for the patients aged 10 years or older (p < 0.0001). No significant change in IC50 value was found between days 1 and 5. Adverse drug reactions were reported by 2 of the 231 patients (0.87%), but neither was serious. These results suggest that laninamivir continued to be effective against influenza A(H3N2) with no safety issues and that it is unlikely that the clinical use of laninamivir will lead to virus resistance.
