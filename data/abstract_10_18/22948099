BACKGROUND: Previous work has indicated that extracorporeal photochemotherapy (ECP) may be a safe and effective treatment in patients with severe atopic dermatitis. METHODS: We performed a prospective study to investigate the effect of a defined 20-week ECP protocol in patients with severe, refractory atopic dermatitis. The patient inclusion criteria included (i) disease duration of at least 1 year, (ii) SCORAD > 45, and (iii) resistance to first-line therapy, including topical steroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, and one form of phototherapy (UVA, UVB, or PUVA) or one second-line therapy, including systemic steroids or cyclosporine. Ten patients (4 women and 6 men; age range 29 to 61 years) were enrolled and treated with two sessions of standard ECP in 2-week intervals for 12 weeks and 4-week intervals thereafter until week 20. The patients' clinical status and response was determined by SCORAD at baseline and every 2 weeks, and quality of life was assessed every 4 weeks using SKINDEX, SF-36, and FACT scores. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant (p = 0.015) reduction of the mean SCORAD by 10.3 (95% CI, 2.5 to 18.0) from 64.8 at baseline to 54.5 (i.e., 15.9% reduction) at week 20. In a subset of patients (all of female sex), the relative reduction in SCORAD after ECP was more than 25% at week 20. Improvement in quality of life measured by SKINDEX, SF-36, and FACT did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: We detected a small but significant therapeutic effect of ECP in patients with severe, refractory atopic dermatitis.
