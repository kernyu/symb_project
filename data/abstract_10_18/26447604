Fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter jejuni isolates from broilers in Japan were characterized using multilocus sequence typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) in order to elucidate the genetic relationship between these strains. Forty-three of the isolates were classified into 20 sequence types and were clustered into 21 PFGE types with 70% similarity. The most dominant clonal complex (CC) was CC-21 (41.9%). Diverse PFGE patterns were observed within the same CC, but the combined analysis of PFGE type and CC revealed that the strains with the same combination were isolated from the same district or neighboring districts. On the other hand, strains with the same combination pattern were also isolated from geographically distant districts. Our results elucidate two possible reasons for the prevalence of fluoroquinolone-resistant C. jejuni among broiler farms: (1) the resistant C. jejuni is clonally disseminated within the limited area, and (2) susceptible C. jejuni acquired fluoroquinolone resistance during the use of fluoroquinolone on the farms.
