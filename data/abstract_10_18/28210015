INTRODUCTION: Dacryocystitis is an infection of lacremical sac due to obstruction of nasolacrimal duct which has primary or secondary causes. Idiopathic inflammatory obstruction is the primary cause. Trauma, infection, inflammation, neoplasia, and mechanical obstruction are secondary one. AIM: The objective of this study is determination of bacterial samples from patients with chronic acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was contained 90 patients with dacryocystitis from 2010 to 2011, in Besat hospital. Convenience sampling in sterile condition sampling was performed by sterile swab from the pus out of the lacrimal sac. Blood agar, EMB, chocolate agar, and thioglycolate broth were used for bacterial cultivation. Various antibiotics were used for antibiotic resistance study. Finally, statistical analysis was done by SPSS ver. 15. RESULTS: In this study, the mean age of participants was 49.36 +/- 12.18 years. Number of male and female patients was equal and Sampling was performed in 53.3% of patients from the right eye. The most frequent bacteria were Staphylococcus, E. coli, and Enterobacteriaceae, respectively. Also, our results show most of bacteria obtained from patients eye pus are sensitive to chloramphenicol and the most antibiotic resistance was for co-trimoxazole. CONCLUSION: Our results illustrated gram-positive bacteria have an important role in dacryocystitis which is confirm previous studies. Although our results indicated chloramphenicol is the best choice for treatment process, but it is notable due to the variety of bacteria which can cause this disease, identification of bacterial contamination can be a great help to choose the best treatment process.
