The presence of antibiotic residues in the environment has been regarded as an emerging concern due to their potential adverse environmental consequences such as antibiotic resistance. However, the interaction between antibiotics and extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) of biofilms in wastewater treatment systems is not entirely clear. In this study, the effect of ciprofloxacin (CIP) antibiotic on biofilm EPS matrix was investigated and characterized using fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) and parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis. Physicochemical analysis showed that the proteins were the major EPS fraction, and their contents increased gradually with an increase in CIP concentration (0-300 mug/L). Based on the characterization of biofilm tightly bound EPS (TB-EPS) by EEM, three fluorescent components were identified by PARAFAC analysis. Component C1 was associated with protein-like substances, and components C2 and C3 belonged to humic-like substances. Component C1 exhibited an increasing trend as the CIP addition increased. Pearson's correlation results showed that CIP correlated significantly with the protein contents and component C1, while strong correlations were also found among UV254, dissolved organic carbon, humic acids, and component C3. A combined use of EEM-PARAFAC analysis and chemical measurements was demonstrated as a favorable approach for the characterization of variations in biofilm EPS in the presence of CIP antibiotic.
