In addition to being an important mediator of migration and invasion of tumor cells, beta3 integrin can also enhance TGF-beta1 signaling. However, it is not known whether beta3 might influence the induction of metastatic phenotype of tumor cells, especially non-metastatic tumor cells which express low level of beta3. Here we report that H2O2 and HOCl, the reactive oxygen species produced by neutrophils, could cooperate with TGF-beta1 to induce metastatic phenotype of non-metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. TGF-beta1/H2O2/HOCl, but not TGF-beta1 or H2O2/HOCl, induced beta3 expression by triggering the enhanced activation of p38 MAPK. Intriguingly, beta3 in turn promoted TGF-beta1/H2O2/HOCl-mediated induction of metastatic phenotype of HCC cells by enhancing TGF-beta1 signaling. beta3 promoted TGF-beta1/H2O2/HOCl-induced expression of itself via positive feed-back effect on p38 MAPK activation, and also promoted TGF-beta1/H2O2/HOCl-induced expression of alpha3 and SNAI2 by enhancing the activation of ERK pathway, thus resulting in higher invasive capacity of HCC cells. By enhancing MAPK activation, beta3 enabled TGF-beta1 to augment the promoting effect of H2O2/HOCl on anoikis-resistance of HCC cells. TGF-beta1/H2O2/HOCl-induced metastatic phenotype was sufficient for HCC cells to extravasate from circulation and form metastatic foci in an experimental metastasis model in nude mice. Inhibiting the function of beta3 could suppress or abrogate the promoting effects of TGF-beta1/H2O2/HOCl on invasive capacity, anoikis-resistance, and extravasation of HCC cells. These results suggest that beta3 could function as a modulator to promote TGF-beta1/H2O2/HOCl-mediated induction of metastatic phenotype of non-metastatic tumor cells, and that targeting beta3 might be a potential approach in preventing the induction of metastatic phenotype of non-metastatic tumor cells.
