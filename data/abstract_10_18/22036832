The purposes of this study were to examine the impact of chlorhexidine on the transmission of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) on an inpatient oncology unit, compare the cost of 2 chlorhexidine bath delivery methods, and evaluate nursing time and satisfaction to administer the baths. MRSA and VRE transmission rates decreased from those during the previous years. Costs associated with bathing increased, but time to administer the bath decreased with the chlorhexidine cloths, and nursing staff reported satisfaction with their use.
