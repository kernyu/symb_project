INTRODUCTION: Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection is common and carries a significant risk for the development of cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The goal of treatment in patients with CHB-related decompensated cirrhosis is to improve hepatic dysfunction and reduce mortality through the inhibition of viral replication. Several studies have now shown nucleot(s)ide analogs to be safe and effective in decompensated cirrhosis due to CHB. AREAS COVERED: A review of the evidence for the use of entecavir in the treatment of decompensated hepatitis B cirrhosis is discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Entecavir is an effective treatment option for most patients with CHB. In treatment naive patients, it is a potent antiviral agent with a very low resistance rate, making it an excellent option for the treatment of decompensated hepatitis B cirrhosis. The use of entecavir monotherapy in patients with a known rtM204V lamivudine-resistant mutation should be avoided due to increased risk of developing entecavir resistance and failing treatment.
