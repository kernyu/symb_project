Salicylic acid (SA) acts as a signalling molecule in plant defence against biotrophic and hemibiotrophic phytopathogens. The biosynthesis of SA on pathogen detection is essential for local and systemic acquired resistance, as well as the accumulation of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins. SA biosynthesis can occur via several different substrates, but is predominantly accomplished by isochorismate synthase (ICS1) following pathogen recognition. The roles of BTB domain-containing proteins, NPR1, NPR3 and NPR4, in SA binding and signal transduction have been re-examined recently and are elaborated upon in this review. The pathogen-mediated manipulation of SA-dependent defences, as well as the crosstalk between the SA signalling pathway, other plant hormones and defence signals, is also discussed in consideration of recent research. Furthermore, the recent links established between SA, pathogen-triggered endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response are highlighted.
