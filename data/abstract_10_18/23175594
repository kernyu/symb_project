OBJECTIVES: To compare the abilities of doripenem and ciprofloxacin to restrict the enrichment of resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, multiple antibiotic dosing regimens were simulated in an in vitro model at comparable ratios of the 24 h AUC (AUC24) to the MIC. METHODS: Three clinical isolates of ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa (MIC of doripenem 1 mg/L, MIC of ciprofloxacin 4 mg/L) were exposed to thrice-daily doripenem or twice-daily ciprofloxacin for 3 days at AUC24/MIC ratios from 50 to 170 h (doripenem) and from 55 to 180 h (ciprofloxacin). RESULTS: Doripenem- and ciprofloxacin-resistant mutants were enriched at antibiotic concentrations that fell into the mutant selection window for >/= 45% and >/= 60% of the dosing interval, respectively. The anti-mutant effects of doripenem and ciprofloxacin expressed by the area under the bacterial mutant concentration-time curve (AUBCM) depended on the AUC24/MIC ratio, and the AUBCM-log AUC24/MIC relationships were antibiotic specific. CONCLUSION: Based on AUC24/MIC relationships with AUBCM, a greater anti-mutant potential was predicted for doripenem compared with ciprofloxacin.
