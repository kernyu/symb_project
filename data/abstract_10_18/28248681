INTRODUCTION: In this study, we aimed to identify risk factors for the development of infectious complications after prostate biopsy and to investigate the role of intestinal colonization of bacteria that are resistant to prophylactic antibiotics. METHODOLOGY: A total of 168 patients who had undergone transrectal prostate biopsy (TRPB) under ciprofloxacin and gentamycin prophylaxis were included in the study. Stool cultures and subsequent antibiotic susceptibility testing were performed in all patients before the start of antibiotic prophylaxis. RESULTS: Of the 168 patients, 17 (10.1%) developed urinary tract infection (UTI), while 6 (3.57%) developed sepsis within seven days after biopsy. Ciprofloxacin-resistant bacterial colonization was detected in 81 (48.2%) of the patients. None of the patients with ciprofloxacin-sensitive bacteria in intestinal flora developed a UTI. The colonization of intestinal ciprofloxacin-resistant bacteria increased UTI risk significantly after TRPB (p < 0.0001). Urolithiasis history, presence of permanent urinary catheterization, hospitalization history for more than 48 hours in the last year, and recent antibiotic usage significantly increased UTI risk after TRPB. CONCLUSIONS: Development of an infection was more frequent in patients with resistant bacterial colonization. We hope to guide more comprehensive studies designed to find a standard prophylactic regimen for TRPB that can be used all over the world.
