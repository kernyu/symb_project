Tomato plants transformed with a cDNA clone encoding the inhibitor-of-virus-replication (IVR) gene were partially resistant to Botrytis cinerea. This resistance was observed as a significant reduction in the size of lesions induced by the fungus in transgenic plants compared with the lesions on the nontransgenic control plants. This resistance was weakened when plants were kept at an elevated temperature, 32 degrees C, before inoculation with B. cinerea compared with plants kept at 17 to 22 degrees C prior to inoculation. Resistance correlated with the presence of IVR transcripts, as detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. This is one of the few cases in which a gene associated with resistance to a virus also seems to be involved in resistance to a fungal disease.
