Vancomycin is an antibiotic for exclusive hospital use administrated in intravenous infusion to treat systemic infections. It is mainly eliminated by kidneys and potentially nephrotoxic. Data available show that Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) of vancomycin is highly recommended. It aims to ensure efficacy and avoid resistance by maintaining trough plasma concentrations above the MIC. Secondary, vancomycine TDM may be indicated to prevent nephrotoxicity in high risk patients. TDM is often underwent at steady state (48 to 72 h after the treatment initiation) unless in case of renal impairment (24 h). While compared with intermittent administration, continuous infusion did not result in prognosis improvement; however it resulted in lower pharmacokinetic variability and better cost-efficiency. Targeted trough concentrations for intermittent infusion are between 15 and 20 mg/L (up to 25-30 mg/L for GISA). In case of continuous infusion, targets are higher (25 to 40 mg/L).
