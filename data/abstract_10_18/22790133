A 48-year-old man was admitted with cloudy dialysate and diagnosed as peritoneal dialysis (PD)-related peritonitis caused by Roseomonas infection. This is the third case of PD-related peritonitis due to Roseomonas species and also the first case of peritonitis in automated peritoneal dialysis. Despite its low virulence and rare incidence in peritoneal dialysis, clinicians should be alert to the possibility of Roseomonas infection due to its high resistance to antibiotics. Literature on Roseomonas infection is also reviewed. The current guidelines for empirical peritonitis in PD patients do not adequately cover such infection. Refractory treatment in high risk cases should alert clinicians to upgrade antibiotics even for a vague manifestation.
