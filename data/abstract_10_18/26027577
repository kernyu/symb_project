Tuberculosis (TB) is an airborne communicable disease, mainly caused by aerobic, non-motile, rodshaped, weakly gram-positive, acid-fast tubercular bacillus Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb). Mycobacterium has worsened the problem in humans by acquiring various types of resistances like Multi-drug resistance (MDR), Single-drug resistance (SDR), and Extensive drug resistance (XDR). Some clinical problems and challenges associated with conventional TB chemotherapy include poor patient compliance, longer duration of chemotherapy, lesser cell permeability, primary drug resistance, difficulty in maintaining higher drug concentrations at the infected site, and degradation of the drug before reaching the target site. Thus, newer micrometric or nanometric carriers drug delivery approaches are needed. Colloidal (vesicular and particulate) drug carriers offer numerous advantages over conventional therapy such as better systemic bioavailability, rapid onset of therapeutic action, avoidance of first-pass metabolism, providing sustained and controlled release, fewer dosing frequencies, desired pharmacokinetic prole and route of administration. This review article present updates and fabrication of drug delivery approaches for tuberculosis chemotherapy in order to improve patient compliance.
