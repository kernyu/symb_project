OBJECTIVE: Hepatitis C virus (HCV genome) polymorphisms are thought to influence the outcome of pegylated-interferon/ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV) therapy. This study aimed to examine non-structural protein 5A (NS5A) polymorphisms, e.g. IFN/RBV resistance-determining region (IRRDR) and IFN sensitivity-determining region (ISDR), and core protein polymorphism as predictive therapeutic markers. METHODS: Pretreatment sequences of NS5A and core regions were analyzed in 68 HCV-1b-infected patients treated with PEG-IFN/RBV. RESULTS: Of 24 patients infected withHCV having an IRRDR with 6 or more mutations (IRRDR>/=6), 18 (75%) patients achieved sustained virological response (SVR), whereas only 11 (25%) of 44 patients infected with HCV having IRRDR</=5 did. IRRDR>/=6 was significantly associated with SVR (p < 0.0001). On the other hand, ISDR>/=2 was significantly associated with relapse (either before [breakthrough] or after end-of-treatment response [ETR[-]relapse]) (p < 0.05) and a point mutation of the core protein from Arg to Gln at position 70 (Gln(70)) was significantly associated with null-response (p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis identified IRRDR>/=6 as the only viral genetic factor that independently predicted SVR. CONCLUSION: NS5A (IRRDR and ISDR) and core protein polymorphisms are associated with the outcome of PEG-IFN/RBV therapy for chronic hepatitis C. In particular, IRRDR>/=6 is a useful marker for prediction of SVR.
