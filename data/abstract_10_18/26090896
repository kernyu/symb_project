Phytochemical dereplication was undertaken on the bioactive crude CH2Cl2 extract of the bulbs of the Australian plant Haemodorum spicatum employing HPLC-NMR and HPLC-MS methodologies. Subsequent bioassay-guided isolation resulted in the identification of two new phenylphenalenones [haemoxiphidone (8) and haemodoronol (17)] and two new chromenes [haemodordione (13) and haemodordiol (16)], together with seven previously described compounds. Antimicrobial testing showed that the compounds displayed selective antibacterial activity. Most noteworthy were the activities displayed by several of the compounds against multi-drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
