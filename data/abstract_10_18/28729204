OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and molecular characteristics of clinical oxacillin-susceptible mecA-positive Staphylococcus aureus (OS-MRSA) isolates in China from July 2009 to June 2014. METHODS: A total of 2068 non-duplicate S. aureus isolates were collected from 21 hospitals. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the agar dilution method. All OS-MRSA strains were screened for the presence of the genes mecA, mecC and nuc as well as the Panton-Valentine leukocidin gene (pvl). Staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing, staphylococcal protein A (spa) typing and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were performed to analyse the isolate genotypes. RESULTS: A total of 34 S. aureus isolates were mecA-positive but were susceptible to oxacillin [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)</=2mg/L]. All OS-MRSA isolates were resistant to cefoxitin and most were also multiresistant to other antibiotics besides beta-lactams. Among the 34 OS-MRSA isolates, nine spa and three SCCmec types were detected and, combined with MLST, ST338/59-t437-SCCmecV (47%; 16/34) was the predominant clone. In addition, 17 strains (50%) carried the pvl gene. CONCLUSIONS: The most frequent clone of OS-MRSA isolates in China was ST338-t437-SCCmecV. Most of the OS-MRSA isolates were susceptible to the majority of antibacterial agents except macrolides, clindamycin and chloramphenicol.
