Activity of mitochondrial ATP-dependent potassium channel in rats with high genetically determined resistance to hypoxia was higher than in sensitive animals. Adaptation of low resistant rats to hypoxia was accompanied by activation of the channel, facilitation of potassium recycling in mitochondria, and a decrease in the rate of H2O2 formation. Our results indicate that mitochondrial ATP-dependent potassium channel plays an important role in the delayed mechanisms of animal's adaptation to hypoxia.
