BACKGROUND: Chronic HIV infection is associated with low-level inflammation and increased risk of chronic diseases and mortality. The objective was to assess the effects of moderate intensity exercise on metabolic and inflammatory markers in HIV-infected treated persons. METHODS: This was a pilot study enrolling cART-treated, sedentary persons with metabolic complications in a 12-week protocol, consisting of three sessions per week of 60 min brisk walking with (strength-walk group) or without (walk group) 30 min circuit-training. Assessments at baseline and week 12 (W12) included body morphometrics and total body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry; lipid and glucose blood profile; plasma level of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), D-dimer, interleukin-18 (IL-18), soluble CD14, and CD38 and HLA-DR expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients were included and 35 (71%) completed the program: 21 in the walk and 14 in the strength-walk group. At W12, significant improvements were observed of body mass index, waist and hip circumference, and total cholesterol both overall and in the walk group, and of LDL cholesterol in both training groups. In the whole group, significant reductions were observed in hsCRP, IL-6, D-dimer, IL-18, and of CD8+/CD38+/HLA-DR+ cell frequencies. HsCRP and CD8+/CD38+/HLA-DR+ frequency decreased significantly in both training groups when examined separately whereas IL-6 and D-dimer in the walk group only. CONCLUSIONS: Brisk walking, with or without strength exercise, could improve lipid profile and inflammatory markers in chronic HIV infection.
