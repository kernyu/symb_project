BACKGROUND: The Xpert MTB/RIF assay has been recommended by WHO to replace conventional microscopy, culture, and drug resistance tests. It simultaneously detects both Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (TB) and resistance to rifampicin (RIF) within two hours. The objective was to review the available research studies on the accuracy of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay for diagnosing pulmonary TB and RIF-resistance in children. METHODS: A comprehensive search of Pubmed and Embase was performed up to October 28, 2014. We identified published articles estimating the diagnostic accuracy of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay in children with or without HIV using culture or culture plus clinical TB as standard reference. QUADAS-2 tool was used to evaluate the quality of the studies. A summary estimation for sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratios (DOR), and the area under the summary ROC curve (AUC) was performed. Meta-analysis was used to establish the overall accuracy. RESULTS: 11 diagnostic studies with 3801 patients were included in the systematic review. The overall analysis revealed a moderate sensitivity and high specificity of 65% (95% CI: 61 - 69%) and 99% (95% CI: 98 - 99%), respectively, and a pooled diagnostic odds ratio of 164.09 (95% CI: 111.89 - 240.64). The AUC value was found to be 0.94. The pooled sensitivity and specificity for paediatric rifampicin resistance were 94.0% (95% CI: 80.0 - 93.0%) and 99.0% (95% CI: 95.0 - 98.0%), respectively. Hence, the Xpert MTB/RIF assay has good diagnostic and rifampicin performance for paediatric pulmonary tuberculosis. CONCLUSIONS: The Xpert MTB/RIF is sensitive and specific for diagnosing paediatric pulmonary TB. It is also effective in detecting rifamnicin resistance. It can, therefore, be used as an initial diagnostic tool.
