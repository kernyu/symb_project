BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Eradication rate of Helicobacter pylori decreases worldwide, while antibiotics resistance rates of H. pylori increase rapidly in recent years. In most cases, H. pylori would be resistant to clarithromycin, metronidazole, and quinolone if these antibiotics had been used as component of eradication regimen. H. pylori strains resistant to both tetracycline and furazolidone are rare. The aim of our study was to evaluate efficacy and side effects of tetracycline- and furazolidone-containing quadruple regimen as rescue treatment. METHODS: Patients with H. pylori infection given RTFB (rabeprazole 20 mg b.i.d. + tetracycline 750 mg b.i.d. +furazolidone 100 mg b.i.d. + colloidal bismuth subcitrate 200 mg b.i.d.) regimen for 14 days as rescue treatment were enrolled in this retrospective study. Eradication status was evaluated by (13) C-urea breath test, and side effects were collected. RESULTS: One hundred and nine patients were enrolled. The intention-to-treat eradication rate was 91.74% (100 of 109) and 95.24% (100 of 105) per protocol analysis. Side effects including fever, palpitation, and skin rash occurred in 35 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The 14-day tetracycline- and furazolidone-containing quadruple regimen can achieve a relatively high eradication rate as rescue treatment. Some side effects including fever may occur during the treatment.
