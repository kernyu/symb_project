Due to the excessive use of antibiotics over the years, the microorganisms have developed resistance to numerous drugs. The growth of multi-resistant organisms (MROs) heads due to the insufficient treatment with the currently available medications which present a great threat to the biotic component of the environment as well as to the food technology sectors. The goal of this research was to develop a nano-composite made up of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and amine-functionalized porphyrin, which could further be used for the anti-microbial studies in presence of visible light showing photodynamic effect to inactivate cells. Photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy is gaining significant interest due to its capabilities as an innovative form of antimicrobial treatment. The development of anti-microbial photodynamic therapy (a-PDT) is a non-antibiotic access to inactivate microorganisms. We examined the synthesis of amine-functionalized porphyrin and conjugated it to the oxidised single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). By the use of appropriate amount of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), we have shown the interaction between the porphyrin conjugated nanotubes and the bacterial cells in presence of visible light led to the cell membrane damage, concluding that SWCNT-porphyrin conjugates can be used as an antibacterial agent. The characterization of the oxidised SWCNT and SWCNT-porphyrin conjugates was determined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), which provides detailed information about the composition and the morphological analysis. The particle size measurements were carried out by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). On investigating under the florescence microscopy, red fluorescence was observed. Thus, these properties demand us to design this facile material comprised of SWCNT-aminoporphyrin conjugates that shows potent antibacterial activity.
