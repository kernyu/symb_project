BACKGROUND: Diarrheagenic Escherichia coli (DEC) is a major cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in children. Also, antibiotic resistance among DEC is becoming a critical area of concern in clinical settings. METHODS: This study was conducted in 4 hospitals in Shanghai from June 2012 to October 2013. DEC isolates from stool samples of patients with diarrhea were examined to determine their antimicrobial susceptibilities and presence of virulence genes, in order to identify high risk clones. RESULTS: A total of 735 (10.2%) DEC isolates were identified from 7204 stool samples from patients with diarrhea, including 374 enteropathogenic E. coli, 318 enterotoxigenic E. coli, 36 Shigella/enteroinvasive E. coli and 7 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC). Among the 735 DEC isolates, 299 (40.7%) were isolated from children less than 5 years old. High resistance rates were observed to streptomycin (90.7%), ampicillin (63.4%), nalidixic acid (61.1%), sulfisoxazole (49.1%), tetracycline (41.2%), trimethoprim (35.6%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (35.4%), followed by amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (27.2%), cefotaxime (24.5%), cefepime (23.5%), gentamicin (16.7%), ceftazidime (12.4%), chloramphenicol (10.6%), ciprofloxacin (7.2%) and ofloxacin (3.4%). All the isolates were susceptible to imipenem. In addition, potential virulence genes were screened by polymerase chain reaction. A total of 15 enterotoxigenic E. coli belonging to the same clone were identified to be associated with nosocomial neonatal diarrhea and resistant to greater than 10 antimicrobials. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that active surveillance programs combining both phenotypic and genetic data would help identify disease outbreaks and strengthen antibiotic management.
