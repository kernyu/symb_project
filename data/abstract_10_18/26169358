The spread of resistance of malaria infections to artemisinin is a major concern for the future. The Plasmodium falciparum phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PfPI3K) may be a potential target of artemisinin and effector of resistance. This could be mediated by the Kelch13 protein, the molecular marker of resistance that modulates PfPI3K ubiquitination.
