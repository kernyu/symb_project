UNLABELLED: beta-lapachone (beta-lap), an NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) targeting antitumor drug candidate in phase II clinical trials, is metabolically eliminated via NQO1 mediated quinone reduction and subsequent UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) catalyzed glucuronidation. This study intends to explore the inner link between the cellular glucuronidation and pharmacokinetics of beta-lap and its apoptotic effect in human colon cancer cells. HT29 cells S9 fractions exhibited high glucuronidation activity towards beta-lap, which can be inhibited by UGT1A9 competitive inhibitor propofol. UGT1A siRNA treated HT29 cells S9 fractions displayed an apparent low glucuronidation activity. Intracellular accumulation of beta-lap in HCT116 cells was much higher than that in HT29 cells, correlated with the absence of UGT1A in HCT116 cells. The cytotoxic and apoptotic effect of beta-lap in HT29 cells were much lower than that in HCT116 cells; moreover, beta-lap triggered activation of SIRT1-FOXO1 apoptotic pathway was observed in HCT116 cells but not in HT29 cells. Pretreatment of HT29 cells with UGT1A siRNA or propofol significantly decreased beta-lap's cytotoxic and apoptotic effects, due to the repression of glucuronidation and the resultant intracellular accumulation. In conclusion, UGT1A is an important determinant, via switching NQO1-triggered redox cycle to metabolic elimination, in the intracellular accumulation of beta-lap and thereafter its cytotoxicity in human colon cancer cells. Together with our previous works, we propose that UGTs determined cellular pharmacokinetics is an important determinant in the apoptotic effects of NQO1 targeting substrates serving as chemotherapeutic drugs.
