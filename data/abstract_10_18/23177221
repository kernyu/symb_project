Thirteen NDM-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae, representing all carbapenem-resistant strains (5.2% overall) collected in 3 Indian hospitals during 2010, were analyzed. Eleven genetically distinct strains of 4 bacterial species were observed. All 3 E. coli strains belonged to ST101. Strains harbored bla(CTX-M-15) and at least 1 other beta-lactamase. Fluoroquinolone and aminoglycoside resistance genes were detected in 11 and 6 strains, respectively. bla(NDM-1) was carried in plasmids of various sizes and incompatibility types, and 3 were transferred by conjugation. This study confirms the ability of bla(NDM-1) to disseminate among different bacterial species and the genetic variability of the structures carrying this metallo-beta-lactamase gene in India.
