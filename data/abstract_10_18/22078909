This study updates the activity of telavancin against Gram-positive pathogens collected from USA hospitals (2007-2009). Telavancin (MIC(50/90), 0.12/0.25 mug/mL) was active against coagulase-negative staphylococci and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (100% susceptible), for which only daptomycin (MIC(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mug/mL; 99% susceptible) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (MIC(50/90), </= 0.25-0.5/0.5 mug/mL; 99% susceptible) exhibited similar activity. Telavancin (MIC(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mug/mL) inhibited 96.5% of Enterococcus faecalis at the Food and Drug Administration breakpoint (MIC, </= 1 mug/mL), where ampicillin (99.9% susceptible), daptomycin (99.9% susceptible), and linezolid (100% susceptible) also demonstrated high-level coverage. Telavancin inhibited, respectively, 100.0% and 91.7% of VanB-phenotype E. faecalis and E. faecium at </= 1 mug/mL, whereas it was less active against VanA strains. Telavancin was uniformly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae and resistant subsets, and demonstrated good potency (MIC(90), 0.06-0.12 mug/mL) against other streptococci, regardless of resistance to other drugs. This assessment reveals potent activity of telavancin against Gram-positive isolates collected from USA hospitals with no evidence of emergence of resistance.
