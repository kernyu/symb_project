Many currently used antibiotics suffer from issues such as systemic toxicity, short half-life, and increased susceptibility to bacterial resistance. Although most antibiotic classes are administered systemically through oral or intravenous routes, a more efficient delivery system is needed. This review discusses the chemical conjugation of antibiotics to polymers, achieved by forming covalent bonds between antibiotics and a pre-existing polymer or by developing novel antibiotic-containing polymers. Through conjugating antibiotics to polymers, unique polymer properties can be taken advantage of. These polymeric antibiotics display controlled, sustained drug release and vary in antibiotic class type, synthetic method, polymer composition, bond lability, and antibacterial activity. The polymer synthesis, characterization, drug release, and antibacterial activities, if applicable, will be presented to offer a detailed overview of each system.
