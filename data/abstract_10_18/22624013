IL-12 and IL-23 regulate innate and adaptive immunity to microbial pathogens through influencing the expression of IFN-gamma, IL-17, and IL-22. Herein we define the roles of IL-12 and IL-23 in regulating host resistance and intestinal inflammation during acute Salmonella infection. We find that IL-23 alone is dispensable for protection against systemic spread of bacteria, but synergizes with IL-12 for optimal protection. IL-12 promotes the production of IFN-gamma by NK cells, which is required for resistance against Salmonella and also for induction of intestinal inflammation and epithelial injury. In contrast, IL-23 controls the severity of inflammation by inhibiting IL-12A expression, reducing IFN-gamma and preventing excessive mucosal injury. Our studies demonstrate that IL-23 is a homeostatic regulator of IL-12-dependent, IFN-gamma-mediated intestinal inflammation.
