The aim of this study is to investigate whether galanin (GAL) central receptors are involved in regulation of insulin resistance. To test it, a GAL antagonist, M35 was intracerebroventricularly administrated in trained type 2 diabetic rats. The euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp test was conducted for an index of glucose infusion rates. The epididymal fat pads were processed for determination of glucose uptake and Glucose Transporter 4 (GLUT4) amounts. The Gal mRNA expression levels in hypothalamus were quantitatively assessed too. We found an inhibitory effect of M35 on glucose uptake into adipocytes, Gal mRNA expression levels in hypothalamus, glucose infusion rates in the clamp test and GLUT4 concentration in plasma membranes and total cell membranes of adipocytes. The ratios of GLUT4 contents of the former to the latter in M35 groups were lower. These results suggest a facilitating role for GAL on GLUT4 translocation and insulin sensitivity via its central receptors in rats.
