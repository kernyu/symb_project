Chagas disease is a tropical disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which is endemic in Central and South America. Few treatments are available with effectiveness limited to the early (acute) stage of disease, significant toxicity and widespread drug resistance. In this work we report the outcome of a HTS-ready assay chemical library screen to identify novel, nontoxic, small-molecule inhibitors of T. cruzi. We have selected 50 compounds that possess hydrazone as a common group. The compounds were screened using recombinant T. cruzi (Tulahuen strain) expressing beta-galactosidase. A 3D quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis was performed using descriptors calculated from comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA). Our findings show that of the fifty selected hydrazones, compounds LpQM-19, 28 and 31 displayed the highest activity against T. cruzi, leading to a selectivity index (SI) of 20-fold. The 3D-QSAR analysis indicates that a particular electrostatic arrangement, where electron-deficient atoms are aligned along the molecule main axis positively correlates with compound biological activity. These results provide new candidate molecules for the development of treatments against Chagas disease.
