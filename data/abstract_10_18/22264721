Breast cancer is commonly treated by various combinations of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and hormone therapy. Most cancers either are increasingly resistant to any initial treatment or acquire resistance to a broad spectrum of anticancer drugs over time. Combination of more than one drug or combination with multidrug resistance (MDR) modifiers will possibly support the efficiency of the applied therapy. Understanding the MDR mechanisms in malignancies is crucial for developing novel strategies for treatment. The main goal of our study was to determine the cytostatic effect of doxorubicin in combination with phenothiazine derivatives (PD; promazine and triflupromazine) in doxorubicin-sensitive (MCF-7/WT) and -resistant (MCF-7/DOX) human breast adenocarcinoma cell lines. We determined cytotoxicity of the investigated compounds (MTT assay) after 24 and 48 h. The effect of phenothiazine derivatives was evaluated and doxorubicin localization was performed using confocal microscopy. The mode of the cell death was examined by the comet assay. We also determined the expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which is a membrane-associated protein responsible for the multidrug resistance.
