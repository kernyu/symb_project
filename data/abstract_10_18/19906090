Combination treatment of paediatric invasive fungal infections (IFIs) has rarely been reported. A total of 17 children with 19 IFI episodes were enrolled in the study. The median age of the patients was 5.3 (range 0.5-17) years. IFI was classified as proven in 4, probable in 12 and possible in 3 episodes. These patients received empiric antifungal treatment, which consisted of liposomal amphotericin B (LAmB) monotherapy for a median duration of 12 days (range 3-69 days). All patients were refractory to LAmB; therefore, caspofungin was added to the therapy in 11 patients. In the remaining six patients, LAmB was ceased and a combination of caspofungin and voriconazole was started. Among the patients who received caspofungin + LAmB, four did not show favourable response and the combination was switched to caspofungin + voriconazole. The median (range) and total duration of the therapy were 7 (3-14) days and 91 patient days for LAmB + caspofungin combination and 49 (7-126) days and 516 patient days for caspofungin + voriconazole combination. We found a favourable response rate of 68.4% in 16 proven or probable IFI episodes. Twelve-week survival rate of these patients was 75%. No serious side effect was observed among the patients. Our data suggest that combination antifungal therapy is safe and effective in children with haematological malignancies.
