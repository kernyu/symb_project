This original study suggests that alterations observed on tegumental structure and egg quality of adult Schistosoma mansoni harvested from TS mice are due to their high immune tolerogenic and low-inflammatory capacity. The tegument of worms harvested from genetically selected mice for extreme phenotypes of immune oral tolerance, resistance (TR) and susceptibility (TS) were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Parasites recovered from TR mice showed no tegumental morphological changes. However, specimens collected from TS mice exhibited tubercle swelling with blunted and shortened spines in lower density. These tegumental alterations were similar to those described with artemether or praziquantel treatment, but without to affecting the worm surveillance, supporting observations that the host immune system influences the development and function of the tegument of worms harbored in non-antihelminthic treated TS mice. TS mice showed a higher percentage of dead eggs and a lower percentage of immature eggs than TR mice, but had similar quantities of collected eggs. This suggests that in TS mice the alterations in adult worm tegument prevented egg development, but not egg production or worm survival. These results corroborate our previous scanning electron microscopy (SEM) study indicating the influence of the host immune regulatory profile on the development and function of the worm's reproductive system and tegument.
