INTRODUCTION: Influenza viruses are common agents of flu outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics that have occurred through the centuries. Prevention and control of flu are of great clinical importance, since they cause serious damage to health, with a consequent impact on quality of life and economy of a country. Resistance against the current drugs justifies the development of new anti-influenza molecules. Flavonoids exhibit significant activity against flu through their anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties. The profile of these molecules makes them particularly promising as therapeutic agents against flu. AREAS COVERED: This review focus on the activity of flavonoids on different influenza virus targets as well as their use in patented pharmaceutical formulations. Twenty-one patents of these compounds for prophylaxis and treatment of influenza infection are discussed. EXPERT OPINION: The H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009 resulted in a significant increase in the number of patents claiming pharmaceutical formulations for prophylaxis and treatment of flu. The research advances on flavonoids showing anti-influenza activity and the efforts made by researchers and industries consolidate the interest on new alternatives for the therapy of an infectious disease that represents a serious public health problem throughout the world.
