In an effort to rapidly access vancomycin analogues bearing diverse functionality at the 6c-Cl (the 'in-chloride') position, a two-step dechlorination/cross-coupling protocol was developed. Conditions for efficient cross-coupling of the relatively unreactive 6c-Cl group were found that ensure high conversion with minimal product decomposition. A set of 2c-dechloro-6c-functionalized vancomycin derivatives was prepared, and antibiotic activities of the compounds were evaluated against a panel of vancomycin-resistant and vancomycin-susceptible strains. Results from biological testing further underscore the steric sensitivity of vancomycin's binding pocket.
