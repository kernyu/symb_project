Gonorrhoea incidence in Sweden continued to increase during 2007-2011, while for syphilis, there was a very minor decrease, but no clear trend. Gonorrhoea incidence increased most among heterosexually infected men and women while for syphilis, the major burden was among men who have sex with men. Neisseria gonorrhoeae resistance to first-line antimicrobials increased annually. Surveillance of infection and antimicrobial resistance along with continuous analysis are needed, to develop prevention activities to reduce risk behaviours.
