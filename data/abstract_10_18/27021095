Genotyping and analysis the drug resistance of 59 isolates of M. tuberculosis obtained from patients living in Altai Territory were performed using a BACTEC MGIT 960 fluorometric system by means of VNTR typing (variable number tandem repeat), PCR-RFLP analysis, and sequence analysis. The occurrence frequency was highest for isolates of the Beijing family (n=30, 50.8%). Analysis of mutation spectrum in the rpoB gene associated with rifampicin resistance revealed the major mutation (codon 531 of the rpoB gene) in 93% samples, which allows us to use rapid test systems.
