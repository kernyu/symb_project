Fluconazole is the first line of therapy for the management of candidiasis. However, fluconazole-resistant strains pose an emerging challenge in everyday clinical practice. In this study, we sought to determine whether cumulative length of hospital stay (CLOS) is a predictive factor for the acquisition of non-susceptible Candida strains to fluconazole. Thirty-three critically ill emergency surgery patients with 56 Candida isolates were enrolled in this prospective study. We divided our isolates according to their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to fluconazole using 8 mcg/ml as a cutoff. We then compared the two groups with respect to basic demographics, antifungal agents prescribed, number of wide-spectrum antibiotics, duration of central venous catheter placement, elapsed time to positive culture, duration of prior hospital stay, and length of hospital stay. Non-susceptible fluconazole samples belonged to patients with a significantly longer prior hospital stay and a longer CLOS (P = 0.02 and 0.01, respectively). The difference between the 2 groups regarding non-albicans strains was statistically significant (P < 0.001). By fitting a non-parametric receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve into our analysis, a CLOS >/= 29 days predicted the occurrence of non-susceptible strains with 90% sensitivity and 79.6% specificity (correct classification 81.5%). A CLOS >/= 29 days is a strong predictor for the isolation of non-susceptible Candida isolates to fluconazole among critically ill emergency surgery patients. Clinicians should consider the duration of previous hospital stay when deciding on empiric antifungal therapy.
