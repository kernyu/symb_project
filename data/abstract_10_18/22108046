Maize seeds were used to identify the key embryo proteins involved in desiccation tolerance during development and germination. Immature maize embryos (28N) during development and mature embryos imbibed for 72 h (72HN) are desiccation sensitive. Mature maize embryos (52N) during development are desiccation tolerant. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substance and hydrogen peroxide contents decreased and increased with acquisition and loss of desiccation tolerance, respectively. A total of 111 protein spots changed significantly (1.5 fold increase/decrease) in desiccation-tolerant and -sensitive embryos before (28N, 52N and 72HN) and after (28D, 52D and 72HD) dehydration. Nine pre-dominantly proteins, 17.4 kDa Class I heat shock protein 3, late embryogenesis abundant protein EMB564, outer membrane protein, globulin 2, TPA:putative cystatin, NBS-LRR resistance-like protein RGC456, stress responsive protein, major allergen Bet v 1.01C and proteasome subunit alpha type 1, accumulated during embryo maturation, decreased during germination and increased in desiccation-tolerant embryos during desiccation. Two proteins, Rhd6-like 2 and low-molecular-weight heat shock protein precursor, showed the inverse pattern. We infer that these eleven proteins are involved in seed desiccation tolerance. We conclude that desiccation-tolerant embryos make more economical use of their resources to accumulate protective molecules and antioxidant systems to deal with maturation drying and desiccation treatment.
