By targeting the erm(41) and rrl genes in the Mycobacterium abscessus group, a multiplex real-time PCR assay for clarithromycin resistance showed 95% (38/40) concordance with nucleic acid testing and 95% (37/39) concordance with phenotypic testing. This assay provides a simple and rapid alternative to extended incubation or erm(41) sequencing.
