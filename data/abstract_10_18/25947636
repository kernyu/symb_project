Clinicians treating an infection assess a patient in terms of disease manifestation, causative organism and available antibiotic options with the aim of devising a therapeutic strategy under the creed of 'first, do no harm'. It is often only when treatment is failing or options are limited, as in the scenario of multidrug-resistant organisms, that consideration is given to the interplay that occurs between the microbe and the host. The emergence of Staphylococcus aureus with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin provides a prime example of these dynamic interactions. This review shall explore these concepts in relation to vancomycin for the treatment of methicillin-resistant S. aureus, with the aim of providing an informed approach to the utilization of this drug.
