The objective of this study was to investigate the risk of attenuated efficacy due to adaptive resistance for the siderophore-conjugated monocarbam SMC-3176 in Pseudomonas aeruginosa by using a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) approach. MICs were determined in cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB) and in Chelex-treated, dialyzed MHB (CDMHB). Spontaneous resistance was assessed at 2x to 16x the MIC and the resulting mutants sequenced. Efficacy was evaluated in a neutropenic mouse thigh model at 3.13 to 400 mg/kg of body weight every 3 h for 24 h and analyzed for association with free time above the MIC (fT>MIC). To closer emulate the conditions of the in vivo model, we developed a novel assay testing activity mouse whole blood (WB). All mutations were found in genes related to iron uptake: piuA, piuC, pirR, fecI, and pvdS. Against four P. aeruginosa isolates, SMC-3176 displayed predictable efficacy corresponding to the fT>MIC using the MIC in CDMHB (R(2) = 0.968 to 0.985), with stasis to 2-log kill achieved at 59.4 to 81.1%. Efficacy did not translate for P. aeruginosa isolate JJ 4-36, as the in vivo responses were inconsistent with fT>MIC exposures and implied a threshold concentration that was greater than the MIC. The results of the mouse WB assay indicated that efficacy was not predictable using the MIC for JJ 4-36 and four additional isolates, against which in vivo failures of another siderophore-conjugated beta-lactam were previously reported. SMC-3176 carries a risk of attenuated efficacy in P. aeruginosa due to rapid adaptive resistance preventing entry via the siderophore-mediated iron uptake systems. Substantial in vivo testing is warranted for compounds using the siderophore approach to thoroughly screen for this in vitro-in vivo disconnect in P. aeruginosa.
