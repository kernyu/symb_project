A rapid test to detect methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus through the penicillin-binding protein 2a antigen was introduced for pediatric patients hospitalized for purulent skin and soft tissue infections. Integration of this test with physician education and stewardship guidance improved targeted antibiotic use for infections caused by methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (44%-80%, P < 0.001), including when final culture results were not available.
