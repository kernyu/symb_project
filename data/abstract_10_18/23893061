BACKGROUND: Vancomycin resistant enterococcal bloodstream infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. AIM OF THE REVIEW: A search of the literature was undertaken to determine the optimal antimicrobial therapy for the management of vancomycin resistant enterococcal bloodstream infections. METHOD: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (unrestricted to time or language) were searched for studies of vancomycin resistant enterococcal bloodstream infections in adults reporting outcomes of direct comparisons of linezolid versus daptomycin on November 26, 2012. Studies of basic science, reviews, commentaries, pharmacologic, epidemiologic, or pediatric studies, and those studies examining conditions other than enterococcal bacteremia, a single antimicrobial agent or other antimicrobials were excluded. RESULTS: 226 studies were screened for eligibility and yielded eight studies evaluating a total of 807 patients. Inter-rater agreement was 100 %. Qualitative evaluation of the studies was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. No randomized controlled trials were identified. All studies were retrospective cohorts and non-randomized. 458 (57 %) patients treated with linezolid and 349 (43 %) with daptomycin were analyzed. Variable comorbidities and severity of illness were described in the included studies and reported here for comparison. CONCLUSION: The optimal treatment of vancomycin resistant enterococcal bloodstream infections is yet to be determined. Well-designed prospective studies are needed to lend more convincing evidence regarding choice of antimicrobial therapy for this important multidrug resistant organism.
