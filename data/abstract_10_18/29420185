BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance is an important public health issue globally and in Canada. To understand the current state of antimicrobial stewardship programs in Ontario health care facilities, Public Health Ontario conducted a voluntary survey of hospitals in the province. METHODS: The Ontario Antimicrobial Stewardship Program Landscape Survey was distributed online to hospitals, targeting front-line antimicrobial stewardship clinicians. The survey was open for 5 weeks in fall 2016. We used email and telephone reminders to encourage response. We performed descriptive and inferential statistical analyses at an aggregate level and by hospital type. Mental health and ambulatory sites were excluded. RESULTS: The response rate was 74.0% (97/131 organizations). Of the 97, 90 (93%) reported having a formal antimicrobial stewardship program or were in the process of implementing a formal program. Just over half (50 [56%]) identified appropriate antibiotic use as part of the organization's quality-improvement plan, strategic goal or priority. Half (45 [50%]) of programs did not have designated resources; those that did are underresourced with respect to physician and pharmacist staffing. The scope of implementation of program strategies was variable. Fifty hospitals (56%) reported tracking antimicrobial expenditures, 47 (52%) reported tracking defined daily dose, and 35 (39%) reported tracking days of therapy. INTERPRETATION: Most Ontario hospitals have a formal antimicrobial stewardship program, but there are opportunities for improvement. Future efforts should increase the priority of and improve resource allocation for antimicrobial stewardship programs so that programs can continue to grow in scope and impact.
