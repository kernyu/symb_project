Onychomycosis is a common superficial fungal infection, which usually caused by dermatophytes, yeast and non-dermatophytic moulds. Recently, we isolated a Rhodotorula minuta isolate from a 15-year-old immunocompetent girl student in Hangzhou (China) that was identified using microscopy, culture morphology, histological diagnosis, API 20C AUX Yeast Identification Kit and sequencing of the Internal Transcribed Spacer region. In vitro, antifungal susceptibility tests showed that this yeast isolate was susceptible to low concentrations of amphotericin B, itraconazole, voriconazole and 5-flvoriconaz but that it appeared to be dose-dependent susceptible to fluconazole(MIC = 16 mug/ml). Furthermore, the effective result of therapy with itraconazole against R. minuta was consistent with that of susceptibility tests.
