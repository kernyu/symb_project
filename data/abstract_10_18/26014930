We evaluated the combination of posaconazole with amphotericin B in vitro and in a murine model of systemic infections caused by Sporothrix brasiliensis and Sporothrix schenckii sensu stricto. In vitro data demonstrated a synergistic effect, and although posaconazole alone was effective against sporotrichosis, efficacy in terms of survival and burden reduction was increased with the combination. This combination might be an option against disseminated sporotrichosis, especially when itraconazole or amphotericin B at optimal doses are contraindicated.
