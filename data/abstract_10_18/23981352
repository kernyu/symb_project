ATP-binding cassette transporter G2/breast cancer resistance protein (ABCG2/BCRP) mediates drug-drug interactions that affect the secretion of drugs into milk. The aims of this study were: (1) to determine whether the major plasma metabolites of the flukicide triclabendazole (TCBZ), triclabendazole sulfoxide (TCBZSO) and triclabendazole sulfone (TCBZSO2), inhibit ovine and bovine ABCG2 and its Y581S variant in vitro, and (2) to examine whether coadministration of TCBZ with the ABCG2 substrates danofloxacin (a fluoroquinolone) and moxidectin (a milbemycin) affects the secretion of these drugs into the milk of sheep. TCBZSO and TCBZSO2 inhibited ruminant ABCG2 in vitro by reversing the reduced mitoxantrone accumulation and reducing basal to apical transport of nitrofurantoin in cells transduced with bovine variants (S581 and Y581) and the ovine variant of ABCG2. Coadministration of TCBZ with moxidectin or danofloxacin to sheep resulted in significantly reduced levels of moxidectin, but not danofloxacin, in the milk of TCBZ-treated sheep compared to sheep administered moxidectin or danofloxacin alone. The milk area under concentration time curve (AUC 0-48 h) was 2.99+/-1.41 mug h/mL in the group treated with TCBZ and moxidectin, and 7.75+/-3.58 mug h/mL in the group treated with moxidectin alone. The AUC (0-48 h) milk/plasma ratio was 37% lower in the group treated with TCBZ and moxidectin (7.34+/-1.51) than in the group treated with moxidectin alone (11.68+/-3.61). TCBZ metabolites appear to inhibit ruminant ABCG2 and affect the secretion of ABCG2 substrates into milk of sheep.
