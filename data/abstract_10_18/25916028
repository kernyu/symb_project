INTRODUCTION: The choice of antimicrobial treatment for septicemia is often empirical and based on the knowledge of local anti-microbial activity patterns of the most common bacteria causing such bloodstream infections. The current study aimed to study the prevalence of bacterial pathogens causing septicemia and their antimicrobial resistant profiles in hospital admitted patients. METHODS: This cross sectional study done at Children's Medical Center, Tehran, Iran. We examined 168 bacterial strains isolated from 186 clinically diagnosed septicemia cases refereed at Children's Medical Center, Tehran, Iran. Over a period of twelve months from July 2010 to 2011 July. 11446 blood samples from patients of clinically suggestive septicemia were evaluated. RESULTS: Bacterial strains were isolated from 910 (7.95%) of blood cultures. Gram-negative bacteria identified were Pseudomonas species (20.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.86%), Salmonella spp (1.09%), Acinetobacter naumannii (8.13%), Escherichia coli (4.06%), Klebsiella spp (5.16%). Gram-negative pathogens were more than gram positive in bloodstream infections. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, USA) guidelines against: amikacin ampicillin, amoxicillin, amoxiclav, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefoperazone tetracycline, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin. Resistanc to different antibiotics in the most important isolated bacteria were: 32.1%, 10.8%, 87.8%, 96%, 39.1%, 35.2, 49.4%, 69%, 80.02%, 22%, 59%, 30.1% respectively, for Pseudomonas spp, 32%, 3.7%, 84.2%, 83.2%, 80.1%, 75.4%, 44.8%, 45.2%, 33.3%, 19%, 34.1, 11.5% respectively for Acinetobacter species. DISCUSSION: Resistant to majority of the antimicrobial agents for several pathogens implicated in bloodstream infections, particularly in Gram-negative bacteria, can make complication in treatment of infection cause by them.
