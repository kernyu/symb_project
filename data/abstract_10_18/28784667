Neisseria gonorrhoeae is one of the leading antimicrobial resistance threats worldwide. This study determined the MICs of closthioamide to be 0.008 to 0.5 mg/liter for clinical N. gonorrhoeae strains and related species. Cross-resistance with existing antimicrobial resistance was not detected, indicating that closthioamide could be used to treat drug-resistant N. gonorrhoeae.
