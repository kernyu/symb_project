Trichosporon species are usually opportunistic pathogens. Here, we present a case of esophagitis caused by T. inkin in a 54-year-old woman with pulmonary cancer and severe neutropenia in whom the susceptibility profile of the isolate against azoles and polyenes was verified. The patient was diagnosed with esophagitis grade I of Wilcox, presenting scattered whitish plaques and exudates in upper two-thirds of the esophageal mucosa. Antifungal therapy involving oral fluconazole (150 mg/day for 14 days) was ineffective. In vitro, the isolate showed no resistance to this azole and sensitivity to amphotericin B. Since T. inkin is of growing importance as an agent of invasive infections in immunocompromised patients, we stress that the diagnosis of esophagitis by this species should be followed by an assessment of the therapeutic sensitivity of the strain involved.
