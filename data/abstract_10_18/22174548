AIM: To determine the distribution of viral genotypes for primary or acquired lamivudine resistance. METHODS: A total of 283 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (245 patients with chronic hepatitis B and 38 inactive hepatitis B surface antigen carriers) were included in the study. The HBV genotype was determined by using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis, and tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate (YMDD) motif mutations were determined using the reverse transcriptase hybridization method. RESULTS: Lamivudine resistance was determined in a total of 25 (10.7%) chronic hepatitis B patients. Eight subjects (4%) had primary resistance to lamivudine, and 17 (53.1%) had secondary resistance to lamivudine. Genotype D, which was isolated from 267 of the patients with chronic HBV infection, was the dominant genotype in Turkey. CONCLUSION: Identification of YMDD motif mutations should have a positive impact on the selection of proper antiviral medication for patients, even for those who are nucleoside naive.
