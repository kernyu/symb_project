Apolipoprotein E (apoE) mimetic peptides derived from the low-density lipoprotein receptor-binding region of apoE with both activities against multidrug-resistant bacteria and immunomodulatory effects have not previously been reported. We identified an apoE mimetic peptide analogue of the receptor-binding region of apoE (abbreviated as apoE23) with the sequence of LRKLRKRLVRLASHLRKLRKRLL, which exhibited high antibacterial effects. The minimal inhibitory concentration of apoE23 against multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii was 6 microg/ml. The antimicrobial activity of apoE23 depended on its amphipathic alpha-helical conformation. Moreover, apoE23 downregulated the expression of tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 in lipopolysaccharide-induced THP-1 cells. ApoE23 exhibits potential in future clinical applications.
