UNLABELLED: The nucleotide sequence analysis of the gyrB gene indicated that the fish Aeromonas spp. isolates could be identified as Aeromonas hydrophila and Aeromonas veronii biovar sobria, whereas chicken Aeromonas spp. isolates identified as Aeromonas caviae. PCR data revealed the presence of Lip, Ser, Aer, ACT and CAI genes in fish Aer. hydrophila isolates, ACT, CAI and Aer genes in fish Aer. veronii bv sobria isolates and Ser and CAI genes in chicken Aer. caviae isolates. All chicken isolates showed variable resistance against all 12 tested antibiotic discs except for cefotaxime, nitrofurantoin, chloramphenicol and ciprofloxacin, only one isolate showed resistance to chloramphenicol and ciprofloxacin. Fish Aeromonads were sensitive to all tested antibiotic discs except amoxicillin, ampicillin-sulbactam and streptomycin. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Many integrated fish farms depend on the application of poultry droppings/litter which served as a direct feed for the fish and also acted as pond fertilizers. The application of untreated poultry manure exerts an additional pressure on the microbial world of the fish's environment. Aeromonas species are one of the common bacteria that infect both fish and chicken. The aim of this study was to compare the phenotypic traits and genetic relatedness of aeromonads isolated from two diverse hosts (terrestrial and aquatic), and to investigate if untreated manure possibly enhances Aeromonas dissemination among cohabitant fish with special reference to virulence genes and antibiotic resistant traits.
