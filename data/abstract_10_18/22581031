Helicobacter pylori-associated infections are extremely common in Iran, but few data about antibiotic sensitivity of H. pylori are available for this region. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of resistance in isolates against commonly used antibiotics in Eastern Azerbaijan, Iran, and the dependence of prevalence on the sex and age of patients. H. pylori isolates were collected by culture from gastric biopsies. Antibiotic susceptibility of isolates was determined by use of the disk agar diffusion test, and the minimum inhibitory concentration of clarithromycin was established by use of the Etest. A total 395 of biopsy specimens were studied; 112 samples of H. pylori were isolated (28.3 %), 55 (49 %) from males and 57 (51 %) from females. The prevalence of resistance to clarithromycin, metronidazole, erythromycin, amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, rifampin, nitrofurantoin, and tetracycline were 16 (14.3 %), 86 (76.8 %), 29 (26.0 %), 32 (28.6 %), 37 (33.0 %), 32 (28.6 %), 13 (11.6 %), and 21 (18.7 %), respectively. Antimicrobial resistance was not statistically significantly associated with sex or age. Furthermore, the prevalence of resistance to metronidazole was high and that to clarithromycin was reasonable, consistent with reported low success in H. pylori treatment in this area. Therefore, continuous surveillance of antibiotic resistance of H. pylori is essential.
