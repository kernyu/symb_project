Human African trypanosomiasis and Chagas disease are the main causes of heart failure in developing countries. The disadvantages of current therapy include: undesirable side-effects, resistance, lack of efficacy on late-stage disease and lack of pediatric formulations. Efforts to find new compound hits have spanned SAR studies to very high-throughput and virtual screens and drug repurposing. The integrated analysis of these strategies on the discovery of anti-Chagas agents is timely. This work accounts for the progress on the development of cruzain inhibitors following these avenues, with emphasis on structural aspects of the ligand-cruzain recognition process.
