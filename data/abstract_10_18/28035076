Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) plays important signaling roles in normal physiology and disease. However, analyzing the actions of H2O2 is often impeded by the difficulty in detecting this molecule. Herein, we report a novel nanocomposite-based electrochemical sensor for non-enzymatic detection of H2O2. Graphene oxide (GO) was selected as the dopant for the synthesis of polyaniline (PANI), leading to the successful fabrication of a water-soluble and stable GO-PANI composite. GO-PANI was subsequently subject to cyclic voltammetry to generate reduced GO-PANI (rGO-PANI), enhancing the conductivity of the material. Platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) were then electrodeposited on the surface of the rGO-PANI-modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) to form an electrochemical H2O2 sensor. Compared to previously reported sensors, the rGO-PANI-PtNP/GCE exhibited an expanded linear range, higher sensitivity, and lower detection limit in the quantification of H2O2. In addition, the sensor displayed outstanding reproducibility and selectivity in real-sample examination. Our study suggests that the rGO-PANI-PtNP/GCE may have broad utility in H2O2 detection under physiological and pathological conditions.
