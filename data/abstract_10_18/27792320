The discovery of potent and pan-genotypic HCV NS5A inhibitors faces many challenges including the significant diversity among genotypes, substantial potency shift conferred on some key resistance-associated variants, inconsistent SARs between different genotypes and mutants, and the lacking of models of inhibitor/protein complexes for rational inhibitor design. As part of ongoing efforts on HCV NS5A inhibition at Merck, we now describe the discovery of a novel series of chromane containing NS5A inhibitors. SAR studies around the "Z" group of the tetracyclic indole scaffold explored fused bicyclic rings as alternates to the phenyl group of elbasvir (1, MK-8742) and identified novel chromane and 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran derivatives as "Z" group replacements offered good potency across all genotypes. This effort, incorporating the C-1 fluoro substitution at the tetracyclic indole core, led to the discovery of a new series of NS5A inhibitors, such as compounds 14 and 25-28, with significantly improved potency against resistance-associated variants, such as GT2b, GT1a Y93H, and GT1a L31V. Compound 14 also showed reasonable PK exposures in preclinical species (rat and dog).
