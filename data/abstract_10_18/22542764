One of the issues of antibiotic treatment is to warrant its optimal effectiveness while minimizing the risk for emergence of resistance. The time above minimal inhibiting concentration (MIC) (T>MIC) is the best predictive pharmacological parameter of effectiveness for antibiotics with time-dependent activity, such as cloxacillin. Cloxacillin is the first line antibiotic in a great number of clinical situations generated by methicillin sensitive staphylococci, because of its intrinsic properties: bactericidal effect, tissue distribution and safety. The most recent anti-staphylococcal agents do not improve treatment of MSSA infections compared to penicillin M and especially cloxacillin. Cloxacillin has a narrow microbiological spectrum. This ecological feature is in line with the recommendation to use antibiotics with the narrowest spectrum to reduce the pressure of selection. The consensus is to have T>MIC for at least 40% of the dosing interval and is achieved by infusing 2g of cloxacillin per day (T>MIC=50%) or four infusions of 3g per day (T>MIC=42%) in adults.
