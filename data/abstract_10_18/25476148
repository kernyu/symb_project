As a part of our drug discovery program, ursolic acid was chemically transformed into six semi-synthetic derivatives, which were evaluated for their antibacterial and drug resistance reversal potential in combination with conventional antibiotic nalidixic acid against the nalidixic acid-sensitive and nalidixic acid-resistant strains of Escherichia coli. Although ursolic acid and its all semi-synthetic derivatives did not show antibacterial activity of their own, but in combination, they significantly reduced the minimum inhibitory concentration of nalidixic acid up to eightfold. The 3-O-acetyl-urs-12-en-28-isopropyl ester (UA-4) and 3-O-acetyl-urs-12-en-28-n-butyl ester (UA-5) derivatives of ursolic acid reduced the minimum inhibitory concentration of nalidixic acid by eightfold against nalidixic acid-resistant and four and eightfold against nalidixic acid-sensitive, respectively. The UA-4 and UA-5 were further evaluated for their synergy potential with another antibiotic tetracycline against the multidrug-resistant clinical isolate of Escherichia coli-KG4. The results showed that both these derivatives in combination with tetracycline reduced the cell viability in concentration-dependent manner by significantly inhibiting efflux pump. This was further supported by the in silico binding affinity of UA-4 and UA-5 with efflux pump proteins. These ursolic acid derivatives may find their potential use as synergistic agents in the treatment of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections.
