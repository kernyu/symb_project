DNA metabolism embodies a number of biochemical pathways, which include targets of clinically used antibiotics as well as those that are only being explored as potential targets for inhibitory compounds. We give an overview of representative cell-based and enzymatic assays suitable for high-throughput-driven search for novel DNA metabolism inhibitors of established and novel DNA metabolism targets in bacteria. The protocol for a colorimetric coupled primase-inorganic pyrophosphatase assay developed by our group is described in detail.
