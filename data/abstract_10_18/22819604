JNJ-Q2 is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone with activity against Gram-positive and -negative pathogens. The in vitro activity of JNJ-Q2 was evaluated when tested against Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates, including 31 ciprofloxacin-resistant strains with documented mutations in the quinolone resistance determining region. MIC values were determined using reference agar dilution methods using ciprofloxacin, penicillin, ceftriaxone, tetracycline, and azithromycin as comparators. All isolates were inhibited by </=0.25 mug/mL of JNJ-Q2 (range, 0.004-0.25 mug/mL; MIC(50/90), 0.03/0.25 mug/mL) which was 8-fold (MIC(50)) and 32-fold more potent (MIC(90)) compared to ciprofloxacin. Few strains were susceptible to penicillin (3.0%) and tetracycline (6.1%), and with the use of the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing interpretive criteria, 13.6% were resistant to azithromycin. All strains were susceptible to ceftriaxone, the most potent agent (MIC(90), 0.06 mug/mL) followed by JNJ-Q2 (MIC(90), 0.25 mug/mL). JNJ-Q2 appears to be a potent fluoroquinolone when tested against contemporary multidrug-resistant N. gonorrhoeae.
