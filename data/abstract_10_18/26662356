BACKGROUND: Overreliance on glyphosate as a single tool for weed management in agricultural systems in Brazil has selected glyphosate-resistant populations of tall windmill grass (Chloris elata Desv.). RESULTS: Two C. elata populations, one glyphosate resistant (GR) and one glyphosate susceptible (GS), were studied in detail for a dose-response experiment and for resistance mechanism. The dose causing 50% reduction in dry weight was 620 g a.e. ha(-1) for GR and 114 g ha(-1) for GS, resulting in an R/S ratio of 5.4. GS had significantly higher maximum (14) C-glyphosate absorption into the treated leaf (51.3%) than GR (39.5%), a difference of 11.8% in maximum absorption. GR also retained more (14) C-glyphosate in the treated leaf (74%) than GS (51%), and GR translocated less glyphosate (27%) to other plant parts (stems, roots and root exudation) than GS (36%). There were no mutations at the Pro106 codon in the gene encoding 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS). There was no difference in EPSPS genomic copy number or EPSPS transcription between GS and GR populations. CONCLUSION: Based on these data, reduced glyphosate absorption and increased glyphosate retention in the treated leaf contribute to glyphosate resistance in this C. elata population from Brazil.
