We report five cases of community- and hospital-acquired infections with oseltamivir- and peramivir-resistant A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses possessing the neuraminidase (NA) H275Y mutation during January-February 2016 in Japan. One case was hospitalized and was receiving oseltamivir for prophylaxis. The remaining four cases were not taking antiviral drugs at the time of sampling. These cases were geographically distant and epidemiologically unrelated. The five viruses showed ~300-fold rise in IC50 values against oseltamivir and peramivir, defined as highly reduced inhibition according to the WHO definition. Overall, the prevalence of the H275Y A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses was 1.8 % (5/282). The resistant viruses possessed the V241I, N369 K, and N386 K substitutions in the NA that have been previously reported among A(H1N1)pdm09 to alter transmission fitness. Analysis of Michaelis constant (Km) revealed that two of the isolates had reduced NA affinity to MUNANA, while the other three isolates displayed a slightly decreased affinity compared to the sensitive viruses. Further studies are needed to monitor the community spread of resistant viruses and to assess their transmissibility.
