Since the bacterial resistance to antibiotics is increasing rapidly, numerous studies have contributed to the design and synthesis of potent synthetic mimics of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). In an attempt to find the pharmacophore of short antimicrobial peptidomimetics through systematic tuning of hydrophobic and hydrophilic patterns, we have identified a set of short histidine-derived antimicrobial peptides (SAMPs) with potent and broad-spectrum activity. A combination of high antimicrobial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), without hemolytic activity and proteolytic stability makes these molecules promising candidates for novel antimicrobial therapeutics.
