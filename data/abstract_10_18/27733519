BACKGROUND: Fluoroquinolone-non-susceptible Escherichia coli isolated from patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis are a matter of increasing concern. Cefditoren pivoxil is an oral, beta-lactamase-stable, extended-spectrum cephalosporin that is effective against fluoroquinolone-non-susceptible bacteria. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical and microbiological efficacies of cefditoren pivoxil against acute uncomplicated cystitis and to determine the optimal duration of cefditoren pivoxil treatment. METHODS: We compared 3 and 7 day regimens of cefditoren pivoxil in a multicentre, randomized, open-label study. RESULTS: A total of 104 female patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis were enrolled and randomized into 3 day (n = 51) or 7 day (n = 53) treatment groups. At first visit, 94 bacterial strains were isolated from the 104 participants of which 81.7% (85/104) were E. coli. Clinical and microbiological efficacies were evaluated 5-9 days following administration of the final dose of cefditoren pivoxil. The clinical efficacies of the 3 and 7 day groups were 90.9% (40/44) and 93.2% (41/44), respectively (P = 1.000). The microbiological efficacies of the 3 and 7 day groups were 82.5% (33/40) and 90.2% (37/41), respectively (P = 0.349). There were no adverse events due to cefditoren pivoxil treatment, with the exception of a mild allergic reaction in one patient, after which the cefditoren pivoxil was exchanged for another antimicrobial. CONCLUSIONS: Cefditoren pivoxil is safe and effective for uncomplicated cystitis, with no significant differences in clinical and microbiological efficacies between 3 and 7 day regimens.
