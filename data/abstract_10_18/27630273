Pancreatic cancer has a dismal prognosis and there is an increasing and unmet need to identify better diagnostic and therapeutic targets in order to ameliorate the course of the disease. HMGB1, a nuclear DNA-binding protein that acts as a transcription factor, is currently in the limelight. HMGB1 exhibits a dual role in pancreatic cancer; when intracellular, it acts as an anti-tumor protein stabilizing the genome, whereas extracellular HMGB1 behaves as a pro-tumor protein with cytokine, chemokine and growth factor functions. Although the exact mechanisms of HMGB1 in pancreatic cancer are still to be elucidated, the significance of this protein for processes, such as autophagy, immunogenic cell death, tumor growth, metastasis and resistance to chemotherapy, have become increasingly clear. In this review, we provide a systematic summary and review of the biological and clinical relevance of HMGB1 in pancreatic cancer.
