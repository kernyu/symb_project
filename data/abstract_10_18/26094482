In recent years, the intensive use of antibiotics induces the development of antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs), which is an increasingly critical problem affecting human health, and the potential toxic effects of the ARGs have drawn great attention all over the world. This review gave an overview of the occurrence, potential sources, fate and ecological risks of ARGs in the environment. What's more, the removal of ARGs by different treatment processes such as sludge digestion, constructed wetland, disinfection and advanced treatments were assessed, and the improving directions of different treatment processes were also pointed out. Additionally, the highlights in need for further research were proposed based on the current pollution status.
