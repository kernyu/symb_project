Sporadic observations have shown changing patterns of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRMs) in HIV infection even without selection pressure by antiretroviral treatment (ART). Repeated genotypic resistance analyses in treatment-naive patients were performed, in order to analyze intraindividual variances of resistance patterns over time. Between the years 2001 and 2008 two genotypic resistance tests were performed at different time-points in 49 treatment-naive HIV-positive patients aged >18 years. Wild-type virus was found at baseline and during follow-up in 31 patients (group A, median time between resistance tests 146 days), while resistance mutations were found either at baseline or during follow-up in 18 patients (group B, median time between resistance tests 297 days). In group B, the pattern of resistance changed in eight out of 18 patients over time, with three patients showing decreasing numbers and five patients showing increasing numbers of resistance mutations. The pattern of resistance mutations remained unchanged in 10 out of 18 patients. The mutational pattern in untreated HIV infection may change over time and a single resistance analysis may underestimate the true prevalence of preserved resistance mutations. If these findings can be confirmed in a larger number of patients, it would be prudent to perform genotypic resistance testing both at baseline and prior to the start of ART in order to capture a more complete picture of preserved mutations before initiating ART.
