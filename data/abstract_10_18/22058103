PURPOSE: The implementation of an antimicrobial stewardship program at a health system is described. SUMMARY: In 2008, the Center for Antimicrobial Stewardship and Epidemiology (CASE) was formed at St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital (SLEH) to improve the quality of care for patients as it related to antimicrobial therapy. The charter of CASE contained specific aims for improving patient care, furthering clinical research, and training the next generation of clinical infectious diseases pharmacists. The CASE team consists of at least two infectious diseases pharmacists and one physician (the medical director) who provide direct oversight for antimicrobial utilization within the hospital. The CASE medical director, an infectious diseases physician, is responsible for overseeing the activities of the center. With the oversight of the CASE advisory board, the medical director develops and implements the antimicrobial stewardship and management policies for SLEH. Another key innovative feature of CASE is its extensive involvement in training new infectious diseases pharmacists and conducting research. CASE uses a model in which a clinical scenario or problem is identified, a research project is undertaken to further elucidate the problem, and policy changes are made to improve patient outcomes. The CASE team is supported by a CASE advisory board, a CASE research collaborative including university faculty, and a dedicated training program for pharmacy fellows, residents, and students. CONCLUSION: Implementation of an antimicrobial stewardship program at a health system helped decrease the inappropriate use of antibiotics, improve patient care and outcomes, further clinical research, and increase training opportunities for future clinical infectious diseases pharmacists.
