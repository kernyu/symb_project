Although many publications on the subject are available, only few campaigns for stethoscopes cleaning and disinfection are conducted. Stethoscope is a "not critical" reusable medical device and should benefit from a cleaning disinfection "low level" after each use. We studied the bacterial contamination of stethoscopes in our hospital and measured the role of bacterial reservoir and/or vector stethoscope could play. Mean microbial load was estimated at 1.550 CFU per stethoscope. Results obtained in our hospital and those of the literature, led us to propose a simple and efficient cleaning method. We believe motivate everyone to change their habits and carry out disinfection more frequent their very handling stethoscope.
