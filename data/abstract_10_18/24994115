OBJECTIVES: Highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was scaled up in Guangxi, China in 2005. The number of individuals receiving free HAART increased dramatically from June 2010 under the Guangxi Government's anti-HIV programme. We aimed to determine the prevalence of HIV-transmitted drug resistance (TDR) of Guangxi. METHODS: HIV-positive, antiretroviral-naive individuals were recruited from the east (Hezhou), south (Qinzhou), west (Baise), north (Guilin) and centre (Laibin) of Guangxi. The pol gene of the virus from the individuals was analysed. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of HIV TDR was 3.2% (7/216, 95% CI 0.9-5.5). The prevalence rates in Baise, Guilin, Hezhou, Qinzhou and Laibin are 4.9% (2/41, 95% CI -1.7 to 11.5), 2.3% (1/44, 95% CI -2.1 to 5.7), 4.7% (2/43, 95% CI -1.6 to 11.0), 2.6% (1/38, 95% CI -2.5 to 7.7) and 2.0% (1/50, 95% CI -1.9 to 5.9), respectively. No significant difference in the prevalence was found among them. No factors were found to be associated with TDR, including CD4 cell counts, viral loads and genotypes. The subtypes CRF01_AE, CRF07_BC, CRF08_BC and B were found. Subtype CRF08_BC is the predominant subtype in Baise while CRF01_AE is the predominant subtype elsewhere in Guangxi. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of TDR in antiretroviral-naive patients in Guangxi remains low 8 years after scale-up of HAART.
