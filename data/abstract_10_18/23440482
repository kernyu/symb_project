UNLABELLED: Recent findings have focused on the possible role of linezolid (LZD) as a suitable candidate for the treatment of central nervous system infections. LZD treatment for meningitis has been sporadically reported in adults, but there are no reports in neonates or infants. We report a case of meningitis caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) in a neonatal girl. The patient had intraventricular hemorrhage on postnatal day 1 and was treated with ventricular drainage. Twenty-two days after drainage, the patient developed a fever and seizure. Although ampicillin and ceftriaxone were given empirically for meningitis, an increased cell count and protein were observed in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Vancomycin (VCM) was administered intravenously because MRSE was detected from CSF 2 days after the administration of ampicillin and ceftriaxone. However, intravenous administration of VCM did not show any effect. Subsequent treatment of LZD successfully reduced the cell count and protein in CSF. CONCLUSION: LZD may be a treatment option for neonates and infants for drain-associated meningitis caused by MRSE.
