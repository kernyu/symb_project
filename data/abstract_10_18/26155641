There were studied Salmonella spp. isolated from various objects (sick patients, bacteria carriers, food, sewages) in the Krasnoyarsk region. Susceptibility to antimicrobial drugs was estimated with disc diffusion method. Bacterial cultures form sick patients were highly susceptible to aminoglycosides (amikacin and gentamicin)--susceptible strains accounted for 98-99%, carbapenems (imipenem)--100%, cephalosporins (cephtriaxone)--97.8%, fluoroquinolones (ophloxacin)--95.8%, quinolones (ciprofloxacin)-- 88.9%, chloramphenicol--86.8%. Salmonella showed lesser susceptibility to sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim 81.4%. Ampicillin--73.6% inhibitor protected antibiotic amoxicillin/clavulanic acid--86.4%. Salmonella spp. are the most resistant to tetracycline, the proportion of susceptible strains was less than a third--22.1%. The comparison of resistance of serovar S. enterica Enteritidis. with other serologic strains 'of S. enterica (S. Typhimurium, S. Infantis, S. Tshiongtve, S. Agama et al.) revealed greater resistance of anot Eneteritidis)) isolates to ampicillin, amoxicillin/ clavulanic acid,. ciprofloxacin and greater differences in resistance were to ofloksacin and, co-trimoxasol. The most high resistance ofthe all serovars S. enterica is to tetracycline (S. Enteritidis--26.2%, "non Enteritidis"--9.1%). Thus salmonella circulating in the Krasnoyarsk region are characterized by susceptibility to the most of antimicrobial drugs. The high resistance of islitates is revealed to tetracycline, ampicillin and sulfonamides.
