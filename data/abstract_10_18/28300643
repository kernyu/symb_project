OBJECTIVES: Salmonella spp. represent one of the main diarrhoeal pathogens that are transmitted via the food supply chain. Here we report the draft genome sequence of a multidrug-resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Brancaster (PS01) that was isolated from poultry meat in Malaysia. METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from Salmonella strain PS01 and was sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. The generated reads were de novo assembled using CLC Genomics Workbench. The draft genome was annotated and the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes was identified. RESULTS: The 5 036 442bp genome contains various antimicrobial resistance genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, fosfomycin, macrolides, phenicols, sulphonamides, tetracyclines and trimethoprim. The beta-lactamase gene blaTEM-176 encoding TEM-176 was also found in this strain. CONCLUSIONS: The genome sequence will aid in the understanding of drug resistance mechanisms in foodborne Salmonella Brancaster and highlights the need to ensure the judicious use of antibiotics in animal husbandry as well as the importance of implementing proper food handling and preparation practices.
