Haemonchus contortus resistant to multiple anthelmintics threaten the viability of the small ruminant industry in areas where this parasite is prevalent. In response to this situation, the FAMACHA(c) system was developed and validated for use with small ruminants as a way to detect clinical anemia associated with haemonchosis. Given that H. contortus and multiple anthelmintic resistance is a similar problem in camelids, the FAMACHA(c) system might also provide the same benefits. To address this need, a validation study of the FAMACHA(c) system was conducted on 21 alpaca and llama farms over a 2-year period. H. contortus was the predominant nematode parasite on 17 of the 21 farms (10 alpaca and 7 llama farms) enrolled in the study, based on fecal culture results. The FAMACHA(c) card was used to score the color of the lower palpebral (lower eye lid) conjunctiva on a 1-5 scale. Packed cell volume (PCV) values were measured and compared to FAMACHA(c) scores using FAMACHA(c) score cutoffs of >/=3 or >/=4 and with anemia defined as a PCV </=15%, </=17%, or</=20%. PCV was significantly associated with FAMACHA(c) score, fecal egg count (FEC), and body condition score (BCS), regardless of the FAMACHA(c) cutoff score or the PCV% chosen to define clinical anemia (p<0.01 in all cases). The use of FAMACHA(c) scores >/=3 and PCV >/= 15% indicating anemia provided the best sensitivity (96.4% vs 92.9% for FAMACHA(c) >/=4), whereas FAMACHA scores >/= 4 and PCV </=20% provided the best specificity (94.2% vs 69.1% for FAMACHA(c) >/=3). The data from this study support the FAMACHA(c) system as a useful tool for detecting clinical anemia in camelids suffering from haemonchosis. Parameters for making treatment decisions based on FAMACHA(c) score in camelids should mirror those established for small ruminants.
