Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of clinical isolates is a crucial step toward appropriate treatment of infectious diseases. The clinical isolate Francisella philomiragia 14IUHPL001, recently isolated from a 63-year-old woman with atypical pneumonia, featured decreased susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics when cultivated in 5% CO2. Quantitative beta-lactamase assays demonstrated a significant (P < 0.0001) increase in enzymatic activity between bacteria cultivated in 5% CO2 over those incubated in ambient air. The presence of beta-lactamase genes blaTEM and blaSHV was detected in the clinical isolate F. philomiragia 14IUHPL001 by PCR, and the genes were positively identified by nucleotide sequencing. Expression of blaTEM and blaSHV was detected by reverse transcription-PCR during growth at 5% CO2 but not during growth in ambient air. A statistically significant alkaline shift was observed following cultivation of F. philomiragia 14IUHPL001 in both ambient air and 5% CO2, allowing desegregation of the previously reported effects of acidic pH from the currently reported effect of 5% CO2 on blaTEM and blaSHV beta-lactamases. To ensure that the observed phenomenon was not unique to F. philomiragia, we evaluated a clinical isolate of blaTEM-carrying Haemophilus influenzae and found parallel induction of blaTEM gene expression and beta-lactamase activity at 5% CO2 relative to ambient air. IMPORTANCE beta-Lactamase induction and concurrent beta-lactam resistance in respiratory tract pathogens as a consequence of growth in a physiologically relevant level of CO2 are of clinical significance, particularly given the ubiquity of TEM and SHV beta-lactamase genes in diverse bacterial pathogens. This is the first report of beta-lactamase induction by 5% CO2.
