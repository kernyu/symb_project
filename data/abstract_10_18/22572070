BACKGROUND: Bloodstream infections are a significant cause of neonatal morbidity and death. An increase in the incidence of early neonatal sepsis due to Escherichia coli has been reported. The objective was to evaluate the antimicrobial resistance of E. coli strains causing early-onset neonatal sepsis (EONS) and late-onset neonatal sepsis (LONS) and their evolution. METHODS: E. coli strains from EONS and hospital-acquired LONS collected at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona were included in the study. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences in resistance profiles were found between strains causing EONS and LONS. An increase in the resistance to all the antimicrobial agents studied was observed for the period 2000-2008 in comparison with the 1985-1999 period, with the increase in resistance to gentamicin, piperacillin and tobramycin being statistically significant. Two strains carried the bla(CTX-M) genes (bla(CTX-M-14) and bla(CTX-M-15)). CONCLUSION: The increase in ampicillin and gentamicin resistance makes a change in the treatment of neonates necessary.
