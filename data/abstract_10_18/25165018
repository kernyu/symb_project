Enterococcus spp. are among the common pathogens causing infective endocarditis (IE). Despite major medical advances and new potent antimicrobial agents, the mortality has not significantly improved for several decades. The usual lack of bactericidal activity of penicillin or ampicillin, the toxicity from the combination of penicillin plus aminoglycosides, and the increased reports of high-level resistance to aminoglycosides have led to the exploration of other regimens for treatment of Enterococcus faecalis IE. As an example, ampicillin plus ceftriaxone is now a well-recognized regimen for this organism. However, the emerging of new drug resistances in Enterococcus faecium dramatically reduces the therapeutic alternatives for this organism in IE which continues to be an immense challenge for clinicians even with the availability of newer antimicrobial agents. This article summarizes the current treatment options for enterococcal endocarditis and reviews of recent publications on the topic.
