Resistance to the first-line NRTIs, tenofovir and emtricitabine, does not generally confer resistance to zidovudine. The objective of this study was to describe the efficacy of zidovudine as modern day salvage antiretroviral therapy. This was a single-center, retrospective, observational, cohort study. Adult HIV-positive patients prescribed a zidovudine-containing regimen between 2005 and 2010 were identified from a computer database. All patients had failed at least one prior antiretroviral regimen before zidovudine. The primary outcome measure was virologic success at 24 weeks. Other efficacy and safety outcomes were determined, including virologic success at 48 and 96 weeks, CD4 count change from baseline, and incidence of adverse effects. Sixty-nine subjects were enrolled. The mean age was 43 years, 70% were male, and 85.5% were black. Most patients were highly antiretroviral experienced. At 24 weeks, 63.8% and 72.5% of patients achieved HIV RNA less than 50 and 400 c/mL, respectively. The median change in CD4 count from baseline to week 24 was +70 cells/mm(3). The percent of patients who discontinued zidovudine due to adverse effects was 10%. In this highly treatment-experienced population, zidovudine as part of a salvage regimen appeared effective. Gastrointestinal adverse effects were reported, but zidovudine-associated metabolic effects were uncommon, suggesting zidovudine was generally well tolerated.
