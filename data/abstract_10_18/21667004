INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to evaluate the activity of daptomycin and other agents against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates collected from 2001 to 2010, in order to determine changes and to detect resistance trends. METHODS: The study included a total of 1,130 MRSA isolates collected as part of a multicenter surveillance program for antibiotic resistance, Estudio de Vigilancia de Resistencia a los Antimicrobianos (VIRA study), from 51 medical centers throughout Spain between 2001 and 2010. Broth microdilution test was performed according to the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. RESULTS: Daptomycin showed excellent activity and maintained its activity over time; only one MRSA isolate collected in 2001 was nonsusceptible to this agent (MIC=2 mg/L). Based on the MIC90, daptomycin was 2-4 dilutions more active than vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid. Daptomycin retained activity against MRSA isolates that were resistant to linezolid, to quinupristin-dalfopristin, or showed intermediate susceptibility to vancomycin. CONCLUSIONS: Our data and those of other studies, coupled with daptomycin's rapid bactericidal activity, suggest that this antimicrobial could be an alternative in the treatment of severe infections caused by multiresistant S. aureus.
