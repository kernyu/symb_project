BACKGROUND: The rate of antimicrobial resistant isolates among pathogens causing urinary tract infections (UTIs) in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is not known. The aim of the current study was to determine this rate at the Bukavu Provincial General Hospital (province of South-Kivu, DRC). FINDINGS: A total of 643 isolates (both from inpatients and outpatients) collected from September 2012 to August 2013 were identified using biochemical methods, and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. The isolates were further screened for Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamases (ESBL) production. Beta-lactamase AmpC phenotype was investigated in 20 antibiotic-resistant isolates.Escherichia coli (58.5%), Klebsiella spp. (21.9%) and Enterobacter spp. (16.2%) were the most frequent uropathogens encountered. Rare uropathogens included Citrobacter spp., Proteus spp., and Acinetobacter spp. Resistance was significantly more present in inpatients isolates (22.1% of isolates) when compared to outpatients isolates (8.4% of isolates), (p-value <0.001). Antibiotic-resistant isolates displayed resistance to common antimicrobial drugs used for UTIs treatment in South Kivu province, namely: ciprofloxacin, ampicillin and third generation cephalosporins. ESBL-phenotype was present in 92.9% of antibiotic-resistant isolates. Only amikacin, nitrofurantoin and imipenem displayed satisfactory activity against antibiotic resistant isolates. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the presence of antibiotic-resistant uropathogens (mainly ESBL-producers isolates) at the Bukavu General Hospital. This study should serve as a wake-up call and help to raise awareness about the threat to public health of antibiotic resistance in this DRC province.
