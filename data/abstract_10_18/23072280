Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is a potent plant defence system that, in response to a first contact with a plant pathogen, prepares the whole plant for subsequent attacks, so that it becomes more resistant to the same and to other pathogens. BcSpl1, a cerato-platanin family protein abundantly secreted by Botrytis cinerea, is required for full virulence and elicits the hypersensitive response in the host. Here, we report that BcSpl1 is also able to induce in tobacco systemic resistance to two plant pathogens, Pseudomonas syringae and B. cinerea, which correlates with the induction of two pathogenesis-related genes, PR-1a and PR-5. Levels of salicylic acid were quantified in situ on BcSpl1 infiltration, and a wave of salicylic acid departing from the point of infiltration and running through the leaf was observed, as well as the appearance of this plant hormone in the neighbouring leaves as early as 3 days after infiltration.
