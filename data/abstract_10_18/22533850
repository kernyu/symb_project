A number of fatty acyl derivatives of (-)-2',3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine (lamivudine, 3TC, 1) were synthesized and evaluated for their anti-HIV activity. The monosubstituted 5'-O-fatty acyl derivatives of 3TC (EC(50) = 0.2-2.3 muM) were more potent than the corresponding monosubstituted N(4)-fatty acyl (EC(50) = 0.4-29.4 muM) and 5'-O-N(4)-disubstituted (EC(50) = 72.6 to >154.0 muM) derivatives of the nucleoside. 5'-O-Myristoyl (16) and 5'-O-12-azidododecanoyl derivatives (17) were found to be the most potent compounds (EC(50) = 0.2-0.9 muM) exhibiting at least 16-36-fold higher anti-HIV activity against cell-free virus than 1 (EC(50) = 11.4-32.7 muM). The EC(90) values for 16 against B-subtype and C-subtype clinical isolates were several folds lower than those of 1. The cellular uptake studies confirmed that compound 16 accumulated intracellularly after 1 h of incubation with CCRF-CEM cells and underwent intracellular hydrolysis. 5'-O-Fatty acyl derivatives of 1 showed significantly higher anti-HIV activity than the corresponding physical mixtures against the B-subtype virus.
