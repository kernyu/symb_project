AIM: To investigate whether 7-d triple therapies are still valid in populations with low levels of resistance. METHODS: A total of 1106 Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)-positive patients were divided into three groups, each of which received one type of 7-d triple therapy. Therapeutic outcomes of the patients were assessed by the (13)C-urea breath test at 8 wk after treatment. The susceptibility of H. pylori to antibiotics was determined by an agar-dilution method. Data analysis was performed by chi(2) tests. RESULTS: The eradication rates in groups A, B and C were 90.71% (332/366), 90.46% (313/346) and 90.87% (189/208), respectively (P = 0.986). The resistance rates were 8.91% for clarithromycin, 14.78% for levofloxacin and 0% for amoxicillin. The eradication rate was significantly different between clarithromycin- and levofloxacin-resistant patients (P < 0.05) in group A. Patients whose treatment failed in group A also had a higher clarithromycin resistance rate than did successive patients (P = 0.034). However, levofloxacin resistance had no obvious influence on the eradication rate. Furthermore, three main antibiotics (clarithromycin, levofloxacin and amoxicillin) had lower DID (defined daily dose per 1000 inhabitants per day) in this city. CONCLUSION: Clarithromycin resistance is the main reason for the failure of 7-d triple therapy. In populations with low levels of resistance, a 7-d triple therapy is a viable choice. The choice of therapy should not be influenced by conditions in high antibiotic resistance regions.
