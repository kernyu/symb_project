Oral antibiotics such as metronidazole, vancomycin and fidaxomicin are therapies of choice for Clostridium difficile infection. Several important mechanisms for C. difficile antibiotic resistance have been described, including the acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes via the transfer of mobile genetic elements, selective pressure in vivo resulting in gene mutations, altered expression of redox-active proteins, iron metabolism, and DNA repair, as well as via biofilm formation. This update summarizes new information published since 2010 on phenotypic and genotypic resistance mechanisms in C. difficile and addresses susceptibility test methods and other strategies to counter antibiotic resistance of C. difficile.
