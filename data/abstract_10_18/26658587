BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Increase in the isolation of drug resistant phenotypes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis necessitates accuracy in the testing methodology. Critical concentration defining resistance for ethionamide (ETO), needs re-evaluation in accordance with the current scenario. Thus, re-evaluation of conventional minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and proportion sensitivity testing (PST) methods for ETO was done to identify the ideal breakpoint concentration defining resistance. METHODS: Isolates of M. tuberculosis (n=235) from new and treated patients were subjected to conventional MIC and PST methods for ETO following standard operating procedures. RESULTS: With breakpoint concentration set at 114 and 156 microg/ml, an increase in specificity was observed whereas sensitivity was high with 80 microg/ml as breakpoint concentration. Errors due to false resistant and susceptible isolates were least at 80 microg/ml concentration. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Performance parameters at 80 microg/ml breakpoint concentration indicated significant association between PST and MIC methods.
