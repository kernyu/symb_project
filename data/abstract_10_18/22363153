BACKGROUND: Mupirocin has been used for the treatment of skin infections and eradication of nasal carriage of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The increased use of this antibiotic has been accompanied by outbreaks of MRSA that are resistant to mupirocin. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the prevalence, genotype and antimicrobial susceptibility of mupirocin-resistant MRSA from 4 Korean hospitals. METHODS: A total 193 MRSA clinical isolates were collected from four university hospitals. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests, including mupirocin, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern analysis were performed. RESULTS: Overall, 27 of the 193 (14.1%) MRSA isolates were resistant to mupirocin. All of the (A) hospital isolates showed high-level (HL) mupirocin resistance and the low-level (LL) mupirocin resistant strains were from three other hospitals. The PFGE patterns of 16 mupirocin-resistant isolates were divided into 5 clusters (1-5), and the nine HL mupirocin-resistant isolates belonged to cluster 1. Both the HL and LL mupirocin-resistant MRSA isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and rifampin, but they were resistant to ciprofloxacin, clindamycin and tetracycline. The erythromycin and fusidic acid resistance rates were different between the HL and LL resistant isolates. CONCLUSION: HL mupirocin-resistant isolates that could transfer this resistance to other bacteria were detected and these isolates were clonally related. The emergence of mupirocin resistant isolates emphasizes the importance of using antibiotics judiciously and carefully monitoring the prevalence of mupirocin resistance.
