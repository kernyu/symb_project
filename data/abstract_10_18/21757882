Amicrobial pustulosis of the folds (APF) is a recently described entity characterized by relapsing pustular lesions predominantly involving the cutaneous flexures and scalp. This disease typically occurs in association with systemic lupus erythematosus and a variety of other autoimmune diseases. We here describe an APF-like pustular eruption predominantly affecting the scalp, face and trunk, occurring during long-term infliximab treatment for Crohn's disease. Immunohistochemical staining of skin biopsy specimens for myxovirus resistance protein A, a marker for type 1 interferon-inducible proteins, showed increased staining in the epidermis and dermal mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate. Our observation further extends the spectrum of cutaneous adverse reactions potentially related to anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha, the clinical context in which APF can occur as well as its clinical presentations.
