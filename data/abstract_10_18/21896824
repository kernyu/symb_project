The aim of this study was to investigate the association between genetic polymorphisms of Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt), P. falciparum multidrug resistance 1 (pfmdr1), and P. falciparum ATPase (pfatp6) and clinical outcome after a three-day mefloquine-artesunate combination therapy in 134 patients with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in an area with multidrug resistance along the Thailand-Myanmar border. Analysis of gene mutation and amplification were performed by nested real-time polymerase chain reaction and SYBR Green I real-time polymerase chain reaction, respectively. The mutation for pfcrt (codons 76, 220, 271, 326, 356, and 371) was found in all isolates (100%), whereas no mutation of pfmdr1 (codon 86) and pfatp6 (codons 37, 693, 769, 898) was found. The Pfmdr1 copy number was significantly higher in isolates with recrudescence (median number = 2.44) compared with a sensitive response (median number = 1.44). The gene copy number was also found to be significantly higher in paired isolates collected before treatment and at the time of recrudescence. All isolates carried one pfatp6 gene copy.
