Carbapenems have been used for many years to treat severe nosocomial Enterobacteriaceae infections. The spread of resistance to these drugs among other bacterial families is an emerging problem worldwide, mostly caused by New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM-1). We screened for the prevalence of NDM-1-expressing enteric pathogens from hospitalized patients with acute diarrhea in Kolkata, India, and identified 27 Vibrio fluvialis-harboring blaNDM-1 (NDM-VF) strains. These isolates were also resistant to all the tested antimicrobial drugs except doxycycline. The large plasmid of V. fluvialis harboring blaNDM-1 could be easily transferred to other enteric pathogens. Genes flanking the blaNDM-1 were found to be identical to the reported sequence from an Escherichia coli isolate. Analyses showed that the V. fluvialis possessing the NDM-VF region belonged to different clones. The pathogenicity of V. fluvialis to humans and its ubiquitous presence in the environment call for constant monitoring of this species for emerging antimicrobial drug resistance.
