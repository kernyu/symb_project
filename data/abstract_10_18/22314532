GSK2248761 is a novel, once-daily (QD), next-generation nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) with activity against efavirenz-resistant strains. Two phase I/IIa, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies investigated the antiviral activity, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of several doses of GSK2248761 monotherapy in treatment-naive HIV-infected subjects. In the initial study, 10 subjects (8 active and 2 placebo) per dose received sequentially descending GSK2248761 monotherapy regimens of 800, 400, 200, and 100 mg QD for 7 days. Because a dose-response relationship was not identified, a second study examined a lower, 30-mg QD dose in 8 subjects (6 active and 2 placebo). Adverse events, viral load (VL), PK, and reverse transcriptase mutations were assessed and combined for analysis. Treatment with GSK2248761 for 7 days was well tolerated with no serious adverse events or discontinuations. The mean VL reductions from baseline on day 8 were 0.97, 1.87, 1.84, 1.81, and 1.78 log(10) copies/ml for GSK2248761 doses of 30, 100, 200, 400, and 800 mg QD, respectively. GSK2248761 PK (maximum drug concentration in serum [C(max)], area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 h to the end of the dosing interval [AUC(0-tau)], and concentration at the end of the dosing interval [C(tau)]) increased proportionally over the dose range of 30 to 800 mg QD. The relationship between short-term VL change and GSK2248761 PK was best described by a maximum-effect (E(max)) model using C(tau) (E(max) = 2.0; 50% effective concentration [EC(50)] = 36.9 ng/ml). No NNRTI resistance mutations emerged during the study. GSK2248761 at 100 to 800 mg QD for 7 days was well tolerated, demonstrated potent antiviral activity in treatment-naive HIV-infected subjects, and had favorable PK and resistance profiles. GSK2248761 is no longer in clinical development.
