Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) from patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) fail to produce microbicidal concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to mutations in NOX2. Patients with CGD suffer from severe, life-threatening infections and inflammatory complications. Granulibacter bethesdensis is an emerging Gram-negative pathogen in CGD that resists killing by PMN of CGD patients (CGD PMN) and inhibits PMN apoptosis through unknown mechanisms. Microarray analysis was used to study mRNA expression in PMN from healthy subjects (normal PMN) and CGD PMN during incubation with G. bethesdensis and, simultaneously, in G. bethesdensis with normal and CGD PMN. We detected upregulation of antiapoptotic genes (e.g., XIAP and GADD45B) and downregulation of proapoptotic genes (e.g., CASP8 and APAF1) in infected PMN. Transcript and protein levels of inflammation- and immunity-related genes were also altered. Upon interaction with PMN, G. bethesdensis altered the expression of ROS resistance genes in the presence of normal but not CGD PMN. Levels of bacterial stress response genes, including the ClpB gene, increased during phagocytosis by both normal and CGD PMN demonstrating responses to oxygen-independent PMN antimicrobial systems. Antisense knockdown demonstrated that ClpB is dispensable for extracellular growth but is essential for bacterial resistance to both normal and CGD PMN. Metabolic adaptation of Granulibacter growth in PMN included the upregulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase. Pharmacological inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase by triphenylbismuthdichloride was lethal to Granulibacter. This study expands knowledge of microbial pathogenesis of Granulibacter in cells from permissive (CGD) and nonpermissive (normal) hosts and identifies potentially druggable microbial factors, such as pyruvate dehydrogenase and ClpB, to help combat this antibiotic-resistant pathogen.
