Escherichia coli ATCC 12806 was exposed to increasing subinhibitory concentrations of three biocides widely used in food industry facilities: trisodium phosphate (TSP), sodium nitrite (SNI), and sodium hypochlorite (SHY). The cultures exhibited an acquired tolerance to biocides (especially to SNI and SHY) after exposure to such compounds. E. coli produced biofilms (as observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy) on polystyrene microtiter plates. Previous adaptation to SNI or SHY enhanced the formation of biofilms (with an increase in biovolume and surface coverage) both in the absence and in the presence (MIC/2) of such compounds. TSP reduced the ability of E. coli to produce biofilms. The concentration of suspended cells in the culture broth in contact with the polystyrene surfaces did not influence the biofilm structure. The increase in cell surface hydrophobicity (assessed by a test of microbial adhesion to solvents) after contact with SNI or SHY appeared to be associated with a strong capacity to form biofilms. Cultures exposed to biocides displayed a stable reduced susceptibility to a range of antibiotics (mainly aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, and quinolones) compared with cultures that were not exposed. SNI caused the greatest increase in resistances (14 antibiotics [48.3% of the total tested]) compared with TSP (1 antibiotic [3.4%]) and SHY (3 antibiotics [10.3%]). Adaptation to SHY involved changes in cell morphology (as observed by scanning electron microscopy) and ultrastructure (as observed by transmission electron microscopy) which allowed this bacterium to persist in the presence of severe SHY challenges. The findings of the present study suggest that the use of biocides at subinhibitory concentrations could represent a public health risk.
