Although macroautophagy/autophagy is a key contributor to malignant pathogenesis and therapeutic resistance, there are few FDA-approved agents that significantly affect this pathway. We used medicinal chemistry strategies to develop ROC-325, an orally available novel inhibitor of lysosomal-mediated autophagy. Detailed in vitro and in vivo studies in preclinical models of renal cell carcinoma demonstrated that ROC-325 triggered the hallmark features of lysosomal autophagy inhibition, was very well tolerated, and exhibited significant superiority with respect to autophagy inhibition and anticancer activity over hydroxychloroquine. Our findings support the clinical investigation of the safety and preliminary efficacy of ROC-325 in patients with autophagy-dependent malignancies and other disorders where aberrant autophagy contributes to disease pathogenesis.
