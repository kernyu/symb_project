Nosocomial pathogens can be associated with a variety of infections, particularly in intensive care units (ICUs) and in immunocompromised patients. Usually these pathogens are resistant to multiple drugs and pose therapeutic challenges. Among these organisms, Acinetobacter baumannii is one of the most frequent being encountered in the clinical setting. Carbapenems are very useful to treat infections caused by these drug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli, but carbapenem resistance is increasing globally. Combination therapy is frequently given empirically for hospital-acquired infections in critically ill patients and is usually composed of an adequate beta-lactam and an aminoglycoside. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of plazomicin against carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Amikacin was used as a comparator. The activity of plazomicin in combination with several different antibiotics was tested by disk diffusion, the checkerboard method, and time-kill studies. Synergy was consistently observed with carbapenems (meropenem and/or imipenem) along with plazomicin or amikacin. When the aminoglycosides were combined with other classes of antibiotics, synergy was observed in some cases, depending on the strain and the antibiotic combination; importantly, there was no antagonism observed in any case. These findings indicate the potential utility of plazomicin in combination with other antibiotics (mainly carbapenems) for the treatment of A. baumannii infections, including those caused by carbapenem-resistant isolates.
