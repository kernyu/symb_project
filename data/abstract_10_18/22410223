This study evaluated the high pressure inactivation of Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, and poultry meat spoilage organisms. All treatments were performed in aseptically prepared minced poultry meat. Treatment of 19 strains of C. jejuni at 300 MPa and 30 degrees C revealed a large variation of pressure resistance. The recovery of pressure-induced sublethally injured C. jejuni depended on the availability of iron. The addition of iron content to enumeration media was required for resuscitation of sublethally injured cells. Survival of C. jejuni during storage of refrigerated poultry meat was analyzed in fresh and pressuretreated poultry meat, and in the presence or absence of spoilage microbiota. The presence of spoilage microbiota did not significantly influence the survival of C. jejuni. Pressure treatment at 400 MPa and 40 degrees C reduced cell counts of Brochothrix thermosphacta, Carnobacterium divergens, C. jejuni, and Pseudomonas fluorescens to levels below the detection limit. Cell counts of E. coli AW1.7, however, were reduced by only 3.5 log (CFU/g) and remained stable during subsequent refrigerated storage. The resistance to treatment at 600 MPa and 40 degrees C of E. coli AW1.7 was compared with Salmonella enterica, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli and nonpathogenic E. coli strains, and Staphylococcus spp. Cell counts of all organisms except E. coli AW 1.7 were reduced by more than 6 log CFU/g. Cell counts of E. coli AW1.7 were reduced by 4.5 log CFU/g only. Moreover, the ability of E. coli AW1.7 to resist pressure was comparable to the pressure-resistant mutant E. coli LMM1030. Our results indicate that preservation of fresh meat requires a combination of high pressure with high temperature (40 to 60 degrees C) or other antimicrobial hurdles.
