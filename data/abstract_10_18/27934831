Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been proved to be effective against fungi and it may be employed as a coadjutant to conventional antifungal agents, leading to a more effective microbial control minimising side effects. This work evaluates the combined effect of PDT and fluconazole against resistant Candida albicans, Candida glabrata and Candida krusei. The yeasts were submitted to methylene blue-PDT (MB-PDT) in sub-inhibitory concentrations. In the present work, MB-PDT combined with fluconazole was more efficient in the inhibition of the C. albicans and C. glabrata than each treatment alone, being possible to infer that the treatments are synergic.
