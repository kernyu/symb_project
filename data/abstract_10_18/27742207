Nowadays bacterial resistance to known antibiotics is a serious health problem. In order to achieve more efficient treatment, lately there is an effort to find new substances, such as certain biomaterials, that are non-toxic to humans with antibiotic potential. Lignins and lignin-derived compounds have been proposed to be good candidates for use in medicine and health maintenance. In this study, the antibacterial activity of the lignin model polymer dehydrogenate polymer (DHP) in alginate hydrogel (Alg) was studied. The obtained results show that DHP-Alg has strong antimicrobial activity against several bacterial strains and biofilms and does not have a toxic effect on human epithelial cells. These results strongly suggest its application as a wound healing agent or as an adjunct substance for wound treatments.
