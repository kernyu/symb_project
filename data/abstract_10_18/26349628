9-Oxime acylides have different SAR and binding modes from 9-oxime ketolides. An aminopyridyl or carbamoylpyridyl group anchored at the end of the 9-oxime 2-propargyl group is beneficial for antimicrobial activity. Both the 2-pyridyl and 3-pyridyl groups derived from 3-OH have stacking interactions with the base pair G2505/C2610 (Escherichia coli numbering) of the bacterial rRNA. Compounds 3 presented characteristic features that belong to bactericidal agents when used against constitutive-erm resistant Staphylococcus aureus, susceptible and mef-encoded Streptococcus pneumoniae, inducible-erm resistant Streptococcus pyogenes, and Moraxella catarrhalis. A docking model indicated that the carbamoylpyridyl group of 3h may hydrogen bond to G2061 in addition to pi-pi stacking over the adenine of A2062 that proved to gate the tunnel for the egress of the nascent peptide. This study suggests that the 9-oxime acylides possess a bactericidal mechanism that is different from the traditional near-complete inhibition of protein synthesis. These studies provide a foundation for the rational design of macrolide antibiotics.
