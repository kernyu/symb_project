Endogenous endophthalmitis is a rare but potentially blinding complication of neonatal sepsis. Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment are essential to avoid vision loss. Therapeutic options include systemic and intravitreal antibiotics, as well as vitrectomy in selected cases. We report a series of 6 premature very low birth weight neonates who developed endogenous endophthalmitis in our NICU over the past 3 years. Endophthalmitis was part of early-onset sepsis in 2 newborns, both of whom died, and late-onset sepsis in 4 newborns, of which 1 infant died. None of the neonates had any history of previous trauma or intervention to the eye. Maternal screening for congenital infections, including HIV, was negative in all. Causative organisms included Klebsiella pneumoniae (2 cases), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2 cases), Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (1 case), and Candida albicans (1 case). All bacterial isolates showed resistance to first-line antibiotics. Of the 3 survivors, 2 infants had normal vision in the affected eye, and 1 developed phthisis bulbi after corneal perforation and required enucleation. This report draws attention to the emergence of endophthalmitis as a complication of neonatal sepsis in places where, although survival of very low birth weight newborns has increased significantly due to improved care, the burden of infection continues to be high. We emphasize the importance of daily examination of eyes as a part of routine clinical care in septic newborns for early diagnosis of endophthalmitis and prompt intervention in consultation with an ophthalmologist to optimize the outcome.
