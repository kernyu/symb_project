FPH-1 is a new class A carbapenemase from Francisella philomiragia. It produces high-level resistance to penicillins and the narrow-spectrum cephalosporin cephalothin and hydrolyzes these beta-lactam antibiotics with catalytic efficiencies of 10(6) to 10(7) M(-1) s(-1). When expressed in Escherichia coli, the enzyme confers resistance to clavulanic acid, tazobactam, and sulbactam and has K(i) values of 7.5, 4, and 220 muM, respectively, against these inhibitors. FPH-1 increases the MIC of the monobactam aztreonam 256-fold and the MIC of the broad-spectrum cephalosporin ceftazidime 128-fold, while the MIC of cefoxitin remains unchanged. MICs of the carbapenem antibiotics imipenem, meropenem, doripenem, and ertapenem are elevated 8-, 8-, 16-, and 64-fold, respectively, against an E. coli JM83 strain producing the FPH-1 carbapenemase. The catalytic efficiencies of the enzyme against carbapenems are in the range of 10(4) to 10(5) M(-1) s(-1). FPH-1 is 77% identical to the FTU-1 beta-lactamase from Francisella tularensis and has low amino acid sequence identity with other class A beta-lactamases. Together with FTU-1, FPH-1 constitutes a new branch of the prolific and ever-expanding class A beta-lactamase tree.
