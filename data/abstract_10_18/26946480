OBJECTIVE: Whether minocycline can replace tetracycline in Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication remains unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy, safety, patient compliance and risk factors of a combination regimen of esomeprazole, minocycline, metronidazole and bismuth (EMMB) for H. pylori eradication. METHODS: In this prospective single-center study, 152 patients in the first-line therapy group and 64 in the second-line therapy group received EMMB therapy (esomeprazole 20 mg twice daily, minocycline 100 mg twice daily, metronidazole 400 mg four times daily and bismuth potassium citrate 110 mg four times daily) for 14 days. The eradication outcome was assessed by (13) C-urea breath test 6-12 weeks after treatment. RESULTS: EMMB therapy achieved eradication rates of 85.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) 79.6-91.4%] using intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, 90.3% (95% CI 84.7-95.1%) using modified intention-to-treat (mITT) analysis and 92.6% (95% CI 88.1-96.3%) using per-protocol (PP) analysis as the first-line therapy; and 82.8% (95% CI 71.9-90.6%), 86.9% (95% CI 77.1-95.1%) and 89.5% (95% CI 80.7-96.5%) as the second-line therapy, respectively. In the first-line group, 35.6% of the patients experienced adverse effects, 4.7% discontinued medications because of adverse effects and good compliance was achieved in 91.3%, while the results were 36.5%, 3.2% and 90.5% in the second-line therapy group. Poor compliance was identified as an independent predictor of treatment failure. CONCLUSION: The efficacy of EMMB therapy for H. pylori eradication as first-line and second-line regimens in a region with high rates of antibiotic resistance is satisfactory with relatively good patient compliance and high safety.
