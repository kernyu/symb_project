Arginine polymer based coatings with switchable properties were developed on glass slides (GS) to demonstrate the smart transition from antimicrobial (cationic) to fouling-resistant (zwitterionic) surfaces. l-Arginine methyl ester-methacryloylamide (Arg-Est) and l-arginine-methacryloylamide (Arg-Me) polymer brushes were grafted from the GS surface via surface-initiated reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer (SI-RAFT) polymerization. In comparison to the pristine GS and Arg-Me graft polymerized GS (GS-Arg-Me) surfaces, the Arg-Est polymer brushes-functionalized GS surfaces exhibit a superior antimicrobial activity. Upon hydrolysis treatment, the strong bactericidal efficacy switches to good resistance to adsorption of bovine serum albumin (BSA), the adhesion of Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, as well as the attachment of Amphora coffeaeformis. In addition, the switchable coatings are proven to be biocompatible. The stability and durability of the switchable coatings are also ascertained after exposure to filtered seawater for 30 days. Therefore, deposition of the proposed "smart coatings" offers another environmentally friendly alternative for combating biofouling.
