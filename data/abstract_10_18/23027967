Staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan (PG) is densely functionalized with anionic polymers called wall teichoic acids (WTAs). These polymers contain three tailoring modifications: d-alanylation, alpha-O-GlcNAcylation, and beta-O-GlcNAcylation. Here we describe the discovery and biochemical characterization of a unique glycosyltransferase, TarS, that attaches beta-O-GlcNAc (beta-O-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine) residues to S. aureus WTAs. We report that methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is sensitized to beta-lactams upon tarS deletion. Unlike strains completely lacking WTAs, which are also sensitive to beta-lactams, DeltatarS strains have no growth or cell division defects. Because neither alpha-O-GlcNAc nor beta-O-Glucose modifications can confer resistance, the resistance phenotype requires a highly specific chemical modification of the WTA backbone, beta-O-GlcNAc residues. These data suggest beta-O-GlcNAcylated WTAs scaffold factors required for MRSA resistance. The beta-O-GlcNAc transferase identified here, TarS, is a unique target for antimicrobials that sensitize MRSA to beta-lactams.
