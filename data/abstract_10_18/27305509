OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to analyze the characteristics of patients with acute prostatitis presenting to the Emergency Department, the microbiological findings, antibiotic susceptibility, and bacteraemia associated factors. METHODS: Observational and cohort study with prospective follow-up including patients with acute prostatitis presenting to the Emergency Department from January-December 2012. Data were collected for demographic variables, comorbidities, microbiological findings, antibiotic treatment and outcome. RESULTS: Two hundred and forty one episodes of acute prostatitis were included. Mean age was 62.9 +/- 16 years, a history of prostate adenoma was reported in 54 cases (22.5%) and prior manipulation of the lower urinary tract in 40 (17%). Mean symptoms duration was 3.38 +/- 4.04 days, voiding symptoms were present in 176 cases (73%) and fever in 154 (64%). Seventy patients (29%) were admitted to the hospital and 3 died. From 216 urine cultures, 128 were positive (59%) and 24 (17.6%) out of 136 blood cultures. Escherichia coli was the main pathogen (58.6% of urine cultures and 64% of blood cultures) with resistant strains to fluoroquinolones, cotrimoxazole and amoxicillin/clavulanic in 27.7%, 22.9% and 27.7% of cases respectively. In the univariate analysis, only chills were associated to bacteraemia (p=0.013). At 30-day follow-up, patients with bacteraemia returned more frequently to the Emergency Department (p=0.037) and were more often admitted to the hospital (p=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with acute prostatitis discharged from the Emergency Department need clinical follow-up and monitoring of microbiological findings in order to assure an adequate antibiotic treatment. Return to Emergency Department and admission to the hospital were significantly more frequent among patients with bacteraemia.
