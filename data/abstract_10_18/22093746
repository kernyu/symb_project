The serine-threonine-specific protein phosphatase calcineurin is a key mediator of various stress responses in fungi. Herein, we characterized functions of the endogenous regulators of calcineurin (RCNs), Rcn1 and Rcn2, in the pathogenic fungus Candida glabrata. Rcn1 exerted both inhibitory and stimulatory effects on calcineurin signaling, but Rcn2 displayed only inhibitory activity. Phenotypic analyses of C. glabrata strains lacking either RCNs, calcineurin, or both revealed that calcineurin requires Rcn1, but not Rcn2, for antifungal tolerance in C. glabrata.
