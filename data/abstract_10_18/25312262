PURPOSE: To describe antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) of acute and long-term acute care (LTAC) hospitals in Houston, Texas. METHODS: Two-part survey to clinical pharmacists and pharmacy directors. All acute care and LTAC facilities from the Harris County Medical Society database were invited to participate. RESULTS: In part 1 of the telephone survey, 82 facilities within Houston, Harris county, were contacted by telephone of which 51 responded (response rate: 62%). Of respondents, 55% (n = 28) reported having an active ASP and 8% (n = 4) planned implementation within 12 months. Acute care and LTAC hospitals reported ASPs in 57% and 67% of facilities, respectively. Physician champions were involved in 71% (n = 20) of active ASPs; clinical pharmacists were involved in 75% (n = 21) of programs. In part II, 22 (43%) facilities completed the online survey; postprescription review with feedback was used in facilities with an ASP and medical training program (5 of 5) while formulary restriction was in facilities without stewardship or medical training (6 of 8). CONCLUSION: This is the first major survey of ASP in a major metropolitan area. The stewardship effort in the city of Houston is encouraging; we expect the number of stewardship programs in all facilities will continue to rise as focus on antimicrobial resistance grows.
