This work describes the draft genome sequence of Lactococcus garvieae IPLA 31405, isolated from a traditional Spanish cheese. The genome contains a lactose-galactose operon, a bacteriocin locus, two integrated phages, a transposon harboring an active tet(M) gene, and two theta-type plasmid replicons. Genes encoding virulence factors were not recorded.
