We report the first case of spontaneous intrapartum Atopobium vaginae bacteremia identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The bacterium was misidentified by RapID ANA II, API Rapid ID 32A, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The likely source of bacteremia was the female genital tract. In invasive infections caused by A. vaginae, beta-lactams and clindamycin are the antibiotics of choice, as most strains are resistant to metronidazole.
