BACKGROUND: Results of our previous studies demonstrated that the expression of heat-shock protein 27 (HSP27) was increased and HSP27 was phosphorylated in the GEM-resistant pancreatic cancer cell line, KLM1-R. The expression of HSP27 is regulated mainly by heat-shock factor 1, but other transcription factors or kinases have been reported to activate HSP27. High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a nuclear transcription factor. It has been reported that HMGB1 regulates HSP27 gene expression. Mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-2 (MAPKAPK2) phosphorylates HSP27. In the present study, we investigated the expression of HMGB1 and MAPKAPK2 in KLM1-R cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression levels of HMGB1 and MAPKAPK2 were compared between KLM1 and KLM1-R cells by western blotting. RESULTS: The protein expression of both HMGB1 and MAPKAPK2 were increased in KLM1-R cells compared to KLM1 cells. CONCLUSION: The increase of both HMGB1 and MAPKAPK2 in KLM1-R cells compared to KLM1 suggest the possibility of the activation of the pathway of HSP27 by HMGB1 and MAPKAPK2 in gemcitabine-resistant KLM1-R cells.
