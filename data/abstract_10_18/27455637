In the clinical practice, resistance of Candida albicans to antifungal agents has frequently emerged. Silver-nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) have been demonstrated to have the antifungal property. We investigated the potential for synergy between polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-coated Ag-NPs and azole antifungal, such as fluconazole or voriconazole, against drug-resistant C. albicans strain CA10. When antifungal agent was examined alone, fluconazole and voriconazole did not kill drug-resistant C. albicans, and PVP-coated Ag-NPs had only the moderate killing ability. In contrast, the combinational treatment of PVP-coated Ag-NPs with fluconazole or voriconazole was effective in being against the drug-resistant C. albicans. After the combinational treatment, we detected the disruption of cell membrane integrity, the tendency of PVP-coated Ag-NPs to adhere to cell membrane, and the inhibition of budding process. Moreover, after the combinational treatment, the defects in ergosterol signaling and efflux pump functions were detected. Our results suggest that the combinational use of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs), such as PVP-coated Ag-NPs, with the conventional antifungal may be a viable strategy to combat drug-resistant fungal infection.
