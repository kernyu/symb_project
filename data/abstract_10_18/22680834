BACKGROUND: The aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae in residents living in Swedish nursing homes, and if carriage of resistant bacteria was related to antibiotic treatment, other risk factors, and/or staff's adherence to guidelines for infection control. METHODS: Five hundred and sixty residents from 9 nursing homes on a total of 67 wards participated in the study and had microbiological cultures taken. Faecal samples were obtained from 495 residents (88.3%). ESBL-positive residents were followed for 2 y with repeated sampling. Two hundred and ninety-six [corrected] staff members were interviewed and observed regarding familiarity with and adherence to infection control guidelines. RESULTS: No resident was positive for MRSA or VRE. Fifteen of the residents were found to be ESBL-positive. Residents living on wards where ESBL-positive residents were identified had been treated more frequently with antibiotics (42%), compared to those on wards where no residents with ESBL were found (28%; p = 0.02). ESBL-positive Escherichia coli isolates from residents living in adjacent rooms were found to be closely genetically related when analysed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, indicating transmission between residents. Staff adherence to infection control guidelines sometimes revealed shortcomings, but no significant differences regarding compliance to the guidelines could be found. CONCLUSION: Carriage of resistant bacteria was uncommon and only ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae were identified in Swedish nursing homes. Usage of antibiotics was higher on wards where ESBL-positive residents were detected and there was an indication of transmission of ESBL between residents.
