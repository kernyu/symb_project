In this study, we investigated the biofilm formation in strains of Candida albicans susceptible (CO23) or resistant to fluconazole (CO23RFLC) or micafungin (CO23RFK). The effect of drug resistance on biofilm formation was investigated through the cell surface hydrophobicity and the mannan content. Moreover, biofilm formation was evaluated after 24, 48 and 72 hours with crystal violet assay, dry weight, as well as scanning electron microscopy. Our results showed an increase in hydrophobicity, polysaccharides content, metabolic activity and dry weight. Observation of sensitive and resistant strains confirmed the differences in cell morphology. Finally, the expression of genes involved in biofilm formation, such as HWP1 and EFG1, evaluated with relative real-time RT-PCR. Resistant strains proved to up- regulate the expression of HWP1. These results demonstrated the existence of important differences between drug-susceptible and drug-resistant strains biofilm of C. albicans.
