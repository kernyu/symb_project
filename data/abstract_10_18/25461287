UNLABELLED: Nitric oxide (NO), an essential agent of the innate immune system, exhibits multi-mechanistic antimicrobial activity. Previously, NO-releasing nanoparticles (NO-np) demonstrated increased antimicrobial activity when combined with glutathione (GSH) due to formation of S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), a transnitrosylating agent. To capitalize on this finding, we incorporated the thiol-containing ACE-inhibitor, captopril, with NO-np to form SNO-CAP-np, nanoparticles that both release NO and form S-nitrosocaptopril. In the presence of GSH, SNO-CAP-np demonstrated increased transnitrosylation activity compared to NO-np, as exhibited by increased GSNO formation. Escherichia coli and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were highly susceptible to SNO-CAP-np in a dose-dependent fashion, with E. coli being most susceptible, and SNO-CAP-np were nontoxic in zebrafish embryos at translatable concentrations. Given SNO-CAP-np's increased transnitrosylation activity and increased E. coli susceptibility compared to NO-np, transnitrosylation rather than free NO is likely responsible for overcoming E. coli's resistance mechanisms and ultimately killing the pathogen. FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: This team of authors incorporated the thiol-containing ACE-inhibitor, captopril, into a nitric oxide releasing nanoparticle system, generating nanoparticles that both release NO and form S-nitrosocaptopril, with pronounced toxic effects on MRSA and E. coli in the presented model system.
