Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are potent and well tolerated. In Brazil, the first-generation NNRTI efavirenz is included in the majority of first-line antiretroviral treatment regimens. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of etravirine, a new second-generation NNRTI, among patients failing antiretroviral regimens containing first-generation NNRTIs. We assessed single resistance mutations to etravirine as well as complex resistance mutations profile and discuss the potential of introducing etravirine as salvage therapy.
