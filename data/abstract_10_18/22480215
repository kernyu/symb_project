CONTEXT: Cecropia glaziovii Snethl. (Cecropiaceae), commonly known as "embauba-vermelha", is widely distributed throughout Latin America and has been reported in Brazilian folk medicine to treat cough, asthma, high blood pressure and inflammation. OBJECTIVE: Investigate the hepatoprotective properties of crude hydroethanolic extract of C. glaziovii as well as its in vitro antioxidant and antiviral (HSV-1 acyclovir resistant strain) activities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The hepatoprotective effect, the antioxidant properties and antiviral activity of crude hydroethanol extract (RCE40) from C. glaziovii leaves were evaluated by carbon-tetrachloride (CCl(4))-induced hepatotoxicity, by TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive species) and MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide] assays, respectively. RESULTS: The RCE40 extract (20 mg/kg) inhibited lipid peroxidation on liver in post injury treatment and decreased serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). In addition, in this protocol the RCE40 (20 mg/kg) enhanced the activity of hepatic enzymes (SOD/CAT) which are involved in combating reactive oxygen species (ROS), suggesting that it possesses the capacity to attenuate the CCl(4)-induced liver damage. Moreover the RCE40 (20 mg/kg) inhibited TBARS formation induced by several different inductors of oxidative stress showing significant antioxidant activity, including physiologically relevant concentration, as low as 2 microg/mL. Concerning antiviral activity, the RCE40 was effective against herpes simplex virus type 1 replication (29R acyclovir resistant strain) with EC(50) = 40 microg/mL and selective index (SI) = 50. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: These results indicate that C. glaziovii could be a good source of antioxidant and anti-HSV-1 lead compounds.
