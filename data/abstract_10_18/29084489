In this study, the effects of oligochitosan treatment on controlling postharvest diseases in Dongxue peach ( Prunus Persica L. Batsch, cv Dongxuemi) were examined and the possible underlying mechanisms were discussed. Results showed that the disease incidence and lesion area in peach fruit inoculated with Monilinia fructicola and Penicillium expansum were all remarkably reduced by oligochitosan treatment. Oligochitosan treatment inhibited spore germination and mycelial growth of the two fungi in vitro. Oligochitosan treatment also induced upregulation of the salicylic acid signalling pathway-related genes (NPR1, PR1 and phenylalanine ammonia lyase) and enhanced the levels of total phenolics, flavonoids and lignin in peach. Meanwhile, enzymatic activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, polyphenoloxidase, ascorbate peroxidase and phenylalanine ammonia lyase also increased. These findings suggest that the effects of oligochitosan on the disease control of peach fruit may be associated with its direct antimicrobial effects as well as increasing antioxidant, phenylpropanoid metabolism and accumulating antifungal compounds by activating the salicylic acid-dependent pathway.
