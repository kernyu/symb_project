INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to assess the resistance to cyclic fatigue of three nickel-titanium (NiTi) files after the immersion in sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) solution in conditions similar to those used in clinical practice. METHODS: A total of 150 new Twisted Files (SybronEndo, Orange, CA), Revo S SU files (Micro Mega, Besancon, France), and Mtwo files (Sweden and Martina, Padova, Italy), size 25.06, were tested. Fifty files of the same brand were randomly assigned to five groups (n = 10) and submitted to the following immersion protocol in 5% NaOCl at 37 degrees C for 16 mm: no immersion (control), 5 minutes statically, 1 minute statically, 5 minutes dynamically (300 rpm/min), and 1 minute dynamically. Resistance to cyclic fatigue was determined by counting the numbers of cycles to failure in a 60 degrees curve with a 5-mm radius. Data were analyzed by two-way analyses of variance. RESULTS: Resistance to cyclic fatigue of the same NiTi file was not significantly affected by immersion in NaOCl (P > .05). The Twisted File showed a higher resistance in all groups than Revo S SU (P < .001). The comparison between the same groups of Twisted Files and Mtwo files or between Mtwo and Revo S files did not show significant differences (P > .05) except for two cases: group 2 of the Twisted Files and Mtwo files and group 5 of the Mtwo and Revo S SU files (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Static or dynamic immersion in NaOCl for 1 minute or 5 minutes did not reduce the cyclic fatigue resistance of NiTi significantly. However, the type of instrument influences cyclic fatigue resistance. In our study, Twisted Files were more resistant followed by Mtwo and Revo S SU files.
