Reduced susceptibility to metronidazole and vancomycin in Clostridium difficile has been reported, which emphasises the need for simple antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods. The aim of this study was to apply a published disc diffusion method and zone diameter breakpoint correlates to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) epidemiological minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) cut-off values in a routine setting. Metronidazole and vancomycin zone diameters from 2702 isolates were recorded. Fifteen isolates had a metronidazole zone diameter below the published breakpoint (<23 mm) and five isolates had a vancomycin zone diameter below the published breakpoint (<19 mm), most of which were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ribotype 027. The total number of PCR ribotype 027 was 29 (1.1 %). Overall, C. difficile PCR ribotype 027 isolates had smaller zone diameters than non-027 isolates. The disc diffusion method is very simple and inexpensive, and the published zone diameter breakpoints will detect C. difficile isolates with reduced susceptibility to metronidazole and vancomycin.
