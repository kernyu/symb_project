We designed an efficient transformation system for Candida guilliermondii wild-type strains. We demonstrated that the Staphylococcus aureus MRSA 252 ble coding sequence placed under the control of the yeast phosphoglycerate kinase gene transcription-regulating regions confers phleomycin resistance to transformed C. guilliermondii cells. To illustrate the potential of this drug-resistant cassette, we carried out the disruption of the C. guilliermondii ADE2 gene. This new dominant selectable marker represents a powerful tool to study the function of various genes in this yeast of clinical and biotechnological interest.
