A variety of antibiotics and their metabolites at sub-inhibitory level concentrations are suspected to expand resistance genes in the environment. However, knowledge is limited on the causal correlation of trace antibiotics or their metabolites with resistance proliferation. In this study, erythromycin (ERY) resistance genes were screened on microbial consortia of sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) after one year acclimation to ERY (100 mug/L) or dehydrated erythromycin (ERY-H(2)O, 50 mug/L). The identified esterase gene ereA explains that ERY could be degraded to six products by microbes acclimated to ERY (100 mug/L). However, ERY could not be degraded by microbes acclimated to ERY-H(2)O (50 mug/L), which may be due to the less proliferated ereA gene. Biodegradation of ERY required the presence of exogenous carbon source (e.g., glucose) and nutrients (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus) for assimilation, but overdosed ammonium-N (>40 mg/L) inhibited degradation of ERY. Zoogloea, a kind of biofilm formation bacteria, became predominant in the ERY degradation consortia, suggesting that the input of ERY could induce biofilm resistance to antibiotics. Our study highlights that lower mug/L level of ERY or ERY-H(2)O in the environment encourages expansion of resistance genes in microbes.
