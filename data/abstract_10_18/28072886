The genetic analysis of THE natural protease inhibitors (PI) resistance of HCV genotype (GT)1 involves subtypes 1a and 1b. NS3 protease domain was sequentially analysed in 10 HIV/HCV GT1-coinfected individuals naive to HCV treatment. Analysis at different time points showed that 2/3 GT1b patients were infected by a GT1a clade1 during follow-up. In one patient a switch from clade1 to clade2 and in one other patient a switch from clade2 to clade1 was revealed. Four out of ten patients had resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) at baseline. The dynamics of the dominant infecting subtype suggests the presence of mixed infection in some patients.
