Thermoresponsive polymers have potential biomedical applications for drug delivery and tissue engineering. Here, two thermoresponsive oligomers were synthesized, viz. oligo(N-isopropylacrylamide) (ONIPAM) and oligo(N-vinylcaprolactam) (OVCL), and their anti-biofouling abilities investigated against enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7, which produces Shiga-like toxins and forms biofilms. Biofilm formation (biofouling) is closely related to E. coli O157:H7 infection and constitutes a major mechanism of antimicrobial resistance. The synthetic OVCL (MW 679) and three commercial OVCLs (up to MW 54,000) at 30 mug ml(-1) were found to inhibit biofouling by E. coli O157:H7 at 37 degrees C by more than 80% without adversely affecting bacterial growth. The anti-biofouling activity of ONIPAM was weaker than that of OVCL. However, at 25 degrees C, ONIPAM and OVCL did not affect E. coli O157:H7 biofouling. Transcriptional analysis showed that OVCL temperature-dependently downregulated curli genes in E. coli O157:H7, and this finding was in line with observed reductions in fimbriae production and biofouling. In addition, OVCL downregulated the Shiga-like toxin genes stx1 and stx2 in E. coli O157:H7 and attenuated its in vivo virulence in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. These results suggest that OVCL has potential use in antivirulence strategies against persistent E. coli O157:H7 infection.
