Alanine substitutions and selected deletions have been used to localize amino acids in QnrB essential for its protective activity. Essential amino acids are found at positions i and i(-2) in the pentapeptide repeat module and in the larger of two loops, where deletion of only a single amino acid compromises activity. Deletion of 10 amino acids at the N terminus is tolerated, but removal of 3 amino acids in the C-terminal dimerization unit destroys activity.
