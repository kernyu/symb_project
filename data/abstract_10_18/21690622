We used daptomycin plus antistaphylococcal beta-lactams (ASBL) to clear refractory MRSA bacteremia. In vitro studies showed enhanced daptomycin bactericidal activity, increased membrane daptomycin binding, and decrease in positive surface charge induced by ASBLs against daptomycin nonsusceptible MRSA. Addition of ASBLs to daptomycin may be of benefit in refractory MRSA bacteremia. (Although the official designation is "daptomycin nonsusceptiblity," we will use the term "daptomycin-resistance" in this paper for facility of presentation.).
