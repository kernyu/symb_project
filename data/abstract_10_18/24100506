Treatment strategies for entecavir (ETV)-resistant chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients are not yet well established. The aim of this study was to evaluate overall antiviral efficacy and to compare the efficacy of combination therapy with adefovir (ADV) plus nucleoside analogues (lamivudine [LAM], telbivudine [LdT], or ETV) in patients infected with LAM- and ETV-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) variants. Virologic, biochemical, and serologic responses during combination therapy with ADV plus nucleoside analogues were assessed. Propensity score analysis was used to select a matched group of patients for the comparison of rescue therapy regimens. A total of 67 consecutive patients were analyzed. Complete virologic suppression was achieved in 27 patients. The overall cumulative incidence of complete virologic suppression at month 24 was 47.4%: 44.3% in the LAM or LdT plus ADV group and 51.4% in the group given ETV and ADV. There was no significant difference between these two groups (P = 0.234). The cumulative incidences of complete virologic suppression were still comparable between the two groups selected and matched using the propensity score model (P = 0.419). Virologic breakthrough was observed in 9 patients, and rtA181V substitution was newly detected in one patient. Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) negativity and lower baseline HBV DNA level were associated with complete virologic suppression in univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, lower baseline HBV DNA level remained an independent predictor. In conclusion, combination therapy with ADV plus nucleoside analogues fails to show sufficient antiviral efficacy in CHB patients with resistance to both LAM and ETV. Further study is warranted to evaluate the efficacy of a more potent tenofovir-based regimen in such patients.
