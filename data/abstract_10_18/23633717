A great Dane dog was presented with a small, superficial wound on the left tarsus that rapidly progressed to a large necrotic area. The dog had undergone radiation therapy in the left tarsal region 33 months previously. Necrotizing fasciitis was diagnosed on histopathological examination, and bacterial culture revealed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius.
