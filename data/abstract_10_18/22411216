The emergence of bacterial resistance to commercial antibiotics is an issue of global importance. During the last two decades, the number of antibacterial agents that have been discovered and introduced into the market has steadily declined and failed to meet the challenges posed by rapidly increasing resistance of the pathogens against common antibacterial drugs. The development of new classes of compounds to control the virulence of the pathogens is therefore urgently required. This perspective describes the historical development in brief and recent advances on the preparation of small organometallic compounds as new classes of antibacterial agents with potential for clinical development.
