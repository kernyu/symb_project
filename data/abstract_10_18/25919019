There are limited data regarding the prevalence of vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA)/heterogeneous VISA (hVISA) among pediatric population. Our objective was to determine the distribution of vancomycin and daptomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and explore the phenomenon of vancomycin MIC creep and the VISA/hVISA prevalence among the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains belonging to pediatric population by population analysis profile-area under the curve (PAP-AUC) and Etest macromethod. Vancomycin and daptomycin susceptibilities of 94 pediatric isolates of MRSA were tested by broth microdilution (BMD) and Etest methods. To determine the prevalence of VISA/hVISA, Etest macromethod and PAP-AUC was performed on all isolates. All isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and daptomycin by both BMD and Etest methods. Twenty-eight (29.8%) isolates had vancomycin MICs of 2 mug/ml by BMD. No increase in vancomycin MICs was observed over time. There were no VISA among 94 MRSA tested but 20 (21.3%) hVISA isolates were identified by PAP-AUC. Results of Etest macromethod were compared to PAP-AUC. Etest macromethod was 60.0% sensitive and 90.5% specific. The hVISA isolates represented 53.6% of isolates with vancomycin MICs of 2 mug/ml. Also, 75% of hVISA isolates had vancomycin MICs of 2 mug/ml. To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the prevalence of VISA/hVISA among MRSA isolated from pediatric patients by PAP-AUC method. Based on our findings, MRSA isolates, which have vancomycin MIC of 2 mug/ml can be investigated for the presence of hVISA. In this study, daptomycin showed potent activity against all isolates and may represent a therapeutic option for MRSA infections.
