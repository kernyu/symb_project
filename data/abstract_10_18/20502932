In this study, we clinically reviewed 13 patients with Proteus mirabilis pneumonia who were admitted for treatment to Kawasaki Medical School Kawasaki Hospital, Okayama, Japan, between April 2006 and July 2009. Clinical features were retrospectively reviewed. Results showed that: (1) hospital-acquired pneumonia occurred in elderly patients with underlying diseases such as cerebrovascular disease; (2) some patients had complications of urinary tract infection due to P. mirabilis; (3) preadministration of antibacterial agents did not become a risk factor; (4) resistance for levofloxacin (LVFX) was observed; (5) prognosis was comparatively good (effective rate 84.7%).
