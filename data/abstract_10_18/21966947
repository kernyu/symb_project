Alternative treatments for seborrhoeic dermatitis are needed because of the increasing risk of anti-fungal resistance to existing therapies. To investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of topical scalp treatment with K301 solution. Two multi-centre, randomised, double-blind studies were conducted. Study I: 4 weeks of once-daily treatment with either one form of K301 (a or b) or placebo, followed by 4 weeks of maintenance treatment three times-per-week. Study II: 4 weeks of K301 (a) or placebo once-daily. Study I: 98 patients enrolled (K301a + b, n = 51; placebo, n = 47) and 83 completed; 201 entered Study II (K301a, n = 136; placebo, n = 65) and 195 completed. Erythema and desquamation sum score at 4 weeks, mean (SD) values were 2.4 (2.0) for K301a + b and 3.2 (2.2) for placebo in Study I (P = 0.025) and 2.5 (1.9) for K301a and 3.2 (1.8) for placebo in Study II (not significant). In both studies, 4-week desquamation scores were significantly improved for K301 vs. placebo (P < 0.05). Both studies showed significant improvements in symptomatic investigator and patient assessments for K301 over placebo after 4 weeks (P < 0.05). Treatment-related adverse events were generally mild and included some smarting or burning upon application. The K301 was well tolerated and associated with clinically meaningful improvements in seborrhoeic dermatitis endpoints.
