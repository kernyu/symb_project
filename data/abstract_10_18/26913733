BACKGROUND: Compare to high-income settings, survival in burn units in low-income settings is lower with invasive infections one leading cause of death. Medecins Sans Frontieres is involved in the treatment of large burns in adults and children in Haiti. METHODS: In 2014, we performed a review of 228 patients admitted consecutively with burn injury during a 6-month period to determine patient outcomes and infectious complications. Microbiology was available through a linkage with a Haitian organization. Regression analysis was performed to determine covariates associated with bloodstream infection and mortality. RESULTS: 102 (45 %) patients were male, the median age was 8 years (IQR, 2-28), and the majority of patients (60 %) were admitted to the unit within 6 h of injury. There were 20 patients (9 %) with culture-proven bacteremia. Among organisms in blood, common isolates were Staphylococcus aureus (42 %), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (23 %), and Acinetobacter baumannii (15 %). Among patients with burns involving <40 % total body area, 4 (2 %) of 192 died and 20 (65 %) of 31 with >/=40 % body surface area involvement died. Factors associated with mortality included involvement of >/=40 % of body surface, depth, and flame as the mechanism. Multidrug-resistant infections were common; 18 % of S. aureus isolates were methicillin resistant, and 83 % of P. aeruginosa isolates were imipenem resistant. CONCLUSIONS: A low mortality rate was observed in a humanitarian burn surgery project in patients with burns involving <40 % of total body surface. Invasive infection was common and alarming rates of antibiotic resistance were observed, including infections not treatable with antibiotics available locally.
