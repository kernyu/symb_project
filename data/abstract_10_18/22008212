SUMMARY Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) commonly causes infection in hospitalized patients. Resistance is due to the acquisition of mecA gene located on the chromosomal element SCCmec and to date 12 types have been identified. Specific epidemic clones of MRSA have emerged with enhanced ability to spread within and among hospitals and to cross national boundaries. We studied 30 isolates from patients with MRSA infections at two hospitals in Porto Alegre city from April to December, 2008 and determined their SCCmec type by PCR. Representative strains were typed by PFGE. Eighteen (60%) isolates carried SCCmec type III and had PFGE profiles clonally related to the previously characterized Brazilian epidemic clone, and 11 (36.7%) isolates with pulsotypes closely related to the Cordobes/Chilean clone harboured SCCmec type I. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the appearance of Cordobes/Chilean clone involved in nosocomial infection in Brazil.
