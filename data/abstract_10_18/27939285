A MALDI-TOF MS(1)-based imipenem hydrolysis assay was modified by adding ZnSO4. This improved detection of metallo-beta-lactamase producing strains without compromising detection of other carbapenemase types. Using 129 genetically characterized Gram-negative bacilli, the sensitivity and specificity were 98.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 91.9-99.7%) and 100% (95% CI: 94.3-100%), respectively.
