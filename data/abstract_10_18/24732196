Helicobacter pylori infection has been recognized as the main trigger of stomach-related diseases. The huge variation in H. pylori infection patterns across the globe requires targeted research and close monitoring of this infection in different regions. The Baltic countries have witnessed enormous changes in socioeconomic conditions in the last years. Evolution of H. pylori infection and related diseases has been a key interest of gastroenterology centers in the Baltic States over the last two decades, translating into up-to-date scientific data that are valuable locally and on the European level. The East-West gradient in the prevalence of H. pylori infection is still evident in the Baltic countries, but the gap is becoming smaller, and similar trends are expected for the coming years. Clarithromycin-based triple therapy remains the first-line treatment of H. pylori in the region; however, careful monitoring of resistance rates in the future remains highly relevant, though routine resistance testing is not available in all the countries. A high prevalence of gastric cancer is still notable in the Baltic States; nevertheless, a steady decline in gastric cancer incidence in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia is present and expected to be continuing during the coming decades. Currently, H. pylori-related diseases still constitute a substantial part of gastroenterologists' workload in the region. This paper reviews epidemiological, diagnostic, treatment as well as basic research trends on H. pylori infection and related diseases in the Baltic States during the last two decades.
