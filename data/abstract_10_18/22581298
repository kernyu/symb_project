To aid the diagnosis of anthelmintic resistance, a range of in vivo and in vitro techniques have been developed. Amongst in vitro techniques, the larval development test is the most widely employed. Six lambs were infected with susceptible (three) and ivermectin-resistant (three) isolates of Haemonchus contortus. The micro-agar larval development test (MALDT) was able to easily distinguish between susceptible and resistant isolates. Different proportions of resistant and susceptible eggs were subsequently incubated, i.e. development to the third larval stage occurred only in the resistant isolate. The percentage of resistant eggs ranged from 2 to 20.0 % of all eggs in the wells. In all cases, the MALDT was able to detect the presence of a minimum of 10 % of resistant worms amongst a susceptible background population. The probability was approximately 87 % of positively diagnosing a proportion of resistant worms of only 2-4 % within the population.
