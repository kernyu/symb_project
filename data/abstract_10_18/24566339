The emergence and spread of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in Gram-negative bacteria pose important challenges for clinicians, as management options for these organisms are limited. The emergence of ESBL-producing Gram-negative bacteria is one of the most significant epidemiologic changes in infectious diseases during recent years. Failure to treat with an antibiotic active against ESBL-producing organisms is associated with increased patient morbidity and mortality. Carbapenems are considered the primary antibacterials for infections caused by ESBL-producing organisms but their overuse poses significant cause for concern.
