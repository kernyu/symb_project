The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) has been demonstrated to mediate multidrug resistance in various tumors by inducing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) overexpression. Here, we investigated the correlation between the mTOR pathway and P-gp expression in pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Temporal cortex specimens were obtained from patients with refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) and age-matched controls who underwent surgeries at West China Hospital of Sichuan University between June 2014 and May 2015. We established a rat model of epilepsy kindled by coriaria lactone (CL) and screened pharmacoresistant rats (non-responders) using phenytoin. Non-responders were treated for 4 weeks with vehicle only or with the mTOR pathway inhibitor rapamycin at doses of 1, 3, and 6 mg/kg. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the expression of phospho-S6 (P-S6) and P-gp at different time points (1 h, 8 h, 1 day, 3 days, 1 weeks, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks) after the onset of treatment. Overexpression of P-S6 and P-gp was detected in both refractory mTLE patients and non-responder rats. Rapamycin showed an inhibitory effect on P-S6 and P-gp expression 1 week after treatment in rats. In addition, the expression levels of P-S6 and P-gp in the 6 mg/kg group were significantly lower than those in the 1 mg/kg or the 3 mg/kg group at the same time points (all P < 0.05). Moreover, rapamycin decreased the duration and number of CL-induced seizures, as well as the stage of non-responders (all P < 0.05). The current study indicates that the mTOR signaling pathway plays a critical role in P-gp expression in drug-resistant epilepsy. Inhibition of the mTOR pathway by rapamycin may be a potential therapeutic approach for pharmacoresistant epilepsy.
