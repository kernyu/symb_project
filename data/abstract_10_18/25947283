The long-term outcome of multiple myeloma (MM) has been greatly improved through new agents, one being lenalidomide (LEN). Based upon the findings of in vitro experiments, its mode of action against MM occurs through a combination of direct tumoricidal effects on myeloma cells, modulatory effects on tumor immunity and tumor microenvironment-regulatory effects. However, it has not been clearly defined whether the clinical response and long-term outcome of MM with LEN treatment truly reflect the mechanisms of action of LEN proposed by in vitro studies. To ascertain what is known and what remains to be elucidated with LEN, we review the current literature on the mode of action of LEN in association with myeloma pathophysiology, and discuss the prognostic indicators in the treatment of MM with LEN.
