INTRODUCTION: There has been a dramatic increase in the incidence of multidrug-resistant pathogens over the past few years, which highlights the need for new anti-infective therapeutics. Eravacycline is a novel, broad-spectrum synthetic tetracycline indicated for the treatment of severe infections caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. AREAS COVERED: In this review, the authors report eravacycline's pharmacokinetic characteristics and its microbiological spectrum of activity. Furthermore, the authors also highlight the safety and efficacy data from the recent studies on urinary and intra-abdominal infections. EXPERT OPINION: The profile of eravacycline offers several advantages. Indeed, eravacycline has a broad-spectrum activity toward pathogens involved in complicated urinary tract (cUTIs) and intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs), including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. The availability of an oral formulation supports eravacycline's possible use in sequential therapy. High urinary concentrations favor its use in cUTIs and may reduce the overuse of other antimicrobials that may select resistance, such as carbapenems. Eravacycline efficacy and tolerability have been investigated in a Phase II clinical trial in cIAIs comparing two dosages of eravacycline with ertapenem, showing comparable efficacy among the three arms and a low rate of adverse effects. The results of new Phase III studies are awaited to confirm eravacycline's future applications in severe nosocomial infections.
