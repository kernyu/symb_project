OBJECTIVE: To determine the contamination condition of Salmonella in broiler breeding and slaughter processing in China and to investigate the distribution of antimicrobial resistance profiles. METHODS: Five large-scale broiler holdings and fourteen slaughterhouses were chosen to detect Salmonella in Henan, Jiangsu, Sichuan and Shandong provinces in 2010. A total of 835 anal swabs and 744 chicken carcasses were sampled to compare the difference of Salmonella contamination rate.Salmonella isolates were identified by serotyping according to Kauffmann-White scheme.The antimicrobial susceptibilities of Salmonella isolates were determined by broth microdilution method and sixteen antimicrobial agents were chosen and examined. RESULTS: In total, Salmonella isolates were recovered in 56 (6.7%) specimens among 835 collected anal swabs and 122 (16.4%) specimens among 744 broiler carcasses. Positive rate of Salmonella in broiler carcasses was higher than anal swabs (chi(2) = 36.94, P < 0.05). The dominant Salmonella serovars isolated from broiler anal swabs were S.enterica serovar Indiana and S.enterica serovar Enteritidis, accounting for 58.9% (33/56) and 32.1% (18/56) respectively. The prevalent serovars in broiler carcasses were also the two serovars and occupied 29.8% (37/124), 32.2% (40/124) respectively. Nearly 95.0% (171/180) Salmonella isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial, 78.3% (141/180) Salmonella strains were multi-drug resistant isolates and 20 (11.1%) Salmonella isolates were resistant to 14 antimicrobials. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that Salmonella contamination was common and serious in commercial broiler production and processing course in China. Salmonella contamination rate in broiler slaughter processing performance was higher than broiler flocks. Additionally, antibiotic resistance of Salmonella was in serious situation.
