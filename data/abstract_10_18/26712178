OBJECTIVE: To identify clinical and microbiological characteristics of Shigella infections among cancer patients. METHODS: The retrospective study was conducted at Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Lahore, Pakistan, and comprised medical records from December 2011 to November 2013 which were reviewed to identify persons with laboratory-confirmed Shigella infections. Demographic information, clinical history, seasonal variation, microbiological details, treatment given, and outcomes in term of symptoms resolution and mortality at two weeks were noted. RESULTS: Shigella infection was diagnosed in 45 cancer patients. The mean age of the patients was 36.02+/-19.30 years (range: 1-64 years), with 35(78%) patients being >18 years of age. Overall, 16(35.5%) patients had presented during winter months and 40(89%) presented as emergencies. Diarrhoea was present in 44(98%) patients and among them 20(45%) had dysentery whereas 28(64%) had fever and 21(47%) had abdominal pain. Of the total 45 cases, 41(91%) had isolates from stool. Besides, 39(87%) Shigella isolates were further speciated and Shigella flexneri was the most commonly isolated serotype in 25(64.1%). Overall, 42(93%) strains were sensitive to cefixime and ceftriaxone. Mean duration of symptoms resolution was 3.92+/-1.51 days (range: 1-10 days). No mortality was noted at 2 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Shigella flexneri was the most common serotype isolated. Majority of the isolates were sensitive to 3rd generation cephalosporins (cefixime/ceftriaxone).
