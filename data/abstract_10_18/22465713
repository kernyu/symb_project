Increasingly isolated frequency of antibiotic-resistant V. alginolyticus strains in clinic and aquaculture has been reported, but the mechanisms of V. alginolyticus antibiotic resistance are largely absent. In the present study, native/SDS-PAGE based proteomics, which may provide information on protein-protein interaction, was utilized to investigate differential proteins of V. alginolyticus in resistance to balofloxacin. Ten proteins were altered, in which V12G01_04671, V12G01_00457, V12G01_15927, V12G01_15240, NqrA (spot 26), and NqrF (spot 30) were downregulated, while V12G01_22043, TolC, V12G01_15130, V12G01_19297 were upregulated. Importantly, the two components of Na(+)-NQR complex, NqrA and NqrF, were vertically lined and was further investigated. Western blotting assay indicated that downregulation of the two proteins contrasted sharply with upregulation of a control protein TolC, which was consistent with the result obtained from 2-DE gel analysis. Furthermore, overexpression of NqrA, NqrF and TolC resulted in decrease and elevation of bacterial survival ability in medium with balofloxacin, respectively. These results indicate that downregulation of Na(+)-NQR complex is essential for V. alginolyticus resistance to balofloxacin. This is the first report on the role of Na(+)-NQR complex in antibiotic resistance. This finding highlights the way to an understanding of antibiotic-resistant mechanisms in content of metabolic regulation.
