Multi-drug resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) threatens the successful treatment of gonorrhea. This report presents preliminary findings with regard to the prevalence of laboratory-confirmed GC and the extent of drug-resistance among sample populations in five countries. Between October 2010 and January 2013, 1,694 subjects (54% male; 45% female; 1% unknown) were enrolled and screened for the presence of laboratory-confirmed GC in the United States, Djibouti, Ghana, Kenya, and Peru. Overall, 108 (6%) of enrolled subjects tested positive for GC. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing results were available for 66 GC isolates. Resistance to at least three antibiotics was observed at each overseas site. All isolates tested in Ghana (n=6) were resistant to ciprofloxacin, penicillin, and tetracycline. In Djibouti, preliminary results suggested resistance to penicillin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, cefepime, and ceftriaxone. The small sample size and missing data prevent comparative analysis and limit the generalizability of these preliminary findings.
