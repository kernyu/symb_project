Schwann cell injury is observed in diabetic neuropathy. It is speculated that glycolaldehyde (GA), a precursor of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), contributes to the pathogenesis and development of diabetic neuropathy. Here, we demonstrated for the first time that GA at near-physiological concentration decreased the viability of rat Schwann cells. In contrast, methylglyoxal, glyoxal, and 3-deoxyglucosone, all of which are AGE precursors, had no effects on cell viability. It is well known that methylglyoxal causes oxidative damage. In the present study, however, GA failed to induce reactive oxygen species production in Schwann cells. The addition of glutathione (GSH) or N-acetyl-L-cysteine protected Schwann cells from the loss of viability induced by GA. Moreover, GA increased intracellular GSH level and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase mRNA level. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that GA increased multidrug-resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) level as well. Moreover, we demonstrated that the knockdown of MRP1 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) enhanced the loss of cell viability induced by GA. Taken together, these findings suggest that MRP1, together with GSH, plays an important role in the GA-induced toxicity in Schwann cells.
