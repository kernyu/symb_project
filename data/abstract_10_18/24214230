This study attempted to determine whether cefuroxime was superior to cephalothin as a surrogate marker for cefpodoxime among urinary tract isolates. The MicroScan system (Siemens) was used to determine susceptibility for cephalothin and cefuroxime on consecutive cultures with a colony count of >/=50 000 organisms. Simultaneously, an Etest (bioMerieux) for cefpodoxime was conducted. The cefpodoxime interpretation was compared to that of the other two agents, and the categorical agreement was calculated, defined as the percentage of identical susceptibility interpretations. Cefuroxime (83 %) had a significantly higher categorical agreement than cephalothin (63 %) among 300 isolates (P<0.01). The major error rate was 16 % for cephalothin and 3 % for cefuroxime. The very major error rate was 7 % for cephalothin and 14 % for cefuroxime among the 14 cefpodoxime-resistant isolates. For Escherichia coli, the major error rates were 15 % and 1 % for cephalothin and cefuroxime, respectively. Very major error rates were 9 % for both agents. Cefuroxime was a better predictor of cefpodoxime susceptibility than cephalothin, and appears to be the preferred surrogate agent for the MicroScan system, particularly for E. coli.
