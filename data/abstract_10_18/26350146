Norspermidine is a potent and non-bactericidal small-molecule inhibitor of biofilm growth. In this study, impacts of norspermidine on biofilm control and existing biofilm dispersal by a mixed culture from wastewater treatment systems were investigated. A surface-mediated releasing approach for prevention of bacterial biofilm formation was established via encapsulating norspermidine into polyelectrolyte multilayer coatings. Results showed that the presence of norspermidine (500-1000 muM) in medium remarkably prevented biofilm formation. Norspermidine was also effective in disassembling pre-formed biofilms. Norspermidine-containing multilayer coatings were successfully fabricated on glass slides via layer-by-layer deposition in polyethylenimine (PEI) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) solution. This coating exhibited a high anti-biofilm property against a mixed culture and three pure strains (Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli). The loading amount and space distribution of norspermidine in the multilayer coating were key factors influencing its anti-biofilm efficacy. The polymer coating with norspermidine loaded in each bilayer (each-layer-type) exhibited better anti-biofilm efficacy than the bottom-type and the top-type coating, which showed a stable biofilm inhibition rate of about 60 % even after 5-day leaching in aqueous solution. Norspermidine could retard bacterial adhesion and destruct biofilm matrix by reducing exopolysaccharides and extracellular DNA (eDNA) associated with bacteria instead of growth inhibition. Norspermidine and the norspermidine-hosting coatings in this study offer a great potential for the control of biofilms in the settings of water purification and wastewater treatment systems, which shows the advantage of broad spectrum and less risk of evolved bacterial resistance compared to conventional microbicidal agents (e.g., antibiotics).
