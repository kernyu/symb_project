Important/potential value of macrolides has been proved in the management of chronic respiratory diseases by increasing basic and clinical trials.Through three face-to-face discussions, 10 experts examined important data and drafted this consensus related to macrolides: (1) mechanism of non-antiinfective effects; (2) clinical use in chronic respiratory diseases; (3) cautions of long-term use.The mechanism out of non-antiinfective effects includes anti-inflammatory effect, modifying airway secretion, immune-regulation related to antibacterial effect, corticoid saving effect and anti-viral effect.The efficacy of long-term use of low-dose macrolides is definitely confirmed in diffuse panbronchiolitis, chronic rhinosinusitis. It is considerably used in bronchiectasia, cystic fibrosis, severe asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Further studies should be conducted in cryptogenic organizing pneumonia and respiratory viral infection. It should be paid attention to its possible adverse effects (including drug interactions, cardiac toxicity, ototoxicity and disturbance of intestinal flora) and drug resistance in long-term use.A Chinese consensus for non-antiinfective effects and clinical use of macrolides is developed for the first time, which aims to expand their rational use and the further research.
