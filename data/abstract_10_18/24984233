The occurrence and distribution of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) and finished water are not well understood, and even less is known about the contribution of each treatment process to resistance gene reduction. The prevalence of ten commonly detected sulfonamide and tetracycline resistance genes, namely, sul I, sul II, tet(C), tet(G), tet(X), tet(A), tet(B), tet(O), tet(M) and tet(W) as well as 16S-rRNA genes, were surveyed in seven DWTPs in the Yangtze River Delta, China, with SYBR Green I-based real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. All of the investigated ARGs were detected in the source waters of the seven DWTPs, and sul I, sul II, tet(C) and tet(G) were the four most abundant ARGs. Total concentrations of ARGs belonging to either the sulfonamide or tetracycline resistance gene class were above 10(5) copies/mL. The effects of a treatment process on ARG removal varied depending on the overall treatment scheme of the DWTP. With combinations of the treatment procedures, however, the copy numbers of resistance genes were reduced effectively, but the proportions of ARGs to bacteria numbers increased in several cases. Among the treatment processes, the biological treatment tanks might serve as reservoirs of ARGs. ARGs were found in finished water of two plants, imposing a potential risk to human health. The results presented in this study not only provide information for the management of antibiotics and ARGs but also facilitate improvement of drinking water quality.
