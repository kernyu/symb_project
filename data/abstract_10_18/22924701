Several microbes have evolved clinically significant resistance against almost every available antibiotic. Yet the development of new classes of antibiotics has lagged far behind our growing need. Frequent and suboptimal use of antibiotics particularly in developing countries aggravated the problem by increasing the rate of resistance. Therefore, developing new and multidimensional strategies to combat microbial infections is warranted. These include i) modification of existing antibiotics, ii) searching new and novel antibiotics, iii) development and improvement of antibiotics carrier system to reduce amount and frequency of antibiotic doses, iv) development of targeted antibiotic delivery systems. Here, the authors discuss trends and development of nano-materials and alternative antimicrobials to solve the problem of antibiotic resistance.
