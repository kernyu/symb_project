Strains from various staphylococcal species produce bacteriocin peptides, which are thought to play important roles in bacterial competition and offer interesting biotechnological avenues. Many bacteriocins are secreted as inactive prepeptides with subsequent activation by specific proteolytic cleavage. By deletion of the protease gene gdmP in Staphylococcus gallinarum Tu3928, which produces the highly active lanthionine-containing bacteriocin gallidermin (lantibiotic), a strain was created producing inactive pregallidermin. On this basis, a new suicidal mutant selection system in the food-grade bacterium Staphylococcus carnosus was developed. Whereas pregallidermin was inactive against S. carnosus, it exerted potent bactericidal activity toward GdmP-secreting S. carnosus strains. To take advantage of this effect, gdmP was cloned in plasmid vectors used for random transposon mutagenesis or targeted allelic replacement of chromosomal genes. Both mutagenesis strategies rely on rare recombination events, and it has remained difficult and laborious to identify mutants among a vast majority of bacterial clones that still contain the delivery vectors. The gdmP-expressing plasmids pGS1 and pGS2 enabled very fast, easy, and reliable identification of transposon and gene replacement mutants, respectively. Mutant selection in the presence of pregallidermin caused suicidal inactivation of all clones that had retained the plasmids and allowed growth of only plasmid-cured mutants. Efficiency of mutant identification was several magnitudes higher than standard screening for the absence of plasmid-encoded antibiotic resistance markers and reached 100% specificity. Thus, the new pregallidermin-based mutant selection system represents a substantial improvement of staphylococcal mutagenesis methodology.
