BACKGROUND: Gonococcal infections are difficult to treat because of their multidrug antimicrobial resistance. The outbreak of antimicrobial-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae has begun in Asia and particularly in Japan. Therefore, it is very important that we understand the trend of antimicrobial resistance of N. gonorrhoeae in Asia including Japan. Our surveillance of the antimicrobial susceptibility of N. gonorrhoeae began in 2000 under the guidance of the Department of Urology, Gifu University. We report our surveillance data from 2000 to 2015. METHODS: We collected N. gonorrhoeae strains isolated from patients with gonococcal infections who visited our cooperating medical institutions in Japan from 2000 to 2015. MICs of penicillin G, cefixime, ceftriaxone, tetracycline, spectinomycin, azithromycin, and levofloxacin were determined by the agar dilution method approved by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. RESULTS: From 2000 to 2015, 2471 isolates of N. gonorrhoeae were collected in Japan. High rates of nonsusceptibility to penicillin, tetracycline, levofloxacin, cefixime, and azithromycin were shown. Around 5% to 10% of the strains isolated had a 0.25-mg/L MIC of ceftriaxone in each year, and 6 strains (0.24%) with a 0.5-mg/L MIC of ceftriaxone were isolated throughout the study period. Approximately 5% to 10% of the strains were resistant to each of ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and levofloxacin according to European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing breakpoints, and the rate has not increased significantly. CONCLUSIONS: From this study and previous pharmacodynamic analyses, a single 1-g dose of ceftriaxone is recommended to treat gonorrhea. As strains with high-level ceftriaxone resistance continue to spread, higher doses of ceftriaxone in monotherapy or multiple doses of ceftriaxone should be considered.
