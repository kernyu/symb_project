Spore-forming bacteria are a class of microorganisms that possess the ability to survive in extreme environmental conditions. Morphological features of spores assure their resistance to stress factors such as high temperature, radiation, disinfectants, and drying. Consequently, spore elimination in industrial and medical environments is very challenging. Ceragenins are a new class of cationic lipids characterized by a broad spectrum of bactericidal activity resulting from amphipathic nature and membrane-permeabilizing properties. To assess the impact of ceragenin CSA-13 on spores formed by Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 6051), we performed the series of experiments confirming that amphipathic and membrane-permeabilizing properties of CSA-13 are sufficient to disrupt the structure of B. subtilis spores resulting in decreased viability. Raman spectroscopy analysis provided evidence that upon CSA-13 treatment the number of CaDPA-positive spores was clearly diminished. As a consequence, a loss of impermeability of the inner membranes of spores, accompanied by a decrease in spore resistance and killing take place. In addition to their broad antimicrobial spectrum, ceragenins possess great potential for development as new sporicidal agents.
