To clarify molecular changes in beta-lactamase-nonproducing, ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) Haemophilus influenzae, which is increasing in pediatric patients with acute otitis media (AOM) in Japan, we identified amino acid (aa) substitutions in penicillin-binding protein 3 for the BLNAR strains. Of 191 H. influenzae strains isolated from middle ear fluid of pediatric AOM patients between October 2005 and March 2008, BLNAR strains determined by PCR accounted for 49.2%. Of the BLNAR strains, 91.5% possessed 4 aa substitutions: Met377Ile, Ser385Thr, Leu389Phe, and either Asn526Lys or Arg517His. Additionally, the emergence of BLNAR strains possessing a new aa substitution of Val329Ala in the conserved aa motif of Ser327-Thr-Val-Lys, or Val511Ala adjacent to the conserved aa motif of Lys512-Thr-Gly, was noted. Transformation of the ftsI gene into the Rd reference strain (ATCC 51907) demonstrated that these two aa substitutions reduced susceptibility to amoxicillin more than to cephalosporins. Pulsed-field gel electrophoretic profiles of BLNAR strains were highly diverse. These results suggested that inadequate antibiotic use may increase BLNAR strains by selecting mutations in the ftsI gene and that such use may have favored the new aa substitutions.
