5-Hydroxy-4-phenyl-butenolide (5H4PB) is a bioactive compound with antifungal and anti-obesity properties. Although it has recently been shown that 5H4PB activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma), the effect of 5H4PB on intracellular signaling pathways has not been clarified. In this study, we found that 5H4PB activated the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/antioxidant response element (ARE) signaling pathway, which plays an important role in cellular defense against oxidative stress, and the subsequent upregulation of ARE-dependent cytoprotective genes, including the heme oxygenase-1, catalase, and superoxide dismutase genes, without exhibiting cytotoxicity. In addition, 5H4PB significantly attenuated intracellular ROS generation, glutathione oxidation, and DNA damage induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) exposure in mouse fibroblast cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that pretreatment with 5H4PB confers a significant cytoprotective effect against H2O2-induced cell death in mouse cultured fibroblasts and primary hepatocytes. Thus, our study demonstrated that 5H4PB enhanced cellular resistance to oxidative damage via activation of the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway.
