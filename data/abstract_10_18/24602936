OBJECTIVE: To describe the implementation of a population-based surveillance system for multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli (MDR-GNB). DESIGN: Population-based active surveillance by the Georgia Emerging Infections Program. SETTING: Metropolitan Atlanta, starting November 2010. PATIENTS: Residents with MDR-GNB isolated from urine or a normally sterile site culture. METHODS: Surveillance was implemented in 3 phases: (1) surveying laboratory antibiotic susceptibility testing practices, (2) piloting surveillance to estimate the proportion of GNB that were MDR, and (3) maintaining ongoing active surveillance for carbapenem-nonsusceptible Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter baumannii using the 2010 Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) breakpoints. Pilot surveillance required developing and installing queries for GNB on the 3 types of automated testing instruments (ATIs), such as MicroScan, in Atlanta's clinical laboratories. Ongoing surveillance included establishing a process to extract data from ATIs consistently, review charts, manage data, and provide feedback to laboratories. RESULTS: Output from laboratory information systems typically used for surveillance would not reliably capture the CLSI breakpoints, but queries developed for the 3 ATIs did. In November 2010, 0.9% of Enterobacteriaceae isolates and 35.7% of A. baumannii isolates from 21 laboratories were carbapenem nonsusceptible. Over a 5-month period, 82 Enterobacteriaceae and 59 A. baumannii were identified as carbapenem nonsusceptible. CONCLUSIONS: Directly querying ATIs, a novel method of active surveillance for MDR-GNB, proved to be a reliable, sustainable, and accurate method that required moderate initial investment and modest maintenance. Ongoing surveillance is critical to assess the burden of and changes in MDR-GNB to inform prevention efforts.
