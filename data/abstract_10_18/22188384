The GTPases Arl1 and Ypt6 are involved in the intracellular transport of vesicles and their fusion with the trans-Golgi network. This work is focused on comparing the roles of these GTPases in the tolerance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells to an increased concentration of alkali metal cations and other stress factors. We studied the phenotypes of arl1 or ypt6 deletions in combination with the deletions of genes encoding alkali-metal-cation transporters (ena1-4, nha1, nhx1, and kha1). Salt sensitivity of the arl1 and ypt6 mutants was shown to be independent of the tested cation transporters and electrochemical membrane potential. Phenotype manifestations of ypt6 deletion were usually more prominent than those of arl1 (cells were more sensitive to KCl, NaCl, LiCl, hygromycin B, increased temperature, and increased pH). At suboptimal temperature, the growth inhibition of arl1 and ypt6 mutants was approximately the same, and low pH was the only condition where arl1 mutants grew even worse than ypt6 mutants. Overexpression of the ARL1 gene suppressed the phenotypes of ypt6 deletion; however, this did not work vice versa (additional copies of YPT6 could not replace ARL1). Our results suggest partially overlapping functions of the GTPases in resistance to various stress factors, with Ypt6 being more efficient under physiological conditions and Arl1 more versatile when overexpressed.
