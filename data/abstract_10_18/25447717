OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to describe the microbiological characteristics of an extensively drug-resistant (XDR) isolate of Morganella morganii obtained from a patient with sepsis of urinary origin and to describe the patient's clinical characteristics. We further aimed to perform a literature review of the situation in Latin America regarding Gram-negative bacillus (GNB) carriers of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM-1) and qnr genes and current reports on the treatment of infections caused by XDR enterobacteria, with particular attention to colistin-resistant isolates. METHODS: The patient's clinical data were obtained from his medical history. Microbiological identification and susceptibility testing were done using the VITEK 2 Compact System. Resistance genes were detected by PCR and sequencing. RESULTS: Blood and urine cultures grew an M. morganii isolate (Mm4232) harboring NDM-1 and qnrD1. The patient was treated successfully with fosfomycin and double doses of meropenem. There are no previous reports of the use of fosfomycin and meropenem to treat infections by XDR enterobacteria harboring NDM-1 carbapenemase. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of qnrD1 in South America. We consider that this report could be helpful to physicians implementing treatments for infections caused by XDR GNB, including colistin-carbapenem-resistant GNB.
