PURPOSE: Therapeutic efficacy and safety in infections due to multidrug-resistant bacteria can be improved by the clinical development of new compounds and devising new derivatives of already useful antibiotics. Due to a striking global increase in multidrug-resistant Gram-positive but even more Gram-negative organisms, new antibiotics are urgently needed. METHODS: This paper provides a review of novel antibiotic compounds which are already in clinical development, mainly in phase III clinical trials. CONCLUSION: Each of these new trials increases the possibility of new antibiotics receiving approval.
