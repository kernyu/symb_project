Brucellosis is an important public health problem in Peru. We evaluated 48 human Brucella melitensis biotype 1 strains from Peru between 2000 and 2006. MICs of isolates to doxycycline, azithromycin, gentamicin, rifampin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were determined by the Etest method. All isolates were sensitive to tested drugs during the periods of testing. Relapses did not appear to be related to drug resistance.
