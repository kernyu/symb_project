BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The global spread of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) constitutes one of the most serious contemporary challenges to the treatment of hospital-acquired infections. We aimed to screen and assess the antibiotic susceptibility pattern of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from clinical specimens in local hospitals of Northern province in Jordan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Staphylococcus aureus was isolated and identified using standard methods from various clinical specimens of different infected body sites from 358 patients during the period from January 2008 to November 2012. RESULTS: Our analysis showed that 31.6% of S. aureus infections were MRSA, while 31% were multidrug resistance (MDR) and 42.7% were Oxacillin-resistant (ORSA). Most of these strains were isolated from wound specimens. All isolates were susceptible to vancomycin (100%). They were also susceptible to chloramphenicol, linezolid, nitrofurantoin, rifampicin and teicoplanin (>80%), but showed resistance to erythromycin and penicillin. CONCLUSION: Vancomycin was the most effective antimicrobial agent against S. aureus. We recommend regular surveillance of hospital associated infections and monitoring antibiotic sensitivity pattern and strict drug policy for antibiotics used within and outside the hospital environments.
