The ever-increasing proportion of elderly people in the general population represents physicians and pharmacists with new challenges. Older people suffer more frequently than younger persons from bacterial diseases, and they have a higher tendency to develop more severe or progressive forms of these illnesses. Bacterial diseases of the urinary tract, respiratory tract, skin and soft tissues are especially common in old age. In general, most antibacterial agents are also promising agents for the therapy of bacterial diseases in the elderly. Prior to initiating therapy, however, the modified organ functions of the elderly have to be considered carefully. Depending on the individual and the antibacterial agent, a dose adjustment may be necessary. To reduce the high mortality rate characteristic for many infectious diseases in the elderly, antibacterial therapy ought to be carefully calculated and initiated as quickly as possible. It has to be born in mind that some side effects of antibiotics are more common and more severe in old age. Since older people often take several drugs simultaneously, the probability for the occurrence of side effects and drug interactions in this population is greatly increased. Significant compliance problems may also arise.
