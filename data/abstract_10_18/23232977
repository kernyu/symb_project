This study compared Neo-Sensitabs with Oxoid paper disks using the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) disk diffusion antimicrobial susceptibility test on Mueller-Hinton agar. The EUCAST-recommended quality control strains (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212) (Part I) and clinical isolates (Part II) were investigated. In Part I of the study, 27 combinations of antimicrobial agents were tested on four quality control strains repeatedly up to 60 times and zone diameters of tablets and disks were compared. In Part II of the study, 351 clinical isolates were included to cover a broad range of species, as well as resistance mechanisms. In Part I, four major deviations (>1 mm outside quality control ranges) were observed with Neo-Sensitabs. In one case with P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (meropenem), there was a corresponding major deviation (2 mm) with the Oxoid disk. The three remaining major deviations with Neo-Sensitabs were observed with meropenem (2 mm) in E. coli ATCC 25922 and with ciprofloxacin (2 mm) and gentamicin (3 mm) in P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853. For Oxoid disks, there were only minor deviations (=1 mm outside quality control ranges) in these three cases. In Part II, there were six discrepancies, susceptible versus resistant, in 3,533 comparisons between the two methods with the clinical isolates. The Rosco Neo-Sensitabs appear to be a possible alternative to Oxoid paper disks for EUCAST disk diffusion antimicrobial susceptibility testing on Mueller-Hinton agar.
