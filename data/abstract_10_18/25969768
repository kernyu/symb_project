This work aims at characterizing endoscope biofilm-isolated (PAI) and reference strain P. aeruginosa (PA) adhesion, biofilm formation and sensitivity to antibiotics. The recovery ability of the biofilm-growing bacteria subjected to intermittent antibiotic pressure (ciprofloxacin (CIP) and gentamicin (GM)), as well as the development of resistance towards antibiotics and benzalkonium chloride (BC), were also determined. The capacity of both strains to develop biofilms was greatly impaired in the presence of CIP and GM. Sanitization was not complete allowing biofilm recovery after the intermittent cycles of antibiotic pressure. The environmental pressure exerted by CIP and GM did not develop P. aeruginosa resistance to antibiotics nor cross-resistance towards BC. However, data highlighted that none of the antimicrobials led to complete biofilm eradication, allowing the recovery of the remaining adhered population possibly due to the selection of persister cells. This feature may lead to biofilm recalcitrance, reinforcement of bacterial attachment, and recolonization of other sites.
