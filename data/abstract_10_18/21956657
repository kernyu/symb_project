Typhoid fever, which is caused by Salmonella typhi and paratyphi, is a severe systemic disease that remains a major public health issue in several areas of the world. We can model the human disease using mice infected with a related bacterium, Salmonella typhimurium. This model recapitulates several clinical aspects of the human disease and allows for the study of the host response to Salmonella typhimurium infection in vivo. Previous work in our laboratory has identified three Immunity to typhimurium loci (Ity, Ity2 and Ity3) in the wild-derived MOLF/Ei mice, influencing survival after infection with Salmonella typhimurium. The MOLF/Ei alleles at Ity and Ity2 are protective, while the MOLF/Ei allele at Ity3 confers susceptibility. In this paper, we have generated a novel cross combination between the highly susceptible strain, MOLF/Ei, and the resistant strain, 129S6, to better define the genetic architecture of susceptibility to infection in MOLF/Ei. Using this cross, we have replicated the locus on chr 11 (Ity2) and identified a novel locus on chr 13 (Ity13). Using microarrays and transcriptional profiling, we examined the response of uninfected and infected Ity2 congenic mice. These analyses demonstrate a role for both type-1-interferon (IFN) and TRP53 signaling in the pathogenesis of Salmonella infection.
