INTRODUCTION: Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) is considered as a major pathogen of nosocomial infections among immunosuppressed patients. AIM: The aim of this study was to identify the types of Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome mec (SCCmec) and Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL) gene among clinical Methicillin-Resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE) isolates collected from Isfahan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed from March 2014 to January 2015 at a tertiary care hospital of Isfahan, Iran. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests of S. epidermidis isolates were performed by the disc diffusion method. All the strains were screened for methicillin resistance based on resistance to cefoxitin (30 mug) disc and presence of mecA gene. Determination of SCCmec typing and PVL toxin gene were performed by PCR method. For categorical variables different groups were compared using the Chi-square test or Fisher exact test. A p-value of <0.05 was considered significant for all statistical tests. RESULTS: The frequency of MRSE was 53.8% according to the presence of mecA gene. The overall resistance rate was high with ciprofloxacin (81.4%). PCR analysis showed that 17% (12/70) of MRSE isolate carried the PVL gene and 43% (30/70) were SCCmec type I; 11.4% (8/70) were type II; and 34.2% (24/70) were type IV, whereas, 11.4% (8/70) of the MRSE isolates could not be typed. CONCLUSION: SCCmec type I was the major type of SCCmec, which indicates an emergence of this SCCmec type in the studied medical centers. Increased prevalence of SCCmec types in community is cause of an increase in antibiotic resistance among microorganisms.
