METHODS: Twenty-seven clinical isolates of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae with MICs >/=4 mg/L for imipenem or meropenem were obtained from inpatients in a hospital in Vietnam. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests and whole genome sequencing were performed. Multilocus sequence typing and the presence of drug resistant genes were determined and a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed by SNP alignment of whole genome sequencing data. RESULTS: All the isolates harbored one of genes encoding carbapenemases, including KPC-2, NDM-1, NDM-4 and OXA-48. Of the isolates, 13 were resistant to arbekacin with MICs >/=256 mg/L and to amikacin with MICs >/=512 mg/L. These isolates harbored a gene encoding a 16S rRNA methylase, either RmtB or RmtC. Eighteen and 4 isolates belonged to international clones, ST15 and ST16, respectively. None of the isolates had colistin-resistant factors. CONCLUSION: Carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates belonged to international clones spread in a medical setting in Vietnam, and that these isolates harbored genes encoding various combinations of carbapenemases and 16S rRNA methylases. This is the first report of KPC-2, NDM-4 and OXA-48 producers in a medical setting in Vietnam.
