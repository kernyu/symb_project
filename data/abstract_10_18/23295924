We report the nucleotide sequence of a novel bla(KPC-2)-harboring IncFII(K1) plasmid, pBK32179, isolated from a carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae ST258 strain from a New York City patient. pBK32179 is 165 kb long, consists of a large backbone of pKPN3-like plasmid, and carries an 18.5-kb bla(KPC-2)-containing element that is highly similar to plasmid pKpQIL. pBK32179-like plasmids were identified in 8.3% of strains in a collection of 96 K. pneumoniae isolates from hospitals in the New York City area.
