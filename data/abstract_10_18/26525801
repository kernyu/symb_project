Resistance to isoniazid (INH) is the most common form of drug resistance in pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Although fluoroquinolones (FQs) are recommended to strengthen treatment regimens for INH-resistant pulmonary TB, few studies have evaluated the clinical efficacy of FQ-containing regimens in patients with INH-resistant pulmonary TB. A retrospective cohort study of 140 patients with INH-resistant pulmonary TB was performed between 2005 and 2012. We evaluated whether FQ-containing regimens yielded improved treatment outcomes for patients with INH-resistant pulmonary TB. Overall, favorable outcomes were achieved in 128 (91.4%) patients. Unfavorable outcomes occurred in 12 patients (8.6%), including 7 with treatment failure (5.0%) and 5 with relapse after initial treatment completion (3.6%). FQs, such as levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, were given to 75 (53.6%) patients. Favorable treatment outcomes were more frequent for patients who received FQs (97.3% [73/75 patients]) than for those who did not receive FQs (84.6% [55/65 patients]) (P = 0.007). Patients who did not receive FQs were more likely to develop treatment failure (9.2% [6/65 patients] versus 1.3% [1/75 patients]) (P = 0.049) than patients who received FQs. The adjusted proportion of unfavorable outcomes was significantly higher among patients who did not receive FQs (8.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.3 to 21.5%) than among those who did receive FQs (1.5%; 95% CI, 0.3 to 7.7%) (P = 0.037). These results suggest that the addition of FQs can improve treatment outcomes for patients with INH-resistant pulmonary TB.
