The infection of a wound is one of the major contributors to delays in healing and tissue regeneration. As multi-drug resistance to antibiotics is becoming a serious threat, research in this field has focused on finding new agents and strategies to fight infection and additionally to reduce healing times. The topical use of autologous Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) as a biological accelerator of the healing process, has been safely used as a form of treatment for wounds since the 1990s. Although the presence or absence of leucocytes in PRP preparation was previously neglected, in the last decade more attention has been paid to their role and several studies have been conducted to explore both their immuno-metabolic effects and their antimicrobial properties. In this review, we aim to summarise the literature on the contribution of leucocytes included in PRP preparations in terms of their antimicrobial properties. This should help to inform clinical practice and additional research in this promising field.
