The human tyrosinase gene TYR is a multifunctional reporter gene with potential use in photoacoustic imaging (PAI), positron emission tomography (PET), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We sought to establish and evaluate a reporter gene system using TYR under the control of the Tet-on gene expression system (gene expression induced by doxycycline [Dox]) as a multimodality imaging agent. We transfected TYR into human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231), naming the resulting cell line 231-TYR. Using non-transfected MDA-MB-231 cells as a control, we verified successful expression of TYR by 231-TYR after incubation with Dox using western blot, cellular tyrosinase activity, Masson-Fontana silver staining, and a cell immunofluorescence study, while the control cells and 231-TYR cells without Dox exposure revealed no TYR expression. Detected by its absorbance at 405 nm, increasing concentrations of melanin correlated positively with Dox concentration and incubation time. TYR expression by Dox-induced transfected cells shortened MRI T1 and T2 relaxation times. Photoacoustic signals were easily detected in these cells. (18)F-5-fluoro-N-(2-[diethylamino]ethyl)picolinamide ((18)F-5-FPN), which targets melanin, quickly accumulated in Dox-induced 231-TYR cells. These show that TYR induction of melanin production is regulated by the Tet-on system, and TYR-containing indicator cells may have utility in multimodality imaging.
