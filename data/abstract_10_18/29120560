We present an isolate of Klebsiella pneumoniae OXA-48 isolated in a 68-year-old man who underwent radical prostatectomy due to prostate cancer. The antibiotic susceptibility testing to a wide range of antibiotics was performed by disk diffusion method and determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations. The isolate was classified as multidrug-resistant. It showed intermediate susceptibility to imipenem and meropenem, resistance to ertapenem, and sensitivity only to colistin, amikacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The isolate was positive for ESBLs, negative for AmpC. Polymerase chain reaction and sequencing revealed bla(OXA-48)', bla(CTX-M-15) and bla(SHV-11). The plasmid encoding OXA-48 ss-lactamase did not belong to any known PCR-based replicon typing. According to genotyping, the isolate belonged to ST37.
