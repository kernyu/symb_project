Carbapenems are considered last-resort antibiotics in health care. Increasing reports of carbapenemase-producing bacteria in food-producing animals and in the environment indicate the importance of this phenomenon in public health. Surveillance for carbapenemase genes and carbapenemase-producing bacteria in Dutch food-producing animals, environmental freshwater, and imported ornamental fish revealed several chromosome-based blaOXA-48-like variants in Shewanella spp., including two new alleles, blaOXA-514 and blaOXA-515 Carbapenemase genes were not associated with mobile genetic elements or Enterobacteriaceae.
