We show here that matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) accurately and quickly identified the five high-risk clones of Pseudomonas aeruginosa sequence type 111 (ST111), ST175, ST235, ST253, and ST395. The use of this screening technique by clinical microbiology laboratories may tackle the spread of high-risk clones by the quick implementation of hygiene control procedures for relevant patients.
