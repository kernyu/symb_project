A cDNA library from tobacco inoculated with Rhizoctonia solani was constructed, and several cDNA fragments were identified by differential hybridization screening. One cDNA clone that was dramatically repressed, NtKTI1, was confirmed as a member of the Kunitz plant proteinase inhibitor family. RT-PCR analysis revealed that NtKTI1 was constitutively expressed throughout the whole plant and preferentially expressed in the roots and stems. Furthermore, RT-PCR analysis showed that NtKTI1 expression was repressed after R. solani inoculation, mechanical wounding and salicylic acid treatment, but was unaffected by methyl jasmonate, abscisic acid and NaCl treatment. In vitro assays showed that NtKTI1 exerted prominent antifungal activity towards R. solani and moderate antifungal activity against Rhizopus nigricans and Phytophthora parasitica var. nicotianae. Bioassays of transgenic tobacco demonstrated that overexpression of NtKTI1 enhanced significantly the resistance of tobacco against R. solani, and the antisense lines exhibited higher susceptibility than control lines towards the phytopathogen. Taken together, these studies suggest that NtKTI1 may be a functional Kunitz trypsin inhibitor with antifungal activity against several important phytopathogens in the tobacco defense response.
