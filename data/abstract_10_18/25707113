A key factor of immunity, salicylic acid (exogenous or accumulating under the action of biotrophic or semibiotrophic pathogens on plants), causes the formation of not only protective antipathogenic proteins but also many proteins, which enhance the resistance of host plant cells. Salicylate-induced proteins, which are encoded by nuclear genes and formed with cytoplasmic ribosomes, function in the cytosol or are transported into nuclei, vacuoles, plastids, mitochondria, and outside the plasmalemma. This review is focused on salicylate-induced proteins, which are not only delivered into different compartments but are also involved in their transmembrane transport.
