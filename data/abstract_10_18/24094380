Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) consist mainly of Enterococcus faecalis and E faecium, the latter mostly hospital-acquired. In addition, E gallinarum and E casseliflavus are intrinsically vancomycin-resistant and are community-acquired. VRE have become common in many hospitals throughout the world and, once established, are very difficult to eradicate. VRE are difficult to treat; therefore, infection control measures in hospitals are of prime importance in preventing the establishment of these pathogens. Most severe VRE infections will need combination therapy because many of the effective antimicrobial agents, when used alone, have only a bacteriostatic effect.
