Cardiac fibroblasts are resistant to several pro-apoptotic factors that prevail in the diseased myocardium. Resistance to death signals may, in the short-term, enable these cells to play a central role in tissue repair following myocyte loss but, in the long-term, facilitate their persistence in the infarct scar, resulting in disproportionate stromal growth and pump dysfunction. Surprisingly, the molecular basis of apoptosis resistance in cardiac fibroblasts remains unclear. We explored the recruitment of anti-apoptotic mechanisms in cardiac fibroblasts subjected to oxidative stress, a major component of ischemia-reperfusion injury and heart failure. Cardiac fibroblasts exposed to H2O2 expressed enhanced levels of anti-apoptotic cIAP-2 mRNA and protein, revealed by real time PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. Pulmonary fibroblasts did not express cIAP-2 and were more susceptible than cardiac fibroblasts to H2O2. cIAP-2 knockdown by RNA interference promoted apoptosis in H2O2-treated cardiac fibroblasts. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed NF-kappaB activation in cells under oxidative stress. NF-kappaB inhibition in H2O2-treated cells resulted in significant attenuation of cIAP-2 mRNA and protein expression and apoptosis, indicating involvement of NF-kappaB in cell survival via regulation of cIAP-2. Further, pCMV promoter-driven constitutive expression of cIAP-2 reduced viability loss in NF-kappaB-inhibited cardiac fibroblasts exposed to oxidative stress. H2O2 also caused ERK1/2 activation, which, upon inhibition, prevented IkappaBalpha degradation and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. Moreover, ERK1/2 inhibition attenuated H2O2-induced cIAP-2 expression and compromised viability in H2O2-treated cardiac fibroblasts. We propose for the first time that ERK1/2-dependent activation of NF-kappaB and consequent induction of cIAP-2 protects cardiac fibroblasts from oxidative damage.
