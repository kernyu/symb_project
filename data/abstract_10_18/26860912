The goal of this study was to identify host and viral factors affecting the response to pegylated interferon/ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV) treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1b. Baseline characteristics of the patients and sequences within the p7 region were analyzed in pre-treatment serum samples from 53 individuals with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1b and related to the outcome of therapy. We found a significant correlation between age and response to therapy (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the pre-treatment viral load was closely associated with the stage of liver fibrosis (p < 0.001). The presence of fewer than 4 mutations and age above 40 were significantly associated with non-response (NR) (p < 0.001). Our findings may be useful for estimating the likelihood of achieving a sustained virologic response (SVR) in patients who are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus genotype 1b.
