Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, causal agent of anthracnose in the common bean, has wide genetic variability. Differential bean cultivars and morphological and physiological characteristics were used to analyze 74 isolates of C. lindemuthianum collected in two counties in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Six different races were found, with a predominance of race 65 at both locations. Isolates were classified according to their sensitivities to the fungicide thiophanate-methyl, normally used in the control of common bean anthracnose. In all, approximately 10% of isolates were resistant to the fungicide in vitro. Characteristics such as indexes of mycelia growth rate, colony diameter, sporulation capacity, and percentage of germination demonstrated the high genetic variability of C. lindemuthianum. We also observed variation in conidial cytology. The conidia of most isolates showed septa formation after germination, in contrast to septa absence, previously reported in the literature. Sexual and asexual reproduction were evaluated for mechanisms that may contribute in the generation of variability in C. lindemuthianum. Conidial anastomosis tubes were commonly found, indicating that asexual reproduction can help increase variability in this species. Information from this study confirmed high variability in C. lindemuthianum and will guide future studies in basic knowledge and applied technologies.
