The BSAC Standing Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing is one of several European national breakpoint committees that agreed in 2002 to harmonize clinical MIC breakpoints. The process of harmonization has since been completed for commonly used agents, and breakpoints for new agents have been set by EUCAST in accordance with a procedure defined by the EMA. EUCAST breakpoints have now been adopted by a large majority of laboratories in Europe. BSAC implemented the EUCAST breakpoints in its own disc diffusion susceptibility testing method as harmonized breakpoints were agreed to over the years. Since the development of the EUCAST disc diffusion method, several countries with their own disc diffusion methods have switched to the EUCAST method, and BSAC will replace support of its own disc diffusion method with support for the EUCAST method from January 2016. The EUCAST breakpoints are also available in automated systems. The harmonized breakpoints and methods will help to avoid different reports of susceptibility for the same isolate in different countries and enable more reliable comparison of resistance rates in surveillance studies in different countries.
