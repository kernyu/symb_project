This study assessed the temporal changes in the molecular epidemiology of bacteremic Escherichia coli isolates producing CTX-M-14 in Hong Kong. Blood isolates from 1996 to 1998 (period 1, n = 50) and 2007 to 2008 (period 2, n = 117) were investigated by molecular methods. CTX-M-type ESBL was carried by 98.2% (164/167) of the isolates. In both periods, the CTX-M-9 group and CTX-M-14 allele were the predominant ESBL type. The major clones were found to change from ST68 and ST405 in period 1 to ST131, ST69, and ST12 in period 2. Among 65 CTX-M-14-producing plasmids investigated further, 54 had the FII replicon. Replicon sequence typing and plasmid polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism showed that 79.6% (43/54) of the FII plasmid subset was similar to the completely sequenced plasmid, pHK01 (human urine, Hong Kong, 2004). These pHK01-like plasmids were found to have spread to the major clones (ST68, ST405, and ST131) and multiple singleton isolates of all 4 phylogenetic groups.
