Efavirenz is an antiretroviral drug used in the treatment of HIV-positive patients. A simple, fast and sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was developed in order to determine efavirenz in three types of samples provided from pharmacokinetic studies. The analysis took 5min and was performed using a C18 analytical column (Discovery HS C18, 150x4.6mm, particle size of 5mum) in isocratic mode with a mobile phase containing acetonitrile and water (65:35, v/v), a flow rate of 1.6mLmin(-1), a sample volume of 10muL and UV detection at 245nm. Three different sample matrices (Opti-MEM medium, Krebs perfusion liquid and tissue lysate) and their treatment (dilution, SPE) were considered. The validated method was applied for the analysis of 805 real samples arising from in vitro transcellular transport assays and in vivo organ perfusion experiments in order to evaluate the interaction of efavirenz with ATP-dependent drug efflux transporters. The lack of interaction of efavirenz with ABCB1, ABCG2 and ABCC2 transporters as well as technical aspects of this analysis, including the adhesion of efavirenz to the plastic materials and the stability of the drug during different tissue lysis approaches are discussed.
