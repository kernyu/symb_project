A comparison of a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometric (MALDI-TOF MS) meropenem hydrolysis assay with the Carba NP test showed that both methods exhibited low sensitivity (approximately 76%), mainly due to the false-negative results obtained with OXA-48-type producers. The addition of NH4HCO3 to the reaction buffer for the MALDI-TOF MS assay dramatically improved its sensitivity (98%). Automatic interpretation of the MALDI-TOF MS assay, using the MBT STAR-BL software, generally agreed with the results obtained after manual analysis. For the Carba NP test, spectrophotometric analysis found six additional carbapenemase producers.
