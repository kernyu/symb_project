INTRODUCTION: Miconazole (MCZ) is a time-honored antifungal of the imidazole class. MCZ exerts a multipronged effect on fungi. It inhibits the cytochrome P450 complex, including the 14alpha-demethylase enzyme required for ergosterol biosynthesis, in fungal cell membranes. In addition, intracellular accumulation of toxic methylated sterols occurs and the synthesis of triglycerides and phospholipids is altered. Disturbances in oxidative and peroxidative enzyme activities lead to an intracellular toxic concentration of hydrogen peroxide. As a result, intracellular organelle destruction then leads to cell necrosis. Farnesol synthesis stimulated in Candida spp. prevents the yeast-to-mycelium formation. MCZ is further active against Gram-positive bacteria. AREAS COVERED: This review aims at revisiting the MCZ antifungal activity in dermatomycoses. EXPERT OPINION: MCZ's wide spectrum of activity appears noteworthy. The full pharmacological profile of MCZ indicates its fungistatic profile through its effect on ergosterol biosynthesis. In addition, it exhibits a fungicidal effect against a number of fungal species, due to hydrogen peroxide accumulation. MCZ is characterized by high safety, efficacy and versatility, and a unique, multifaceted nature of activity in the treatment of dermatomycoses.
