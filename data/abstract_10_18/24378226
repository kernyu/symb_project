A clinical Providencia stuartii isolate SM662 was recovered from a patient hospitalized in the intensive care unit at the Military hospital, Tunisia. This isolate was resistant to penicillins, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones. A marked in vitro synergy between ceftazidime or cefotaxime and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid on Mueller-Hinton agar plates suggested the presence of an extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase. In addition, an unusual synergy was found between cefepime or aztreonam, and cefoxitin or imipenem on a double disk synergy test suggesting a VEB-type extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase. The characterization of beta-lactamases and associated resistance genes was performed by isoelectric focusing, polymerase chain reaction and nucleotide sequencing. Two beta-lactamases bands with pI values of 5.4 and 7.7, which were matched to TEM-1, VEB-1-a and OXA-2-like beta-lactamases were detected. The blaVEB-1-a gene was found to be associated with complex genetic structures, including Re elements. These beta-lactamases were not transferred by electroporation or conjugation experiments to the transconjugants and electroporants. Hybridization methods showed that the extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase encoding gene may have a chromosomal localization. The isolate SM662 produced the quinolone resistance determinants qnrA6 and aac(6')-Ib-cr which were successfully transferred. The detection of an associated chromosomal quinolone resistance revealed the presence of a gyrA mutation at codon 83 (Ser83Ile). This is the first report of the linkage VEB-1-a/OXA-2-like in P. stuartii associated with the description of qnrA6 and aac(6')-Ib-cr genes in this isolate.
