BACKGROUND: Patients admitted to critical care units can be infected with a large number of fungal isolates that are occasionally responsible for invasive fungal infections (IFI). AIMS: To describe the epidemiological profile and antifungal susceptibility patterns of fungal isolates in our unit, and to identify key risk factors associated with the development of IFI. METHODS: A descriptive cohort and retrospective study with patients admitted to a polyvalent Critical Care Unit of a university hospital was carried out. The isolation of at least one fungal species in a culture of biological samples, over a period of 48 months was considered. RESULTS: Twenty patients out of 232 developed IFI. Patients in the IFI group had a higher mortality and higher Candida score value 48 h prior to clinical diagnosis. Risk factors associated with the development of IFI were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, gastrointestinal surgery, total parenteral nutrition, and prolonged systemic corticosteroid therapy. The predominant fungal species in both groups was Candida albicans, with global resistance to fluconazole and itraconazole of 1.94%. CONCLUSIONS: We found a low incidence of species of Candida non-C. albicans in our unit. The rate of resistance to azoles in C. albicans was similar to that of larger series. Gastrointestinal surgery, COPD, prolonged treatment with corticosteroids, and parenteral nutrition administration are risk factors associated with the development of IFI.
