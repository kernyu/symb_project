We isolated Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O157:H7 strains resistant to third-generation cephalosporins. The resistant strains harbored blaCMY-2, a plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase. Genotyping of isolates revealed the possible spread of this problematic bacterium. Results suggested the importance of the investigation and surveillance of enterobacteria with plasmids harboring blaCMY-2.
