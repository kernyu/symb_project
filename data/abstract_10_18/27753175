Interferons have attracted considerable attention due to their vital roles in the host immune response and low induction of antibiotic resistance. In this study, total RNA was extracted from spleen cells of chicken embryos inoculated with Newcastle disease vaccine, and the full-length chicken interferon-gamma (ChIFN-gamma) gene was amplified by RT-PCR. The full complementary DNA sequence of the ChIFN-gamma gene was 495 bp long and was cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pProEXHTb . The plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli DH5alpha and the expression of ChIFN-gamma was induced by isopropyl beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside. Sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot results showed the expressed fusion protein had a molecular weight of approximately 18 kDa and was recognized by an anti-His mAb. Moreover, ChIFN-gamma was found to demonstrate anti-viral activity in vitro. To test the in vivo function of ChIFN-gamma in broilers under heat stress, a total of 100 broilers were randomly assigned to either a control group or a treated group, in which they were hypodermically injected with recombinant ChIFN-gamma. Results demonstrated ChIFN-gamma affects the messenger RNA expression levels of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in the heart and lung tissues, and decreases the concentration of HSP70 in serum. Therefore, we conclude recombinant ChIFN-gamma can reduce heat stress to some extent in vivo.
