Cytomegalovirus (CMV) remains a leading cause of morbidity after solid organ transplantation. The efficiency of antivirals for the treatment of CMV infections may be hampered because of the emergence of CMV resistance to antivirals. The development of CMV multidrug resistance, which remains uncommon but does occur, constitutes a clinically challenging complication and may contribute to difficult therapeutic management and adverse clinical outcome. We report here the observation of the emergence of a multidrug-resistant CMV infection in a heart-transplant recipient and review the literature on similar cases to identify the potential strategies for the successful management of CMV multidrug resistance among immunocompromised patients.
