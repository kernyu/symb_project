<p>Surgical procedures are an important piece of a dermatologist's daily practice. Therefore, the optimization of post-surgical wound healing is an area of utmost importance and interest. Although low risk, one notable barrier to proper wound healing is surgical site infection.</p> <p>In an attempt to mitigate this risk and improve surgical outcomes, multiple topical products continue to be used both pre- and postprocedure. Traditionally, this includes both topical antibiotics and antiseptics. However, these products are not without consequence.</p> <p>The overuse of topical antibiotics as prophylaxis for infection has contributed to increased bacterial resistance, and in fact is no longer recommended by the American Academy of Dermatology in clean post surgical wounds. Topical antiseptics, including chlorhexidine and povidone-iodine, can have a cytotoxic effect on keratinocytes and may actually impede wound healing as a result. In addition, chlorhexidine in particular can produce both otologic and ocular toxic effects when used on the face. Emerging products, such as hypochlorous acid, may be a potential alternative to the more commonly used agents, as it has effective antimicrobial actions and minimal adverse effects. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to highlight several topical products used to optimize post-surgical wound healing and discuss both their efficacy and safety.</p> <p><em>J Drugs Dermatol. 2017;16(3):209-212.</em></p>.
