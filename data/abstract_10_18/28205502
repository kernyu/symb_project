In 2014, a total of 2,976 Enterobacteriaceae isolates with decreased susceptibility to carbapenems were received at the French Associated National Reference Center for Antibiotic Resistance (NRC) and were characterised for their molecular resistance mechanism to carbapenems and compared with results obtained during 2012 and 2013.The overall number of enterobacterial isolates with decreased susceptibility to carbapenems received at the NRC rapidly increased (more than twofold in two years) with a growing proportion of carbapenemase producers (23.1% in 2012 vs 28.6% in 2013 vs 36.2% in 2014). Between 2012 and 2014, the main carbapenemase type was OXA-48, with an increase in OXA-48 variants (mostly OXA-181) and NDM producers, whereas the number KPC producers decreased. We identified a potential spread of OXA-181 producers in the tropical region of Africa. Finally, OXA-48 and OXA-48-related enzymes remained the predominant carbapenemases in France. The number of carbapenemase-producing Escherischia coli isolates was multiplied by fivefold between 2012 and 2014, suggesting a possible dissemination in the community.
