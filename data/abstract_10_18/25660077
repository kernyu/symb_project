Infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) are increasing on a global scale. Because of the need for CRE transmission prevention and control, we sought to evaluate the efficacy of a silver-based skin antiseptic against these organisms. Using a human skin analog, a third party laboratory conducted efficacy testing. The results suggest that this product provides antimicrobial activity against CRE on human skin. Because of the unique properties, this antiseptic may be useful for daily bathing of hospitalized patients to assist in the control of CRE.
