Multiresistant bacteria play an increasingly important role in everyday clinical practice. This is particularly the case in intensive care units and wards with critically ill patients. Often there is insufficient knowledge concerning diagnostic screening indications and strategies to avoid cross-transmission via infection control strategies. Hereby, we provide an orienting overview and assessment about current guidelines and recommendations with special focus on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multiresistantgramnegative bacteria (MRGN).
