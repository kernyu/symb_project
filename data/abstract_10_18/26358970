The epidemiology of multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDRB) has changed significantly in European healthcare settings, with a decrease in frequency of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and an increase in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Little is known about the effects of these changes on ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). A retrospective 5-year trend analysis of ICU antibiotic consumption and resistance in bacteria causing VAP was undertaken. Poisson regression analysis between complete microbiological data and antibiotic consumption was performed. In total, 252 episodes of VAP in 184 patients were identified between 2007 and 2011, from which 364 causal bacteria were isolated. Enterobacteriaceae isolation rates increased significantly over this period [from 6.64 to 10.52 isolates/1000 patient-days; P=0.006], mostly due to an increase in AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae (APE) (2.85-4.51 isolates/1000 patient-days; P=0.013), whereas the number of episodes due to S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa remained stable. A positive association was found between the increase in APE infections and an increase in past-year antibiotic consumption: amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (P=0.003), ceftazidime and cefepime (P=0.007), carbapenems (P=0.002), fluoroquinolones (P=0.012), macrolides (P=0.002) and imidazoles (P=0.004). No such association was found for the emergence of resistance in P. aeruginosa. These results indicate a change in the epidemiology of VAP, with Enterobacteriaceae exceeding P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. Moreover, a positive correlation was observed between antibiotic consumption and the incidence of potentially MDRB such as APE. No such correlation was found for ESBL-producing Escherichia coli and antibiotic-resistant P. aeruginosa.
