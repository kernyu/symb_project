Febrile neutropenia in cancer patients is associated with a high mortality. Patients are frequently admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for severe sepsis or septic shock. Empirical antibiotic treatment, including monotherapy beta-lactam covering Pseudomonas aeruginosa, must be prompt. The ICU management is slightly different, due to a particular microbial ecology. A standardized approach to obtain a microbiological documentation is the cornerstone in these patients, leading to an adapted antimicrobial treatment. Systematic reassessment of initial antibiotic regimen should be realised. Neutropenic patients with severe sepsis or septic shock should receive promptly a beta-lactam-aminoglycoside combination, as well as glycopeptides in case of severity or absence of documented infection. Early catheter removal should be considered widely. In the actual context of growing resistance, antibiotics saving became a major concern. According to context and microbial documentation, an escalade or de-escalade approach is recommended, to take into account multi-resistant pathogens. The addition of antifugal treatment is also a major issue in these patients and has well-defined indications. In neutropenic patients admitted in the ICU for severe sepsis or septic shock, controlling local microbial epidemiology and the emergence of multi-resistant bacteria are the key issues.
