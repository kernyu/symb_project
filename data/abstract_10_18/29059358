Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic used for the treatment of Gram-positive infections including complicated skin and skin structure infections, right-sided infective endocarditis, bacteraemia, meningitis, sepsis and urinary tract infections. Daptomycin has distinct mechanisms of action, disrupting multiple aspects of cell membrane function and inhibiting protein, DNA and RNA synthesis. Although daptomycin resistance in Gram-positive bacteria is uncommon, there are increasing reports of daptomycin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis. Such resistance is seen largely in the context of prolonged treatment courses and infections with high bacterial burdens, but may occur in the absence of prior daptomycin exposure. Furthermore, use of inadequate treatment regimens, irregular drug supply and poor drug quality have also been recognized as other important risk factors for emergence of daptomycin-resistant strains. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Gram-positive bacteria, communication between clinicians and laboratories, establishment of internet-based reporting systems, development of better and more rapid diagnostic methods and continuous monitoring of drug resistance are urgent priorities.
