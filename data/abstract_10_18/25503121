RX-3117 (fluorocyclopentenylcytosine) is a cytidine analog and this class of drugs, including gemcitabine, has been widely used for the treatment of various types of cancers. However, there is no oral formulation of gemcitabine and drug resistance to gemcitabine is common. In this study, the efficacy of orally-administered RX-3117 was examined in 9 different human tumor xenograft models (colon, non-small cell lung, small cell lung, pancreatic, renal and cervical), grown subcutaneously in athymic nude mice. In the Colo 205, H460, H69 and CaSki models, gemcitabine treatment resulted in 28%, 30%, 25% and 0% tumor growth inhibition (TGI), respectively, whereas oral treatment with RX-3117 induced 100%, 78%, 62% and 66% TGI, respectively. This indicates that RX-3117 may have the potential to be used for the treatment of tumors that do not respond to gemcitabine. RX-3117 was also evaluated in a single primary low-passage human pancreatic TumorgraftCTG-0298 (TGI 76%), which is relatively resistant to gemcitabine (TGI 38%) and has a favorable RX-3117-activating enzyme profile. These studies demonstrated the therapeutic potential and anticancer efficacy of RX-3117.
