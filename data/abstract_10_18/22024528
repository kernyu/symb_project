BACKGROUND: HIV-HBV-coinfected individuals who need to be treated only for their HBV infection have limited therapeutic options, since most approved anti-HBV agents have a risk of selecting for drug-resistant HIV mutants. In vivo data are inconclusive as to whether telbivudine (LdT) may exert antiviral effects against HIV. Thus, we investigated in further detail the antiviral activity and the biochemical properties of LdT against HIV-1. METHODS: To investigate the activity of LdT against HIV-1 in humans we analysed viral dynamics and genotypic and phenotypic resistance development in two HIV-HBV-coinfected individuals with no prior antiviral exposure. To investigate the activity of LdT against HIV-1 in vitro, LdT susceptibility for HIV-1 wild-type strains as well as drug-resistant strains was determined. Furthermore, we studied whether the 5'-triphosphate form of LdT (LdT-TP) can act as a substrate for wild-type HIV-1 RT. RESULTS: In the two patients studied, LdT treatment did not result in a significant decline of HIV-1 RNA load nor in selection of genotypic or phenotypic resistance in HIV-1 RT. In vitro virological analyses demonstrated that LdT had no activity (50% effective concentration >100 muM) against wild type HIV and drug-resistant variants. Biochemical analyses demonstrated that LdT-TP is not incorporated by wild-type HIV-1 RT. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the in vivo and in vitro evidence obtained in this study, we conclude that LdT has no anti-HIV-1 activity and is currently the only selective anti-HBV agent among the five FDA-approved nucleoside/nucleotide analogues for treatment of HBV infections in HIV-infected individuals.
