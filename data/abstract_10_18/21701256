BACKGROUND: Despite advances in traumatic wound care and management, infections remain a leading cause of mortality,morbidity and economic disruption in millions of wound patients around the world. Animal models have become standard tools for studying a wide array of external traumatic wound infections and testing new antimicrobial strategies. RESULTS: Animal models of external traumatic wound infections reported by different investigators vary in animal species used, microorganism strains, the number of microorganisms applied, the size of the wounds and for burn infections, the length of time the heated object or liquid is in contact with the skin. METHODS: This review covers experimental infections in animal models of surgical wounds, skin abrasions, burns, lacerations,excisional wounds and open fractures. CONCLUSIONS: As antibiotic resistance continues to increase,more new antimicrobial approaches are urgently needed.These should be tested using standard protocols for infections in external traumatic wounds in animal models.
