X-DING-CD4 blocks HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) and pathogen induced pro-inflammatory response. Increased activity of the X-DING-CD4 gene is associated with cellular resistance to virus; therefore, HIV-1 elite controllers (ECs) should have higher X-DING-CD4 and reduced pro-inflammatory mRNA activity than viremic or uninfected individuals. Also, depending on the cell stimulating factor, expression of X-DING-CD4 mRNA in ECs might be autonomous or contingent on IFN signaling. We compared expression of X-DING-CD4, IFN-alpha and IL-8 mRNAs in naive, phytohemagglutinin- or HIV-1 exposed PBMCs from ECs, HIV progressors and negative controls; tested correlation between X-DING-CD4 and IFN-alpha expression; sensitivity of the X-DING-CD4 gene to IFN-alpha regulation; and evaluated interactions between innate and pro-inflammatory genes. We found that expression of X-DING-CD4 and IFN-alpha was up-regulated in ECs and correlated in cells stimulated with mitogen, but not HIV-1. The X-DING-CD4 gene was more sensitive to HIV-1 than rIFN-alpha stimulation. ECs had significantly less IL-8 mRNA when PBMCs were exposed to exogenous HIV-1. Two-way ANOVA showed that control of HIV-1 and virus-induced pro-inflammatory response by ECs stemmed from interactions between expression of innate immunity and pro-inflammatory genes, the state of cell stimulation and the status of virus control. Consequently, interaction of multiple host innate immune responses rather than a single mechanism regulates restriction of HIV-1 in ECs.
