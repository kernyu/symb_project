Staphylococcus lugdunensis has emerged as a significant human pathogen, with distinct clinical and microbiological characteristics. Our goal was to identify the virulence factors in S. lugdunensis recovered from infected patients of two Greek hospitals during a six-year period (2008-2013). A collection of 38 S. lugdunensis was tested for biofilm formation, antimicrobial susceptibility, clonal distribution, virulence factors (ica operon, fbl, atlL, vwbl, slush) and antibiotic resistance genes (mecA, ermC) carriage. Strains were classified into pulsotypes by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of SmaI DNA digests. The majority (22) was isolated from skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs), nine from deep-sited infections (DSIs), including three bacteraemias and seven from prosthetic device-associated infections (PDAIs). All isolates were oxacillin-susceptible, mecA-negative and fbl-positive. The highest resistance rate was detected for ampicillin (50%), followed by erythromycin and clindamycin (18.4%). Fourteen isolates (36.8%) produced biofilm, whereas 26/38 (68.4%) carried the ica operon. Biofilm formation was more frequent in isolates from PDAIs. Thirty-six strains (94.7%) carried atlL and 31 (81.6%) carried vwbl, whereas slush was detected in 15 (39.5%). PFGE revealed a low level of genetic diversity: strains were classified into seven pulsotypes, with two major clones (C: 22 and D: nine strains). Type C strains recovered from all infection sites prevailed in biofilm formation and ermC carriage, whereas type D strains associated with SSTIs and DSIs carried more frequently vwbl, slush or both genes. Despite susceptibility to antimicrobials, the clonal expansion and carriage of virulence factors, combined with biofilm-producing ability, render this species an important pathogen that should not be ignored.
