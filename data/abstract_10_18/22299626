This editorial summarizes recent developments in the management of ganciclovir-resistant human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infections. All current drugs available for systemic treatment, including ganciclovir (GCV), valganciclovir, foscarnet and cidofovir, target the viral polymerase. However, all such compounds are hampered by dose-related toxicities and the emergence of resistance. Different approaches (e.g., PCR-based direct sequencing, pyrosequencing, mass spectrometry-based comparative sequencing) allow the fast detection of resistant HCMV and are well suited to therapy monitoring. However, more studies are required on the dynamic of mixed HCMV populations under drug pressure. Alternate antiviral compounds with new mechanisms of action, such as artesunate, leflunomid, letermovir and maribavir, are now being investigated in clinical studies. An advantage of some of the new substances is lesser toxicity issues, which might lead to new prophylactic and treatment strategies.
