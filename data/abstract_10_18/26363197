Clostridium butyricum is a Gram-positive bacterium involved in the development of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in preterm infants. To colonize the digestive tract, components of the cell wall of C. butyricum must interact with the intestinal mucosa. The D-alanylation of cell wall components such as teichoic acids results in a net positive charge on the cell wall, which is important for many functions of Gram-positive bacteria. Notably, D-alanylation mediates resistance to antimicrobial peptides and antibiotics. Here, we show that the dlt operon of C. butyricum encodes the enzymes responsible for the D-alanylation of cell wall components and influences the surface properties of the cell wall. We show that the D-alanylation of cell wall components controls the septation of C. butyricum, which is an essential mechanism during vegetative growth. Furthermore, we find that D-alanylation is involved in the resistance of C. butyricum to some cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) and lysozyme. Finally, we show that the D-alanylation of cell wall components influences vancomycin-induced lysis.
