In this study, a fluorogenic heterotrophic plate count test for drinking water was modified in order to detect the presence of carbapenem-resistant bacteria. Antimicrobial agents and concentrations were selected based on recoveries of known carbapenem-resistant and carbapenem-susceptible strains inoculated into simulated samples. The modified method was field-tested on 19 drinking water samples from the New Delhi, India distribution system. Samples exhibiting fluorescence indicated bacterial growth in the presence of the supplemented antimicrobial agents, and organisms from these samples were cultured. Twenty-one Gram-negative isolates were identified from nine of the 19 samples and the meropenem minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined. Ultimately, eight carbapenem-resistant organisms were isolated from five sampling sites within the New Delhi water distribution system.
