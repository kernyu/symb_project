In GES-type beta-lactamases, positions 104 and 170 are occupied by Glu or Lys and by Gly, Asn, or Ser, respectively. Previous studies have indicated an important role of these amino acids in the interaction with beta-lactams, although their precise role, especially that of residue 104, remains uncertain. In this study, we constructed GES-1 (Glu104, Gly170), GES-2 (Glu104, Asn170), GES-5 (Glu104, Ser170), GES-6 (Lys104, Ser170), GES-7 (Lys104, Gly170), and GES-13 (Lys104, Asn170) by site-specific mutagenesis and compared their hydrolytic properties. Isogenic comparisons of beta-lactam resistance levels conferred by these GES variants were also performed. Data indicated the following patterns: (i) Lys104-containing enzymes exhibited enhanced hydrolysis of oxyimino-cephalosporins and reduced efficiency against imipenem in relation to enzymes possessing Glu104, (ii) Asn170-containing enzymes showed reduced hydrolysis rates of penicillins and older cephalosporins, (iii) Ser170 enabled GES to hydrolyze cefoxitin efficiently, and (iv) Asn170 and Ser170 increased the carbapenemase character of GES enzymes but reduced their activity against ceftazidime. Molecular dynamic simulations of GES apoenzyme models, as well as construction of GES structures complexed with cefoxitin and an achiral ceftazidime-like boronic acid, provided insights into the catalytic behavior of the studied mutants. There were indications that an increased stability of the hydrogen bonding network of Glu166-Lys73-Ser70 and an altered positioning of Trp105 correlated with the substrate spectra, especially with acylation of GES by imipenem. Furthermore, likely effects of Ser170 on GES interactions with cefoxitin and of Lys104 on interactions with oxyimino-cephalosporins were revealed. Overall, the data unveiled the importance of residues 104 and 170 in the function of GES enzymes.
