The purpose of this study was to investigate if multiresistant methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MR-MSSA) causing a clonal outbreak in Ostergotland County, Sweden, were derived from methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) by carrying remnants of SCCmec, and, if so, to characterise this element. A total of 54 MSSA isolates with concomitant resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin and tobramycin from 49 patients (91% clonally related, spa type t002) were investigated with the BD GeneOhm MRSA assay and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the SCCmec integration site/SCCmec right extremity junction. DNA sequencing of one isolate representing the MR-MSSA outbreak clone was performed by massive parallel 454 pyrosequencing. All isolates that were part of the clonal outbreak carried SCCmec remnants. The DNA sequencing revealed the carriage of a pseudo-SCC element 12 kb in size, with a genomic organisation identical to an SCCmec type IotaIota element, except for a 41-kb gap. This study demonstrates the presence of a pseudo-SCC element resembling SCCmec type II among MR-MSSA, suggesting possible derivation from MRSA. The presence of SCCmec remnants should always be considered when SCCmec typing is used for MRSA detection, and may not be suitable in locations with a high prevalence of MR-MSSA, since this might give a high number of false-positive results.
