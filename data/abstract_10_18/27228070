Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a leading cause of hospital-acquired infections and is resistant to most antibiotics. With therapeutic options against P. aeruginosa dwindling, and the lack of new antibiotics in advanced developmental stages, strategies for preserving the effectiveness of current antibiotics are urgently required. beta-Lactam antibiotics are important agents for treating P. aeruginosa infections, thus, adjuvants that potentiate the activity of these compounds are desirable for extending their lifespan while new antibiotics - or antibiotic classes - are discovered and developed. In this review, we discuss recent research that has identified exploitable targets of cell-wall metabolism for the design and development of compounds that hinder resistance and potentiate the activity of antipseudomonal beta-lactams.
