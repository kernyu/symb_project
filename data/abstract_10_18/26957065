OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical characteristics, antibiotics sensitivity, outcome and risk factors of neonatal septicemia caused by Candida haemulonii. METHOD: A retrospective analysis was performed on clinical characteristics and antibiotics sensitivity after 8 cases of neonatal septicemia caused by Candida haemulonii were identified; each of these patients had at least one positive result of bacterial culture for Candida haemulonii. RESULT: The 8 cases born at gestational age of 178-260 d, weighing 835-2 055 g, developed the infection from May to July at 10-34 d after hospitalization. Among the 8 patients, 7 were cured, 1 died during hospitalization after the treatments were given up because of serious complications. The 8 patients with septicemia caused by Candida haemulonii had similar clinical chariacteristics to those of other neonatal candidemia, such as apnea, fever, abdominal distension, jaundice etc. They had abnormal auxiliary examination with increased C-reactive protein (CRP), declined platelet (PLT) count to different degrees. All of the 8 patients had peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) and broad-spectrum antibiotics were applied. C. haemulonii as an emergent fungal pathogen had varying degrees of resistance to fluconazole, amphotericin B, itraconazole, or ketone, but was susceptible to voriconazole. CONCLUSION: The characteristics of neonatal septicemia caused by Candida haemulonii were similar to those caused by other candida, and the main risk factors are the low birth weight, PICC, and usage of broad-spectrum antibiotics. It mainly occurred in May to July which is hot and humid season.
