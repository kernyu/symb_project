Various antiprotozoal drugs have been used to counteract the spread of giardiasis. However, due to increase in resistance to these compounds, there is an urgent need to find a natural biocompatible product to fight the pathogen in more healthy and effective way. The present study was designed to compare the therapeutic effect of probiotic Lactobacillus casei alone and in conjunction with antiprotozoal drugs on the outcome of giardiasis in murine model. BALB/c mice were challenged with Giardia intestinalis trophozoites, and 1 day after infection, these mice were treated with either probiotic alone or in conjunction with antiprotozoal drugs. Cyst, trophozoite, and lactobacilli counts were monitored vis-a-vis histopathological alterations in the small intestine. It was found that albendazole administered orally 1 day after Giardia infection was the most effective antiprotozoal drug among albendazole, tinidazole, metronidazole, and nitazoxanide. It reduced both the severity and duration of giardiasis. More specifically, oral administration of the probiotic L. casei in conjunction with albendazole further reduced the Giardia infection as was evident by the restored normal gut morphology. This suggests that probiotics and antiprotozoal drugs in combination may be the better alternative therapy for treatment of gastrointestinal diseases and enhanced recovery.
