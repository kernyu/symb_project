INTRODUCTION: Infections are the most common complications in the burn patients admitted to the hospitals leading to high morbidity and mortality. Klebsiella is one of the most frequently isolated bacteria from burn wounds. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Klebsiella isolates from burn patients. In this cross- sectional study wound swabs from 1294 patients hospitalized in burnward were collected for bacteriological examination. Antibiotic sensitivity testing of Klebsiella isolates was done by modified Stokes disc diffusion method. RESULTS: Out of 883 isolates from 1294 patients 195 were found to be Klebsiella spp. Based on the biochemical properties 153 isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 37 were Klebsiella oxytoca and 5 were others species. In our study we found that 54% of the Klebsiella isolates were multidrug resistant as they were resistant to at least one antibiotic of three or more different groups of antibiotics. [Table: see text]. CONCLUSION: Rate of isolation of Klebsiella as well as its resistance for commonly used antibiotics is increasing over the time.
