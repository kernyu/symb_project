Silver nanoparticles form promising template for designing antimicrobial agents against drug resistant pathogenic microorganisms. Thus, the development of a reliable green approach for the synthesis of nanoparticles is an important aspect of current nanotechnology research. In the present investigation, silver nanoparticles synthesized by a soil Bacillus sp. were characterized using UV-vis spectroscopy, FTIR, SEM, and EDS. The antibacterial potential of biosynthesized silver nanoparticles, standard antibiotics, and their conjugates were evaluated against multidrug-resistant biofilm-forming coagulase-negative S. epidermidis strains, S. aureus, Salmonella Typhi, Salmonella Paratyphi, and V. cholerae. Interestingly, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) showed remarkable antibacterial activity against all the test strains with the highest activity against S. epidermidis strains 145 and 152. In addition, the highest synergistic effect of AgNPs was observed with chloramphenicol against Salmonella typhi. The results of the study clearly indicate the promising biomedical applications of biosynthesized AgNPs.
