Macrolides have diverse biological activities and an ability to modulate inflammation and immunity in eukaryotes without affecting homeostatic immunity. These properties have led to their long-term use in treating neutrophil-dominated inflammation in diffuse panbronchiolitis, bronchiectasis, rhinosinusitis, and cystic fibrosis. These immunomodulatory activities appear to be polymodal, but evidence suggests that many of these effects are due to inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation. Macrolides accumulate within cells, suggesting that they may associate with receptors or carriers responsible for the regulation of cell cycle and immunity. A concern is that long-term use of macrolides increases the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Nonantimicrobial macrolides are now in development as potential immunomodulatory therapies.
