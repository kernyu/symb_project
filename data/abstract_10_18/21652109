According to the literature and to the advice of experts, the French Agency for the Safety of Health Products (AFSSAPS) edited recommendations about the antibioprophylaxis in ocular surgery. One goal was to avoid the extensive use of oral and topical fluoroquinolones in antibioprophylaxis, in order to preserve their antibacterial activity for curative treatments of severe eye infections. The medical team decides for the indication and the type of antibioprophylaxis for each patient. A topical antibiotic is recommended for any eye surgery until the etancheity of incisions. Due to the risk of selection of bacterial resistance topical fluoroquinolones are not recommended in this indication. In open eye surgery, an additional antibioprophylaxis is recommended: in cataract surgery, injection in the anterior chamber at the end of the procedure of 1mg of cefuroxime; in other open eye surgeries, only in case of risk factors for endophthalmitis, administration of 500 mg oral levofloxacin tablet 12 hours and two hours before surgery. For ocular punctures and intravitreal injections, only a topical postoperative antibiotic is recommended until healing.
