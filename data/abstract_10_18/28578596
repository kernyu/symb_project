Staphylococcus pseudintermedius is an opportunistic pathogen of dogs and cats. A high-resolution melting analysis (HRMA) protocol was designed and tested on 42 clinical isolates with known fluoroquinolone (FQ) susceptibility and gyrA codon 84 and grlA codon 80 mutation status. The HRMA approach was able to discriminate between FQ-sensitive and FQ-resistant strains and confirmed previous reports that the main mutation site associated with FQ resistance in S. pseudintermedius is located at position 251 (Ser84Leu) of gyrA. Routine, HRMA-based FQ susceptibility profiles may be a valuable tool to guide therapy. The FQ resistance-predictive power of the assay should be tested in a significantly larger number of isolates.
