In view of the emergence and frequency of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis and consequences of acquired resistance to clinically used drugs, we undertook the design and synthesis of novel prototypes that possess the advantage of the two pharmacophores of thiourea and 1,3,4-thiadiazole in a single molecular backbone. Three compounds from our series were distinguished from the others by their promising activity profiles against Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain H37Rv. Compounds 11 and 19 were the most active representatives with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 10.96 and 11.48 microM, respectively. Compound 15 was shown to inhibit M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv with an MIC value of 17.81 microM. Cytotoxicity results in the Vero cell line showed that these three derivatives had selectivity indices between 1.8 and 8.7. In order to rationalize the biological results of our compounds, molecular docking studies with the enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (InhA) of M. tuberculosis were performed and compounds 11, 15, and 19 were found to have good docking scores in the range of -7.12 to -7.83 kcal/mol.
