Pseudomonas Aeruginosa is one of the leading opportunistic infectious agents especially in immune-suppressed patients such like burn victims. Carbapenems like Imipenem (IMP) and Meropenem (MEM) are the choice antimicrobial drugs, which used in the treatment of Penicillin and Aminoglycoside-resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa isolates. Based on the importance of the detection of infectious source and their resistance transfer algorithm have a main effect on the control of nosocomial infections this study designed for to consider the antibiotic sensitivity and the genetic pattern of Pseudomonas Aeruginosa isolate in burned patients hospitalized in Ghotbeddin Shirazi Hospital with RAPD-PCR technique. According to the Antibiogram results, the most sensitivity was related to the Gentamicin with 50% while the most resistant related to the Nalidixic Acid, Erythromycin, and Cefotaxime with 90% resistant to all. With RAPD-PCR technique used primers 272, 277 and 287 were detected 18, 15, and 11 algorithms respectively. RAPD-PCR is a genotyping method with a high efficiency and good for the study of bacterial epidemiology and polymorphism.
