A collection of 2-aminoimidazole/triazole amides has been synthesized and screened for antibiofilm activity. This class of small molecules was found to modulate the biofilm activity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a multidrug-resistant strain of Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAB), a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Rhodospirillum salexigens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Vibrio vulnificus, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium as well as the yeast Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. Furthermore, lead compounds were found to not lyse red blood cells at active concentrations.
