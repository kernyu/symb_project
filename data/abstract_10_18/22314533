Screening for in vitro susceptibility to pyrimethamine and sequencing of the pfmdr2 and pfdhfr genes were performed in 140 Plasmodium falciparum isolates. The risk of in vitro resistance to pyrimethamine was analyzed with a logistic regression model. The mutation F423Y in pfmdr2 (odds ratio [OR] = 2.12 [confidence interval {CI}, 1.02 to 4.59]; P = 0.0489) and the mutation N51I, C59R, or S108N in pfdhfr (OR = 42.34 [CI, 5.52 to 324.61]; P = 0.0003) were independently associated with in vitro resistance to pyrimethamine.
