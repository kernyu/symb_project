The global emergence of multidrug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii has reduced the number of clinically available antibiotics that retain activity against this pathogen. For this reason, the development of novel prevention and treatment strategies for infections caused by A. baumannii is necessary. Several studies have begun to characterize nonantibiotic approaches that utilize novel mechanisms of action to achieve antibacterial activity. Recent advances in phage therapy, iron chelation therapy, antimicrobial peptides, prophylactic vaccination, photodynamic therapy, and nitric oxide (NO)-based therapies have all been shown to have activity against A. baumannii. However, before these approaches can be used clinically there are still limitations and remaining questions that must be addressed.
