OBJECTIVE: To explore darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) plus raltegravir (RAL) combination therapy in antiretroviral-naive patients. DESIGN: Phase IIb, single-arm, open-label, multicenter study. METHODS: One hundred and twelve antiretroviral-naive, HIV-1-infected patients received DRV/r 800/100 mg once daily and RAL 400 mg twice daily. Primary endpoint was virologic failure by week 24. Virologic failure was defined as confirmed viral load of 1000 copies/ml or more at week 12, or an increase of more than 0.5 log(10) copies/ml in viral load from week 4 to 12, or a confirmed viral load of more than 50 copies/ml at or after week 24. Protease and integrase genes were sequenced in patients experiencing virologic failure. RESULTS: Virologic failure rate was 16% [95% confidence interval (CI) 10-24] by week 24 and 26% (95% CI 19-36) by week 48 in an intent-to-treat analysis. Viral load at virologic failure was 51-200 copies/ml in 17/28 failures. Adjusting for age and sex, virologic failure was associated with baseline viral load of more than 100,000 copies/ml [hazard ratio 3.76, 95% CI (1.52-9.31), P = 0.004] and lower CD4 cell count [0.77 per 100 cells/mul increase (95% CI 0.61-0.98), P = 0.037]. When trough RAL concentrations were included as a time-varying covariate in the analysis, virologic failure remained associated with baseline viral load more than 100,000 copies/ml [hazard ratio = 4.67 (95% CI 1.93-11.25), P < 0.001], whereas RAL level below detection limit in plasma at one or more previous visits was associated with increased hazard [hazard ratio = 3.42 (95% CI 1.41-8.26), P = 0.006]. All five participants with integrase mutations during virologic failure had baseline viral load more than 100,000 copies/ml. CONCLUSION: DRV/r plus RAL was effective and well tolerated in most patients, but virologic failure and integrase resistance were common, particularly in patients with baseline viral load more than 100,000 copies/ml.
