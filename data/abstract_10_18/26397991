Pancreatic cancer is a highly aggressive malignancy with a notoriously dismal prognosis. A major contributor to this poor clinical outcome is pancreatic cancer's prominent chemoresistance. The present study was undertaken to determine whether the flavonoid phydroxycinnamic acid (HCA), which is a botanical factor, possesses anticancer effects on cloned human pancreatic cancer MIA PaCa2 cells that possess resistance to radiation therapy in vitro. Proliferation of MIA PaCa2 cells was suppressed after culture with HCA (101,000 nM). Such an effect was also noted in human pancreatic cancer Pt45P1 cells. In the MIA PaCa2 cells, HCA induced G1 and G2/M phase cell cycle arrest in the cells. The suppressive effects of HCA on proliferation were suggested to be mediated through the inhibition of various signaling pathways related to nuclear factorkappaB (NFkappaB), extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK), protein kinase C, phosphatidylinositol 3kinase (PI3K) or nuclear transcription activity. Moreover, HCA was found to stimulate cell death in the MIA PaCa2 and Pt45P1 cells in vitro. The anticancer effects of HCA on MIA PaCa2 cells were exhibited at a lower concentration than gemcitabine, a potent cancer drug. The flavonoid HCA may be a useful tool in the therapy of human pancreatic cancer in vivo.
