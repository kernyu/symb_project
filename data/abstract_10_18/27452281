We conducted a pilot study to evaluate the resistance and cross-resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to imipenem and ciprofloxacin. Our results highlight the importance of the judicious use of antibiotics, particularly fluoroquinolones, amidst the limited arsenal of effective antibiotics against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the risk of cross-resistance induction.
