The TRUGENE HIV-1 Genotyping Kit for HIV-1 drug resistance testing is limited by the need for samples with HIV-1 RNA loads of at least 1000 copies/mL. In order to enable sequencing of clinical samples with viral loads under 1000 copies/mL, an optimized automated sample preparation protocol on the VERSANT kPCR Sample Preparation (SP) Module was evaluated. In order to prove the concept of successful sequencing of low-titer clinical samples with the optimized protocol, a dilution series of a routine clinical sample was analyzed. Furthermore, 57 routine clinical samples with viral loads below 1000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL were tested. Finally, samples obtained from two patients with low viral loads were tested retrospectively for HIV-1 drug resistances and results were compared with those of the preceding and the subsequent sample. The dilution containing 92 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL was the lowest yielding an analyzable sequence with the optimized protocol. When routine clinical samples with viral loads between 100 and 1000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL were tested, a sequence was obtained in 90.5%. Samples with low viral load of two patients that could not be analyzed with the routine protocol showed identical drug mutations in both, the low viral-load and the subsequent samples. Together with the optimized automated sample preparation protocol, the TRUGENE HIV-1 Genotyping Kit allows successful sequencing of the majority of samples with HIV-1 RNA loads between 100 and 1000 copies/mL. Detection of resistance mutations in low viral-load samples may lead to an earlier optimized antiretroviral therapy.
