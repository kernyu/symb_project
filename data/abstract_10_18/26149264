BACKGROUND: Due to resistance to all classes of anti-HIV drugs and drug toxicity, there is a need for the discovery and development of new anti-HIV drugs. METHODS: HIV-1 inhibitors were identified and biologically characterized for mechanism of action. RESULTS: We identified a dibenzocyclooctadiene lignan, termed HDS2 that possessed anti-HIV activity against a wide variety of viral strains with EC50 values in the 1-3 microM range. HDS2 was shown to act as an NNRTI by qPCR and in vitro enzyme assays. CONCLUSIONS: This compound provides a new scaffold for further optimization of activity through structure-guided design.
