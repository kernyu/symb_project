OBJECTIVES: The uses of antimicrobials contribute an important selection of multiresistant bacteria in the digestive microbiota of pigs. Alternative use for antibiotics to reduce bacterial resistance in the digestive flora of animals is recommended. AIMS: of study was to evaluate by comparative study the level of selection of antibiotic-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in the digestive microbiota of piglets when using amoxicillin and Algo-bio((R)). METHODS: Administration was carried out over a period of five days at the dose of 1ml/10kg/of body weight. A phenotypic study was carried out with the enumeration of resistant Enterobacteriaceae from MacConkey agar with presence and absence of amoxicillin. E. coli isolates were identified and subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility test. RESULTS: The percentages of amoxicillin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae before treatment were between 10 and 15% for the four groups of piglets. After starting treatment, from the second day to the fifth day, the percentages were greater than 50% and evolving from 54 to 87% for the groups treated with amoxicillin. In the group treated with Algo-Bio((R)) and controls the percentages were less than 50%. During days of treatments, the percentage of amoxicillin-resistant E. coli strains to the associated antibiotics such as nalidixic acid, trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole, streptomycin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol evolved during the treatments. In the control and Algo-Bio((R)) piglets groups, the percentages of E. coli resistant antibiotics did not increase. CONCLUSION: We believe that Algo-Bio((R)) constitute a good alternative prophylactic to antibiotics to reduce bacterial growth in the digestive tract of animals.
