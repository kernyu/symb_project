The purpose of this study was to investigate the clonal structure, antimicrobial resistance phenotypes and their determinants among early vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREm) isolates in Poland. Two hundred and eighty-one VREm isolates collected between 1997 and 2005 were studied. VREm isolates were characterised by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The presence of antimicrobial resistance determinants, transposon-specific genes, IS16 and esp Efm was checked by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Ciprofloxacin and ampicillin resistance determinants were investigated by sequencing. Two hundred and twenty-two (79 %) and 59 (21 %) VREm isolates were vanA- and vanB-positive, respectively. Among 135 representative isolates, MLST yielded 33 different sequence types (STs), of which 29 were characteristic of hospital-associated E. faecium; 128 (94.8 %) and 123 (91.1 %) isolates harboured the IS16 and esp Efm genes, and all 135 isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin and ampicillin. Resistance to tetracycline (71.1 % isolates) was mostly associated with tetM (75.0 %) and the concomitant presence of the Tn916 integrase gene. High-level resistance to streptomycin (93.3 % of isolates) and high-level resistance to gentamicin (94.1 % of isolates) were due to ant(6')-Ia and aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'') genes, respectively, the latter of which is known to be located on various Tn4001-type transposons. Fifteen combinations of mutations in the quinolone-determining regions of GyrA and ParC were identified, including changes not previously reported, such as S83F and A84P in GyrA. Twenty-three variants of the penicillin-binding protein PBP5 occurred in the studied group, and novel insertions at amino acid positions 433 and 568 were identified. This analysis revealed the predominance of hospital-associated strains of E. faecium, carrying an abundant and divergent range of resistance determinants among early VREm isolates in Poland.
