Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common extraintestinal infectious disease entity in women worldwide, and perhaps one of the most formidable challenges in clinical practice given its high prevalence, frequent recurrence, and myriad associated morbidities in the setting of rapidly evolving antimicrobial resistance. Achieving timely symptom relief and infection control and preventing morbidity, growth of resistant organisms, and recurrent infection are often difficult. This article reviews epidemiology and pathogenesis of urinary tract infection in women; characterizes common patterns of infection, clinical red flags, and appropriate laboratory testing and imaging; explores emerging patterns of antimicrobial resistance; and reviews the updated guidelines for the treatment of uncomplicated UTI in women.
