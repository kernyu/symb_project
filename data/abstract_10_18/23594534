Today, nanotechnology is finding applications in medicine. The unique physical and chemical properties of nanoparticles can overcome barriers and allow them to gain access to biological systems. Because of the increasing prevalence of microbial resistance to conventional therapies, the development of novel antimicrobials is imperative. Creating nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems with antibacterial and immunomodulatory activities may lead to novel treatments for cutaneous pathogens.
