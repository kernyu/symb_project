IN NEONATOLOGY, EVIDENCE-BASED practice (EBP) relies on well-designed, adequately powered trials to guide practitioners. Several large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted to explore the use of fluconazole for fungal prophylaxis in premature infants. Despite the findings of these studies, practice varies among units. In a recent survey of members of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), 34 percent of clinicians indicated that they have used antifungal prophylaxis and only 11 percent of clinicians indicated that a written protocol was in place in their NICU. Intravenous (IV) fluconazole (66 percent), oral nystatin (59 percent), and IV amphotericin (21 percent) were the three most commonly used agents among the respondents.1.
