A carbapenemase-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strain, clone ST258 producing KPC-3, was fully characterized. The entire plasmid content was investigated, thereby identifying plasmids of the IncFII(k) (two of them similar to pKPQIL and pKPN3, respectively), IncX, and ColE types, carrying a formidable set of resistance genes against toxic compounds, metals, and antimicrobial drugs and a novel iron(III) uptake system.
