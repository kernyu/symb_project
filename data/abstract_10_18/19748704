BACKGROUND: Several countries have conducted studies to assess the status of their infection control programs (ICP) with the objective of improving quality of infection control practices. METHODS: To assess the perceptions and attitudes of the health care workers (HCW) concerning ICP in Brazilian hospitals, we conducted a cross-sectional survey using a self-administered online questionnaire during a Web-based course (WBC) on infection control (IC) and antimicrobial resistance (AR). RESULTS: Of 6256 Brazilian HCW registered for the WBC, 1998 were members of infection control committees (ICC) and answered the survey. Eight hundred six (40.4%) respondents said that an ICP was established for more than 10 years in their institutions. Most professionals reported that their hospitals perform microbiologic surveillance targeted at epidemiologically important multidrug-resistant organisms, but the majority underestimated the prevalence of AR. CONCLUSION: Our survey highlights important information about the perceptions and attitudes of ICC members that may be used to tailor key interventions for implementing effective ICP. It suggests, additionally, that, to achieve countrywide standardized IC mechanisms in a developing country, authorities should consider the social, cultural, and economical disparities between regions and identify specific regional needs to make available the resources required to minimize such disparities.
