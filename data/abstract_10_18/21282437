To investigate the contribution of LamB in Klebsiella pneumoniae antimicrobial resistance, we determined the MICs of various antibiotics and the frequency of mutation to increased cefoxitin or meropenem resistance of the strains CSUB10S (expressing only OmpK36), CSUB10R (lacking OmpK35 and OmpK36), and their derived isogenic insertion-duplication mutants deficient in LamB. Expression of LamB was indispensable in order for CSUB10S to lose OmpK36 and become resistant to cefoxitin, while in CSUB10R, LamB deficiency promoted increased resistance to carbapenem.
