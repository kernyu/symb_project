The use of chemotherapy on a mass scale in endemic areas may lead to the appearance of resistant isolates through the mechanism of selective drug pressure. Studies have demonstrated that praziquantel (PZQ) is able to inhibit the excretory activity and to cause tegumental damage in Schistosoma mansoni adult worms. The use of the probe resorufin to evaluate excretory activity, as well as the probe Hoechst 33258 to detect tegumental damage in adult worms, may represent a method to identify resistant (or less susceptible) isolates. The purpose of the present work was to compare the changes caused by PZQ in the function of the excretory system and in the integrity of the tegument of adult worms from the LE isolate (susceptible to PZQ) and the LE-PZQ isolate (less susceptible to PZQ). Worms from the isolate LE-PZQ showed less severe tegumental lesions, in both in vitro and in vivo experiments, detected by labelling with Hoechst 33258 and continued to have a functional excretory system as shown by labelling with resorufin in vitro.
