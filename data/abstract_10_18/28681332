The last century, more precisely after 1945, was marked by major advances in the treatment of infectious diseases which promoted a decrease in mortality and morbidity. Despite these advances, currently the development of antimicrobial resistance has been growing drastically and therefore there is a pressing need to search for new compounds. Silver nanoparticles (AgNps) have been demonstrating good antimicrobial activity against different bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Curcumin (CUR) extracted from rhizomes of Curcuma longa has a variety of applications including antiinflammatory, antioxidant, and antibacterial agent. The association between silver nanoparticles and curcumin in a formulation can be a good alternative to control infectious diseases due the antimicrobial properties of both compounds. The objective of this work was to develop a formulation composed of a thermoresponsive gel-with antimicrobial and antioxidant properties due to the association of AgNps with PVP and PVA polymers. After AgNp synthesis, these were incorporated together with the previously prepared CUR/P407 (1:2) solid dispersion (SD) into a polymer dispersion of 20% P407 (thermosensitive gel). Our results showed that the association between the AgNps with CUR SD demonstrated good antioxidant activity as compared to the standard compound. Measures of MIC showed more efficacy against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) than for Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus). This association enhances antimicrobial activity against E. coli and P aeruginosa and added antioxidant value in formulations.
