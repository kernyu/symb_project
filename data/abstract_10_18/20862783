We report the first two cases of transmitted triple-class, drug-resistant HIV-1 in Australia. Baseline testing of a newly diagnosed man showed four reverse transcriptase resistance mutations (affecting two drug classes) and six protease resistance mutations. A source patient was identified, and a likely second case newly infected 1 year later, suggesting sequential transmission. This raises therapeutic implications for the individual patients, as well as public health concerns.
