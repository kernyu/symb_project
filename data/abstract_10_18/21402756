The present study examined the differential contribution of host genetic background and mycobacterial pathogen variability to biological and mechanistic phenotypes of infection. For this purpose, A/J and C57BL/6J mice were infected intravenously with a low dose of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv or the Russia, Japan, and Pasteur substrains of Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG). The pulmonary bacterial counts (number of CFU) and transcript levels of select cytokines (e.g., Ifng, Il12b, and Il4) at 1, 3, and 6 weeks postinfection were measured as biological and mechanistic phenotypes, respectively. The individual and combined impact of the host and mycobacteria on these phenotypes was assessed using three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), which partitions phenotypic variation into host, pathogen, time, and interaction effects. All phenotypes, except pulmonary Il4 transcript levels, displayed evidence for host-mycobacterium specificity by means of significant interaction terms. Pulmonary expression profiles of 34 chemokines and chemokine-related genes were compared across the hosts and mycobacteria. The differences in induction of these immune messenger genes between A/J and C57BL/6J mice were modest and generally failed to reach significance. In contrast, the mycobacteria induced significant variance in a subset of the immune messenger genes, which was more evident in A/J mice relative to that in C57BL/6J mice. Overall, the results demonstrated the importance of considering the joint effects of the mycobacterial and host genetic backgrounds on susceptibility to mycobacterial infections.
