BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the molecular characteristics of beta-lactamase genes in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates from Mongolia. METHODS: Fifty-six ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates were collected, of which 46 were Escherichia coli, seven were Klebsiella pneumoniae, and three were K. oxytoca. Minimum inhibitory concentrations for selected antibiotics were tested using the agar dilution method, and the beta-lactamase genes were determined using polymerase chain reaction combined with sequencing. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used for genotyping all isolates, and phylogenetic grouping was performed on ESBL-producing E. coli isolates. Conjugation tests combined with plasmid digestion assays were used to determine whether there was a horizontal spread in Mongolia. RESULTS: Among the 56 ESBL-producing isolates, 43 isolates (76.8%) were resistant to fluoroquinolones, but all isolates were susceptible to carbapenems and amikacin. The polymerase chain reaction sequencing results showed that the dominant CTX-M genotype was CTX-M-15 (19/46, 41.3%) in the ESBL-producing E. coli isolates. By contrast, CTX-M-14 and CTX-M-3 were the major genotypes found in Klebsiella spp. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 21 ESBL-producing E. coli isolates belonged to group D (21/46, 45.6%), followed by group A (13/46, 28.3%), group B2 (11/46, 23.9%), and group B1 (1/46, 2.2%). Only four E. coli isolates (4/46, 8.7%) belonged to the ST131 clone. PFGE showed that the ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae were genetically unrelated. The conjugation assay showed that two plasmids harboring CTX-M-15 in E. coli isolates were genetic unrelated, whereas seven plasmids harboring CTX-M-14 (5/7 and 2/7) and four plasmids harboring CTX-M-55 (4/4) showed genetic relatedness, indicating the dissemination of resistance plasmids in this area.
