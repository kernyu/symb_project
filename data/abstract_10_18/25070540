Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive solid malignancies with a dismal survival rate. Recent studies have shown that high expression levels of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) correlate with malignant phenotype. However, the expression patterns and biological role of HDAC3 in pancreatic cancer remain unclear. In this study, our data showed that a higher level of HDAC3 protein expression was found in pancreatic cancer as compared to paired paracancerous tissues. Consistently, higher expression level of HDAC3 was found in all of the eight pancreatic cancer cell lines relative to human pancreatic ductal epithelial cells (HPDE). In addition, further function analysis revealed that HDAC3 can function as oncogenic protein, which could promote pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and may increase drug resistance. Moreover, the functional involvement of HDAC3 was partially correlated with post-induction repression of P53, P27 and Bax gene transcription, acting via H3K9 deacetylation. Taken together, our data suggest that HDAC3 participates in the pathogenesis and progression of pancreatic cancer through histone modification, which might be a pivotal epigenetic target against this devastating disease.
