BACKGROUND: Bacterial infections pose a major challenge to risk management activities in the area of chronic haemodialysis, as vascular access-related infections are the main cause of mortality among these patients. METHODS: Prospective surveillance study lasting 7 months (March-September, 2008) at two haemodialysis units in a district health area Gran Canaria, Spain. We used the methodology proposed by CDC s Dialysis Surveillance Network. RESULTS: 1545 patients/month were recorded, 60.5% with an arteriovenous fistula (AVF), 35.5% with a permanent catheter (PC), 3.0% with grafts and 1.0% with temporary catheters. The rate of adverse events was 8.6 cases per 100 patients/month, 9.1 for AVF patients, and 2.9 for PC. Nevertheless, the other types of infections (respiratory, urinary tract, skin and chronic ulcers) showed similar rates. Microbiological cultures were taken in 82.2%, but this rate increased to 91.0% when a vascular access-related infection was suspected. Empirical treatment was adjusted to antibiogram results in 90.0% of occasions. A low incidence of multi-resistant microbes was observed. Gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria appeared in similar proportions. CONCLUSIONS: Vascular access is the main risk factor for infectious events. Epidemiological surveillance has allowed us to detect areas of improvement in different settings, acting as a key element in risk management and patient safety.
