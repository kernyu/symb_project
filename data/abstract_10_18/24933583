The overuse and misuse of antibiotics over many years has selected a high frequency of resistance among medically important bacterial pathogens. The evolution of resistance is complex, frequently involving multiple genetic alterations that minimize biological fitness costs and/or increase the resistance level. Resistance is selected at very low drug concentrations, such as found widely distributed in the environment, and this selects for resistant mutants with a high fitness. Once resistance with high fitness is established in a community it is very difficult to reduce its frequency. Addressing the problem of resistance is essential if we are to ensure a future where we can continue to enjoy effective medical control of bacterial infections. This will require several actions including the discovery and development of novel antibiotics, the creation of a continuous pipeline of drug discovery, and the implementation of effective global antibiotic stewardship to reduce the misuse of antibiotics and their release into the environment.
