INTRODUCTION: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common cause of serious infections in hospitalized patients and is associated with high rates of hospital morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors of nosocomial infections caused by piperacillin-tazobactam-resistant P.aeruginosa (PT-RPA). METHODS: A case-control study was conducted in the Clinical Centre Kragujevac from January 2010 to December 2011. RESULTS: In the observed period, 79 (38.16%) patients had PT-RPA infections, while 128 (61.84%) patients had infections caused by piperacillin-tazobactam-sensitive P. aeruginosa (PT-SPA). Pneumonia was more frequently found in the PT-RPA group (55.70%) (p < 0.05), whereas urinary tract infections were more frequent in the group of patients with PT-SPA infections (26.56%) (p < 0.01). Multivariate analysis was used to identify an injury on admission (OR = 3.089; 95% CI = 1.438-6.635; p = 0.004), administration of imipenem (OR = 15.027; 95% CI = 1.778-127.021; p = 0.013), meropenem (OR = 2.618; 95% CI = 1.030-6.653; p = 0.043), ciprofloxacin (OR = 3.380; 95% CI = 1.412-8.090; p = 0.006), vancomycin (OR = 4.294; 95% CI = 1.477-12.479; p = 0.007), piperacillin-tazobactam (OR = 4.047; 95% CI = 1.395-11.742; p = 0.010) as independent risk factors associated with PT-RPA infection. CONCLUSION: In hospitalized patients, the risk of PT-RPA infections is associated with previous administration of imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and the presence of injury on admission.
