Bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are triggers of defence responses in plants, and induce local as well as systemic acquired resistance. Arabidopsis thaliana plants pretreated with LPS show an increased resistance to the virulent bacterial plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000. To investigate the mobilization and transport of LPS in Arabidopsis leaves, fluorescently labelled LPS (Alexa Fluor(R) 488 conjugate) from Salmonella minnesota was used. Leaves were pressure infiltrated with fluorescein-labelled LPS and fluorescence microscopy was used to follow the movement and localization of LPS as a function of time. The observation of leaves 1 h after supplementation with fluorescein-labelled LPS revealed a fluorescent signal in the intercellular space. Capillary zone electrophoresis was used for the detection and analysis of the labelled LPS in directly treated leaves and systemic leaves. In addition, gel electrophoresis was used to confirm LPS mobilization. The results indicated that LPS mobilization/translocation occurs through the xylem from local, treated leaves to systemic, untreated leaves. Consequently, care should be taken when ascribing the observed biochemical responses and induced resistance from LPS perception as being uniquely local or systemic, as these responses might overlap because of the mobility of LPS in the plant vascular system.
