Lipopolysaccharide (LPS, endotoxin) is the major component of Gram-negative bacterial outer surface membrane. LPS released from bacteria into bloodstream during infection may cause serious unwanted stimulation of host's immune system and lead to septic shock of the patient. Recently, we have developed a strategy to increase salt resistance and LPS neutralization of short antimicrobial peptides by adding beta-naphthylalanine end-tags to their termini. Herein, correlations between membrane immersion depth, orientation, and antiendotoxin activities of the antimicrobial peptides S1 and S1-Nal-Nal have been investigated via solution structure, paramagnetic resonance enhancement, and saturation transfer difference NMR studies. Unlike the parent peptide S1, S1-Nal-Nal rotated its two terminal beta-naphthylalanine residues into the hydrophobic lipid A motif of LPS micelles. The LPS-induced inflammation may then be prohibited by the blocked lipid A motif.
