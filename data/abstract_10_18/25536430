Introduction. Our objective was to determine the trend of the antimicrobial susceptibility of the most common bacterial pathogens isolated in La Mancha Centro Hospital (MCH) between 2010-2012. Material and methods. Isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from patients admitted to MCH were studied. These data and their antibiotic susceptibility were obtained from the database OBSERVA (BioMerieux). Results. The percentages of susceptibility for S. aureus were: 50% methicillin-resistant-S. aureus (MRSA) (higher co-resistance to erythromycin and levofloxacin), 46% erythromycin, 73% clindamycin, 45% levofloxacin, 99% rifampin and 100% cotrimoxazole, glycopeptides, linezolid and daptomycin. Increased resistance in ICU was observed (63% MRSA), with 50% of S. aureus (susceptible and methicillin-resistant strains) with vancomycin MIC values >/= 0.5 mg/L. E. coli susceptibility: 62% amoxicillin-clavulanate, 55% ciprofloxacin, 60% cotrimoxazole, 84% gentamicin and 95% fosfomycin. K. pneumoniae susceptibility: 74% amoxicillin-clavulanate, 71% ciprofloxacin, 78% cotrimoxazole, 94% gentamicin and 87% fosfomycin. The percentage of BLEE strains was 17% and 21% for E. coli and K. pneumoniae, respectively, without detection of resistance to carbapenems. P. aeruginosa susceptibility: 80% ceftazidime and carbapenems, 63% ciprofloxacin and higher than 90% aminoglycosides. A decreasing trend of susceptibility to ceftazidime and carbapenems was observed in ICU and increasing trend to ciprofloxacin. Conclusions. Resistance percentages were higher in ICU than in the rest of the hospital, highlighting 63% of MRSA strains. Our percentage of BLEE and MRSA strains were higher than the Spanish media. Rifampicin and cotrimoxazole maintain good susceptibility to S. aureus, fosfomycin and aminoglycosides to Enterobacteriaceae and carbapenems to P. aeruginosa.
