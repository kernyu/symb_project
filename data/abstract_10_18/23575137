Bacillus anthracis Sterne strain spores were analyzed for their resistance against five disinfectants: commercial sodium hypochlorite, Spor-Klenz Ready-to-Use Cold Sterilant, accelerated hydrogen peroxide (AHP), Virkon, and surface decontamination foam (SDF). The aim of this study was to find an effective disinfectant that would reduce the viability of B. anthracis Sterne spores at >/=6 log in the presence of variables such as animal grease and fat, stainless steel, and temperature (room temperature and 4 degrees C). SDF and 10% sodium hypochlorite consistently reduced the growth of viable B. anthracis Sterne spores after 5 min in the presence of stainless steel at room temperature. It took at least 10 min of contact time for AHP to consistently reduce spore growth by >/=6 log, while it took at least 20 min for 5% bleach and Spor-Klenz to consistently inactivate >/=6 log spores in the presence of stainless steel at room temperature. AHP was the only disinfectant that reduced the viability of B. anthracis Sterne spores at >/=6 log in the presence of stainless steel and animal grease, both at room temperature and 4 degrees C after 24 h of contact time.
