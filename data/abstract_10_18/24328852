Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii isolates were obtained from 50 patients between July 2011 and July 2012 at the University Hospital A Coruna (NW Spain). These multidrug-resistant isolates, which belonged to a single clone, remained only susceptible to tigecycline, minocycline, and colistin and produced the carbapenem-hydrolyzing oxacillinase, OXA-23. This is the first reported outbreak of OXA-23-producing A. baumannii isolates in Spain.
