We evaluated the susceptibility profile of a colonizing carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae to predict its susceptibility when recovered from a clinical specimen. An overall agreement of 88.7% (517 out of 583; 95% confidence interval, 85.8%-91.0%) was observed for the combinations of 11 antibiotics with 53 pairs of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing K pneumoniae (the only carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae detected). Very major errors were observed mainly for aminoglycoside agents and colistin, limiting the predictability of the susceptibility profile for these clinical isolates.
