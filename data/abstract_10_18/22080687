There have been many recent reports of increasing antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens. In this study, we reviewed medical records of children (<18 yr age) with first acute pyelonephritis admitted to our Institution between January 2005 to December 2009. 411 children (189 girls) were studied and increasing trend in bacterial resistance toward co-trimoxazole, 2nd and 3rd generation cephalosporins and gentamicin were observed.
