OBJECTIVES: Tigecycline is one of the most important antimicrobial agents used to treat infection with multidrug-resistant bacteria. However, tigecycline-resistant pathogens have increased recently. This study was conducted to identify the antimicrobial susceptibility profile and to investigate the role of efflux pumps in high-level tigecycline-resistant Enterobacter isolates causing bacteremia. METHODS: A total of 323 Enterobacter species causing bacteremia were collected from eight hospitals in various regions of Korea. In the antimicrobial susceptibility tests, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by using the broth microdilution and an E-test method. Expression levels of efflux pump gene (acrA) and their regulators (ramA and rarA) were examined by real-time PCR. Isolate relatedness was determined by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). RESULTS: Among the 323 clinical isolates included in this study, 37 (11.5%) were non-susceptible to tigecycline. Of these, 8 isolates were highly resistant to tigecycline, with an MIC of 8mg/L (4 isolates) or 16mg/L (4 isolates). All high-level tigecycline-resistant isolates showed increased acrA (6.8- to 13.3-fold) and ramA (1.4- to 8.2-fold) expression. The isolates with a tigecycline MIC of 16mg/L also showed overexpression of rarA compared with tigecycline-susceptible isolates. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, overexpression of acrA, ramA, and rarA was observed in high-level tigecycline-resistant Enterobacter species. We suggest that rarA might be involved in the regulation of acrA overexpression in high-level tigecycline-resistant Enterobacter species. Efflux pump-mediated resistance should be closely monitored because it could be indirectly attributed to the use of other antibiotics transported by the same efflux pump.
