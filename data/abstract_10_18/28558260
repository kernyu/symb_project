Some studies evaluated the resistance profile of the Y. enterocolitica strains isolated in diverse countries. However, in Brazil the isolation and the study of Y. enterocolitica are not common and therefore information about the antimicrobial resistance profile of this species in this country is scarce. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial resistance of Y. enterocolitica of biotypes 1A, 2 and 4 isolated from clinical and non-clinical sources between 1979 and 2012, in Brazil. This study showed that some Yersinia enterocolitica of different biotypes remain susceptible to antimicrobials used for gastroenteritis treatment. Moreover, neither acquired resistance genes nor diversity of plasmids replicons were found; however, variation in the in vitro intrinsic resistant pattern was detected, except the non-resistance to cefoxitin in all strains. Notwithstanding, due to epidemiological link between Y. enterocolitica and the pork production chain, monitoring plasmid acquired resistance in Y. enterocolitica could also be considered for antimicrobial resistance control purposes and food safety measures.
