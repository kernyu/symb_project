We report retrospective analysis of the clinical and antimicrobial susceptibility data of 140 Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae isolates. Strains were isolated mostly from respiratory tract samples from patients with underlying diseases. In the case of infection, pneumonia, mainly aspiration pneumonia, was the most frequent (27.1% of the patients). We documented high rates of decreased susceptibilities and resistance to erythromycin and tetracycline (57% and 43% of the isolates, respectively), as well as reduced susceptibility to penicillin in 21% of the isolates.
