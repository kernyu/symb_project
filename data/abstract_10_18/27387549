BACKGROUND: To determine the impact of the introduction of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) on parasite susceptibility, a molecular surveillance for antimalarial drug resistance was conducted on local isolates from the Hopital Principal de Dakar between November 2013 and January 2014 and between August 2014 and December 2014. METHODS: The prevalence of genetic polymorphisms in antimalarial resistance genes (pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr and pfdhps) was evaluated in 103 isolates. RESULTS: The chloroquine-resistant haplotypes CVIET and CVMET were identified in 31.4 and 3.9 % of the isolates, respectively. The frequency of the pfcrt K76T mutation was increased from 29.3 % in 2013-2014 to 43.2 % in 2014. The pfmdr1 N86Y and Y184F mutations were identified in 6.1 and 53.5 % of the isolates, respectively. The pfdhfr triple mutant (S108N, N51I and C59R) was detected in the majority of the isolates (82.3 %). The prevalence of quadruple mutants (pfdhfr S108N, N51I, C59R and pfdhps A437G) was 40.4 %. One isolate (1.1 %) harboured the pfdhps mutations A437G and K540E and the pfdhfr mutations S108N, N51I and C59R. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a decline in the prevalence of chloroquine resistance due to the official withdrawal of the drug and to the introduction of ACT, the spread of resistance to chloroquine has continued. Furthermore, susceptibility to amodiaquine may be decreased as a result of cross-resistance. The frequency of the pfmdr1 mutation N86Y declined while the Y184F mutation increased in prevalence, suggesting that selective pressure is acting on pfmdr1, leading to a high prevalence of mutations in these isolates and the lack of specific mutations. The 50.5 % prevalence of the pfmdr1 polymorphisms N86Y and Y184F suggests a decrease in lumefantrine susceptibility. Based on these results, intensive surveillance of ACT partner drugs must be conducted regularly in Senegal.
