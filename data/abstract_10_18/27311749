OBJECTIVES: We describe the first published cluster of extensively drug resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the UK and show how early whole genome sequencing (WGS) of Mtb can assist in case management and contact investigations. METHODS: We describe the contact tracing investigation undertaken after the presentation of an adult with XDR-TB. Active cases were treated with an XDR-TB drug regimen and contacts underwent a programme of follow-up for 2 years. All isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) were assessed early using whole genome sequencing (WGS) as well as routine drug susceptibility testing (DST). RESULTS: Thirty-three contacts were screened. In the first year one confirmed and one probable case were identified through contact tracing. A further possible case was identified through epidemiological links. Two confirmed cases were identified through WGS 2 years later. Twenty-five (80%) contacts without evidence of tuberculosis were adherent to 1 year of follow-up and 14 (45%) were adherent to 2 years of follow-up. WGS of Mtb was used to guide drug choices, rapidly identify transmission events, and alter public health management. CONCLUSION: WGS of Mtb enabled rapid effective individualized treatment and facilitated public health interventions by early identification of transmission events.
