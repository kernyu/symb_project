A number of multiresistant bacterial pathogens inactivate antibiotics by producing Zn(II)-dependent beta-lactamases. We show that metal uptake leading to an active dinuclear enzyme in the periplasmic space of Gram-negative bacteria is ensured by a cysteine residue, an unusual metal ligand in oxidizing environments. Kinetic, structural and affinity data show that such Zn(II)-cysteine interaction is an adaptive trait that tunes the metal binding affinity, thus enabling antibiotic resistance at restrictive Zn(II) concentrations.
