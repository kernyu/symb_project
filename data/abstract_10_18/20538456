An analysis of the binding motifs of known HIV-1 non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors has led to discovery of novel piperidine-linked aminopyrimidine derivatives with broad activity against wild-type as well as drug-resistant mutant viruses. Notably, the series retains potency against the K103N/Y181C and Y188L mutants, among others. Thus, the N-benzyl compound 5k has a particularly attractive profile. Synthesis and SAR are presented and discussed, as well as crystal structures relating to the binding motifs.
