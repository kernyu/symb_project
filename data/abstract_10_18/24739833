CONTEXT: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common nosocomial infections, caused by Escherichia coli. This study determined the presence of virulence factors in the organism and correlates it with the multi-drug resistance (MDR). AIMS: The aim of the following study is to assess the virulence factors of uropathogenic E. coli and antibiotic susceptibility pattern. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This was a prospective study conducted in the Department of Microbiology in PT. B. D. Sharma, PGIMS, Rohtak. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study was conducted over a period of 1 year. Urine samples received were processed as per standard microbiological procedures. Virulence factors such as hemolysin, hemagglutination, cell surface hydrophobicity, serum resistance, gelatinase and siderophore production were studied. The antimicrobial susceptibility was done as per Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute Guidelines. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: The data was analyzed by using SPSS(Statistical Package for the social sciences) IBM Corporation version 17.0. A two sided P </= 0.05 was considered to be significant. RESULTS: Hemolysin production was seen in 47.4%, hemagglutination in 74.8%, cell surface hydrophobicity in 61%, serum resistance in 59%, gelatinase in 67.5% and siderophore production in 88% isolates. Nitrofurantoin was found to be most effective followed by, gatifloxacin and gentamicin. Twenty nine percent (29.62%) isolates were MDR. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, the knowledge of virulence factors of E. coli and their antibiotic susceptibility pattern will help in better understanding of the organism and in the treatment of UTI.
