BACKGROUND: The emergence of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) is a major concern in the India. The burden of XDR-TB is increasing due to inadequate monitoring, lack of proper diagnosis, and treatment. The GenoType (R) Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug resistance second line (MTBDRsl) assay is a novel line probe assay used for the rapid detection of mutational patterns conferring resistance to XDR-TB. AIM: The aim of this study was to study the rapid detection of drug resistance and mutational patterns of the XDR-TB by a novel GenoType (R) MTBDRsl assay. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 98 multidrug-resistant (MDR) M. tuberculosis isolates for second line drugs susceptibility testing by 1% proportion method (BacT/ALERT 3D system) and GenoType (R) MTBDRsl assay for rapid detection of conferring drug resistance to XDR-TB. RESULTS: A total of seven (17.4%) were identified as XDR-TB by using standard phenotypic method. The concordance between phenotypic and GenoType (R) MTBDRsl assay was 91.7-100% for different antibiotics. The sensitivity and specificity of the MTBDRsl assay were 100% and 100% for aminoglycosides; 100% and 100% for fluoroquinolones; 91.7% and 100% for ethambutol. The most frequent mutations and patterns were gyrA MUT1 (A90V) in seven (41.2%) and gyrA + WT1-3 + MUT1 in four (23.5%); rrs MUT1 (A1401G) in 11 (64.7%), and rrs WT1-2 + MUT1 in eight (47.1%); and embB MUT1B (M306V) in 11 (64.7%) strains. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the GenoType (R) MTBDRsl assay is rapid, novel test for detection of resistance to second line anti-tubercular drugs. This assay provides additional information about the frequency and mutational patterns responsible for XDR-TB resistance.
