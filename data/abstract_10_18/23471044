Recently, there has been a growing interest to replace antibiotics' administration with the application of probiotics. The aim of our investigations was to reveal the influence of spent culture supernatant of Lactobacillus plantarum 2142 on the response of enterocytes to oxidative stress, and the spent culture supernatant's ability to protect them from oxidative injury. The experiments were performed on non-carcinogenic porcine epithelial cell line, IPEC-J2 isolated from a neonatal piglet and on human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, Caco-2. The cells cultured on membrane inserts were treated with millimolar hydrogen peroxide solution to provoke oxidative stress. The peroxide-triggered cell response profile was evaluated via determination of change in transepithelial electrical resistance, quantification of extent of cell death by 4',6-diamidino-2 phenylindole (DAPI) staining and via estimation of proinflammatory cytokine, IL-8 production using ELISA technique. Non-starter lactobacilli supernatant-mediated inhibition of peroxide-triggered upregulation of IL-8 production confirmed the antiinflammatory properties of active metabolites produced by Lactobacillus plantarum 2142 in acute oxidative stress.
