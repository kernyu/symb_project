OBJECTIVES: Leukaemia initiating cells reside within specialised niches in the bone marrow where they undergo complex interactions with different stromal cell types. The bone marrow niche is characterised by a low oxygen content resulting in high expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha in leukaemic cells conferring a negative prognosis to patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). METHODS AND RESULTS: In the current study, we investigated the impact of hypoxic vs. normoxic conditions on the sensitivity of AML cell lines and primary AML blasts to cytarabine. AML cells cultured under 6% oxygen were significantly more resistant against cytarabine compared to cells cultured under normoxic conditions in proliferation and colony-formation assays. Interestingly upon cultivation under hypoxia, the expression of the cytarabine-activating enzyme deoxycytidine kinase was downregulated in all analysed AML cell lines and primary AML samples representing a possible mechanism for resistance to chemotherapy. Furthermore, the downregulation of deoxycytidine kinase could be associated with hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha as treatment with its inhibitor BAY87-2243 hampered the downregulation of deoxycytidine kinase expression under hypoxic conditions. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our data reveal that hypoxia-induced downregulation of deoxycytidine kinase represents one stroma-cell-independent mechanism of drug resistance to cytarabine in acute myeloid leukaemia.
