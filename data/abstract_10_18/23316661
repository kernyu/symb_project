Autoimmune bullous skin disorders are characterized by a severe and potentially lethal course and may require aggressive long-term treatment with systemic corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive drugs, which can lead to serious adverse events. Recently, anti-CD20 antibody, Rituximab, was reported to be beneficial as an adjuvant therapy in these diseases. Herein, we present 2 case reports of patients suffering from resistant rare diseases from the aforementioned spectrum: linear IgA dermatosis and Pemphigoid gestationis. The patients were successfully treated with Rituximab (Mabthera). This is one of the first reports of this kind of treatment for these rare life-threatening diseases. These case reports emphasize the role of Rituximab as a crisis therapy in autoimmune blistering diseases.
