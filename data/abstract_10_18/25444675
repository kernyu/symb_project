We report a case of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobactor baumannii isolates obtained from a traveler returned from Brunei. Whole-genome sequencing analysis revealed that the isolates harbored blaOxA-23 and armA. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics against the strain were as follows: imipenem, 32 mug/ml; meropenem, 32 mug/ml; ciprofloxacin, 16 mug/ml; amikacin, >== 1024 mug/ml; arbekacin, >== 1024 mug/ml; aztreonam, 64 mug/ml; colistin, 4 mug/ml. A. baumannii harboring both blaOxA-23 and armA is rarely reported in Japan, and, to the best of our knowledge, this is the second report of A. baumannii harboring both resistant genes in Japan.
