Recent advances in the treatment of multiple myeloma have resulted in improved response rates and overall survival in patients with multiple myeloma. These advances are largely due to thalidomide-, lenalidomide-, and bortezomib-based combinations that have improved response rates, not only in patients with untreated disease, but also in those with relapsed and/or refractory myeloma, in some cases producing response rates up to 85%. Eventually, however, nearly all patients relapse, emphasizing a continuing role for the introduction of investigational agents that overcome drug resistance. This article will review the current role for thalidomide, lenalidomide, and bortezomib-based combinations, as well as some preliminary findings for promising investigational agents currently in clinical trials for patients with relapsed and/or refractory disease.
