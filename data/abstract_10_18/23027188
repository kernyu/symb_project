Two novel isolates of Candida glabrata exhibiting reduced sensitivity to amphotericin B (MIC, 8 mug ml(-1)) were found to be ERG2 mutants, wherein Delta(8)-sterol intermediates comprised >90% of the total cellular sterol fraction. Both harbored an alteration at Thr(121) in ERG2; the corresponding residue (Thr(119)) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is essential for sterol Delta8-Delta7 isomerization. This constitutes the first report of C. glabrata harboring mutations in ERG2 and exhibiting reduced sensitivity to amphotericin B.
