INTRODUCTION: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals are at a higher risk of developing metabolic disturbances. The pathogenesis of these complications is complex and not fully explored. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of HIV infection and antiretroviral (ARV) therapy on the development of metabolic changes and adipocytokine concentrations. The analysis of the differences in the investigated parameters among lipodystrophic and nonlipodystrophic patients was also performed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 42 HIVinfected patients on ARV therapy (HIV[+]ARV[+]), 13 HIVinfected ARV naive patients (HIV[+]ARV[-]), and 20 healthy controls were included in the study. A lipid profile, fasting free fatty acids (FFAs), glucose, insulin, and insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance--HOMAIR) were tested. Serum concentrations of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), interleukin 6 (IL6), adiponectin, leptin, and fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) were determined. RESULTS: Increased FFA levels were observed in HIV(+)ARV(-) patients. HIV(+)ARV(+) patients had significantly higher triglycerides and insulin level compared with controls. HOMAIR showed a tendency to be higher in HIV(+)ARV(+) patients compared with the other study groups. The ARV therapy longer than 2 years resulted in more pronounced metabolic abnormalities. HIV infection itself had a significant effect on inflammation expressed by elevated TNFalpha and IL6 levels. We did not observe differences in adiponectin and FABP4 concentrations among the study groups, while the leptin concentration was significantly lower in HIVinfected lipodystrophic than in nonlipodystrophic patients. CONCLUSIONS: HIV infection induces lipid disorders, especially associated with fatty acid turnover augmented by ARV therapy. Compared with FABP4, leptin is a better biological marker of metabolic complications in HIVinfected patients.
