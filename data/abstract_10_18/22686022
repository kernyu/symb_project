A number of bifunctional vector structures (pTpE, pTpE5, pTpH2, pTpH7, pTpS1) with molecular dimension of 11.3 kb has been created. Vector plasmids can be replicated, sustainably maintained and expressed both in Gram-negative (Escherichia coli XL1 Blue) and in Gram-positive (Streptomyces levoris 165) cultures. The given bifunctional vectors contain genes of resistance to 3 antibiotics. Genes of resistance to ampicillin and canamycin are expressed in E. coli cells, gene of resistance to thiostrepton ensures the resistance of streptomycete cells to the given antibiotic. It is proved that all the studied plasmids contain active egfp-gene which allows the visual study in vivo of the functioning of the poducts ofpEGFP-C1 gene cloned to polylinker.
