In 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) recommended initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) for youth with HIV at higher CD4 counts (</=500 cells/mm(3)) than previously recommended (</=350 cells/mm(3)). Barriers experienced by providers regarding ART initiation in this population have not been assessed. From 12/2011-01/2012, we asked providers from the American Academy of HIV Medicine (AAHIVM) [corrected] listserv who prescribed ART to youth (ages 13-25 years) with behaviorally-acquired HIV to complete a web-based survey. We presented a clinical vignette to explore potential barriers for initiating ART. Overall, 274/290 (94%) respondents completed the survey. Most felt confident that evidence supported initiating ART at higher CD4 counts (94%), and that benefits outweighed the risks of long-term toxicity (98%) or developing resistance (88%). Most (96%) initiated ART in the patient vignette (age 19 years, CD4 count ~400). Patient characteristics (e.g., unstable housing or drug use) were perceived as large barriers to ART initiation. Low response rate (13%) was a limitation. Respondents were knowledgeable about relevant DHHS guidelines, believed sufficient evidence supported ART initiation at higher CD4 counts, and would provide treatment to those with CD4 counts </=500cells/mm(3). Understanding and overcoming barriers to initiation of ART perceived by providers is important to ensure implementation of ART treatment guidelines.
