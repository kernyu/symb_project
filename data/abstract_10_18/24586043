UV RESISTANCE LOCUS8 (UVR8) signaling involves CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1, the ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) transcription factor, and the closely related HY5 HOMOLOG. Some UV-B responses mediated by UVR8 are also regulated by nitric oxide (NO), a bioactive molecule that orchestrates a wide range of processes in plants. In this study, we investigated the participation of the UVR8 pathway and its interaction with NO in UV-B-induced stomatal movements in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Stomata in abaxial epidermal strips of Arabidopsis ecotype Landsberg erecta closed in response to increasing UV-B fluence rates, with maximal closure after 3-h exposure to 5.46 mumol m(-)(2) s(-)(1) UV-B. Both hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and NO increased in response to UV-B, and stomatal closure was maintained by NO up to 24 h after the beginning of exposure. Stomata of plants expressing bacterial NO dioxygenase, which prevents NO accumulation, did not close in response to UV-B, although H(2)O(2) still increased. When the uvr8-1 null mutant was exposed to UV-B, stomata remained open, irrespective of the fluence rate. Neither NO nor H(2)O(2) increased in stomata of the uvr8-1 mutant. However, the NO donor S-nitrosoglutathione induced closure of uvr8-1 stomata to the same extent as in the wild type. Experiments with mutants in UVR8 signaling components implicated CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1, HY5, and HY5 HOMOLOG in UV-B-induced stomatal closure. This research provides evidence that the UVR8 pathway regulates stomatal closure by a mechanism involving both H(2)O(2) and NO generation in response to UV-B exposure.
