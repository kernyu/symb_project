OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical features of pandrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (PDR-Ab) in the Chinese PLA General Hospital and compare the efficacies of different antibiotic treatments in aged patients with ventilator-associative pneumonia (VAP) caused by PDR-Ab. METHODS: Data were collected from all isolated PDR-Ab strains in our hospital from April 2009 to April 2010. The clinical features, treatment, and outcomes were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: PDR-Ab was found to be the dominant pathogen in 42 of 126 aged VAP patients. Cefoperazone/sulbactam plus minocycline showed good efficacy in 20 patients with PDR-Ab VAP, showing a clinical cure rate of 65% (13/20) and a bacterial eradication rate of 40% (8/20). Another 22 patients were treated with other antimicrobial drugs, achieving a clinical cure rate of 22.7% (5/22) and a bacterial eradication rate of 13.6% (3/22). The factors influencing bacterial clearance were prolonged length of hospital stay and mechanical ventilation prior to positive culture (all P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Cefoperazone/sulbactam plus minocycline can be an effective treatment for VAP caused by PDR-Ab.
