OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antibiotic resistance and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns of clinical isolates of Salmonella (S.) typhi and S. paratyphi in Henan province during 2009-2011. METHODS: According to molecular typing and Salmonella K-B drug susceptibility test method published by international PulseNet bacterial infectious disease monitoring network and USA Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), the drug susceptibility and PFGE molecule characteristics of 78 S. typhi and S. paratyphi strains isolated from sentinel hospitals in Henan were analyzed. RESULTS: The 78 strains of S. typhi and S. paratyphi were resistant to 13 kinds of antibiotics, in which 62 were multidrug resistant (79.5%), 4 were resistant to 2-3 kinds of antibiotics (5.1%), 41 were resistant to 5-8 kinds of antibiotics (52.6%), 14 were resistant to 9-10 kinds of antibiotics (17.9%), 3 were resistant to 11-12 kinds of antibiotics (3.8%). The resistant rate to cephalosporins, quinolones and other 3 kinds of antibiotic showed an increase trends. Seventy two strains of S. typhi and S. paratyphi could be divided 14 molecular patterns by digestion with Xba and PFGE, each pattern contains 1-47 strains which shared the similarity of 66.03%-100.00%. CONCLUSIONS: The drug resistance of clinical isolates of S. typhi and S. paratyphi was serious in Henan. The PFGE patterns showed diversity, but the predominant patterns could be still found. The PFGE patterns of some strains were associated with their drug resistance.
