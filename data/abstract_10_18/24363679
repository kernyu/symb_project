Because of its resistance to antibiotics, Staphylococcus aureus causes many of problems in hospital and society. As one of the main reasons of clinical infections it can cause to serious surgical and cutaneous infections and pneumonia. The inhibitory effect of the essential oils include; Eucalyptus largiflorence, E. camaldulensis, E. malliodora and E. polycarpa as a natural and herbal antimicrobial substances on Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and other antibiotic resistant series separated from clinical samples were evaluated. The minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) of the Eucalyptus essential oils was appointed by the dilution method in the tube and the results revealed that the values for the E. camaldulensis 1/256 v/v, E. largiflorence 1/512 v/v, E. malliodora 1/256 v/v and E. polycarpa 1/128 v/v were 3.9 mug/mL, 1.95 mug/mL, 3.9 mug/mL and 7.8 mug/mL, respectively. Eucalyptol is the major compound of the Eucalyptus essential oil. The MIC of the pure eucalyptol appointed by the dilution method in the tube was equal to 1.95 mug/mL. In conclusion, anti Staphylococcus activity of the Eucalyptus essential oils suggested it's clinically useful potentials, although further studies are required.
