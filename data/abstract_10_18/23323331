The development of delayed disorders caused by acute ethylene glycol poisoning has been studied in experiments on male rats. These disorders include chronic renal failure and secondary combined immunodeficiency status of the "circulus vitiosus" type. Urgent pharmacological correction was shown to be necessary shortly after the poisoning. The experimental therapy (administration of immunomodulators with various mechanisms of action in addition to conventional antidote treatment with ethanol) resulted in the restoration of nonspecific resistance and both cellular and humoral immunity. Reduction of the urinary system damage after the administration of immunomodulators was observed. The results demonstrated the importance of multiagent immunotherapy for the correction of delayed effects of acute ethylene glycol poisoning.
