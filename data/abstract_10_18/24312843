Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) cause difficulties in the management of skin and soft tissue infections and have led to morbidity and mortality in hospital-acquired infections especially in susceptible individuals, those who are generally sick or immunosuppressed. Currently approaches in antibacterial agents offer opportunities to manage the trouble using novel anti-infection systems. Therefore, nanotechnology, a most promising field for generating new applications in medicine, has introduced a most prominent nanoproduct named as nanosilver that revealed excellent antimicrobial activity against some of the hazardous infections. Also cathelicidin peptides which are a part of native immune defense system in the skin and epithelia exhibit excellent antimicrobial activity against some of these perilous infections.
