PURPOSE: Resistance to carbapenems due to carbapenemases has been increasingly noticed in Enterobacteriaceae. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) has recommended the latest Carba NP (CNP) test as a confirmatory test for carbapenemase production in Enterobacteriaceae. Low sensitivity of disk diffusion (DD) and modified Hodge test (MHT) may result in missing out of resistant strains which can adversely affect clinical management. The present study compares three phenotypic tests - CNP test, DD, and MHT for detection of carbapenemase production. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four hundred consecutive, nonduplicate Enterobacteriaceae isolates were tested for carbapenem resistance using ertapenem disc (10 mug) by Kirby-Bauer DD method, MHT, and CNP. These tests were performed and interpreted as per the CLSI standards. CNP was considered to be the reference test for comparison. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy rates for ertapenem DD and MHT were calculated. RESULTS: One hundred and six out of 400 strains were positive by CNP test. Of the 294 CNP-negative strains, 28 were resistant by DD and 18 were resistant by MHT. Of the 106 CNP-positive strains, 82 were resistant and 16 were intermediate by DD while 76 were positive by MHT ertapenem DD had a sensitivity and specificity of 66.04% and 90.48%, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of MHT were 54.72% and 93.88%, respectively. There was considerable discordance between all the three tests. CONCLUSION: As a rapid, simple, and cost-effective test with a greater capability greater to detect carbapenemase producers, CNP can be implemented in routine diagnostic laboratories, thereby benefiting patient care and antimicrobial stewardship.
