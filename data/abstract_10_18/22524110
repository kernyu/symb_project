HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection is today a very important health issue worldwide, which demands new ways and strategies for its prevention and treatment. Several studies on the innate immunity against HIV infection have shown that antimicrobial peptides are associated with increased resistance to infection. In the present review, we briefly summarize the major characteristics of antimicrobial peptides from human and several species of plants, amphibians, insects and other animal species that have significant potential to be used as therapeutic or prophylactic agents. The mechanisms of infection inhibition and viral replication blockade are also described in the context of the biology of infection.
