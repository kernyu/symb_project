Approximately 1.5% of hospital patients develop hospital acquired pneumonia. Aspiration is the major risk factor for pneumonia and is associated with reduced ability to mechanically clear respiratory pathogens into the stomach. Currently non-invasive methods of diagnosing hospital acquired pneumonia are less robust than invasive methods, and lead to over-diagnosis. Accurate diagnosis is key to surveillance, prevention and treatment of HAP, and also to improving outcomes; newer imaging modalities such as phase contrast X-ray imaging and nanoparticle enhanced magnetic resonance imaging may help. Potential preventative strategies such as systematic swallowing assessment in non-stroke patients, and interventions such as improving oral hygiene need further, robust randomised controlled trials. Antibiotics are likely to continue to be the mainstay of treatment, and new antibiotics such as ceftobiprole are likely to have a role in treating hospital acquired pneumonia. Given the spread of antimicrobial resistance, alternative treatment strategies including bacteriophages, peptides and antibodies are under investigation. Reducing the incidence of hospital acquired pneumonia could decrease length of hospital stay, reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, and both improve functional outcomes and mortality in our increasingly aged population.
