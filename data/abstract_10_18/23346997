AIM: Few cases of primary entecavir resistance in chronic hepatitis B patients have been reported to date. The serial profiling of the HBV polymerase gene mutations from a treatment-naive patient who developed drug resistance after 32 months of entecavir therapy is presented here. DESIGN: Serum samples were collected at multiple time points from before the start of therapy to virological and biochemical breakthrough. The evolution of the hepatitis B virus polymerase gene mutations was analysed with commercial line probe assay and pyrosequencing. RESULTS: Drug resistance mutation analysis by pyrosequencing revealed a two-step process in the selection of drug resistance. The patient had a good initial response to entecavir 0.5 mg/day. A partially resistant HBV strain first emerged as the predominant species from as early as 2 weeks. After a period of non-compliance to therapy, there was virological breakthrough, which resolved on restarting entecavir. Shortly after, there was secondary failure of entecavir therapy, caused by a new resistant strain carrying all three mutations required. CONCLUSION: In this patient, pre-existence of minor population of partially resistant viral strains and treatment non-compliance probably contributed to his development of primary entecavir resistance.
