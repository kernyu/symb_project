OBJECTIVE: To review the type and number of pathogens and their antibiotic sensitivity in patients with late infected total joint replacement so as to offer guidance for the choice of antibiotics. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted for 62 patients whose suspected specimens were obtained intra-operatively during a total hip arthroplasty since January 2002 to August 2010 at our department. Their demographic data, bacterial species and antibiotic sensitivity profiles were recorded. RESULTS: Among 62 cases, the cultures were tested positive in 48 cases; the most common bacteria was Gram-positive bacteria (74%). And coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 62.9% of all bacterial cultures. And the ratio of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus was 41.18%. CONCLUSION: The late infection of total hip arthroplasty is mainly caused by Gram-positive bacteria. Antibiotic treatment for late periprosthetic infection should be guided by the findings of drug susceptibility. Vancomycin may be used as a primary agent for the treatment of infected hip arthroplasty.
