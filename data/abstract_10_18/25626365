Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen whose responses to environmental changes are associated with the virulence attributes. Edc3 is known to be an enhancer of the mRNA decapping reactions and a scaffold protein of cytoplasmic processing bodies (P-bodies). Recent studies of C. albicans Edc3 suggested its critical roles in filamentous growth and stress-induced apoptotic cell death. The edc3/edc3 deletion mutant strain showed increased cell survival and less ROS accumulation upon treatment with hydrogen peroxide. To investigate the diverse involvement of Edc3 in the cellular processes, deletion mutations of LSm, FDF, or YjeF domain of Edc3 were constructed. The edc3-LSmDelta or edc3-YjeFDelta mutation showed the filamentation defect, resistance to oxidative stress, and decreased ROS accumulation. In contrast, the edc3-FDFDelta mutation exhibited a wild-type level of filamentous growth and a mild defect in ROS accumulation. These results suggest that Lsm and YjeF domains of Edc3 are critical in hyphal growth and oxidative stress response.
