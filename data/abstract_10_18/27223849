In this study, we evaluated the insulin-sensitizing effect of flavans purified from Broussonetia kazinoki Siebold (BK) on 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Among the tested compounds, kazinol B enhanced intracellular lipid accumulation, gene expression of proliferator-activated receptorgamma (PPARgamma) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-alpha (C/EBPalpha), and consistently induced PPARgamma transcriptional activation. To further investigate the insulin-sensitizing effect of kazinol B, we measured glucose analogue uptake by fully differentiated adipocytes and myotubes. Kazinol B increased 2-[N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]-2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-NBDG) uptake by cells by upregulating the gene expression and translocation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT-4) into the plasma membrane in adipocytes. Kazinol B stimulated the gene expression and secretion of adiponectin, which is associated with a low risk of types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus. We also suggested the mechanism of the antidiabetic effect of kazinol B by assaying Akt and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation. In conclusion, kazinol B isolated from BK improved insulin sensitivity by enhancing glucose uptake via the insulin-Akt signaling pathway and AMPK activation. These results suggest that kazinol B might be a therapeutic candidate for diabetes mellitus.
