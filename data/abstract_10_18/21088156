Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a leading cause of nosocomial infections that result in extended hospital stays and increased mortality. Therefore, rapid, cost-effective techniques for surveillance and detection of MRSA are critical to the containment and prevention of the spread of MRSA within the health care environment. We examined the ability of 3 chromogenic media (Spectra MRSA, Remel, Lenexa, KS; MRSA Select, Bio-Rad, Redmond, WA; and ChromID MRSA, bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) to detect MRSA from routine surveillance specimens following 18, 24, and 48 hours of incubation. Our results indicate that detection of MRSA using all 3 chromogenic media is optimal following 24 hours of incubation. Early examination reduced sensitivity, while extended incubation reduced specificity. In addition, Spectra MRSA identified 2 borderline oxacillin-resistant strains of S aureus that were not detected by the other 2 chromogenic agars evaluated. These strains demonstrate increased basal and inducible resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics.
