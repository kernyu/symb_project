The interferon-induced oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) family is one of the most important immune response proteins to the viral infection. The OAS protein binds dsRNA and is activated to produce 2',5'-oligoadenylates, which lead to the activation of latent form of RNase L, resulting in degradation of cellular and viral RNA and inhibition of viral replication. In mice, the Oas gene family locates on chromosome 5. The mouse Oas gene locus undergoes a recent series of duplication event, leading to the presence of eight paralogs of Oas1 genes (Oas1a through Oas1h) that forms Oas gene cluster with the Oas2, Oas3 and two OasL (OasL1 and OasL2) genes. Previous studies demonstrated that the mouse Oas1b gene conferred resistance to the flavivirus infection in mice; however, the antiviral activity of other mouse Oas1 gene family is still unknown. Therefore, in the present study, we have evaluated the mouse Oas1 paralogs regarding the enzymatic activity and antiviral activity against the two neurotropic flaviviruses, West Nile virus and tick-borne encephalitis virus. The mouse Oas1 genes were cloned from C57BL/6J (B6) as well as the Oas1b derived from feral mouse strain, MSM. The obtained results demonstrated that only Oas1a and Oas1g showed enzymatic activity. Although MSM-derived Oas1b showed antiviral activity to both viruses, all B6-derived OAS paralogs did not show antiviral activity. These results suggest that Oas1a and Oas1g play a role in potentiating viral RNA-induced interferon response in the cell, whereas the Oas1b works as a specific anti-flavivirus factor unless it is mutated. However, the role of other paralogs is unknown and should wait for further investigation.
