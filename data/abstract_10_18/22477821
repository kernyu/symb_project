Inactivation of beta-lactams by the action of beta-lactamase enzymes is the most common mode of resistance to these drugs among Gram-negative organisms. The genomes of some key clinical pathogens such as Enterobacter and Pseudomonas encode AmpC, an inducible chromosomal beta-lactamase. The potent activity of AmpC against broad-spectrum beta-lactams complicates treatment of organisms with this gene. Antibiotic exposure can select for mutants expressing high levels of this enzyme, leading to the emergence of resistant isolates and failure of therapy, even when the initial isolate is fully susceptible. The risk of selecting for resistant organisms varies according to the particular beta-lactam used for treatment. This article reviews the microbiology of these enzymes, summarizes clinical data on the frequency emergence of resistance, and discusses considerations for antimicrobial treatment of these organisms.
