The verification of refined variants of already existing medicines proved to be a breakthrough for antibiotic research. However, resistance to old and newer antibiotics among microbacillary pathogens is evolving quickly. Drug-resistant pathogens have become an important economic burden for patients. This invention (WO2010080819) provides novel targeting moieties (peptides) that specifically/preferentially bind to microorganisms. The targeting moieties can be attached to effectors to form chimeric constructs for specifically/preferentially delivering the effector to and/or into the target organism. In certain embodiments, novel antimicrobial peptides that can be used to inhibit of certain microorganisms are provided.
