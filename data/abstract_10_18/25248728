In this particular study, the antibacterial activity of esculin and oligomer fractions was assessed. MIC values of esculin and its oligomer fractions as well as of some antibiotics against Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains and against Escherichia coli multiresistant variants were determined by the standard broth microdilution method. Both esculin and oligoesculin fractions exhibited antibacterial effect against reference strains; Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enteritidis and Salmonella typhimurium. It appears that E3 oligomer fraction had the greatest antibacterial activity against these reference strains. Besides, as E2 and E3 revealed the best antibacterial effect against multiresistant variants of E. coli, we decided to test the effect of each, combined to the antibiotic against which the variants were resistant. In the interaction study, E2 and E3 oligoesculin fractions were found to be effective in reducing the resistance of E. coli 6574 to ofloxacin and the resistance of E. coli 6228 to amoxicillin. Only E3 oligoesculin fraction showed a synergetic interaction with amoxicillin and tetracyclin against E. coli 6708, but no interaction was found either with E2 or E3 fractions against E. coli 6234. Our study allowed us to conclude that oligomerization of esculin increases its antibacterial potential, according to the degree of polymerization.
