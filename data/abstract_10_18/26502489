Improvements in the optimal use of antibiotics is the cornerstone of the French national point-of-care alert for antibiotics (2011-2016). Integrated electronic medical records for antibiotic prescriptions have been deployed in the Montpellier University Hospital (2,800 beds) since 2012. The present paper proposes an overview of integrated electronic medical records for antibiotic prescriptions and how telecounselling at the Montpellier Hospital fits with the global anti-infection ICT strategy. This management change is fully traceable. A review of the results of the project has lead to an improvement in patient care via a collaboration between IDS and other hospital members. This project is part of the Region Reference site of the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing (MACVIA-LR).
