OBJECTIVE: To determine the duration of protection conferred by the hepatitis B (HB) vaccination and the necessity of a booster dose. METHODS: Immediately after the initial blood sampling, 252 youths (aged 18.8-20.5 years, 52% females) with a history of neonatal HB vaccination with one dose of the HB vaccine received a booster. Serum concentrations of antibodies against the HB surface antigen were assessed in samples collected before and 10-14 days after the booster. Seroconversion from concentrations <10 to >/=10 IU/L were defined as a positive immune response. RESULTS: Of the 252 participants, 131 were sero-susceptible and 114 responded. CONCLUSION: Nearly 90% of young people preserved their long-term protection; the results of this study do not support the use of an HB booster vaccination.
