This work presented a highly efficient antibacterial Ti-surface which was grafted with poly(N-hydroxyethylacrylamide) (PHEAA) brush and further decorated with triclosan (TCS). The modified surfaces were characterized using contact angle measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared. The antibacterial performance of the modified surfaces was evaluated using the Streptococcus mutans and Actinomyces naeslundii attachment test. The Ti surface with PHEAA brush (Ti-PHEAA) was able to resist the adhesion of the bacteria, while the TCS-decorated Ti surface (Ti-TCS) showed the capability of killing the bacteria adhered on the surface. As we coupled the TCS to the PHEAA brush, the surface showed highly efficient antibacterial performance due to the combination of the resistance to the bacteria adhesion and its activity of killing bacteria.
