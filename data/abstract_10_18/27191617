Lipophilic substituents at benzodioxane C (7) of 3-(benzodioxan-2-ylmethoxy)-2,6-difluorobenzamide improve the antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains to MIC values in the range of 0.2-2.5 mug/mL, whereas hydrophilic substituents at the same position and modifications at the benzodioxane substructure, excepting for replacement with 2-cromanyl, are deleterious. Some of the lead compounds also exhibit good activity against Mtb. Parallel SARs to those of 3-(2-benzothiazol-2-ylmethoxy)-2,6-difluorobenzamide, well known FtsZ inhibitor, and cells alterations typical of FtsZ inhibition indicate such a protein as the target of these potent antibacterial benzodioxane-benzamides.
