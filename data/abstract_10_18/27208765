Polymyxin resistance is a major public health threat, as the polymyxins represent "last-line" therapeutics for Gram-negative pathogens resistant to essentially all other antibiotics. Improved understanding of mechanisms of, and risk factors for, polymyxin resistance, as well as infection prevention and stewardship strategies, together with optimization of dosing of polymyxins including in combination regimens, can help to limit the emergence and dissemination of polymyxin resistance.
