AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)/p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K)1 pathway is overactivated in obesity, leading to inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signalling and insulin resistance. However, chronic mTORC1 inhibition by rapamycin impairs glucose homeostasis because of robust induction of liver gluconeogenesis. Here, we compared the effect of rapamycin with that of the selective S6K1 inhibitor, PF-4708671, on glucose metabolism in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: We used L6 myocytes and FAO hepatocytes to explore the effect of PF-4708671 on the regulation of glucose uptake, glucose production and insulin signalling. We also treated high-fat (HF)-fed obese mice for 7 days with PF-4708671 in comparison with rapamycin to assess glucose tolerance, insulin resistance and insulin signalling in vivo. RESULTS: Chronic rapamycin treatment induced insulin resistance and impaired glucose metabolism in hepatic and muscle cells. Conversely, chronic S6K1 inhibition with PF-4708671 reduced glucose production in hepatocytes and enhanced glucose uptake in myocytes. Whereas rapamycin treatment inhibited Akt phosphorylation, PF-4708671 increased Akt phosphorylation in both cell lines. These opposite effects of the mTORC1 and S6K1 inhibitors were also observed in vivo. Indeed, while rapamycin treatment induced glucose intolerance and failed to improve Akt phosphorylation in liver and muscle of HF-fed mice, PF-4708671 treatment improved glucose tolerance and increased Akt phosphorylation in metabolic tissues of these obese mice. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Chronic S6K1 inhibition by PF-4708671 improves glucose homeostasis in obese mice through enhanced Akt activation in liver and muscle. Our results suggest that specific S6K1 blockade is a valid pharmacological approach to improve glucose disposal in obese diabetic individuals.
