Echinocandins are commonly used as initial empiric therapy in cases of moderate to severe invasive candidiasis. The authors demonstrate that caution should be exercised in applying this approach in certain clinical situations. A case of Candida glabrata fungemia and associated chorioretinitis that was clinically resistant to therapy with micafungin but appeared to resolve with amphotericin B is presented. The authors then briefly review current issues regarding the diagnosis and treatment of C glabrata chorioretinitis.
