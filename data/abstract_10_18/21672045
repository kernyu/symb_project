Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are associated with high morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. Although Aspergillus spp. remain an important cause of IFI, other moulds such as Fusarium spp., dematiaceous fungi and Mucorales have become increasingly prevalent among this patient population. Diagnosis and treatment of invasive mould infections remain a challenge. Because of the poor prognosis associated with IFIs, understanding the activity, efficacy and limitations of the available drugs is critical to select the appropriate antifungal agent on an individualised basis.
