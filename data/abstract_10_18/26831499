Melioidosis is an infectious disease caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei. Melioidosis is of public health importance in endemic areas, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical areas. We describe a case of melioidosis contracted by a man with diabetes from Papua New Guinea that was evaluated using multi-locus sequence typing and whole genome sequencing.
