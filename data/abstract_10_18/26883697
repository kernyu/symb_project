Thein vitroactivities of clarithromycin and tigecycline alone and in combination againstMycobacterium aviumwere assessed. The activity of clarithromycin was time dependent, highly variable, and often resulted in clarithromycin resistance. Tigecycline showed concentration-dependent activity, and mycobacterial killing could only be achieved at high concentrations. Tigecycline enhanced clarithromycin activity againstM. aviumand prevented clarithromycin resistance. Whether there is clinical usefulness of tigecycline in the treatment ofM. aviuminfections needs further study.
