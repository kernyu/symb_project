Histidine kinase receptors (HKRs) appear to be a common strategy for model and pathogenic fungi to sense and respond to environmental stresses. In the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus, which is responsible for invasive aspergillosis, 13 genes potentially encoding HKRs have been identified. Until now, only three HKRs have been functionally characterized. The aim of this study was to perform the systematic invalidation of A. fumigatus HKR genes and the careful phenotypic characterization of the relevant mutants. This study notably allowed to gain new important insights into the role of HKRs in physiology of A. fumigatus. Actually, we showed that (i) NikA/TcsC could be involved in the cell wall integrity pathway, (ii) Fhk6 and PhkA were involved in the regulation of the "fluffy" developmental program, (iii) PhkB could participate in the regulation of conidiation and (iv) PhkA was implied in the resistance of oxidative stresses.
