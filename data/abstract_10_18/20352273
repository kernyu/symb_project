We have previously demonstrated that Yersinia ruckeri resists cecropin B in an inducible manner. In this study, we sought to identify the molecular changes responsible for the inducible cecropin B resistance of Y. ruckeri. Differences in gene expression associated with the inducible resistance were investigated. Cultures of Y. ruckeri were exposed to a sublethal concentration of cecropin B and resultant changes in the messenger RNA population of the bacteria were assayed using the differential display reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (DD-RT-PCR). A single band was consistently increased in intensity in all repeats of the experiment. The band was excised, cloned, sequenced, and used to screen a Y. ruckeri genomic DNA library. The DD-RT-PCR fragment shared 100% identity to the cDNA sequence of an ATP-dependent endonuclease of the overcome lysogenization defect (OLD) family of Y. ruckeri 29473. The genomic clone that was recovered was not identical to the DD-RT-PCR clone, but harbored a gene for a secreted endonuclease 1 (nucM) homologue. It was determined that transcription of the gene was upregulated following exposure to cecropin B via RT-PCR. Furthermore, an increase in the nuclease activity of culture supernatants of Y. ruckeri following exposure to cecropin B was demonstrated. These findings demonstrate that cecropin B exposure increases the expression of at least two endonucleases in Y. ruckeri. The production and secretion of an endonuclease by Y. ruckeri in response to an antimicrobial peptide indicates the involvement of both intracellular and extracellular DNA in the toxic effects of cecropin B.
