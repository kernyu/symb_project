OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution and drug sensitivity of pathogenic bacteria isolated from patients with nosocomial infection in intensive care unit. METHODS: The clinical data were collected from 229 hospitalized patients with nosocomial infection in intensive care unit from 2009 to 2011. RESULTS: Gram-negative bacteria were the main pathogens (68.25%) in the intensive care unit. From 2009 to 2011, the annual isolation rate of multidrug-resistant baumannii showed a significant reduction with time (39.13%, 18.18%, and 15%, respectively, P<0.05), while the prevalence of multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ESBLs-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci methicillin-resistant strains showed no significant changes in the 3 years (P>0.05). The overall sensitivity of gram-negative bacilli to the antimicrobial agents tended to increase with time. The Gram-negative bacilli remained highly sensitive to carbapenems, tigecycline, amikacin and piperacillin/tazobactam; the Gram-positive bacilli were highly sensitive to vancomycin, quinoline Nupu Ting/dalfopristin, linezolid, and tigecycline with sensitivity rates all reaching 100%. CONCLUSION: Adherence to the principles of antibiotic use and effective monitoring and preventive measures are encouraged to reduce antibiotic resistance rates of the bacteria and the incidences of hospital infection.
