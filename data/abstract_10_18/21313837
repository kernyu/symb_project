A collection of 125 Salmonella enterica poultry isolates (71 serovar Kentucky isolates, and the remainder belonging to serovars Alachua, Enteritidis, Hadar, Heidelberg, Montevideo, Mbandaka, Senftenberg, Typhimurium, and Worthington) were tested for the ability to grow on tryptic soy agar containing sodium arsenite [As(III)] or arsenate [As(V)]. All serovar Kentucky isolates and 18 of the non-Kentucky isolates were able to grow in the presence of 0.1 mM As(III), and 69 grew in the presence of 1 mM As(V). Thirty of the non-Kentucky isolates did not grow at these As(III) and As(V) concentrations, but seven grew at 1 mM As(III) and 10 mM As(V). PCR-based analysis demonstrated the presence of arsB and arsD sequences in all Kentucky isolates, whereas one or both of these sequences were present in only 30 of the other isolates. It remains to be determined if these arsenic-resistance determinants benefit Salmonella exposed to man-made arsenic-containing compounds in poultry environments.
