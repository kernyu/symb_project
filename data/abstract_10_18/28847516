S100A9 is an endogenous danger signal that promotes and exacerbates the neutrophilic inflammatory response. To investigate the role of S100A9 in neutrophilic asthma, S100A9 levels were measured in sputum from 101 steroid-naive asthmatics using an ELISA kit and the levels were significantly correlated with percentages of neutrophils in sputum. Intranasal administration of recombinant S100A9 markedly increased neutrophil numbers at 8h and 24h later with concomitant elevation of IL-1beta, IL-17, and IFN-gamma levels. Treatment with an anti-S100A9 antibody restored the increased numbers of neutrophils and the increased airway resistance in OVA/CFA mice toward the levels of sham-treated mice. Concomitantly, the S100A9 and neutrophil elastase double positive cells were markedly reduced with attenuation of IL-1beta, IL-17, and IFN-gamma levels by the treatment with the anti-S100A9 antibody. Our data support a role of S100A9 to initiate and amplify the neutrophilic inflammation in asthma, possibly via inducing IL-1beta, IL-17 and IFN-gamma.
