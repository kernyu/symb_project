More and more researches show that hypertensive vascular remodeling is closely related to the imbalance of immune system in recent years. IFN-gamma is natural protein with the function of immune regulation and has resistance effect on vascular remodeling. However, the mechanism of IFN-gamma is to be defined. This paper is to explore the mechanism of IFN-gamma in regulating OPN/Th17 pathway. In this research, animal models of vascular collagen remodeling were established by inducing hypertensive mice with ANG II. There was no statistical significance when the systolic blood pressures and the percentages of wall thickness/lumen diameter in both groups of WT + AngII + IFN-gamma and WT + PBS were compared (P=0.219>0.05, P=0.118>0.05). The concentration of serum precollagen-type I and III and their ratio in WT + AngII + IFN-gamma group were decreased after the IFN-gamma being given (P<0.01). Expression of OPN within tissue in WT + Ang II group was relatively high, but lowered after treated by IFN-gamma. Th17 cell ratio was decreased in WT + AngII + IFN-gamma group (P<0.01). Expressions of RORalpha and RORgammat mRNA within Th17 cell were decreased (P<0.01). The content of IL-23 in WT + AngII + IFN-gamma group was increased, while IL-10 and TGF-beta decreased. It has proved that IFN-gamma can regulate the hypertensive vascular collagen remodeling induced by ANG II, lower the systolic pressure and reduce the pathological damage of vascular collagen remodeling and the collagen synthesis. The mechanism may that the differentiation of Th17 is inhibited by suppressing the OPN expression and regulating the secretion of inflammatory cytokines.
