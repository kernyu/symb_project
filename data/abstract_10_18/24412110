The optimization of a novel series of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) led to the identification of pyridone 36. In cell cultures, this new NNRTI shows a superior potency profile against a range of wild type and clinically relevant, resistant mutant HIV viruses. The overall favorable preclinical pharmacokinetic profile of 36 led to the prediction of a once daily low dose regimen in human. NNRTI 36, now known as MK-1439, is currently in clinical development for the treatment of HIV infection.
