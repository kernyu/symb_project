Transmitted HIV-1 exhibiting reduced susceptibility to protease and reverse transcriptase inhibitors is well documented but limited for integrase inhibitors and enfuvirtide. We describe here a case of transmitted 5 drug class-resistance in an antiretroviral (ARV)-naive patient who was successfully treated based on the optimized selection of an active ARV drug regimen. The value of baseline resistance testing to determine an optimal ARV treatment regimen is highlighted in this case report.
