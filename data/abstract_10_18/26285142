AIMS: To evaluate the diversity of Pseudomonads and antibiotic resistance profiles of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a hospital wastewater treatment plant (HWTP) located in Rio de Janeiro city, Brazil. Due its intrinsic multidrug resistance and its ability to colonize several environments, we selected Ps. aeruginosa isolates as indicator of antimicrobial resistance frequency. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-seven Ps. aeruginosa strains isolated from five stages of HWTP identified by rrs 16S rDNA sequencing were submitted against 12 antimicrobials through disc diffusion method. Among these isolates, 62.9% showed aztreonam resistance, followed by ticarcillin/clavulanic acid (33.3%) and cefepime (22.2%). Of these isolates, 22.2% were classified as multidrug-resistant (MDR >/= 3 classes). Five 16S rRNA gene libraries of Pseudomonas genus were constructed, one for each stages of the plant, yielding 93 sequences clustered in 41 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs). Each treatment step showed unique OTU's composition, suggesting changes in Pseudomonas spp. communities during the process. Several Pseudomonas species involved in biodegradation and bioremediation of xenobiotics were detected suggesting a positive impact in the wastewater treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our strategy using metagenomics associated with the isolation of Ps. aeruginosa strains as bio-indicator allowed us to assess their antimicrobial susceptibility, the viability and diversity of Pseudomonas species in the hospital wastewater. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The presence of MDR bacteria from treated effluents alerts for the need to improve these systems to avoid the spreading of resistance genes in aquatic ecosystems. This has special relevance in Brazil, where a significant portion of the population has no access to treated water.
