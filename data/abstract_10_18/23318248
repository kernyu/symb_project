The ability to produce exoenzymes of a Bacillus subtilis natto starter strain was improved through selection of a rifampicin-resistant phenotype. Proteomic and zymographic analyses showed increased production of cellulolytic and proteolytic enzymes and decreased production of levansucrase. This mutant had a mutation (S487L) in the beta-subunit of the RNA polymerase.
