This study was undertaken to characterize functions of the outer membrane protein OmpW, which potentially contributes to the development of colistin- and imipenem-resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii. Reconstitution of OmpW in artificial lipid bilayers showed that it forms small channels (23 pS in 1 m KCl) and markedly interacts with iron and colistin, but not with imipenem. In vivo, (55) Fe uptake assays comparing the behaviours of DeltaompW mutant and wild-type strains confirmed a role for OmpW in A. baumannii iron homeostasis. However, the loss of OmpW expression did not have an impact on A. baumannii susceptibilities to colistin or imipenem.
