Discouraging bacterial colonization of ocular biomaterials and implants is a significant challenge in ophthalmology as infections often lead to the need for secondary surgery, with associated risks and additional stress to patients. In this work we demonstrate for the first time the feasibility of an innovative antibacterial ocular prosthesis produced by depositing a silver nanocluster/silica composite layer on the poly(methyl methacrylate) implant surface via radio-frequency sputtering. Tape test performed according to relevant ASTM standard provided a preliminary evidence of the mechanical stability and good adhesion of the coating to the substrate (absence of macroscopic damage after tape removal). Coating integrity was maintained after prolonged soaking in aqueous medium (1 month). The antibacterial effect of the coating, associated to silver ion release upon contact with aqueous fluid, was confirmed by the in vitro formation of a 5-mm inhibition halo test against Staphylococcus aureus that is one of the most common bacteria involved in ocular infections. The approach proposed in the present study for facing implant-related ocular infections can have a significant impact in the field of ophthalmic biomaterials, suggesting a valuable alternative to the administration of antibiotics that may become ineffective due to bacterial resistance.
