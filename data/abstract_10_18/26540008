UNLABELLED: The aim of the study was to analyze the presenting signs and symptoms, diagnostic procedures, clinical course, pathogenic organisms and management of neck abscesses in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective medical records review comprised of 51 pediatric cases referred because of neck abscess from 2001 to 2014. Medical records of the patients were reviewed for demographic data, clinical presentation, treatment before referral, localization of the abscess, imaging evaluation, medical and surgical treatment, bacteriological data and complications. RESULTS: Average age of the patients was 4.9 years. 18 (35%) of the children were below one year of age. The submandibular was the most common area involved (41,2%). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) was performed in 45% of patients mainly with deep neck abscesses. All CECT scans showed the fluid collections. In all but one of the patients treated surgically and diagnosed with ultrasound and/or CECT surgical intervention revealed presence of pus. The most common pathogen was Staphylococcus aureus- SA (78% of all isolates) of which 24% were methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus - MRSA. Clindamycin resistance was detected in 28% of all SA isolates and in 67% (4/6) of all MRSA isolates. All MRSA isolates were sensitive to vancomycin. CONCLUSIONS: CECT is reliable imaging technique for diagnosing deep neck abscesses in children. Infants with neck abscesses are at higher risk of having MRSA as offending pathogen which should be taken into consideration when considering empiric treatment. Vancomycin is recommended as empiric antibiotic therapy in newborns with neck abscess.
