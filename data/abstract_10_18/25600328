The increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics has become a major public health concern bringing the threat of therapeutic impasses. In this context, control of the spread of highly-resistant bacteria emerging antibiotics (BHRe), such as glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (VRE) and Enterobacteriaceae producing carbapenemases (CPE), is based on a dual strategy of reducing the prescription of antibiotics to limit the pressure selection and preventing the spread from carriers. Prevention strategy is based on three different levels such as standard precautions for all patients with a particular focus on the management of excreta, and additional precautions for BHRe carriers. What makes it difficult is that carriage is usually completely asymptomatic, enterobacteria and enterococci are normal commensal of gut microbiota. Explosive dissemination of Enterobacteriaceae producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases in hospital and community heralds the emergence of CPE whose import by patients with a history of hospitalization in abroad may be the main source of spread in France.
