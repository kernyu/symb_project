BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The main cause of serious nosocomial infections is a Gram-negative pathogen known as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). Carbapenems are widely used as an appropriate treatment for these infections, however resistance to these agents has been observed and is increasing. Metallo beta-lactamase (MBLs) enzyme is one of the main causes of resistance to carbapenem. In the current study the frequency and production of VIM1 and VIM2 by imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates of patients hospitalized in Imam Reza hospital were evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 131 clinical samples were collected from patients hospitalized in Imam Reza hospital in Mashhad during a 15-month period from May 2011 to November 2012. After verification of P. aeruginosa isolates, antibiotic resistance patterns of isolates were determined for 14 antibiotics by Kirby-Bauer standard disk diffusion according to the CLSI guidelines. Combined-disk test was used for phenotypic determination of MBLs-producing isolates and after DNA extraction, genotypic determination of VIM1 and VIM2 metallo beta-lactamase genes was carried out using Multiplex-PCR. RESULTS: Of 63 imipenem-resistant isolates (48.5%), 56 (88.8%) were MBL-producing in phenotypic assessments. Also amongst imipenem-resistant isolates, the frequency of VIM1 and VIM2 genes were 58.7 and 3.17%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The results of the current study along with the results of the other conducted studies in Iran in recent years demonstrate that the average resistance to imipenem in P. aeruginosa isolates was 51.3% which has increased in comparison with the results in 2006 (32.9%). It was also determined that the frequency of VIM1 gene was more than VIM2 gene. In phenotypic assessment by using CD method, 49.6% of isolates were determined as MBLs-producing. The sensitivity and specificity of this method were verified in comparison with the results of PCR test.
