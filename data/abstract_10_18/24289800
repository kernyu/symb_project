INTRODUCTION: The potency, tolerability and convenience of antiretroviral agents have all significantly improved over the past years, making lifelong HIV therapy easier. However, several specific needs are still unmet, including low daily pill burden, friendly metabolic profile, lack of (or few) drug interactions and high resistance barrier. AREAS COVERED: Updated summary of evidence-based information about the efficacy and safety of the most recently approved or forthcoming antiretroviral agents is provided. All data on antiretrovirals in the most advanced development stages available in peer-reviewed journals or presented at international meetings has been reviewed. EXPERT OPINION: Dolutegravir displays greater barrier to resistance and requires simpler administration than other currently existing drugs within the same class. Newer pharmacoenhancers (i.e., cobicistat), CCR5 antagonists (i.e., cenicriviroc) and nucleotide prodrugs (i.e., tenofovir alafenamide fumarate) show promising results and will expand the current HIV armamentarium. The development of newer once-daily, single-tablet coformulations will further improve drug adherence and maximize the success of antiretroviral therapy.
