The purpose of this study was to investigate the occurrence of Salmonella in raw chicken meat samples collected at the Romanian seaside and to evaluate the antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates. In 2012, 317 chicken meat samples from slaughterhouses (n = 289) and retail markets (n = 28) were evaluated. Overall, 13.2% (42) of the samples contained Salmonella; 12.8% (37) and 17.8% (5) from the chicken carcasses at slaughterhouses and the fresh meat from retail markets, respectively. Eight serotypes of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica were identified: Infantis (18 isolates), Bredeney (7), Virchow (6), Djugu (4), Grampian (4), Brandenburg (1), Derby (1), and Ruzizi (1). The isolates were resistant to tetracycline (66.6% of isolates), nalidixic acid (64.3%), sulfamethoxazole (64.3%), ciprofloxacin (61.9%), streptomycin (59.5%), trimethoprim (33.3%), ampicillin (9.5%), chloramphenicol (7.1%), and gentamicin (2.4%). No resistance was found to cefotaxime and ceftazidime. Thirty (71.4%) of the 42 tested isolates had multidrug resistance patterns to at least two antimicrobials. This survey highlighted a multidrug-resistant Salmonella contamination rate in raw chicken meat in this area of Romania, which can seriously threaten human health.
