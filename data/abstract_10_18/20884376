To improve the management of leishmaniasis, new drugs and/or alternative therapeutic strategies are required. Combination therapy of antileishmanial drugs is currently considered as one of the most rational approaches to lower treatment failure rate and limit drug resistance spreading. Nicotinamide (NAm), also known as vitamin B3 that is already is used in human therapy, exerts in vitro antileishmanial activity. Drug combination studies, performed on L. infantum axenic amastigotes, revealed that NAm significantly improves the antileishmanial activity of trivalent antimony in a synergistic manner while it shows additive activity with amphotericin B and slightly antagonizes pentamidine activity. NAm also significantly increases the toxicity of pentavalent antimony against the intracellular forms of L. infantum, L. amazonensis and L. braziliensis. The potential of NAm to be used as adjuvant during leishmaniasis chemotherapy is further discussed.
