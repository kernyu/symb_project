The wide dissemination of carbapenemase producing K. pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) has caused a public health crisis of global dimensions, due to the serious infections in hospitalized patients associated with high mortality. In 2014, we aim to review clinical data on KPC-Kp at a time when a pro-active strategy (combating the problem before it is established) is no longer useful, focusing on epidemiology, patient risk profile, infection control, digestive tract colonization and treatment issues such as the role of carbapenems or carbapenem sparing strategies, colistin and resistance, dual carbapenem administration and the role of tigecycline. All these issues are illustrated prospectively to provide a forum for a Consensus strategy when not only intensive care units but also medical and surgical wards are affected by the epidemics.
