BACKGROUND: Large-scale multi-region studies are urgently needed to provide comprehensive and up-to-date information on the antibiotic resistance of Helicobacter pylori that is critical for selecting the most optimal eradication regimens. AIMS: To determine the resistance patterns of Helicobacter pylori strains isolated from dyspeptic patients. METHODS: This is a prospective, multicentre, cross-sectional, observational study. Helicobacter pylori cultures were successful in 600 patients (never receiving eradication therapy) from Northern, Eastern, Middle, and Southern regions between 2008 and 2012. Resistance to amoxicillin, clarithromycin, metronidazole, levofloxacin, tetracycline, and rifampicin was determined by Epsilometer test. RESULTS: The overall resistance rate was highest for metronidazole (403, 67.2%), followed by clarithromycin (225, 37.5%), levofloxacin (201, 33.5%), rifampicin (85, 14.2%), amoxicillin (41, 6.8%), and tetracycline (21, 3.5%). There were 16.3% isolates susceptible to all tested antibiotics, followed by mono-resistance (34.2%), double resistance (27.0%), triple resistance (16.8%), quadruple resistance (4.7%), quintuple resistance (0.7%) and sextuple resistance (0.3%). Independent factors influencing antibiotic resistance were gender (to levofloxacin), age (to levofloxacin), and endoscopic finding (to clarithromycin, metronidazole, and levofloxacin). Among the clarithromycin-resistant isolates, 75.6% and 48.0% were also resistant to metronidazole and levofloxacin, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Helicobacter pylori resistance to commonly used antibiotics in China is a very serious issue, due to the high resistance rate and general multiple resistance.
