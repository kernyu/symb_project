Subchronic intoxications in rats induced by repeated intraperitoneal injections of stable water suspensions of silver or copper oxide nanoparticles in low dosage were manifested by adverse shifts in some functional and biochemical indices, by development of histo-structural changes in different tissues and by poly-organ fragmentation of DNA. All these manifestations of toxicity were substantially attenuated against the background of parallel oral administration of bioprotective complexes comprising vitamins, trace elements, pectin, some amino acids and a fish oil preparation rich in omega-3 fee fatty acids, this composition has been adjusted to mechanisms of action of this or that nanomaterial.
