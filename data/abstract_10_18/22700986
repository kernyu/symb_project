Over recent years, several examples of natural ribosomally synthesized circular proteins and peptides from diverse organisms have been described. They are a group of proteins for which the precursors must be post-translationally modified to join the N and C termini with a peptide bond. This feature appears to confer a range of potential advantages because these proteins show increased resistance to proteases and higher thermodynamic stability, both of which improve their biological activity. They are produced by prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms and show diverse biological activities, related mostly to a self-defense or competition mechanism of the producer organisms, with the only exception being the circular pilins. This minireview highlights ribosomally synthesized circular proteins produced by members of the domain Bacteria: circular bacteriocins, cyanobactins, and circular pilins. We pay special attention to the genetic organization of the biosynthetic machinery of these molecules, the role of circularization, and the differences in the possible circularization mechanisms.
