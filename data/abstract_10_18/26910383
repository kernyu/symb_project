PURPOSE: To report the results of IFNalpha2a therapy in patients with Behcet uveitis refractory to azathioprine-cyclosporine combination treatment. METHODS: In a retrospective study, 39 patients treated with either azathioprine-cyclosporine combination treatment (group 1, n = 23) or IFNalpha2a (group 2, n = 16) with a diagnosis of ocular Behcet disease (BD), were included in the study. Group 2 consisted of patients who did not respond to conventional combination therapy, and were therefore treated with IFNalpha2a. Clinical response and relapse rates were recorded for each group. RESULTS: The mean number of uveitis attacks/year per patient was 0.8 +/- 1.6 in Group 1. In Group 2, a significant decrease in the mean number of uveitis attacks/year per patient was observed after initiation of IFNalpha2a (2.4 +/- 1.8 vs 1.3 +/- 2.0) (p<0.05). When the two groups were compared after administration of IFNalpha2a therapy, no statistical difference was found in terms of uveitis attack/year and attack-free intervals, with a partial response to both treatments. CONCLUSIONS: IFNalpha2a therapy is an effective alternative for Behcet uveitis patients where conventional combination therapy fails.
