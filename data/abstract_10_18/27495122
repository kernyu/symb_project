Targeting the bactoprenol-coupled cell wall precursor lipid II is a validated antibacterial strategy. In this review, selected prototype lipid II-binding antibiotics of different chemical classes are discussed. Although these compounds attack the same molecular target, they trigger nuanced and diverse cellular effects. Consequently, the mechanisms of antibacterial resistance and the likelihood of resistance development may vary substantially.
