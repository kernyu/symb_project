This study assessed the demographics, antimicrobial susceptibility, and molecular epidemiology of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) and health care-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) in Canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. Among 3589 S. aureus, 889 (24.8%) were MRSA; 224 (25.2%) were CA-MRSA genotypes and 644 (72.4%) were HA-MRSA genotypes. The prevalence of CA-MRSA genotypes increased from 19.5% in 2007 to 31.9% in 2009 (P < .001). CMRSA10/USA300 (73.7%) was the predominant CA-MRSA epidemic type; the most common HA-MRSA epidemic type was CMRSA2/USA100/800 (83.5%). CA-MRSA genotypes carried SCCmec type IVa (98.2%) and were largely agr type I (73.2%). Most HA-MRSA genotypes were SCCmec type II (81.2%) and agr type II (83.4%). Panton-Valentine leukocidin was detected in 201/224 (89.7%) CA-MRSA genotypes and 3/644 (0.5%) HA-MRSA genotypes. An increase in vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was observed in HA-MRSA genotypes overall, with 1.3% (4/305) of strains in 2007 and 4.6% (7/152) in 2009 exhibiting vancomycin MICs of 2 mug/mL. No MRSA resistance occurred with linezolid, daptomycin, or tigecycline. In conclusion, CA-MRSA genotypes represented 25.2% of all MRSA and continue to increase in prevalence in Canadian hospitals.
