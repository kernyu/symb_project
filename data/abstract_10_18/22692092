The associations of acute HIV infection (AHI) and other predictors with transmitted drug resistance (TDR) prevalence were assessed in a cohort of HIV-infected, antiretroviral-naive patients. AHI was defined as being seronegative with detectable HIV RNA. Binomial regression was used to estimate prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations with TDR. Among 43 AHI patients, TDR prevalence was 20.9%, whereas prevalence was 8.6% among 677 chronically infected patients. AHI was associated with 1.9 times the prevalence of TDR (95% confidence intervals: 1.0 to 3.6) in multivariable analysis. AHI patients may represent a vanguard group that portends increasing TDR in the future.
