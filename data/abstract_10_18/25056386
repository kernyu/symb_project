Because the threat of infectious diseases can cause widespread fear in a community, these diseases receive much public attention. Collaborations that bring together industry, academia, regulators, and the public can lead to improved and accelerated drug development. The collaborations must be grounded in strong science and expertise in clinical trials. Development of drugs to treat infections caused by resistant bacteria, drugs to treat hepatitis C virus (HCV), and drugs to prevent HIV is taking advantage of these collaborations.
