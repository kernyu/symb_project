Mycoplasma genitalium is an important pathogen that is transmitted through sexual contact. For patients diagnosed with M. genitalium infection, the current guidelines recommend 1 g of azithromycin as the first-line treatment. Moxifloxacin is used as a second-line drug due to its remarkable efficacy; however, increased use of moxifloxacin to treat M. genitalium infections has caused the emergence of cases of moxifloxacin treatment failure. This meta-analysis aims to estimate the treatment efficacy of moxifloxacin for M. genitalium infection. Electronic databases were searched for articles published from 1983 to the end of May 2016 using the following search terms: ( Mycoplasma genitalium) AND (moxifloxacin OR 1-cyclopropyl-7-(2,8-diazabicyclo(4.3.0)non-8-yl)-6-fluoro-8-methoxy-1,4-dihydro- 4-oxo-3-quinoline carboxylic acid OR Proflox OR moxifloxacin hydrochloride OR Octegra OR Avelox OR Avalox OR Izilox OR Actira OR [treatment efficacy]). All included studies were published in English; all participants were diagnosed with M. genitalium infection, and microbial cure times were measured within 12 months after treatment. Treatment efficacy was measured as microbial cure at the final follow-up after treatment. In total, 17 studies including 252 participants met the inclusion criteria. The majority of these studies were observational. The random-effects pooled microbial cure rate was 96% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90%-99%; I(2 )= 28.59%, P = 0.13). For studies with sample collection deadlines prior to 2010, the pooled microbial cure rate was 100% (95% CI, 99%-100%; I(2 )= 0.00%, P = 1.00). For studies with sample collection deadlines of 2010 and later, the pooled microbial cure rate was 89% (95% CI, 82%-94%; I(2 )= 0.00%, P = 0.59). The elimination rate of moxifloxacin for M. genitalium infection has decreased from 100% to 89% since 2010. This decline merits considerable attention. We suggest close follow-up to investigate the efficacy of moxifloxacin for treating M. genitalium infections. Additionally, sentinel points should be established to detect mutations in the gyrA/B and parC/E genes, which are associated with moxifloxacin resistance.
