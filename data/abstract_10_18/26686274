Evidence-based blood culture (BC) testing is of utmost importance for intensive care unit (ICU) patients suspected for sepsis. Knowledge of the aetiological agent and its susceptibility to anti-infective agents enables the clinician to initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy and guides diagnostic procedures. This has been shown to reduce mortality, ICU stay and antibiotic overuse. Whereas microbiological laboratory practice has been highly standardised, shortfalls in pre-analytic procedures in the ICU have a significant effect on the diagnostic yield. Currently, surveillance data on BC practice lack hospital-, patient- and laboratory-based denominator data. Supporting information on differences in the clinical practice of BC testing, differences in the characteristics of the institution and the case-mix on specific wards, as well as differences in the availability of microbiological laboratories is demanded on a population basis. A population-based survey on BC practice has been established for the German Federal State of Thuringia connecting both hospitals and microbiological laboratories within an electronic registry for immediate enrolment of BC findings (AlertsNet; http://www.alertsnet.de). The registry includes microbiological results and clinical data as well as institutional variables (e.g. case severity indices) from all patients with clinically relevant positive BCs at the participating centres. The main objectives are to sustain and expand a population-based surveillance and warning system for the assessment of diagnosis, risk factors, treatment and outcomes of hospitalised patients and to improve outcomes of patients with bloodstream infections.
