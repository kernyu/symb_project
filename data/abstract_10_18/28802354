INTRODUCTION: Species of Streptococcus are classified based on their hemolytic properties into alpha and beta types. And, since antimicrobial drug resistance is an increasingly problematic issue, the efforts to develop modalities that would overcome this obstacle and avoid antibiotic side effects is an ongoing challenge. METHODS AND MATERIALS: 20 patients from both sexes were selected. The isolated organisms were identified according to standard laboratory methods. Bacterial Cultures were subjected to the low-level diode laser (660 nm), methylene blue (MB) as a photosensitizing agent and for silver nanoparticles. RESULTS: All the experimental groups showed statistically lower values of CFU/ml than the positive control group. CONCLUSION: The photoactivated MB, silver nanoparticles conjugate showed the maximum inhibitory effect on Streptococci, which opens a gate to further investigation of such a promising protocol to establish a safe and efficient method of management for resistant cases of streptococcal tonsillar infections.
