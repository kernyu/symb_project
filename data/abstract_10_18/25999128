Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase I (CATI) detoxifies the antibiotic chloramphenicol and confers a corresponding resistance to bacteria. In this study we identified this enzyme as a steroid acetyltransferase and designed a new and efficient Escherichia-coli-based biocatalyst for the regioselective acetylation of C21 hydroxy groups in steroids of pharmaceutical interest. The cells carried a recombinant catI gene controlled by a constitutive promoter. The capacity of the whole-cell system to modify different hydroxysteroids was investigated, and NMR spectroscopy revealed that all substrates were selectively transformed into the corresponding 21-acetoxy derivatives. The biotransformation was optimized, and the reaction mechanism is discussed on the basis of a computationally modeled substrate docking into the crystal structure of CATI.
