Henan Province is one of the regions with the highest tuberculosis (TB) burden in China. Among isolates collected from Zhongmou County, Henan, 21.28% (10/47) of those from 2001 and 22.95% (10/61) from 2007 were resistant to at least one drug (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol or streptomycin); 90.74% (98/108) of the isolates were from the Beijing family, and 108 exhibited 105 different mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units-variable number of tandem repeats patterns. This study preliminarily reveals that Henan Province is still a high prevalence region for drug-resistant TB, and strains collected from local TB cases have diverse genotypes, of which the Beijing family type is predominant.
