The enzymes responsible for peptidoglycan amidation in Staphylococcus aureus, MurT and GatD, were recently identified and shown to be required for optimal expression of resistance to beta-lactams, bacterial growth, and resistance to lysozyme. In this study, we analyzed the impact of peptidoglycan amidation in representative strains of the most widespread clones of methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA). The inhibition of the expression of murT-gatD operon resulted in different phenotypes of resistance to beta-lactams and lysozyme according to the different genetic backgrounds. Further, clonal lineages CC1 and CC398 (community-acquired MRSA [CA-MRSA]) showed a stronger dependency on MurT-GatD for resistance to beta-lactams, when compared to the impact of the impairment of the cell wall step catalyzed by MurF. In the remaining backgrounds similar phenotypes of beta-lactam resistance were observed upon the impairment of both cell-wall-related genes. Therefore, for CA-related backgrounds, the predominant beta-lactam resistance mechanism seems to involve genes associated with secondary modifications of peptidoglycan. On the other hand, the lack of glutamic acid amidation had a more substantial impact on lysozyme resistance for cells of CA-MRSA backgrounds, than for hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA). However, no significant differences were found in the resistance level of the respective peptidoglycan structure, suggesting that the lysozyme resistance mechanism involves other factors. Taken together, these results suggested that the different genetic lineages of MRSA were able to develop different molecular strategies to overcome the selective pressures experienced during evolution.
