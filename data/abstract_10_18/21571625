Nosocomial yeast infections have increased significantly worldwide and especially in surgical and intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Although Candida species have various degrees of susceptibility to frequently used drugs, antifungal resistance is rare. A ten-year retrospective surveillance of candidemia was carried out in a University Hospital of Southern Italy. The aim of this study was the determination of Candida bloodstream infections (BSI) and central venous catheter (CVC)- related episodes, prevalence and in vitro susceptibility. 320 candidemia episodes were registered and 374 yeasts collected. Etest and Sensititre methods were used to test the isolates' susceptibility to amphotericin B, anidulafungin, caspofungin, fluconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole and voriconazole. The results were compared with those of CLSI reference broth microdilution method. Most yeasts were susceptible to all antifungal drugs, with the exception of C. Glabrata susceptibility to triazoles and C. tropicalis to fluconazole and voriconazole. As expected, C. parapsilosis isolates were generally associated with higher echinocandin minimum inhibitory concentrations (miCs) than the other Candida species. This study confirms the different antifungal susceptibility patterns among species, and underlines the need to perform antifungal susceptibility testing of clinically relevant yeasts.
