BACKGROUND: There has been an increasing incidence of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) infections in recent years. The objective of this study was to determine specific risk factors for and outcome of bacteremia due to CRAB isolates among our ICU patients with A. baumannii bacteremia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Among 96 patients with ICU-acquired A. baumannii bacteremia, 30 patients with CRAB were compared with the remaining 66 with carbapenem-susceptible A. baumannii (CSAB) isolates. RESULTS: Recent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to CRAB (OR 16.74, 95% CI 3.16-88.79, p = 0.001) and a greater number of intravascular devices (OR 3.93, 95% CI 1.9-13.0, p = 0.025) were independently associated with CRAB bacteremia acquisition. Patients with CRAB bacteremia had a lower severity of illness on admission than those with CSAB. Although, by univariate analysis, patients with CRAB were more likely to have had exposure to colistin, carbapenems and linezolid, multivariate analysis did not revealed any significant association. The mortality was not different between patients with CRAB and CSAB bacteremia (43.3 vs. 46.9%, p = 0.740). Severity of organ failure (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.20-1.67, p = 0.001), and increased white blood cell (WBC) count (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.01-1.19, p = 0.036), at bacteremia onset were independently associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: VAP due to CRAB and excess use of intravascular devices are the most important risk factors for CRAB bacteremia in our ICU. Severity of organ failure and WBC count at A. baumannii bacteremia onset are independently associated with mortality.
