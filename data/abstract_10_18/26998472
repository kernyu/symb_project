BACKGROUND: Marking pencils which are frequently used in orthodontics may cause microbial contamination. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of three disinfection and sterilization methods (autoclave, glutaraldehyde solution, and Deconex spray) on orthodontic markers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty orthodontic markers were divided into four groups each 30 pencils: One control group and three groups for three different disinfection/sterilization methods. To evaluate the effectiveness of these methods, pencils were initially contaminated by common pathogen by immersing the pencils in a suspension containing 1.5 x 10(8) CFU/ml organisms. Then, the pencils were subjected to corresponding disinfection/sterilization methods, and the number of remaining microorganisms was calculated and compared with control group. RESULTS: In the control group, the mean number of Escherichia coli was significantly higher than the other two microorganisms (P = 0.01, P = 0.031). However, the mean numbers of Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans were not significantly different (P = 0.1). After sterilization with autoclave and glutaraldehyde, no microbial growth was observed, whereas after disinfection with Deconx spray some colonies of microorganisms still could be observed. CONCLUSION: Autoclaving and glutaraldehyde solution are the best methods for disinfecting orthodontic markers.
