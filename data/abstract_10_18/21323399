INTRODUCTION: Acridines are highly important heterocyclic compounds with immense biological significance as they act as the central core of antitumor, anti-protozoan, antiviral and multi-drug resistance modulating agents. The tricyclic aromatic structure of acridine is primarily responsible for its intercalation with DNA by controlling its biological profile and the substitution pattern of the molecule, which leads to several other applications. AREAS COVERED: In this review, acridine-based functional molecules and patents of acridine derivatives filed from 2009 to 2010 are discussed. The latest information about the medical importance of new acridine-based molecules is also discussed (e.g., materials with sensing and electrical/thermal properties). EXPERT OPINION: The tricyclic aromatic heterocyclic structure of acridine has a lot of potential for biological and material utilization. The versatility of fluorescent acridines could be further enhanced by introducing amino-acid chains or other polar substituents on the central moiety, which due to increased water solubility could increase their effectiveness under physiological conditions.
