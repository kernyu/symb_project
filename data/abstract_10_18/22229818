Antimicrobial-resistant bacteria represent a major threat to human and animal health. We compared equine fecal samples (n=264) from 138 horses from hospital and nonhospital (livery stable and riding school) premises in North West England to determine the prevalence of Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Campylobacter and rates of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli strains. Campylobacter jejuni was detected only in hospitalized horses (1.1%), and no Salmonella was identified. Data analysis of the horses' management and veterinary treatments (Tx) identified risk factors associated with shedding of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli. The hospital was the major source of resistant and multi-drug-resistant (MDR) E. coli. Moreover, shedding of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli was associated significantly with hospitalization for a gastrointestinal problem (odds ratio [OR]:+/-95% confidence intervals=8.50:1.79-40.32), receipt of oral antimicrobial Tx (OR=3.52:1.11-11.10), multiple antimicrobial Tx in hospital (OR/Tx=1.05:1.01-1.09), or geldings (OR=4.62:1.23-17.46). Interestingly, intravenous antimicrobial Tx was negatively associated with shedding of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli (OR=0.18:0.04-0.76). MDR E. coli was associated with hospitalization, antimicrobial Tx in hospital (OR/Tx=3.65:1.54-8.68), and increased age (OR/year=1.11:1.03-1.19). Thus, equine hospitals in this geographic location appear to be an important source of antimicrobial-resistant and MDR E. coli strains, but unlikely reservoirs of Salmonella or Campylobacter. Thus, it is important to moderate antimicrobial Tx given to hospitalized horses to lessen exposure and fecal shedding of resistant pathogens.
