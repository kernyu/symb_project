In England in 2015, Shigella sonnei isolates from men who have sex with men produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and exhibited macrolide resistance. Whole-genome sequencing showed a close relationship among the isolates, which harbored a plasmid that was previously identified in a shigellosis outbreak among this population but has acquired a mobile element.
