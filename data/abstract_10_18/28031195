By searching the Integrall integron and GenBank databases, a novel open reading frame (ORF) of 51 nucleotides (nts) (ORF-17) overlapping the previously described ORF-11 was identified within the attI1 site in virtually all class 1 integrons. Using a set of isogenic plasmid constructs carrying a single gene cassette (blaGES-1) and possessing a canonical translation initiation region, we found that ORF-17 contributes to GES-1 expression.
