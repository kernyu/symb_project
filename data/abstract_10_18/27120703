INTRODUCTION: The furiously advancing cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) along with the recent emergence of total drug resistant TB and TB-AIDS comorbidity present an increased threat to global public health. Knowledge of pharmacokinetic properties helps in selecting an appropriate anti-TB dosage regimen to achieve optimal results in patients. AREAS COVERED: This article provides a brief compilation of the information available regarding published pharmacokinetic data for anti-TB drugs and may act as a single window for investigators/medical practitioners in this field. The information regarding absorption, tissue distribution, elimination and pharmacokinetic interactions of the first- and second-line anti-TB drugs and candidate drugs under clinical trials is discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Pharmacokinetic properties such as poor absorption, too short biological half-life, extensive first-pass metabolism, drug-food and drug-drug related interactions are not attractive for prospective anti-TB drugs and significantly contribute to treatment failure and further resistance. The long duration, monotonous and multidrug treatment plan leads to poor patient compliance and resulted in a greater occurrence of anti-TB drug resistance worldwide. Few new agents, which are in development phase, are considering the aspect of shortening duration of the treatment regimen and provide a boost in therapy that is sorely needed.
