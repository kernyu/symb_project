Acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) are associated with remarkable morbidity, and often require hospitalization. The cause of most ABSSSI is aerobic Gram-positive cocci, including Staphylococcus aureus, and beta-hemolytic streptococci. Tedizolid phosphate is a novel oxazolidinone prodrug whose active moiety is tedizolid. It has shown potent in vitro activity against Gram-positive pathogens, encompassing methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and strains resistant to vancomycin or linezolid. Animal studies suggested bactericidal activity in vivo. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated a good penetration into skin and soft tissues, and suitability for once-daily administration, either orally or intravenously at the same dosage. Pivotal phase III studies showed that tedizolid phosphate at 200 mg once daily for 6 days is noninferior to linezolid 600 mg twice daily for 10 days in ABSSSI patients, whereas gastrointestinal disorders were less frequent with tedizolid phosphate than linezolid. Tedizolid phosphate has been approved by the U.S. FDA, as Sivextro(R) to treat adult patients with ABSSSI.
