Inappropriate antibiotic therapy in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is associated with increased mortality. Using broad-spectrum antibiotics for 48 h until the results of conventional cultures and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) are available, may promote the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria. Performing AST directly on clinical respiratory samples would hasten the process by at least 24 h. Here, we analysed the diagnostic performance of a rapid method combining mass spectrometry and direct AST (DAST), and compared it with the conventional method (mass spectrometry with conventional AST (CAST)). Additionally, we assessed its potential impact on antimicrobial use in patients. Over a period of 18 months, the two methods were performed on 85 bronchoalveolar lavages obtained from intensive care unit patients with suspected VAP, and in which Gram-negative bacilli were observed on direct examination. Only the CAST results were reported to the clinicians. DAST produced useable results in 85.9% of the patients. The sensitivity and negative predictive values of DAST were 100% for all antibiotics tested, except gentamicin (97.1%, (95% CI 93.3-101) and 97.4% (93.7-101), respectively) and amikacin (88.9% (81.7-96.1) and 96.4% (92.1-100.7), respectively), compared with CAST. Specificity and positive predictive values ranged from 82.9 (74.2-91.5) to 100%, and from 86.4 (78.5-94.2) to 100%, respectively. If the DAST results had been reported to the clinicians, treatment could have been optimized 24 h earlier in 35/85 (41.2%) patients, with 17 carbapenem patient-days saved. Overall, routine use of the DAST method could help optimize earlier antibiotic treatment in patients with suspected VAP.
