Oritavancin (MIC50/90, 0.03/0.06 to 0.12 mug/ml) had potent activity against linezolid-resistant staphylococci, as well as Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium (oritavancin MIC50/90, 0.015/0.12 mug/ml against both species). All linezolid-resistant isolates were inhibited by oritavancin at </=0.12 mug/ml. These results confirmed the absence of cross-resistance between linezolid and oritavancin in staphylococci and enterococci.
