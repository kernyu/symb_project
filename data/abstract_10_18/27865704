A new series of caffemide were synthesized and their antioxidant and antibacterial activities were explored. Antioxidant and antibacterial activities were measured of different structures of caffemide containing different functional groups. Anti-oxidative caffemides 1b and 1g showed significantly higher activity against different bacteria with MIC values less than 50mug/ml. These anti-oxidative and antibacterial properties of caffemides might be helpful for the treatment of secondary infections and discovery of new antibiotics.
