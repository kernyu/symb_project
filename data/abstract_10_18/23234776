OBJECTIVE: Neonatal purulent meningitis is a severe infection responsible for high mortality and disabling sequelae. Escherichia coli is the main pathogen of neonatal purulent meningitis. This study explored the clinical characteristics and antibiotic resistance of Escherichia coli-induced neonatal meningitis. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed. A total of 31 cases of neonatal purulent meningitis caused by Escherichia coli were identified in the neonatal intensive care unit between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2011. The clinical characteristics and antibiotic sensitivity test results were analyzed. RESULTS: Fever, poor feeding, lethargy and seizure were common clinical signs of neonatal purulent meningitis caused by Escherichia coli. Acute complications mainly included hyponatremia (17 cases), hydrocephalus (8 cases), subdural collection (2 cases), ventriculitis (2 cases) and cerebral infarction (1 case). Thirty neonates (97%) had increased CRP levels. Of the 31 patients, 14 cases were cured and 12 had adverse outcomes (5 patients died during hospitalization). Escherichia coli strains were resistant (>50%) to commonly used penicillins and cephalosporins between 2007 and 2011, presenting significantly higher resistance rates than between 2001 and 2006. The detection rate of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs)-producing strains between 2007 and 2011 increased significantly compared with between 2001 and 2006 (57% vs 0). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical manifestations of neonatal purulent meningitis caused by Escherichia coli are non specific. The outcome is poor. Monitoring of CRP levels is valuable for the early diagnosis of neonatal purulent meningitis. The antimicrobial resistance rates of Escherichia coli are increasing, especially to cephalosporins. The percentage of ESBLs-producing strains is increasing over the years.
