Epigenetic alterations, including dysregulated DNA methylation and histone modifications, govern the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). Cancer cells exploit epigenetic regulation to control cellular pathways, including apoptotic and metastatic signals. Since aberrations in epigenome can be pharmacologically reversed by DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase inhibitors, epigenetics in combination with standard agents are currently envisaged as a new therapeutic frontier in cancer, expected to overcome drug resistance associated with current treatments. In this study, we challenged this idea and demonstrated that the combination of azacitidine and romidepsin with IFN-alpha owns a high therapeutic potential, targeting the most aggressive cellular components of CRC, such as metastatic cells and cancer stem cells (CSCs), via tight control of key survival and death pathways. Moreover, the antitumor efficacy of this novel pharmacological approach is associated with induction of signals of immunogenic cell death. Of note, a previously undisclosed key role of IFN-alpha in inducing both antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on CSCs of CRC was also found. Overall, these findings open a new frontier on the suitability of IFN-alpha in association with epigenetics as a novel and promising therapeutic approach for CRC management.
