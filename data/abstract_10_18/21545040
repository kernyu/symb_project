The amino acid and peptide derivatives of 1-adamantane carboxylic acid and rimantadine (18 compounds) have been first synthesized and investigated for their activity against influenza A virus (H1N1, H1N1v). In a series of obtained adamantine derivatives, some compounds have been found to be able to inhibit rimantadine-resistant influenza A virus strains. Thus, the antiviral properties of rimantadine can be restored.
