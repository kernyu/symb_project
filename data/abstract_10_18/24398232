A growing number of beta-lactamases have been reported in Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates. The aim of this study was to investigate the diversity of beta-lactamases in the collection of 51 ceftazidime-resistant P. aeruginosa clinical isolates in four hospitals of southern China. Among these isolates, variable degrees of resistance to other beta-lactam and non-beta-lactam agents were observed. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) revealed a high degree of clonality with five main genotypes. Of the 51 isolates tested, 35 (68.6%) were identified as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers, with 35 producing PER-1, 1 CTX-M-3, 7 CTX-M-15 and 1 CTX-M-14. Most (82.9%, 29/35) PER-1-producing isolates were collected from two hospitals between January and April in 2008 and belonged to the same PFGE pattern (pattern B) with similar antibiogram and beta-lactamase profiles, which suggested an outbreak of this clone at the time. The prevalence of CTX-M-type ESBL (17.6%, 9/51) was unexpectedly high. One isolate was identified as producing VIM-2. Furthermore, we also reported an occurrence of a novel OXA-10 variant, OXA-246, in 14 P. aeruginosa isolates. In addition, AmpC overproduction was found to be the beta-lactamase-mediated mechanism responsible for ceftazidime resistance in 6 isolates (11.8%). Our results revealed an overall diversity of beta-lactamases and outbreak of a PER-1-producing clone among ceftazidime-resistant P. aeruginosa in southern China.
