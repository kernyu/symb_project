Essential facts Antimicrobial resistance develops when medicines are used inappropriately. Global estimates suggest that every year more than 700,000 people die from drug-resistant strains of common bacterial and viral infections, such as tuberculosis, malaria and HIV. If antimicrobial resistance continues to increase, this number could rise to 10 million a year by 2050.
