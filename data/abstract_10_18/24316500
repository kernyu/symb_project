Edwardsiella tarda is an intracellular pathogen that causes edwardsiellosis in fish. Our previous study suggests that cell-mediated immunity (CMI) plays an essential role in protection against E. tarda infection. In the present study, we adoptively transferred T-cell subsets sensitized with E. tarda to isogenic naive ginbuna crucian carp to determination the T-cell subsets involved in protecting fish from E. tarda infection. Recipients of CD4(+) and CD8alpha(+) cells acquired significant resistance to infection with E. tarda 8 days after sensitization, indicating that helper T cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes plays crucial roles in protective immunity to E. tarda. Moreover, transfer of sensitized CD8alpha(+) cells up-regulated the expression of genes encoding interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and perforin, suggesting that protective immunity to E. tarda involves cell-mediated cytotoxicity and interferon-gamma-mediated induction of CMI. The results establish that CMI plays a crucial role in immunity against E. tarda. These findings provide novel insights into understanding the role of CMI to intracellular pathogens of fish.
