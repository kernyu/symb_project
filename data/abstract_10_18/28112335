In order to study the clonal relationship and blaKPC gene detection in clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to carbapenems, we analyzed 22 clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae with resistance to imipenem and/ or meropenem, isolated in the laboratory of bacteriology at the University Hospital "Antonio Patricio de Alcala" (HUAPA) from the Cumana city, Sucre state, Venezuela, for a period of five consecutive years. Susceptibility to different antimicrobials was determined, and the presence of carbapenemases was detected by modified Hodge method, phenyl boronic acid synergy and combination discs. blaKPC gene detection was conducted by polymerase chain reaction and the clonal relationship was determined by pulsed field electrophoresis. High rates of antimicrobial resistance were found, five strains were negative, at least one phenotypic method, and all carried the blaKPC gene. Clonal spread was observed only in the intensive care unit (ICU), while in other services, polyclonality was found. We concluded that blaKPC gene is present in K. pneumoniae strains resistant to carbapenems isolated in the HUAPA and clonal spread it was only in the ICU.
