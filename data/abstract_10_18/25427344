This review describes research conducted in Thailand from 2000 to 2013 on the discovery of new compounds from local flora and fauna, including those of marine organisms from coastal regions, which have antiplasmodial activity against Plasmodium falciparum growth in culture. These antiplasmodials comprised alkaloids, angucyclinones, anthraquinones, azaanthraquinone, azaphilones, ben- zoquinones, bioxanthracenes, carbazomycins, chalcones, chromone, clerodane, coumarins, cyclomarin, cyclopeptides, cytochalasins, depsidones, depudecin, flavaglines, flavonoids, furans, isoflavonoid limonoids, macrolides, nucleoside, oxepin, peptides, phloroglucinol, polylactone, polypropionate, preussomerins, prodigiosin, pterocarpans, pyrenocines, pyridones, pyrrolidines, quassinoids, quinone, stilbenes, styryl lactones, terpenoids, tetramic acids, tetronic acids, tri- norcadalenes, tropolones, xanthones, and a variety of miscellaneous molecules (a total of 293 compounds). The review also describes the screening and synthesis of novel chemicals targeted against parasite enzymes, (carbonic anhydrase, cy- tochrome bcl, dihydrofolate reductase and orotidine 5'-monophosphate decar- boxylase), which have the potential of being developed into antimalarial drugs. Possible future trends in antimalarial drug research in Thailand are discussed. This review describes research conducted in Thailand from 2000 to 2013
