Tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is amongst the foremost infectious diseases. Treatment of tuberculosis is a complex process due to various factors including a patient's inability to persevere with a combined treatment regimen, the difficulty in eradicating the infection in immune-suppressed patients, and multidrug resistance (MDR). Extensive research circumscribing molecules to counteract this disease has led to the identification of many inhibitory small molecules. Among these are chalcone derivatives along with curcumin analogs. In this review article, we summarize the reported literature regarding anti tubercular activity of chalcone derivatives and synthetic curcumin analogs. Our goal is to provide an analysis of research to date in order to facilitate the synthesis of superior antitubercular chalcone derivatives and curcumin analogs.
