The natural compound camptothecin (CPT) derivatives have widely been used for anti-cancer treatments, including lung cancer. However, many chemoresistant cancer cells often develop a relatively higher threshold for inducing apoptosis, causing a limited efficacy of anti-cancer drugs. Likewise, lung cancer cells acquire chemoresistance against CPT analogs, such as irinotecan and topotecan, finally resulting in an unsatisfied outcome and poor prognosis of lung cancer patients. TFPP is a quinone-containing compound as a candidate for CPT-based combination chemotherapy. In this study, we examined the effect of TFPP and CPT cotreatment on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Cell proliferation and flow cytometry-based Annexin-V/PI staining assays demonstrated the synergistic effect of TFPP on CPT-induced apoptosis in both NSCLC A549 and H1299 cells. The results of CPT and TFPP cotreatment cause the regulation of the ERK-Bim axis and the activation of mitochondrial-mediated caspase cascade, including caspase-9 and caspase-3. Besides, TFPP significantly enhanced CPT-induced endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the two NSCLC cells. In contrast, the treatment of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), an ROS scavenger, rescues the apoptosis of NSCLC cells induced by TFPP and CPT cotreatment, suggesting that the synergistic effect of TFPP on CPT-induced anti-NSCLC cells is through upregulating ROS production. Consequently, our results suggest that TFPP sensitizes NSCLC towards CPT-based chemotherapy may act through decreasing the apoptosis-initiating threshold. Therefore, TFPP may be a promising chemosensitizer for lung cancer treatment, and the underlying mechanism warrants further.
