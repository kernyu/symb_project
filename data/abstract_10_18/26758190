Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most deadly human malignant diseases and the sixth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in China. Gemcitabine is the only first-line chemotherapeutic agent used for the palliative treatment of patients with PDAC, but chemo-resistance limits their efficacy. Here, we showed that miR-125a was up-regulated in chemo-resistant SW1990GZ cells when compared with SW1990 cells. Over-expression of miR-125a increased the chemo-resistance to gemcitabine in SW1990 cells, while down-regulation of miR-125a in SW1990GZ cells increased chemo-sensitivity to gemcitabine. By using bioinformatics analysis tool (Targetscan), the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of A20 gene was found to be a target of miR-125a. Luciferase reporter assay further confirmed that A20 3'UTR is a direct target of miR-125a. Over-expression of A20 in SW1990 cells increased chemo-sensitivity to gemcitabine, while knockdown of A20 in SW1990 cells promoted the chemo-resistance to gemcitabine. Finally, the expression level of miR-125a in pancreatic cancer tissues from chemo-sensitive patients was significantly lower than that from chemo-resistant patients, and was inversely correlated with the A20 mRNA levels. In conclusion, our results suggest that miR-125a promotes chemo-resistance to gemcitabine in pancreatic cells through targeting A20, which may provide novel therapeutic targets or molecular biomarkers for cancer therapy and improve tumor diagnosis or predictions of therapeutic responses.
