A large number of genes coding for enzymes predicted to synthesize and degrade 3'-5'-cyclic diguanylic acid (c-di-GMP) is found in most bacterial genomes and this dinucleotide emerged as an intracellular signal-controlling bacterial behaviour. An association between high levels of c-di-GMP and antibiotic resistance may be expected because c-di-GMP regulates biofilm formation and this mode of growth leads to enhanced antibiotic resistance. However, a clear understanding of this correlation has not been established. We found that increased levels of c-di-GMP in Pseudomonas aeruginosa improve fitness in the presence of imipenem, even when grown as planktonic cells. P. aeruginosa post-transcriptionally regulates the amounts of five porins in response to c-di-GMP, including OprD, responsible for imipenem uptake. Cells with low c-di-GMP levels are consequently more sensitive to this antibiotic. Main efflux pumps or beta-lactamase genes did not show altered mRNA levels in P. aeruginosa strains with modified different c-di-GMP concentrations. Together, our findings show that c-di-GMP levels modulate fitness of planktonic cultures in the presence of imipenem.
