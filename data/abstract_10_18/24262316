INTRODUCTION: Antibiotic use and misuse are linked to pathogen resistance and, as such, both constitute a public health issue with local, national, and global dimensions. Early studies have shown striking variations in the use of these drugs between Nordic and Mediterranean countries. The aim of the present study was to describe and compare antibiotic prescribing in Primary Care in Denmark and Aragon (a North-eastern Spanish region). METHODS: Outpatient antibiotic prescription data (2010) were obtained from the National Institute for Health Data and Disease Control (Denmark), and the Information System on Medication Consumption in Aragon. The consumption of antibiotics (ATC J01) was analyzed from the prescription rates and the number of defined daily dose (DDD) per 1000 inhabitants/day (DID). RESULTS: The rate of antibiotic prescription in 2010 in Aragon was greater than in Denmark (407 compared to 315 exposed individuals/1000 inhabitants). There were significant differences as regards overall consumption of antibiotics (23.2 DID in Aragon and 17.0 DID in Denmark), as well as the therapeutic group selection. There was an elevated use of broad spectrum penicillins, quinolones and cephalosporins in the Spanish region while, in Denmark, the most-consumed antibiotic was narrow spectrum penicillin. CONCLUSION: The use of antibiotics in the Spanish region is very high, and there are marked differences in the choice of drug between this region and Denmark. Interventions are needed that promote the rational use of these drugs to reduce potential bacterial resistance, and to avoid unnecessary risks to patients.
