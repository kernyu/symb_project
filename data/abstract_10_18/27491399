BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus epidermidis is one of the most multiple resistances to antibiotics in the recent years. Therefore, practically-prescribed antibiotics in the treatment of these strains are not effective. Plant-derived antibacterial is one of the most interesting sources of new therapeutics. The present study was to investigate antibacterial, synergy and modes of action of quercetin and amoxicillin against amoxicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (ARSE). METHODS: The MICs, checkerboard assay, viability curves, cytoplasmic membrane (CM) permeability, enzyme assay, transmission electron microscopy, confocal microscopy and FT-IR microspectroscopy measurement was performed. RESULTS: The MICs of amoxicillin, penicillin, quercetin and kaempferol against all ARSE strains were 16, 200, 256-384 and >1024 mug/mL respectively. Synergistic effects were exhibited on amoxicillin plus quercetin and penicillin plus kaempferol against these strains at FIC index 0.50 and <0.38 respectively. The synergistic activity of quercetin plus amoxicillin was confirmed by the viable count. This combination increased CM permeability, caused marked morphological, peptidoglycan and cytoplasmic membrane damage, increased protein amide I and II, but decreased fatty acid in bacterial cells. The quercetin had an inhibitory activity against beta-lactamase. CONCLUSIONS: So, these findings are the first report that quercetin has the synergistic effect with amoxicillin against ARSE via four modes of actions, inhibit peptidoglycan synthesis and beta-lactamases activity, increase CM permeability and protein amide I and II but decrease fatty acid in bacterial cells. Of course, this flavonol has the dominant potential to develop a brand-new collateral phytochemical agent plus amoxicillin to treat ARSE. Future work should focus on the bioavailability, efficacy and toxicity in animal and human studies, as well as, the synergistic effect on blood and tissue should be evaluated and achieved.
