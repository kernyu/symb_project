The emergence of bacterial resistance and the lack of new antibiotics in the pipeline represent a public health priority. Maximizing the quality of antibiotic prescriptions is therefore of major importance in terms of adequate preparation and administration modalities. Adequate preparation prevents the inactivation of antibiotics and is a prerequisite to maximizing their efficacy (taking into account the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship) and to minimizing their toxicity. Many antibiotic guidelines address the choice of drugs and treatment duration but none of them exclusively address preparation and administration modalities. These guidelines are based on the available literature and offer essential data for a proper antibiotic preparation and administration by physicians and nurses. They may lead to a better efficacy and to a reduced antibiotic resistance. Such guidelines also contribute to a proper use of drugs and improve the interaction between inpatient and outpatient care for a better overall management of patients.
