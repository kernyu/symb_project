Aspergillosis remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The spectrum of disease is diverse and ranges from noninvasive disease with an excessive immune response, such as in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), to a lack of an immune response as seen in patients with quantitative or qualitative granulocyte deficits and subsequent invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Noninvasive diagnostic testing has improved the time to initiation of effective antifungal therapy, and numerous agents in different therapeutic classes are now available as treatment options. Voriconazole remains the preferred agent in the treatment of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, and recent data have increased interest in the potential of combination therapy against this often lethal infection. The role of host genetics in selecting patients that may benefit from more aggressive antifungal prophylaxis or treatment practices remains unclear but is likely to guide therapeutic choices as newer data become available.
