Antibiotic prophylaxis for laboring women with the intent of protecting newborns from group B strep (GBS) infection carries substantial risks and ethical shortcomings. GBS has been proven to be developing resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin. We are now seeing evidence of its resistance to penicillin, the recommended drug used in the prophylactic protocol. Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is linked to increased virulence of the bacteria. Considering the fact that robust bacterial flora throughout the body is essential to the health and well-being of new mothers and the bacterial colonization of their babies, perhaps the prophylactic use of antibiotics needs to be reconsidered.
