Devil's club Oplopanax horridus (DC) is a close relative of ginseng; its inner root and stem bark extract showed antiproliferation activity on human leukemia, ovarian, breast and colon cancer cells. We study here the effects of DC 70% ethanol extract alone, or in combination with cisplatin, gemcitabine, and paclitaxel on pancreatic endocrine HP62 and pancreatic ductal carcinoma PANC-1 and BxPC-3 cells. Antiproliferation activity assay, cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry, apoptosis-related markers by antibody array, and RT-PCR assay were used for this study. DC extract inhibited proliferation of HP62 with IC50 (50% inhibition concentration) at 0.037+/-0.002% (v/v), PANC-1 at 0.0058 +/- 0.0004% and BxPC-3 at 0.021 +/- 0.003%. DC at 0.0033% combined with 1 nM of paclitaxel showed inhibition synergy on PANC-1 cells with a combination index of 0.44. Apoptosis focused antibody array profile indicated upregulation of cytochrome C, claspin, cIAP-2 and HTRA2/Omi apoptosis-related markers in DC-treated HP62 and PANC-1. Our data suggest that DC acts through targeting the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in the pancreatic cancer cells. The high antiproliferation potency of DC on PANC-1 is potentially useful as an adjunct therapy for treating pancreatic cancer, which is known for developing resistance to conventional chemotherapeutics.
