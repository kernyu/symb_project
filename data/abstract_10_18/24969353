Helicobacter pylori is the major cause of chronic gastritis and peptic ulcers. Since the classification as a group 1 carcinogenic by International Agency for Research on Cancer, the importance of the complete H. pylori eradication has obtained a novel meaning. Hence, several studies have been made in order to deepen the knowledge in therapy strategies. However, the current therapy presents unsatisfactory eradication rates due to the lack of therapeutic compliance, antibiotic resistance, the degradation of antibiotics at gastric pH and their insufficient residence time in the stomach. Novel approaches have been made in order to overcome these limitations. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview about the current therapy and its limitations, while highlighting the possibility of using micro- and nanotechnology to develop gastric drug delivery systems, overcoming these difficulties in the future.
