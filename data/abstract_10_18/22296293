In the present study, we examined the toxicity of benzyl ITC (BITC) and its urinary mercapturic acid metabolite (BITC-NAC), using a normal renal proximal tubular cell line, pig LLC-PK1. BITC increased cell death with an IC(50) value of about 7 muM, whereas the cytotoxic effect of BITC-NAC was five times weaker than that of BITC. We observed a significant necrosis of the compounds on LLC-PK1 cells with oxidative stress. In the presence of 5 mM glutathione (GSH), comparable to physiological levels, the cytotoxicity of BITC-NAC as well as BITC was significantly reduced. Furthermore, the increase in intracellular GSH levels by pretreatment with NAC before the BITC treatment resulted in inhibition of the BITC-induced necrotic events as well as intracellular oxidative stress. These results suggest that GSH is a determinant of cellular resistance against the BITC-mediated and oxidative stress-dependent cytotoxicity in renal proximal tubular cells.
