Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection can cause pneumonia, particularly in children. Global increase in macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae is of concern due to limited therapeutic options. We describe the detection of macrolide resistance-conferring mutations in 9.3% of 43 clinical specimens where M. pneumoniae was detected in England and Wales from September 2014September 2015. This study aims to impact by highlighting the presence of macrolide resistance in M. pneumoniae positive patients, promoting increased clinical vigilance.
