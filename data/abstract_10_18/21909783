Forty-three epidemiologically unrelated emerging Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar 4,[5],12:i:- strains isolated during the period 2009-2010 in Slovakia were characterized by phenotypic and genotypic methods. Thirty-one isolates (72.1%) expressed resistance to ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfizoxazole, and tetracycline [R-type ASSuT]. The majority of the strains belonged to both definitive phage types DT193 (30.2%) and U311 (27.9%). Other phage types identified were U302 (6.9%), DT18 (4.7%), and DT194 (2.3%). Twelve strains (27.9%) were not typeable. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis identified three closely related major banding profiles (X1, X1a, and X2), suggesting the similarity and close epidemiological relationship between S. enterica serovar 4,[5],12:i:- strains. In two isolates with R-type ASSuT, phage type NT and in one isolate with R-type ACROSSuSxTTTMPNA, phage type DT193 class 1 integrons were found encoding bla(PSE-1) and dfrA, aadA1, respectively.
