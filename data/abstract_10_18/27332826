Failed eradication of Helicobacter pylori occurs when the antibiotic concentration at the site where H. pylori is located is lower than the minimal inhibitory concentration of the antibiotic for this bacterium. The main reason for this is the acquisition of resistance; and in the context of the most common treatment, the main reason is the acquisition of resistance to clarithromycin. Several options can then be followed. The most rational option is to use a tailored therapy, that is, to look for clarithromycin resistance either by culture plus antibiogram or by a molecular method. The standard triple therapy is used only in the case of clarithromycin susceptibility. In case of resistance or if an empiric treatment must be given, a good option is to use a bismuth-based quadruple therapy. If unavailable, clarithromycin-based quadruple therapies can be used either as sequential or 'concomitant' or hybrid. The limit, especially for concomitant therapy, is the use of clarithromycin, which will be inactive in about 2/3 of the cases, adding to cost and adverse events. Recently, the dual therapy proton pump inhibitor-amoxicillin has been revisited especially in the Far East, and increasing the dose and the frequency of administration gives excellent results.
