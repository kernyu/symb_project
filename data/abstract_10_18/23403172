Antibiotic resistance is a well-acknowledged crisis with no clearly defined comprehensive, national corrective plan. We propose a number of interventions that, collectively, could make a large difference. These include collection of data to inform decisions, efforts to reduce antibiotic abuse in people and animals, great emphasis on antibiotic stewardship, performance incentives, optimal use of newer diagnostics, better support for clinical and basic resistance-related research, and novel methods to foster new antibiotic development.
