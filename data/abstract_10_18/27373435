OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the effects of S-allylcysteine (SAC) on biomarkers of the polyol pathway in streptozotocin-nicotinamide (STZ-NA)-induced diabetes in rats. METHODS: Diabetes was induced in male albino Wistar rats by intraperitoneal administration of STZ (55 mg kg(-1) bw(-1)) and NA (110 mg kg(-1) bw(-1)). SAC (150 mg kg(-1) bw(-1)) was orally administered to the rats with diabetes for 45 days to assess its effects on blood glucose, insulin, insulin resistance, glycated hemoglobin, aldose reductase (AR), sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH), sorbitol, fructose, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), hydroperoxide, hemoglobin and glutathione (GSH). RESULTS: On SAC administration in the rats with diabetes, the levels of blood glucose, insulin resistance, glycated hemoglobin, AR, SDH, sorbitol, fructose, TBARS and hydroperoxide increased significantly (p<0.05), whereas those of insulin, hemoglobin and GSH decreased. SAC showed therapeutic effects similar to those of gliclazide in decreasing blood glucose, AR, SDH, sorbitol, fructose, glycosylated hemoglobin, TBARS and hydroperoxides levels and significant increases in insulin, hemoglobin and GSH activity in rats with diabetes. Moreover, histopathologic studies also revealed the protective effect of SAC on pancreatic beta cells. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that SAC prevents complications of diabetes by reducing the influx of glucose in the polyol pathway, thereby elevating the GSH level and reducing the activities of AR and SDH. Therefore, SAC may have imperative implications for the deterrence and early treatment of type 2 diabetes.
