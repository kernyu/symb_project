This report describes the first identification of OXA-24 carbapenemase-producing Acinetobacter baumannii isolates from Bulgaria. According to national surveillance data A. baumannii along with Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most troublesome microorganisms in hospital environment with high rates of acquired carbapenem resistance. In the present study real-time multiplex PCR was performed to identify the most common carbapenemase genes in 15 non-duplicate carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii isolates collected in 2012. The results showed lack of KPC, GES, VIM, IMP-type enzymes. Four A. baumannii isolates tested positive by PCR for the acquired OXA-24 together with the intrinsic OXA-51 carbapenemase. OXA-24 and OXA-23 were determined as co-existent in one isolate. Two isolates were identified with OXA-23 in addition to the OXA-51 carbapenemase.
