Hormographiella aspergillata is a rare causative agent of invasive filamentous breakthrough infection, mostly arising after echinocandin exposure. We report a neutropenic patient who developed a severe sino-orbito-cerebral H. aspergillata infection while receiving empirical caspofungin, successfully controlled by an aggressive strategy associating surgical debridement and combined high-dose regimen of antifungal drugs.
