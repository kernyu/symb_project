Malaria is the most important parasitic disease, leading to annual death of about one million people, and the Plasmodium falciparum develops resistance to well-established antimalarial drugs. The newest antiplasmodial drug from a marine microorganism helps in addressing this problem. In the present study, Haliclona Grant were collected and subjected for enumeration and isolation of associated bacteria. The count of bacterial isolates was maximum in November 2007 (18 x 10(4) colony-forming units (CFU) g(-1), and the average count was maximum during the monsoon season (117 x 10(3) CFU g(-1)). Thirty-three morphologically different bacterial isolates were isolated from Haliclona Grant, and the extracellular ethyl acetate extracts were screened for antiplasmodial activity against P. falciparum. The antiplasmodial activity of bacterium RJAUTHB 14 (11.98 mug[Symbol: see text]ml(-1)) is highly comparable with the positive control chloroquine (IC(50) 19.59 mug[Symbol: see text]ml(-1)), but the other 21 bacterial extracts showed an IC(50) value of more than 100 mug[Symbol: see text]ml(-1). Statistical analysis reveals that significant in vitro antiplasmodial activity (P < 0.05) was observed between the concentrations and time of exposure. The chemical injury to erythrocytes showed no morphological changes in erythrocytes by the ethyl acetate extract of bacterial isolates after 48 h of incubation. The in vitro antiplasmodial activity might be due to the presence of reducing sugars and alkaloids in the ethyl acetate extracts of bacterium RJAUTHB 14. The 16S rRNA gene partial sequence of bacterium RJAUTHB 14 is deposited in NCBI (GenBank accession no. GU269569). It is concluded from the present study that the ethyl acetate extracts of bacterium RJAUTHB 14 possess lead compounds for the development of antiplasmodial drugs.
