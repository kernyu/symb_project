OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBLs) and carbapenemase-encoding genes in poultry from Algeria and Marseille, France. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The samples consisted of feces from broilers from France and Algeria between 2014 and 2015. DNA extraction and quantitative PCR were performed on 833 fecal samples to screen for the presence of ESBLs (TEM, SHV, CTX-M) and carbapenemase-encoding genes (NDM, OXA48, OXA58). In order to characterize the bacteria carrying antimicrobial resistance, positive results were simultaneously sequenced. RESULTS: All chicken feces from Marseille were negative for ESBLs and carbapenemase-encoding genes. However, of the 503 fecal samples collected in Algeria, 128/503 (25.4%) were positive for BlaTEM 83/503 (16.5%) for BlaSHV, 46/503 (9.1%) for BlaCTX-M and 132/503 (26.2%) were positive for BlaOXA58. Using a sequencing reaction, we obtained a high diversity of ESBL genes throughout the sites studied. CONCLUSION: Our study shows a high prevalence and diversity of ESBLs and carbapenemase genes in the feces of poultry from Algeria, whereas none of the samples from Marseille were positive. The high prevalence of ESBLs in Algeria contrasts that no chickens were found to be positive in France.
