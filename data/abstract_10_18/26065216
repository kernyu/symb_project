One of the major issues medical institutions deal with is hospital acquired infections (HAI's) and the invasion of antibiotic resistant organisms into these institutions. Antibiotic resistance influences morbidity, mortality and costs. In order to effectively manage the field of infection control of HAI's we constructed computerized clinical tools. Via commercial computerized systems (MetaVision IMDSOFT, Israel) we created tools that facilitated transferring information and process infection control measures. We found that characterization and implementation of accurate tools in the clinical computerized system improves our work and effectiveness, and they are therefore utilized on a daily basis to manage infection control in Assuta Medical Centers.
