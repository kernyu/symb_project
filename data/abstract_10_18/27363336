Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have robust systems to maintain cancer stemness and drug resistance. Thus, targeting such robust systems instead of focusing on individual signaling pathways should be the approach allowing the identification of selective CSC inhibitors. Here, we used the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assay to identify inhibitors for cancer stemness in induced cancer stem-like (iCSCL) cells. We screened several compounds from natural product chemical library and evaluated hit compounds for their efficacy on cancer stemness in iCSCL tumorspheres. We identified artesunate, an antimalarial drug, as a selective inhibitor of cancer stemness. Artesunate induced mitochondrial dysfunction that selectively inhibited cancer stemness of iCSCL cells, indicating an essential role of mitochondrial metabolism in cancer stemness.
