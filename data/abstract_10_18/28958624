Design, synthesis, and evaluation of a new class of HIV-1 protease inhibitors containing diverse flexible macrocyclic P1'-P2' tethers are reported. Inhibitor 5a with a pyrrolidinone-derived macrocycle exhibited favorable enzyme inhibitory and antiviral activity (Ki=13.2nM, IC50=22nM). Further incorporation of heteroatoms in the macrocyclic skeleton provided macrocyclic inhibitors 5m and 5o. These compounds showed excellent HIV-1 protease inhibitory (Ki=62pM and 14pM, respectively) and antiviral activity (IC50=5.3nM and 2.0nM, respectively). Inhibitor 5o also remained highly potent against a DRV-resistant HIV-1 variant.
