Metals play a critical role in life processes, and metal-based drugs nowadays have been commonly used for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. However, severe side-effects and acquired drug resistance are the major issues needing to be resolved prior to more effective metallodrugs being developed, which requires a full understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms. Metallomic and metalloproteomic approaches have received growing attention and have been implemented in inorganic medicinal chemistry and chemical biology in the endeavor to expand our knowledge of the pharmacological profiles, potential targets and functional pathways of metallodrugs. This perspective summarizes some recent progress in using metallomic and metalloproteomic strategies to elucidate the mechanisms of action of representative anticancer and antimicrobial metal-based drugs and agents.
