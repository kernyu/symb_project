Chloroquine (CQ), the first cost-effective synthetic antimalarial, is rendered ineffective in malaria-endemic regions owing to the rise and spread of CQ-resistant Plasmodium falciparum. In this report, we show that a halogen derivative of CQ, namely 3-iodo-CQ, inhibits the proliferation of CQ-sensitive and -resistant P. falciparum in a verapamil-insensitive manner. Similar to CQ, the antimalarial activity of 3-iodo-CQ is likely due to its inhibition of beta-haematin formation. Interestingly, the presence of non-inhibitory concentrations of 3-iodo-CQ potentiated the antiproliferative activity of CQ against CQ-resistant strains or P. falciparum transfectants expressing wild-type or mutant P. falciparum CQ resistance transporter (PfCRT) (C2(GC03) or C4(Dd2), respectively). These findings demonstrate that halogenation of the third position of 4-aminoquinoline, with a simple one-step reaction from CQ, generates a novel derivative that is active against CQ-sensitive and -resistant P. falciparum, possibly by inhibiting the activity of mutant PfCRT.
