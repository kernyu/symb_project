The class A beta-lactamase GES-22 has been identified in Acinetobacter baumannii isolates in Turkey, and subsequently shown to differ from GES-11 by a single substitution (M169L). Because M169 is part of the omega loop, a structure that is known to have major effects on substrate selectivity in class A beta-lactamases, we expressed, purified and kinetically characterized this novel variant. Our results show that compared with GES-11(6 x His), GES-22(6 x His) displays more efficient hydrolysis of penicillins, and aztreonam, but a loss of efficiency against ceftazidime. In addition, the M169L substitution confers on GES-22 more efficient hydrolysis of the mechanistic inhibitors clavulanic acid and sulbactam. These effects are highly similar to other mutations at the homologous position in other class A beta-lactamases, suggesting that this methionine has a key structural role in aligning active site residues and in substrate selectivity across the class.
