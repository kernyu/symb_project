The fish pathogenic oomycete Aphanomyces invadans is the causative agent of epizootic ulcerative syndrome (EUS), a fish disease of international significance and reportable to the World Organisation for Animal Health. In spite of the current and potential impact of A. invadans infection on fisheries and aquaculture sectors of the world, very little is known about the host-A. invadans interactions. In the present study, following experimental infection with A. invadans in one of the Indian major carps, Labeo rohita, sequential changes in various innate immune parameters were monitored. The results indicated that at early stages of infection, no significant changes in any of the studied innate immune parameters were observed. However, at the advanced stages of infection from 6 to 12 days post infection (dpi), the respiratory burst and alternate complement activity were significantly higher whereas lysozyme, antiproteases and alpha-2 macroglobulin values were significantly lower than the control group and also from the infected group at earlier stages of infection. Since, the possibility of vaccination of fish against A. invadans appears remote due to difficulties in eliciting a specific antibody response, the information generated in the present study could be useful for developing strategies for improving resistance to A. invadans infection by stimulating the innate immunity through immunomodulation.
