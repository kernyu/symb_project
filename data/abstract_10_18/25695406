Influenza is an important cause of annual epidemics of respiratory viral infection associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Three classes of drugs, the M2 ion channel, neuraminidase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors, are approved for the prevention and treatment of influenza. Due to widespread resistance to the class, the M2 ion channel inhibitors are not recommended currently for therapy. The only polymerase inhibitor, favipiravir, is approved only in Japan and its use is highly restricted. Despite significant data to support the early use of the neuraminidase inhibitors, their use in all patient populations is suboptimal. The data to support the early use of neuraminidase inhibitors will be reviewed, as will current data on the utilization rates in ambulatory and hospitalized populations.
