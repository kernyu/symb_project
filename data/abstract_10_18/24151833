Up until 10 years ago, basic and clinical HIV-1 research was mainly performed on HIV-1 subtype B that predominated in resource-rich settings. Over the past decade, HIV-1 care and therapy has been scaled up substantially in Latin America, Africa and Asia. These regions are largely dominated by non-B subtype infections, and especially the African continent is affected by the HIV pandemic. Insight on the potency of antiviral drugs and regimens as well as on the emergence of drug resistance in non-B subtypes was lacking triggering research in this field, also partly driven by the introduction and spreading of HIV-1 non-B subtypes in Europe. The scope of this article was to review and discuss the state-of-the-art on the impact of HIV-1 genetic variation on the in vitro activity of antiviral drugs and in vivo response to antiviral therapy; as well as on the in vitro and in vivo emergence of drug resistance.
