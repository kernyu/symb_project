Budding yeast is often used in chemical genetics for screening, target identification, and compound verification, but its high-level drug resistance has made the analysis of compounds difficult. Here we report the construction of 12geneDelta0HSR, a strain that lacks eight efflux pumps located on the plasma membrane and four transcription factors involved in expression of efflux pumps, and contains the RME1(ins-308A) mutation. This strain retained sufficient transformation, mating, and sporulation efficiency for genetic analysis in addition to hypersensitivity against several compounds. 12geneDelta0HSR is a useful tool for chemical biology, not only in chemical screening but in target identification and verification of bioactive compounds.
