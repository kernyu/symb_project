OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of 104-week sequential therapy with telbivudine or entecavir in HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with suboptimal responses to 24-week pegylated interferon-alpha-2a (PEG-IFN-alpha-2a) therapy. METHODS: A total of 130 HBeAg-positive CHB patients with HBV DNA>/=5.0 lg IU/ml and a reduction in HBsAg quantitation < 1 lg IU/ml compared with baseline who received PEG-IFN-alpha-2a therapy for 24 weeks were enrolled and randomly divided into telbivudine group and entecavir group, and 5 of them were lost. HBeAg clearance rate and seroconversion rate, HBV DNA clearance rate, safety, and drug resistance rate at week 104 were observed. The t-test, chi-square test, or multivariate Cox regression analysis were used for statistical analysis of different types of data. RESULTS: At week 104 of treatment, HBV DNA clearance rate showed no significant difference between the telbivudine group and entecavir group (P = 0.363), and the telbivudine group had significantly higher HBeAg clearance rate and HBeAg seroconversion rate than the entecavir group (HBeAg clearance rate: 61.29% vs 23.81%, P < 0.01; HBeAg seroconversion rate: 51.61% vs 19.05%, P < 0.01). Male sex and telbivudine therapy were baseline predictors of HBeAg seroconversion. The multivariate Cox regression analysis (Forward LR, a = 0.05) showed that the presence or absence of HBeAg seroconversion at week 104 was significantly associated with male sex (HR = 4.917), a reduction in HBsAg > 0.5 lg IU/ml at week 12 of treatment compared baseline (HR = 3.514), and a reduction in HBeAg > 1 lg COI at week 12 of treatment compared baseline (HR = 8.651). CONCLUSION: In HBeAg-positive CHB patients with suboptimal responses to 24-week PEG-IFNalpha-2a therapy, the sequential therapy with telbivudine helps achieve better HBeAg clearance rate and seroconversion rate compared with the sequential therapy with entecavir and can be used as a therapeutic regimen for such patients. A reduction in HBeAg > 1 lg COI at week 12 of treatment compared baseline can be used as a predictive factor for HBeAg seroconversion at week 104.
