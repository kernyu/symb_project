To evaluate the clinical impact of multiple-drug resistance in burn patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) bacteremia. A retrospective cohort study in a 10-bed burn intensive care unit (BICU) was performed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to analyze the influence of multiple-drug resistance on mortality and length of BICU stay in Pa bacteremic patients. During a 21-year study period (1989-2009), 87 patients with Pa bacteremia were identified; 45 patients had multiple-drug resistant (MDR) strains and 42 susceptible strains. On comparison of the two populations, one with multiple-drug resistant strains and the other with the susceptible strains, the following parameters were found to be significantly different in the univariate analysis: age (32.7 vs 43.6 years; P = .013), sex (males: 91.1 vs 66.7%; P = .005), intubation status on admission (75.6 vs. 54.8%; P = .041), escharotomy (57.8 vs 33.3%; P = .022), burn size (51.0 vs 35.3% of TBSA; P = .002) and Abbreviated Burn Severity Index score (9.2 vs 8.1; P = .048). In terms of outcome parameters, multiple-drug resistance was not significantly related to mortality (adjusted odds ratio 1.076; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.356-3.254; P = .897) and length of BICU stay after Pa bacteremia (Kaplan-Meier analysis log-rank test P = .945; Cox's proportional hazards regression hazards ratio, 0.994; 95% CI 0.513-1.925; P = .985) in the univariate and multivariate analyses. The data from this study suggest that multiple-drug resistance is not associated with significant increases in mortality and length of BICU stay among burn patients with Pa bacteremia.
