The purpose of this study was to quantify the biofilm formations of various methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clones (ST1, ST5, ST72, ST89, ST239, and ST254) and to evaluate the in vitro activities of antibiotics. Of 86 MRSA isolates tested, 44 isolates (51.2 %) formed biofilms, including 8 strong biofilm producers (7 isolates of ST72 and 1 isolate of ST89). The planktonic MICs, minimal bactericidal concentrations, and minimum biofilm eradication concentrations (MBECs) of 6 antibiotics (clindamycin, gentamicin, linezolid, vancomycin, daptomycin, and tigecycline) were measured for 8 MRSA isolates. The planktonic isolates were susceptible to all agents, with daptomycin being the most effective, followed by gentamicin and vancomycin. However, clindamycin, linezolid, and tigecycline showed bacteriostatic activity against most of the isolates. The biofilms were resistant to high concentrations of most drugs. However, the MBEC values of daptomycin and tigecycline were lower overall than that of other antibiotics. Microscopy studies verified that daptomycin was the most effective drug used in adhesive biofilms, while gentamicin and tigecycline exhibited some bactericidal efficacy. Our results demonstrated that ST72 and ST89 form strong biofilms that may cause problems in hospital setting, and daptomycin, gentamicin, and tigecycline may be choice therapeutics against biofilm-mediated S. aureus infections.
