Mycobacterium tuberculosis arylamine N-acetyltransferase (TBNAT) is able to acetylate para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) both in vitro and in vivo as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) techniques. The antituberculosis activity of the acetylated PAS is significantly reduced. As a result, overexpression of TBNAT in M. tuberculosis results in PAS resistance, as determined by MIC tests and drug exposure experiments. Taken together, our results suggest that TBNAT from M. tuberculosis is able to inactivate PAS by acetylating the compound.
