Abundant mycolic acids are the hallmark of the mycobacterial cell wall. The biosynthesis of mycolic acids fulfilled by type I (Fas-I) and type II (Fas-II) synthase systems necessitates long chain fatty acids as the raw material. Fas-I is responsible for de novo fatty acid synthesis to form fatty acids 16-24 carbons in length and then elongated by the monofunctional enzymes of Fas-II to form long chain fatty acids, and further to form mycolic acids. Mutation of monofunctional enzymes can confer mycobacterial drug resistance. The key monofunctional enzymes of this system might represent new drug target candidates for antituberculosis drug development.
