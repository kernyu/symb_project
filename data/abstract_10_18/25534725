There is a growing need for biocompatible, broad-spectrum, nonantibiotic, antimicrobial treatments because of the frequent ineffectiveness of antibiotics against biofilms and the increasing incidence of antibiotic resistance. In this study, we demonstrate rapid and complete biofilm eradication in an in vitro model with synergistic combinations of glyceryl trinitrate and caprylic acid against resistant Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and fungal biofilms.
