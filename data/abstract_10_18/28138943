Identifying transmission route of antimicrobial-resistant pathogen is essential for appropriate infection control strategy in healthcare facilities. We report the utility of single-nucleotide variation analysis in tracing nosocomial transmission of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens by describing a pseudo-outbreak case of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. The present case highlights that infection control strategy should encompass pathological dissection rooms, neglected but potentially highly contaminated places in hospitals.
