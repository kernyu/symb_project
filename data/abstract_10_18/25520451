The high frequency of fluoroquinolone resistance in Escherichia coli is a feature of clinical bacteriology in China, where the molecular epidemiology and genetic characteristics of this resistance in county hospitals remain unclear. A total of 590 nonduplicate E. coli isolates from 30 county hospitals located across seven Chinese regions were examined for plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes and mutations in quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs). Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and phylogenetic analysis of fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates were used to determine their genetic relatedness. The ciprofloxacin resistance rate of community-onset E. coli was 51.2%, and at least one PMQR gene was carried by 220 (37.3%) isolates. These included qnr (3.7%), aac(6')-Ib-cr (19.7%), qepA (14.4%), and oqxAB (3.8%). Two novel oqxB mutants were identified and named oqxB20 and oqxB29. From 60 sequence types (STs) isolated, 5 novel STs (ST4499 to ST4503) were identified. ST1193 (7.9%) was the second most abundant ST among fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates (ST131 was the most common, with 14.6%), and this is the first report of it in China. This is also the first report of ST2115 and ST3014 isolates from human samples. Ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli isolates fell mainly into phylogroups B2 and D. The rates of fluoroquinolone resistance and the prevalence of PMQR genes in community-onset E. coli isolates from Chinese county hospitals were high. The wide-ranging molecular epidemiology of E. coli isolates from scattered locations across China indicates that fluoroquinolone resistance evolved from different sources.
