BACKGROUND: The eradication rates of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) using a proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-based triple therapy have declined due to antibiotic resistance worldwide. AIM: To compare the eradication rate of the 10-day sequential therapy for H. pylori infection with that of the 14-day standard PPI-based triple therapy. METHODS: This was a prospective, randomised, controlled study. A total of 409 patients with H. pylori infection were randomly assigned to receive either the 10-day sequential therapy regimen, which consisted of pantoprazole (40 mg) plus amoxicillin (1000 mg) twice a day for 5 days, then pantoprazole (40 mg) with clarithromycin (500 mg) and metronidazole (500 mg) twice a day for another five consecutive days or the 14-day PPI-based triple therapy regimen, which consisted of pantoprazole (40 mg) with amoxicillin (1000 mg) and clarithromycin (500 mg) twice a day for 14 days. The pre- and post-treatment H. pylori status were assessed by rapid urease test, urea breath test, or histology. Successful eradication was confirmed at least 4 weeks after finishing the treatment. RESULTS: In the intention-to-treat analysis, the eradication rates of the 10-day sequential therapy and of the 14-day PPI-based triple therapy were 85.9% (176/205) and 75.0% (153/205), respectively (P = 0.006). In the per-protocol analysis, the eradication rates were 92.6% (175/205) and 85% (153/204), respectively (P = 0.019). There was no statistically significant difference between the two investigated groups regarding the occurrence of adverse event rates (18.9% vs. 13.3%, P = 0.143). CONCLUSION: The 10-day sequential therapy achieved significantly higher eradication rates than the 14-day standard PPI-based triple therapy in Korea.
