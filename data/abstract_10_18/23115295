Transmission of drug-resistant HIV has been postulated to be a threat to current first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens and the efficacy of several antiretroviral-based preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) strategies being tested. Here we evaluated the effect of the common tenofovir (TFV) resistance mutation K65R on vaginal HIV transmission. Our results demonstrate that despite no overt loss of overall replication competence in vivo, this mutation results in significantly reduced mucosal transmission. When transmitted, the mutant virus eventually reverted to the wild type in 2 of 3 animals examined.
