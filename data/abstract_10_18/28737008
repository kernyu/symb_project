The emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains is particularly important in chronic pathologies such as cystic fibrosis (CF), in which persistent colonization and selection of resistant strains is favored by the frequent and repeated use of antibacterial agents. Staphylococcus aureus is a common pathogen in CF patients that has an associated increased multidrug resistance. In previous studies we demonstrated that the presence of a 4-alkylidene side chain directly linked to a beta-lactam appeared to strengthen the potency against S. aureus, especially against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains. In the present study, 21 new 4-alkylidene-beta-lactams were synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial activity. We designed the new compounds to have aryl, benzyl, or phenethyl-carbamate groups on the C3 hydroxyethyl side chain. We found a correlation between biological activity and the nitrogen substituent of the carbamate group, and two phenethyl-carbamate beta-lactams were shown to be valuable antibacterial agents against selected linezolid-resistant strains, with a minimum inhibitory concentrations of 2-4 mg L(-1) .
