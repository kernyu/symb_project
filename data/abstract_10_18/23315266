Standardized methodology for drug susceptibility testing of second line drugs is vital for treatment of multi/extensively drug resistant tuberculosis. Discrepancy between laboratory methods and clinical interpretation is well established for bacteriostatic drugs such as ethionamide. Optimization of the standard proportion sensitivity testing (PST) method for ethionamide was under taken in 235 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from new and previously treated pulmonary tuberculosis patients. An additional higher concentration of 57 mug/ml was evaluated against at the standard 40 mug/ml concentration in PST method. Performance parameters and agreement between the two drug concentrations was higher indicating the efficiency of PST method at its present format at 40 mug/ml and additional higher concentration of 57 mug/ml as an alternative when required.
