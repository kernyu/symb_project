Antibiotics with novel mechanisms of action are urgently needed. Processes of cellular division are attractive targets for new drug development. FtsZ, an integral protein involved in cell cytokinesis, is a representative example. In the present study, the pharmacodynamic (PD) activity of an FtsZ inhibitor, TXA-709, and its active metabolite, TXA-707, was evaluated in the neutropenic murine thigh infection model against 5 Staphylococcus aureus isolates, including both methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant isolates. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of the TXA-707 active metabolite were examined after oral administration of the TXA-709 prodrug at 10, 40, and 160 mg/kg of body weight. The half-life ranged from 3.2 to 4.4 h, and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum concentration of drug in serum (Cmax) were relatively linear over the doses studied. All organisms exhibited an MIC of 1 mg/liter. Dose fractionation demonstrated the area under the concentration-time curve over 24 h in the steady state divided by the MIC (AUC/MIC ratio) to be the PD index most closely linked to efficacy (R(2) = 0.72). Dose-dependent activity was demonstrated against all 5 isolates, and the methicillin-resistance phenotype did not alter the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) targets. Net stasis was achieved against all isolates and a 1-log10 kill level against 4 isolates. PD targets included total drug 24-h AUC/MIC values of 122 for net stasis and 243 for 1-log10 killing. TXA-709 and TXA-707 are a promising novel antibacterial class and compound for S. aureus infections. These results should prove useful for design of clinical dosing regimen trials.
