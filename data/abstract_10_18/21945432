Although gemcitabine is recognized as the standard drug for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer, the clinical outcome is not satisfactory. We recently reported that relatively high dose ultraviolet-C (UV-C; 200J) inhibits cell growth by desensitization of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in human pancreatic cancer cells. In the present study, we investigated the combination effects of low dose UV-C (10J) and gemcitabine on apoptosis and cell growth in these cells. UV-C enhanced gemcitabine-induced suppression of cell viability. In addition, the combination use clearly induced apoptosis, while neither UV-C nor gemcitabine alone did. Concurrently, combination use caused the decrease in the EGFR protein level and reduced EGF-induced activation of Akt pathway, subsequently resulting in accumulation of beta-catenin. The order of the treatment with UV-C and gemcitabine did not affect their synergistic effects on apoptosis and cell growth. Interestingly, combination use synergistically induced phosphorylation of 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) alpha at Thr172 and acetyl-CoA carboxylase at Ser79 as a downstream molecular target of AMPK. AMPK activator, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-riboside, induced apoptosis and suppressed cell growth in these cells, thus suggesting that combination effects of UV-C and gemcitabine is due to the activation of AMPK. Together, our findings could provide a new aspect of pancreatic cancer therapy.
