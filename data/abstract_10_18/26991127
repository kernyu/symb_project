INTRODUCTION: Gemcitabine-based regimens represent the standard systemic first line treatment in patients after pancreatic resection. However, the clinical impact of gemcitabine varies significantly in individuals because of chemoresistance. An in vitro adenosine triphosphate based chemotherapy response assay (ATP-CRA) was designed to evaluate the sensitivity of cancer cells to various chemotherapeutic agents. This study investigated the correlation between in vitro gemcitabine sensitivity of tumor cells and early recurrence after curative resection. METHOD: From January 2007 to December 2010, the ATP-CRA for gemcitabine was tested in 64 patients surgically treated for pancreas cancer at Gangnam Severance Hospital, Seoul, Korea. We analyzed the relationship between chemosensitivity and early systemic recurrence in patients with pancreas cancer to predict disease-free survival (DFS) after curative resection in pancreas cancer. RESULT: The mean cell death rate (CDR) was 20.0 (+/-14.5) and divided into two groups according to the mean values of the CDR. Lymphovascular invasion was more frequently shown in gemcitabine resistance group without statistical significance. In univariate and multivariate analysis, advanced tumor stage and gemcitabine sensitive group (CDR >/= 20) were identified as independent prognostic factors for DFS. CONCLUSIONS: Gemcitabine sensitivity measured by ATP-CRA was well correlated with in vivo drug responsibility to predict early recurrence following gemcitabine-based adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with pancreas cancer.
