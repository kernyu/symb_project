Purine and pyrimidine nucleoside and nucleotide analogs have been extensively studied as anticancer and antiviral agents. In addition to this, they have recently shown great potential against Mycobacterium Tuberculosis, the causative agent of TB. TB ranks as the tenth most common cause of death in the world. The current treatment for TB infection is limited by side effects and cost of the drugs and most importantly by the development of resistance to the therapy. Therefore the development of novel drugs, capable of overcoming the drawbacks of the existing treatments, has become the focus of many research programs. In parallel to that, a tremendous effort has been made to elucidate the unique metabolism of this pathogen with the aim to identify new possible targets. This review presents the state of the art in nucleoside and nucleotide analogs in the treatment of TB. In particular, we report on the inhibitory activity of this class of compounds, both in enzymatic and whole-cell assays, providing a brief insight to which reported target these novel compounds are hitting.
