An NDM-1 carbapenemase-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolate was recovered from a patient hospitalized in France after a previous hospitalization in Serbia. Genetic studies revealed that the blaNDM-1 gene was surrounded by insertion sequence ISAba125 and a truncated bleomycin resistance gene. This blaNDM-1 region was a part of the variable region of a new complex class 1 integron bearing IS common region 1 (ISCR1). The presence of ISPa7 upstream of this integron suggests insertion in a chromosomally located Tn402-like structure.
