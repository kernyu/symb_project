BACKGROUND: Shigella species infections coupled with increased levels of antimicrobial resistances are major public health problems in developing countries particularly in children. OBJECTIVES: The present study was conducted to determine the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance pattern of Shigella species among patients with diarrhea at Felege Hiwot Referral Hospital. METHODS: A cross-sectional prospective study was undertaken among patients with diarrhea (n=215) from August to November 2009. A4 pre-tested structured questionnaire was used for collecting data. Stool samples were investigated for identification of Shigella species following standard procedures and antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed using disc diffusion technique. RESULTS: The isolation rate of Shigella species was 32/215 [14.9% (95% CI.: 10.5-20.5)], with high prevalence in patents under five years of age. Educational level, latrine usage, source of drinking water, and hand washing habits showed a statistically significant association with the prevalence of Shigella species (p = 0.004). All isolates of Shigella species were susceptible to ciprofloxacin and high level of sensitivity was observed for norfloxacin (90.6%) and gentamicin (75%). Multiple drug resistance to as many as nine antibiotics was also detected CONCLUSION: High prevalence of Shigella with multiple antibiotic resistance isolates was observed in this study. Public health workers should emphasize, on primary preventive measures and periodic surveillance for antibiotic susceptibility pattern of Shigella isolates. When culturing and antibiotic susceptibility testing facilities are not available, prescription of ciprofloxacin as a choice of treatment is recommended.
