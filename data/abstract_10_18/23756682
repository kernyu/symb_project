KB425796-C is a novel antifungal metabolite produced by the newly isolated bacterial strain Paenibacillus sp. No. 530603. This compound is a 40-membered macrocyclic lipopeptidolactone consisting of 12 amino acids and a 3-hydroxy-15-methylpalmitoyl moiety. KB425796-C displayed antifungal activity against micafungin-resistant fungi and was fungicidal to Trichosporon asahii in vitro. In a murine systemic infection model of T. asahii, KB425796-C showed excellent efficacy upon i.p. administration at 32 mg kg(-1). In addition, KB425796-C induced morphological changes in the hyphae of Aspergillus fumigatus and had fungicidal effects in combination with micafungin. In a mouse model of septic A. fumigatus infection, although non-treated mice survived for a maximum of only 6 days, the survival rate of micafungin-treated mice (0.1 mg kg(-1)) increased to 20%, while the survival rate of mice treated with a combination of micafungin (0.1 mg kg(-1)) and KB425796-C (32 mg kg(-1)) increased to 100% during the 31-day post-infection period. Our findings suggest that KB425796-C is a good candidate for the treatment of aspergillosis in combination with micafungin.
