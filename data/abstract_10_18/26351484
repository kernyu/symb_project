BACKGROUND &OBJECTIVE: Breast cancer is the most common female malignancy. Detection of DNA of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) in breast carcinomas suggests that the virus may play a role in the pathogenesis of this disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of HPVs genotypes 6, 11, 16, 18 and 31 in paraffin-embedded tissue samples of invasive breast carcinomas. METHODS: Three hundred and twenty six paraffin-embedded tissue samples of breast cancer were studied. PCR was performed using specific primers for HPV genotypes. RESULTS: Of total 206 (63.2%) samples positive for Beta-globin gene, 54 (26.2%) were HPV-positive and 152 (73.8%) were negative for HPV. Distribution of HPV genotypes were as follows: 19 (25.7%) were positive for genotype 11, 5 (6.8%) were positive for genotype 6; and 2 cases (2.7%) were positive for both genotypes 6 and 11. Samples were also screened for HPV genotypes 16, 18 and 31 but none was positive. CONCLUSION: The current study confirmed the association of HPV and breast cancer. However, all samples were negative for high-risk HPV types 16, 18 and 31.
