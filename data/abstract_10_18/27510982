The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether quercetin (Que) modulates the mRNA and protein expression levels of drugmetabolizing enzymes (DMEs) and drug transporters (DTs) in the small intestine and liver, and thus modifies the pharmacokinetic profile of cyclosporine (CsA) in rats. This twopart study evaluated the pharmacokinetic profiles of CsA in the presence or absence of Que (experiment I) and the involvement of DMEs and DTs (experiment II). In experiment I, 24 rats received singledose CsA (10 mg/kg) on day 1, singledose Que (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg/day; eight rats in each group) on days 38, and concomitant CsA/Que on day 9. In experiment II, the mRNA and protein expression levels of cytochrome P (CYP)3A1, CYP3A2, UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A complex locus, organic aniontransporting polypeptide (OATP)2B1, OATP1B2, Pglycoprotein, breast cancer resistance protein, and multidrug resistanceassociated protein 2 in the small intestine and liver of rats were analyzed following oral administration of Que at 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg in the presence or absence of CsA (10 mg/kg) for seven consecutive days. Coadministration of Que (25,50 and 100 mg/kg) decreased the maximum serum concentration of CsA by 46, 50 and 47% in a doseindependent manner. In addition, the area under the curve to the last measurable concentration and area under the curve to infinite time were decreased, by 21 and 16%, 30 and 33%, and 33 and 34% (P<0.01), respectively. However, the mRNA and protein expression levels of the abovementioned DMEs and DTs were inhibited by Que in a dosedependent manner (P<0.01) to a similar extent in the small intestine and liver. It was demonstrated that Que was able to reduce the bioavailability of CsA following multiple concomitant doses in rats. Overlapping modulation of intestinal and hepatic DMEs and DTs, as well as the DMEDT interplay are potential explanations for these observations.
