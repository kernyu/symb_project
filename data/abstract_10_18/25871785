Otitis media (OM) is one of the most common infections in children, Streptococcus pneumoniae and nontypable Haemophilus influenzae being the two most common pathogens isolated in the middle ear fluid (MEF) of children with OM. Cefditoren is a third-generation cephalosporin with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, including activity against those pathogens commonly causing OM, with enhanced stability against common beta-lactamases. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of cefditoren against pathogens collected from the MEF of Costa Rican children with OM between 2006 and 2011. A total of 715 samples were analyzed. Among the 89 S. pneumoniae strains that were penicillin-nonsusceptible, only 7% were cefditoren-resistant according to Spanish Regulatory Agency criteria; among the H. influenza and M. catarrhalis isolates obtained, 100 and 90% of the isolates, respectively, were cefditoren-susceptible. MIC50/90 against the 207 PCV-13 S. pneumoniae serotyped strains and the 79 serotypes not covered by PCV-13 for cefditoren were 0.03/1 and 0.03/0.12 mg/l, respectively. For both amoxicillin-susceptible and resistant H. influenzae strains, the MIC range against cefditoren was from </=0.015 to 0.06 mg/l as well. In conclusion, the confirmation of the wide spectrum of activity of cefditoren and its intrinsic strength against resistant strains allows us to suggest that cefditoren might be included as one of the best choices among antibiotics that are widely used in empiric therapy for OM in pediatric patients.
