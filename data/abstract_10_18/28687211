Infection control in the intensive care unit (ICU) has seen many advances, including rapid molecular screening tests for resistant organisms and chlorhexidine use in daily baths. Although these developments advance the cause of infection prevention, compliance with some of the basic measures remains elusive. Hand hygiene, antimicrobial stewardship, and reduction in device use remain the low-technology interventions that could have a major impact on nosocomial transmission of antimicrobial-resistant organisms. Although continued research is needed on new and old ways of preventing nosocomial infections, ICU staff must persevere in improving adherence with the measures that are known to be effective.
