Malaria is still considered a deadly scourge in Africa, Asia, and South America despite improved vector control and curative treatments with new antimalarial combinations. The next challenge is to work towards disease eradication. To achieve this goal it is crucial to develop, validate, and integrate biological assays into test cascades that align with the key target product profiles. For anti-relapse, a parent molecule should kill hypnozoites or cause activation of Plasmodium vivax liver stages. For transmission blocking, dual equal-activity antimalarials killing both the asexual and the sexual parasite stages in human blood are favored. Finally, by assessing cross resistance and generating drug resistance in the laboratory, it is expected that new medicines with acceptable resistance profiles will be forthcoming.
