Substantial progress has been achieved in antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis B; however, options for women of child-bearing age with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B remain a challenge. In this study, we sought to determine whether de novo combination therapy of Adefovir plus Lamivudine was a super treatment for women of child-bearing age with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B prior to conception. A total of 122 women patients of child-bearing age with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B were randomly assigned to receive (i) 10 mg Adefovir plus 100 mg Lamivudine (64 patients) or (ii) 10 mg Adefovir monotherapy (58 patients), administrated orally once daily for 96 weeks. The therapeutic efficacy within each group was compared at weeks 48 and 96. The results showed that de novo combination therapy of Adefovir plus Lamivudine significantly reduced HBV-DNA detectability, and enhanced ALT normalization and HBeAg seroconversion in women of child-bearing age with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B. No virological breakthrough and genotypic resistance were observed in the combination therapy group. Additionally, the combination therapy with Adefovir plus Lamivudine was well tolerated. This study suggests that de novo combination therapy of Adefovir plus Lamivudine offers a therapeutic advantage for women of child-bearing age with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B when taken before conception.
