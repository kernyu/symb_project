The increasing resistance of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum to currently available drugs necessitates a continuous effort to develop new antimalarial agents. We therefore aimed to assess the in vitro activity of the antifungal drugs clotrimazole, fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, flucytosine, amphotericin B, and caspofungin against field isolates of P. falciparum from Lambarene, Gabon. Using the histidin-rich protein 2 (HRP-2) assay we determined the drug susceptibility (EC(50), EC(90)) of 16 field isolates obtained from outpatients attending the Albert Schweitzer Hospital in Lambarene, Gabon. For fluconazole, itraconazole and caspofungin the in vitro growth inhibition of these drugs is reported for the first time. Our data indicate that clotrimazole, fluconazole, itraconazole and caspofungin show median EC(50) values of 3.1 microg/mL, 1.9 microg/mL, 1.1 microg/mL and 1.1 microg/mL respectively. Ketoconazole, voriconazole, flucytosine and amphotercin B showed no relevant growth inhibition within the range of drug concentrations used in this study.
