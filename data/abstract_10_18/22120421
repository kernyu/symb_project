The purpose of this investigation was to analyse Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus, GBS) isolates collected in Italy from vaginal and urine samples in respect to their clonality, distribution of virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance determinants. Three hundred and eighty-eight GBS were recovered from clinical samples. They were analysed for antibiotic resistance profiling. Erythromycin-resistant strains were further characterised by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), serotyping and the detection of alp genes of the alpha-like protein (Alp) family. GBS isolates represented 40 different sequence types (STs), grouped in five clonal complexes (CCs) and belonged to seven serotypes. Most serotype V strains (81%) possessed alp2-3; serotype Ia carried mainly epsilon, while the serotype III mainly rib. All isolates were susceptible to penicillin, whereas resistance to erythromycin was detected in 15% of isolates. Most erythromycin-resistant GBS strains were of serotype V (56.8%) and belonged to the CC-1 group (50%). Macrolide resistance phenotypes were the cMLS(B) (46.5%) and the M phenotypes (46.5%) due to the presence of ermB and mefA/E genes, respectively. These results provide data which establish a baseline for monitoring erythromycin resistance in this region and also provide an insight into the correlation among clonal types, serotypes, surface protein and resistance genes. The increased prevalence of strains that displayed the M phenotype strengthens the importance of the epidemiological surveillance of macrolide resistance in GBS, which may also represent an important reservoir of resistance genes for other species.
