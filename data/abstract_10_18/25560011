PURPOSE: Different approaches have been used for preventing biofilm-related infections in health care settings. Many of these methods have their own de-merits, which include chemical-based complications; emergent antibiotic resistant strains, etc. The formation of biofilm is the hallmark characteristic of Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis infection, which consists of multiple layers of bacteria encased within an exopolysachharide glycocalyx. Nanotechnology may provide the answer to penetrate such biofilms and reduce biofilm formation. Therefore, the aim of present study was to demonstrate the biofilm formation by methicillin resistance S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin resistance S. epidermidis (MRSE) isolated from wounds by direct visualisation applying tissue culture plate, tube and Congo Red Agar methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The anti-biofilm activity of AgNPs was investigated by Congo Red, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) techniques. RESULTS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was found to be in the range of 11.25-45 mug/ml. The AgNPs coated surfaces effectively restricted biofilm formation of the tested bacteria. Double fluorescent staining (propidium iodide staining to detect bacterial cells and fluorescein isothiocyanate concanavalin A (Con A-FITC) staining to detect the exopolysachharides matrix) technique using CLSM provides the visual evidence that AgNPs arrested the bacterial growth and prevent the glycocalyx formation. In our study, we could demonstrate the complete anti-biofilm activity AgNPs at a concentration as low as 50 mug/ml. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that AgNPs can be exploited towards the development of potential anti-bacterial coatings for various biomedical and environmental applications. In the near future, the AgNPs may play major role in the coating of medical devices and treatment of infections caused due to highly antibiotic resistant biofilm.
