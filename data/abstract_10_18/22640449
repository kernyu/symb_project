Based on data from 14 Supranational Tuberculosis (TB) Reference Laboratories worldwide, the proportion of rifampicin (RMP) resistant isolates that were isoniazid (INH) susceptible by phenotypic drug susceptibility testing varied widely (0.5-11.6%). RMP-resistant isolates that were INH-susceptible had significantly lower rates of resistance to other first- and second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs (except rifabutin) compared to multidrug-resistant isolates. RMP resistance is not always a good proxy for a presumptive diagnosis of multidrug-resistant TB, which has implications for use of molecular assays that identify only RMP resistance-associated DNA mutations.
