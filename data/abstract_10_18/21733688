In the present investigation, a series of 3-substituted-N-aryl-6,7-dimethoxy-3a,4-dihydro-3H-indeno[1,2-c]pyrazole-2-carbox amide analogues were synthesized and were evaluated for antitubercular activity by two fold serial dilution technique. All the newly synthesized compounds showed moderate to high inhibitory activities against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H(37)Rv and INH resistant M. tuberculosis. The compound N,3-bis(4-fluorophenyl)-6,7-dimethoxy-3a,4-dihydro-3H-indeno[1,2-c]pyrazole-2-car boxamide (4c) was found to be the most promising compound active against M. tuberculosis H(37)Rv and isoniazid resistant M. tuberculosis with minimum inhibitory concentration 0.78 muM.
