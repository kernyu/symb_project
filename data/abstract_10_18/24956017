INTRODUCTION: Healthcare-associated infections caused by multi-drug resistant bacteria remain a major cause of worldwide mortality. With the recent approval of agents such as hetero-resistant cocci (i.e., ceftaroline, ceftobiprole, telavancin) for the treatment of Gram-positive infections by and drugs like fidaxomicin for treating Clostridium difficile, present-day research on antibacterials has largely shifted to developing interventions for diseases caused by Gram-negative bacilli. Cephalosporins have gained significant interest as antipseudomonals to be used in hospitals for treating device- and procedure-associated infections. With extended-spectrum activity against many enterobacterial pathogens, the introduction of new antipseudomonal cephalosporin-based treatments will mark a significant advancement in the management of hospital-borne diseases. AREAS COVERED: The following review examines the present-day status of investigational cephalosporins currently in preclinical, Phase I and Phase II stage development. The article focuses specifically on treatments used for healthcare-associated infections due to Gram-negative bacteria. EXPERT OPINION: There is an urgent need for new antimicrobials to treat nosocomial infections due to multi-drug resistant Gram-negative bacteria. The impending approvals of antipseudomonal cephalosporins co-formulated with a beta-lactamase inhibitor will allow clinicians to treat more hetero-resistant infections with cephalosporins, while avoiding the use of more toxic agents such as colistin. The growing interest in developing new beta-lactamase inhibitor combinatorial treatments with approved beta-lactam antibiotics is anticipated to decrease the number of novel cephalosporins entering clinical trials this decade.
