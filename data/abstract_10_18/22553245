In this study, a total of 77 multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant (MDR and XDR, respectively) isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were characterized among samples from patients living in Jiangxi province, China. The following two approaches were used: (i) genotyping all drug-resistant isolates by the 15-locus MIRU-VNTR (mycobacterial interspersed repetitive-unit-variable-number tandem-repeat) method and identifying the Beijing family genotype using the RD105 deletion targeted multiplex PCR and (ii) determining the mutation profiles associated with the resistance to the first-line antituberculous drugs rifampin (RIF) and isoniazid (INH) and the second-line drugs ofloxacin (OFX), kanamycin (KAN), amikacin (AMK), and capreomycin (CAP) with DNA sequencing. Six loci were examined: rpoB (for resistance to RIF), katG and mabA-inhA (INH), gyrA and gyrB (OFX), and rrs (KAN, AMK, and CAP). It is shown that the Beijing genotype was predominant (80.5%) among these strains and that the selected drug-resistant strains were genetically diverse, suggesting that they probably had independently acquired drug resistance. In comparison to the phenotypic data, the sensitivities for the detection of RIF, INH, OFX, and KAN/AMK/CAP resistance by DNA sequencing were 94.8, 80.5, 84.6, and 78.9%, respectively. The most prevalent mutations involved in RIF, INH, OFX, and KAN/AMK/CAP resistance were Ser531Leu in rpoB (44.2%), Ser315Thr in katG (55.8%) and C-15T in mabA-inhA (11.7%), Asp94Gly in gyrA (48.7%), and A1401G in rrs (73.7%), respectively. Five novel katG mutants (Trp191Stop, Thr271Pro, Trp328Phe, Leu546Pro, and Asp695Gly) and six new alleles (Ile569Val, Ile572Met, Phe584Ser, Val615Met, Asp626Glu, and Lys972Thr) in the rpoB gene were identified.
