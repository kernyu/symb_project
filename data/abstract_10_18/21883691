BACKGROUND: Neonates are at high risk for nosocomial infections due to multidrug-resistant pathogens. The use of beta-lactamase inhibitors in combination with beta-lactam antibiotics broadens the antimicrobial spectrum. Cefoperazone/sulbactam is used in children but there are limited data on its usage in neonates. The purpose of the present study was therefore to evaluate the use of cefoperazone/sulbactam in the treatment of neonatal infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens. METHODS: The records of neonates who were hospitalized and who received cefoperazone/sulbactam were reviewed. RESULTS: There were 90 infants who received cefoperazone/sulbactam. A pathogen could be isolated in 41 (45.6%) of the infants. In total, 17.1% of isolated pathogens were resistant to cefoperazone/sulbactam. Side-effects were seen in four of the infants. Two infants had cholestasis, one infant had neutropenia and one had superinfection with candida. CONCLUSION: Cefoperazone/sulbactam can be used in the treatment of nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens in neonates.
