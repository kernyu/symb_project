We describe the activity of a novel cephalosporin, CXA-101 (FR26 4205), against a panel of highly resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates collected from U.S. hospitals. CXA-101 demonstrated increased potency against this population of resistant isolates, with activity that is 4- to 10-fold higher than that of comparator agents in each phenotypic category. The addition of tazobactam did not improve its activity. CXA-101 appears to be a promising addition to the category of antipseudomonal beta-lactams.
