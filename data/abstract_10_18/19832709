Thirty-six multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates collected in Japan were examined for pyrazinamide susceptibility and pyrazinamidase activity, and analysed by pncA sequencing and a hybridization-based line probe assay (LiPA), which was used to detect pncA mutations for the rapid identification of pyrazinamide-resistant isolates. Pyrazinamide resistance was found in 19 (53%) of them. All pyrazinamide-resistant isolates had no pyrazinamidase activity and at least one mutation in pncA. Among the pncA mutations, 11 had not been previously reported. The results of the LiPA were fully consistent with the DNA sequencing results. A majority of MDR M. tuberculosis isolates in Japan were resistant to pyrazinamide.
