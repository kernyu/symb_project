We report a case of CTX-M-55-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Shigella sonnei infection in a 27-year-old Korean woman who had traveled to China. The patient was admitted to the hospital due to abdominal pain, watery diarrhea, and fever (39.3). S. sonnei was isolated from her stool specimens, and the pathogen was found to be resistant to cefotaxime due to CTX-M-55-type ESBL. Insertion sequence (IS)Ecp1 was found upstream of the blaCTX-M-55 gene. The blaCTX-M-55 gene was transferred from the S. sonnei isolate to an Escherichia coli J53 recipient by conjugation. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and Southern blotting revealed that the blaCTX-M-55 gene was located on a plasmid of approximately 130 kb.
