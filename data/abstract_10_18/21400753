The best therapeutic effect in the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B was observed with the use of cycloferon in the scheme of the antiviral therapy. The combination of cycloferon with lamivudine provided complete stable remission in 54.1% of the patients, whereas the use of a-interferon in combination with cycloferon provided remission in 44.1% of the lamivudine-resistant patients. The use of cycloferon in the therapy of chronic hepatitis B made it possible to lower the frequency and manifestation level of the side effects and prevented the lamivudine resistance development and generation of the virus mutants.
