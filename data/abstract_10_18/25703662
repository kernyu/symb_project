Diagnosis and management of infectious endocarditis are particularly challenging in patients with severe burns. Cases requiring operative intervention are likely to have higher complication rates as a result of poor wound healing, recurrent bacteremia secondary to burn wound manipulation, and sequelae of anticoagulation in patients who require repeated reconstructive and cosmetic procedures. Few case reports exist describing mitral valve replacement for infectious endocarditis in burn patients. In this article, we review the literature to describe and address these challenges, and present what we believe to be the first case of mitral valve repair for infectious endocarditis in a thermally injured patient.
