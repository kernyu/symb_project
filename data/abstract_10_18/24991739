Yersinia ruckeri is the causative agent of yersiniosis, a disease reported in a number of fish species, especially rainbow trout. This study was undertaken to describe the phenotypes of Y. ruckeri on French rainbow trout farms. More than 100 isolates, collected during recent outbreaks on trout farms, were characterized by phenotypic tests, namely using biochemical tests of the API 20E system, serotyping, biotyping (tests for motility and lipase activity) and by describing the pattern of susceptibility to several antibiotics. The isolates showed a low phenotypic diversity with a prevalent serotype (O1) and API 20E profile 5 1(3)07 100. As in other European countries, Biotype 2 (BT2), which lacks both motility and secreted lipase activity, was found to be present in France. The emergence of 'French' BT2 was different than that observed for other European countries (Finland, Spain, Denmark and the UK). The antibiotic pattern was uniform for all isolates, regardless of the geographical area studied. The results indicate that no resistance has yet emerged, and the efficacy of the antibiotic generally used against yersiniosis in France, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxasol, is not compromised (minimum inhibitory concentrations [MIC] of between 0.016 and 0.128 microg ml-1). Enrofloxacin and doxycycline, not used as a first-line treatment in fish diseases, have reasonably good efficacies (with MICs </=0.128 and 0.256, respectively).
