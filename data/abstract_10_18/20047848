OBJECTIVES: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a prominent nosocomial bacterial pathogen, associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The global incidence is increasing, and Latin America is no exception. This article reviews MRSA clonal distribution in Latin America and implications for clinical practice. DESIGN: A PubMed literature search (1966-2008) identified 32 articles that characterized MRSA clones in Latin America. RESULTS: Data from these articles show that since 1990, several epidemic MRSA clones have spread in Latin America. The multidrug-resistant Brazilian clone is widespread, especially in Brazil and Argentina, but more recently clones with susceptibility to a range of antibiotics have been detected in Brazil, whereas in Argentina, as in Chile, Colombia and Paraguay, the multidrug-resistant Cordobes/Chilean clone prevails. In Mexico, the New York/Japan clone is most frequent. Data were not available from every country and, despite the increasing prevalence of community MRSA infections, most were collected from tertiary care centers. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of epidemic MRSA clones are circulating in Latin America, some of which harbor genes that encode multidrug resistance or enhanced pathogenicity. Continued collection and reporting of epidemiological data is crucial for effective prevention and treatment.
