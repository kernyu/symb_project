We have studied the structural properties of human erythrocytes under the action of antibacterial substances of different nature (macrolides, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, lincosamides). It has been established that antibiotics modify the cytoplasmic skeleton of erythrocytes and induce their hemolytic efficiency. The character of changes in the osmotic resistance of erythrocytes depends on the chemical structure of modifiers.
