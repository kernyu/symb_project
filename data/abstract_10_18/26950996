AIM: Study biological properties of salmonella, isolated from clinical materials and water of Don river. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Salmonella strains of various serovars were used in the study. Biochemical characteristics were studied by generally accepted methods, antigenic properties were evaluated in agglutination reactions, virulence was determined by Dlm for laboratory animals, antibiotics sensitivity was verified by disc-diffusion method. RESULTS: The presence of pathogenicity factors in isolated strains was shown: hemolytic activity--in 64 and 36.8% of cases, DNAse activity--in 28 and 26%, respectively in clinical and wild strains. Microorganism dose, resulting in death of all the animals (LD100) did not depend on serovar of salmonella and varied from 10(3) to 10(10) PFU/ml. CONCLUSION: Clinical strains were established to possess higher virulence and resistance to antibiotics compared with strains isolated from the aquatic envionment.
