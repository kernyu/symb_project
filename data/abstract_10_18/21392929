BACKGROUND: Over-use of antibiotics for acute respiratory infections (ARIs) increases antimicrobial resistance, treatment costs, and side effects. Patient desire for antibiotics contributes to over-use. OBJECTIVE: To explore whether a point-of-care interactive computerized education module increases patient knowledge and decreases desire for antibiotics. METHODS: Bilingual (English/Spanish) interactive kiosks were available in 8 emergency departments as part of a multidimensional intervention to reduce antibiotic prescribing for ARIs. The symptom-tailored module included assessment of symptoms, knowledge about ARIs (3 items), and desire for antibiotics on a 10-point visual analog scale. Multivariable analysis assessed predictors of change in desire for antibiotics. RESULTS: Of 686 adults with ARI symptoms, 63% initially thought antibiotics might help. The proportion of patients with low (1-3 on the scale) desire for antibiotics increased from 22% pre-module to 49% post-module (p<.001). Self-report of "learning something new" was associated with decreased desire for antibiotics, after adjusting for baseline characteristics (p=.001). CONCLUSION: An interactive educational kiosk improved knowledge about antibiotics and ARIs. Learning correlated with changes in personal desire for antibiotics. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: By reducing desire for antibiotics, point-of-care interactive educational computer technology may help decrease inappropriate use for antibiotics for ARIs.
