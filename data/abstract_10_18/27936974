INTRODUCTION: Without treatment, many of the 200 million people worldwide with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection will develop cirrhosis or liver cancer. Japan was the first nation to approve an interferon-free therapy for HCV, and sustained viral response (SVR) rates >90% have been achieved with asunaprevir, a protease inhibitor, plus daclatasvir, an inhibitor of the non-structural 5A (NS5A) protein. Areas covered: This review provides an overview of the results from both clinical trials and real world experience with asunaprevir and daclatasvir therapy focused primarily on Japan. A literature search using the keywords 'asunaprevir,' 'daclatasvir,' 'interferon-free therapy,' and 'direct-acting antiviral drugs' was initially used to select relevant literature for inclusion in the review. Expert commentary: While not approved in the United States, dual therapy with asunaprevir plus daclatasvir has already been successfully used in Japan and throughout East Asia to treat many thousands of patients. Pre-existing or treatment-emergent NS5A-Y93 or -L31 resistance-associated variants (RAVs) may lead to viral breakthrough, and alternative therapies should be considered for these patients, but patients who harbor NS5A RAVs only at low frequency are likely to achieve SVR. The therapy has also been shown to be safe and effective with renal dysfunction or liver cirrhosis.
