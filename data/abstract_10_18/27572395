A collection of 74 Enterobacteriaceae isolates found in Bo, Sierra Leone, were tested for quinolone antibiotic susceptibility and resistance mechanisms. The majority of isolates (62%) were resistant to quinolones, and 61% harbored chromosomal gyrA and/or parC mutations. Plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes were ubiquitous, with qnrB and aac(6')-Ib-cr being the most prevalent. Mutated LexA binding sites were found in all qnrB1 genes, and truncated qnrB pseudogenes were found in the majority of Citrobacter isolates.
