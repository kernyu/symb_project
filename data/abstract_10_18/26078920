AIM: To characterize AmpC-beta lactamases among Enterobacteriaceae isolates from clinical samples at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital. STUDY DESIGN: Laboratory-based descriptive cross-sectional study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Microbiology Department, Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital and MBN clinical Laboratories, between May to September 2013. METHODOLOGY: This study included 293 Enterobacteriaceae isolates recovered from clinical specimens that included blood, urine, stool and aspirates. AmpC Beta lactamase production was determined using disc placement method for cefoxitin at a break point of <18mm. Common AmpC plasmid mediated genes were EBC, ACC, FOX, DHA, CIT and MOX were; was determined by Multiplex PCR as described by Hanson and Perez-Perez. RESULTS: Plasmid mediated AmpC phenotype was confirmed in 107 of the 293 (36.5%) cefoxitin resistant isolates with 30 isolates having more than one gene coding for resistance. The commonest source that harbored AmpC beta lactamases was urine and E. coli was the most common AmpC producer (59.5%). The genotypes detected in this study, included EBC (n=36), FOX (n=18), ACC (n=11), CIT (n=10), DHA (n=07) and MOX (n=1). CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that prevalence of AmpC beta-lactamase at MRRH was high (39.6), with EBC as the commonest genotype among Enterobacteriaceae Urine and E. coli were the commonest source and organism respectively that harbored AmpC beta-lactamases. There's rational antimicrobial therapy and antibiotic susceptibility tests should be requested by health workers especially patients presenting with urinary tract infections and bacteraemias.
