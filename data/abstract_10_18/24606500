The present review is intended to bring together the main advances in the field of nanostructured biomaterials with antimicrobial properties. It is generally accepted that the discovery of antibiotics was of great importance but, nowadays new antimicrobial agents are needed and/or their better administration routes. The limitation of the use of antibiotics is essential because of the following reasons: the excessive use of antibiotics leads to the development of antibiotic resistant microorganisms; there are some alternatives for many types of infections, many of these alternatives being less toxic and do not lead to antibiotic similar resistance. In compliance with the above presented, the use of antibiotic is recommended to be eliminated (when alternatives are available) or to be reduced by using combined therapy when possible or to administrate these drugs through targeted or loco-regional drug delivery systems.
