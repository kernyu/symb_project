The increasing prevalence of invasive infections caused by antibiotic resistant Escherichia coli strains in Romanian patients, already mentioned in the European reports, requires better knowledge of their specific traits. Thus, a set of 38 E. coli blood isolates, collected between 2010 and 2012 at one of the local hospitals participating into the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network, was investigated retrospectively with respect to the phylogenetic origin, extraintestinal virulence-associated markers (i.e. fimH, papC, papG alleles, sfa/foc, afa/dra, hly, cnf1, sat, iucC, fyuA, ibeA), and beta-lactamase encoding genes (i.e. bla CTX-M, bla TEM, and bla SHV alleles). The isolates with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) phenotypes were further characterized using PCR-based replicon typing and multilocus sequencing typing. For ST131 members, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and PCR-based detection of fimH30 allele were performed. Overall, the isolates were more likely members of the major phylogenetic group A (53 %) and to a lesser extent of groups B2 (29 %), D (10 %), and B1 (8 %). All but three of the virulence markers sought (i.e. papGI, hly, cnf1) were detected with prevalence ranging from 3 % (i.e. ibeA, papGIII) to 87 % (fimH). As expected, the most complex genotypes (four to seven virulence markers) defined the isolates derived from phylogenetic groups B2 and D. ESBL producers were bla CTX-M-15-positive, mostly of phylogroup A (67 %), harboured IncF multireplicon plasmids, and belonged to six sequence types (i.e. ST10, ST131, ST167, ST410, ST540, ST1275). Members of ST10 clonal complex (i.e. ST10, ST167) were the most common. The ST131 isolates belonged to H30 subclone and displayed 74 % similarity at PFGE analysis.
