Severe infections caused by Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and other bacteria are responsible for millions of deaths each year. One of the main objectives of future antibiotic strategies is to develop new anti-infective agents, which would be highly effective and drug-resistant (antimicrobial resistance being currently exhibited by MRSA), using specific antibodies conjugated to thermally active nanomaterials such as NIR-responsive photothermal contrast agents. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) covalently functionalized with immunoglobulin G (IgG, an antagonist of Staphylococcal protein A-SpA, which is a MRSA membrane associated protein) were selectively delivered (at various concentrations and incubation times) into MRSA bacteria. Following treatment, cultures were irradiated using an 808 nm 2 w laser diode. The post irradiation death rate ranged from 39.6% (for 1 mg/L) to 79.2% (for 50 mg/L) at 60 seconds (p < 0.001), while at 30 minutes, the death rate increased from 45.2% (1 mg/L) to 85.72% (50 mg/L), p < 0.001. Irradiated MRSAs treated with MWCNTs alone (control) for 60 seconds and 30 minutes, at concentrations ranging from 1 mg/L to 50 mg/L, resulted in significantly lower death rates (7.1-34.1% for 60 seconds, 11.7-48.8% for 30 minutes). Using IgG molecules bound to MWCNTs, followed by laser irradiation, we obtained a very efficacious nanoshell-mediated laser therapy of individual MRSA agents providing highly localized killing effects for IgG-MWCNTs targeted bacteria.
