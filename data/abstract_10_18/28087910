Artemisinin is an anti-malarial drug with poor water solubility and oral absorption; so a variety of derivatives based on the parent nucleus have been developed. Compared with artemisinin, dihydroartemisinin (DHA) has a stronger anti-malaria activity, and has the advantages of high metabolic rate and better water solubility. Recent studies have discovered that DHA has a good inhibitory effect on tumor cells, which is closely related to the peroxide bridge in its molecular structure. Since tumor cells need more Fe(3+) than normal cells, there are a large number of transferrin receptors on the tumor cell membrane. DHA can break the peroxide bridge in the presence of Fe(2+), and the free radicals generated can play its lethal effect on tumor cells. In addition, DHA can promote endocytosis of transferrin receptor, and thus prevent cancer cells from taking Fe(3+) from microenvironment. This article reviews the anti-tumor molecular mechanism of DHA, including accelerating oxidative damage, inducing apoptosis, inhibiting the growth, proliferation and invasion of tumor cells, reversing tumor multidrug resistance.
