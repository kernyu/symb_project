Multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDRB) have emerged as a public health problem and the World Health Organization recommends actions to control MDRB in healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs). This study describes a surveillance programme for MDRB in HCAIs at Curitiba, Brazil. MDRB in pneumonia, bloodstream, urinary tract and surgical site infections has been surveyed since January 2010. Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and third generation resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most frequent MDRB in HCAIs. Infection control strategies enrolling hospitals and public health have been developed. The data presented describe MDRB prevalence and the feasibility of this municipal MDRB surveillance programme in Brazil.
