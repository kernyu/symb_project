OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of antibiotic stewardship on the pathogen and clinical outcome of neonatal bloodstream infections (BSIs). METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on neonates with BSIs who were admitted to the neonatal ward in the years of 2010 (pre-stewardship) and 2013 (post-stewardship) for pathogens, antibiotic resistance, antibiotic use, and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: The admission rate of BSIs (6.47% vs 2.78%) and the incidence of nosocomial BSIs (0.70% vs 0.30%) in 2013 were significantly higher than in 2010 (P<0.01). However, there were no signicant differences in the clinical outcomes between the years of 2010 and 2013 (P>0.05). The four most common pathogens isolated from blood cultures, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae ssp pneumoniae and E.coli, were similar between the two years. There were no significant differences in the detection rates of extended spectrum beta-lactamase-positve Klebsiella pneumoniae ssp pneumoniae or E.coli between the two years. The detection rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus/beta-lactamase-positive Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were similar between the two years (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Since the implementation of antibiotic stewardship, there has been no marked variation in the common pathogens and their antibacterial resistance in neonatal BSIs. The antibiotic stewardship could promote the recovery of patients with BSIs.
