The presence of Enterobacteriaceae producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) or transferable AmpC beta-lactamases (pAmpC) is increasingly being reported in humans and animals world-wide. Their occurrence in food-producing animals suggests that meat is a possible link between the two populations. This study investigated the occurrence and characteristics of Salmonella and ESBL- or pAmpC-producing E. coli in 430 samples of beef, pork and broiler meat imported into Sweden, in order to provide data required for assessing the potential public health risk of these bacteria in food. Depending on region of origin, ESBL/pAmpC-producing E. coli were found in 0-8% of beef samples, 2-13% of pork samples and 15-95% of broiler meat samples. The highest prevalence was in South American broiler meat (95%), followed by broiler meat from Europe (excluding Denmark) (61%) and from Denmark (15%). Isolates from meat outside Scandinavia were generally defined as multiresistant. A majority of the ESBL/pAmpC genes were transferable by conjugation. Bla(CTX-M-2) and bla(CTX-M-8) were the dominant genes in E. coli from South American broiler meat, whereas bla(CMY-2) and bla(CTX-M-1) dominated in European meat. The majority of bla(CMY-2) and bla(CTX-M-1) were situated on plasmids of replicon type incK and incI1, respectively. The same combinations of ESBL/pAmpC genes and plasmids have been described previously in clinical human isolates. Salmonella was found in five samples tested, from European pork and broiler meat. No Salmonella isolate was resistant to third-generation cephalosporins. In conclusion, meat imported into Sweden, broiler meat in particular, is a potential source of human exposure to ESBL- and pAmpC-producing E. coli.
