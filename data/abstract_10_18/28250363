Aspergillus species are ubiquitous in the environment and Aspergillus fumigatus can cause life-threatening infections in immunocompromised patients. beta-1,3-/1,6-glucan is a major fungal cell wall polysaccharide that has various biological effects on the infected host, but little is known about the influence of beta-glucan on the fungus itself. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the cell wall beta-glucan content could be increased in Aspergillus spp. by addition of beta-glucan to the culture medium. In this study, we investigated the influence of beta-glucan on the susceptibility of A. fumigatus to antifungal agents. A. fumigatus was cultured in the presence or absence of beta-glucan for antifungal susceptibility testing based on changes of the growth rate and morphology. Susceptibility to micafungin, a beta-glucan synthase inhibitor, was about 10-fold lower when beta-glucan was added to the culture medium. On the other hand, susceptibility to amphotericin B and voriconazole was similar in either the presence or absence of beta-glucan. These results strongly suggest that beta-glucan has an important physiological role in Aspergillus spp.
