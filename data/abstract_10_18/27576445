Novel antifungals are in high demand due to the challenges associated with resistant, persistent, and systemic fungal infections. Synthetic mimics of antimicrobial peptides are emerging as a promising class of compounds for antifungal treatment. In the current study, five synthetic cationic antimicrobial tripeptides were evaluated as antifungal therapeutics against 24 pathogenic strains of fungi. Three of the peptides displayed strong general antifungal properties at low micromolar inhibitory concentrations. The most promising peptide, compound 5, was selected and evaluated as an antifungal remedy for Candida albicans candidiasis in a human skin model and for the treatment of Trichophyton rubrum induced onychomycosis in an infected human nail model. Compound 5 was shown to display antifungal properties and a rapid mode of action superior to those of both the commercial comparators Loceryl and Lamisil. Compound 5 was also active against a clinical isolate of Candida albicans with acquired fluconazole resistance.
