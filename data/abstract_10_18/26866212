Bacteriophages typically may be grouped into two categories by their life cycle: lytic phages and lysogenic (temperate) phages. The five decades following the discovery of phages saw numerous investigations on the lytic phages of S. pyogenes, which included studies on host range, basic biology, and their ability to mediate general transduction. In contrast to lysogenic phages, lytic phages do not alter the phenotype of the host streptococcal cell during a long-term genetic relationship, but can shape the host population by eliminating susceptible cells in a population, or by facilitating genetic exchange by transduction. This chapter also presents a summary of information on the lysogenic phages of group A streptococci, their distribution and attachment sites, morphology and genome organization, and associated virulence genes. Additional areas of overview include the diversity of lysogenic phages and the horizontal transfer of genes from other species. Finally, there is a discussion of prophages as vectors for virulence genes, phage-like elements that carry antimicrobial resistance genes, and regulation of host gene expression.
