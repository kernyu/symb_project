OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution and antibiotic resistance of pathogens isolated from children with complicated urinary tract infection. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on the distribution and antibiotic resistance of pathogens isolated from 181 children with complicated urinary tract infection (positive urine culture). The antibiotic resistance of common pathogens was determined by the antimicrobial susceptibility test. RESULTS: Gram-negative bacilli were the main pathogens (63.5%), and involved Escherichia coli (E.coli) of 42.0%. Gram-positive cocci accounted for 32.1%, and involved enterococci faecalis of 15.5%. Fungi infection was found in 4.4% of children. The resistance rate of E.coli to ampicillin was the highest (89.4%), but the rate decreased significantly by adding amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (34.2%). E.coli had a high resistance rate to cephazolin, ceftriaxone and cafalotin (>50%), but the resistance rate of E.coli to cefoperazone/sulbouam was significantly lower than other cephalosporins (P<0.01). E.coli was sensitive to imipenem and displayed a lower resistance rate to furadantin (<10%). The resistance rate of enterococci faecalis to rifampicin was high (78.3%), but was low to furadantin, vancomycin and linezolid (<10%). The multiresistant strains accounted for 77.4% of gram-negative bacilli. CONCLUSIONS: E.coli is the major pathogen in children with complicated urinary tract infection, and the enterococci-caused urinary tract infection has been increasing. These pathogens have a high antibiotic resistance, and most of them are multiresistant. Antimicrobial therapy should be based on the results of urine culture and antimicrobial susceptibility test.
