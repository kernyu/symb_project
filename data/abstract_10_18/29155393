In recent years, the problems associated with bacterial resistance to antibiotics caused nanodrugs to be considered as a new way for infectious diseases treatment. The main purpose of this study was to develop a new agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a very difficult bacterium to treat, based on azlocillin antibiotic and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). Azlocillin was conjugated with AgNPs by chemical methods and its antimicrobial activity was studied against P. aeruginosa using well diffusion agar method. Then, minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration of the new conjugate was specified with macro-dilution method. The animal study showed the considerable enhanced antibacterial effect of azlocillin in conjugation with AgNPs against P. aeruginosa in comparison with azlocillin alone, AgNPs alone and azlocillin in combination with AgNPs.
