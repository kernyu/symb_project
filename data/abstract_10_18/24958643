MRSA-chrom, a novel chromogenic screening agar medium for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), was developed. There were all MRSA strains recovered in 24h as a specific blue-colored colony among 130 microbes including 42 MRSA strains. MRSA-chrom showed the highest detection ratio among 4 commercially available selective media using 50 clinical specimens.
