A rise in tigecycline resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae has been reported recently worldwide. We sought to identify risk factors, outcomes, and mechanisms for adult patients with tigecycline-nonsusceptible K. pneumoniae bacteremia in Taiwan. We conducted a matched case-control study (ratio of 1:1) in a medical center in Taiwan from January 2011 through June 2015. The cases were patients with tigecycline-nonsusceptible K. pneumoniae bacteremia, and the controls were patients with tigecycline-susceptible K. pneumoniae bacteremia. Logistic regression was performed to evaluate the potential risk factors for tigecycline-nonsusceptible K. pneumoniae bacteremia. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was performed to analyze acrA, oqxA, ramA, rarA, and kpgA expression among these isolates. A total of 43 cases were matched with 43 controls. The 14-day mortality of patients with tigecycline-nonsusceptible K. pneumoniae bacteremia was 30.2%, and the 28-day mortality was 41.9%. The attributable mortalities of tigecycline-nonsusceptible K. pneumoniae at 14 and 28 days were 9.3 and 18.6%, respectively. Fluoroquinolone use within 30 days prior to bacteremia was the only independent risk factor for tigecycline-nonsusceptible K. pneumoniae bacteremia. The tigecycline-nonsusceptible K. pneumoniae bacteremia was mostly caused by overexpression of AcrAB and/or OqxAB efflux pumps, together with the upregulation of RamA and/or RarA, respectively. One isolate demonstrated isolated overexpression of kpgA In conclusion, tigecycline-nonsusceptible K. pneumoniae bacteremia was associated with high mortality, and prior fluoroquinolone use was the independent risk factor for the acquisition of tigecycline-nonsusceptible K. pneumoniae The overexpression of AcrAB and/or OqxAB contributes to tigecycline nonsusceptibility in K. pneumoniae.
