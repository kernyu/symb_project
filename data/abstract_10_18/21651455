INTRODUCTION: Bacterial enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (ENR) specificity reduces the double bond in enoyl thioester substrates in the final enzymatic step of the elongation cycle of the fatty acid synthase-II pathway. Its function is essential for bacterial organism survival, making it an attractive target for the development of novel antibiotics. The structural features and therapeutic potential of this enzyme have stimulated the rational design of ENR inhibitors, and important progress has been achieved to date. AREAS COVERED: This review describes recent advances made in the search for ENR inhibitors, as reflected by patent applications filed from 2006 to 2010, together with an overview of the relevant literature. The first section of this paper provides a background of the biology of ENR, followed by a description of its structure and function. The main section describes the substrate specificities for ENR, and the structure-based rational design of patent inhibitors originating from different companies and academic groups. EXPERT OPINION: The increase in the number of ENR inhibitors bodes well for the development of new therapeutics against multidrug-resistant bacteria. The challenge is now to improve the pharmacokinetic parameters of these inhibitors and translate them into clinical studies.
