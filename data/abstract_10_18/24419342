To investigate the molecular characterization of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) isolates from China and the association of specific mutations conferring drug resistance with strains of different genotypes, we performed spoligotyping and sequenced nine loci (katG, inhA, the oxyR-ahpC intergenic region, rpoB, tlyA, eis, rrs, gyrA, and gyrB) for 128 MDR-TB isolates. Our results showed that 108 isolates (84.4%) were Beijing family strains, 64 (59.3%) of which were identified as modern Beijing strains. Compared with the phenotypic data, the sensitivity and specificity of DNA sequencing were 89.1% and 100.0%, respectively, for isoniazid (INH) resistance, 93.8% and 100.0% for rifampin (RIF) resistance, 60.0% and 99.4% for capreomycin (CAP) resistance, 84.6% and 99.4% for kanamycin (KAN) resistance, and 90.0% and 100.0% for ofloxacin (OFX) resistance. The most prevalent mutations among the MDR-TB isolates were katG315, inhA15, rpoB531, -526, and -516, rrs1401, eis-10, and gyrA94, -90, and -91. Furthermore, there was no association between specific resistance-conferring mutations and the strain genotype. These findings will be helpful for the establishment of rapid molecular diagnostic methods to be implemented in China.
