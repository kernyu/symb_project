Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have a great potential to be used as a substitute for antibiotics since AMPs don't lead to bacteria's drug resistance. Anti-lipopolysaccharide factors (ALFs) are one type of AMPs and exist in crustaceans. In the present study, we produced a recombinant protein (rFcALF5) of an ALF isoform (FcALF5) from Chinese shrimp Fenneropenaeus chinensis through a prokaryotic expression system. The rFcALF5 exhibited varied antibacterial activities against different bacteria. Besides its antibacterial activities, it could also inhibit the infection of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) to shrimp after pre-incubation with this virus. In order to learn the antiviral mechanism on how rFcALF5 influences WSSV infection, the interaction between the total proteins of WSSV and rFcALF5 was analyzed and the data showed that rFcALF5 had direct interaction with the envelope protein VP24 of WSSV. The LPS binding domain (LBD) of FcALF5 also showed direct interaction with VP24 of WSSV. Therefore we inferred that the antiviral activity of FcALF5 might be achieved through the binding of its LBD to VP24 of WSSV. These findings provided more information to develop new strategies for the control of shrimp disease in aquaculture.
