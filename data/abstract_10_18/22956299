Stingray phospholipase A(2) group IIA (SPLA(2)-IIA) was recently isolated and purified to homogeneity from the intestine of the common stingray Dasyatis pastinaca, suggesting that this enzyme plays an important role in systemic bactericidal defense. The present study showed that SPLA(2)-IIA was highly bactericidal against Gram-positive bacteria with inhibition zones and minimal inhibitory concentration values in the range of 13-25 mm and 2-8 mug/ml, respectively, whereas Gram-negative bacteria exhibited a much higher resistance. The bactericidal efficiency of SPLA(2)-IIA was shown to be unaffected by high protein and salt concentrations, but dependent upon the presence of calcium ions, and then correlated to the hydrolytic activity of membrane phospholipids. Importantly, we showed that stingray phospholipase A(2) group IIA presents no cytotoxicity after its incubation with MDA-MB-231 cells. SPLA(2)-IIA may be considered as a future therapeutic agent against bacterial infections.
