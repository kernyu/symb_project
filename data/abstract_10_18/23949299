INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of intestinal carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae and carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli in the community in Buenos Aires, Argentina. METHODOLOGY: Faecal samples from 164 non-hospitalized patients were cultured on CHROMagar KPC and CHROMagar ESBL plates. Isolates resistant to third-generation cephalosporins or carbapenems were selected for further study. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the isolates was determined using the E-test method. The phenotypic detection of ESBLs and carbapenemases was performed using the double-disc synergy test. RESULTS: The rate of faecal carriage of Enterobacteriaceae resistant to third-generation cephalosporins was 26.8%. Escherichia coli represented a large majority (75%) of the isolates recovered. Thirty-three ESBL-producing isolates were detected from 31 faecal samples (18.9% of the collected specimens). Eight carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli were recovered from eight specimens (4.9%). CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed a high prevalence of faecal carriage of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, including ESBLs, in Buenos Aires. Therefore, the use of surveillance cultures will be helpful for tracking and monitoring the spread of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae within community settings.
