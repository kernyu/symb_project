We assessed in a piglet model the relationship between fecal ciprofloxacin concentrations and ciprofloxacin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae counts. Twenty-nine piglets were orally treated with placebo or with 1.5 or 15 mg ciprofloxacin/kg of body weight/day from day 1 (D1) to D5. Areas under the curve (AUC) of concentrations increased sharply with dose and correlated positively with AUC of resistant bacteria log counts between D1 and D9. Removing residual colonic quinolones could help to control the emergence of resistance in fecal flora.
