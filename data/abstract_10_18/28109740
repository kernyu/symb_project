Recently, azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus containing a 34-bp or 46-bp tandem repeat in the promoter region of cyp51A combined with amino acid substitution(s) has appeared in the environment worldwide, including several Asian countries. In this study, we isolated the 34-bp tandem repeat-containing azole-resistant A. fumigatus strain OKH50 from a patient in Japan in May 2016. The patient had not been treated with medical azoles before the strain isolation, suggesting that the resistant property was acquired before infection. In addition, the patient had not traveled overseas. Our analysis of short tandem repeats of the strain indicates that the strain is strongly related to the 34-bp tandem repeat-containing isolates from European countries and Asia-Oceania countries but not to susceptible isolates from Japan, suggesting that the strain was introduced from overseas and might spread in Japan.
