Monitoring of the susceptibility of Mycoplasma bovis field isolates to antibiotics is important for the appropriate choice of treatment. However, in vitro susceptibility testing of mycoplasmas is technically demanding and time-consuming, especially for clinical isolates, and is rarely performed in mycoplasma diagnostic laboratories. Thus, the development of methods allowing rapid real-time detection of resistant strains of M. bovis in clinical samples is a high priority for successful treatment. In this study, a novel TaqMan single-nucleotide-polymorphism (SNP) real-time PCR assay, which enables the rapid identification of M. bovis strains with different susceptibilities to fluoroquinolones, was developed and evaluated. The TaqMan SNP real-time PCR assay is based on the amplification of a 97-bp fragment of the parC quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) and allows the specific detection of four possible genotypes: GAC or GAT (susceptible to fluoroquinolones) and AAC or AAT (resistant to fluoroquinolones). Four TaqMan minor groove binder (MGB) probes identifying 1-base mismatches were designed and applied in a dual-probe assay with two reaction tubes. The TaqMan SNP real-time PCRs developed are highly specific for M. bovis, with a detection limit of 5 fg/microl (about 5 M. bovis genomes). In addition, all four SNP real-time PCR tests have almost the same efficiency (97.7% [GAC], 94% [AAC], 99.99% [GAT], and 98% [AAT]). Taken together, the data suggest that this SNP real-time PCR assay has potential as a routine diagnostic test for the detection of decreased susceptibility of M. bovis to fluoroquinolones.
