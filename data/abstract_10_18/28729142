BACKGROUND: Central nervous system nocardial infection is a rarely reported disease that usually affects patients with predisposing and debilitating conditions but also the immunocompetent population. The most common variant affecting the brain is Nocardia farcinica. Management of brain nocardiosis is troublesome and requires consideration of the severity of the underlying systemic disease, the difficulties in identifying the bacterium, and the frequent delay in initiating adequate therapy. CASE DESCRIPTION: We present 3 cases of N. farcinica brain abscess (single, multiloculated, and multifocal) diagnosed in 3 patients with predisposing factors that could be successfully cured. The patients underwent craniotomy, evacuation of the purulent collection, and partial resection of the abscesses' walls. Confirmation of N. farcinica species was achieved using specific polymerase chain reaction sequencing of the 16S ribosome RNA gene. Antibiotic therapy was selected on susceptibility tests and was maintained for 10 months (1 case) and 12 months (2 cases). CONCLUSIONS: Brain nocardiosis needs to be suspected primarily (though not exclusively) in immunocompromised patients presenting with neurologic deficit and harboring intracerebral lesions resembling brain tumors. Early identification of the specific species is paramount in order to initiate long-term antibiotic therapy, acknowledging the inherent resistance of N. farcinica to third-generation cefalosporins and its susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole. According to the literature, surgical excision or aspiration of the brain abscess seems to provide good chances of eradication of the disease. In our experience, successful outcome was achieved with subtotal resection and prolonged and adequate antibiotic therapy.
