Mutations in PenA, PorB, MtrE and MtrR genes responsible for antimicrobial resistance were checked in 27 drug-resistant clinical isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG). Phenotype PIB (88.88%) and mutation at G120 and A121 positions of porB were recurrent. N122K, a novel mutation, was observed in PorB in three resistant isolates. Substitution H105Y in MtrR was widespread (37% of clinical isolates). The presence of a novel mutation (L33V), along with G45D mutation in MtrR, was associated with less-resistant isolates, in contrast to isolates with G45D mutation alone. African-type penicillinase-producing NG plasmid was observed most frequently (17/27) in penicillin-resistant isolates.
