INTRODUCTION: Plasmodium falciparum malaria is one of the world's most lethal infectious diseases, commanding millions of drug administrations per year. The pharmacogenetics of these drugs is poorly known, although its application can be pivotal for the optimized management of this disease. AREAS COVERED: The main components of artemisinin combination therapy (ACT), the worldwide main antimalarial strategy, are metabolized by the polymorphic CYP3A4 (mefloquine, artemether, lumefantrine), CYP2C8 (amodiaquine), CYP2A6 (artesunate) and CYP1A1/2 (amodiaquine/desethylamodiaquine), with dihydroartemisinin being acted by Phase II UDP-glucuronosyltransferases. The worldwide adoption of ACT is leading to a large number of antimalarial treatments. Simultaneously, the feared development of parasite drug resistance might drive dosing increases. In these scenarios of increased drug exposure, pharmacogenetics can be a key tool supporting evidence-based medicine aiming for the longest possible useful lifespan of this important chemotherapy. EXPERT OPINION: Translation in this moment is not operationally possible at an individual level, but large population studies are achievable for: i) the development of robust pharmacogenetics markers; and ii) the parallel development of a pharmacogenetic cartography of malaria settings. Advances in the understanding of antimalarial pharmacogenetics are urgent in order to protect the exposed populations, enhance the effectiveness of ACT and, consequently, contributing for the long aimed elimination of the disease.
