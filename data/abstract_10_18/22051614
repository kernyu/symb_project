Fungi, particularly yeasts, have become important opportunistic pathogens that can be resistant to antifungal agents or develop resistance. To address this problem, new molecules such as echinocandins, have been developed. Susceptibility to anidulafungin was studied in yeasts isolated previous to the introduction of this drug in Chile. One hundred strains of different yeast species isolated from invasive fungal infections during 2007 and 2008 were studied. Susceptibility testing of anidulafungin was performed by broth microdilution according to CLSI. All strains were susceptible to anidulafungin. MIC50 and MIC90 were 0.125 microg/mL and 1 microg/mL, respectively. Compared to other yeasts, C. parapsilosis showed a slight increase in the MICs for anidulafungin (MIC50, 1 microg/mL, MIC90, 2 microg/mL), but remained within the susceptible range. Both, fluconazole resistant (8) and dose dependent susceptible strains (16) were susceptible to anidulafungin. In vitro, this echinocandin appears to be an effective therapeutic alternative.
