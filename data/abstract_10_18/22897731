The purpose of the study was to assess treatment response and overall outcome in a cohort of patients with relapsed and refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma and to compare the results with those for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated in a similar manner. We retrospectively analyzed data of 40 consecutive adult patients with relapsed and refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma referred to our institution for consideration of second-line chemotherapy aiming for autologous stem cell transplant between January 1999 and December 2006. A cohort of 126 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma managed similarly served as a comparison group. Most (>/= 75%) patients received ESHAP (etoposide, methylprednisolone, cytarabine, cisplatin) or DHAP (cisplatin, cytosine arabinoside, dexamethasone) as salvage chemotherapy. From first relapse/progression, overall survival at 2 years was 54% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 38-76) for the peripheral T-cell lymphoma cohort and 49% (95% CI: 39-60) for the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cohort (p = 0.098). Overall response rate to salvage chemotherapy was similar between both groups (63% vs. 52%). Post-autologous stem cell transplant, 1-year progression-free survival was 20% (95% CI: 9-48) for patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma and 47% (95% CI: 36-61) for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Two-year overall survival post-autologous stem cell transplant was 43% (95% CI: 26-71) and 54% (95% CI: 43-68), respectively. Patients with relapsed and refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma showed a similar response to salvage chemotherapy and overall survival. Likely due to imbalances in risk factors at relapse, progression-free survival post-autologous stem cell transplant was inferior in the peripheral T-cell lymphoma group. Strategies aiming to maintain response duration post-autologous stem cell transplant could improve the outcome of patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma.
