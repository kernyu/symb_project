BACKGROUND: Isoniazid (INH) resistance is now the most common type of tuberculosis (TB) infection resistance worldwide. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients with low- and high-concentration INH-monoresistant TB. METHODS: One hundred and thirty-four patients with culture-confirmed INH-monoresistant TB during 2006 January to 2007 December were retrospectively enrolled. INH resistance was classified as either low-concentration or high-concentration resistance according to the critical concentrations of 0.2 microg/mL or 1 microg/mL of INH, respectively. The patients' clinical outcomes, treatment regimens, and treatment duration were analyzed. RESULTS: The treatment success rates between low- and high-concentration INH-resistant TB were similar (81.8% vs. 86.7%). The treatment regimens and treatment duration were similar between both groups. Only a minor percentage of the patients in both groups received 6-month treatment regimens (low vs. high concentration resistance, 9.1% vs. 13.3%; respectively, p = 0.447) The most common reason for treatment duration longer than 6 months was pyrazinamide given for less than 6 months, followed by a delay in clinical response to treatment. Multivariable analysis showed that prior tuberculosis treatment (Odds ratio, 2.82, 95% C.I., 1.02-7.77, p = 0.045) was the only independent risk factor for unsuccessful treatment outcome. CONCLUSION: Different levels of INH resistance did not affect the treatment outcomes of patients with INH-monoresistant tuberculosis. Prolonged Rifampin-containing regimens may achieve those good outcomes in patients with low- and high-concentration INH-monoresistant TB.
