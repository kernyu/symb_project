Essential facts Antimicrobial resistance develops when the medicines are used inappropriately. Global estimates suggest that every year more than 700,000 people die from drug-resistant strains of common bacterial and viral infections, such as the human immunodeficiency virus, tuberculosis and malaria. If antimicrobial resistance continues to increase, this number could rise to ten million a year by 2050.
