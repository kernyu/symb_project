The periodontal pathogen, Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277 has six gene clusters that encode tripartite drug efflux pumps. To examine the effects of the drug efflux pumps on its antibiotic sensitivity, six mutants were constructed, each defective in the membrane fusion protein gene of each gene cluster. Compared to the wild-type strain, all mutants exhibited an elevated sensitivity to tetracycline, and two mutants with deletions in the PGN_1431 and PGN_1680 genes showed an increased sensitivity to various types of antibiotics. These results suggest that the activity of drug efflux systems may affect antibiotic sensitivity in P. gingivalis.
