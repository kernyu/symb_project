BACKGROUND: Detecting a new effective and hypotoxic anticancer drug is an emerging new strategy for cancer chemotherapy. Doxycycline (DC) is a kind of antibiotics but also inhibits tumorigenesis. METHODS: MTT and cell invasion assay, flow cytometry, western-blot analysis and nude mice were used to investigate the effects and underlying mechanisms of doxycycline on epithelial ovarian cancer cells. RESULTS: Doxycycline inhibited the proliferation and invasion of SKOV3 and SKOV3/DDP; induced moderate apoptosis of SKOV3/DDP. CXCR4 expression at both mRNA and protein levels was downregulated in both cell lines when treated with doxycycline. Akt and ERK1/2 were involved in doxycycline effect on cell proliferation of SKOV3 but not of SKOV3/DDP. Akt and EKR1/2 phosphorylation were activated by SDF-1alpha, which was then inhibited by doxycycline in SKOV3. Pro-caspase-3 expression was significantly higher in SKOV3 than that in SKOV3/DDP which was upregulated when treated with doxycycline. In vivo, doxycycline inhibited peritoneal tumor xenograft and decreased malignant ascites. CONCLUSION: Doxycycline not only has an inhibitory effect on ovarian cancer, but also can increase sensitivity to cisplatin. SDF-1alpha/CXCR4-regulated Akt and ERK 1/2 activations are probably involved in the antitumor effect of doxycycline on SKOV3 cells, while upregulation of pro-caspase-3 may be the main mechanism involved in SKOV3/DDP cells.
