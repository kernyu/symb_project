Due to the persistent spread of antibiotic resistance, commercial antibiotic treatments are proving ineffective. Cinnamaldehyde (CA), a volatile essential oil, eradicates pathogens non-specifically. However, the ability to incorporate essential oils into nanofiber mats has not yet been demonstrated, and, only six studies have electrospun two immiscible phases. Here, CA (0.5 and 5.0%) was incorporated into chitosan/poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) solutions that were successfully electrospun into mats with approximately 50 nm fiber diameters. Solid-state NMR results corroborated with release studies wherein the 5.0% CA mats released a statistically higher amount of CA-liquid (545% more) and CA-vapor (279% more) than the 0.5% CA mats. In time dependent cytotoxicity studies, the intrinsic antibacterial activity of chitosan along with the quick release of CA enabled high inactivation rates against Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. For the first time we have demonstrated chitosan/CA/PEO nanofiber mats can serve as CA delivery vehicles that potentially eradicate pseudomonas infections.
