BACKGROUND: Recently, increasing antibiotic resistance is causing serious publichealth concerns worldwide. This phenomenon increased patient's morbidity and mortality rate, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. METHODS: Considering that antimicrobial resistance can vary according to geographical location, we investigated the status of antibiotic resistance in Ilam province from 2008 to 2013. RESULTS: The results of our study showed that antibiotic resistance rates to aztreonam, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone were 38%, 39%, 43% and 48% respectively. CONCLUSION: Antibiotic resistance had increased (except for aztreonam) during the period from 2008 to 2013.
