Travelers' diarrhea is a major public health problem. From patients in whom diarrhea developed after travel to India, 5 enteroaggregative Escherichia coli strains carrying beta-lactamase CTX-M-15 were identified; 3 belonged to clonal complex sequence type 38. This beta-lactamase contributes to the multidrug resistance of enteroaggregative E. coli, thereby limiting therapeutic alternatives.
