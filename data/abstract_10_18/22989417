Strain characteristics of 51 Shigella sonnei isolates obtained from children seeking medical care (MC) and 48 isolates recovered during a prospective diarrhoea birth cohort (BC) study were compared. Biochemical characterization and antibiotic susceptibility testing determined that all S. sonnei isolates were biotype g and multidrug-resistant. Plasmid profiling identified 15 closely related patterns and XbaI pulsed-field gel electrophoresis confirmed the high degree of genetic similarity between isolates. All S. sonnei isolates harboured ipaH and class II integrase genes and 843 and 80% of the MC and BC isolates, respectively carried the sen gene. Neither the class I integrase nor the set gene was detected. Our results indicate that S. sonnei isolates associated with severe diarrhoea were indistinguishable from those associated with mild diarrhoea. Additional genetic tests with greater discrimination might offer an opportunity to determine genetic differences within the globally disseminating biotype g clone.
