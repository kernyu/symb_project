OBJECTIVES: To determine the mechanism of intermediate- and high-level echinocandin resistance, resulting from heterozygous and homozygous mutations in GSC1 (FKS1), in both laboratory-generated and clinical isolates of Candida albicans. METHODS: The DNA sequences of the entire open reading frames of GSC1, GSL1 (FKS3) and RHO1, which may contribute to the beta-1,3-glucan synthase of a micafungin-susceptible strain and a resistant clinical isolate, were compared. A spontaneous heterozygous mutant isolated by selection for micafungin resistance, and a panel of laboratory-generated homozygous and heterozygous mutants that possessed combinations of the echinocandin-susceptible and -resistant alleles, or mutants with individual GSC1 alleles deleted, were used to compare levels of echinocandin resistance and inhibition of glucan synthase activity. RESULTS: DNA sequence analysis identified a mutation, S645P, in both alleles of GSC1 from the clinical isolate. GSL1 had two homozygous amino acid changes and five non-synonymous nucleotide polymorphisms due to allelic variation. The predicted amino acid sequence of Rho1p was conserved between strains. Reconstruction of the heterozygous (S645/S645F) and homozygous (S645F/S645F) mutation showed that the homozygous mutation conferred a higher level of micafungin resistance (4 mg/L) than the heterozygous mutation (1 mg/L). Exposure of the heterozygous mutant to micafungin resulted in a loss of heterozygosity. Kinetic analysis of beta-1,3-glucan synthase activity showed that the homozygous and heterozygous mutations gave echinocandin susceptibility profiles that correlated with their MIC values. CONCLUSIONS: A homozygous hot-spot mutation in GSC1, caused by mutation in one allele and then loss of heterozygosity, is required for high-level echinocandin resistance in C. albicans. Both alleles of GSC1 contribute equally and independently to beta-1,3-glucan synthase activity.
