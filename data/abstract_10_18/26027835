Tight junctions (TJs) of the epidermis play an important role in maintaining the epidermal barrier. TJ breakdown is associated with skin problems, such as wrinkles and transepidermal water loss (TEWL). Clinical studies have reported that topical nifedipine is effective in reducing the depth of wrinkles and improving TEWL. However, it remains unknown whether nifedipine influences the TJ function in the epidermis. In the present study, we investigated the effect of nifedipine on epidermal barrier dysfunction in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) treated with sodium caprate (C10), a TJ inhibitor. Nifedipine reversed the C10-decreased transepithelial electrical resistance values as a measure of disruption of the epidermal barrier. Immunocytochemical observations revealed that nifedipine improved the C10-induced irregular arrangement of claudin-1, a key protein in TJs. Taken together, these findings suggest that nifedipine prevents epidermal barrier dysfunction, at least in part, by reconstituting the irregular claudin-1 localization at TJs in C10-treated NHEKs.
