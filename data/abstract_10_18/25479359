Bacterial resistance is a serious threat to human health. The production of beta-lactamase, which inactivates beta-lactams is most common cause of resistance to the beta-lactam antibiotics. The Class A enzymes are most frequently encountered among the four beta-lactamases in the clinic isolates. Mutations in class A beta-lactamases play a crucial role in substrate and inhibitor specificity. SHV and TEM type are known to be most common class A beta-lactamases. In the present study, we have analyzed the effect of inhibitor resistant S130G point mutation of SHV type Class-A beta-lactamase using molecular dynamics and other in silico approaches. Our study involved the use of different in silico methods to investigate the affect of S130G point mutation on the major physico-chemical properties of SHV type class A beta-lactamase. We have used molecular dynamics approach to compare the dynamic behaviour of native and S130G mutant form of SHV beta-lactamase by analyzing different properties like root mean square deviation (RMSD), H-bond, Radius of gyration (Rg) and RMS fluctuation of mutation. The results clearly suggest notable loss in the stability of S130G mutant that may further lead to decrease in substrate specificity of SHV. Molecular docking further indicates that S130G mutation decreases the binding affinity of all the three inhibitors in clinical practice.
