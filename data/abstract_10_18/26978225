This study assessed the antimicrobial resistance of airborne Staphylococcus spp. strains isolated from healthcare facilities in southern Poland. A total of 55 isolates, belonging to 10 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) species, isolated from 10 healthcare facilities (including hospitals and outpatient units) were included in the analysis. The most frequently identified species were Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Staphylococcus warneri, which belong to normal human skin flora, but can also be the cause of common and even severe nosocomial infections. Disk diffusion tests showed that the bacterial strains were most frequently resistant to erythromycin and tetracycline and only 18% of strains were susceptible to all tested antimicrobials. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of specific gene regions was used to determine the presence of the Macrolide-Lincosamide-Streptogramin resistance mechanisms in CoNS. The molecular analysis, conducted using specific primer pairs, identified the msrA1 gene, encoding active efflux pumps in bacterial cells, as the most frequent resistance gene. As many as seven antibiotic resistance genes were found in one isolate, whereas the most common number of resistance genes per isolate was five (n = 17). It may be concluded that drug resistance was widely spread among the tested strains, but the resulting antimicrobial resistance profile indicates that in the case of infection, the use of antibiotics from the basic antibiogram group will be effective in therapy. However, before administering treatment, determination of the specific antimicrobial resistance should be conducted, particularly in the case of hospitalized patients.
