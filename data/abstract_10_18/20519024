Studies in several sub-Saharan African countries demonstrated that the expansion of antiretroviral therapy (ART) access is not only beneficial for people living with HIV, but also results in significant declines in tuberculosis and malaria incidence and prevalence, bolstering arguments for earlier and increased ART access and contributing to a growing understanding of co-epidemic dynamics. Several studies demonstrated that using standard triple-drug ART in resource-limited settings can reduce vertical transmission by as much as less than 1% if continued throughout breastfeeding.The Nevirapine Resistance Study (NEVEREST) results provided proof of concept that nevirapine could be used as part of a paediatric second-line regimen, despite exposure to nevirapine prophylaxis for vertical transmission, following successful suppression on a lopinavir/ritonavir-based regimen. A South African study found that high pre-treatment levels of inflammatory and coagulation markers were strong predictors of death, reflecting similar findings in high-income countries and reinforcing the shift towards viewing HIV as a chronic, inflammatory disease. An early study of a new integrase inhibitor (S/GSK1349572) indicated strong potency and limited cross-resistance with raltegravir, the only integrase inhibitor currently approved for treatment.
