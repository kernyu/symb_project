Due to the widespread occurrence of multidrug resistant microbes there is increasing interest in the use of novel nanostructured materials as antimicrobials. Specifically, metallic nanoparticles such as silver, copper, and gold have been deployed due to the multiple impacts they have on bacterial physiology. From this, many have concluded that such nanomaterials represent steep obstacles against the evolution of resistance. However, we have already shown that this view is fallacious. For this reason, the significance of our initial experiments are beginning to be recognized in the antimicrobial effects of nanomaterials literature. This recognition is not yet fully understood and here we further explain why nanomaterials research requires a more nuanced understanding of core microbial evolution principles.
