The anti-mycobacterial activities of nine series of dicarboxyl and tricarboxyl dendritic amphiphiles with one alkyl, two alkyl, and cholestanyl tails against Mycobacterium abscessus, Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium chelonae, Mycobacterium marinum and Mycobacterium smegmatis have been measured. The dendritic amphiphiles overcame the limited aqueous solubility of natural long-chain fatty acids, alcohols, and amines to enable profiling the susceptibilities of the different mycobacterial species to the physicochemical properties of these amphiphiles. Several dendritic amphiphiles showed strong anti-mycobacterial activity with high critical micelle concentrations and low hemolytic activities thereby offering platforms for the development of antibiotics of higher activity against nontuberculous mycobacteria.
