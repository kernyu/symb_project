Comparative evaluation of the recently developed chromogenic culture medium chromID OXA-48 (bioMerieux) with chromID CARBA (bioMerieux) and SUPERCARBA showed that chromID OXA-48 and SUPERCARBA media have the highest sensitivity for detection of OXA-48 producing Enterobacteriaceae (91% and 93%) comparatively to chromID CARBA (21 %). The chromID OXA-48 has the highest specificity, with 100%, as compared to 53% and 68% for the SUPERCARBA and chromID CARBA media for detecting those OXA-48 producers.
