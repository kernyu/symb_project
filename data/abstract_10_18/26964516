OBJECTIVE: We describe the development of a web platform that provides an updated record of the etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility of the different microorganisms responsible for urinary tract infections. METHODS: The MicrobDinamyc system (Francisco Soria Melguizo, SA, Madrid, Spain) is employed for the management of information derived from the urine culture results. The web application database automatically gathers the results of urine cultures conducted in the laboratory. RESULTS: Results. The user can consult the distribution of bacterial etiologies and antimicrobial susceptibilities in the different clinical settings during a specific time window. CONCLUSIONS: Using susceptibility data obtained in previous studies and stored on the web platform, it is possible to deduce the clinical activity of a given antibiotic in a specific setting.
