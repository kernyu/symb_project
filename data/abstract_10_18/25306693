In the article there are presented the results of a study of antibiotic resistance of Enterobacteriaceae isolated from water of Volga River delta. Found that all the investigated microflora was established to have acquired multiple antibiotic resistance in dependence on the season of the year and the inhabited area. Minimal antibiotic resistance of Enterobacteriaceae was registered to Tobramycin and Chloramphenicol, the maximal resistance--to Benzylpenicillinum and Ampicillin. The data indicate to the significant persistence of antibiotic-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in hydroecosystems of Volga River delta which can be used as markers of sanitary-epidemiological and ecological trouble of the freshwater hydroecosystems.
