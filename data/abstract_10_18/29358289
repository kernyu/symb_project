A novel 65.8-kb multidrug resistance transposon, designated as Tn6450, was characterized in a Proteus mirabilis isolate from chicken in China. Tn6450 contains 18 different antimicrobial resistance genes, including cephalosporinase gene blaDHA-1 and fluoroquinolones resistance genes qnrA1 and aac(6' )-Ib-cr It carries a class 1/2 hybrid integron composed of intI2 and 3' conserved segment of class 1 integron. Tn6450 is derived from Tn7 via acquisition of new mobile elements and resistance genes.
