Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and b-defensins (BD) molecules are group of molecules that recognize various microbial components and play a crucial role in the activation of the innate immune system in vertebrate species. Although TLRs gene expression has been studied in various pig tissues, little is known about their expression in porcine reproductive tract. Concerning b-defensins genes, only BD1, 2 and 3 counterparts have been well studied in pigs' reproductive organs. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression pattern of both gene families in pigs' male and female reproductive organs, and embryos, as potential tool for further association studies in respect to immunity and disease resistance. RT-PCR analysis revealed that all of the examined TLR genes were expressed in the reproductive organs of male and female pigs, with TLR3 and TLR5 showing the higher levels and TLR9 the lowest, in all analyzed tissues. BD genes showed a different expression pattern in respect to the examined tissue. In embryos, TLR1 revealed high expression levels, while only BD3, BD108, and BD123 were found to be expressed.
