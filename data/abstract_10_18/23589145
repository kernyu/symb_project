BACKGROUND: Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) plays important roles in the progression of pancreatic cancer. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. AIMS: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of IGF1R knockdown on the proliferation, apoptosis and chemosensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells, and explore the possible mechanisms. METHODS: Pancreatic cancer cells expressing IGF1R shRNA were established, and the cell proliferation, colony formation, and chemosensitivity to gemcitabine were examined in vitro. The activation of AKT and NF-kappaB was detected by Western blot analysis and luciferase assay, respectively. Xenograft mice models were established to evaluate the in vivo anti-tumor effects of IGF1R knockdown. RESULTS: IGF1R knockdown notably inhibited pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and colony formation, induced apoptosis, and inhibited xenograft tumor growth. Moreover, IGF1R knockdown significantly enhanced chemosensitivity to gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer cells, and this was correlated with the inhibition of PI3K/AKT and NF-kappaB pathways. CONCLUSIONS: IGF1R knockdown suppresses tumor growth and enhances chemosensitivity in pancreatic cancer via the inhibition of PI3K/AKT and NF-kappaB pathways, and is a promising approach to overcome the chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer.
