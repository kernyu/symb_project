CD8(+) T cells specific to caspase-cleaved antigens derived from apoptotic T cells represent a principal player in chronic immune activation. Here, we found that both apoptotic epitope-specific and hepatitis C virus (HCV)-specific CD8(+) T cells were mostly confined within the effector memory (EM) or terminally differentiated EM CD45RA(+) cell subsets expressing a dysfunctional T-helper 1-like signature program in chronic HCV infection. However, apoptotic epitope-specific CD8(+) T cells produced tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 2 at the intrahepatic level significantly more than HCV-specific CD8(+) T cells, despite both populations expressing high levels of programmed death 1 receptor. Contextually, only apoptotic epitope-specific CD8(+) T cells correlated with both interferon-stimulated gene levels in T cells and hepatic fibrosis score. Together, these data suggest that, compared with HCV-specific CD8(+) T cells, apoptotic epitope-specific CD8(+) T cells can better sustain chronic immune activation, owing to their capacity to produce tumor necrosis factor alpha, and exhibit greater resistance to inhibitory signals during chronic HCV infection.
