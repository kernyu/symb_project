Interest in simplification arises from the need to dispense with nucleoside analogs due to their long-term toxicity. Since the first trials analyzing the safety and effectiveness of the strategy with lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) emerged more than 10 years ago, simplification continues to arouse scientific, clinical and economic interest. At present, there is no consensus on recommendations; interpretations of results are discordant: while some emphasize the greater risk of loss of virologic control, others indicate that the possible virological rebound with this strategy is unrelated to a loss of therapeutic options or to the emergence of resistance to ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors. This scenario governs the recommendations that can be made in clinical practice; almost all groups agree that candidates should be selected for a simplification strategy with fewer drugs.
