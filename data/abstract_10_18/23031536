Aeromonas species, aquatic Gram-negative bacilli, distributed globally and ubiquitously in the natural environment, may be implicated in a variety of human diseases. They can produce various beta-lactamases which confer resistance to a broad spectrum of beta-lactams, and therefore in vitro susceptibility testing must be used to guide antimicrobial therapy. However, conventional in vitro susceptibility tests may sometimes fail to detect these beta-lactamases, and hence raise a therapeutic challenge. In this review article, two chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases (i.e., AmpC beta-lactamases and metallo-beta-lactamases) and acquired extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in aeromonads are reviewed, and the clinical implications of the complexity of beta-lactamases are discussed.
