BACKGROUND: A flow cytometric method is proposed to study in vitro drug sensitivity of Plasmodium falciparum. Standard [(3)H]-hypoxanthine incorporation assay gives only information on inhibition of maturation by drugs. This method is usable on field isolates and provides data on both inhibition of maturation and re-invasion. METHODS: The method is based on the staining of parasites with hydroethidine (HE) and thiazole orange (TO) which allow differential identification of early, trophozoite and late stage of the parasite by flow cytometry. Late stages of the parasites are obtained by incubation in culture for 24 hours. Reinvasion is followed by culturing parasitized red blood cells for 24 h more. RESULTS: Compared to the standard [(3)H]-hypoxanthine incorporation assay, it gave similar results as expressed by 50% inhibitory concentrations for chloroquine of laboratory strains and "field" isolates. The effect of quinine on the schizont-ring transition was also explored using this method. First data on the inhibition of re-invasion induced by quinine are presented for both P. falciparum-cultured strains and field isolates. DISCUSSION: This method is simple to use event for field isolate study. It is suitable to analyse effect of drugs on steps of the parasite life cycle different for the maturation one. Using this method quinine was found to have a inhibitory effect on re-invasion of red cells by Plasmodium.
