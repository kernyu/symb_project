BACKGROUND AND AIM: Response to interferon therapy and disease progression in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected patients differs among individuals, suggesting a possibility of a contribution of host genetic factors. 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), an important component of the innate immune system with a proven antiviral function, may therefore have a relationship with the response to interferon therapy and clinical course of HCV disease. Our aim was to determine the frequency of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at exon 7 splice acceptor site (SAS) of the OAS1 gene in relation to the interferon response and status of HCV infection. METHODS: A 203 bp fragment containing exon 7 SAS was amplified in 70 HCV chronic patients and 50 healthy controls. SNP was examined using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) genotyping method. Correlations of SNP genotypes with response to interferon and clinical status of patients were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: There was an increasing trend of response from AA to AG to GG genotypes (P = 0.007). Genotype AA was associated with non-response to interferon and higher degree of liver fibrosis (P = 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed this SNP as independent and a significant determinant of the outcome of interferon therapy (odds ratio 4.913 [95% confidence interval 1.365-8.2], P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show a significant association between the functional SNP at exon 7 SAS of OAS1 gene and the viral response to interferon in chronic HCV patients. Patients with AA genotype were associated with progressive HCV disease and viral resistance to interferon therapy. This OAS SNP is a potential bio-marker to predict IFN response in chronic hepatitis C patients.
