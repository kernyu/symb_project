BACKGROUND: Most herpes simplex virus (HSV) isolates from treatment-naive patients are susceptible to antivirals. However, prolonged antiviral therapy can select for drug-resistant strains, especially in immunocompromised patients. Standard phenotypic methods for antiviral resistance testing are labor and time-intense and molecular resistance determinants are insufficiently understood for routine diagnostic use of genotypic resistance testing. OBJECTIVE: To enable rapid, scalable antiviral susceptibility testing and minimize viral passage, we developed a 7-day, 96-well assay for simultaneous HSV 1/2 titration and phenotypic resistance testing for acyclovir and foscarnet. STUDY DESIGN: The assay was optimized and validated by testing clinical isolates and laboratory strains (n=39) with known IC50 for acyclovir (23 resistant) and foscarnet (1 resistant) based on plaque reduction or dye-uptake assays. A chemiluminescent detection reagent is used for quantification of cytopathic effect instead of plaque counting or measuring dye-uptake. Drug concentrations inhibiting 50% of chemiluminescent signal reduction (IC50) were determined concurrently at each of three virus dilutions. RESULTS: Results agree for 92.3% (acyclovir) and 100% (foscarnet) of isolates. For all three discordant samples, results of reference testing by plaque reduction agreed with the chemiluminescent assay. Reproducibility studies showed 100% qualitative agreement and 3-37% coefficient of variation based on IC50. CONCLUSIONS: Chemiluminescence detection as a surrogate for cellular viability with an automated plate reader provides improved throughput and workflow, as well as high accuracy and reproducibility for antiviral drug susceptibility testing.
