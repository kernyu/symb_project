We investigated the prevalence and characteristics of Escherichia coli sequence type 131 (ST131) and its subclones among 268 E. coli isolates. The isolates were collected from 21 Korean hospitals without use of selection criteria and were screened for ST131 status by PCR. ST131 isolates were characterized for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase variants, fluoroquinolone resistance genes, plasmid addiction systems, and replicon types. The collection's 57 identified ST131 isolates (21% of 268) were distributed disproportionately by clonal subset, as follows: 21 (37%) H30Rx, 27 (47%) H30 non-Rx, and 8 (14%) non-H30. Most (93%) ST131 isolates were ciprofloxacin resistant, and all H30 isolates had the same 5 nonsynonymous mutations in gyrA, parC, and parE. Twenty (95%) of H30Rx isolates harbored CTX-M-15, whereas only 14 (52%) of H30 non-Rx isolates harbored CTX-M-14 or CTX-M-27. Most (97%) ST131 isolates harbored IncF plasmids, but vagCD was confined exclusively to H30Rx. Our findings suggest that the distinctive characteristics of H30Rx isolates could have contributed to this subclone's recent epidemiologic success.
