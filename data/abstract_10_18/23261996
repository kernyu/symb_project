Due to world-wide spread of hypervirulent and antibiotic resistant Clostridium difficile strains, the incidence of these infections are dramatically increasing in Hungary with appalling mortality and recurrence rates. Authors present a case of a 59-year-old patient who developed a severe, relapsing pseudomembranous colitis after antibiotic treatment. Life-threatening symptoms of fulminant colitis were successfully treated with prolonged administration of metronidazole and vancomycin, careful supportive therapy and weeks of intensive care. However, a well-documented, severe relapse developed within a week and this time faecal bacteriotherapy was performed. This treatment resulted in a complete cure without any further antibiotic treatment. In relation to this life-saving faecal transplantation, methodology and indications are briefly discussed. In addition, microbiological issues, epidemiological data and threats associated with antibiotic treatment of Clostridium difficile infections are also covered. Finally, relevant professional societies are urged to prepare a national protocol for faecal transplantation, which could allow introduction of this valuable, cost-effective procedure into the routine clinical practice.
