Resistance of Gram-positive pathogens to first-line antimicrobial agents has been increasing in many parts of the world. We compared the in vitro activities of torezolid with those of other antimicrobial agents, including linezolid, against clinical isolates of major aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Torezolid had an MIC(90) of </=0.5 mug/ml for the Gram-positive bacterial isolates tested and was more potent than either linezolid or vancomycin.
