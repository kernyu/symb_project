The aim of the present study was to determine viral subtypes and resistance mutations to antiretroviral treatment (ART) in HIV-1-infected treatment-naive patients from Rabat, Morocco during the period 2005-2009. The protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) genes were sequenced, the phylogenetic trees were inferred, and the resistance-associated mutations to NRTIs, NNRTIs, and PIs were recorded according to the international list of surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs). The viral subtypes were subtype B (74%), CRF02_AG (15%), A1 (6%), C (2%), F1 (1%), CRF09 (1%), and CRF25_cpx (1%). The presence of DRMs was found in four (5.06%) of 91 patients; resistance mutations to NRTIs were M184V and T215I/S revertant mutations; resistance to NNRTIs was associated with K103N and resistance to PIs with V82A. These findings have relevant implications for the local molecular mapping of HIV-1 and future ART surveillance studies in the region.
