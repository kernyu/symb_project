The paper describes the specific features of the 2009-2010 epidemic season in Russia and the world, which are due to the wide spread of a new pandemic strain of influenza A(H1N1)v virus. There is an unusual early upsurge in the incidence of influenza and acute respiratory viral infection (ARVI) (in October-November 2009) with its peak at weeks 45 to 48 of the year with a succeeding reduction to the seasonal values by its end. The circulation of influenza B virus strains was recorded in February-April 2010, which was responsible for the higher epidemic thresholds of morbidity in a number of Russia's regions. A study of the antigenic properties of the strains defined their relationship to the reference strains A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)v and B/Brisbene/60/2008. There were strains with amino acid substitutions at position 222 of hemagglutinin in the population of pandemic influenza A(H1N1)v virus. The strains of the new pandemic influenza A(H1N1)v virus were resistant to remantadine and susceptible to oseltamivir, zanamivir, and arbidol. The influenza B virus strains were susceptible to oseltamivir, zanamivir, and arbidol. The proportion of pathogens of some ARVIs was as follows: parainfluenza viruses, 9.8%; adenoviruses, 5.5%; respiratory syncytial virus, 4.8%; and Mycoplasma pneumonia, 0.6%. There is evidence that there is a need for further monitoring of influenza viruses in Russia.
