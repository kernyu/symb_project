OBJECTIVE: To investigate the changes of sensitivity to praziquantel (PZQ) about PZQ-resistant isolates of Schistosoma japonicum established in laboratory by means of the resistance-inducement method during the stages of adult worms, cercariae and miracidia, so as to provide the basis for establishing the sensitivity-detecting technique to praziquantel. METHODS: A Jiangsu laboratory-maintaining isolate and a Hunan field-collecting isolate of S. japonicum that were never treated with PZQ were as PZQ-susceptible isolates, and two PZQ-induced isolates that were established via drug-treated passage in laboratory were as PZQ-resistant isolates. Mice were infected with S. japonicum cercariae collected from above four isolates each. Thirty-five days after the infection, the mice were divided into 6 groups and administered orally with PZQ at dosages of 0, 37.5, 75, 150, 300 mg/kg and 600 mg/kg, respectively. All the mice were sacrificed two weeks after the treatment, and all the adult worms in the hepatic and portomesenteric veins were recovered and counted. The mean worm burden and reductions were calculated and input into Graphpad Prism 5.0 software, and the PZQ ED50 values of four isolates were calculated by the software. The cercariae of above four isolates were exposed to 10(-5), 5 x 10(-6), 10(-6), 5 x 10(-7), 10(-7) mol/L PZQ solutions for 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 min and the changes of tail shedding were observed under a dissecting microscope, then the tail shedding rates of cercariae were calculated. The miracidia of above four isolates were exposed to 5 x 10(-6), 10(-6), 5 x 10(-7), 10(-7) mol/L PZQ solutions for 1, 3 and 5 min and the morphological changes were observed under a dissecting microscope, then the morphological change rates of miracidia were calculated. RESULTS: The PZQ ED50 values of PZQ-susceptible and PZQ-resistant isolates of Jiangsu were 147.7 mg/kg and 565.5 mg/kg, respectively, and the PZQ ED50 values of PZQ-susceptible and PZQ-resistant isolates of Hunan were 151.8 mg/kg and 467.2 mg/kg, respectively. When the cercariae were exposed to 10(-5) mol/L PZQ solution over 20 min, the tail shedding rate of cercariae from PZQ-susceptible isolate of Jiangsu was 68.8%, and the tail shedding rate of cercariae from PZQ-resistant isolate of Jiangsu was 38.2% (P < 0.01). When the cercariae were exposed to 10(-7) mol/L PZQ solution over 100 min, the tail shedding rate of cercariae from PZQ-susceptible isolate of Jiangsu was 15.9%, and the tail shedding rate of cercariae from PZQ-resistant isolate of Jiangsu was 6.7% (P < 0.01). When the cercariae were exposed to 10(-5) mol/L PZQ solution over 20 min, the tail shedding rates of cercariae from PZQ-susceptible isolate of Hunan was 59.4%, and the tail shedding rates of cercariae from PZQ-resistant isolate of Hunan was 54.6% (P < 0.05). When the cercariae were exposed to 5 x 10(-7) mol/L PZQ solution over 40 min, the tail shedding rates of cercariae from PZQ-susceptible isolate of Jiangsu was 34.3%, and the tail shedding rates of cercariae from PZQ-resistant isolate of Jiangsu was 18.4% (P < 0.01). When the miracidia were exposed to 5 x 10(-7) mol/L and 10(-7) mol/L PZQ solutions for 1, 3 and 5 min respectively, the morphological change rates of miracidia from PZQ-susceptible isolates of Jiangsu and Hunan were significantly higher than those of PZQ-resistant isolates (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: PZQ-resistant isolates of S. japonicum has been established in mice with sub-curative doses of PZQ by artificial selection in laboratory, and their sensitivities to PZQ are significantly lower than those of the isolates never treated with PZQ. The drug-resistance could exhibit in the stages of adult worms, cercariae and miracidia. The PZQ ED50 value of adult worms, the tail shedding rates of cercariae and the morphological change rates of miracidia as quantitative indicators can be used for monitoring the S. japonicum sensitivity to PZQ.
