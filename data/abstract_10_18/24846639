BACKGROUND: Resistance to second-line antituberculosis drugs (SLDs) severely compromises treatment options of drug-resistant tuberculosis. We assessed the association between acquisition of resistance (AR) to second-line injectable drugs (SLIs) or fluoroquinolones (FQs) and mortality among tuberculosis cases confirmed by positive culture results with available initial and final drug susceptibility test (DST) results. METHODS: We analyzed data from the US National Tuberculosis Surveillance System, 1993-2008. Acquired resistance was defined as drug susceptibility at initial DST but resistance to the same drug at final DST. We compared survival with Kaplan-Meier curves and analyzed the association between AR and mortality using a univariate extended Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for age. RESULTS: Of 2329 cases with both initial and final DSTs to SLIs, 49 (2.1%) acquired resistance; 13 of 49 (26.5%) had treatment terminated by death compared with 222 (10.0%) of those without AR to SLIs (P < .001). Of 1187 cases with both initial and final DSTs to FQs, 32 (2.8%) acquired resistance; 12 of 32 (37.5%) had treatment terminated by death compared with 121 (10.9%) of those without AR to FQs (P = .001). Controlling for age, mortality was significantly greater among cases with AR to SLDs than among cases without AR (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] for SLIs: 2.8; 95% confidence interval [CI],1.4-5.4; aHR for FQ: 1.9; 95% CI, 1.0-3.5). Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis at treatment initiation, positive human immunodeficiency virus status, and extrapulmonary disease were also significantly associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality was significantly greater among tuberculosis cases with AR to SLDs. Providers should consider AR to SLDs early in treatment, monitor DST results, and avoid premature deaths.
