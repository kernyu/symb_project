Cronobacter sakazakii is an opportunistic pathogen transmitted by food that affects mainly newborns, infants, and immune-compromised adults. In this study, the antibacterial activity of ferulic acid was tested against C. sakazakii strains. Minimum inhibitory concentration of ferulic acid against C. sakazakii strains was determined using the agar dilution method. Changes in intracellular pH, membrane potential and intracellular ATP concentration were measured to elucidate the possible antibacterial mechanism. Moreover, SYTO 9 nucleic acid staining was used to assess the effect of ferulic acid on bacterial membrane integrity. Cell morphology changes were observed under a field emission scanning electron microscope. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of ferulic acid against C. sakazakii strains ranged from 2.5 to 5.0 mg/mL. Addition of ferulic acid exerted an immediate and sustained inhibition of C. sakazakii proliferation. Ferulic acid affected the membrane integrity of C. sakazakii, as evidenced by intracellular ATP concentration decrease. Moreover, reduction of intracellular pH and cell membrane hyperpolarization were detected in C. sakazakii after exposure to ferulic acid. Reduction of green fluorescence indicated the injury of cell membrane. Electronic microscopy confirmed that cell membrane of C. sakazakii was damaged by ferulic acid. Our results demonstrate that ferulic acid has moderate antimicrobial activity against C. sakazakii. It exerts its antimicrobial action partly through causing cell membrane dysfunction and changes in cellular morphology. Considering its antimicrobial properties, together with its well-known nutritional functions, ferulic acid has potential to be developed as a supplement in infant formula or other foods to control C. sakazakii.
