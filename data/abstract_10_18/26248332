OBJECTIVES: Staphylococcus lugdunensis can cause community- and healthcare-associated infections. This study investigated the molecular characteristics of S. lugdunensis isolates collected at our hospital and compared the characteristics of the infectious and commensal isolates. METHODS: We collected the S. lugdunensis isolates between 2003 and 2013. The antimicrobial resistance test, SCCmec typing, accessory gene regulator (agr) typing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and delta-like hemolysin activity were performed. RESULTS: In total, 118 S. lugdunensis isolates were collected, of which 67 (56.8%) were classified into the infection group and 51 (43.2%) into the commensal group. The oxacillin resistance rate was 36.4%. The most common SCCmec types were SCCmec types V (51.4%) and II (32.6%). In total, 34 pulsotypes were identified. The PFGE typing revealed five clones (pulsotypes A, J, M, N, and P) at our hospital. Pulsotypes A and N caused the spread of high oxacillin resistance. In total, 10.2% (12 of 118) of the isolates lacked delta-like hemolysin activity. Compared with the infection group, the commensal group showed a higher percentage of multiple drug resistance and carried a higher percentage of SCCmec type II (11 of 22, 50% and 3 of 21, 14.3%) and a lower percentage of SCCmec type V (8 of 22, 36.4% and 14 of 21, 66.7%). The commensal group (27 PFGE types) showed higher genetic diversity than did the infection group (20 PFGE types). No difference was observed in the distribution of the five main pulsotypes, agr typing, and the presence of delta-like hemolysin activity between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Five main clones were identified at our hospital. The commensal group showed higher genetic diversity, had a higher percentage of multidrug resistance, and carried a higher percentage of SCCmec type II and a lower percentage of SCCmec type V than did the infection group.
