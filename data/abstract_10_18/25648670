BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus lugdunensis has emerged as a key pathogen for clinical infection. It is sensitive to most antistaphylococcal agents, but it is increasingly resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. Oxacillin-resistant S. lugdunensis isolates carrying the mecA gene pose a major concern for therapy failure. METHODS: To assess the epidemiology and presence of mecA in S. lugdunensis, we gauged the prevalence and antibiotic resistance of S. lugdunensis in clinical specimens by using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: Thirty S. lugdunensis isolates were collected and examined between October 2009 and December 2010. The resistance to penicillin (87%) and oxacillin (20%) was noted. All oxacillin-resistant isolates (6/30) had type V or VT SCCmec. Most (67%, 4/6) isolates carried SCCmec type V. These organisms caused invasive infections such as peritonitis, osteomyelitis, and septic arthritis. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analyses showed most (83%, 5/6) isolates carrying mecA were pulsotype D with high similarity (93.8%). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest oxacillin-resistant S. lugdunensis carrying SCCmec type V is emerging in central Taiwan.
