In this study, 908 bacterial pathogens from defined infections of dogs and cats were tested for their susceptibility to the novel fluoroquinolone pradofloxacin, which was approved in 2011 for use in cats and dogs. Most of the bacteria tested (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, Escherichia coli, beta-haemolytic streptococci, Pasteurella multocida and Bordetella bronchiseptica) exhibited low pradofloxacin MIC(90) values of </= 0.25 mug/ml. Solely Proteus spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa had higher MIC(90) values of >/= 4 mug/ml. Only six (3.4%) of 177 S. pseudintermedius and 12 (5.3%) of 227 E. coli isolates showed pradofloxacin MICs of >/= 2 mug/ml. Analysis of the quinolone resistance determining regions of the target genes identified double mutations in GyrA that resulted in amino acid exchanges S83L+D87N or S83L+D87Y and single or double mutations in ParC that resulted in amino acid exchanges S80I or S80I+E84G in all 12 E. coli isolates. The six S. pseudintermedius isolates exhibited amino acid exchanges S84L or E88K in GyrA and S80I in GrlA. Comparative analysis of the MICs of pradofloxacin and the MICs determined for enrofloxacin and its main metabolite ciprofloxacin, but also marbofloxacin, orbifloxacin, difloxacin and ibafloxacin was conducted for the target pathogens S. pseudintermedius, E. coli and P. multocida. This comparison confirmed that pradofloxacin MICs were significantly lower than those of the other tested fluoroquinolones.
