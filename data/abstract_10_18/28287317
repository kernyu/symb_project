Cancer cell resistance to chemotherapy is one of the obstacles for better cancer treatment, and inflammatory signaling pathways, such as NF-kappaB signaling pathway, have been recognized to be involved in such chemoresistance. In this study, we aim to identify a new approach for overcoming cancer chemoresistance by using natural compounds. As a result of screening by using Murine B16F10 melanoma cell line constitutively expressing NF-kappaB luciferase reporter gene, we identified Saikosaponin B2 as an effective inhibitor for etoposide-induced NF-kappaB activation in B16F10NFkB cells. Saikosaponin B2 sensitized etoposide-induced cell death in B16F10 melanoma cells through the induction of apoptosis. Along with apoptosis induction, we observed an induction of gamma-H2AX expression, which is a molecular signature for DNA damage, upon the combination treatment of etoposide and Saikosaponin B2. Among Saikosaponin family compounds, we found that Saikosaponin B1, but not Saikosaponin A, sensitized etoposide-induced cytotoxicity implicating the structural requirement of Saikosaponin B for such chemosensitization. By testing the combination of Saikosaponin B1 and B2 with 9 clinical anticancer drugs, Saikosaponin B showed a certain preference in the combination with those tested anticancer drugs. Collectively, we conclude Saikosaponin B can be an attractive adjuvant for enhancing the clinical effect of cancer chemotherapy.
