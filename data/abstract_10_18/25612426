In recent years, with the constant increase in the population with hypoimmunity, bacterial and fungal infections have been increasing. Due to the drug resistance, clinically optional anti-bacterial and antifungal medicines become increasingly limited. Scutellaria baicalensis, a species of perennial herbaceous plant of scutellaria genus of lamiaceae family, and its effective components have multiple pharmacological effects such as anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation, anti-tumor, anti-microbial. Especially, its remarkable antibacterial and antifungal activities are of great significance to treat the increasing number of cases with drug-fast bacterial and antifungal infections. In this paper, the authors summarized the advance in studies on antibacterial and antifungal effects and mechanisms in recent years on the basis of the domestic and foreign studies on S. baicalensis and its effective ingredients.
