A novel anti-varicella-zoster virus compound, a derivative of pyrazolo[1,5-c]1,3,5-triazin-4-one (coded as 35B2), was identified from a library of 9,600 random compounds. This compound inhibited both acyclovir (ACV)-resistant and -sensitive strains. In a plaque reduction assay under conditions in which the 50% effective concentration of ACV against the vaccine Oka strain (V-Oka) in human fibroblasts was 4.25 muM, the 50% effective concentration of 35B2 was 0.75 muM. The selective index of the compound was more than 200. Treatment with 35B2 inhibited neither immediate-early gene expression nor viral DNA synthesis. Twenty-four virus clones resistant to 35B2 were isolated, all of which had a mutation(s) in the amino acid sequence of open reading frame 40 (ORF40), which encodes the major capsid protein (MCP). Most of the mutations were located in the regions corresponding to the "floor" domain of the MCP of herpes simplex virus 1. Treatment with 35B2 changed the localization of MCP in the fibroblasts infected with V-Oka but not in the fibroblasts infected with the resistant clones, although it did not affect steady-state levels of MCP. Overexpression of the scaffold proteins restored the normal MCP localization in the 35B2-treated infected cells. The compound did not inhibit the scaffold protein-mediated translocation of MCP from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Electron microscopic analysis demonstrated the lack of capsid formation in the 35B2-treated infected cells. These data indicate the feasibility of developing a new class of antivirals that target the herpesvirus MCPs and inhibit normal capsid formation by a mechanism that differs from those of the known protease and encapsidation inhibitors. Further biochemical studies are required to clarify the precise antiviral mechanism.
