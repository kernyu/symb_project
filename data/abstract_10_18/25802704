BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Shigellosis is an acute gastroenteritis that is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in children with diarrhea in developing countries. The purpose of this study was to describe the distribution of Shigella serogroups and serotypes and their antibacterial drug resistance profiles. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fecal samples of all children suffering from shigellosis who had been admitted to Abuzar Children's Hospital in Ahvaz, southwestern Iran, from September 2008 to August 2010 were examined. Antibiotics susceptibility testing was performed according to the Kirby Bauer disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Shigella flexneri was the predominant serogroup and being identified in 87 isolates (49.8%). The most common S. flexneri serotypes were type 2 (57.5%) and type 1 (21.8%). High rates of resistance were observed to trimethoprime-sulfamethpxazole (85%) and ampicillin (87.5%). CONCLUSION: S. flexneri and its serotypes was the most frequently isolated Shigella species from southwest of Iran, Ahvaz. Identification of predominant S. flexneri serotypes in developing countries can help in prioritizing strategies such as development of effective vaccines.
