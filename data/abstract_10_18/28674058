We identified a novel 6-benzyl ether benzoxaborole with potent activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis The compound had an MIC of 2 muM in liquid medium. The compound was also able to prevent growth on solid medium at 0.8 muM and was active against intracellular bacteria (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50] = 3.6 muM) without cytotoxicity against eukaryotic cells (IC50 > 100 muM). We isolated resistant mutants (MIC >/= 100 muM), which had mutations in Rv1683, Rv3068c, and Rv0047c.
