Macrolides are an important tool in the treatment of Mycobacterium avium complex infections. Here, we evaluate the use of 23S rRNA gene sequencing for the rapid detection of macrolide resistance. Routine sequencing of the 23S rRNA gene is highly specific for macrolide resistance but lacks in sensitivity.
