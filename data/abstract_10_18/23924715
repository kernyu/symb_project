We have developed a new series of R4L1 Gateway binary vectors (R4L1pGWB), which carry the bialaphos resistance gene (bar) or the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:dolichol phosphate N-acetylglucosamine-1-P transferase (GPT) gene as selection markers that confer BASTA(R) and tunicamycin resistance on plants respectively. R4L1pGWBs have an attR4-attL1-reporter and can accept an attL4-promoter-attR1 entry clone for easy construction of an attB4-promoter-attB1-reporter clone. The new R4L1pGWBs facilitate promoter:reporter analysis in pre-existing transgenic plants that are resistant to kanamycin or hygromycin.
