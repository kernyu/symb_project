The objective of the study is to determine the prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from burn patients, antibiotic resistance pattern and occurrence of acquired MBL-producing P. aeruginosa among isolates collected from burn patients. In this study, two phenotypic methods were used for the detection of MBL-producing P. aeruginosa: zone enhancement with EDTA-impregnated imipenem and ceftazidime discs, and modified Hodge test. One hundred fifty-four isolates of P. aeruginosa were obtained from July 2007 to July 2008. Infection was increased up to 95% in hospitalized patients for >50 days. Highest infection of 39% was found in patients, who had 41 to 50% of burn area followed by 19% in patients with 31 to 40% of burn area. The most common bacteria isolated were P. aeruginosa (55.0%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (19.29%) and Klebsiella spp. (11.43%). Sixteen percent isolates of P. aeruginosa were positive for metallo-beta-lactamase production by both methods. Antibiotic resistance pattern of MBL-positive strains showed the highest resistance to ceftazidime (70%) followed by chloramphenicol (68%) and gentamicin (62.5%). Routine detection of MBLs ensuring optimal patient care and careful in vitro testing before antibiotic use may help in the prevention and treatment of burn patients infected with metallo-beta- lactamase-producing P. aeruginosa.
