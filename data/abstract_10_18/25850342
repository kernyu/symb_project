To investigate the antibacterial resistance to doripenem in China and to understand the distribution trends of resistant bacteria. All the clinical isolates were collected from hospitals and the susceptibility tests were performed using the agar dilution method recommended by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) central laboratory. The susceptibility of the isolates to antimicrobial agents was determined using the CLSI (2014) or European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) (2013) guidelines. A total of 4047 pathogenic strains were isolated from 18 tertiary hospitals in 18 cities across China between July 2011 and June 2012. MIC results indicated that the vast majority of Enterobacteriaceae maintained high susceptibility to doripenem, with a lower resistance rate (1.9%) than that observed for other drugs tested. In the case of non-fermenting Gram-negative isolates, the resistance rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 16.2%, which was less than that of imipenem and meropenem, and the Acinetobacter baumannii doripenem resistance rate was 67.4%. Doripenem also showed good in vitro activity against other the bacteria tested. This study suggests that the gradual increase in carbapenem nonsusceptible Enterobacteriaceae should be monitored carefully alongside the increasing multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant A. baumannii.
