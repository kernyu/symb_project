Lactobacillus strains have been considered good candidates as biological control agents for prevention or treatment of plant and animal infections. One L. plantarum strain FB003 and three strains (FB011, FB081, and FB110) which closed to L. sakei were isolated from fermented and salted shrimp and their abilities in inhibiting growth of Vibrio parahaemolyticus were characterized. These strains were selected as potential probiotics based on their oro-gastro-intestinal resistance, gut colonization, adhesion to Caco-2 cells, antimicrobial activities, antibiotic resistance, and safety aspects. Results of this study revealed that these isolates possessed high aggregation activities against pathogens in host intestines. Strain FB011 strain showed higher coaggregation and immunomodulatory activity in the gastro-intestinal tract than L. plantarum. These difference effects of Lactobacillus strains provide valuable information about using them to prevent Vibrio infections in the aquaculture industry.
