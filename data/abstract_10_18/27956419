The in vitro activities of fungal CYP51 inhibitors VT-1161 and VT-1129 were determined for Candida glabrata (n = 34) and C. krusei (n = 50). C. glabrata isolates were screened for FKS gene mutations. All isolates were resistant clinically and/or in vitro to at least one standard antifungal compound. VT-1161 and VT-1129 MICs for all isolates were at least 5-fold below achievable human plasma levels for VT-1161. VT-1161 and VT-1129 are promising for the treatment of resistant C. glabrata and C. krusei infections.
