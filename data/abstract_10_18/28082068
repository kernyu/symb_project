Inhibition of hepatitis B virus (HBV) capsid assembly is a novel strategy for the development of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) therapeutics. Herein we described our lead optimization studies including the synthesis, molecular docking studies and structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies of a series of novel heteroaryldihydropyrimidine (HAP) inhibitors of HBV capsid assembly inhibitors, and the discovery of a potent inhibitor of HBV capsid assembly of GLS4 (ethyl 4-[2-bromo-4-fluorophenyl]-6-[morpholino-methyl]-2-[2-thiazolyl]-1,4-dihydro-pyri midine-5-carboxylate) which is now in clinical phase 2. GLS4 demonstrated potent inhibitory activities in HBV HepG2.2.15 cell assay with an EC50 value of 1nM, and it also exhibited high potency against various drug-resistant HBV viral strains with EC50 values in the range of 10-20nM, more potent than the typical HBV polymerase inhibitors such as lamivudine, telbivudine, and entecavir. Pharmacokinetic profiles of GLS4 were favorable and safety evaluation including acute toxicity and repeated toxicity study indicated that GLS4 was safe enough to support clinical experiments in human.
