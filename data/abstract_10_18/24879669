OBJECTIVES: To review cases of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacillus urinary tract infections (UTIs) treated with tigecycline and the literature related to this subject. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the literature identifying patients with MDR Gram-negative bacillus UTIs treated with tigecycline. RESULTS: Fourteen cases describing treatment of UTIs caused by MDR Gram-negative bacilli with tigecycline are reviewed. Favourable clinical outcomes were noted in 11 of 14 cases. An initial favourable microbiological outcome was noted in 12 cases. Post-treatment cultures in two cases were positive for tigecycline-resistant organisms. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical efficacy of tigecycline for treatment of UTIs has not been extensively evaluated. Based on the available literature, tigecycline appears to have efficacy in some patients with MDR Gram-negative bacillus UTIs. Further research in this area is needed to fully elucidate the role of tigecycline in treating such patients.
