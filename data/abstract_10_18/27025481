As a result of comparative analysis of complete genomes as well as cell and vesicular proteomes of A. laidlawii strains differing in sensitivity to ciprofloxacin, it was first shown that the mycoplasma resistance to the antibiotic is associated with the reorganization of genomic and proteomic profiles, which concerns many genes and proteins involved in fundamental cellular processes and realization of bacterial virulence.
