Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli isolated from poultry in Brazil showed blaCTX-M-8 gene. IS10 was found upstream of blaCTX-M-8, harbored on plasmids IncI1, ST113/ST114 subtypes. Genomic relationship revealed a heterogeneous E. coli population. The gene blaCTX-M-8 is established in South America in food-producing animals, which represent risk of dissemination for other countries.
