The ever-expanding role of extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL)-harboring and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in causing serious infections poses a grave public health threat because these organisms also tend to be multidrug resistant, for which very few (if any) antibiotic options remain available. Rapid detection of such panresistant organisms offers one of the best solutions to improve patient screening and hospital infection control practices as well as curb inappropriate antibiotic use. This review discusses and compares primarily the current state-of-the-art culture-based and molecular methods that are commercially available for detection or screening of ESBL-harboring and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae.
