We sequenced pncA and rpsA genes plus flanking regions of 161 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates and found 10 new pncA and 3 novel rpsA mutations in pyrazinamide-resistant strains determined by the Bactec MGIT 960 system. The 3' end of rpsA might be added as the target of molecular detection of pyrazinamide susceptibility.
