OBJECTIVES: Berberis aristata is known to contain a variety of phenolic compounds contributing to its holistic capability of mitigating bacterial multidrug resistance. METHODS: B. aristata stem bark extract was prepared and was characterised using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The antimicrobial efficacy of the extract against carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli was assessed in vivo in an animal model using Sprague Dawley rats. Microbial counts in blood and urine, physical health status, haematological and biochemical analysis of blood, and histopathology of the kidney were assessed as the study endpoints. RESULTS: An aquo-alcoholic extract of B. aristata (PTRC-2111-A) was found to effectively manage peritonitis induced by carbapenem-resistant E. coli in a rat model at a single post-exposure prophylactic dose of 0.5mg/kg body weight (BW). The extract was also found to show a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) up to a dose of 2000mg/kg BW. Physical, immunological, haematological, biochemical and histopathological aberrations were found to be restored to normal in the herbal-treated group at a dose of 0.5mg/kg BW. CONCLUSIONS: The antimicrobial and hepatorenal protective ability of PTRC-2111-A could be attributed to the presence of isoquinoline alkaloids.
