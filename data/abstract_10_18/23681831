Early neonatal meningitis with non-fermenting Gram negative bacilli (NFGNB) is rare, and whenever it occurrs, inanimate environment is usually implicated as the source. The authors report a case of neonatal meningitis and sepsis with Chryseobacterium indologenes, a rare non fermenting Gram negative bacterium with unusual antimicrobial susceptibility. Despite resistance to all the beta lactams, carbapenems and aminoglycosides, therapy with ciprofloxacin led to a favorable outcome.
