Synthesis and large-scale manufacturing technologies are now available for the commercial production of even the most complex peptide anti-infectives. Married with the potential of this class of molecule as the next generation of effective, resistance-free and safe antimicrobials, and a much better understanding of their biology, pharmacology and pharmacodynamics, the first regulatory approvals and introduction into clinical practice of these promising drug candidates will likely be soon. This is a key juncture in the history/life cycle of peptide anti-infectives and, perhaps, their commercial and therapeutic potential is about to be realized. This review highlights the promise of these agents as the next generation of therapeutics and summarizes the challenges faced in, and lessons learned from, the past.
