The polymorphism G2576T in the 23S rRNA gene is the mutation most frequently associated with linezolid resistance in Enterococcus spp. isolates. We designed a high-resolution melting procedure to detect G2576T which succeeded in identifying linezolid resistant isolates and classified them according to the number of 23S rRNA copies mutated.
