We report on fosfomycin susceptibility and mechanisms of resistance in clinical strains of blaKPC-positive Enterobacter sp. (n = 19). A total of 14 strains (74%) were susceptible to fosfomycin; 8 strains (42%) were positive for fosA and no strains were positive for FosA3 or FosC2. FosA presence does not appear to correlate with susceptibility.
