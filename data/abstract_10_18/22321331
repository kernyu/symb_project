OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression levels of the type I IFN system in muscle and lung of experimental autoimmune myositis (EAM) model and to evaluate whether the type I IFN system associates with the pathogenesis of the EAM model in rats. METHODS: The EAM model was established to determine creatine kinase (CK) in blood serum. The pathology of muscle and lung tissue was examined by hematoxylin-eosin staining. The concentration of type I IFN system mRNA in muscle and lung tissue was detected by real-time PCR. RESULTS: The concentration of CK in model group [(209.17 +/- 91.95) IU/L] was significantly higher than that of two control groups (P < 0.05). The scores of muscle and lung in EAM model were significantly higher than that of control groups (all P < 0.05). The expression levels of the type I IFN system in muscle of EAM model were significantly higher than that of control groups (all P < 0.05). The expression levels of the type I IFN system in muscle with EAM model were positively correlated with CK and the scores of muscle (all P < 0.05). The expression levels of IFNalpha, IFNbeta, IFNalphaR1, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), myxovirus resistance protein 1 (MX1) in lung of EAM model were significantly higher than those of control groups (P < 0.05), but not seen in INF-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1) and IFN-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15). The expression levels of IFNalpha, IFNbeta, IFNalphaR1, STAT1 and MX1 in lung with EAM model were positively correlated with the scores of lung pathology (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The type I IFN system probably played a crucial role in the pathogenesis and the pathology of muscle and lung of EAM model.
