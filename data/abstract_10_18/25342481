Mechanisms of interaction between ciprofloxacin-based radiopharmaceutical labeled with technetium-99m and cultured Staphylococcus aureus were studied. The substance, reagent for radiopharmaceutical, and the radiopharmaceutical demonstrated similar bactericidal activity against the test bacterial cultures, which confirmed specific antibacterial activity of technetium-99m-labeled ciprofloxacin. The technetium-99m-labeled antibiotic reversibly interacts with inactivated Staphylococcus aureus culture, which indicates the existence of an additional non-specific pathway for radiopharmaceutical accumulation in the bacterial inflammation focus. Our experiment ruled out the possibility of binding free technetium-99m at concentrations <5% (its concentration in the radiopharmaceutical) with Staphylococcus aureus.
