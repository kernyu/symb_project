Four new beilschmiedic acid derivatives, cryptobeilic acids A-D (1-4), and tsangibeilin B (5) have been isolated from the bark of Beilschmiedia cryptocaryoides collected from Madagascar. Their structures were elucidated using detailed spectroscopic and spectrometric methods. Cryptobeilic acid A (1) and tsangibeilin B (5) structures were confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Compounds 1-5 displayed moderate antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli 6r3, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus DSM 586, and Pseudonamas stutzeri A1501, with the minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 10 to 50 muM, respectively. In addition, the compounds exhibited antiplasmodial activity against erythrocytic stages of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum strain NF54 and weak cytotoxicity against L6 cell lines.
