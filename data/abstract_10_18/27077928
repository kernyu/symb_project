The prevalence of various Ambler class A to D beta-lactamases, ISAba1, and class 1 and 2 integrons as well as the clonal relatedness in 105 Acinetobacter spp. isolates found in northeastern China was investigated. All 105 Acinetobacter spp. isolates were determined to be multidrug resistant (MDR), and the resistance rates to carbapenem agents were approximately 50%. PER, IMP, AmpC, and OXA-23 were found to be dominant beta-lactamases belonging to different classes, respectively. This is the first report of the coexistence of blaPER, blaIMP, blaAmpC, and blaOXA-23-like genes in Acinetobacter spp. isolates from northeastern China. ISAba1 was found upstream of the blaOXA-23-like gene in 87.8% (36/41) strains and upstream of the blaOXA-51-like gene in 26.5% (13/49) strains. ISAba3-like element was found upstream of the blaOXA-58-like gene in one blaOXA-58-like-positive strain. The presence of IntI1 was detected in 63.8% (67/105) of the isolates and the most prevalent gene cassettes were aacA4, aadA1, and catB8. The highly prevalent isolates belong to international clonal lineage (ICL)-II. These results indicate that the wide horizontal and clonal spread of MDR Acinetobacter spp. isolates harbouring multiple beta-lactamase genes has become a serious problem in northeastern China.
