We evaluated the incidence and risk factors of resistant Escherichia coli infections after the prostate biopsy under flouroquinolone prophylaxis. From January 2003 to December 2012, we retrospectively evaluated the records of 2215 patients. The risk factors were described for infective complications and resistant E. coli in positive cultures was calculated. Of 2215 patients, 153 had positive urine cultures, such as 129 (84.3%) E. coli, 8 (5.2%) Enterococcus spp., 6 (3.9%) Enterobacter spp., 5 (3.2%) Pseudomonas spp., 3 (1.9%) MRCNS, and 2 (1.3%) Klebsiella spp. Of the positive urine cultures which yielded E. coli, 99 (76.7%) were evaluated for fluoroquinolone resistance. Of those, 83 (83.8%) were fluoroquinolone-resistant and composed of 51 (61.4%) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-positive. Fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli ratios were 73.4 and 95.9% before 2008 and after 2008, respectively (P = 0.002). The most sensitive antibiotics for fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli strains were imipenem (100%), amikacin (84%) and cefoperazone (83%). The use of quinolones in the last 6 months and a history of hospitalization in the last 30 days were found to be significant risk factors. We found that resistant E. coli strains might be a common microorganism in patients with this kind of complication. The risk factors for development of infection with these resistant strains were history of the use of fluoroquinolones and hospitalization.
