In this study, a series of novel 3-(substituted phenyl)-6,7-dimethoxy-3a,4-dihydro-3H-indeno[1,2-c]isoxazole analogues were synthesized and evaluated for antimycobacterial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) H(37)Rv and isoniazid resistant M. tuberculosis (INHR-MTB). All the newly synthesized compounds were showing moderate to high inhibitory activities. The compound 6,7-dimethoxy-3-(4-chloro phenyl)-4H-indeno[1,2-c]isoxazole (4b) was found to be the most promising compound, active against MTB H(37)Rv and INHR-MTB with minimum inhibitory concentrations of 0.22 and 0.34 muM.
