One hundred Mycoplasma pneumoniae strains were isolated from pediatric patients from March 2008 to July 2009. Of 100 isolates, 90 (90%) were resistant to erythromycin (MICs >128 microg/mL for 88 strains and 64 microg/mL for 2 strains), azithromycin, and clarithromycin. Fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines maintain good activities against clinical M. pneumoniae isolates. Of 90 macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae strains, 88 (98%) harbored an A-to-G transition mutation at position 2063 in 23S rRNA genes, and the remaining 2 showed either A2064G or A2063T mutation; the latter point mutation is newly discovered and reported. Ninety-three (93%) clinical isolates were classified into the P1 gene restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) type I, and 7 (7%) were type II.
