Carbofuran is a systemic insecticide/nematicide extensively employed in modern agriculture and public health to combat various insect pests and vectors. The development of insecticide resistance due to natural selection pressure by Anopheline and Culicine mosquitoes has created serious repercussions in mosquito control and disease eradication campaigns. In this regard Culex quinquefasciatus, a widely dispersed domestic mosquito and the only vector of lymphatic filariasis in India, was selected for the present experiment. In order to assess the resistance development in this species, it was subjected to carbofuran bioassay by employing WHO method for 10 generations. The results of larval selection test up to F10 revealed a significant increase in tolerance development in every generation compared to the susceptible F1. The results revealed up to 16.225 times tolerance after 10 generations. The LC50 observed in F10 is 1.298 ppm compared to 0.08 ppm in the F1. The implications of the observations will be discussed.
