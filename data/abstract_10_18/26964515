OBJECTIVE: Escherichia coli is the microorganism responsible for most of the community-acquired urinary tract infections (UTI). Our purpose was to determine the susceptibility of E. coli associated with UTI in Galicia and consider the most appropriate antibiotics for empirical treatment. METHODS: Retrospective study during the period 2011- 2012 of the isolation of E. coli in urine samples from almost all the Galician population. Demographic variables, minimum inhibitory concentration, and reading data were collected: amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefotaxime, gentamicin, amikacin, ciprofloxacin, cotrimoxazole, nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin. The identification and susceptibility studies were mainly conducted by automated systems. The interpretation of the results was performed according to CLSI criteria. RESULTS: During the study period 55,046 E. coli were isolated in UTI. The percentages of resistance were: cotrimoxazole, 30%; ciprofloxacin, 33%; amoxicillin-clavulanate, 23% and 10% for 3rd generation cephalosporins. Fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin showed the highest activity with more than 96% of susceptibility in our study. The linear trend of resistance regarding age was statistically significant (p <0.0001) as it was regarding males (p <0.00001) for all antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: In Galicia, the most active antibiotics against E. coli associated with UTI are fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin so they should be considered as empirical treatment of choice by the community-acquired UTI not complicated by E. coli.
