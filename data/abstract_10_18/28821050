Focus of this research is on employment of a green route to prepare magnetic CuFe2O4@polysaccharide resin for environmental remediation purpose. The method is including solvent free solid state synthesis of copper ferrite nanoparticles by combustion route using cellulose as fuel. Then polysaccharide resin as well as its magnetic composite was prepared by using glucose, citric acid and copper ferrite as solid raw materials. Characterization study using FESEM and TEM images showed that as synthesized resin possesses graphene like structure as ferrite nanoparticles are dispersed in the matrice of resin. Methylene blue (MB) adsorption study of the nanohybrid showed that maximum removal efficiency obtained at pH=8 with very fast equilibrium time of 1min. Kinetic study confirmed pseudo - second order model is dominant kinetic model for dye removal. Moreover isotherm study revealed dye adsorption followed Freundlich model with maximum adsorption capacity of 366.6mgg(-1). Antibacterial activity of resin and magnetic composite was examined and result confirmed high efficiency of them in coping with E. coli as sample pathogen. Effect of solution pH, contact time and adsorbent dosage on E. coli capturing efficiency was also studied. Results showed bacteria capturing is more than 99% within equilibrium time of 20min and dosage of 20mg which confirmed high efficiency of the nanosystem in bacteria removing.
