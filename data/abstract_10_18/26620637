The current antibiotic crisis to treat infections by Acinetobacter baumannii is linked with the increase of antimicrobial resistance and the lack of development of new antimicrobial drugs. For this reason, new alternatives for the treatment and control of infections by A. baumannii are necessary. Several studies have reported the effect of adjuvants to restore the efficacy of existing antimicrobial agents. Herein, we analyzed the main results on the development of adjuvant drugs, as monotherapy or in combination therapy with existing antimicrobial agents, which have shown promising results in vitro and in vivo. However, caution is needed and further extensive in vivo studies have to be performed to confirm the potential use of these adjuvants as true therapeutic alternatives.
