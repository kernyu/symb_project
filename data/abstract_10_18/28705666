To evaluate the activity of ceftolozane/tazobactam compared with other broad-spectrum antimicrobials against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae, 497 non-duplicate P. aeruginosa and 802 Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates were consecutively collected during the period from September 2014 to April 2015 from patients in Germany with bloodstream, lower respiratory tract, intra-abdominal or urinary tract infections. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by broth microdilution. Results were interpreted according to EUCAST criteria. Ceftolozane/tazobactam showed good activity against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates with MIC50/90 values of 0.25/0.5 mg/L and 0.25/1 mg/L, respectively. Comparatively, piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime and meropenem MIC50/90 values were 2/8 mg/L, 0.25/8 mg/L and </=0.03/ </= 0.03 mg/L, respectively, for E. coli, and 2/16 mg/L, 0.12/8 mg/L, and </=0.03/ </= 0.03 mg/L, respectively, for K. pneumoniae isolates. The activity of ceftolozane/tazobactam against P. aeruginosa was superior to that of other antipseudomonal antimicrobials. Based on MIC50/90 values, ceftolozane/tazobactam (0.5/2 mg/L) was more active than piperacillin/tazobactam (8/64 mg/L), ceftazidime (2/16 mg/L), cefepime (2/16 mg/L) or meropenem (0.5/8 mg/L). In conclusion, ceftolozane/tazobactam exhibited the best in vitro potency of the antibiotics tested against P. aeruginosa, including isolates that were resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, ceftazidime, doripenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, amikacin, and tobramycin. Ceftolozane/tazobactam has the potential to become a useful addition to the limited armamentarium of drugs that can be used to treat this problem pathogen.
