Broad-host-range plasmid pRIO-5, harboring the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase bla(BES-1) gene in Serratia marcescens, was fully sequenced. Analysis of the 12,957-bp sequence of this IncP6-type plasmid revealed that the bla(BES-1) gene was associated with two copies of the insertion sequence IS26. The promoter responsible for the bla(BES-1) expression was hybrid, made of a -35 box located inside the inverted repeat of IS26 and a -10 box inside a remnant of an insertion sequence.
