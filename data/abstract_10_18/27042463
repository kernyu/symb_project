INTRODUCTION: Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus has emerged as an important pathogen in nosocomial and community acquired infections. Accurate and rapid identification of MRSA in clinical specimens is essential for timely decision of effective antimicrobial chemotherapy. AIM: The present study was conducted to compare efficacy of four conventional phenotypic methods, with mec- A based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for MRSA identification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methicillin resistance was determined in 200 S.aureus isolates by oxacillin disc diffusion, cefoxitin disc diffusion, Oxacillin Resistance Screening Agar and E-test. The results were compared with mec-A based PCR. RESULTS: Among 200 S.aureus isolates 62 (31%) were positive for mec-A gene by PCR. Cefoxitin disc diffusion, Oxacillin Resistance Screening Agar and E-test showed 100% specificity. Oxacillin disc diffusion had lowest sensitivity (82.5%) and specificity (98.5%) among all. The conventional methods take more time than PCR for diagnosing MRSA. Linezolid, Vancomycin & Dalfopristin were the highly sensitive drugs against MRSA isolates. CONCLUSION: Cefoxitin disc diffusion, is rapid, simple and cheaper, hence can be used routinely as an alternative to PCR for detection of MRSA in resource constraint laboratories.
