A range of amphiphilic sorbitan ethers has been synthesized in two steps from sorbitan following an acetalization/hydrogenolysis sequence. These sorbitan ethers and the acetal intermediates have been evaluated as antimicrobials against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. No antimicrobial activity was observed for Gram-negative bacteria. However, the compounds bearing a linear dodecyl chain exhibit antimicrobial activity (MIC as low as 8mug/mL) against Gram-positive bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. Encouraged by these preliminary results, dodecyl sorbitan was tested against a range of resistant strains and was found to be active against vancomycin-, methicillin- and daptomycin-resistant strains (MIC=32-64mug/mL).
