Neonatal sepsis due to carbapenem-resistant bacteria is difficult to treat due to limited therapeutic options. The detection of the new carbapenemase New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) from neonates has further complicated the situation (Roy et al., 2011a). The potent metallo-beta-lactamase NDM-1 efficiently hydrolyses all classes of beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems) and is also associated with multiple determinants that enable the bacteria to become resistant to other antibiotic classes (Nordmann et al., 2011). In the presence of NDM-1 other beta-lactamases may go unobserved because of the spectrum of activity of NDM-1 against all beta-lactam antibiotics. Thus, under the canopy of the NDM-1 these beta-lactamases also get the opportunity to spread. This communication reports association of two novel beta-lactamases, SHV-type beta-lactamase (SHV-167) and AmpC-type beta-lactamase (ACT-16), in two NDM-1-carrying Enterobacteriaceae isolated from the blood of two septicaemic neonates admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit.
