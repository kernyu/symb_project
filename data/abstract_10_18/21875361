A total of 70 Staphylococcus aureus isolates from postoperative infections in hospitalized horses were isolated between January 2005 and January 2011. Among them, 12 isolates were methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), 18 were borderline-oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (BORSA), and 40 were methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). During the same period, the equine clinic personnel were screened for nasal carriage of BORSA and MRSA. Genotyping revealed that BORSA ST1(MLST)-t2863(spa) isolates were responsible for most equine infections and were the main isolates found in colonized members of the personnel between 2005 and 2007, and that in 2007, MRSA ST398-t011-IVa(SCCmec) emerged in infection sites and personnel, replacing BORSA. Besides decreased susceptibility to oxacillin, all MRSA and BORSA of these two major clonal lineages displayed resistance to gentamicin and kanamycin conferred by the aac(6')-Ie-aph(2')-Ia gene and to trimethoprim conferred by dfr(K) in MRSA and dfr(A) in BORSA. All MRSA had additional resistance to tetracycline conferred by tet(M), whereas BORSA generally also display resistance to streptomycin conferred by str. The number of hospital-acquired MRSA infections in horses could be limited after the introduction of basic hygiene measures and personnel decolonization. Two MRSA carriers could not be decolonized using mupirocin, and a year after decolonization, additional members were recolonized with MRSA. Hygiene measures should, therefore, be maintained to limit the transmission of S. aureus between personnel and horses.
