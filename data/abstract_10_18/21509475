Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) carry many virulence factors, including those involved in long-term survival in the urinary tract. However, their prevalence and role among UPEC causing urinary tract infection (UTI) in children is not well studied. To further understand the virulence characteristics of these bacteria, we investigated the prevalence of antibiotic resistance, antigen 43 genes, curli and cellulose among UPEC in children from different countries. Isolates (n = 337) from five countries were tested for antibiotic susceptibility, phylogenetic groups, prevalence of flu, fluA(CFT073), fluB(CFT073), curli and cellulose. High prevalence of multidrug resistance and extended spectrum beta lactamase production was found among Iranian and Vietnamese isolates. Resistance was associated with phylogenetic group D while group B2 was associated with fluA(CFT073) and fluB(CFT073). Fewer Iranian isolates carried fluA(CFT073), curli and cellulose. fluB(CFT073) was most prevalent among Slovak isolates. Ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid resistance was prevalent among fluA(CFT073)- and fluB(CFT073)-positive Australian, Iranian and Swedish isolates. Lack of curli and cellulose was associated with resistance among Vietnamese isolates. We conclude that major differences exist in the prevalence of antibiotic resistance among UPEC from different countries. Associations observed between resistance and virulence factors may, in different ways, promote the long-term survival of UPEC in the urinary tract.
