This study was conducted to determine the prevalence rate, enterotoxigenecity, and antimicrobial resistance of S. aureus isolated from dairy products in Iran. From September 2010 to July 2011, a total of 347 samples from various dairy products, traditional and commercial, were collected from randomly selected retail stores. Overall, 20 samples (5.8%) were found to be contaminated with S. aureus. The highest prevalence of S. aureus was found in traditional cheese (11.1%), followed by traditional ice-cream (5.9%), cream (5.6%), and butter (5.3%). The ability to synthesize classical staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEA-E) was determined in 7 of 20 (35%) isolates by using ELISA. SE type C was the most common enterotoxin found in the isolated S. aureus (42.9%), followed by SE type A (28.6%), SEA+SEC and SE type D (14.3%). Of the 20 isolates, 16 (80.0%) were positive for one or more entrotoxin genes and 8 different genotypes were observed. Susceptibilities of the isolates were determined for 14 antimicrobial drugs using the disk diffusion assay. Most of the isolates (95.0%) were resistant to one or more two antimicrobial agent and 45.0% of the isolates were resistant to three or more of drugs. Resistance to ampicillin was the most common finding (55.0%), followed by tetracycline (40.0%) and penicillin G (30.0%). The results of this study showed the wide spread of enterotoxigenic and multidrug-resistant S. aureus strains in traditional dairy products in Iran and highlighted their public health hazards.
