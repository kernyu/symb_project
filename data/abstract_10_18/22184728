Specific mutations in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) fusion protein can cause palivizumab resistance. We assessed the incidence of sequence polymorphisms and palivizumab resistance in clinical RSV isolates collected from immunoprophylaxis-naive subjects. Polymorphisms were identified at low frequency, and only polymorphic mutations in antigenic site A (<1% of all polymorphisms) conferred palivizumab resistance.
