Background: Most frequently, empirical antibiotic therapy is immediately administered for patients with febrile neutropenia (FN). In this study, its aim was to assess the antibiotic resistance status and the cost of antibacterial agents in FN patients associated with hematological malignancies. Methods: The cost of antibacterial agents used in FN episodes in patients with hematologic neoplasms followed-up at the Department of Hematology from November 2010 to November 2012 were analyzed retrospectively. Results: In the study period, 15 of 141 patients who were admitted to the hematology ward and ineligible for the study criteria were excluded. In total, 282 febrile episodes of 126 consecutive patients with neutropenia were retrospectively investigated. Imipenem was found to be the most commonly used among the antibacterial drugs as 1.16 patient daily dose (PDD)/100 patient-days, 117.16 is the mean defined daily dose (DDD) per month and US $73264.66 total cost per year, followed by meropenem, cefoperazone-sulbactam, and linezolid. Conclusion: Choosing noncarbapenem-based antibacterial therapy for empirical treatment of FN until the growth of microorganisms and switching to carbapenem therapy subsequent to new radiological, or microbiological, or/ and clinical findings, the appropriate vancomycin use may decrease the cost of antibacterial agents in the treatment of FN episodes in patients with hematologic malignancies contributing to antimicrobial stewardship.
