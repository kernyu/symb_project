Protease inhibitors (PIs) targeting the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 protease, such as telaprevir, have significantly improved the sustained virologic response (SVR) rates of HCV genotype 1 antiviral therapy. Given the expanding antiviral therapy regimen, fast HCV PI resistance assays are urgently needed. In this view, we have developed a novel phenotypic resistance test for HCV PIs based on in vitro synthesis of patient-derived HCV NS3 protease and subsequent enzymatic testing in a fluorescent readout. The enzymatically active HCV NS3 proteases were synthesized from PCR-derived templates by an Escherichia coli S30 extract system. Tests of the protease genes with known mutations for telaprevir resistance showed that the phenotypic resistance test was fast, with a total turnaround time of <10 h, and was fully in agreement with the previous resistance results. The initial tests with 38 treatment-naive serum samples showed that the method was significantly less laborious and faster than currently available phenotypic resistance assays of HCV NS3 PIs.
