Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the causative agent of the sexually transmitted disease gonorrhoeae, possesses several mobile genetic elements (MGEs). The MGEs such as transposable elements mediate intrachromosomal rearrangements, while plasmids and the gonococcal genetic island are involved in interchromosomal gene transfer. Additionally, gonococcal MGEs serve as hotspots for recombination and integration of other genetic elements such as bacteriophages, contribute to gene regulation or spread genes through gonococcal populations by horizontal gene transfer. In this review, we summarise the literature on the structure and biology of MGEs and discuss how these genetic elements may play a role in the pathogenesis and spread of antimicrobial resistance in N. gonorrhoeae. Although an abundance of information about gonococcal MGEs exists (mainly from whole genome sequencing and bioinformatic analysis), there are still many open questions on how MGEs influence the biology of N. gonorrhoeae.
