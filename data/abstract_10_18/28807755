We hypothesized that cases of uncomplicated cystitis treated in a Urology Department would display higher antimicrobial susceptibility than those reported by the hospital antibiogram. This would suggest narrow spectrum antibiotics could still be an effective treatment for uncomplicated cystitis despite this era of antimicrobial resistance. The objective of this study was thus to evaluate the rates of antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates cultured from uncomplicated cystitis cases that presented to the Urology Department of a community hospital in Japan. We evaluated the efficacy of cefaclor, a narrow spectrum antibiotic, for uncomplicated cystitis. We further compared the rates of antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates from uncomplicated cystitis cases to those reported in a hospital-wide antibiogram. A retrospective chart review was performed of patients diagnosed with uncomplicated cystitis in the Urology Department. The patients were mainly treated orally by cefaclor at 750 mg/day for seven days. Significantly greater susceptibilities to cefazolin (87.0% vs 65.7%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (89.4% vs 79.1%) and levofloxacin (84.6% vs 66.9%) were observed in a cystitis antibiogram for Escherichia coli compared with a hospital-wide antibiogram. The clinical efficacy of cefaclor for acute cystitis was also demonstrated. The greater susceptibility of Escherichia coli to antimicrobials observed in this study supports the hypothesis that antimicrobial susceptibility rates in uncomplicated cystitis cases that present to the Urology Department would be greater than those reported in the hospital antibiogram. Therefore, uncomplicated acute cystitis can be treated by narrow spectrum antibiotics such as cefaclor even in this ''antimicrobial resistance era''.
