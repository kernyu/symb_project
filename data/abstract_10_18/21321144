Using time-kill methodology, we investigated the interactions of fosfomycin with meropenem or colistin or gentamicin against 17 genetically distinct Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates carrying blaKPC-2. Synergy was observed with meropenem or colistin against 64.7 and 11.8% of tested isolates, while the combination with gentamicin resulted in indifference. All studied combinations showed improved bactericidal activity, compared to fosfomycin alone and prevented the development of fosfomycin resistance in 69.2, 53.8, and 81.8% of susceptible isolates, respectively.
