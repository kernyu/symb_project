Structure analysis was performed on the antibiotic-resistance-gene region of conjugative plasmids of four fish farm bacteria.The kanamycin resistance gene, IS26, and tetracycline resistance gene (tetA(D)) were flanked by two IS26s in opposite orientation in Citrobacter sp. TA3 and TA6, and Alteromonas sp. TA55 from fish farm A. IS26-Inner was disrupted with ISRSB101. The chloramphenicol resistance gene, IS26 and tetA (D) were flanked by two IS26s in direct orientation in Salmonella sp. TC67 from farm C. Structures of tetA (D) and IS26 were identical among the four bacteria, but there was no insertion within the IS26-Inner of Salmonella sp. TC67. Horizontal gene transfer between the strains of two different genera in fish farm A was suggested by the structure homologies of mobile genetic elements and antibiotic resistance genes.
