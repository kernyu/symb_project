Inclusion of the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV10) in the Chilean infant vaccination Program in 2011 was followed by a reduction of hospital admissions and pneumonia-related deaths in this age group. However, a progressive increase of serotype 19A pneumococcal isolates (not included in PCV10) has been observed. According to the analysis of pneumococcal strains performed by the national reference laboratory of the Institute of Public Health as part of a national surveillance on invasive pneumococcal infections, the relative proportion of serotype 19A isolates increased from <5% before 2010 to 12-23% in years 2014-2015. Serotype 19A represented 4-8% of the isolates in the pre-vaccine era among children less than 2 years, increasing to 25% during 2014. This increase has been documented in two-thirds of the national territory. Aimong children <5 years of age, 25% of 19A serotype isolates from non-meningeal infections were penicillin resistant wheras from meningeal infections near 100% were penicillin resistant. Genetic analysis indicates that 48% of these 19A strains belong to clonal complex 320, recognized for its pandemic potential and high antimicrobial resistance. Among children, most invasive infections secondary to serotype 19A have occurred in patients fully vaccinated with PCV10. These epidemiological changes indicate an increase in invasive pneumococcal infections by serotype 19A in Chile and the need to control this problem by changing the current PCV10 for the PCV13 vaccine containing serotype 19A.
