As an extreme and unique environment, microgravity has significant effects on microbial cellular processes, such as cell growth, gene expression, natural pathways and biotechnological products. Application of microgravity effects to identify the regulatory elements in reengineering microbial hosts will draw much more attention in further research. In this commentary, we discuss the microgravity effects in engineered microorganisms for improving metabolic conversion, including cell growth kinetics, antimicrobial susceptibility, resistance to stresses, secondary metabolites production, recombinant protein production and enzyme activity, as well as gene expression changes. Application of microgravity effects in engineered microorganisms could provide valuable platform for innovative approaches in bioprocessing technology to largely improve the metabolic conversion efficacy of biopharmaceutical products.
