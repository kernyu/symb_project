The multiresistance gene cfr was identified for the first time in an Enterococcus faecalis isolate of animal origin. The 32,388-bp plasmid pEF-01, which carried the cfr gene, was sequenced completely. Three copies of the insertion sequence IS1216 were identified in pEF-01, and the detection of a cfr- and IS1216-containing amplicon by inverse PCR suggests that IS1216 may play a role in the dissemination of cfr by a recombination process.
