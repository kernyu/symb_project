Enterococci, no more regarded as GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) organism, are emerging as an important source of nosocomial infections worldwide. The main contributors in pathogenesis of enterococci are the presence of various virulent factors and antibiotic resistance genes. We aimed to examine the prevalence, dissemination, antibiotic resistance and virulent factors associated with enterococci from bulk soil (BS). A total of 372 enterococci were isolated from 500 soil samples. PCR was used to identify the isolates up to species level and for carriage of 16 virulence genes including hospital associated marker (i.e. IS16). E. faecium (77%), E. faecalis (10%), E. hirae (4%) and E. casseliflavus (1%) were the major species isolated. The efaAfs was the most dominant gene (100%), followed by gelE (78.9%), sprE (76.3%) and esp (13%) in E. faecalis isolates. The E. faecium carried largely efaAfm (86.8%) and acm (50.3%) genes. Presence of entP (10%), entA (8.3%) and entB (6.9%) genes was detected mostly in E. faecium, while enlA (18%) and ef1097 (2.6%) was only detected in E. faecalis isolates. 50% E. faecalis and 2% E. faecium isolates harbored IS16, while five E. faecalis harbored both IS16 and espTIM genes providing strong evidence about the presence of espTIM gene on 64 Kb pathogenicity island. BOX and RAPD PCR analysis revealed high degree of genetic variation within the species. Degree of resistance against 12 major antibiotics showed chloramphenicol as the most effective and meropenom as the least effective antibiotic. Presence of multiple antibiotic resistant, virulent and hospital associated enterococci in bulk soil represents a potential source for further dissemination to humans and animals and poses potential impact on public health.
