AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of durancin 61A alone or in combination with nisin, pediocin PA-1, reuterin, microcin J25, vancomycin or tetracycline as an inhibitor of resistant clinical pathogens and to shed light on its mode of action. RESULTS: Durancin and reuterin were effective inhibitors of Clostridium difficile, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The combination of durancin and reuterin was highly synergistic against C. difficile (fractional inhibitory concentration index = 0.2). Durancin/vancomycin combination was synergistic against S. aureus ATCC((R)) 700699 (fractional inhibitory concentration index = 0.3). Conclusion & future perspective: Durancin 61A alone or combined with other bacteriocins or antibiotics may therefore provide a possible therapeutic option for the treatment of infections by these pathogens.
