BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistant Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as one of the most problematic hospital acquired pathogens around the world. This study was designed to investigate the presence of antibiotic resistant A. baumannii in various hospital environments. METHODS: Air, water and inanimate surface samples were taken in different wards of four hospitals and analyzed for the presence of A. baumannii. Confirmed A. baumannii isolates were analyzed for antimicrobial susceptibility and also screened for the presence of three most common OXA- type carbapenemase-encoding genes. RESULTS: A. baumannii was detected in 11% (7/64) of air samples with the highest recovery in intensive care units (ICUs). A. baumannii was also detected in 17% (7/42) and 2% (1/42) of surface and water samples, respectively. A total of 40 A. baumannii isolates were recovered and analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility showed the highest resistance towards ceftazidime (92.5%, 37/40). 85% (34/40) and 80% (32/40) of the isolates were also resistant to imipenem and gentamicin, respectively. Resistance genes analysis showed that 77.5% (31/40) strains contained OXA-23 and 5% (2/40) strains contained OXA-24, but OXA-58 was not detected in any of the strains. CONCLUSION: Detection of antibiotic resistant A. baumannii in various samples revealed that hospital environments could act as a potential source for transmission of A. baumannii infections especially in ICUs. These results emphasize the importance of early detection and implementation of control measures to prevent the spread of A. baumannii in hospital environments.
