Multiple factors including tumor heterogeneity and intrinsic or acquired resistance have been associated with drug resistance in lung cancer. Increased stemness and the plasticity of cancer cells have been identified as important mechanisms of resistance; therefore, treatments targeting cancer cells independent of stemness phenotype would be much more effective in treating lung cancer. In this article, we have characterized the anticancer effects of the antibiotic Nigericin in cells displaying varying degrees of stemness and resistance to anticancer drugs, arising from (1) routine culture conditions, (2) prolonged periods of serum starvation. These cells are highly resistant to conventional anticancer drugs such as Paclitaxel, Hydroxyurea, Colchicine, Obatoclax, Wortmannin, and LY294002, and the multidrug-resistant phenotype of cells growing under prolonged periods of serum starvation is likely the result of extensive rewiring of signaling pathways, and (3) lung tumorspheres that are enriched for cancer stem-like cells. We found that Nigericin potently inhibited the viability of cells growing under routine culture conditions, prolonged periods of serum starvation, and lung tumorspheres. In addition, we found that Nigericin downregulated the expression of key proteins in the Wnt canonical signaling pathway such as LRP6, Wnt5a/b, and beta-catenin, but promotes beta-catenin translocation into the nucleus. The antitumor effects of Nigericin were potentiated by the Wnt activator HLY78 and by therapeutic levels of the US Food and Drug Administration-approved drug Digitoxin and its novel synthetic analog MonoD. We believe that Nigericin may be used in a co-therapy model in combination with other novel chemotherapeutic agents in order to achieve potent inhibition of cancers that display varying degrees of stemness, potentially leading to sustained anticancer effects.
