OBJECTIVES: Acute rejection in renal transplant is considered a risk factor for short-term and long-term allograft survival. The expected reversal rate for the first acute cellular rejection, by steroid pulse, ranges between 60% and 100%, and lack of improvement within 1 week of treatment is defined as steroid-resistant rejection. This work sought to evaluate factors that lead to steroid-resistant acute cellular rejection among patients with first live-donor renal allotransplant and its effect on graft and patient survival. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with an improvement in serum creatinine levels were considered controls (group 1; n=100); while the others were considered an early steroid-resistant group (group 2; n=99). Both groups were matched demographically. RESULTS: Patients with a target cyclosporine level below accepted therapeutic levels were significantly higher in group 2 (P = .02). We found no significant differences between the groups regarding posttransplant complications (P > .05). Mean hospital stay was longer in group 2 (P = .021). Living patients with functioning graft were more prevalent in group 1, while those alive on dialysis were more prevalent in group 2. The groups were comparable regarding long-term patient and graft survival despite significantly lower creatinine values in patients of group 1 at 6 months' follow-up (P </= .001). CONCLUSIONS: Prebiopsy low cyclosporine trough levels and associated chronic changes among patients who were maintained on calcineurin inhibitor-based regimens represented the most-important risk factors for the early steroid-resistant group. Rescue therapies improve short-term graft outcome; however, they did not affect either patient or long-term graft survival after 5 years' follow-up.
