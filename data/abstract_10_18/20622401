Posaconazole is a novel second-generation Triazole oral antifungal agent. It is highly effective in the prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections in immunocompromised patients. It is used as a first-line agent as well as for salvage therapy in invasive fungal infections including aspergillosis, oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis. It has a good adverse effect profile. With the rising incidence of invasive fungal infections due to the HIV pandemic and medical advancements in transplantation and cancer therapy, these features make posaconazole a valuable addition in the family of antifungal agents.
