Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a significant cause of morbidity, mortality and graft loss in solid organ transplantation (SOT). Treatment options for ganciclovir-resistant CMV are limited. We describe a case of ganciclovir-resistant CMV disease in a renal transplant recipient manifested by thrombotic microangiopathy-associated glomerulopathy. Adoptive T cell immunotherapy using CMV-specific T cells from a donor bank was used as salvage therapy. This report is a proof-of-concept of the clinical and logistical feasibility of this therapy in SOT recipients.
