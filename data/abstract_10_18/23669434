In this report, a case of community-acquired acute bacterial meningitis (CA-ABM) caused by CTX-M-15-producing Escherichia coli in an elderly male patient was presented in the light of literature. Cultures of cerebrospinal fluid, blood, ear discharge, and stool samples yielded CTX-M-15-producing E. coli in-vitro, which was resistant to the extended-spectrum cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin and susceptible to imipenem, meropenem and amikacin. Meningitis was treated with parenteral meropenem plus parenteral and intraventricular amikacin administration. Since bacterial meningitis is a life-threatening infection, empiric antibiotic therapy with carbapenem can be started before the culture results are obtained, mainly in areas where the ESBL epidemiology is well known.
