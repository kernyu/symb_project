INTRODUCTION: Acquired metallo-beta-lactamases (MbetaL) are emerging determinants of resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. The objectives of this study were to phenotypically detect MbetaL in imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii, to investigate the association between MbetaL-positive strains and hospitals, and to compare the resistance profiles of MbetaL-producing and non-MbetaL-producing strains. METHODS: The approximation disk and combined disk assay methods were used in this study. RESULTS: A total of 18 (38.3%) P. aeruginosa isolates and 1 (5.6%) A. baumannii isolate tested positive for the presence of MbetaL. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the need for strict surveillance and for the adoption of preventive measures to reduce the spread of infection and potential outbreaks of disease caused by MbetaL-producing microorganisms.
