The challenge posed by increasing levels of drug-resistant bacteria world-wide is manifest, and must be dealt with both by new approaches to the use of existing antibiotics and by the introduction of novel drugs. ACHN-490 is the first neoglycoside, or next-generation aminoglycoside, to begin clinical development. ACHN-490 was designed to target key pathogens, particularly gram-negative organisms and those resistant to older antibiotics. ACHN-490 demonstrates promising in vitro activity against wild-type and resistant bacteria while retaining the favorable bactericidal and synergistic properties of the aminoglycoside class. These attributes, along with the results of Phase 1 studies of ACHN-490 injection, suggest that ACHN-490 may help to fill the growing unmet need for new antibacterial agents.
