The clinical implication of extended-spectrum cephalosporin (ESC) resistance has been unclear in patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis (SPM). We collected the clinical data of 120 patients with SPM in 12 hospitals of the Republic of Korea. The clinical characteristics and outcomes of 23 ESC-nonsusceptible SPM episodes were compared to those of 97 ESC-susceptible episodes. Hospital acquisition, presence of other foci of pneumococcal infection, septic shock at initial presentation, or concomitant bacteremia were more commonly observed in ESC-nonsusceptible than ESC-susceptible SPM. Empiric antimicrobial therapy with vancomycin and ESC combination was very common in both groups. Although there was a tendency towards higher early fatality in ESC-nonsusceptible SPM (3-day mortality; 17.4 % vs. 4.4 %, p = 0.05), in-hospital mortality (26.1 % vs. 20.9 %, p = 0.59) and median length of hospital stay (20 days vs. 24 days, p = 0.34) did not differ between ESC-nonsusceptible and ESC-susceptible SPM.
