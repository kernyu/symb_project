We report a rare case in a female infant (age, 3.5 months) with primary immunodeficiency (IFN-gamma/IL-12 pathway defect) who presented with suppurative lymphadenitis after Mycobacterium bovis BCG vaccination. The strain of M. bovis BCG identified was found to be resistant to isoniazid and rifampin. The patient was treated with a special pharmacological regimen involving isoniazid (in a limited, strategic manner), ethambutol, streptomycin, and IFN-gamma, after which there was complete resolution of the lesions.
