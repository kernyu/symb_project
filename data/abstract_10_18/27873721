Infectious diseases of bacterial origin are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries such as Ethiopia. To minimise such burdens, proper use of antibiotics has played a vital role and saved countless lives. However, use of antimicrobials as therapeutic agents is compromised by the potential development of drug-resistant micro-organisms. Currently, antimicrobial drug resistance has become a public health concern both in developing and developed countries. Antimicrobial drug resistance is dramatically accelerated when antimicrobials are misused. This is critical, especially in developing countries where they are not only misused but are often underused due to financial constraints. Although large-scale studies on antimicrobial resistance in Ethiopia have not yet been conducted, the available reports indicate a trend towards increasing resistance rates among pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., Salmonella spp. and Staphylococcus aureus to commonly prescribed antibiotics, including ampicillin, amoxicillin, penicillin, tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. This review summarises the existing data on antibacterial drug resistance in this country.
