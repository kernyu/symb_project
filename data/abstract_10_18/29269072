Members of the Bacillaceae family, including Bacillus spp., Brevibacillus spp., Paenibacillus spp., Aneurinibacillus sp., and Halobacillus sp., are an important source of structurally diverse classes of short peptides of approximately 30 residues or fewer possessing peculiar and rapid killing activity against various pathogens. Additionally, many have unique structures that enhance resistance to hydrolysis by proteases, and these are ideal therapeutic tools and potential alternatives to current antibiotics. The need for novel antibiotic lead compounds is urgent, and this review summarises 119 Bacillaceae compounds published since 2000, including 12 surfactin-like lipopeptides, 16 iturinic lipopeptides, fengycin C, 33 other cyclic lipopeptides, 26 linear lipopeptides, two thiopeptides, four 2,5-diketopiperazines, 20 typical cyclic peptides, and five standard linear peptides. The current and potential therapeutic applications of these peptides, including structure, antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activities, are discussed.
