Sequential application of target drugs is standard procedure after renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients develop resistance. To optimize the sequence, antitumour effects of the mTOR inhibitor RAD001 or the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) sorafenib on RCC cells with acquired resistance to the TKI sunitinib was evaluated. RCC cells were exposed to 1 muM sunitinib for 24 hrs (as control) and for 8 weeks (to induce resistance) and then switched to RAD001 (5 nM) or sorafenib (5 muM) for a further 8 weeks. Tumour cell growth, cell cycle progression, cell cycle regulating proteins and intracellular signalling were then investigated. Short-term application of sunitinib (24 hrs) induced cell growth blockade with accumulation in the G2/M phase. RCC cells became resistant to sunitinib after 8 weeks, demonstrated by accelerated cell growth along with enhanced cdk1, cdk2, loss of p27, activation of Akt, Rictor and Raptor. Switching to sorafenib only slightly reduced growth of the sunitinib resistant RCC cells and molecular analysis indicated distinct cross-resistance. In contrast, full response was achieved when the cancer cells were treated with RAD001. p19 and p27 strongly increased, phosphorylated Akt, Rictor and Raptor decreased and the tumour cells accumulated in G0/G1. It is concluded that an mTOR-inhibitor for second-line therapy could be the strategy of choice after first-line sunitinib failure.
