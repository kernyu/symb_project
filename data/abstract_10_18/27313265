Resistance to the novel beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination ceftazidime-avibactam (CAZ-AVI) among carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) has infrequently been reported in the United States. We report unexpectedly high rates of resistance to CAZ-AVI in CRE bloodstream isolates at our institution associated with the nonoutbreak spread of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase in diverse Enterobacteriaceae species.
