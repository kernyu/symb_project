Although tuberculosis treatment is dependent on drug-susceptibility testing (DST) and molecular drug-resistance detection, treatment failure and relapse remain a challenge. This could be partially due to the emergence of antibiotic-tolerant dormant mycobacteria, where host lipids have been shown to play an important role. This study evaluated the susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to two antibiotic combinations - rifampicin, moxifloxacin, amikacin and metronidazole (RIF-MXF-AMK-MTZ), and rifampicin, moxifloxacin, amikacin and pretomanid (RIF-MXF-AMK-PA) - in a lipid-rich dormancy model. Although their effectiveness in in vitro cultures with dextrose as a carbon source has been proved, we observed that none of the antibiotic mixtures were bactericidal in the presence of lipids. The presence of lipids may confer tolerance to M. tuberculosis against the mixture of antibiotics tested and such tolerance could be even higher during the dormant stages. The implementation of lipids in DST on clinical isolates could potentially lead to a better treatment strategy.
