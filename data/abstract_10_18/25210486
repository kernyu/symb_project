Urinary Tract Infections (UTI) are a common cause of childhood febrile illness with 7% of girls and 2% of boys having a symptomatic culture positive UTI by the age of six years. Although there are conflicting views on the long term sequelae of UTI, as well as the place of prophylaxis, the universal aims of treatment of childhood UTI remain those of symptom alleviation, prevention of systemic infection and short and longer term complications. There is good evidence of historical and emerging resistance patterns, therefore rationalisation of prescription patterns by knowledge of sensitivities coupled with re-examination of empirical antibiotic choices is clearly important. Local formularies should reflect geographical resistance patterns along with best evidence on the duration and choice of antibiotic in order to maximize therapeutic effect, while minimizing the development of resistant strains.
