Type I interferon (IFN) exerts strong antiviral activity, particularly against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and although several viral proteins have been shown to deregulate IFN induction, little is known about the induction of type I IFNs by HIV RNAs. In the present study, we used the stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) method to determine the proteomic profile in U937 monocytic cells after transfection with viral RNA of HIV. We then used a western blot assay to validate the proteomic results. It was revealed by the SILAC method that there were 1624 non-redundant peptides with quantitative information and 281 proteins with quantitative information in the HIV-RNA-transfected U937 cells when compared to cells transfected with control RNA. In particular, 6, 8 or 12 hours post-transfection, HIV RNA transfection promoted the expression of such interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) as interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs), interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs), interferon-induced gene 15 protein (ISG15), myxovirus (influenza virus) resistance protein 1 (MX1), and interferon-induced guanylate-binding protein 1 (GBP1), and this was confirmed by western blot assay. In conclusion, HIV RNA is a strong stimulator of IFNs, promoting the expression of such ISGs as IFITs, IFITMs, ISG15, MX1 and GBP1.
