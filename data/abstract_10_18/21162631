Several studies have shown that the rates of resistant Gram-positive pathogens, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA), hetero-VISA, and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae have witnessed a substantial global increase. Ceftaroline fosamil is the prodrug form of ceftaroline, a new cephalosporin active against resistant Gram-positive pathogens and common Gram-negative organisms that do not produce extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases and do not express AmpC. Ceftaroline fosamil was found to be effective and well-tolerated for the treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia compared with standard therapy. The drug has recently been granted US FDA approval for both indications.
