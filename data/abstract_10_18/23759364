The use of beta-lactam antibiotics results in the selection of bacteria showing resistance toward this class of antibiotics. The review focuses on the increasing importance of methicillin resistant staphylococci and broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in horses. Diagnostic protocols that optimize accurate identification of these bacteria from both clinical samples and samples obtained from putative carrier animals are described. In addition, the opportunities and pitfalls for preventive and curative measures are discussed.
