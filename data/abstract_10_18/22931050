Recipients of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are highly susceptible to the development of infections with multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms. We describe the case of a patient with an LVAD who developed a device-related, daptomycin non-susceptible, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection, highlighting this patient population as highly vulnerable to the development of such antimicrobial resistance. This report includes a thorough review of the literature on the mechanisms of development of daptomycin non-susceptibility and suggests ways to prevent its emergence. We also provide and underscore the appropriate guidelines to abide by when attempting to control infections with such resistant isolates. This case also demonstrates the importance of definitive treatment with LVAD removal and transplantation as a component of appropriate management of invasive LVAD infections. In addition, we suggest that even infections with MDR organisms may not adversely affect post-transplant outcomes.
