We conducted a retrospective study of 2,149 clinicalSalmonellastrains to help document the historical emergence of antimicrobial resistance. There were significant increases in resistance to older drugs, including ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline, which were most common inSalmonella entericaserotype Typhimurium. An increase in multidrug resistance was observed for each decade since the 1950s. These data help show howSalmonellaevolved over the past 6 decades, after the introduction of new antimicrobial agents.
