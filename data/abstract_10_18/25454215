The resistance of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) to antibiotics is an increasing problem. Clindamycin has been used as empiric therapy for the rising incidence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). As such, the local rate of inducible resistance against clindamycin is an important consideration. This multicenter study was conducted to identify the incidence of inducible clindamycin resistance of S. aureus isolates in Tokyo, the most populous city in Japan. A total of 2408 adult and pediatric samples were collected from a university hospital and two pediatric hospitals between January 2011 and December 2011. Among the 2341 samples analyzed, the incidence of inducible clindamycin resistance in erythromycin-resistant and clindamycin-susceptible/intermediate isolates was found to be 91% (n = 585), a figure much higher compared to most reports from other countries. In conclusion, we found a very high rate of inducible clindamycin resistance in macrolide-resistant S. aureus isolates in our geographic area.
