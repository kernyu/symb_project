In order to provide effective treatment options for infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria, innovative antibiotics are necessary, preferably with novel modes of action and/or belonging to novel classes of drugs. Naturally occurring cyclic lipodepsipeptides, which contain one or more ester bonds along with the amide bonds, have emerged as promising candidates for the development of new antibiotics. Some of these natural products are either already marketed or in advanced stages of clinical development. However, despite the progress in the development of new antibacterial agents, it is inevitable that resistant strains of bacteria will emerge in response to the widespread use of a particular antibiotic and limit its lifetime. Therefore, development of new antibiotics remains our most efficient way to counteract bacterial resistance.
