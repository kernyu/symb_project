Emergence of artemisinin resistance has been confirmed in Cambodia and the border areas of Thailand, the well-known hotspots of multidrug resistance Plasmodium falciparum. It appears to be spreading to the western border of Thailand along the Thai-Myanmar border, and will probably spread to other endemic areas of the world in the near future. This raises a serious concern on the long-term efficacy of artemisinin-based combination therapies, as these combination therapies currently constitute the last effective and most tolerable treatment for multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum. Attempts have been made by a diverse array of stakeholders to prevent the emergence of new foci of artemisinin resistance, as well as to limit the spread of resistance to the original foci. The success in achieving this goal depends on effective integration of containment and surveillance programs with other malaria control measures, with support from both basic and operational research.
