The LPS-mediated lethality of NC/Nga mice, having fewer NKT cells, was examined by using d-galactosamine (d-GalN)-sensitization. The NC/Nga mice were not killed by a simultaneous administration of d-GalN and LPS whereas all C57BL/6 (B6) control mice were killed. The injection of d-GalN and LPS failed to elevate the levels of serum alanine aminotransferase and caspase 3 in the liver tissues of NC/Nga mice. Further, the nitric oxide (NO) level of the d-GalN- and LPS-injected NC/Nga mice was much lower than those of the B6 mice. The expression of an inducible NO synthase (iNOS) was significantly reduced in the livers of NC/Nga mice. However, there was no significant difference in LPS-induced TNF-alpha production between B6 mice and NC/Nga mice. The NC/Nga mice had an impaired expression of IFN-gamma protein and mRNA in response to d-GalN and LPS. The pretreatment with alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer), which activates Valpha14(+) NKT cells and induces the production of IFN-gamma, rendered NC/Nga mice more susceptible to the LPS-mediated lethality. The livers of NC/Nga mice had fewer NKT cells compared to B6 mice. Taken together, it is suggested that the resistance of NC/Nga mice to the LPS-mediated lethality with d-GalN sensitization depended on the impaired IFN-gamma production caused by fewer NKT cells and reduced NO production that followed.
