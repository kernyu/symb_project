The effectiveness of the World Health Organization's (WHO) treatment category II regimen for tuberculosis in 124 patients was compared to that of 1147 patients receiving treatment category I in Lima, Peru following WHO's guidelines. Drug susceptibility test was available for 85% of patients. Prevalence of multi drug resistance and streptomycin resistance were 5.1% and 20.7%, respectively. Overall cure rate for regimen II was lower than that of regimen I: 67.8% (95% CI: 58.9-75.6.) vs 77.8% (95% CI: 75.3-80.2), p=0.014. Multi-drug resistance exerted a profound effect on cure rates in both regimens. Our results support the phasing-out of treatment category II regimen in Peru.
