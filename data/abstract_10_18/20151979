The present study found that the pentapeptide mimic C-61, targeting the substrate binding P-site of SYK tyrosine kinase acted as a potent inducer of apoptosis in chemotherapy-resistant SYK-expressing primary leukemic B-cell precursors taken directly from relapsed B-precursor leukaemia (BPL) patients (but not SYK-deficient infant pro-B leukaemia cells), exhibited favourable pharmacokinetics in mice and non-human primates, and eradicated in vivo clonogenic leukaemia cells in severe combined immunodeficient mouse xenograft models of chemotherapy-resistant human BPL at dose levels non-toxic to mice and non-human primates. These in vitro and in vivo findings provide proof of principle for effective treatment of chemotherapy-resistant BPL by targeting SYK-dependent anti-apoptotic blast cell survival machinery with a SYK P-Site inhibitor. Further development of C-61 may provide the foundation for therapeutic innovation against chemotherapy-resistant BPL.
