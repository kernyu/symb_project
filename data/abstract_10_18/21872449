The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains has made it difficult to treat infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In order to develop new alternative therapies for the treatment of MDR P. aeruginosa infections, the antimicrobial activities of different antibiotic combinations have been studied in vitro and in vivo. In this study, the in vitro antimicrobial activities of six different combinations of polymyxins and beta-lactams against 34 clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa were evaluated. For the combinations tested by the checkerboard method, an indifferent effect was observed for all strains. However, 27 strains (19 MDR) showed reductions in their minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for at least one of the antibiotics in the combinations evaluated. Combination with polymyxins resulted in reductions of the beta-lactam MICs, with a change in the resistance category to susceptible in eight MDR strains. These results from the in vitro evaluation suggest that combinations of polymyxins and beta-lactams may significantly reduce the MICs of the antibiotics tested. These combinations require further evaluation for use in medical practice.
