BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the virulence profiles of Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical strains recently isolated from patients hospitalized for chronic leg ulcers in the Dermatology Department of Central Military Emergency University Hospital "Carol Davila", Bucharest, Romania. METHODS: The phenotypic screening evaluated eight soluble virulence factors (haemolysins, lecithinase, lipase, caseinase, gelatinase, amylase, DNase, aesculin hydrolysis), as well as adherence ability (Cravioto adapted method) and invasion capacity on HeLa cells (gentamicin protection assay). Seven virulence genes encoding for protease IV, 3 exoenzymes (exoS, exoT, exoU), two phospholipases plcH- haemolytic phospholipase C and plcN- non-haemolytic phospholipase C) and alginate were investigated by PCR. RESULTS: The pore forming toxins and enzymes were expressed in variable proportions, the majority of the tested strains producing beta haemolysin (92.3 %), lipase (76.9 %) and lecithinase (61.5 %). The most frequent virulence genes detected in the analyzed strains were the ExoT (100 %) and AlgD (92.3 %) genes, genes codifying for phospholipases (84.6 % each of them) and for protease IV (61.5 %). CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that correlating virulence profiles and infection clinical outcome is very useful for setting up efficient preventive and therapeutic procedures for hospitalized patients with chronic leg ulcers and positive P. aeruginosa cultures.
