BACKGROUND: Production of Beta-Lactamase enzymes, especially extended-spectrum Beta -Lactamases (ESBL), is a primary mechanism of resistance in these bacteria. The purpose of this study was detection of blaTEM, blaSHV, blaCTX-M, blaCTX-M-15, blaPER and blaVEB in K. pneumoniae, isolated from clinical specimens by the PCR method and antibiotic susceptibility patterns in these strains isolated, in Sanandaj city, Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During a period from October 2015 to July 2016, 52 K. pneumoniae isolates collected from general hospitals in the city of Sanandaj, Iran. After identifying the strains by biochemical testing, the disc diffusion method used for determining antimicrobial susceptibility and screening the ESBL-producing isolates. Detection of blaTEM, blaSHV, blaCTX-M, blaCTX-M-15, blaPER and blaVEB ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae carried out by PCR. RESULTS: Out of 52-collected K. pneumoniae, highest and lowest rates of resistance related to co-trimoxazole with 67.3 % and amikacin with 30.7 %. 55.7% identified as MDR and 69.23% were ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae. blaSHV was the most prevalent gene in ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae. blaTEM, blaCTX-M , blaCTX-M-15 producing K. pneumoniae strains showed higher rates of drug resistant compared with negative strains (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Results of this study showed that the prevalence rate of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates is increasing in MDR strains, which raises concerns regarding the treatment of K. pneumoniae. Therefore, molecular research in the field of antimicrobial resistance of bacteria is essential to prevent the spread of resistant strains.
