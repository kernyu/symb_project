The present study analyzes the characteristics of Salmonella spp. from broiler chicken farms in Brazil. In total, 82 Salmonella spp. strains were characterized by serotyping, determining susceptibility to antimicrobials, and using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Fifteen Salmonella serotypes were identified, among which Minnesota (40.24%), Infantis (14.63%), Heidelberg (7.31%), Senftenberg (6.09%), and Mbandaka (6.09%) were the most frequent. Salmonella Minnesota occurred mostly in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul and in one of the broiler companies surveyed. Approximately 60% of the strains were resistant to at least one of the antimicrobials tested. From these isolates, 17.07% were resistant to only one antimicrobial (tetracycline or streptomycin), and 9.75% were resistant to 3 or more antimicrobial classes. Thirteen resistance profiles were characterized, the most frequent of which were the resistance to tetracycline (15.85%); to the combination of trimethroprim with sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline (10.97%); and to the combination of streptomycin and tetracycline (9.75%). Multiple correspondence analysis revealed that susceptibility or resistance of the analyzed strains and also particular Salmonella serotypes were associated with broiler-producing companies where the samples were collected. Strains presented high intraserotype genetic variability, as shown by the 64 PFGE profiles, suggesting the existence of several contamination sources in the surveyed farms.
