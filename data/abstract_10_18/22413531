Previously unrecognized or underrecognized antimicrobial resistant bacteria, including NDM-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, were recently identified in health care facilities in Japan. Vigilance in the clinical microbiology laboratory for these organisms is the key to early recognition of their emergence. Many of these organisms can be confirmed or at least suspected through routine susceptibility testing, which can then be referred to reference laboratories for further phenotypic or genetic testing. Antimicrobial resistance testing plays a crucial role in patient management, infection control and monitoring of local as well as national and international epidemiology.
