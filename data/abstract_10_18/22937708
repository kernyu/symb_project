AIM: Study bacterial biofilms in native material (renal calculus) by electron microscopy method and developmeit of biofilm model by isolates in vitro on sterile calculi of various chemical composition. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bacterial spectra of microflora of renal calculus lavages were studied, isolated pure cultures were identified up to species. Comparisons of urine microflora obtained before operation in patients with urolithiasis with microflora of removed renal calculi were carried out. RESULTS: Urease activity and genes coding pathogenicity factors were detected, and the ability to form biofilms by isolates was studied. Model of formation of biofilms in vitro on sterile renal calculi was developed and candidate agents reducing the biofilm forming ability were tested. CONCLUSION: Uropathogenic microorganisms infecting renal calculi and forming biofilms on them not only support chronic infection by increased resistance to therapy but also facilitate novel lithogenesis.
