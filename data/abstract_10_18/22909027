OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the anti-folate (sulphadoxine)-resistant pattern in Kolkata, one of the malaria endemic zones of Eastern India. METHODS: At first, 107 P. falciparum suspected cases were enrolled in this study. Ninety isolates (84.11%) of 107 suspected cases were analysed, as they had mono-infection with P. falciparum. In vitro susceptibility assays were performed in all 90 isolates. Parasitic DNA was isolated by phenol-chloroform extraction method and polymerase chain reaction was followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of different codons of the pfdhps gene (436, 437, 540, 581 and 613). RESULTS: Among 90 isolates from Kolkata, dhps mutant isolates at codons 436, 437, 540, 581 and 613 were found in 53.33%, 67.78%, 46.66%, 15.56% and 45.55%, respectively. In vitro sulphadoxine resistance was found in 49 isolates (54.44%). Interestingly we found 33 isolates (36.67%) with quadruple AGEAT mutant allele, of which 32 isolates (96.97%) were highly sulphadoxine resistant (P < 0.01) in vitro. CONCLUSION: Our present findings implicate that because of enormous drug (sulphfadoxine) pressure, novel AGEAT mutation was highly correlated (P < 0.01) with sulphadoxine resistance.
