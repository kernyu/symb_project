This study determined the prevalence of Salmonella serovars, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and resistance genes in Salmonella isolated from retail meats purchased in Alberta, Canada. Samples were collected during one year period (May 2007-April 2008) on weekly basis from 19 census divisions in Alberta. A total of 564 samples including chicken (n = 206), turkey (n = 91), beef (n = 134) and pork (n = 133) were purchased. Salmonella were recovered from chicken (40%), turkey (27%) and pork (2%) samples and was not found in ground beef. A total of 21, 8, and 3 different serovars were recovered from chicken, turkey and pork meats, respectively. Salmonella Hadar was most common in chicken whereas S. Heidelberg was common in turkey meat. Overall 29% (32/110) of isolates were susceptible to tested antimicrobials and resistance to ciprofloxacin, amikacin and nalidixic acid was not found in any isolate. Multiresistance (>/=2 antimicrobials) was found in 56% of isolates. Resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (AMC), ceftiofur (TIO), and ceftriaxone (CRO) was found in about 21% of chicken and 25% of turkey isolates. Resistance to either of tetracycline (TET), streptomycin (STR) or ampicillin (AMP) was unconditionally associated with S. Hadar but resistance to either of TET, AMP, AMC, TIO, CRO or cefoxitin was associated with S. Heidelberg. The strA/B (42% isolates), tet(A) (28% isolates), bla(CMY-2) (21% isolates) and bla(TEM) (17% isolates) were the most common resistance genes found. The bla(CMY-2) and bla(TEM) genes were unconditionally associated with S. Heidelberg; tet(A) and strA/B with S. Hadar and tet(B) gene with S. Kentucky. The strA/B genes were not associated with S. Heidelberg. Our data suggests that the prevalence of Salmonella serovars varied by the meat type and that AMR and resistance genes varied by the Salmonella serovars.
