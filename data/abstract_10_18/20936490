Zinc eluted from siliconized latex (SL) increases resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to imipenem in vitro. A foreign body peritonitis model was used to evaluate the activity of imipenem using SL or silicone (S) implants. No differences were observed in mortality, positive blood cultures and tissue bacterial counts between SL and S implants. Implant-associated counts, however, were significantly higher in the SL group. It is concluded that SL decreases the activity of imipenem against P. aeruginosa.
