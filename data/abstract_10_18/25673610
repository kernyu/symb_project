Enteric fever caused by Salmonella enterica is a systemic infection with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Increasing antibiotic resistance in S. enterica has led to shift in the choice of antibiotics used against this organism from chloramphenicol and ampicillin to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, fluoroquinolones, and extended-spectrum cephalosporins. Resistance to cephalosporins, due to the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), is the cause of serious concern worldwide. So far, these enzymes have been detected in many species of the family Enterobacteriaceae including different serotypes of S. enterica. To the best of our knowledge, however, ESBL production in Salmonella Paratyphi A has not yet been reported from India. We present here a case of ESBL producing Salmonella Paratyphi A from India. This is a worrisome finding with grave clinical implications, since the dissemination of this resistance trait would further limit the therapeutic options available for the treatment of enteric fever.
