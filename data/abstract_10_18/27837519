Fungal infections have increased significantly in the last few years, and their outcomes are in part complicated by the emergence of antifungal drug-resistant pathogens. Together with Candida species, the mould Aspergillus fumigatus is one of the most prevalent organisms to cause invasive fungal disease. The molecular detection of (tri)azole resistance in both Candida and Aspergillus species may represent a useful means of monitoring the incidence of clinical isolates with antifungal resistance-associated gene alterations. Here, we describe molecular methods that have been developed to allow for accurate detection of azole-resistant isolates among C. glabrata and A. fumigatus fungal species.
