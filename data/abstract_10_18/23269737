The mechanisms of linezolid resistance among 86 staphylococcal isolates from two intensive care units were investigated. The most frequent was the G2576T mutation in the 23S rRNA (82%). The cfr gene was found in 17% of the isolates, seven S. aureus and eight S. epidermidis isolates. Four of the S. epidermidis isolates had the G2576T mutation and the cfr gene. In four S. haemolyticus isolates, the mechanism could not be identified.
