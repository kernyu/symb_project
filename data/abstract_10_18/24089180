OBJECTIVE: To describe the experience of planning and designing a new facility for infectious diseases in Sweden and to discuss underlying theories relating to infection prevention and evidence-based design. BACKGROUND: Departments of Infectious Diseases are common in healthcare facililties in Sweden. In 2005, a decision was made to build a new facility. The program required spacious single rooms, with a high ventilation standard, and anterooms. METHODS: In this article we present an analysis of the future of infectious diseases. Underlying theories are discussed. We also describe how a program was outlined using literature studies, including evidence-based healthcare design, focus groups of staff, and study visits. RESULTS: Active involvement of users and infection control specialists was important in the building process. A full-scale patient room mock-up was built with ventilation, electrical, and other systems. The mock-up was cost effective because it avoided costly mistakes during the building process. The mock-up also was a place where staff could assess and begin adapting to their future work environment. Separate ventilation and separate entrances to patient rooms from the building exterior allowed placement of isolation units in the main hospital area. CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial resistance, emerging diseases, healthcare associated infections, and outbreaks highlight the need for infection control measures in all hospital design. Infection control should be integrated in all hospital planning and be part of contracts. In this study we describe a specialized unit where a high degree of standardization and flexibility has made it possible to have a unique standard of preparedness for the post-antibiotic era. KEYWORDS: Design process, evidence-based design, infection control, planning, safety.
