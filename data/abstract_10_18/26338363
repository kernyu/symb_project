New tertiary amide derivatives of polyether ionophore Monensin A (MON) were synthesised and their anti-proliferative activity against cancer cell lines was studied. Very high activity (IC50=0.09 muM) and selectivity (SI=232) of MON against human biphenotypic myelomonocytic leukemia cell line (MV4-11) was demonstrated. The MON derivatives obtained exhibit interesting anti-proliferative activity, high selectivity index and also are able to break the drug-resistance of cancer cell line.
