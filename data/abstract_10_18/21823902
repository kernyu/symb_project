Influenza is still one of the major plagues worldwide with the threatening potential to cause pandemics. In recent years, increasing levels of resistance to the four FDA approved anti-influenza virus drugs have been described. This situation underlines the urgent need for novel anti-virals in preparation for future influenza epidemics or pandemics. Although the anti-virals currently in use target viral factors such as the neuraminidase or the M2 ion channel, there is an increase in pre-clinical approaches that focus on cellular factors or pathways that directly or indirectly interact with virus replication. This does not only include inhibitors of virus-supportive signaling cascades but also interaction blockers of viral proteins with host cell proteins. This review aims to highlight some of these novel approaches that represent a paradigm change in anti-viral strategies against the influenza virus. Although most of these approaches are still in an early phase of preclinical development they might be very promising particularly with respect to the prevention of viral resistance to potential drugs.
