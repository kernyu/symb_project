In this work influence of copper, silver and gold additives on structural and surface properties of biologically active thin films based on titanium have been described. Coatings were prepared by magnetron sputtering method. During each process metallic discs (targets) - Ti and the additive (Cu, Ag or Au) were co-sputtered in argon atmosphere. Structural investigation of as-deposited coatings was performed with the aid of XRD and SEM/EDS method. It was found that all prepared thin films were homogenous. Addition of Cu, Ag and Au resulted in nanocrystalline structure. Moreover, influence of these additives on hardness and antibacterial activity of titanium coatings was also studied. Ti-Cu, Ti-Ag and Ti-Au films had lower hardness as-compared to Ti. According to AAS results the difference of their activity was related to the ion migration process. It was found that Ti-Ag and Ti-Au coatings had biocidal effect related to direct contact of their surface with microorganisms. In the case of Ti-Cu antimicrobial activity had direct and indirect nature due to efficient ion migration process from the film surface to the surrounding environment. Functional features of coatings such as wettability and corrosion resistance were also examined and included in the comprehensive analysis.
