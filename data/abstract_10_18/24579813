With a broad-spectrum of activity, fluoroquinolones have been widely and successfully used for decades for the treatment of and prophylaxis against various bacterial infections, including community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). However, the use of fluoroquinolones has been compromised by the emergence and spreading of bacterial resistance and the potential for adverse effects. Therefore, there is an unmet need for newer compounds that have a broader spectrum of activity to overcome existing bacterial resistance as well as the potential to minimize the risk of adverse effects. Nemonoxacin (TG-873870), a newly developed quinolone, has demonstrated broad-spectrum activity against Gram-positive, Gram-negative and atypical pathogens, including drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Results from Phases I and II studies of treatment of CAP are encouraging. This article reviews the updated data on nemonoxacin, including the bacterial susceptibility, the pharmacologic characteristics, and toxicities, and clinical trials using nemonoxacin for treatment of CAP.
