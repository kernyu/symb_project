Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative bacterium that is frequently related to natural resistance to many drugs. In this work, the inhibition of growth against P. aeruginosa and multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa (MDRPA) isolated from patients at Kyungpook National University was confirmed for hibicuslide C, essential oil components from Abutilon theophrasti. Hibicuslide C has antifungal activity with membrane disruption and apoptotic response against Candida albicans. However, its antibacterial activity was not reported yet. Cells treated with hibicuslide C was showed that its antipseudomonal activity is related to gDNA fragmentation and damage by TUNEL and gDNA electrophoresis. Furthermore, hibicuslide C worked synergistically with fluoroquinolones and rifampicin against MDRPA regardless of the ATP-associated mechanism. The antibiofilm activity possessed sole-resulting tissue culture plate method; besides that, the antibiofilm activity of other antibiotics was supported in particular MDRPA. The essential oil components like hibicuslide C may have antipseudomonal activity and, furthermore, increase in bacterial antibiotic susceptibility.
