OBJECTIVES: Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) infections have emerged worldwide as a serious challenge to public health. Tigecycline is regarded as one of the last-resort antimicrobials for CRKP infections. Here we report the draft genome sequence of a clinical tigecycline-resistant KPC-2-producing K. pneumoniae isolate (TRKP1). METHODS: Whole-genome sequencing of strain TRKP1 was performed using an Illumina Hiseq X Ten system. The generated reads were assembled using CLC Genomics Workbench. Functional annotation was performed by the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP) server. Bioinformatics analysis was further performed. RESULTS: Klebsiella pneumoniae TRKP1 belongs to sequence type ST15, corresponding to clonal complex CC23. The total genome length of the isolate was 5609823bp, harbouring 19 genes relevant to antibiotic resistance. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that the isolate is resistant to all antibiotics except colistin. CONCLUSIONS: The genome sequence of K. pneumoniae TRKP1 will facilitate the understanding of drug resistance mechanisms and genomic features of clinically isolated tigecycline-resistant CRKP.
