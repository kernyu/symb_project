Despite the widespread use of highly effective chemoimmunotherapy (CIT), fludarabine-refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remains a challenging clinical problem associated with poor overall survival (OS). The traditional definition, which includes those patients with no response or relapse within 6 months of fludarabine, is evolving with the recognition that even patients with longer remissions of up to several years after CIT have poor subsequent treatment response and survival. Approved therapeutic options for these patients remain limited, and the goal of therapy for physically fit patients is often to achieve adequate cytoreduction to proceed to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). Fortunately, several novel targeted therapeutics in clinical trials hold promise of significant benefit for this patient population. This review discusses the activity of available and novel therapeutics in fludarabine-refractory or fludarabine-resistant CLL as well as recently updated data on alloSCT in CLL.
