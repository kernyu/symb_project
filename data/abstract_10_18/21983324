Nasal colonization with community acquired methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is being increasingly reported, especially in places where people are in close contact and in reduced hygiene, such as day-care centers. In this study we investigated the frequency of MRSA colonization and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns in 1-6 years old children of day-care centers in Hamadan, West of Iran.Five hundred nasal swabs were collected from children of 27 day-care centers that had no risk factors for colonization by S. aureus. The specimens were cultured for isolation of S. aureus by standard methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. For evaluation of the frequency of erythromycin induced clindamycin resistance, disk approximation test (D-test) was applied.Totally, 148 (29.6%) children were colonized by S. aureus. Out of 260 male, 94 (36.2%) and of 240 female, 54 (22.5%) cases were nasal carriers of S. aureus (P value = 0.001). Six (4.1%) of the 148 S. aureus isolated from children were MRSA strains. None of MRSA and methicillin susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) was resistant to vancomycin and clindamycin. Three of the 6 strains of MRSA and 7 (4.9%) of the 142 MSSA strains were resistant to erythromycin, and D-test was positive in all of them.We conclude that the rate of colonization by S. aureus is high in children attending day-care centers but colonization with MRSA is not common in our areas. Clindamycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazol could be used in mild to moderataly severe diseases caused by CA-MRSA. However, if the CA-MRSA isolates are erythromycin resistant, D-test should be carried out for detection of inducible clindamycin resistance.
