Molecular drug susceptibility testing was performed on 39 US patients with leprosy. Of these, 2 had dapsone-resistant Mycobacterium leprae and 1 of these patients also had rifampin-resistant M. leprae. Even though antileprosy drug resistance occurs in this leprosy population, resistance does not appear to be a major problem.
