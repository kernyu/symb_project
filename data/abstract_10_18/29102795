Various metal coated implants have been tested against dental pathogens which causes increased biofilm formation and lead to failure of dental implants. The possibility of using nanoparticle together with native biomolecules to enhance the activity of such bioactive compound is also in progress. In this study we tested the efficacy of Ag conjugated chitosan nanoparticles as a prospective coating material of titanium dental implants. Known bioactive molecule chitosan was extracted from A. flavus Af09 and conjugated with Ag nanoparticle. Fully characterized Ag-chitosan nanoparticle had a sound inhibitory effect on the growth of two major dental pathogens S. mutans and P. gingivalis. It not only inhibits the adhesion of these two tested bacteria but also able to reduce the biofilm formation. Apart from this, nanoparticle was also able to inhibit the QS production in bacteria tested in this study. Naturally extracted chitosan has been known for its antibacterial activity for a different group of bacteria. Nanoparticles are the good option to enhance the biocompatibility. No cell cytotoxicity of nanoparticle indicates its biocompatibility and coating of titanium dental implants with Ag-chitosan may have an added advantage on the corrosion resistance of dental implants and also augments the passivating effect of these implants.
