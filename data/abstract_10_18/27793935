BACKGROUND/AIM: One reason of poor survival rate of patients with pancreatic cancer is the development of chemoresistance. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of eribulin mesylate in gemcitabine-refractory advanced pancreatic cancer cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three human pancreatic cancer cell lines (AsPC-1, Panc-1, and SUIT-2) and human pancreatic endoderm (hPE) cells were used to evaluate the antitumor effects of gemcitabine and eribulin mesylate. Cell viability after treatment of cells with different concentrations of gemcitabine and eribulin mesylate was evaluated using water-soluble tetrazolium salts (WST) assays; cytotoxic effects were evaluated on the basis of morphological changes to cells. RESULTS: Gemcitabine had no effect on cell viability of AsPC-1 nor Panc-1 cells, whereas gemcitabine reduced cell viability of SUIT-2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Eribulin mesylate significantly reduced cell viability of both AsPC-1 and Panc-1 cells (p<0.001 and p=0.002, respectively), but had no effect on hPE cells. Microscopic examination of AsPC-1 and Panc-1 cells after treatment with eribulin mesylate revealed morphological changes that included cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, and fragmentation of the cells after drug exposure, and these were concentration-dependent effects. CONCLUSION: The findings of the present study suggest that eribulin mesylate may be a promising potential anticancer drug for gemcitabine-refractory advanced pancreatic cancer.
