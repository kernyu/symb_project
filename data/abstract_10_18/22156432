We report the discovery of a CTX-M-15-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) of serogroup O111:H8, a major serotype responsible for human enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) infections. In line with the recent CTX-M-15/O104:H4 E. coli outbreak, these data may reflect an accelerating spread of resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins within the E. coli population, including STEC isolates.
