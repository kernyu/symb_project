Detailed mutational analysis examines the roles of individual residues of the Vga(A) linker in determining the antibiotic resistance phenotype. It defines a narrowed region of residues 212 to 220 whose composition determines the resistance specificity to lincosamides, pleuromutilins, and/or streptogramins A. From the analogy with the recently described function of the homologous ABC-F protein EttA as a translational factor, we infer that the Vga(A) linker interacts with the ribosome and directly or indirectly affects the binding of the respective antibiotic.
