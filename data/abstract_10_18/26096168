Metabolic syndrome is characterized with abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and hepatic dysfunction. Glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) expression has been observed in adipose tissues in obese and diabetic humans, and in rodents. The aim of study was to investigate role of GSK-3beta in modulation of metabolic alterations in alcoholic fed rats. Male Wistar albino rats (180-220 g) were used. High fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks and alcohol (2%) from third to eighth week were given. Lithium chloride (LiCl), a GSK-3beta inhibitor (60 mg/kg) was used orally from third to eighth week. HFD treatment caused significant (p < 0.05) increase in the percentage of body weight gain, BMI, Lee index, different fat pads, liver weights, serum glucose, leptin, triglyceride, LDL, VLDL, cholesterol, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, tissue thio-barbituric acid reactive substances, nitrate/nitrite and significant decrease in food intake (g), serum HDL and tissue GSH in HFD control rats, as compared to normal control (NC). Administration of alcohol (2%) ad libitum potentiated the effect of normal and HFD, respectively, in NC and HFD control rats, respectively. Administration of LiCl produced significant amelioration in biochemical and pathological changes caused in the form of metabolic syndrome in HFD alone and HFD and alcohol-treated rats. The histological observations also showed similar findings in liver tissue. It may be concluded that inactivation of GSK-3beta consequently leads to increased leptin and insulin sensitivity as evidenced by the reversal of alterations caused due to metabolic syndrome in rodents fed with HFD and mild alcohol.
