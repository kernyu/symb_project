Objectives: The UK Five Year Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Strategy was published in September 2013 and recommended a One Health approach emphasizing the importance of collaboration to tackle AMR. We describe the inauguration of what we believe to be the first regional One Health group established in the UK. The purpose of the group was to ensure the implementation of a coordinated Cornwall-wide response to the UK AMR Strategy and we describe the outputs of the group to date. Methods: The Cornwall Antimicrobial Resistance Group was set up as a sub-group of the Health & Wellbeing Board's Health Protection Committee. Stakeholders reviewed the key objectives set out within the Five Year AMR strategy, identified local priorities and existing work streams within Cornwall, and completed a gap analysis. The annual work plan was developed from the gap analysis and provided a foundation for improved coordination of One Health antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) activity in Cornwall. Results: To date, outputs from the group can be arranged under the following themes: education and engagement with the public; education and engagement with healthcare workers and veterinarians; and a comprehensive AMS programme for all sectors. The group continues to grow in size with wider stakeholder engagement and increased variety of work streams. Conclusions: This unique group facilitates discussions across sectors, which has enabled the sharing of knowledge, ideas and resources, stimulated local AMS initiatives, and ensured a platform for the development of future AMR and AMS work.
