OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical features of mixed types of pulmonary aspergillosis (MTPA), and therefore to improve the diagnosis and treatment of MTPA. METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed 3 patients with MTPA in Peking University First Hospital from November 2010 to 2012. "Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), pulmonary aspergilloma, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA)" were used as the Chinese and English keywords, to search the literatures from Wanfang database and Pubmed database until to May 2014. RESULTS: There were 3 patients with MTPA, respectively with aspergilloma and IPA (patient 1), ABPA and IPA (patient 2), aspergilloma and IPA (patient 3). The cultures of respiratory secretions of the patients all yielded A.fumigatus. Patient 1 was treated by amphotericin B; Patient 2 was treated by intravenous itraconazole and glucocorticoid; Patient 3 was treated by oral voriconazole and inhaled corticosteroid, and the aspergilloma was surgically removed at the same time. Eventually, patients 1 and 2 died, while the symptoms of patient 3 were significantly improved. Drug sensitivity test of A. fumigatus showed resistance to amphotericin B or itraconazole. By far there was no concept of MTPA in the literatures and there were only 3 relevant case reports. CONCLUSION: MTPA is a new subtype of pulmonary aspergillosis, which is more complicated and severe, and perhaps with drug resistance. MTPA should be treated by comprehensive therapies on the basis of sensitive and effective antifungal drugs.
