The spread of antimicrobial resistance among Enterobacteriaceae is a significant clinical threat. We report the first case of an Enterobacteriaceae strain harboring the NDM-1 metallo-beta-lactamase in a pediatric patient in the United States. We describe strategies for the detection of this novel resistance mechanism encountered in an isolate of Klebsiella pneumoniae.
