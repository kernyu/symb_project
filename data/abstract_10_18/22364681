BACKGROUND: The prevalence of meticillin- and multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) in canine pyoderma has been increasing in recent years; thus, treatment of these cases has become challenging. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To compare treatment outcome (clinical resolution and treatment duration), adverse effects of medication, and concurrent diseases and medications in dogs with meticillin-susceptible S. pseudintermedius (MSSP) and MRSP pyoderma. ANIMALS/METHODS: Medical records were reviewed retrospectively, and 123 MSSP and 93 MRSP clinical cases between January 2008 and April 2010 were included. RESULTS: In MSSP infections, cefalexin and cefpodoxime were the most commonly prescribed antimicrobials, accounting for 43.2 and 34.4% of cases, respectively. In MRSP infections, chloramphenicol and doxycycline were most commonly prescribed, accounting for 52.6 and 14.4% of cases, respectively. Adverse effects were reported in seven MSSP and 31 MRSP cases. The most commonly reported adverse effects were gastrointestinal, prompting antibiotic discontinuation in three MSSP and 20 MRSP cases. Chloramphenicol was associated with the highest incidence of adverse reactions (27 of 51 cases). Of 164 cases with follow up, 43 of 88 MSSP infections and 29 of 76 MRSP infections achieved complete clinical resolution at the first recheck examination. Three MSSP and seven MRSP cases failed to improve or resolve at subsequent visits assessed at 3-4 week intervals. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Results from this study showed that the majority of pyodermas resolved regardless of meticillin susceptibility. Although some cases of MRSP pyoderma took longer to treat, this is likely to be because of chronicity and not the organism. In addition, adverse effects were frequently associated with chloramphenicol administration.
