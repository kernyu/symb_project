Despite world-wide efforts in fighting malaria, this mosquito-borne infectious disease is a huge burden for the population, especially in tropical and subtropical areas. The WHO recommends artemisinin-based combination therapy for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. However, artemisinin resistance cannot now be ignored. Factors affecting the development of artemisinin resistance include uncontrolled use of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), mobile populations and migrants, artemisinin monotherapy, the use of subtherapeutic levels of artesiminin, substandard and counterfeit drugs, high treatment cost, and co-use of artemisinin derivates as prophylactic agents. Promising herbal alternatives are already in the pipeline, but the only long-term solution for eradicating malaria would be the development of a successful vaccination.
