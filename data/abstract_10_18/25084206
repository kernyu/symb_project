Nucleoside analogs such as gemcitabine and 5-fluorouracil are currently the cornerstone of chemotherapy in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Decreased drug transport into tumor cells that may be caused by low expression of membrane proteins, such as solute carrier transporters, represents one of the principal mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance. Individual diversity of multidrug resistance is the major challenge limiting the success of anticancer treatment. Novel biomarkers and pharmacogenomic approaches could further optimize treatment algorithms leading to better survival and lower treatment toxicity in PDAC patients. In this review, the most promising predictive biomarkers from the solute carrier transporter family of membrane transporters and the potential applications for PDAC therapy with nucleoside analogues are summarized.
