Interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor signaling is necessary for control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, yet the role of its two ligands, IL-1alpha and IL-1beta, and their regulation in vivo are poorly understood. Here, we showed that both IL-1alpha and IL-1beta are critically required for host resistance and identified two multifunctional inflammatory monocyte-macrophage and DC populations that coexpressed both IL-1 species at the single-cell level in lungs of Mtb-infected mice. Moreover, we demonstrated that interferons (IFNs) played important roles in regulating IL-1 production by these cells in vivo. Type I interferons inhibited IL-1 production by both subsets whereas CD4(+) T cell-derived IFN-gamma selectively suppressed monocyte-macrophages. These data provide a cellular basis for both the anti-inflammatory effects of IFNs and probacterial functions of type I IFNs during Mtb infection and reveal differential regulation of IL-1 production by distinct cell populations as an additional layer of complexity in the activity of IL-1 in vivo.
