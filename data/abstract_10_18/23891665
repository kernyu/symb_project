CRISPRs (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) are short fragments of DNA that act as an adaptive immune system protecting bacteria against invasion by phages, plasmids or other forms of foreign DNA. Bacteria without a CRISPR locus may more readily adapt to environmental changes by acquiring foreign genetic material. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) live in a number of environments suggesting an ability to rapidly adapt to new environments. If UPEC are more adaptive than commensal E. coli we would expect that UPEC would have fewer CRISPR loci, and--if loci are present--that they would harbor fewer spacers than CRISPR loci in fecal E. coli. We tested this in vivo by comparing the number of CRISPR loci and spacers, and sensitivity to antibiotics (resistance is often obtained via plasmids) among 81 pairs of UPEC and fecal E. coli isolated from women with urinary tract infection. Each pair included one uropathogen and one commensal (fecal) sample from the same female patient. Fecal isolates had more repeats (p=0.009) and more unique spacers (p<0.0001) at four CRISPR loci than uropathogens. By contrast, uropathogens were more likely than fecal E. coli to be resistant to ampicillin, cefazolin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. However, no consistent association between CRISPRs and antibiotic resistance was identified. To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare fecal E. coli and pathogenic E. coli from the same individuals, and to test the association of CRISPR loci with antibiotic resistance. Our results suggest that the absence of CRISPR loci may make UPEC more susceptible to infection by phages or plasmids and allow them to adapt more quickly to various environments.
