Klebsiella pneumoniae showing high resistance to all beta-lactams except imipenem, designated as ISMRK (imipenem-susceptible meropenem-resistant Klebsiella) is emerging in Japan. The carbapenem resistance of ISMRK cannot be screened by the Vitek and the RAISUS rapid automated susceptibility test systems, which may lead to inappropriate antimicrobial therapy, resulting in compromised patient outcomes.
