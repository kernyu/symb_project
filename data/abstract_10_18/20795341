OBJECTIVE: To determine the outcome of secondary management in drug-resistant gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN). STUDY DESIGN: Sixteen of 60 patients with GTN (8 low-risk and 8 high-risk) who developed resistance to primary chemotherapy were studied retrospectively. Primary chemotherapy was methotrexate-folinic acid rescue (MTX-FA) for low risk and etoposide/methotrexate/actinomycin D/cyclophosphamide/vincristine (EMA-CO) for high risk. Secondary chemotherapy for the low-risk group was either actinomycin D or EMA-CO, depending on serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels at resistance. For the high-risk group, etoposide/methotrexate/actinomycin D/cisplatinum (EMA-EP) or bleomycin/etoposide/cisplatin (BEP) was given. Third-line chemotherapy was vincristine/actinomycin D/cyclophosphamide (VAC) or vincristine/ iphosphamide/cisplatin (VIP). Surgery and radiotherapy were used in selected patients. RESULTS: Survival after salvage therapy in low-risk patients was 100%: 2 with EMA-CO and 6 with actinomycin D. Of high-risk cases 75% were cured with EMA-EP or BEP. Third-line chemotherapy was given in 2 patients: 1 was lost to follow-up and the other died. Survival was significantly influenced by both hCG level at the start of secondary therapy and site of metastasis. CONCLUSION: Prognosis in GTN is excellent. Optimization of treatment strategies for those who develop drug resistance remains a key challenge.
