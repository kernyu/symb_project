Domestic researchers succeeded to create a group of original interferon inducers (II) with a high chemotherapeutic index and suitable for the prevention and treatment of viral infections and a number of other diseases. Clinical application of II concerns, first of all, a wide range of viral infections: influenza and other acute respiratory viral infections, herpes, hepatitis, encephalitis, rabies, slow and mixed infections, etc. The accumulated experience is generalized and the conclusion is made about the main advantages of II, which induce a balanced synthesis of endogenous interferon without antigenicity of its own. It is emphasized that a single injection of II "includes" synthesis of IFN in certain populations of cells and organs and provides a relatively long circulation of IFN at a therapeutic level and creation of long-term anti-virus resistance. It is concluded that, in general, interferon inducers with pronounced antiviral and immunomodulatory properties are currently used as effective tools for the prevention and treatment of a variety of diseases. The fact that II different in their chemical nature act at different stages of reproduction of viruses and affect various links of the innate and adaptive immunity explains the increased scope of the application of this group of drugs in medical practice.
