Our study provides an alert regarding the transmission of rifampin-susceptible strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis with a silent substitution in codon 514 of rpoB. Among 1,450 cases, we identified 12 isolates sharing this mutation and related restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) types. The mutation impaired hybridization with the wild-type probes in three independent commercial assays, which could lead to misassignment of resistance.
