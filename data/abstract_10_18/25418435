Silver is a naturally occurring element. Similar to other metals, the ionized form of silver (Ag(+1)) has known antimicrobial properties. A number of wound dressings incorporating silver ion or silver compounds have recently been developed and marketed. In addition, the antimicrobial effects of silver are currently being promoted in consumer products such as clothing and household appliances. The present use of silver in medical and consumer products has prompted concerns for potential toxicity and ecological effects, including induction of microbial resistance to antibiotics. These concerns ignore the fact that silver has been used for medicinal purposes for several thousand years. A historical review of the uses of silver in medicine is presented.
