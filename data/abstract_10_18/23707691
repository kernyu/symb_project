AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the genotypes of mupirocin-resistant methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MR-MRSA) isolates in our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and their potential source. STUDY DESIGN: One hundred one MRSA isolates obtained from 59 inborn and 42 outborn infants were identified and their antimicrobial susceptibility determined. Using pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis, MR-MRSA isolates obtained from the neonatal patients in the NICU were compared with those from adult hospitalized in the same hospital and with community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) isolates recovered from different hospitals in Korea. RESULTS: Overall, 47% of CA-MRSA and 79% of healthcare-associated MRSA isolates exhibited high-level mupirocin resistance (HLMR). Forty-five percent of the outborn infants were considered to have CA-MRSA at the time of admission to our NICU. Most HLMR-MRSA isolates from neonates were grouped into a single cluster by PFGE analysis, and which included CA-MRSA isolates with HLMR recovered from outborn infants who were already colonized when they were transferred to our NICU. They belonged to the same PFGE group as the community-genotype strains isolated from different hospitals in Korea. HLMR-MRSA isolates from adults patients were classified as different clones. None of the attending staff in the NICU were nasal carriers. CONCLUSION: Community-genotype strains of MRSA with HLMR may be imported to our NICU through obstetrics clinics and contribute to MRSA colonization or infection in facilities with a high rate of admission of outborn infants.
