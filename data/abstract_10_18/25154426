Secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA), as a vital actor involving in the mucosal immunity, plays a key role in defending a variety of pathogenic infections, such as bacteria, viruses and parasites. Eimeria tenella is an obligate intracellular apicomplexan parasite contacting with the digestive tract mucosa and specially parasitizes chicken caecum, causing a severe form of coccidiosis. Coccidiosis is currently mainly controlled using chemotherapeutic agents. Diclazuril, a classic coccidiostat, was used widely in the poultry industry. Because of the rising problem of drug resistance, it is therefore crucial to understand the pattern of the SIgA expression in the action of diclazuril against E. tenella. In this study, the intestinal morphology in the caecum was analyzed by haematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, and the SIgA expression was examined by immunohistochemical technique. At the same time, the duodenum, jejunum and ileum tissues have also been evaluated. HE staining results showed that E. tenella infection caused severe damage characterized by structural disorder, haemorrhage, inflammatory cell infiltration, serous and fibrinous exudation in chicken caecum and invisible damage in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum. With the treatment of diclazuril, the damage in the caecum was alleviated obviously. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that the SIgA level in the infected group was increased in the duodenum (p < 0.05), jejunum and ileum, respectively, but decreased (p < 0.01) in the caecum, compared with the control group. Interestingly, the SIgA level was decreased in the duodenum (p < 0.05), jejunum and ileum but increased (p < 0.05) in the caecum in the infected/diclazuril group in comparison to the infected group. The results showed that diclazuril effectively alleviated the damage in the caecum induced by E. tenella and provided a cure for coccidiosis by improving the immune function in chickens.
