Genetic mechanisms of methicillin resistance are still relevant in staphylococci. The aims of this study are to assess the possible exchanges of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) among isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRS) and to check for known or new mutations in mecA DNA. A total of 35 MRS non-repetitive isolates were recovered, including 20 Staphylococcushaemolyticus, 7 Staphylococcusaureus, 4 Staphylococcussciuri, 2 Staphylococcussaprophyticus and 1 isolate each of Staphylococcusxylosus and Staphylococcuslentus. Only 16 of the 35 strains were assigned to known SCCmec types: 7 SCCmec VII, 6 SCCmec IV and 3 SCCmec III, with possible horizontal transfer of the SCCmec VII from methicillin-resistant S. haemolyticus to methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. mecA gene sequencing in ten selected isolates allowed description of nine punctual mutations, seven of which were reported for the first time. The most frequent mutation was G246E, identified in isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus, S. sciuri, S. saprophyticus and S. lentus. These results emphasized the high degree of genetic diversity of SCCmec element in MRS and describe new missense mutations in mecA, which might be important in understanding the evolution of methicillin and new beta-lactam resistance.
