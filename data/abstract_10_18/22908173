Herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) are responsible for lifelong latent infections in humans, with periods of viral reactivation associated with recurring ulcerations in the orofacial and genital tracts. In immunosuppressed patients and neonates, HSV infections are associated with severe morbidity and, in some cases, even mortality. Today, acyclovir is the standard therapy for the management of HSV infections. However, the need for novel antiviral agents is apparent, since HSV isolates resistant to acyclovir therapy are frequently isolated in immunosuppressed patients. In this study, we assessed the anti-HSV activity of the antiadenoviral compounds 2-[2-(2-benzoylamino)-benzoylamino]benzoic acid (benzavir-1) and 2-[4,5-difluoro-2-(2-fluorobenzoylamino)-benzoylamino]benzoic acid (benzavir-2) on HSV-1 and HSV-2. Both compounds were active against both viruses. Importantly, benzavir-2 had potency similar to that of acyclovir against both HSV types, and it was active against clinical acyclovir-resistant HSV isolates.
