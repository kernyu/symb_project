Periodization of the evolution of epidemic process of hepatitis C is given based on the results of phylodynamic, phylogeographic, historic and demographic studies: invasion of the virus into European and North-American population in 1700-1850; primary activation of the epidemic process in the years of the World War 1; expansive giowth of prevalence in 40--60s of the 20th century due to mass parenteral interventions; new rise due to heroine drug abuse in 60--80s of the 20th century; manifold reduction of incidence of acute hepatitis C in industrial countries for the last 10-15 years as a result of general medical measures of prevention of hemocontact infec-tions. A problem of possibility of hepatitis C management and necessity of evaluation of effectiveness of existing prophylaxis measures involving quantitative analytical methods of epidemiology is discussed. Data from phylogenetic studies on stages of hepatitis C virus evolution (HCV) are provided: division of its root genetic lineage with homologous hepaciviruses of animals 985--2013 years ago; division of HCV into genotypes 500--2000 years ago; division of genotypes into subtypes 70--300 years ago. Contribution of mutations and genetic recombinations into HCV evolution is discussed. Genotyping is stated as an inefficient approach for determination of pathogenicity determinants, immune evasion, non-responsiveness to therapy, as well as search for predictors of infection outcome. A necessity of genomic approach for these aims is justified, as well as for risk monitoring, ensuing from continuing evolution and biodiversity of HCV and other hepaciviruses.
