BACKGROUND: Campylobacter sp.- one of the leading causes of bacterial food-borne gastrointestinal illness worldwide- is increasingly resistant to fluoroquinolone and macrolide antimicrobials, which has become a major concern for public health. OBJECTIVE: To describe the susceptibility patterns of Campylobacter jejuni strains to erythromycin and ciprofloxacin and to explore the origin of its resistance in human isolates. MATERIAL AND METHOD: In this study, fifty-five ciprofloxacin and erythromycin susceptibility patterns of C. jejuni strains isolated from humans with diarrheal disease, performed by broth microdilution MIC, were compared with 55 and 44 isolates from chicken meat and bovines respectively, obtained from the Metropolitan Region, Chile. RESULTS: Of the 55 human isolates of C. jejuni, 33 (60%) were resistant to ciprofloxacin and all were sensitive to erythromycin. Of the 55 isolates from chicken meat, 32 (58.2%) were resistant to ciprofloxacin and 1.8% were resistant to erythromycin. Of the 44 isolates of C. jejuni from cattle, 8 (18.2%) were resistant to ciprofloxacin and all were sensitive to erythromycin. Four PFGE patterns matched with certain resistance profiles and grouped isolates from human and animal. CONCLUSION: The findings showed continued effectiveness of erythromycin for campylobacteriosis and a high percentage of C. jejuni strains ciprofloxacin-resistant. This is interesting because it is considered that the presence of ciprofloxacin resistant strains in broiler meat can be in part the source of resistance to this antimicrobial in humans.
