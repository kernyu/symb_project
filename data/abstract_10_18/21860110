PURPOSE: Ofloxacin (OFX) is one of the potent fluoroquinolone (FQ) recommended to treat MDR-TB. Over a decade, the preexposure of this drug for the treatment of other bacterial infections has resulted in acquisition of FQ resistance among Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. Considering this possibility, a study was undertaken in a tertiary care center in the capital city (India) to assess the drug resistance trends of OFX among susceptible and multidrug resistant (MDR) strains of M. tuberculosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 102 M. tuberculosis isolates (47 susceptible to first-line drugs and 55 MDR isolates) were screened for susceptibility testing of OFX with a critical concentration of 2 mug/ml by Lowenstein Jensen (LJ) proportion method. RESULTS: The results showed 40 (85.1%) isolates among 47 susceptible isolates and 34 (61.8%) isolates among 55 MDR isolates, were found to be susceptible to OFX. Fisher's exact test showed significant P-value (0.0136) demonstrating 1.377 fold (95% confidence interval) increased risk to become resistant to OFX than susceptible isolates. These finding shows decreased OFX susceptibility is not only limited to MDR isolates but also increasingly seen in susceptible strains as a result of drug abuse. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding were not alarming, but highlights the general risk of acquiring resistance to OFX, jeopardizing the potential for these drugs to be used as second-line anti-TB agents in the management of drug-resistant TB and creating incurable TB strains .
