We document herein the prevalence and serotype distribution among Salmonella enterica strains isolated from children treated for diarrhea over two seven-year periods spanning 14 years. Four hundred and eight (1.38%) S. enterica cases were isolated among 29,601 diarrheal admissions. Among the Salmonella isolates, 63.7% were serogroup D and 29.9% were serogroup B. Overall, 21.7% of cases were under one year of age, with 2.1% being younger than three months. Bloody diarrhea was found in 18.8% of the cases. The resistance rates were 25.8%, 18.2%, 7.0%, 4.7%, and 0.3%, to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin, respectively. In conclusion, our study has revealed that the predominance of Salmonella serogroup D continues. The clinical features of our patients were mostly mild, with no deaths or severe complications. While resistance to antimicrobial agents changes constantly, it is important to keep these strains under surveillance in order to formulate policies for the rational use of antimicrobial agents.
