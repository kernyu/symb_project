The aim of this study was evaluate the spread of CTX-M-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamase variants in microorganisms involved in both hospital- and community-acquired infections in different regions of Brazil to determine their epidemiology and identify areas for further research. Thirty-six studies were included and analyzed. Most of the studies were conducted in the southeastern (66.7%, 24/36), southern (22.2%, 8/36), and northeastern (8.3%, 3/36) regions of Brazil. No study was conducted in the northern or midwestern region. CTX-M-producing bacteria were isolated exclusively from humans in both hospital and community environments. The microorganisms that were most commonly associated with the presence of the blaCTX-M gene were Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. The beta-lactamases of the CTX-M family that were most frequently identified in Brazil were CTX-M-2 and CTX-M-15, especially in the southeast where these variants are often detected. In this systematic review, the microorganisms that were most commonly associated with the presence of the blaCTX-M gene were K. pneumoniae and E. coli. CTX-M-2 and CTX-M-15 were the most dominant variants of the CTX-M family, followed by CTX-M-8, CTX-M-9, and CTX-M-59. A higher frequency of CTX-M variants was found in the southeastern region, especially in the states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, where CTX-M-2 and CTX-M-15 are predominant.
