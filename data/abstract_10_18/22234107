BACKGROUND: Moraxella catarrhalis is gaining significance as a pathogen over few decades because of increased rate of isolation in respiratory specimens and due to emergence of multidrug resistant strains. Therefore, appropriate antimicrobial agents are required for eradication and prevention of spread of the organism. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was conducted over 1-year period inpatients of lower respiratory tract infections (L.R.T.I.) in P.G.I.M.S. Rohtak (Haryana) . Assessment of clinical significance of M.catarrhalis was ascertained on the basis of preformed criteria. RESULTS: A total of 63 clinically significant M. catarrhalis were isolated from a tertiary care hospital. The isolates showed maximum resistance to cotrimoxazole (82.5%), penicillin (77.7%), and ampicillin (71.4%) while susceptibility was maximum to cefotaxime (87.3%) followed by tetracycline (85.7%) ciprofloxacin (84.1%), erythromycin (80.9%) amikacin (79.3%), gentamycin (77.7%), and cefazolin (76.2%). Multidrug resistance to >3 antimicrobials was seen in 22 (34.9%) of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Predominant or pure growth of M.catarrhalis in throat swabs from cases of L.R.T.I. should be reported and treated by microbiologist and clinician respectively. Antibiotic therapy should be decided based on sensitivity report for rapid response and recovery of patients.
