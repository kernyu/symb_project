Sequela of infectious diseases include not only morbidity and mortality, but are also associated with chronic illnesses that has long constituted public health problems and huge economic burdens. This review gives a brief idea about important infectious diseases (ID) in Egypt, the main lines taken to combat them, the challenges still existing, and the possible barriers keeping IDs still forming threats to the community. Egypt has the highest prevalence rates of HCV infection worldwide. Significant evidence points towards that the HCV epidemic was initiated and propagated by the anti-schistosomal mass campaigns during the last century. Though the rates of HCV infection are declining, still the decline has not yet met the full expectations. Therefore, infection control programs are gaining more ground all over the country, especially with the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance complicating healthcare-associated infections (HAI) worldwide. Also, mass immnunization of childhood, mycobacterial tuberculosis infections, and avian influenza will be discussed.
