INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to evaluate the enamel matrix derivative (EMD) biomaterial in nonvital immature teeth. METHODS: To arrest root development, pulpectomies were performed in the lower first molars of 36 4-week-old rats; the cavities were left exposed to the oral environment for 3 weeks. Then, chemical disinfection was performed, and triple antibiotic paste (TAP) or EMD was applied in the root canals. A control group did not receive any treatment. Radiographic and histological data were evaluated after 3 and 6 weeks. RESULTS: At 3 weeks, TAP promoted a milder inflammatory response and increased root lengths compared with the control group. At 6 weeks, root development and reduced periapical lesions could be observed in both test groups, mainly because of the deposition of a cementum-like tissue. EMD promoted narrower canals compared with TAP (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: EMD deserves attention as a potential tool in the treatment of nonvital immature teeth. The ingrowth of cementum-like tissues into canal spaces favored dental wall thickness and may contribute to tooth resistance and support.
