The identification of new anthelmintic drugs becomes a priority because of the availability of a handful of drugs, cost of treatments, and recent emergence of drug resistance. Medicinal plants are a good source of bioactive compounds for development of drugs. In this study, in vivo efficacy of Anogeissus leiocarpus was assessed in sheep naturally infected with gastrointestinal nematodes. Fecal examination, serological analyses, and necropsy were carried out to determine the egg and worm-burden reduction. The administration of ethanolic extract (single oral dose of 80 mg/kg) of A. leiocarpus induced a moderate fecal egg reduction (81 %) and adult worm-burden reduction (87 %) against Haemonchus contortus and Trichostrongylus colubriformis (82 %). The plant exhibited high efficacy against adult Strongyloides papillosus (100 %), Gaigeria pachyscelis (90 %), Cooperia curticei (100 %), and Oesophagostomum columbianum (95 %) but low efficacy against Trichostrongylus axei (67 %) and Trichuris globulosa (79 %). All these helminthes were sensitive to fenbendazole, except O. columbianum which showed a decrease susceptibility (17 %). The plant extract also improved certain biological parameters by increasing bodyweight from 0.7 +/- 2.9 to 3.3 +/- 1.9 % and improving hematocrit of 6.9 +/- 1.6 % 3-week posttreatment. It emerges from the results that the plant possesses significant effectiveness on diarrhea; all treated animals gave normal feces. This study has shown that A. leiocarpus could find an application in the control of multiparasitism in small ruminants.
