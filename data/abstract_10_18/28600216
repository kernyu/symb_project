The aim of this study was to investigate the patterns of antimicrobial resistance and molecular features of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates in Russia. Isolates recovered from hospital patients (n=480), healthy medical personnel (n=25), and healthy carriers (n=13) were included in the study. Hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) demonstrated high resistance to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and chloramphenicol (76%-92%), moderate - to tetracycline, erythromycin, clindamycin, and rifampicin (38%-54%), and low - to fusidic acid, co-trimoxazole, mupirocin, and daptomycin (2%-7%). Elevated MIC (2.0mug/ml) of vancomycin was detected in 26% of isolates. All isolates were susceptible to linezolid and tigecycline. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) revealed that CC8 isolates (ST8+ST239) constituted 83.1% of HA-MRSA and that this genetic lineage dominated in all regions from Krasnoyarsk to Saint Petersburg. A local ST239 variant harboring the tst gene (ST239Kras) was detected in Krasnoyarsk. The other HA-MRSA isolates belonged to clonal complex 5 (CC5) (21 isolates, 12.2%) and CC22 (2, 1.2%). The majority of CC5 isolates were affiliated with sequence type 228 (ST228) and were characterized with decreased susceptibility to ceftaroline (MIC=2mug/ml). We also detected, for the first time in Russia, livestock-associated MRSA (LA-MRSA) from clusters CC398 and CC97 in humans. Among the 2053 healthy persons screened for nasal carriage of S. aureus, the bacteria were isolated from 426 (21%); among them, 13 carried isolates identified as community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA). Eleven of 13 CA-MRSA isolates belonged to ST22 (spa types t223, t3243, and t3689; SCCmec types IVa and IVc, agr type I, tst-positive) and were similar to the EMRSA-15/Middle Eastern variant (Gaza strain).
