Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes serious lung infections in cystic fibrosis, non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, immunocompromised, and mechanically ventilated patients. The arsenal of conventional antipseudomonal antibiotic drugs include the extended-spectrum penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactams, polymyxins, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides but their toxicity and/or increasing antibiotic resistance are of particular concern. Improvement of existing therapies against Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections involves the use of liposomes - artificial phospholipid vesicles that are biocompatible, biodegradable, and nontoxic and able to entrap and carry hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and amphiphilic molecules to the site of action. The goal of developing liposomal antibiotic formulations is to improve their therapeutic efficacy by reducing drug toxicity and/or by enhancing the delivery and retention of antibiotics at the site of infection. The focus of this review is to appraise the current progress of the development and application of liposomal antibiotic delivery systems for the treatment pulmonary infections caused by P. aeruginosa.
