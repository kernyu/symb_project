We report the in vitro drugs interaction by the resazurin drugs combination microtiter assay (REDCA) of amoxicillin (AMO)/clavulanate (CLAV) with isoniazid (INH), ethambutol (EMB), and rifampicin (RIF) against susceptible and resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates. The addition of AMO/CLAV to classical antituberculosis drugs should be explored as a promising alternative for the treatment of resistant tuberculosis (TB).
