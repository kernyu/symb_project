Today, we are witnessing a new era for the treatment of hepatitis C with excellent rates of virologic response and very good safety profiles. Among the many classes of direct-acting antivirals, the inhibitors of nonstructural protein 5A are particularly interesting. NS5A is a phosphorylated protein with a relevant role in viral replication. HCV-NS5A inhibitors show high potency, very good safety profile and high barrier to resistance. The amazing in vitro effectiveness of this class is associated with great efficacy in clinical trials in combination protocols with antivirals of other classes, with sustained virological response (SVR) obtained in more than 90% of patients. Herein, we sought to review the current knowledge regarding the NS5A protease complex inhibitors with special emphasis on clinical efficacy and development of viral resistance.
