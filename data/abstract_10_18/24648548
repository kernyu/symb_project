Bacteremia caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) USA600 has been associated with increased patient mortality. We found that USA600 MRSA exhibited significantly increased resistance to human cathelicidin LL-37 killing and daptomycin MIC creep compared to non-USA600 MRSA. Virulent health care-associated MRSA strains may coevolve innate host defense peptide and antibiotic resistances.
