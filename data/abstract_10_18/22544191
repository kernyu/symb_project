Robust programmatic monitoring of factors associated with the emergence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drug resistance is an essential component of antiretroviral therapy (ART) program evaluation and treatment optimization. China piloted World Health Organization HIV drug resistance early warning indicators to assess the feasibility and usefulness of results. Overall, early warning indicator monitoring showed high levels of appropriate ART prescribing, low rates of loss to follow-up 12 months after ART initiation, and high rates of retention of first-line ART at 12 months. On-time drug pick-up, which may signal treatment interruptions, was identified as a challenge. HIV drug resistance early warning indicator monitoring provides a valuable assessment of ART service delivery, and its application will be scaled up throughout China.
