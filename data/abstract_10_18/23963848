Antibiotic resistance and the lack of new antibacterial agents cause major challenges for the treatment of infections. Here, we describe a simple, broad-spectrum, and low-cost dual-sided approach which uses superparamagnetic iron oxide particles (SPION) in combination with fructose metabolites as an alternative to existing antibacterial strategies. This strategy offers further improved efficacy of SPION against persistent gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria infections by manipulating the biofilm metabolic microenvironment and outperforms vancomycin (the antibiotic of last resort), creating a new nanotechnology-driven approach.
