A total of 812 samples from bovine hides and the corresponding carcasses collected at the slaughterhouse level in the eastern part of Poland were examined for the presence of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli. Recovered isolates were confirmed using species-specific PCR, characterized by the presence of 11 putative virulence genes and antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using a microbroth dilution method. Furthermore, the genotypic relatedness of the isolates was determined by PFGE profiling and virulence pattern cluster analysis. The prevalence of Campylobacter was 25.6% and 2.7% in bovine hide and carcass samples, respectively. The presence of virulence markers varied between C. jejuni and C. coli species however, the majority of strains possessed the cadF, flhA, flaA genes, irrespective of the bacterial species and origin. The lower number of the strains was positive for the invasive associated markers -virB11 and wlaN. Antibiotic profiling showed that campylobacters were most frequently resistant to quinolones and fluoroquinolones (nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin, 38.3% of each, respectively) followed by streptomycin (24.3%) and tetracycline (20.9%). Resistance to erythromycin and gentamicin was demonstrated in 4.3% and 2.6% of strains, respectively. Comparisons of the PFGE and virulence marker profiles of the isolates reflected the high genetic diversity of Campylobacter tested. Moreover, a poor correlation between the PFGE type, pathogenic gene marker and antimicrobial resistance patterns was observed.
