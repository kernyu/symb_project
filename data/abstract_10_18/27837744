Upper respiratory tract involvement in cases of tuberculosis (TB) of the head and neck continues to be described in the most recent reports from several different regions, including some from developed countries. Laryngeal TB is the most common of all forms of upper respiratory tract TB (URT-TB). Pulmonary lesions in URT-TB are present in about 20% of adults and about 50 to 60% of children. Systemic manifestations are uncommon. URT-TB is especially seen in patients with a variety of risk factors, such as the presence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, diabetes, smoking, alcoholism, drug abuse, malignancies, and use of immunosuppressive drugs. Nodules or ulcerative lesions are seen on morphological examination. Endoscopic examination is required for mucosal lesions. Diagnosis of TB is suspected on an epidemiological basis in high-prevalence countries or from the failure of a patient to respond to routine treatment. Smear and/or histopathological examinations help in establishing the final etiological diagnosis. Treatment includes standard anti-TB chemotherapy for at least 6 months with four primary drugs during the initial intensive phase of 2 months and two or three primary drugs during the remaining maintenance phase of 4 months. Treatment is modified on the basis of culture and sensitivity reports in cases of suspected drug resistance. Surgical intervention may be required for some patients with abscess formation and progressive disease unresponsive to medical therapy. Airway obstruction, although rare, even in fulminant cases may require tracheostomy for relief.
