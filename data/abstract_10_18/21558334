BACKGROUND: In contrast with HIV-1, information about drug resistance in HIV-2 is scarce and mainly derived from small series of patients failing antiretroviral therapy. METHODS: The spectrum of changes in the reverse transcriptase (RT), protease (PR) and integrase (INT) genes was examined in HIV-2 individuals enrolled in the HIV-2 Spanish register. RESULTS: From a total of 236 HIV-2-infected individuals registered in Spain from 1989 to June 2010, 53 PR, 44 RT and 8 INT sequences were obtained. Low plasma viraemia precluded collection of this information from most of the remaining cases. No major mutations associated with drug resistance in HIV-1 were recognized in 29 PR, 20 RT and 5 INT sequences from antiretroviral-naive HIV-2 individuals, although natural polymorphisms with potential effects on susceptibility to PR inhibitors were recognized at 10 positions (L10V/I, V32I, M36I, M46I, I47V, Q58E, A71V/I, G73A, V82I and L89I/V) and for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors at three positions (T69N, V75I and K219E). In 24 antiretroviral-experienced patients with virological failure the most frequent major RT resistance mutations were M184V (58%), Q151M (33%) and K65R (21%), which are rarely seen thymidine analogue mutations. In PR the most frequent major changes were V47A (17%), I54M (17%), I82F (13%), L90M (29%) and L99F (29%). Two of the three patients who failed on raltegravir had N155H in the INT region. CONCLUSIONS: Drug resistance mutations in HIV-2 are selected at the same positions as in HIV-1, although with different frequency. Polymorphisms in the RT and PR associated with drug resistance in HIV-1 as compensatory changes are common in untreated HIV-2 subjects. These findings highlight the need for specific guidelines for interpreting genotypic resistance patterns in HIV-2 infection.
