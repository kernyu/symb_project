The problem of multidrug-resistant Helicobacter pylori requires new antibiotics development. We have evaluated a potential antibiotics, moenomycin A, which is classified as a phosphoglycolipid antibiotics that targets transglycosylase and is previously thought to be limited in Gram-positive bacteria. Herein, we report the activity of moenomycin A against multidrug-resistant H. pylori and the isolates from patients with different gastrointestinal diseases.
