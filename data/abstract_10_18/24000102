PURPOSE: To investigate the incidence of surgical site infections (SSIs) according to risk factors, etiological agents, antimicrobial resistance rates of pathogens, and antimicrobial prophylaxis (AMP) in a developing country. METHODS: Prospective surveillance of SSIs was carried out in general surgery (GS) units between May 2005 and April 2009. RESULTS: SSI was diagnosed in 415 (10.8%) patients. Cefazolin was used as AMP in 780 (49%) operations, whereas broad-spectrum antibiotics were used in the remaining operations. AMP was administered for >24 h in 69 and 64% of the GS patients. The most significant risk factors for SSI after GS were total parenteral nutrition, transfusion, and a drainage catheter. The most common pathogen was Escherichia coli, but all the isolated pathogens were multiresistant. CONCLUSION: AMP is effective for reducing the risk of SSI; however, the prolonged use of AMP and broad-spectrum antibiotics may be associated with the emergence of resistant bacterial strains.
