BACKGROUND: The acquirement of resistance by microorganisms to the antimicrobial arsenal is a threat to public health. A recent WHO report estimated that 1.3 million HIV-negative people and 0.38 million HIV-positive people died from TB in 2009. Various forms of cancer account for a high percentage of deaths in both women (breast cancer) and men (prostate cancer). RESULTS & DISCUSSION: In vitro activity assessment of newly constructed s-triazines against a panel of microorganisms including bacteria, fungi and Mycobacteria demonstrated that the compounds are of immense attraction for impending drug discovery. They were further examined for in vitro activity against breast cancer and prostate cancer cell lines, as well as HIV-1 (III(B)) and HIV-2 (ROD) viral strains. Proposed structural confirmation studies by IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, (19)F NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis were in accordance. CONCLUSION: Activity profiles of the products may contribute considerably to future drug-discovery studies.
