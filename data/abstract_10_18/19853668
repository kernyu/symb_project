Drug development in visceral leishmaniasis is extremely vital as the existing therapeutic modalities are plagued by the unwanted twosome of toxicity and drug resistance. Antineoplastic drugs have in the past been effective against the parasitic infections, for example, miltefosine. Cisplatin is a first-generation platinum-containing drug, used in the treatment of various solid tumors. Its in vitro antileishmanial effect has already been demonstrated. In the present study, the leishmanicidal potential of two doses (0.5mg/kg body weight and 1mg/kg body weight) of the drug was studied in BALB/c mice. The antileishmanial effect of the drug was revealed by significant reduction in the parasite burden. The infected and treated animals were also found to exhibit increased DTH responses. An initial transient and reversible increase in levels of SGOT, SGPT, BUN, blood urea, creatinine and phosphorus was observed in infected animals treated with both doses of the drug. The reduction in parasite load, increase in DTH response and various biochemical parameters were more pronounced in animals treated with 1mg/kg body weight of cisplatin as compared to those treated with 0.5mg/kg body weight of the drug. Though some histopathological changes were observed in the kidneys of animals treated with 1mg/kg body weight of cisplatin, no such change was observed in mice treated with the lower dose. Thus, we have for the first time characterized the in vivo effect of cisplatin in murine experimental visceral leishmaniasis.
