Infections due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa are increasing. The aim of our study was to evaluate the influences of appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy and multidrug resistance on mortality in patients with bacteremia due to P. aeruginosa (PAB). Episodes of PAB were prospectively registered from 2000 to 2008. MDR was considered when the strain was resistant to >/=3 antipseudomonal antibiotics. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. A total of 709 episodes of PAB were studied. MDR PAB (n = 127 [17.9%]) was more frequently nosocomial and associated with longer hospitalization, bladder catheter use, steroid and antibiotic therapy, receipt of inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy, and a higher mortality. Factors independently associated with mortality were age (odds ratio [OR], 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.002 to 1.033), shock (OR, 6.6; 95% CI, 4 to 10.8), cirrhosis (OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.4 to 7.6), intermediate-risk sources (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.4 to 4.3) or high-risk sources (OR, 7.3; 95% CI, 4.1 to 12.9), and inappropriate empirical therapy (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.3 to 3.5). To analyze the interaction between empirical therapy and MDR, a variable combining both was introduced in the multivariate analysis. Inappropriate therapy was significantly associated with higher mortality regardless of the susceptibility pattern, and there was a trend toward higher mortality in patients receiving appropriate therapy for MDR than in those appropriately treated for non-MDR strains (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 0.9 to 5.4). In 47.9% of MDR PAB episodes, appropriate therapy consisted of monotherapy with amikacin. In conclusion, MDR PAB is associated with a higher mortality than non-MDR PAB. This may be related to a higher rate of inappropriate empirical therapy and probably also to amikacin as frequently the only appropriate empirical therapy given to patients with MDR PAB.
