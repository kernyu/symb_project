This study focused on the development of flexible (i.e., deformable) multiple-unit pellets that feature (i) a prolonged drug release, (ii) drug abuse deterrence, and (iii) a minimal risk of alcohol-induced dose dumping (ADD). Deformable pellets were prepared via an advanced continuous one-step hot-melt extrusion (HME) technique, with the drug (i.e., antipyrine and codeine phosphate) fed as an aqueous solution into the molten matrix material (i.e., cornstarch, gum arabic, and xanthan). Formulations that had suitable mechanical characteristics (i.e., high compression strength) were coated with a flexible Aquacoat((R)) ARC film to ensure prolonged release and to avoid ADD. The pellets were characterized in terms of their mechanical properties and in vitro drug release behavior in alcoholic media. All formulations were abuse deterrent: they had a high compression strength and grinding the pellets into powder was impossible. Since the pellets comprising gum arabic and xanthan as a matrix did not remain intact during dissolution testing, they had a very fast drug release rate. Cornstarch-based pellets that swelled but remained intact in the dissolution media had a slower drug release. Coated cornstarch-based pellets had a prolonged release over 8 h and resistance to dose dumping in 20 and 40% ethanol. Our results indicate that cornstarch-based pellets manufactured via the advanced HME process followed by coating are a promising formulation that makes tampering difficult due to a high compression strength combined with robustness in alcoholic media.
