To reveal the antimicrobial susceptibilities of Escherichia coli isolates from wild mice, 81 E. coli isolates were obtained from 109 voles (Clethrionomys spp.), 52 large Japanese field mice (Apodemus speciosus) and 19 small Japanese field mice (A. argenteus) captured in a forest of a natural park in Hokkaido, Japan. Seventy-eight of the 81 E. coli isolates were susceptible to all 10 antimicrobial agents tested. One E. coli isolate was resistant to ampicillin, dihydrostreptomycin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol and oxytetracycline. Two isolates were resistant to oxytetracycline. A low prevalence of antimicrobial resistance was maintained among wild mice that inhabited the forest.
