BACKGROUND: B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia B (B-CLL), the most common type of leukemia, may be caused by apoptosis deficiency in the body. Adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) as providers of pro-apoptotic molecules such as tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), can be considered as an effective anti-cancer therapy candidate. Therefore, in this study we assessed the role of tumor necrosis factor-producing mesenchymal stem cells oin apoptosis of B-CLL cells resistant to fludarabine- based chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, after isolation and culture of AD-MSCs, a lentiviral LeGO-iG2-TRAIL-GFP vector containing a gene producing the ligand pro-apoptotic with plasmid PsPAX2 and PMDG2 virus were transfected into cell-lines to generate T293HEK. Then, T293HEK cell supernatant containing the virus produced after 48 and 72 hours was collected, and these viruses were transduced to reprogram AD-MSCs. Apoptosis rates were separately studied in four groups: group 1, AD-MSCs-TRAIL; group 2, AD-MSCs-GFP; group 3, AD-MSCs; and group 4, CLL. RESULTS: Observed apoptosis rates were: group 1, 42 +/- 1.04%; group 2, 21 +/- 0.57%; group 3, 19+/- 2.6%; and group 4, % 0.01 +/- 0.01. The highest rate of apoptosis thus occurred ingroup 1 (transduced TRAIL encoding vector). In this group, the average medium-soluble TRAIL was 72.7pg/m and flow cytometry analysis showed a pro-apoptosis rate of 63 +/- 1.6%, which was again higher than in other groups. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we have shown that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) secreted by AD-MSCs may play an effective role in inducing B-CLL cell apoptosis.
