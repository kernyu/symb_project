Prescribing errors may contribute to antibiotic resistance and other drug-related problems. To investigate the quality of prescriptions involving antibiotic prophylaxis by dentists in a large Brazilian city, 366 dental prescriptions were randomly selected from 31,105. A prophylaxis indication represented 24.9% of the prescriptions, and only 12 (13.2%; 95% confidence interval, 7.7%-21.7%) were correct regarding the generic name, dose, and length of antibiotic use. Prescriptions for antibiotic prophylaxis by dentists are mostly inadequate in this city.
