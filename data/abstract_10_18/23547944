BACKGROUND: blaVEB-1 is an integron-located extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene initially detected in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains from south-east Asia. Several recent studies have reported that VEB-1-positive strains are highly resistant to ceftazidime, cefotaxime and aztreonam antibiotics. One strategy to overcome resistance involves administering antibiotics together with beta-lactamase inhibitors during the treatment of infectious diseases. During this study, four VEB-1 beta-lactamase inhibitors were identified using computer-aided drug design. METHODS: The SWISS-MODEL tool was utilized to generate three dimensional structures of VEB-1 beta-lactamase, and the 3D model VEB-1 was verified using PROCHECK, ERRAT and VERIFY 3D programs. Virtual screening was performed by docking inhibitors obtained from the ZINC Database to the active site of the VEB-1 protein using AutoDock Vina software. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Homology modeling studies were performed to obtain a three-dimensional structure of VEB-1 beta-lactamase. The generated model was validated, and virtual screening of a large chemical ligand library with docking simulations was performed using AutoDock software with the ZINC database. On the basis of the dock-score, four molecules were subjected to ADME/TOX analysis, with ZINC4085364 emerging as the most potent inhibitor of the VEB-1 beta-lactamase.
