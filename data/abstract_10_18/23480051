AIM: To describe cases of confirmed central nervous system (CNS) tuberculosis seen at the major tertiary referral centre of North Queensland over a 10-year period. METHODS: This is a retrospective case series-based study of all cases of proven Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection of the CNS presenting to a major tertiary referral centre of North Queensland between 2000 and 2010. RESULTS: Five cases of confirmed CNS tuberculosis were identified over the 10-year period with two deaths. All were from Papua New Guinea with a mean age of 7 years. Imaging and early microbiological diagnosis was critical in making the diagnosis. HIV infection was not a contributing factor. Multidrug resistance was inferred or confirmed in two cases. CONCLUSIONS: CNS tuberculosis is a disease being increasingly seen in North Queensland among children from Papua New Guinea. Anticipation of multidrug resistance is important in the immediate management of suspected cases.
