The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of lapachol, alpha-lapachone, beta-lapachone and six antimicrobials (ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefoxitin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and meropenem) against twelve strains of Staphylococcus aureus from which resistance phenotypes were previously determined by the disk diffusion method. Five S. aureus strains (LFBM 01, LFBM 26, LFBM 28, LFBM 31 and LFBM 33) showed resistance to all antimicrobial agents tested and were selected for the study of the interaction between beta-lapachone and antimicrobial agents, busing checkerboard method. The criteria used to evaluate the synergistic activity were defined by the Fractional Inhibitory Concentration Index (FICI). Among the naphthoquinones, beta-lapachone was the most effective against S. aureus strains. FICI values ranged from 0.07 to 0.5, suggesting a synergistic interaction against multidrug resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains. An additive effect was observed with the combination beta-lapachone/ciprofloxacin against the LFBM 33 strain. The combination of beta-lapachone with cefoxitin showed no added benefit against LFBM 31 and LFBM 33 strains. This study demonstrated that, in general, beta-lapachone combined with beta lactams antimicrobials, fluoroquinolones and carbapenems acts synergistically inhibiting MRSA strains.
