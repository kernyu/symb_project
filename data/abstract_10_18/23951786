INTRODUCTION: C. albicans undergoes phenotypic switchng, a putative virulence trait assisting the organism to adapt to different environments. Although this switching has been studied among C. albicans isolates, not much is known about the process among various C. albicans clades (a group of genetic variants within a single species). AIM: To determine whether phenotypic switching among fluconazole resistant C. albicans isolates is clade-related. METHODS: Fifteen fluconazole resistant C. albicans isolates from different clades were studied. Phenotypic switching was determined by a method previously described. Switching behaviour and different colony morphologies among different clades were compared. RESULTS: Phenotypic switching was observed in all clades, with clade SA exhibiting the most switching (75%), and clade NG the east (5.6%). Stipple was the most dominant phenotype observed in all clades (p = 0.024), occurring mostly in clade SA (35%). Irregular wrinkle phenotype was dominant in clade SA (62%). CONCLUSION: Phenotypic switching was clade-related. Highest switching in clade SA isolates suggests better survival un der adverse conditions. Stipple and irregular wrinkle phenotypes among clade SA isolates need to be studied further.
