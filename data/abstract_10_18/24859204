There is an international epidemic of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among human immunodeficiency virus-infected men who have sex with men. Transmission of HCV variants that are resistant to recently approved direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) could be an important clinical and public health problem. We document a case of transmission of a DAA-resistant variant of HCV from a patient who was treated with telaprevir to his sexual partner. The transmission of HCV DAA-resistant variants could impair therapeutic regimens that include DAAs.
