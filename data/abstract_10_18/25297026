BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance is a growing problem in H. pylori treatment. The study was intended to evaluate the prevalence of resistance amongst 80 H.pylori isolates cultured from biopsy taken during routine endoscopies in 2008-2011. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 855 gastro duodenal biopsies were collected and cultured on H.pylori selective medium (containing Brucella agar and Columbia agar (Hi media), with Skirrow's supplement (antibiotic supplement) and 7% human blood cells). H.pylori was isolated from 80 specimens. The antimicrobial susceptibility of H.pylori isolates was carried out by the Kirby Bauer technique against metronidazole (5 microg), clarithromycin (15 microg), ciprofloxacin (5 microg), amoxicillin (10 microg), tetracycline (30 microg), erythromycin (15 microg), levofloxacin (5 microg), and furazolidone (50 microg) (Sigma- Aldrich, MO). RESULTS: 83.8% isolates were resistant to metronidazole, 58.8% were resistant to Clarithromycin 72.5% were resistant to Amoxicillin, 50% to Ciprofloxacin and 53.8% to tetracycline. furazolidone, erythromycin and Levofloxacin showed only 13.8% resistance to H.pylori. Multi drug resistance with metronidazole+clarithromycin+tetracycline was 85%. For all the drugs Antimicrobial resistance rate was found higher in males compare to females. Metronidazole and amoxicillin resistance was found noteworthy in patients with duodenal ulcer (p=0.018), gastritis (P=0.00), and in reflux esophagitis (P=0.00). clarithromycin and tetracycline resistance was suggestively linked with duodenitis (P=0.018), while furazolidone, erythromycin and levofloxacin showed excellent sensitivity in patients with duodenitis (P value--0.018), gastritis (P=0.00) and reflux esophagitis (P=0.00). Resistance with metronidazole (P=0.481), clarithromycin (P=0.261), amoxicillin (P=0.276), tetracycline (P=0.356), ciprofloxacin (P=0.164) was not correlated well with Age-group and Gender of the patients. CONCLUSION: A very high percentage of patients were infected with metronidazole and clarithromycin resistant strains. The use of antibiotics for other indications seems to be the major risk factor for the development of primary resistance. High incidence should alarm the gastroenterologist while prescribing the eradication regimen.
