INTRODUCTION: During the last two decades an increased incidence of infections caused by multiresistant bacteria has been observed. The spread of these microorganisms in the hospital is a major therapeutic and epidemiological problem. The aim of this study was to determine local resistance patterns of microorganisms causative of multirresistant infections in patients admitted to our hospital. METHODS: A retrospective study was designed, including Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii strains isolated from clinical and surveillance samples of patients admitted to the Hospital General La Mancha Centro, between June 2009 and May 2010. RESULTS: The rate of S. aureus isolates resistant to oxacillin was 50%, with 0% resistance to vancomycin. The percentage of resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins in E. coli and K. pneumoniae was 17 and 19%, respectively; the ESBL-production in enterobacterial strains was 15 and 19%, respectively, and the quinolone resistance was 41 and 28%, respectively. The resistance of P. aeruginosa to ceftazidime and imipenem was 30 and 40%, respectively. Most strains of A. baumannii studied came from a single multidrug-resistant clone, endemic in the ICU of our hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Of particular concern is the high rate of MRSA, E. coli and K. pneumoniae ESBL producers and resistant to fluoroquinolones as well as P. aeruginosa multiresistant. A. baumannii isolates belong mainly to endemic multidrug-resistant clone from the ICU.
