We identified strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae in San Diego County, California, that possess high levels of resistance to azithromycin (8.0-16.0 mug/ml MIC). These isolates contain a combination of mutations in both the 23S rRNA loci and mtrR genes. This is the first description of such isolates in the United States.
