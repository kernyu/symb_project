AIM: Study the prevalence and mechanisms of resistance in circulating C. diphtheriae strains. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 664 C. diphtheriae strains isolated in 1987 - 2013 in various regions of Russia and sent to the reference center of Gabrichevsky Moscow Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology were the object of the study. Antibiotic sensitivity of the strains was studied by disk-diffusion and E-test methods using 10 antimicrobial preparations. Nucleotide sequence analysis was carried out by using BLAST program and EMBL/GenBank database. RESULTS: Most of the studied strains turned out to be sensitive to all the antibacterial preparations used. 1.2% of C. diphtheriae strains turned out to be resistant to penicillin and 6.0% had intermediate level of resistance. 0.4 - 0.6% of the strains had intermediate level of resistance to macrolides, and 4.0 - 4.4% were resistant. 2.0% of the strains had multiple resistance. Erm(X)-specific PCR carried out in this study showed that all the C. diphtheriae strains resistant to macrolide antibiotics carry erm(X) gene. CONCLUSION: The results of the study indicate a fairly high level of prevalence for C. diphtheriae strains resistant to antibiotics.
