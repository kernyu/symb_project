Human infections caused by avian influenza A virus type subtype H7N9 have been associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Emergence of virus variants carrying markers of decreased susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors was reported. Here we show that DAS181 (Fludase), an antiviral drug with sialidase activity, potently inhibited replication of wild-type influenza A(H7N9) and its oseltamivir-resistant R292K variants in mice. A once-daily administration initiated early after lethal infection hampered body weight loss and completely protected mice from lethality. We observed a time-dependent effect for 24-72-hour delayed DAS181 treatments on morbidity and mortality. The results warrant further investigation of DAS181 for influenza treatment.
