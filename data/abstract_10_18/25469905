Eighty-four multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (MDR-KP) isolates from a Chinese hospital from January to October 2012 were evaluated to characterize the coexistence of 16S rRNA methylase, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, carbapenemase, and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants and their association with mobile genetic elements. Among the 84 MDR-KP isolates studied, 19 isolates exhibited high-level resistance to amikacin mediated by the production of the 16S rRNA methylase. They carried 19 armA genes (22.9%) and three rmtB genes (3.6%). CTX-M genes were found in all of the isolates. Among these armA- or rmtB/CTX-M-producing K. pneumoniae isolates, 31.6% carried the carbapenemase genes (blaKPC-2 [26.3%], blaIMP-4 [10.5%], and blaNDM-1 [5.3%]), which made them resistant to imipenem (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] >/=16 mg/L). All positive strains possessed qnr-like genes (16 qnrA1, 10 qnrS1, and 7 qnrB4 genes) and 18 harbored an aac(6')-Ib-cr gene. Mobile elements ISEcp1, IS26, ISCR1, ISAba125, and sul-1 integrons were detected in 19/19 (100%), 16/19 (84.2%), 18/19 (94.7%), 9/19 (47.4%), and 18/19 (94.7%) isolates, respectively. The mobilizing elements occurred in different combinations in the study isolates. Majority of armA and qnr genes were in MDR-KP strains carrying integrons containing the ISCR1. Close to 80% of blaTEM-1 and blaSHV-12 were linked to IS26 while >/=90% of blaCTX-Ms and blaCMYs were linked to ISEcp1. ISAba125 was located upstream of blaNDM-1 and some blaCMY-2 genes. In addition, seven transconjugants were available for further analysis, and armA, qnrS1, acc(6')-Ib-cr, blaCTX-M-15, blaTEM-1, and blaNDM-1 were cotransferred. This study points to the dissemination of 16S rRNA methylase genes and the prevalence of selected elements implicated in evolution of resistance determinants in collection of clinical K. pneumoniae in China.
