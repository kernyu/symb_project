Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative bacterium which emerged as a significant nosocomial pathogen worldwide. To investigate the molecular basis of the tigecycline-resistant mechanism, we determined the genome sequences of two multidrug-resistant A. baumannii strains isolated from a patient before and after treatment with tigecycline.
