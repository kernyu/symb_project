Genetically distinct isolates of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM)-producing Enterobacteriaceae were identified from the clinical cultures of 6 patients. Screening of shared-ward contacts identified 2 additional NDM-positive patients. Phylogenetic analysis proved that 1 contact was a direct transmission while the other was unrelated to the index, suggesting hidden routes of transmission.
