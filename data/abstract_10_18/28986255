Mitochondrially-derived oxidative stress has been implicated in the development of obesity-induced insulin resistance and is correlated with down regulation of Peroxiredoxin-3 (Prdx3). Prdx3 knockout mice exhibit whole-body insulin resistance, while Prdx3 transgenic animals remain insulin sensitive when placed on a high fat diet. To define the molecular events linking mitochondrial oxidative stress to insulin action, Prdx3 was silenced in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Prdx3 KD) and the resultant cells evaluated for mitochondrial function, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress), mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR) and insulin signaling. Prdx3 KD cells exhibit a two-fold increase in H2O2, reduced insulin-stimulated glucose transport and attenuated S(473) phosphorylation of the mTORC2 substrate, Akt. Importantly, the decrease in glucose uptake can be rescued by pre-treatment with the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC). The changes in insulin sensitivity occur independently from activation of the ER stress or mtUPR pathways. Analysis of mTORC2, the complex responsible for phosphorylating Akt at S(473), reveals increased cysteine oxidation of Rictor in Prdx3 KD cells that can be rescued with NAC. Taken together, these data suggest mitochondrial dysfunction in adipocytes may attenuate insulin signaling via oxidation of the mammalian-target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2).
