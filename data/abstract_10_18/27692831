In this Letter we report on an efficient and short 2-3 steps synthesis of gamma-hydroxy-gamma-lactam derived-tetramates bearing a 7-chloro-4-aminoquinoline skeleton and their evaluation as potent antimalarials. These molecules were obtained through ring opening-ring closure (RORC) process of gamma-ylidene-tetronate derivatives in the presence of 7-chloro-4-aminoquinoline-derived amines. In vitro antimalarial activity of these new gamma-lactams was evaluated against Plasmodium falciparum clones of variable sensitivity (3D7 and W2) and they were found to be active in the range of 14-827nM with generally good resistance index. A preliminary SAR study is also presented to explain these results. Finally, the most active compounds did not show in vitro cytotoxicity when tested against Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) up to concentration of 50muM and they were stable at pH 7.4 for at least 48h.
