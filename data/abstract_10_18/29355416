A novel silver nanoparticle (AgNP) formulation was developed as a targeted application for the disinfection of carious dentine. Silver nitrate (AgNO3) was chemically reduced using sodium borohydrate (NaBH4) in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to form micelle aggregate structures containing monodisperse 6.7- to 9.2-nm stabilized AgNPs. AgNPs were characterized by measurement of electrical conductivity and dynamic light scattering, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Antimicrobial activity of AgNPs was tested against planktonic cultures of representative gram-positive and gram-negative oral bacteria using well diffusion assays on tryptic soy broth media and monoculture biofilms grown with brain heart infusion +/- sucrose anaerobically at 37 degrees C on microtiter plates. Biofilm mass was measured by crystal violet assay. Effects were compared to silver diamine fluoride and chlorhexidine (negative controls) and 70% isopropanol (positive control) exposed cultures. In the presence of AgNPs, triplicate testing against Streptococcus gordonii DL1, C219, G102, and ATCC10558 strains; Streptococcus mutans UA159; Streptococcus mitis I18; and Enterococcus faecalis JH22 for planktonic bacteria, the minimum inhibitory concentrations were as low as 7.6 microg mL(-1) and the minimum bacteriocidal concentrations as low as 19.2 microg mL(-1) silver concentration. Microplate readings detecting crystal violet light absorption at 590 nm showed statistically significant differences between AgNP-exposed biofilms and where no antimicrobial agents were used. The presence of sucrose did not influence the sensitivity of any of the bacteria. By preventing in vitro biofilm formation for several Streptococcus spp. and E. faecalis, this AgNP formulation demonstrates potential for clinical application inhibiting biofilms.
