Gonorrhea is the second most commonly reported bacterial sexually transmitted disease in the United States, with an estimated 820,000 new Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections occurring each year. Antimicrobial resistance limits treatment success, heightens the risk of complications, and may facilitate the transmission of sexually transmitted infections. Neisseria gonorrhoeae has developed resistance to the sulfonamides, the tetracyclines, and penicillin. Dual therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin remains the only recommended first-line regimen for the treatment of gonorrhea in the United States. Dual therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin should be administered together on the same day, preferably simultaneously, and under direct observation. Pregnant women who are infected with N gonorrhoeae should be treated with the recommended dual therapy. A test-of-cure is not needed for individuals diagnosed with uncomplicated urogenital or rectal gonorrhea who are treated with the recommended or alternative regimens. Repeat N gonorrhoeae infection is prevalent among patients who have been diagnosed with and treated for gonorrhea in the preceding several months. Most of these infections result from reinfection; therefore, clinicians should advise patients with gonorrhea to be retested 3 months after treatment. Pregnant women with antenatal gonococcal infection should be retested in the third trimester unless recently treated.
