Doping of graphene has emerged as a key strategy to improve the electrocatalytic performance of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Activated graphene co-doped with iodine and nitrogen atoms (NIG) was developed in this work using a facile scalable approach. The onset potential, current density, and four-electron reduction pathway of the newly developed catalyst were significantly improved. The charge-transfer resistance of co-doped NIG was found to be much lower than nitrogen-doped graphene (NG); furthermore, the stability of NIG and its resistance to methanol crossover were also improved. The synergistically enhanced ORR performance of NIG was found to be a result of a high strain and size advantage of the larger iodine atom clusters (compared to nitrogen), which facilitate the simultaneous enrichment of anode electrons and O2 and H2 O molecule transport at catalytic sites, inducing four-electron transfer in a single step. These results are promising for application in alkaline fuel cells.
