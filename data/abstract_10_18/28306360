INTRODUCTION: The combination of growing antimicrobial resistance with a dry pipeline has resulted in infections that can no longer be treated. Specific reasons have led to companies' exit from the antibacterial space, however recent incentives are spurring interest to reinvigorate the pipeline. Areas covered: This article summarizes the available information on the discovery, developmental, and regulatory challenges in antibacterial development that have led to disinterest in the space, as well as ongoing incentives such as public-private partnerships and streamlined pathways to mend these challenges and bring new antibiotics to patients in need. Expert commentary: Clinicians should not only understand the reasons for the decline in antibiotic development that have resulted in the dry pipeline, but also the ongoing initiatives in place to build an appropriate supply. Doing so will result in greater appreciation and prudent use of these life-saving drugs when they become available.
