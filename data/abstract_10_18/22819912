BACKGROUND/AIMS: The management of non-responders (NR) represents the most challenging of all aspects in the care of patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). The purpose of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of amantadine. METHODOLOGY: Fourty- three patients with CHC who did not respond to prior combination therapy [IFNalpha-2a plus ribavirin for 48 weeks] were enrolled into the study. The first group (n=21) was administered pegylated IFN-alpha2a (180 mcg/week) plus ribavirin (1000-1200 mg/day) and amantadine (200mg/day) for 48 weeks. After discontinuation of therapy, patients were followed-up for an additional 24 weeks. The second group (n=22) received only amantadine (200mg/day) daily for at least 24 weeks (mean 96 weeks) and starting from the 24th week, HCV-RNA was assessed every 12 weeks without discontinuation of therapy. RESULTS: Mean ALT levels before treatment were 115.30 units in the first and 107.73 units in the second group whereas they were 48.38 and 54.76 units, respectively, after the treatment (p<0.001 for both). Sustained viral response rate for the first group at the 72nd week was 52.3% (11/21) (p<0.025). Among patients receiving amantadine, 1 patient became HCV-RNA negative at the 24th and 3 patients at the 48th week (response rate at week 48 was 18.2%), 1 patient at the second year and 1 patient at the fourth year of the treatment (p=0.031). CONCLUSIONS: Amantadine has a potential anti-inflammatory activity that can be a safe alternative for NR-CHC subjects to combination therapy.
