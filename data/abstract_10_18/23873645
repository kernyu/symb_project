OBJECTIVES: There are today HIV-infected patients in therapeutic impasses because of highly multidrug-resistant (HMDR) viruses. We studied the distribution of resistance mutations at clonal level, and we analysed the therapeutic strategies used in such cases to achieve undetectable viraemia. METHODS: The HMDR profile was defined as a genotypic sensitivity score (GSS) </= 1.5 for etravirine and raltegravir with full resistance to darunavir. About 30 clones per gene and per patient were sequenced. Virtual phenotypes were determined. Efficacy of therapeutic strategies was evaluated by follow-up of viral loads, CD4 cell counts and trough concentrations of drugs. RESULTS: Among 1310 patients on treatment and with genotypic resistance testing, 25 (2%) were resistant to darunavir and 11 (0.8%) had an HMDR profile. Five-hundred clones could be analysed for four of them. HMDR profiles were harboured by the great majority of clones and all resistance mutations were located on the same strains for all genes. Despite this and a regimen with a GSS <2.0 in three patients, they achieved a viraemia <20 copies/mL. These results were obtained using different strategies: high doses of drugs; combination of antiretrovirals with full or intermediate susceptibility, such as tipranavir, etravirine or maraviroc; and use of alternative compounds, such as foscarnet or interferon. CONCLUSION: Patients with HMDR HIV were uncommon, but, in such cases, all resistance mutations were borne on the same majority strains. In this study, tipranavir was the only protease inhibitor with full or intermediate susceptibility. Despite very limited therapeutic options, an undetectable viraemia can be achieved by combining different strategies.
