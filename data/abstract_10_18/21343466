The geometric mean 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for Proveblue, a methylene blue complying with the European Pharmacopoeia, was more active on 23 P. falciparum strains than chloroquine, quinine, mefloquine, monodesethylamodiaquine, and lumefantrine. We did not find significant associations between the Proveblue IC50 and polymorphisms in the pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfmdr2, pfmrp, and pfnhe-1 genes or the copy numbers of the pfmdr1 and pfmdr2 genes, all of which are involved in antimalarial resistance.
