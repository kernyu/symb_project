This study was retrospectively carried out to compare the efficacy of echinocandins such as micafungin (MCFG) and caspofungin (CPFG) in the treatment of antibiotic-unresponsive febrile patients with hematologic malignancies. A total of 163 patients received either MCFG or CPFG. We evaluated the efficacy of echinocandin against fever decline in all patients. Fever decline, defined as a body temperature of less than 37.5 degrees C sustained for more than 48 h without scheduled antipyretic medication. Efficacy assessments showed that the incidence of fever decline was not significantly different between the MCFG and CPFG groups (P=0.599). The median number of days from the start of echinocandin administration to fever decline was 5 in both the MCFG and CPFG groups. Multivariate analysis showed that the use of anti-MRSA drugs (HR, 0.64; 95%CI, 0.45-0.90; P=0.011) and a change from echinocandins to voriconazole or liposomal-amphotericin B (HR, 0.50; 95%CI, 0.30-0.74; P<0.001) are significant risk factors for sustained fever. A significant difference (P=0.002) in incidence of fever decline was however associated with differences in the timing of anti-MRSA drug administration. The median number of days from the start of echinocandin administration to fever decline was 5 when administration of the anti-MRSA drug occurred "simultaneously or prior to echinocandin start" and 11 in the "next day or later of echinocandin start" group. In other words, starting anti-MRSA drug treatment after echinocandin treatment is a risk factor. In conclusion, MCFG and CPFG have similar efficacy as empirical antifungal agents in the treatment of antibioticunresponsive febrile patients with hematopoietic malignancies.
