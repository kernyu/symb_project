A 1.5 yr old male German shepherd dog was evaluated for recurrent intermittent episodes of fever and lethargy. Clinicopathologic abnormalities were suggestive of a discospondylitis at the seventh and eighth thoracic vertebrae. Blood and urine cultures yielded growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) that was resistant to all commonly used antibiotics. Extralabel antibiotic susceptibility testing demonstrated susceptibility of both blood and urine isolates to linezolid. The prescribed dose was extrapolated from pharmacokinetic (PK) studies and the isolate's plasma minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Linezolid was administered for 23 wk and resulted in successful resolution of bacteremia, bacteriuria, and discospondylitis. When justified, linezolid should be considered to treat methicillin-resistant infections.
