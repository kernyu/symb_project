The efficacy of a novel attenuated Edwardsiella ictaluri vaccine (B-50348) was determined in channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) by bath immersion and intraperitoneal (IP) injection. The vaccine was developed from a virulent strain of E. ictaluri (AL93-58) through selection for novobiocin resistance. When channel catfish (average weight 10 g) were IP injected with 4.2 x 10(6) colony-forming units (CFU) of the attenuated vaccine B-50348, no fish died. However, when the same age and size matched group of the catfish were IP injected with a lesser amount (2.4 x 10(6) CFU/fish) of modified live RE-33 vaccine or the AL93-58 virulent strain (2.5 x 10(6) CFU/fish) of E. ictaluri, 65% and 95% fish died, respectively. When channel catfish were challenged with AL93-58, relative percent survival values of vaccinated fish were all greater than 90% at 22, 32, and 63 days post B-50348 vaccination through intraperitoneal injection. By bath immersion, at 37 and 57 days post vaccination of B-50348, relative percent survival values were both 100% when fish were challenged by virulent E. ictaluri AL93-58. Our results suggest that B-50348 could be used as a novel safe and efficacious vaccine against ESC in channel catfish.
