OBJECTIVE: To improve evidence-based care in the management of tuberculosis, we retrospectively analyzed the bacterial types and drug sensitivity test results of mycobacteria in Guangzhou over the past twelve years (from July 1998 to March 2010). METHODS: Over these twelve years, a total of 14 095 mycobacterial strains isolated from different samples were subjected to type identification and drug sensitivity tests according to the Standard Protocols of Laboratory Diagnostics for Tuberculosis by the Chinese Antituberculosis Association. Chi-square test was performed for statistical analyses for comparisons between groups. RESULTS: Of 14 095 strains of mycobacteria isolated, 10 844 strains (76.84%) were MTB, and 3251 strains (23.16%) were non-tuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM). Compared with the result of the fourth national survey of tuberculosis epidemiology, which showed 11.1% of NTM, the one of our study was significantly different (chi(2) = 69.79, P < 0.001). Drug sensitivity tests of MTB showed tolerance rates of 28.99% (2729/9413), 21.75% (2047/9413), 17.45% (1643/9413) and 11.53% (1085/9413) against isoniazid, rifampin, streptomycin and ethambutol, respectively. CONCLUSION: An increasing trend was observed in MTB drug tolerance against streptomycin, rifampin and isoniazid, whereas more and more NTM strains were isolated in recent years. These findings are worthy of note for clinicians.
