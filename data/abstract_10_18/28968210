Due to an increase in the occurrence of multi drug resistant microorganisms a need for the development of alternative drugs comes in light. This alternative drug should be such that the microorganisms should not be able to develop resistance against them easily. Antimicrobial peptides are the most potential candidates to be developed as alternative drug. In the present study the three toxins ETA, ETB and PVL of Staphylococcus aureus were docked with four antimicrobial peptides, Ib-AMP1, JCPep7, Snakin2, Sesquin, derived from plants. The docking studies predict that Ib-AMP1 shows significant interactions with all these three toxins. Hence, further studies can be carried out for developing Ib-AMP1 as an alternative drug against the toxins of Staphylococcus aureus.
