INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of calcium hydroxide (CH) and antibiotic pastes, including a mixture of metronidazole and ciprofloxacin, with and without minocycline or cefaclor, on the dislocation resistance of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) to root dentin. METHODS: Eighty single-rooted human mandibular premolars were selected. The teeth were prepared by using the ProTaper system. The prepared teeth were then instrumented to a #6 Peeso reamer to obtain a standard internal diameter of 1.5 mm. The reamers were passed 1 mm beyond apex to simulate immature teeth. The specimens were then randomly divided into a control group (no intracanal medicament was used) and 4 experimental groups that were treated with an intracanal medicament: CH, double antibiotic paste (DAP) with metronidazole and ciprofloxacin, triple antibiotic paste (TAP) with minocycline, or TAP with cefaclor (n = 16). After 3 weeks, the medicaments were removed, and approximately 3 mm of MTA was placed in the coronal third of the canals. A push-out test was used to measure the dislocation resistance between the root dentin and MTA. Data were analyzed by using one-way analysis of variance and Tukey post hoc tests. RESULTS: The dislocation resistance values of the CH, TAP with minocycline, and TAP with cefaclor groups were similar to those of the control group (P > .05), whereas the DAP group had the lowest dislocation resistance when compared with the other groups (P < .05). Overall, there was a predominance of cohesive failures between root dentin and MTA. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that the application of DAP as an intracanal medicament reduced the dislocation resistance of MTA to root dentin.
