INTRODUCTION: Doripenem is a new carbapenem with broad spectrum antibacterial activity indicated for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and complicated urinary and intraabdominal infections. METHODS: Isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter and Enterobacteriaceae from patients with nosocomial pneumonia, bacteremia and complicated intraabdominal infections attended in 16 Spanish hospitals were included (October 2008-May 2009). Susceptibility to imipenem, meropenem and doripenem was studied with the Etest method, and the results were interpreted according to the EUCAST criteria. RESULTS: Considering all the isolates, doripenem (MIC(50) 0.12 mg/L) was 2- to 8-fold more active than meropenem (0.25 mg/L) and imipenem (1 mg/L). In relation to Enterobacteriaceae, the MIC(50) and MIC(90) values of doripenem and meropenem were similar (0.03 and 0.12 mg/L, respectively) and clearly superior to those of imipenem (0.25 and 1 mg/L). In the case of P. aeruginosa, MIC(50) and MIC(90) were more favorable to doripenem (0.25 and 16 mg/L) than to meropenem (0.5 and >/=64 mg/L) or imipenem (2 and >/=64 mg/L). In this species, the percentage of strains with lower MIC values for doripenem among those exhibiting intermediate susceptibility and resistance to meropenem was 63.0% (29/46) and 61.7% (63/102), respectively, versus only 4.3% (2/46) and 1.9% (2/102) with higher MIC values for doripenem. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in this study are similar to those reported in other countries, and reinforce the superior in vitro activity of doripenem versus the other carbapenems and its position in the treatment guidelines regarding the nosocomial infections for which it is indicated.
