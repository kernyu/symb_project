BACKGROUND: The number of reported cases of resistance to tigecycline is increasing. The aim of this study was to evaluate the current standard tigecycline dosage regimen from a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) perspective. METHODS: Pharmacokinetic parameters and microbiological data were analyzed by Monte Carlo simulation in an evaluation of effectiveness. RESULTS: Tigecycline exhibits excellent in vitro antimicrobial activity, however the standard tigecycline dosing regimen fails to achieve the best outcome in vivo for the common drug-resistant strains, including Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter spp, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. This may result in a lack of response to tigecycline therapy or to a further increase in the resistance rate. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of new drugs on the horizon, rather than using a single fixed dosing regimen, tigecycline dosing needs to be optimized in order to achieve the desired successful clinical response and to prevent an escalation in drug resistance.
