The effects of liposomes containing phospholipid cardiolipin without antibiotic and loaded with levofloxacin on the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis with extensive drug resistance were studied in vitro. Liposomes consisting of cardiolipin alone in a concentration of 335 muM completely suppressed the growth of M. tuberculosis. In order to reduce the minimum inhibitory concentration of cardiolipin, complex liposome preparation consisting of phosphatidylcholin/cholesterol/cardiolipin and loaded with levofloxacin was prepared. Due to this, the cardiolipin concentration was reduced to 33.5 muM (50 mug/ml) and concentration of levofloxacin - to 2 mug/ml.
