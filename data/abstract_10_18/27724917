BACKGROUND: Infectious diseases due to multidrug-resistant bacteria are one of the causes of treatment failures contributing to an increase in mortality and/or morbidity. In this study, we evaluated the antibacterial potential of different parts of six medicinal plants namely Alstonia boonei, Ageratum conyzoides, Croton macrostachys, Cassia obtusifolia, Catharanthus roseus and Paullinia pinnata against a panel of 36 multi-drug resistant (MDR) Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. METHODS: Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimal Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) of the methanol extracts from different parts of the plants were determined using broth microdilution method; standard phytochemical methods were used for phytochemical screening. RESULTS: Several phytochemical classes such as polyphenols, sterols, triterpenes, alkaloids, flavonoids and saponins were identified in the plant extracts. MIC values obtained ranged from 64 to 1024 mug/mL. Leaves extract of Catharanthus roseus (86.11 %), Croton macrostachys (83.33 %) and Paullinia pinnata (80.55 %) displayed the best antibacterial spectra. The lowest MIC value of 64 mug/mL was obtained with the Paullinia pinnata stems extract and Cassia obtusifolia extract against the strain of Staphylococcus aureus MRSA8. Results also showed that the tested samples generally displayed bacteriostatic effects with MBC values obtained in only 3.35 % of the cases where plant extracts were active. CONCLUSION: The results obtained at the end of this study demonstrate for the first time the antibacterial activity of the studied medicinal plants against MDR bacteria. The tested plants could be a reservoir of molecules to fight against MDR bacterial infections.
