Pathogenic Vibrio alginolyticus, a cause of severe infection in shellfish, as well as in humans, has been found at high frequency around all coastal areas of Korea. The aim of this study was to determine the occurrence of V. alginolyticus, to identify the strains isolated from oysters in West Sea, and to investigate their antimicrobial resistance profiles. Biochemical analyses of the 90 initially recovered presumptive V. alginolyticus colonies indicated that 16 isolates were V. alginolyticus. PCR analysis to detect the presence of the gyrB gene confirmed that 15 (93.8 %) of the 16 isolates were V. alginolyticus. These 15 isolates had the following profiles of resistance against 16 antibiotics: all isolates were resistant to ampicillin and vancomycin, and 26.7 % of the isolates exhibited resistance to cephalothin. A large number of isolates showed intermediate resistance to erythromycin (100 %) and rifampin (73.3 %). Five (33.3 %) of the V. alginolyticus isolates demonstrated multiple resistance to at least three antimicrobials.
