Species distribution and antifungal susceptibility of Candida isolates at one institution were evaluated. Detection rates of fungi were examined for 5 years between 2007 and 2011. Sensitivities of fungi to amphotericin B, flucytosine, fluconazole, micafungin, itraconazole, and voriconazole were evaluated in blood culture-positive patients. A total of 3,832 fungal isolates were detected, including Candida albicans 66.5%, Candida glabrata 20.3%, Candida parapsilosis 6.2%, Candida tropicalis 5.5%, and others 1.5%. Candidemia was diagnosed in 131 patients, and C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, and others were present in 42.0%, 27.5%, 16.0%, 8.4%, and 6.1% of these patients, respectively. Voriconazole had the lowest MIC90s against C. albicans and C. parapsilosis (0.015 and 0.25). Micafungin had a low MIC90 against C. glabrata and C. tropicalis. C. albicans was the most common fungus in patients with candidemia. Voriconazole and micafungin were effective against C. albicans. Amphotericin B was effective for C. parapsilosis, and micafungin showed good efficacy against C. glabrata and C. tropicalis.
