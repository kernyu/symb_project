BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium abscessus group belongs to a group of rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) and, following Mycobacterium avium complex, is the second most common pathogen responsible for lung disease caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). Clarithromycin is known to be the key drug in the treatment of M. abscessus group disease, but a high failure rate of treatment response is reported due to clarithromycin inducible resistance. METHODS: Using the results from a clarithromycin susceptibility test we examined the proportion of clarithromycin inducible resistant M. abscessus (sensu stricto; hereafter referred to as M. abscessus) clinical strains. Also, we attempted to detect the clarithromycin resistant strains, using the amplification refractory mutation system-PCR (ARMS-PCR) and real-time PCR methods for rapid detection of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at position 28 (T or C) of the erm(41) gene of M. abscessus leading to resistance to clarithromycin. RESULTS: Of the 157 M. abscessus clinical strains, clarithromycin susceptible, resistant, and inducible resistant strains accounted for 10.83% (n = 17), 22.29% (n = 35), and 66.88% (n = 105), respectively. Clarithromycin resistant strains were able to separate from clarithromycin susceptible strains by ARMS-PCR and real-time PCR identical to DNA sequence analysis. CONCLUSION: Most M. abscessus clinical strains in Korea are resistant to clarithromycin, and ARMS-PCR and real-time PCR are useful tools for the rapid detection of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at position 28 of the erm(41) gene.
