OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of mycoplasma and chlamydia infections on tubal infertilityand to assess the antibiotic susceptibility and resistance of female urogenital, and consequently to guide clinical rational drug use. METHODS: 327 tubal infertility women as infertility group and 286 healthy pregnant women as control group were randomly selected, detected chlamydia trachomatis (CT), ureaplasma urealyticum (UU) and mycoplasma hominis (MH) in cervical secretions and drug resistance of UU and MH. RESULTS: CT infection rates (14.99%), UU infection rates (23.24%), UU + MH infection rates (29.05%),CT + UU + MH infection rates (9.17%) and total infection rates (88.99%) in infertility group is higher than those (order: 2.80%, 6.99%, 8.39%, 4.55%, 29.02%) in the control group, comparisons of two groups are statistically significant differences (P < 0.05), the susceptibility of UU to roxithromycin (sensitivity is 96.05%), josamycin (sensitivity is 96.05%), tetracycline (sensitivity is 82.89%), vibramycin( sensitivity is 92.11%) and clarithromycin (sensitivity is 96.05%) were relatively high and low to ciprofloxacin and acetyl spiramycin. The susceptibility of MH to josamycin (sensitivity is 95.83%), vibramycin (sensitivity is 91.67%), minocin (sensitivity is 83.33%) and actinospectacin (sensitivity is 75.00%) were relatively high and low to erythromycin, azithromycin, roxithromycin and clarithromycin. UU + MH was only sensitive to josamycin (sensitivity is 90.52%), high resistance (77.89% -91.58%) to erythromycin, azithromycin, acetyl spiramycin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, azithromycin and clarithromycin. CONCLUSION: Infection of CT, UU, MH and tubal infertility have certain relevance,the rates of CT, UU and MH infection in tubal infertility patients higher than fertile people. For many commonantibacterial drugs, UU, MH and UU + MH has strong resistance, the etiology detection and using adapted antibios should be taken seriously in clinical treatment.
