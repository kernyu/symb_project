The patent application WO2013112548 claims a new class of peptidomimetics - gamma-AApeptides with potent and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. These gamma-AApeptides are active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including medicinally relevant drug-resistant pathogens. They are believed to exert bactericidal function by mimicking the membrane disruption mechanism of host-defense peptides. As such, they may provide an alternative approach for antimicrobial development combating antibiotic resistance.
