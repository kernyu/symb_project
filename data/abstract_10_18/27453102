OBJECTIVE: To analyze the drug-resistance of clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains isolated from the tuberculosis(TB)patients in six provinces in China and related risk factors, and provide evidences for the effective prevention and treatment of drug resistant TB. METHODS: Six provinces were selected from China. The background information of the TB patients was investigated with questionnaire survey, and the drug susceptibilities of the clinical M. tuberculosis strains to isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol and streptomycin were tested by means of the proportional drug susceptibility test. Then the results and related risk factors were analyzed with software SPSS 20.0. RESULTS: The overall drug resistant rate and multi drug-resistant(MDR)rate were 23.42% and 13.51% respectively. The overall drug resistant rate and MDR rate in Beijing, Jilin, Hunan, Henan, Shaanxi, Xinjiang were 21.50%, 12.24%, 36.27%, 42.86%, 27.78%, 24.39% and 4.67%, 8.16%, 24.51%, 26.53%, 15.28%, 14.15%, respectively. The chi(2) analysis results showed that the differences in single drug-resistant rate, overall drug resistant rate and MDR rate in these provinces had significant differences(P=0.000). The univariate statistical analysis results showed that the retreatment for TB and TB treatment history were the risk factors associated with drug resistance(P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The drug resistance of TB was very serious in China, but the TB drug resistance varied with province. The preventive intervention should be strengthened against all the major risk factors associated with the drug resistance for the better prevention and control of TB.
