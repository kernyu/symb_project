The aim of this work was to investigate the mechanism responsible for multidrug resistance in ST11 Klebsiella pneumoniae YMC 2013/7/B3993 containing multiple copies of ESBL genes using multiple parallel sequencing technology. In-depth analysis of the strain revealed multiple copies of ESBL genes, 2 copies of blaSHV-12 and 1 copy of blaCTX-M-15. Furthermore, 1 copy of blaOXA-9 and 3 copies of blaTEM-1 were found. The insertion of Tn1331 was detected, which consisted of blaOXA-9, blaTEM-1, aac(6')-lb-cr, and aadA1 genes. The acquisition of multiple copies of resistance genes was due to the insertion of transposons in the bacterial genome and plasmid. The genotypic analysis revealed that the isolates belonging to ST11 showed severe resistance phenotypes and greater dissemination potential. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating multiple copies of same ESBL genes in K. pneumoniae ST11 isolate. Furthermore, massive parallel sequencing studies of genetic factors to enhance the fitness of this type strain would be warranted to determine whether ST11 K. pneumoniae can spread the KPC-type gene.
