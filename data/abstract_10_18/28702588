l-Lysines were conjugated to lipidated biphenyls using simple synthetic chemistry to obtain selective membrane-active antibacterial agents that inhibit cell-wall biosynthesis. The most selective compound bore promising activity against biofilm-related infections and intracellular bacteria, and also suppressed the stimulation of TNF-alpha induced by lipoteichoic acid. Belligerent to resistance development, it was active in a murine model of MRSA infection.
