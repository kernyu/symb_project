Enterobacterial strains resistant to polymyxins are being increasingly reported worldwide. The conventional methods for detection of colistin-resistant isolates such as broth microdilution remain time-consuming (24 to 48 h), and methods such as disc diffusion and Etest are not reliable. Recently, the rapid polymyxin NP test was developed for rapid identification of polymyxin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae This test is based on the detection of glucose metabolism related to bacterial growth in the presence of a defined concentration of colistin (or polymyxin B). The formation of acid metabolites is evidenced by a color change of a pH indicator (red phenol) in less than 2 h. In this study, the polymyxin NP test was evaluated for detection of colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae directly from blood cultures. The test was performed with 73 blood culture sets (either spiked or clinical blood cultures) with various enterobacterial species. The test exhibited excellent discrimination between polymyxin-resistant and polymyxin-susceptible enterobacterial isolates, and results are obtained from blood cultures within 4 h. It is easy to perform and requires neither subculture nor a centrifugation step. This test is rapid, specific, and sensitive and allows early identification of polymyxin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae directly from blood cultures.
