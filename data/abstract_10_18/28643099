BACKGROUND: The key elements in the therapy of surgical site infections (SSI) are surgical debridement and local and systemic antibiotic therapy; however, due to increasing antibiotic resistance, the development of additional therapeutic measures is of great interest for future trauma and orthopedic surgery. METHOD: Against the background of our own experimental and clinical experiences and on the basis of the current literature, possible future anti-infective strategies were elaborated. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Bacteriophages were discovered and clinically implemented approximately one century ago and have been used in Western Europe for about one decade. They are currently used mainly in patients with burn injuries. It is likely that bacteriophages will become of great importance in view of the increasing antibiotic multi-drug resistance; however, they will probably not entirely replace antibiotic drugs. A combined use of bacteriophages and antibiotics is likely to be a more reasonable efficient therapy. In addition, the clinical importance of antimicrobial peptides (AMP) also increases. Up to now the possible use of AMPs is still experimental; however, individual AMPs are already established in the routine therapy (e. g. colistin). Further diagnostic and therapeutic measures may include photodynamic therapy, ultraviolet (UV) light application and differentiated genome analysis as well as the individual metabolism situation (metabolomics) of the pathogen cell and the patient tissue.
