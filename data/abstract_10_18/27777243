Background: Antimicrobial resistance in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) poses a risk to elderly residents. The aim of this observational study was to investigate recent patterns of antimicrobial susceptibility in urine samples submitted to the Microbiology Laboratory at Cork University Hospital (CUH) from LTCFs in the greater Cork region. The antimicrobial susceptibilities of LTCF and General Practitioner (GP) urine samples sent to CUH, for patients aged over 65 years of age, were compared. Methods: A retrospective analysis of the antimicrobial susceptibilities of urine samples submitted to the microbiology laboratory at CUH in quarter one of 2011-2014 was conducted. LTCF and GP urine sample susceptibilities, for patients over 65 years of age, were compared using Chi square statistics. Results: Overall, the LTCF urine samples were less susceptible than GP urine samples to the antimicrobials recommended in the national urinary tract infection guidelines; trimethoprim, nitrofurantoin, cephalexin, co-amoxiclav, ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin ( P < 0.001). Important trends in antimicrobial susceptibility over the time period were noted. A significant reduction in susceptibility to co-amoxiclav was found between Q1 2011 and Q1 2014 in both settings (GP P = 0.013, LTCF P = 0.005). This study provides important information which will contribute to the revision of antimicrobial prescribing guidelines in the future. Conclusion: This study highlights the need for continuous surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility trends in LTCFs. Antimicrobial stewardship strategies are urgently required to address antimicrobial resistance and appropriate antimicrobial prescribing in the LTCF setting.
