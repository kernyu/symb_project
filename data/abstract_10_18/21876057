bla(SIM-1) and bla(OXA-23) were codetected in clinical carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baylyi strain NB09A30. Both of carbapenemase genes were located on a large plasmid (ca. 360 kb). bla(SIM-1) was found as a gene cassette inserted into a class 1 integron identical to that determined in Acinetobacter sp. isolates from South Korea. The genetic structure of bla(OXA-23) in NB09A30 was different from that in the prevalent Acinetobacter baumannii of clonal complex 92 (CC92) from the same hospital.
