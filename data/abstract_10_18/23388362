OBJECTIVE: To assess how healthcare professionals caring for patients in intensive care units (ICUs) understand and use antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) for multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli (MDR-GNB). DESIGN: A knowledge, attitude, and practice survey assessed ICU clinicians' knowledge of antimicrobial resistance, confidence interpreting AST results, and beliefs regarding the impact of AST on patient outcomes. SETTING: Sixteen ICUs affiliated with NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Attending physicians and subspecialty residents with primary clinical responsibilities in adult or pediatric ICUs as well as infectious diseases subspecialists and clinical pharmacists. METHODS: Participants completed an anonymous electronic survey. Responses included 4-level Likert scales dichotomized for analysis. Multivariate analyses were performed using generalized estimating equation logistic regression to account for correlation of respondents from the same ICU. RESULTS: The response rate was 51% (178 of 349 eligible participants); of the respondents, 120 (67%) were ICU physicians. Those caring for adult patients were more knowledgeable about antimicrobial activity and were more familiar with MDR-GNB infections. Only 33% and 12% of ICU physicians were familiar with standardized and specialized AST methods, respectively, but more than 95% believed that AST improved patient outcomes. After adjustment for demographic and healthcare provider characteristics, those familiar with treatment of MDR-GNB bloodstream infections, those aware of resistance mechanisms, and those aware of AST methods were more confident that they could interpret AST results and/or request additional in vitro testing. CONCLUSIONS: Our study uncovered knowledge gaps and educational needs that could serve as the foundation for future interventions. Familiarity with MDR-GNB increased overall knowledge, and familiarity with AST increased confidence interpreting the results.
