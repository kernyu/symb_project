OBJECTIVES: It is unknown if vancomycin minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) have increased in coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) or whether vancomycin remains appropriate empiric therapy. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study at a single tertiary care center over 8 years. Adult inpatients with >/=2 positive blood cultures for CoNS within a 48-h period were eligible. Susceptibilities were performed by automated broth based-microdilution. Changes in antimicrobial susceptibility were analyzed using logistic regression. The clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with bloodstream infections (BSI) were compared by MIC. RESULTS: Of 308 episodes of possible CoNS bacteremia, the vancomycin MIC was </=1 mug/mL in 80 (26%) isolates, 2 mug/mL in 223 (72.4%) isolates and 4 mug/mL in 5 (1.6%) isolates. No isolates were resistant. We observed an 11-fold increased chance of having an isolate with a vancomycin MIC </=1 mug/mL in 2009-2011 compared with 2004-2008 (OR 10.8, 95% CI 6.0-19.5, p < 0.05). In 152 patients with BSI, the median days of bacteremia, hospital mortality and readmissions at 30 days were similar in BSI caused by isolates with high vancomycin MICs (2-4 mug/mL) and low vancomycin MICs (</=1 mug/mL). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude vancomycin is still appropriate empiric therapy for CoNS BSIs. CoNS vancomycin MICs decreased over the study period despite widespread use of vancomycin.
