Imidazole, a five-membered heterocycle having three carbon atoms, and two double bonds, having efficient antibacterial Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtili, Bacillus proteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Helicobacter pyloriurease etc, shows a broad-spectrum of antibacterial activities. To Search new antibacterial drugs to overcome resistance of microorganisms to antibiotics, to date hundreds of this sort of derivatives have been synthesized and possess potent antibacterial activity. As the structure of imidazole derivatives is various, the target of antibacterial is also diverse including beta-Lactamases, beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase III (FabH), DNA gyrase and topoisomerase, glutamate racemase and urease. In this review, we will discuss the emergence of resistance to antibiotics and attempt to summarize the main developments of imidazole derivatives in the past ten years. We hope that increasing knowledge of the structure-activity relationship (SAR) will be beneficial to the rational design of new generation of small molecule antibacterial drugs.
