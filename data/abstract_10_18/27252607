Mortality in burn patients is most often caused by infections, which are frequently bacterial. These patients are subject to loss of the cutaneous barrier, invasive devices and immunosuppression which are all contributing factors to the onset of infections. Unfortunately, it is not easy to distinguish general signs of infection from other symptoms associated with burn injuries, making diagnosis difficult. Since infection is a great threat in burns patients, its prevention is a fundamental part of the treatment process. Moreover, due to the anomalous pharmacokinetic characteristics of burns patients, it is also mandatory to adapt any antimicrobial regimen to the outcomes of regular patient blood tests and sampling. At a time when bacterial resistance is becoming an increasing concern, research on alternative treatment (e.g. inhibitors of virulence factors, antimicrobial peptides, polyphenols, immunotherap, and so on) is crucial. One of the more promising possibilities in this area seems to be phagotherapy.
