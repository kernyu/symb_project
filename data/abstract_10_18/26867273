Pseudomonas spp. and Klebsiella pneumoniae are common causes of serious health care associated infections (HCAIs) worldwide. The treatment options for infections caused by multi-drug resistant (MDR) organisms are limited to tigecycline and carbapenems. A total of 172 isolates of multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas. spp and extended-spectrum beta- (ESBL) producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from clinical specimens at the Bugando Medical Centre were tested for their in vitro susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam 100/10mug using disc diffusion test as recommended by Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI). Out of 59 multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas spp, 54 (92.0%) were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam while of 113 ESBL producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, 55 (48.7%) were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam 100/10mug. Also, 20 (34.0%) of the Pseudomonas spp were both ESBL producers and susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam 100/10mug. A significant proportion of Pseudomonas spp isolates from clinical specimens in our setting are susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam. This study shows that piperacillin-tazobactam offer a better option to clinicians for the treatment of health care associated infections due to Pseudomonas spp. and ESBL producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in our setting and other health facilities where these organisms are of significance.
