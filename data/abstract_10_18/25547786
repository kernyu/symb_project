AIM: It is recommended that treatments that include clarithromycin should be avoided in eradication of Helicobacter pylori (HP) in cases where clarithromycin resistance is higher than 20%. We aimed to compare levofloxacin- and moxifloxacin-based triple therapies with standard treatment and with each other in eradication of helicobacter pylori as first-line therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized prospectively as three groups. There were 102 patients in the levofloxacin group, 101 patients in the moxifloxacin group, and 103 patients in the standard treatment group. The patients received levofloxacin 500 mg daily, amoxicillin 1 g b.i.d. and lansoprazole 30 mg b.i.d. for ten days (LAL) in the levofloxacin group; moxifloxacin 400 mg daily, amoxicillin 1 g b.i.d. and lansoprazole 30 mg b.i.d. (MAL) in the moxifloxacin group; and clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d., amoxicillin 1 g b.i.d. and lansoprazole 30 mg b.i.d. (CAL) in the standard treatment group. At post-treatment week 6, HP was checked by using stool antigen test. RESULTS: In the eradication of Helicobacter pylori, the success rate as determined by per protocol (PP) analysis was 92% in the LAL group, 91.8% in the MAL group, and 82.4% in the CAL group. A statistically significant difference was found in the LAL and MAL groups compared to the CAL group (p < 0.05). There was no difference between the LAL and MAL groups. CONCLUSIONS: It was determined that levofloxacin- and moxifloxacin-based triple therapies were more effective than the standard treatment in first-line setting in the eradication of Helicobacter pylori. In addition, no difference was found between levofloxacin- and moxifloxacin-based triple therapies. Currently observed high efficacy may be evaluated in treatment. Although quinolon resistance is not considered a major problem, it appears to be a factor that may reduce treatment success over a period of time.
