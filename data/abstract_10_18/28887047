Several frog skin peptides, first identified as result of their antimicrobial or immunomodulatory activities, have subsequently been shown to stimulate insulin release both in vitro and in vivo and so show potential for development into incretin-based drugs for treatment of patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, their therapeutic potential as anti-diabetic agents is not confined to this activity as certain frog skin-derived peptides, such as magainin-AM2 and CPF-SE1 and analogs of hymenochirin-1B, tigerinin-1R, and esculentin-2CHa, have been shown to increase insulin sensitivity, promote beta-cell proliferation, suppress pancreatic and circulating glucagon concentrations, improve the lipid profile, and selectively alter expression of genes involved in insulin secretion and action in mice with diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance. This review assesses the therapeutic possibilities of peptides from frogs belonging to the Pipidae, Dicroglossidae, and Ranidae families, focusing upon work that has been carried out since 2014.
