OBJECTIVES: To provide baseline data on patterns of antimicrobial usage in dogs and cats through the analysis of data stored in electronic practice management systems. METHODS: Clinical data from 11 first opinion veterinary practices were extracted for the year 2007. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed to assess the usage of antimicrobials. RESULTS: Widespread usage of systemic broad-spectrum antimicrobials was observed. Antimicrobials most frequently used in both species were potentiated amoxicillin (44.4% and 46.1% in cats and dogs, respectively) and amoxicillin (14.3% and 20.7%). Cephalexin (13.4%) and cefovecin (15.0%) were also commonly used in dogs and cats, respectively. Systemic critically important antimicrobials in human medicine were widely used in dogs (60.5%) and cats (82.7%). Topical antimicrobials used in both species included fusidic acid (48.4% and 54.8%), framycetin (20.4% and 13.4%), polymyxin B (12.6% and 9.3%) and neomycin (6.5% and 6.6%). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Inappropriate usage of broad-spectrum antimicrobials may contribute to the development of antimicrobial resistance and loss of efficacy of antimicrobials in veterinary settings. Data recorded in practice management systems were demonstrated to be a practical source for monitoring antimicrobial usage in pets.
