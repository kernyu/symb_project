BACKGROUND: Nucleoside/nucleotide analogues are widely used to treat chronic HBV infection, but drug resistance is common. The role of HBV surface gene variants in drug resistance to nucleoside/nucleotide analogues is unknown. We are trying to investigate the dynamics of S gene mutations and how they relate to a patient's virological response in this study. METHODS: Thirty patients with chronic hepatitis B were enrolled and serum samples were collected at multiple time points during treatment with telbivudine (LdT). The coding regions of the small surface antigen (S-HBsAg) were amplified and sequenced using the 454 GS FLX(+) System. RESULTS: Sequencing results revealed different dynamics of non-synonymous mutations, such as sL9P, sN40S, sG44E, sW172*, sW182* and sS187F, between patients with a complete virological response and those with a partial virological response. The viral population heterogeneity decreased at week 12 of LdT treatment in patients with a complete virological response, with a concomitant decline in non-synonymous mutations (from an average of 14 to 9.9 per sample) and an increase in the frequencies of major variants (from 14.3% to 40.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the decrease in viral population heterogeneity at an early stage of LdT treatment was associated with the subsequent optimal virological response, and the early appearance of some specific mutations, such as sG44E, sW172* and sW182*, is a potential indicator of a partial virological response in continuing therapy.
