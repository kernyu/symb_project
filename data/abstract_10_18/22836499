Reactive oxygen species (ROS) act as signaling molecules for regulating plant responses to abiotic and biotic stress and there exist source- and kind-specific pathways for ROS signaling. Recently, we created a novel system for producing H 2O 2 in Arabidopsis chloroplasts by chemical-dependent thylakoid membrane-bound ascorbate peroxidase (tAPX) silencing using an estrogen-inducible RNAi method. Microarray analysis revealed that the expression of a large set of genes was altered in response to tAPX silencing, some of which are known to be involved in pathogen response/resistance. Furthermore, we found that tAPX silencing enhances the levels of salicylic acid (SA) and the response to SA, a central regulator for biotic stress response. In this addendum, we describe the relationship between chloroplastic H 2O 2 and SA in stress response, and discuss the function of the kind- and source-specific ROS signaling in SA-mediated stress response.
