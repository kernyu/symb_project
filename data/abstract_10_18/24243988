OBJECTIVES: The safety of rifabutin replacing rifampicin among adults having rifampicin-related adverse reactions (ARs) during the treatment of tuberculosis remains unknown. METHODS: From June 2006 to June 2010, a total of 2868 newly treated tuberculosis patients without HIV infection in a referral hospital were screened in this retrospective cohort study. RESULTS: Among the screened patients, a total of 221 (8%) patients who received rifabutin replacing rifampicin were included. Of these patients, 158 (72%) tolerated rifabutin during treatment, but 47 (21%) and 16 (7%) experienced mild and severe rifabutin-related ARs (including neutropenia, severe hepatitis and uveitis), respectively, and needed to discontinue rifabutin. Those having previous rifampicin-related arthralgia, dermatological events and cholestasis had a higher AR recurrence rate (60%, 23% and 9%, respectively) than others (5% for hepatitis and gastrointestinal intolerance and 0% for flu-like syndrome, neutropenia and others; P < 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that females (OR 3.35; 95% CI 1.06-10.56; P = 0.04) and patients with hepatitis virus B (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection (OR 3.72; 95% CI 1.19-11.67; P = 0.02) were at a higher risk of rifabutin-related severe ARs. No development of new drug resistance and no relapse of tuberculosis were found during 2 years of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Rifabutin replacing rifampicin was well tolerated in most adults who had rifampicin-related ARs. Females and those with HCV or HBV coinfection were more prone to rifabutin-related severe ARs and required more cautious monitoring.
