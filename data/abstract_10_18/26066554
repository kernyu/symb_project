The incidence of fungal infection and evolution of multidrug resistance have increased the need for new antifungal agents. To gain further insight into the development of antifungal drugs, the phenotypic profiles of currently available antifungal agents of three classes-ergosterol, cell wall and nucleic acid biosynthesis inhibitors-were investigated using yeast morphology as a chemogenomic signature. The comparison of drug-induced morphological changes with the deletion of 4718 non-essential genes not only confirmed the mode of action of the drugs but also revealed an unexpected connection among ergosterol, vacuolar proton-transporting V-type ATPase and cell-wall-targeting drugs. To improve, simplify and accelerate drug development, we developed a systematic classifier that sorts a newly discovered compound into a class with a similar mode of action without any mutant information. Using well-characterized agents as target unknown compounds, this method successfully categorized these compounds into their respective classes. Based on our data, we suggest that morphological profiling can be used to develop novel antifungal drugs.
