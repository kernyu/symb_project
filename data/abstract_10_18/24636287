OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy profile of entecavir capsule (ETV) as a chronic hepatitis B therapy, as compared to lamivudine (LAM). METHODS: In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group evaluation of ETV, 232 subjects were administered a 96-week course of 0.5 mg/day ETV or 100 mg/day LAM. PCR measurement of hepatitis B virus (HBV) was conducted throughout the treatment course to determine achievement of complete virologic response (CVR; defined as less than 500 copies/ml of HBV DNA) or experience of virology rebound ( more than 500 copies/ml of HBV DNA after achievement of CVR). RESULTS: After week-48 of treatment, the ETV group showed a higher CVR rate (90.3% vs. LAM: 59.4%) and lower virology rebound rate (1.9% vs. LAM: 13.9%). After week-96 of treatment, the ETV group continued to have a higher CVR rate (86.0% vs. LAM: 71.4%), and virology rebound was experienced by significantly less subjects in the ETV group (1.2% vs. LAM: 11.9%, P = 0.005). CONCLUSION: ETV therapy can quickly and continuously suppress HBV replication in chronic hepatitis B patients, and has a lower resistance rate than LAM. Compared to LAM, ETV may be a superior long-term treatment choice for chronic hepatitis B.
