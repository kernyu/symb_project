Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is becoming a more and more common cause of infections. In this study, the minimal inhibitory concentrations of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT), ceftazidime, minocycline, levofloxacin, chloramphenicol and ticarcillin/clavulanic acid were determined and the distribution of integrons and sul1, sul2 and dfrA genes was investigated in 102 S. maltophilia isolates collected from patients treated in 31 hospitals in Anhui, China, in the month of September in 2006-2008. The rate of resistance to SXT was up to 30.4%, and 64.7% of isolates were class 1 integron-positive. Sequencing data revealed the following novel gene cassettes embedded in class 1 integrons: dfrA17-aadA5; dfrA12-aadA2; aacA4-catB8-aadA1; aadB-aac(6')-II-bla(CARB-8); and arr-3-aacA4. This is the first report of the gene cassettes dfrA17-aadA5 and dfrA12-aadA2 and of sul2 genes in SXT-resistant S. maltophilia isolates in China. None of the SXT-susceptible S. maltophilia isolates were positive for sul2 or dfrA gene products by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), but PCR products for sul1 were detected in 27 SXT-susceptible and 25 SXT-resistant isolates. The findings from this study indicate that the sul1 gene, in combination with dfrA17 and dfrA12 gene cassettes and sul2 genes located within a 7.3kb plasmid, lead to a high rate of SXT resistance and also confirm the need for ongoing resistance surveillance.
