Influenza virus infection causes endemics almost yearly and pandemics occasionally. Although antivirals are available for the clinical treatment of influenza virus infection, the emergence of a drug-resistant virus has reduced the effectiveness of therapy and prophylaxis. Therefore, the timely detection of drug-resistant influenza viruses is important. A single-tube reaction using peptide nucleic acid (PNA) as both a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) clamp and a sensor probe was established to detect the low numbers of copies of viral genes that carry the resistant marker. Influenza A H1N1 viruses resistant to a clinically used antiviral, amantadine, are selected for the experimental design. The PNA-mediated reverse transcription-PCR detected 10 copies/muL of RNA from the resistant strain among 2 x 10(4) copies/muL of RNA from the sensitive strain. A rapid and sensitive method was established for detecting low numbers of drug-resistant genes of the influenza virus. The assay would help to monitorthe emergence of adrug-resistant influenza virus.
