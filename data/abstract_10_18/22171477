A study of the antiherpesviral activity of acycloguanosine (ACG) H-phosphonate (ACG-P) on a model of fatal herpesvirus infection in inbred BALB/c albino mice has established that ACG-P reduces death rates in the animals, considerably increases their average lifespan, and significantly decreases brain virus titers with both 60% mortality in the control and 92% mortality in the control group. There was also a significant inhibition of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) replication in the brain tissue of animals receiving ACG-P on a model of ACG-resistant HSV-1/L2/RACG(TK-).
