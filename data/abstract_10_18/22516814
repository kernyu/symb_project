Vesicle fusion processes in plants are important for both development and stress responses. Transgenic potato plants with reduced expression of SYNTAXIN-RELATED1 (StSYR1), a gene encoding the potato homolog of Arabidopsis PENETRATION1 (AtPEN1), display spontaneous necrosis and chlorosis at later stages of development. In accordance with this developmental defect, tuber number, weight and overall yield are significantly reduced in StSYR1-RNAi lines. Enhanced resistance of StSYR1-RNAi plants to Phytophthora infestans, the causal agent of late blight disease of potato, correlates with enhanced levels of salicylic acid, whereas levels of 12-oxophytodienoic acid and jasmonic acid are unaltered. Cultured cells of StSYR1-RNAi lines secrete at least two compounds which are not detectable in the supernatant of control cells, suggesting an involvement of StSYR1 in secretion processes to the apoplast.
