BACKGROUND: Certain antiretrovirals are known to affect lipid and glucose homeostasis. The aim of this study was to assess the effect on insulin sensitivity (determined by peripheral glucose uptake using a hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp) of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) administration compared with placebo for 2 weeks in HIV-1-seronegative healthy male volunteers. Changes in lipids, adiponectin, leptin, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) and the adhesion molecules E-selectin and P-selectin were also assessed. METHODS: This was a single-centre, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study that used a two-sequence, two-period cross-over design. A total of 19 HIV-negative males were recruited to the study and randomized 1:1 to receive either 2 weeks of TDF (300 mg once daily) followed by 2 weeks of placebo or placebo initially followed by tenofovir. Clamps were performed at baseline, after 2 weeks and after 4 weeks. RESULTS: All three clamps were completed by 16 participants. During the euglycaemic clamp, there were no significant changes in insulin sensitivity after 2 weeks of TDF administration compared with placebo or baseline. There was a significant reduction in the mean total cholesterol (9.4%) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL; 8.1%) cholesterol following 2 weeks of TDF compared with placebo. Levels of adiponectin, leptin, PAI-1, P-selectin and E-selectin were not significantly altered. CONCLUSIONS: TDF use for 2 weeks does not affect insulin sensitivity, as assessed by the hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp in HIV-negative male volunteers. TDF use resulted in modest, but statistically significant, reductions in total and LDL cholesterol.
