INTRODUCTION: IFN-free regimens with direct antiviral agents (DAAs) against hepatitis C virus (HCV) are likely to greatly expand patients' access and response to hepatitis C therapy, while safety and tolerability of treatments seem substantially improved. Sofosbuvir (SOF), a NS5B nucleotide polymerase inhibitor with pan-genotypic activity and a high-barrier to resistance, has been approved by FDA and EMA in an all oral combination therapy for chronic hepatitis C with ribavirin (RBV) alone, or in combination with either pegylated interferon/RBV or other DAAs. AREAS COVERED: This paper provides an overview of SOF-based therapy in chronic hepatitis C as it emerges from the published clinical trials. Data on special populations are included (i.e., decompensated patients, patients on liver transplant waiting lists, patients with renal impairment). The data has been analyzed according to the different HCV-genotypes and comprehensively covers both safety and efficacy treatment profiles. EXPERT OPINION: Clinical trials have highlighted the safety and efficacy of SOF-based regimens, leading to the rapid approval of this therapy and its incorporation in the recommendations of the international societies on treatment of HCV infection. However, additional data are still needed to optimize both combination therapies' efficacy and duration in some categories of patients who have been under-represented in the registration trials.
