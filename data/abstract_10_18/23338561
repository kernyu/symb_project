In order to search for alternative agents to overcome chemoresistance during the treatment of ovarian cancer, this study aimed to examine the anticancer effects and action mechanism of salinomycin, a selective inhibitor of cancer stem cells, on cisplatin-resistant human ovarian cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo. The concentration- (0.01-200 microM) and timedependent (24-72 h) growth inhibitory effects of salinomycin were observed in the ovarian cancer cell lines OV2008, C13, A2780, A2780-cp, SKOV3 and OVCAR3, by measuring cell viability using the resazurin reduction assay. The IC50 (24 h) range of salinomycin on the six cell lines was found to be 1.7-7.4 microM. After cisplatin-resistant C13 cells were treated with salinomycin, the percentage of apoptotic cells determined by flow cytometry was significantly increased, in a concentration- and timedependent manner. However, no cell cycle arrest was detected in the G1/G0, S and G2/M phases in the salinomycintreated and control cells. The Bio-Plex phosphoprotein 5-plex assay (Akt, IkappaB-alpha, ERK1/2, JNK and p38 MAPK) demonstrated a marked time- and concentrationdependent increase in the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, subsequent to salinomycin treatment. Moreover, salinomycin significantly suppressed tumor growth in a tumor xenograft model. These findings suggested that salinomycin efficiently inhibits the cisplatin-resistant human ovarian cancer cell line growth through the induction of apoptosis, potentially associated with the p38 MAPK activation.
