UNLABELLED: Surgical site infection (SSI) is common in Vietnamese post-operative patients. It contributes to increased morbidity, mortality, hospitalization time and health care expenditure. Bacterial culture is considered the gold standard procedure to identify SSI pathogens and antibiotic resistant properties; however, it can detect microbes that can readily grow and is time-consuming. We propose optimized multiplex PCR assays to diagnose the most relevant microbes and associated genes encoding for acquired extended spectrum betalactamases (ESBL) or carbapenemases from Vietnamese patients with SSI in a hospital setting in Hanoi. METHODS: Ninety-one patients (n = 91) were collected in order to identify microbial pathogens and associated genes encoding for acquired extended spectrum betalactamases (ESBL) or carbapenemases by both conventional bacterial culture and in-house multiplex PCR assays. RESULT AND CONCLUSION: The novel in-house multiplex PCR assays are comparable to the bacterial culture approach in screening for common pathogens causing SSI and for relevant genotypes conferring betalactam/carbapenem resistance for bacteria. This is the first report of Turkey-specific ESBL gene (PER-1) and two Oxacilinase families (Oxa23 and Oxa 58) in Vietnam.
