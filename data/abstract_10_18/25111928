In units that bathe patients daily with chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG), organisms causing central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) were more likely to have reduced CHG susceptibility than organisms causing CLABSIs in units that do not bathe patients daily with CHG (86% vs 64%; P = .028). Surveillance is needed to detect reduced CHG susceptibility with widespread CHG use.
