We previously published a simple multiplex PCR assay for quick-screening of Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome mec (SCCmec) types I-V, which has been extensively used worldwide. An updated assay is described here and the changes serve to make this rapid assay more accurate and reliable in facilitating identification of most common and major SCCmec types.
