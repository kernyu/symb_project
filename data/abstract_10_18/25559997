PURPOSE: Linezolid is an effective drug against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). We describe the emergence of linezolid resistance in MRSA and VRE from India. MATERIAL AND METHODS: One MRSA and two VRE strains were isolated from a patient on linezolid therapy of one week duration. All three isolates were resistant to linezolid with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) >/=4 mg/L. The 746-bp region flanking the possible G2576U mutation on the corresponding DNA from the 23S rRNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and amplicons were sequenced for all the three isolates. Conjugation experiments using the linezolid resistant MRSA (LRMRSA) and linezolid resistant VRE (LRVRE) isolates as donors and wild strains of corresponding genera as recipients were performed. RESULTS: The MRSA isolate had the classical G2576U mutation. High quality value scores in the sequencing software validated the mutation. Conjugation studies did not indicate presence of transferable resistance for linezolid. Sequencing did not indicate presence of any mutation in the two LRVRE isolates. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report from India citing resistance in Staphylococcus and Enterococcus against Linezolid.
