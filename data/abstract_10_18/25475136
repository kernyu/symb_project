OBJECTIVE: To study the presence of bacterial biofilm on the sinus mucosa of healthy individuals (controls) and patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyposis. METHODS: An analytical, prospective and observational study was conducted. Tissue samples were obtained from the sinus mucosa. The bacteria were isolated and typified, and the material was examined for biofilm formation using tissue culture plate, Congo red agar detection and tube methods. RESULTS: A total of 100 cases were analysed for the presence of biofilm. Bacterial biofilm was present in 26 of 50 disease group cases (52 per cent) and in 4 of 50 control group cases (8 per cent) (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The presence of biofilm on the mucosa of chronic rhinosinusitis patients offers a possible cause for the persistent inflammation, and for antibiotics resistance and antimicrobial therapy failure. These findings could change the approach to treatment.
