AIM: Neonatal sepsis (NS) sustains high mortality and morbidity in China, but data on the epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance patterns of NS pathogens are limited. METHODS: The clinical features, aetiology and antimicrobial resistance of culture-proven NS were analysed over a period of 25 years in the metropolitan city of Chongqing in Southwest China. RESULTS: The occurrence rates of neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS) were found to gradually decrease while late-onset sepsis (LOS) was kept stable from 1990 to 2014. Although coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CoNS) sepsis accounted for most infections, the occurrence rates of CoNS sepsis gradually decreased, especially in EOS. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella were common Gram-negative bacteria. The occurrence rates of E. coli and Klebsiella remained stable in EOS; however, in LOS, those had increased mildly, especially from 2009 to 2014. Although a high-degree resistance to common first- and second-line antimicrobials was observed for the main causative pathogens of NS, the gentamicin-resistance rate declined gradually from the year 2003. Similarly, the ceftazidime-resistance rate of E. coli dropped gradually from the year 2007. CONCLUSIONS: The alarmingly high degree of antibiotic resistance calls for urgent evaluation and development of antibiotic policy and protocols for the treatment of NS. Clinicians should strictly control the antibiotics use, decrease invasive manipulations and shorten hospitalisation to prevent LOS.
