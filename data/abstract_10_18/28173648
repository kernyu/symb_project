Objective: To investigate the antibiotic resistance status of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from hospitalized children in Shanxi Children's Hospital. Method: E-test and Kirby-Bauer methods were applied to determine drug sensitivity of the isolates collected from the body fluid specimens of hospitalized children in Shanxi Children's Hospital from January 2012 to December 2014. The antimicrobial sensitivity and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Streptococcus pneumoniae to the conventional antibiotics were analyzed, in order to compare the annual trends of non-invasive isolates, while the differentiation of sensitivity from specimens. The comparison of rates was performed by Chi-squared test and Fisher's exact test. Result: A total of 671 isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae were obtained, which could be divided as non-invasive isolates(607), invasive isolates from non-cerebrospinal fluid(non-CSF)(40) and invasive isolates from cerebrospinal fluid(CSF)(24). The antimicrobial sensitivity(isolates(%)) of the 671 isolates were respectively vancomycin 671(100.0%), linezolid 671(100.0%), levofloxacin 665(99.1%), penicillin 595(88.7%), ceftriaxone 516(76.9%), cefotaxime 512(76.3%), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprin(SMZ-TMP) 103(15.4%), clindamycin 28(4.2%), tetracycline 26(3.9%), erythromycin 12(1.8%). From 2012 to 2014, the susceptibility rates of non-invasive isolates to penicillin every year were 95.0%(96/101), 97.3%(110/113), 87.3%(343/393), respectively, and there was significant difference among the three years(chi(2)=13.266, P<0.05), and the values of MIC(50, )MIC(90) and the maximum values of MIC(mg/L) of penicillin were 0.064, 2.000, 6.000 in 2012, which grew up to 1.000, 3.000, 16.000 in 2014. There was no significant difference in the susceptibility rate of non-invasive isolates to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime during these three years, (chi(2)=1.172, 1.198, both P>0.05). On the other hand, the values of MIC(50, )MIC(90) and the maximum value of MIC(mg/L) of ceftriaxone and cefotaxime both increased from 0.500, 2.000, 8.000 in 2012 to 0.750, 4.000, 32.000 in 2014. There was no significant difference in the susceptibility rate of non-invasive isolates to the rest antibiotic. Based on the same examining standard of CSF, the antimicrobial sensitivity(isolates(%)) of the non-invasive isolates to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, SMZ-TMP were respectively 281(46.3%), 278(45.8%), 78(12.9%), were significantly lower than the susceptibility rate of the invasive isolates from non-CSF (28(70%), 28(70%), 14(35%), chi(2)=8.453, 8.817, 15.094, all P<0.012 5), and lower than the invasive isolates from CSF (18(75%), 18(75%), chi(2)=7.631, 7.905, P<0.012 5; 11(45.8%), P=0.001). The sensitivity of the isolates to the rest antibiotics were similar(P>0.05). Conclusion: More than 95.0% strains of the streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from the hospitalized children in Shanxi Children's Hospital were sensitive to vancomycin, linezolid, levofloxacin, and the susceptibility rate of penicillin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime were 88.7%, 76.9%, 76.3%. However, less than 20.0% of streptococcus pneumoniae were sensitive to erythromycin, clindamycin, SMZ-TMP and tetracycline. The susceptibility rate of penicillin of non-invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae declined by these years, and the differences to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime can be neglected, but the values of MIC(50, )MIC(90) and the maximum value of MIC of all were linearly rising. The susceptibility rate of antibiotics to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime of the non-invasive isolates was lower than the invasive isolates.
