The commercial solid phase microextraction (SPME) fibers are not stable enough in organic solvent and tend to swell and strip off from the silica fiber in the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) mobile phase, and therefore the application of SPME coupled online with HPLC is limited. In this study, an SPME fiber coated with single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), prepared by means of electrophoretic deposition, was coupled on line to HPLC for the determination of four endocrine-disrupting compounds, i.e. bisphenol A (BPA), estrone (E(1)), 17alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE(2)) and octylphenol (OP), in aqueous samples. The results showed that the SWCNTs coating on the prepared fiber did not swell and strip off from the platinum fiber throughout the experiment, thus indicating a high resistance to the HPLC mobile phase, the mixture of water and acetonitrile. The SWCNTs fiber had similar (for OP) or higher (for BPA, EE(2) and E(1)) extraction efficiencies than the commonly used polyacrylate fiber, and had a lifetime of more than 120 operation times. Under the optimized conditions, the linearity of the proposed method was 1.0-30.0 mug/L for BPA and OP and 3.0-90.0 mug/L for E(1) and EE(2). The limits of detection (LODs; S/N=3) and limits of quantification (LOQs; S/N=10) of the method were 0.32-0.52 mug/L and 1.06-1.72 mug/L, respectively. Repeatability for one fiber (n=3) was in the range of 1.3-7.1% and fiber-to-fiber reproducibility (n=3) was in the range of 1.6-8.4%. The proposed method was successfully applied for the analysis of spiked tap water and seawater samples with recoveries from 81.8 to 97.3%.
