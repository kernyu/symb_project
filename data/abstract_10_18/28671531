An Acinetobacter strain, designated ACE, was isolated in the laboratory. Phylogenetic tests and average nucleotide identity value comparisons suggested that ACE belongs to the species Acinetobacterschindleri. We report for the first time the complete genome sequence of an A. schindleri strain, which consists of a single circular chromosome of 3 001 209 bp with an overall DNA G+C content of 42.9 mol% and six plasmids that account for 266 844 bp of extrachromosomal material. The presence or absence of genes related to carbon catabolism and antibiotic resistance were in agreement with the phenotypic characterization of ACE. This strain grew faster and with a higher biomass yield on acetate than the reference strain Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1. However, ACE did not use aromatic compounds and was unable to grow on common carbon sources, such as glucose, xylose, glycerol or citrate. The gluconeogenic and the catechol pathways are complete in ACE, but compounds that are converted to protocatechuate did not sustain growth since some genes of this pathway are missing. Likewise, this strain could not grow on glucose because it lacks the genes of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. Minimal inhibitory concentration data showed that ACE was susceptible to most of the antimicrobial agents recommended for the clinical treatment of Acinetobacter spp. Some genes related to a possible human-microbe interaction were found in the ACE genome. ACE is likely to have a low pathogenic risk, as is the case with other A. schindleri strains. These results provide a valuable reference for broadening the knowledge of the biology of Acinetobacter.
