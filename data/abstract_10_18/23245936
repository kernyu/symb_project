OBJECTIVES: An antibiotic stewardship program was implemented in our teaching hospital in 1999, and strengthened in 2005. We report its organization and impact on antibiotic use. METHODS: This observational study was conducted during a 10-year period (2002-2011). RESULTS: Many interventions were implemented: Infectious Diseases Specialists (IDS) led systematic ward rounds in several departments (1999); nominative antibiotic order form (2005); documentation of IDS advice in the patient's electronic medical record (2007); IDS advice triggered by the pharmacist (formulary restriction, 2007) or because of positive blood cultures (2009); automated weekly extraction of advice given into a database (2011). Seven thousand two hundred and five pieces of advice were recorded between 2007 and 2011: 63% following physician request, 26% triggered by the pharmacist and 9% because of positive blood cultures. Advice was provided by IDS in 95% of cases (63% by phone). The number of antibiotic prescriptions remained stable since 2005 at around 400 defined daily doses (DDD)/1000 patient-days. Documenting, sharing, and choice of action were improved due to the database. CONCLUSIONS: Our antibiotic stewardship program is well accepted by physicians and allows controlling antibiotic use in our hospital.
