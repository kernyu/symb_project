Cisplatin-based chemotherapy frequently resulted in acquired resistance. The underpinning mechanism of such resistance remains obscure especially in relation to autophagic response. This study thus investigated the role of autophagy in the anticancer activity of cisplatin in human esophageal cancer cells with acquired cisplatin resistance. In response to cisplatin treatment, EC109 cells exhibited substantial apoptosis and senescence whereas cisplatin-resistant EC109/CDDP cells exhibited resistance. In this respect, cisplatin increased ERK phosphorylation whose inhibition by MEK inhibitor significantly attenuated the cytotoxic and cytostatic effect of cisplatin. Notably, cisplatin preferentially induces autophagy in EC109/CDDP cells but not in EC109 cells. Moreover, the induction of autophagy was accompanied by the suppression of mTORC1 activity. Abolition of autophagy by pharmacological inhibitors or knockdown of ATG5/7 re-sensitized EC109/CDDP cells. Co-administration of an autophagy inhibitor chloroquine and cisplatin significantly suppressed tumor growth whereas cisplatin monotherapy failed to elicit anticancer activity in nude mice xenografted with EC109/CDDP cells. To conclude, our data implicate autophagic response as a key mechanism of acquired resistance to cisplatin, suggesting that autophagy is a novel target to improve therapy efficiency of cisplatin toward human esophageal cancers with acquired resistance.
