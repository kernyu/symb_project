In order to assess the resistance situation against macrocyclic lactones in Parascaris equorum and against tetrahydropyrimidine derivatives in strongyles in Finnish trotter horses, 112 foals on 18 farms, mostly 1 year old, were examined for these parasites with a modified McMaster faecal flotation method. P. equorum positive foals (n=24) were given ivermectin orally at a dose of 200 mug/kg b.w., while strongyle positive but P. equorum negative foals (n=38) received pyrantel embonate orally at a dose of 19 mg/kg. Sixteen P. equorum infected foals, treated with ivermectin, also harboured strongyles. During the anthelmintic treatment visit to the farm, Faecal Egg Count Reduction Test (FECRT) reference (first) samples were collected. Fourteen days later, the second sampling (reduction samples) was done. The FECR was calculated for each foal/parasite combination. The reduction efficacies of ivermectin against P. equorum (mean 52%, calculated from the individual egg count reductions) and pyrantel against strongyles (43%) were strongly indicative of widespread resistance. Also indication of ivermectin resistance among strongyles was seen. The widespread use of anthelmintics for Finnish horses obviously has resulted in resistance, as has happened elsewhere, too.
