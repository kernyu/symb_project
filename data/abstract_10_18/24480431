Today resistance against carbapenems is considered an emerging problem in Bacteroides fragilis. Carbapenemase activities produced by aerobic bacteria have been detected by looking at hydrolysis of carbapenems with MALDI-TOF MS, but this technique was never used for anaerobic bacteria. We have developed a protocol for detection and verification of carbapenemase production in B. fragilis within 2.5 h. Twenty-eight strains of B. fragilis were tested. Of the sixteen cfiA-positive strains all showed hydrolysis of ertapenem, whereas the twelve cfiA-negative strains showed no hydrolysis. Ertapenem hydrolysis could be inhibited with 2,6-Pyridinecarboxylic acid (DPA) in all cfiA-positive strains, verifying the presence of the metallo-beta-lactamase. Here we show a rapid way to detect carbapenemase activities of B. fragilis strains.
