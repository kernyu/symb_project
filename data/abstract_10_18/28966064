Orthodontic brackets made from stainless steel were introduced in dentistry, though they have less ability in reducing enamel demineralization and are not successful in preventing microbial as well as biofilm growth. In this study, we evaluated the significant role of different brackets in reducing enamel demineralization indirectly. Results from different tests indicate the significant reduction in adhesion, biofilm formation and slow growth of tested bacterial species on brackets coated with Ag + TiO2 and found to be statistically significant lower than control. There was no loss in cell viability in all brackets indicating that the cells are biocompatible with different bracket materials. Scanning electron microscopy showed less bacteria attached with the surface coated with Ag + TiO2 indicated that bacteria were losing adherent nature on coated surface. In conclusion, TiO2+Ag coating on stainless steel brackets possessed anti-adherent properties and also have demonstrable antibacterial properties therefore helps in preventing dental caries and plaque accumulation indirectly. The cell compatibility of TiO2+Ag coated brackets is superior to the uncoated samples therefore can be used in orthodontics as it not only provide suitable antimicrobial activity and resistance to biofilm formation but also sustained the cell viability of human gingival fibroblast (HGF) cell lines.
