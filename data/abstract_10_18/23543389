PURPOSE: The incidence of gram-negative bacterial haematogenous vertebral osteomyelitis (GNB HVO) is increasing. We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with this type of infection in an effort to gain an improved understanding of the current clinical presentation, management and outcome. METHODS: Between May 2007 and May 2010, all patients, over the age of 18 years, suffering from GNB HVO were identified and their microbiological diagnoses were evaluated. RESULTS: This study identified seventy-nine patients with haematogenous vertebral osteomyelitis (HVO). Of these seventy-nine patients, 10 patients (12.66%) had Gram-negative organisms isolated. These organisms included Escherichia coli (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Klebsiella pneumonia (1), Haemophilus influenza (1) and Enterobacter cloacae (1). Eight patients were successfully treated with antibiotics and/or surgery. Of the eight patients whose HVO was cured, five had Ciprofloxacin as part of their definitive antibiotic regime. CONCLUSION: The treatment of GNB HVO is often challenging because of unpredictable resistance patterns and limited published data on effective treatment regimens. Our study has highlighted the need for prompt microbiological sampling and initiation of early appropriate antibiotic regime. The most effective treatment for GNB HVO was with oral Ciprofloxacin over a period of 6-8 weeks.
