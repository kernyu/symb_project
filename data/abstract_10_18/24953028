A new series of small cationic peptidomimetics were synthesized by incorporating 3-amino benzoic acid (3-ABA) in a small structural framework with the objective to mimic essential properties of natural antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). The new design approach resulted into improvement of activity and selectivity in comparison to linear peptides and allowed us to better understand the influence of structural amphipathicity on biological activity. Lead peptidomimetics displayed antibacterial activities against resistant pathogens (MRSA & MRSE). A calcein dye leakage experiment revealed a membranolytic effect of 4g and 4l which was further confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. In addition, proteolytic stability and no sign of resistance development against Staphylococcus aureus and MRSA demonstrate their potential for further development as novel antimicrobial therapeutics.
