The genus Acremonium (formerly known as Cephalosporium) is a large polyphyletic fungal genus that comprises approximately 150 phylogenetically distant species, commonly isolated from the environment. Clinical cases concern mostly superficial infections after traumatic inoculation, but there are reports of opportunistic invasive infections in immunocompromised patients. Acremonium kiliense has been described as a cause of mycetoma, keratitis, endophthalmitis, endocarditis, and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis. We describe an unusual cluster of possible catheter-related bloodstream infections due to this pathogen in patients who underwent haematopoietic cell transplantation.
