BACKGROUND: The long-term use of calcium hydroxide has been discouraged throughout the recent decade due to a proposed decrease in fracture resistance of dentin. This weakening has grave implications when used on immature teeth with thin dentinal walls in procedures such as apexogenesis. AIM: The purpose of this study was to identify the effects of three commercial calcium hydroxide formulations (Vitapex, Ultracal XS and Pulpdent) on the fracture resistance of dentin in relation to time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two-hundred and forty deciduous lamb incisors were collected, cleaned and shaped, and filled with one of the three calcium hydroxide formulations and one negative saline control. At one, three, and 6 months, these teeth were fractured on an Instron machine to determine fracture resistance. RESULTS: No statistical differences were observed among any of the experimental groups, nor between any of the experimental groups and negative control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, there appears insufficient evidence to support that either Vitapex, Ultracal XS, or Pulpdent will cause a decrease in fracture resistance of dentin within a 6-month period.
