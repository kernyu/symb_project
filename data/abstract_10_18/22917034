To identify the novel inhibitors of endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced cell death, we performed a high throughput assay with a chemical library containing a total of 3280 bioactive small molecules. Cyclosporine A and bromocriptine were identified as potent inhibitors of thapsigargiin-induced cell death (cut-off at 4sigma standard score) . However, U74389G, the potent inhibitor of lipid peroxidation had lower activity in inhibiting cell death. The inhibition effect of cyclosporine A and bromocriptine was specific for only thapsigargin-induced cell death. The mechanism of inhibition by these compounds was identified as modification of the expression of glucose regulated protein-78 (GRP-78/Bip) and inhibition of phosphorylation of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK). However, these compounds did not inhibit the same events triggered by tunicamycin, which was in agreement with the cell survival data. We suggest that the induction of protective unfolded protein response by these compounds confers resistance to cell death. In summary, we identified compounds that may provide insights on cell death mechanisms stimulated by ER stress.
