Bullous scabies is a rare disease that is usually diagnosed in elderly patients. The clinical, histological, and immunological findings are identical to bullous pemphigoid. In a review of the literature, we found reports of 24 cases. We present a new case of bullous scabies in a 72-year-old man. The lesions responded to treatment with oral ivermectin.
