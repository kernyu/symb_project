Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are most important respiratory pathogens with increasing antimicrobial resistance among the key pathogens responsible for community-acquired respiratory tract infections and have the potential to limit the effectiveness of antibiotics available to treat these infections. In the present study, a total of 18 isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae and 9 isolates of Haemophilus influenzae were characterised from specimens obtained from patients of acute respiratory tract infections including otitis media, tonsillitis, bronchitis, pneumonia and sinusitis. In the present study, all the Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were sensitive to coamoxiclav and to cefixime, while they showed variable resistance to the other antibiotics screened. The degree of resistance to various antibiotics was as follows: Streptococcus pneumoniae showed resistance to cotrimoxazole (66.7%), azithromycin (55.6%), erythromycin (16.7%), chloramphenicol (16.7%), clindamycin (11.1%) and penicillin (11.1%). Haemophilus influenzae showed resistance to cefixime 100%, chloramphenicol 88.9%, penicillin 77.8%, erythromycin 77.8%, cefuroxime 77.8%, azithromycin 77.8%, and clindamycin 11.1%. The present study showed the emergence of variable resistance to penicillin, cotrimoxazole and other antibiotics.
