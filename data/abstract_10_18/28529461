Treatment of non-tuberculous mycobacterial lung disease (NTM-LD) is challenging for several reasons including the relative resistance of NTM to currently available drugs and the difficulty in tolerating prolonged treatment with multiple drugs. Yet-to-be-done, large, multicenter, prospective randomized studies to establish the best regimens will also be arduous because multiple NTM species are known to cause human lung disease, differences in virulence and response to treatment between different species and strains within a species will make randomization more difficult, the need to distinguish relapse from a new infection, and the difficulty in adhering to the prescribed treatment due to intolerance, toxicity, and/or drug-drug interactions, often necessitating modification of therapeutic regimens. Furthermore, the out-of-state resident status of many patients seen at the relatively few centers that care for large number of NTM-LD patients pose logistical issues in monitoring response to treatment. Thus, current treatment regimens for NTM-LD is largely based on small case series, retrospective analyses, and guidelines based on expert opinions. It has been nearly 10 years since the publication of a consensus guideline for the treatment of NTM-LD. This review is a summary of the available evidence on the treatment of the major NTM-LD until more definitive studies and guidelines become available.
