The cytoplasmic membrane of Staphylococcus aureus contains approximately 20 mol% of the net cationic lipid lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol (LPG). Elevated fractions of LPG are associated with increased resistance to cationic antibiotics, including the lipopeptide daptomycin (DAP). Although the surface charge of the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane is altered by LPG, surface binding of DAP was found to be only moderately affected in anionic vesicles containing 20 mol% LPG. These results suggest that charge repulsion cannot fully explain LPG-mediated resistance to cationic peptides.
