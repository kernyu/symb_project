Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an emerging opportunistic pathogen, classified by the World Health Organization as one of the leading multidrug-resistant organisms in hospital settings. The need to discover novel compounds and/or combination therapies for S. maltophilia is urgent. We demonstrate the in vitro efficacy of aztreonam-avibactam (ATM-AVI) against S. maltophilia and kinetically characterize the inhibition of the L2 beta-lactamase by avibactam. ATM-AVI overcomes aztreonam resistance in selected clinical strains of S. maltophilia, addressing an unmet medical need.
