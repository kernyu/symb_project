The in vitro activity of telavancin was determined for 94 diverse Staphylococcus spp. Telavancin had MIC(90) values of 0.5 mug/mL for methicillin-susceptible, methicillin-resistant, and vancomycin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates. Telavancin MICs were 0.5-1 mug/mL for vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus isolates and 2-4 mug/mL for vancomycin-resistant S. aureus strains.
