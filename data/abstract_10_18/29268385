Background: Drug resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) is a rising issue in the management of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Epidemiological monitoring is essential for identifying resistant patterns of MP isolates against various antibiotics in adult CAP patients. Methods: This is a prospectively designed multicenter study conducted on adult patients with CAP visiting six teaching hospitals in the cities of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou between September 2010 and June 2012. Results: A total of 520 adult patients (mean age: 45.7+/-26.2 years) with CAP visiting teaching hospitals in the cities of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou were included. Of the 520 patients, only 75 (14.42%) were confirmed MP positive by means of culture and real-time PCR methods. Quinolones were the most common initially prescribed antimicrobial, followed by beta-lactams and beta-lactams plus quinolones. Macrolide resistance was as high as 80% and 72% against erythromycin (ERY) and azithromycin (AZM) respectively, which were associated with the A2063G transition mutation in domain V of the 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. Six strains with mild to moderate ERY-resistant level were still susceptible to AZM. Tetracycline (TET), minocycline (MIN) and quinolones [moxifloxacin (MOX) and fluoroquinolones] had no signs of resistance. Conclusions: High resistance was observed with macrolides, whereas, none of the MP strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones and TET. Hence, macrolide resistant MP (MRMP)_infections could be well treated with fluoroquinolones. However, few isolated strains had minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values on the edge of resistance to quinolones, alarming a quinolone-resistant MP in the near future.
