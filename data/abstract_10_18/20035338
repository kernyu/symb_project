Management of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) dramatically improved during the 1990s. The advent of high-performance quantitative HIV assays and highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) were the two most important developments in HIV medicine. As a result, HIV mortality and morbidity have significantly reduced. This improvement in life quality and expectancy through the use of HAART has led to an increase in the number of HIV-infected patients wishing to have children. The mother-to-child transmission which was of major concern previously can now be significantly reduced by newer management strategies. This review stresses on the management of pregnancy in HIV.
