OBJECTIVE: To investigate the drug resistance of imipenem-resistant (IR) Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) in coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP)-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and to provide a basis for clinical treatment. METHODS: Sixty-six strains of IR-GNB were isolated from the sputum of CWP-COPD patients with LRTI, and the bacterial spectrum was investigated. The drug resistance of bacterial strains was studied by KB disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Among the 66 strains of IR-GNB, 29 (43.9%) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 17 (25.8%) were Acinetobacter baumannii, and 11 (16.7%) were Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The drug sensitivity test showed that all bacteria had high drug resistance; Pseudomonas aeruginosa had a susceptibility rate higher than 50% to ciprofloxacin, polymyxin B, fosfomycin, and amikacin, Acinetobacter baumannii had a susceptibility rate higher than 55% to fosfomycin, polymyxin B, and cefoperazone/sulbactam, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia had a susceptibility rate higher than 50% to cotrimoxazole, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, levofloxacin, polymyxin B, and cefoperazone/sulbactam, and Pseudomonas cepacia had a susceptibility rate higher than 50% to piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone/sulbactam, and polymyxin B. CONCLUSION: The main species of IR-GNB are such non-fermentative bacteria as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in CWP-COPD patients with LRTI. These bacteria have high drug resistance and are sensitive to only a limited range of antibiotics.
