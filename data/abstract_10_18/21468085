AIM: Widespread and repeated use of azoles, particularly fluconazole, has led to the rapid development of azole resistance in Candida albicans. We investigated the role of CaIPF14030 during the development of azole resistance in C albicans. METHODS: The expression of CaIPF14030 was measured by quantitative RT-PCR, and CaIPF14030 was disrupted by the hisG-URA3-hisG (URA-blaster) method. The sensitivity of C albicans to azoles was examined using a spot assay, and the intracellular ATP concentrations were measured by a luminometer. RESULTS: CaIPF14030 expression in C albicans was up-regulated by Ca(2+) in a calcineurin-dependent manner, and the protein was overexpressed during the stepwise acquisition of azole resistance. However, disruption or ectopic overexpression of CaIPF14030 did not affect the sensitivity of C albicans to azoles. Finally, we demonstrated that disruption of CaIPF14030 significantly increased intracellular ATP levels, and overexpression significantly decreased intracellular ATP levels in C albicans. CONCLUSION: CaIPF14030 may negatively modulate intracellular ATP levels during the development of azole resistance in C albicans.
