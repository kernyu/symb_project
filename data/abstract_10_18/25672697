Improvement of outcomes represents the most important problem in the treatment of bacterial meningitis. To achieve such improvement, revision of the guidelines for the clinical management of bacterial meningitis in Japan has been carried out, and these revised Japanese guidelines will soon be published. The choice of specific antimicrobial agents for initial treatment in bacterial meningitis is influenced by a number of factors, including patient age, systemic symptoms, and local patterns of bacterial resistance. In the revised Japanese guidelines, antimicrobial agents based on current knowledge of the epidemiology in Japan are recommended. Bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency, and patients with this disease require immediate medical assessment and appropriate treatment. Rapid diagnosis and treatment of bacterial meningitis reduces mortality and neurological sequelae. We describe the revised Japanese guidelines for the clinical management of bacterial meningitis 2014, with a focus on adults.
