OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of tetrandrine citrate, a novel tetrandrine salt with high water solubility, on the growth of imatinib (IM)-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in vitro and in vivo, and reveal action molecular mechanisms. METHODS: Cell viability in vitro was measured using methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay. CML cell growth in vivo was assessed using a xenograft model in nude mice. Bcr-Abl and beta-catenin protein levels were determined using Western blotting. Bcr-Abl messenger RNA (mRNA) was measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Flow cytometry (FCM) was used to determine cell cycle status. RESULTS: Tetrandrine citrate inhibited the growth of IM-resistant K562 cells, primary leukemia cells, and primitive CD34(+) leukemia cells, and their inhibition concentration that inhibited 50% of target cells (IC(50)) ranged from 1.20 to 2.97 mug/ml. In contrast, tetrandrine citrate did not affect normal blood cells under the same conditions, and IC(50) values were about 10.12-13.11 mug/ml. Oral administration of tetrandrine citrate caused complete regression of IM-resistant K562 xenografts in nude mice without overt toxicity. Western blot results revealed that treatment of IM-resistant K562 cells with tetrandrine citrate resulted in a significant decrease of both p210(Bcr-Abl) and beta-catenin proteins, but IM did not affect the Bcr-Abl protein levels. Proteasome inhibitor, MG132, did not prevent tetrandrine-mediated decrease of the p210(Bcr-Abl) protein. RT-PCR results showed that tetrandrine treatment caused a decrease of Bcr-Abl mRNA. FCM analysis indicated that tetrandrine induced gap 1 (G(1)) arrest in CML cells. CONCLUSIONS: Tetrandrine citrate is a novel orally active tetrandrine salt with potent anti-tumor activity against IM-resistant K562 cells and CML cells. Tetrandrine citrate-induced growth inhibition of leukemia cells may be involved in the depletion of p210(Bcr-Abl) mRNA and beta-catenin protein.
