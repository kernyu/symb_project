The TiO2/HZSM-11 materials were synthesized using titanium isopropoxide as a TiO2 precursor and HZSM-11 a medium pore size zeolite with high thermal and chemical resistance as support. The amount of titanium isopropoxide was varied in order to obtain TiO2 concentrations of 3, 10, 20, 30 and 50 wt% in the final material. They were characterized by a series of complementary techniques: X-ray diffraction (XRD), ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), transmittance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The surface area of the TiO2/HZSM-11 samples decreased with the increment of TiO2 loading. As result of the increment of the calcination temperature from 450 to 800 degrees C an increase in the size of the anatase crystals was observed. However, the X-ray diffraction patterns of the solids only presented the characteristic peaks of the anatase phase. The catalytic activity of the materials in the photodegradation of Dichlorvos (DDVP) depended on the TiO2 amount the thermal treatment temperature. The sample containing 30% TiO2 calcined at 450 degrees C showed the best catalytic performance and it can be reused without noticeable activity loss during at least four cycles. The catalytic performance was similar to that of the P25 Degussa used as a reference but its separation, recovery and reuse was easier.
