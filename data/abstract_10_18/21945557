The resistance of bacteria to 12 different antibiotics was investigated in shrimp farms on Donghai Island, China. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were found to be widespread in shrimp farms, indicating a high environmental risk. Further, significant differences were found in bacterial strains among farms (ANOVA, p<0.05), showing resistance to antibiotics such as ampicillin, trimethoprim, compound sinomi, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and cefazolin. No significant differences in antibiotic resistance were found among 6 hatcheries evaluated in this study (ANOVA, p>0.05), between exalted and traditional shrimp ponds (ANOVA, p>0.05), and between cultural ponds and corresponding control water source sites (T-test, p>0.05). In cultural ponds, no significant difference in bacterial resistance to antibiotics was found between water and sediment (T-test, p>0.05), and antibiotic resistance of bacteria from water showed a significant positive correlation with that from sediment (p<0.05). Therefore, our study indicates that bacterial multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) is more widespread in shrimp hatcheries than ponds.
