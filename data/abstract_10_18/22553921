Cellular resistance to chemotherapeutics that alkylate the O-6 position of guanine residues in DNA correlates with their O(6)-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase activity. In normal cells high [O(6)-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase] is beneficial, sparing the host from toxicity, whereas in tumor cells high [O(6)-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase] prevents chemotherapeutic response. Therefore, it is necessary to selectively inactivate O(6)-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase in tumors. The oxygen-deficient compartment unique to solid tumors is conducive to reduction, and could be utilized to provide this selectivity. Therefore, we synthesized 2-nitro-6-benzyloxypurine, an analog of O(6)-benzylguanine in which the essential 2-amino group is replaced by a nitro moiety, and 2-nitro-6-benzyloxypurine is >2000-fold weaker than O(6)-benzylguanine as an O(6)-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase inhibitor. We demonstrate oxygen concentration sensitive net reduction of 2-nitro-6-benzyloxypurine by cytochrome P450 reductase, xanthine oxidase, and EMT6, DU145, and HL-60 cells to yield O(6)-benzylguanine. We show that 2-nitro-6-benzyloxypurine treatment depletes O(6)-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase in intact cells under oxygen-deficient conditions and selectively sensitizes cells to laromustine (an agent that chloroethylates the O-6 position of guanine) under oxygen-deficient but not normoxic conditions. 2-Nitro-6-benzyloxypurine represents a proof of concept lead compound; however, its facile reduction (E(1/2) - 177 mV versus Ag/AgCl) may result in excessive oxidative stress and/or the generation of O(6)-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase inhibitors in normoxic regions in vivo.
