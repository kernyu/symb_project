The accumulated mucin in non-Gottron's dermatomyositis (DM) lesions is primarily chondroitin-4-sulfate (C4S), which is immunomodulatory in vitro. Gottron's papules are a particularly resistant manifestation of DM that often persist after other lesions have resolved with therapy. We examined non-Gottron's DM lesions and Gottron's papule skin biopsies for C4S, CD44 variant 7 (CD44v7), a chondroitin sulfate-binding isoform causally implicated in autoimmunity, and osteopontin (OPN), a CD44v7 ligand implicated in chronic inflammation. Gottron's papule dermis contained more C4S and CD44v7 than non-Gottron's lesions. Normal skin showed less CD44v7 over joints relative to Gottron's lesions. All DM dermis had increased OPN compared with healthy skin. Mechanically stretching cultured fibroblasts for 6 hours induced CD44v7 mRNA and protein, whereas IFN-gamma treatment induced OPN mRNA and protein. OPN alone did not induce CD44v7, but stretching dermal fibroblasts in the presence of OPN increased human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) monocyte binding, which is blunted by anti-CD44v7 blocking antibody. C4S, CD44v7, and OPN are three molecules uniquely present in Gottron's papules that contribute to inflammation individually and in association with one another. We propose that stretch-induced CD44v7 over joints, in concert with dysregulated OPN levels in the skin of DM patients, increases local inflammatory cell recruitment and contributes to the pathogenesis and resistance of Gottron's papules.
