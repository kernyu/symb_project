Antibiotics have made a significant contribution to improving the health of patients suffering from bacterial infections. Today in an era of high health costs and limited resources more than ever, doctors in the ambulatory care and hospitals must effectively manage the use of antibiotics to control costs and preserve their usefulness. To achieve this goal, antibiotic management must evolve from simplistic antibiotic cost containment to more complex, appropriate use program that are founded on clinical outcomes-based pharmacoeconomic analyses. The findings of pharmacoeconomic analysis indicate that the cost-effectiveness of antibiotics is influenced by many factors, including diagnosis, comparative costs and comparative effectiveness, resistance, compliance, and treatment failure. Moreover, external factors like guideline implementation and funding source should be considered in such assessment. The successful application of pharmacoeconomic principles to antimicrobial therapy requires maximizing therapeutic effectiveness while minimizing costs, with the primary on pharmacokinetic considerations. This article reviews the various pharmacoeconomic factors that affect antibiotic costs used in respiratory infections treatment in relation to patients and institutions.
