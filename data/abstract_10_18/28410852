Cefiderocol (formerly S-649266) is a new catechol-substituted parenteral siderophore cephalosporin with potent in vitro antibacterial activity against Gram-negative isolates including multidrug-resistant strains. A recent study following CLSI M23-A4 quality control guidelines established cefiderocol MIC QC ranges against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 (0.06-0.5 mug/mL) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (0.06-0.5 mug/mL).
