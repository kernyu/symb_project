Periapical periodontitis usually results from microbial infection, with these microorganisms occasionally migrating to the root canal, which can lead to further, potentially life-threatening, complications. Here, the susceptibility of 27 bacterial strains to various antimicrobial agents was evaluated. These strains comprised 13 species; 16 of the strains were clinical isolates from periapical lesions. Each strain was inoculated onto blood agar plates containing one of the antimicrobial agents. The plates were incubated anaerobically at 37 degrees C for 96 hr and the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) determined. Ten strains required an MIC of 32 mug/ml or greater for amoxicillin, 6 for cefmetazole, and 5 for cefcapene among beta-lactam antibiotics; 8 strains required an MIC of 32 mug/ml or greater for clindamycin, 4 for azithromycin, and 11 for clarithromycin among macrolide antibiotics; 3 strains required an MIC of 32 mug/ml or greater for ciprofloxacin and 2 for ofloxacin among fluoroquinolones. The effect of cefcapene on 5 strains was evaluated after biofilm formation to investigate the relationship between biofilm formation and susceptibility. All strains showed a decrease in susceptibility after biofilm formation. The results revealed that several antimicrobial agents commonly used in a clinical setting, including amoxicillin, cefmetazole, and clindamycin, are potentially effective in the treatment of orofacial odontogenic infections. The development of resistant strains, however, means that this can no longer be guaranteed. In addition, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin were more effective than the 3 beta-lactam antibiotics tested. These results suggest that sensitivity testing is needed if odontogenic infections are to be treated safely and effectively.
