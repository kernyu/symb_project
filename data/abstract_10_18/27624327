Rapid microbial diagnostics is important for septicemic patients. The current gold standard is blood culture with consecutive pathogen identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. However, these culture-based methods need at least 48 h.The aim of this study was to compare Verigene((R)) (Nanosphere, Northbrook, IL, USA), a rapid hybridization-based method, with conventional culture-based methods for detection of pathogens and resistance markers from positive blood cultures of septic patients.In 85 of 100 tested blood culture samples (85 %), pathogen identification as well as resistance profile were identical in Verigene and conventional culture. In 4 %, discordant results were observed. In 9 %, conventional culture revealed a pathogen ID or resistance phenotype not included in the Verigene panel. In 2 % no Verigene result was available.In conclusion, Verigene offers the availability of fast and reliable pathogen identification and resistance profile determination, which may result in an earlier start of adequate antimicrobial treatment.
