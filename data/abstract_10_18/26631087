The treatment of drug-sensitive tuberculosis consists of 2 months of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol, followed by 4 months of isoniazid and rifampin. These drugs are well tolerated and cure rate are above 95 %. In contrast the treatment of drug-resistent tuberculosis is difficult, mostly due to side effects of the drugs used under these circumstances. Therefore, any treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis has to be done by experts.
