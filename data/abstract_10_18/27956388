Autophagy is a lysosomal pathway involved in degradation of intracellular material. It appears as an adaptation mechanism that is essential for cellular homeostasis in response to various stress conditions. Over the past decade, many studies have linked alteration of autophagy with cancer initiation and progression, autoimmune, inflammatory, metabolic, and degenerative diseases. This review highlights recent findings on the impact of autophagy on leukemic transformation of normal hematopoietic stem cells and summarizes its role on leukemic cell response to chemotherapy.
