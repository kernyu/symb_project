Three copolymers containing the functional groups P=O, S=O and C=O were prepared, and upon the introduction in calcium phosphate aqueous solutions at physiological conditions, "in vitro" were induced the precipitation of calcium phosphate crystals. The investigation of the crystal growth process was done at constant supersaturation. It is suggested that the negative end of the above functional groups acts as the active site for nucleation of the inorganic phase. In order to obtain the copolymer further antimicrobial activity, titania (TiO(2)) nanocrystals were incorporated in the polymer matrix after silver coverage by UV radiation. The antimicrobial resistance of the composite material (copolymer-titania/Ag) was tested against Staphylococcus epidermidis (SEM), Staphylococcus aureus (SAM), Candida parapsilosis (CAM) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAM), microorganisms, using cut parts of "pi-plate" that covered with the above mentioned composite. The antimicrobial effect increased as the size of the nanocrystals TiO(2)/Ag decreased, the maximum achieved with the third polymer that contained also quartenary ammonium groups.
