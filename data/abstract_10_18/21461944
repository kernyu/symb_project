Candida ciferrii, which is known as an agent of superficial yeast infection and onychomycosis, has rarely been isolated as an agent of candidemia. Limited reports have suggested different patterns of antifungal sensitivity. We report a rare candidemia case caused by c.ciferrii in an 8-year-old child in which isolated candida species were resistant to amphotericin-B (MIC > 1 mug/ml), fluconazole, (MIC >/= 64 mug/ml), caspofungin (MIC >/= 32 mug/ml), and anidulafungin (MIC >/= 32 mug/ml) but sensitive to voriconazole (MIC </= 0.12 mug/ml). As far as we aware, this was the first recorded C. ciferrii candidemia case in children.
