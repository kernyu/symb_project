Evidence supports the current paradigm for the management of patients with recurrent or persistent ovarian carcinoma. The paradigm requires that patients be classified as platinum-sensitive or platinum-resistant. Patients who achieve a complete response with platinum-based therapy and experience at least 6 months free from recurrence should be categorized as having chemosensitive disease and should be retreated with carboplatin-based doublets. Patients who progress while receiving treatment, whose best response is stable disease, or who experience a complete response of <6 months duration should be categorized as having chemoresistant disease and should be treated with a nonplatinum single agent.
