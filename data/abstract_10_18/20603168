The emergence of multidrug-resistant strains of Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAB) constitutes a serious threat to public health and necessitates the discovery of new types of antimicrobial agents. Alyteserin-1c (GLKEIFKAGLGSLVKGIAAHVAS.NH(2)) is a cationic, alpha-helical peptide that was first isolated from skin secretions of the midwife toad Alytes obstetricans. Synthetic alyteserin-1c displayed potent activity against clinical isolates of MDRAB (minimum inhibitory concentration, MIC=5-10 muM; minimum bactericidal concentration, MBC=5-10 muM) while displaying low hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes (LD(50)=220 muM). Increasing the cationicity of alyteserin-1c by the substitution Glu(4)-->Lys enhanced the potency against MDRAB (MIC=1.25-5 muM; MBC=1.25-5 muM) as well as decreasing hemolytic activity (HC(50)>400 muM). More than 99.9% of the bacteria were killed within 30 min by the [E4K] analog at a concentration of 1 x MBC. Increasing the cationicity of [E4K]alyteserin-1c further by the additional substitutions of Ala(8),Val(14) or Ala(18) by l-Lys did not enhance antimicrobial potency. Derivatives of [E4K]alyteserin-1c containing a palmitate group coupled either to alpha-amino group at the N-terminus or to varepsilon-amino group on the Lys(18) residue of the [E4K,A18K] analog retained antimicrobial activity but showed dramatically increased hemolytic activities (>40- and >13-fold, respectively).
