OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to estimate the in vitro activity of ceftaroline against clinical Staphylococcus aureus isolates collected during national surveillance in Belgian acute-care hospitals. Ceftaroline-resistant isolates were further investigated for their resistance mechanisms. METHODS: From October 2013 to March 2014, 155 laboratories of Belgian acute-care hospitals were invited to send to the National Reference Centre-Staphylococcus aureus (Belgium) up to five non-duplicate S. aureus including three MRSA and two MSSA from hospitalized patients. Isolates were analysed by spa typing, SCCmec typing (for MRSA) and PCR for detection of 16S-mecA-nuc and 16S-mecC. MICs of oxacillin, cefoxitin and ceftaroline were determined by the broth microdilution method. The nucleotide sequences of mecA, native pbp and gdpP genes of isolates with reduced susceptibility to ceftaroline were analysed for the presence of mutations responsible for amino acid substitutions. RESULTS: Ninety-nine percent of isolates, including MRSA (n = 284) and MSSA (n = 131), were susceptible to ceftaroline. Only four MRSA isolates showed resistance to ceftaroline (MIC = 2 mg/L). These four isolates belonged to lineages CC5 (n = 1), CC22 (n = 2) and CC8 (n = 1). Two isolates (CC22 and CC8) carried mutations in mecA, as well as in other pbp genes. The remaining isolates carried mutations in native pbp genes or in gdpP. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first Belgian in vitro survey on ceftaroline activity against S. aureus. This antibiotic showed excellent activity against MRSA and MSSA, and only a few MRSA isolates with resistance were found. Reduced susceptibility to ceftaroline seems a complex phenomenon due to the accumulation of mutations in genes involved in beta-lactam tolerance.
