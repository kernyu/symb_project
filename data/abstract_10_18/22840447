OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and effectiveness of albendazole and mebendazole in the treatment of Ascaris lumbricoides (A. lumbricoides) in the North-Western Indonesia. METHODS: 229 primary school children who were positive for A. lumbricoides in their stool were recruited in the study. 123 children received single-dose of 400 mg albendazole and 106 children received single-dose 500 mg of mebendazole. After 1 week, their stools were examined for the cure rate (CR) and egg reduction rate (ERR). Egg culture was also performed and observation was made on week-1, -3, -4. RESULTS: have shown a non-significant difference in CR 96.7%vs. 100% and ERR of 99.3%vs. 100.0% for albendazole and mebendazole groups respectively (P>0.05). In-vitro egg culture has shown trends of decrease in the percentage of the unfertilized eggs and in >/= 2 cell eggs in both treatment groups (P<0.05). The embryonated eggs from the albendazole groups has shown an increase from 7.3% on week-1 to 13.8% on week-4, whilst the mebendazole group has shown a constant increase during the whole 4 weeks of culture from 7.5% to 28.3% (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: No evidence of drug resistance is noted so far from the area of North-Western part of Indonesia. In addition, although both drugs showed incomplete ovicidal effects, single-dose albendazole is better than mebendazole in sterilizing A. lumbricoides eggs.
