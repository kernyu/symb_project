Overexpression of the multidrug efflux pump MDR1 confers resistance to the antifungal drug fluconazole on Candida albicans. It has been reported that two types of MDR1 promoters exist in C. albicans and that homozygosity for the allele with higher activity may promote fluconazole resistance. We found that the two MDR1 promoter alleles in strain SC5314 were equally well activated by inducing chemicals or hyperactive forms of the transcription factors Mrr1 and Cap1, which control MDR1 expression. In addition, no loss of heterozygosity at the MDR1 locus was observed in MDR1-overexpressing clinical C. albicans strains that developed fluconazole resistance during therapy.
