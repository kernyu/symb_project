Malaria treatment with ACTs (Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies), combining a chemical derivative of artemisinin, and a partner drug has, for more than 15 years, produced a notable decrease in the mortality in tropical and subtropical areas. However, since 2008, a serious threat has emerged in western Cambodia, where the clinical efficacy of artemisinins has significantly declined, with a delayed parasite clearance rate and high recrudescence rates in the following weeks. Resistance of Plasmodium to artemisinins is now reported in several countries in South-East Asia. ACTs remain effective as long as the partner drug retains its activity but more and more clinical failures related to parasite resistance to both resistant parasites in sub-Saharan Africa, the continent most affected by malaria, as was the case in the past with other antimalarial treatments. It is therefore essential to better understand, from phenotypic and genotypic points of view, the mechanisms of resistance developed by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum face artemisinin and its derivatives in order to offer new therapeutic tools.
