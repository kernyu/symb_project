BACKGROUND: Although the individual expression of heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate resistance (hVISA) and beta-lactam antibiotic-induced vancomycin resistance (BIVR) phenotypes has been associated with treatment failure and recurrence in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections, the effect of the co-expression of these phenotypic profiles on clinical outcome has not been fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of the combination of hVISA and BIVR phenotypes on the clinical outcome in MRSA bacteremia. METHODS: One hundred and sixty-two MRSA blood isolates from a 21-y period, 1987-2007, were randomly selected. Screening for hVISA was done by the macromethod Etest and confirmed by population analysis profiles. BIVR was identified using Mu3 agar containing 4 mug/ml of vancomycin. RESULTS: Thirty (18.5%) and 39 (24.1%) of the 162 MRSA blood isolates were positive for the hVISA and BIVR phenotypes, respectively. Eighteen (11.1%) isolates possessed both hVISA and BIVR phenotypes (hVISA(+)/BIVR(+)). In a subset of patients who received initial treatment with glycopeptides, only the patients whose isolates were hVISA(+)/BIVR(+) displayed a significantly higher mortality rate in comparison to those with non-hVISA(+)/BIVR(+) (80.0% vs 31.3%, p = 0.004). The presence of both hVISA and BIVR phenotypes was a predictor of mortality using a logistic regression analysis (p = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: The combined phenotype of hVISA and BIVR was associated with a higher probability of mortality in patients with MRSA bacteremia. Further prospective studies are warranted to delineate the clinical significance of the combined phenotype of hVISA and BIVR.
