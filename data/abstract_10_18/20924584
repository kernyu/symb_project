Recombinant Lactococcus lactis MG1363/pMG36e-lacZ exhibiting high beta-galactosidase activities were constructed by us in the previous study. However, erythromycin resistance present in these recombinants restricted their practical application in food preparation. This study was conducted to delete the gene coding for erythromycin resistance present in recombinant L. lactis, as a result of which these bacteria express food-grade beta-galactosidase. In this study, the recombinant plasmid pMG36e-lacZ was digested with restriction enzymes BclI and HpaI and the food-grade plasmid FGZW was rebuilt. FGZW was transformed into Escherichia coli JM109 and L. lactis MG1363. Erythromycin resistance, enzyme activity determination, gene sequencing and SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that these new recombinant bacteria lost erythromycin resistance and its relevant gene but still expressed beta-galactosidase activities, although a decrease in the expression of beta-galactosidase of these new strains was observed. The beta-galactosidase food-grade expression system was successfully constructed and it could provide a new solution for the management of lactose intolerance. These results might promote the usage of gene-modified microorganisms and related technology in the food sector, which has the highest priority for food safety.
