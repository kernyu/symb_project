OBJECTIVES: The high cost of rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB) treatment hinders treatment access. South Africa has a high RR-TB burden, and national policy outlines decentralisation to improve access and reduce costs. We analysed health system costs associated with RR-TB treatment by drug resistance profile and treatment outcome in a decentralised programme. METHODS: Retrospective, routinely collected patient-level data were combined with unit cost data to determine costs for each patient in a cohort treated between January 2009 and December 2011. Drug costs were based on recommended regimens according to drug resistance and treatment duration. Hospitalisation costs were estimated based on admission/discharge dates, while clinic visit and diagnostic/monitoring costs were estimated according to recommendations and treatment duration. Missing data were imputed. RESULTS: Among 467 patients (72% HIV infected), 49% were successfully treated. Treatment was initiated in primary care for 62%, with the remainder as inpatients. The mean cost per patient treated was $7916 (range 260-87,140), ranging from $5369 among patients who did not complete treatment to $23,006 for treatment failure. Mean cost for successful treatment was $8359 (2585-32,506). Second-line drug resistance was associated with a mean cost of $15,567 vs. $6852 for only first-line resistance, with the major cost difference due to hospitalisation. Costs are reported in 2013 USD. CONCLUSIONS: RR-TB treatment cost was high and varied according to treatment outcome. Despite decentralisation, hospitalisation remained a significant cost, particularly among those with more extensive resistance and those with treatment failure. These cost estimates can be used to model the impact of new interventions to improve patient outcomes.
