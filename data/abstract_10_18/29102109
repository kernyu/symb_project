The extensive use of antimicrobials for disease control has caused a remarkable decrease in antimicrobial susceptibility of different animal mycoplasma species, including Mycoplasma agalactiae (M. agalactiae), the main causative agent of contagious agalactia. However, the molecular mechanisms behind M. agalactiae resistance to macrolides and lincomycin have not yet been elucidated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of different antimicrobials and mutations in the 23S rRNA gene and ribosomal proteins L4 and L22, analysing both field isolates (n=50) and in vitro selected resistant mutants of M. agalactiae. The obtained MIC results of the studied field isolates demonstrate an increasing development of tylosin resistance in this bacterium, in comparison to previous studies. Interestingly, predicted amino acid changes in L22 (Ser89Leu and Gln90Lys/His) were the first variations observed when MICs of M. agalactiae started to increase (tylosin MIC >/=0.8mug/ml), whereas mutations at positions 2058 or 2059 of domain V of the 23S rRNA gene appeared from MIC values of 1.6mug/ml. These results were consistent in both field isolates and in vitro selected mutants of M. agalactiae. Thus, although in other mycoplasma species resistance to macrolides and lincosamides had been mainly related to mutations in the 23S rRNA gene, this work demonstrates the role of alterations in ribosomal protein L22 in decreased susceptibility of M. agalactiae. Moreover, these mutations can be used as molecular markers to set an interpretative breakpoint of antimicrobial resistance for M. agalactiae.
