Given its essential role in the process of hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication, the viral NS3/4A serine protease is arguably the most thoroughly characterized HCV enzyme and the most intensively pursued anti-HCV target for drug development thus far. Recent data have demonstrated promise for the NS3 protease inhibitor boceprevir, which, when added to the standard of care peginterferon and ribavirin, improves sustained virological response while shortening duration of therapy in genotype-1-infected individuals. This review discusses the mechanism of action of boceprevir, its effects on HCV, and its viral resistance.
