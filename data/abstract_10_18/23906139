We consider a model incorporating the influence of innate and adaptive immune responses on malaria pathogenesis. By calculating the model reproduction number for a special representation of cytokine interaction, we have shown that the cytokine tumour necrosis factor-alpha can be administered to inhibit malaria infection. We have also found that if the cytokine F * and a generic drug of efficacy epsilon are administered as dual therapy then clearance of the parasite can be achieved even for a generic drug of low efficacy. Our study is recommending administration of dual therapy as a strategy to prevent parasites from developing resistance to malaria treatment drugs.
