Acinetobacter spp. are ubiquitous obligate aerobic bacteria which occur mostly as commensals on the skin, and in soil, water and plants' rhizosphere. Though the species in this genus have been implicated as aetiologies in some nosocomial infections, their versatility covers biodegradation or dissolution leading to bioremediation; catalysis leading to synthesis of high molecular weight, life sustaining polymers; and as growth enhancers in agriculture. The challenge of antibiotic resistance and their mediatory genes is a cause for concern but should not deter the beneficial application of the bacteria especially in the synthesis of novel compounds that would be of relevance in overcoming some global ecological challenges. This review addresses important beneficial attributes of Acinetobacter species as well as gives some insight into emerging trends in their resistance to antibiotics.
