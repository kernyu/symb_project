UNLABELLED: Burkholderia gladioli is a rare cause of bacteremia and sepsis in the absence of such predisposing factors as chronic granulomatous disease, cystic fibrosis, and immunosuppression. Little is known about B. gladioli infection in newborns. The aim of this study was to present the features of B. gladioli infection in newborns. Clinicopathological characteristics, patterns of antimicrobial susceptibility, predisposing factors, and outcomes of B. gladioli bloodstream infection were retrospectively analyzed in newborns treated between 2008 and 2011. During the 3-year study period, B. gladioli was isolated from the blood cultures of 14 patients (3.7 per 1,000 admissions). In all, 5 (35.7 %) of the 14 cases had a positive blood culture at the time of initial admission. Primary diagnoses in the neonates were severe major congenital anomalies, congenital leukemia, prematurity with respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, and parapneumonic pleural effusion. In total, 10 (71.4 %) of the patients underwent >/=2 invasive procedures. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 21.4 %, whereas the mortality rate due to B. gladioli infection was 7 %. CONCLUSION: B. gladioli might be a causative microorganism of both early neonatal and nosocomial sepsis in newborns. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on B. gladioli infection in newborns. Invasive procedures and severe major congenital anomalies may be predisposing factors for B. gladioli bloodstream infection in neonates. Although it appears to have low pathogenic potential and an insidious clinical course in newborns, resistance to antibiotics may be a potential problem. Mortality was primarily associated with underlying diseases.
