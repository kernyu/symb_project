Vibrio harveyi is an opportunistic human pathogen that may cause gastroenteritis, severe necrotizing soft-tissue infections, and primary septicemia, with a potentially high rate of lethality. In this study, we isolated and characterized V. harveyi from seawater collected from the West Sea in Korea, including sites located near shellfish farms. For the initial isolation of putative V. harveyi, isolates were incubated on thiosulfate citrate bile salt sucrose agar plates for 24h, followed by selection of greenish colonies. Gram-negative and oxidase-positive colonies were subsequently confirmed by biochemical assays and the API 20E kit test system. Species-specific 16S rRNA and hemolysin genes were used to design V. harveyi-specific PCR primers. From 840 seawater samples, a total of 2 strains of V. harveyi were isolated from shellfish farm seawater. The two isolates were subjected to profiling against 16 antibiotics and found to be resistant to cephalothin, vancomycin, ampicillin, cefepime, cefotetan, and streptomycin.
