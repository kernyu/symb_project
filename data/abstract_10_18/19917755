Eighteen hundred Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates collected in Sydney, Australia, in 2007 and 2008 were examined for mosaic penA alleles that mediated cephalosporin resistance, and the genotypes of the isolates were evaluated. In 2008, there were substantial increases in numbers (from 15 to 85) and proportions (from 1.5 to 10.3%) of mosaic-containing gonococci and major shifts in genotypic patterns, with 10 new genotypes representing 74 of the 85 mosaic-containing isolates and genotypes detected between 2001 and 2005 having disappeared. Enhanced surveillance of gonococcal resistance to cephalosporins is necessary.
