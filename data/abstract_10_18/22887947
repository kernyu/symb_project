Perturbation of individual microRNAs, or of the microRNA pathway, plays a role in carcinogenesis. In certain cancer cells, inhibition of the microRNA biogenesis pathway leads to a growth arrest state (CoGAM for Colony Growth Arrest induced by Microprocessor inhibition), which can be rescued by re-expression of individual microRNAs such as miR-20a. We now report that inhibition of the microRNA biogenesis pathway induced proteome changes characterized by a size bias in differentially expressed proteins, with induction of small proteins and inhibition of large ones. This size bias was observed in cells undergoing CoGAM, as well as in CoGAM-resistant cells, and in CoGAM-sensitive cells rescued by miR-20a. In this case, GO analysis of induced proteins identified by mass spectrometry revealed a significant enrichment in proteins involved in resistance to oxidative stress. In addition, H(2) O(2) treatment of Saccharomyces cerevisiae or mammalian cells led to similarly size-biased proteome modifications. Our results point to size bias as a relevant readout of proteome modifications, in particular in conditions of stress such as inhibition of the microRNA biogenesis pathway or oxidative stress. They also suggest research avenues to study the role of the microRNA pathway in proteostasis.
