Candida spp. especially Candida albicans is considered as one of the most common cause of fungal infections. The aim of our study was to determine epidemiology of candiduria in children who were referred to an Iranian referral hospital. During May 2011 to February 2013, among 4813 urine culture positive, 209 candida spp. isolates (4.3%) was found. Forty-one percent of cadiduria infection was seen in patients between 1 month and 1 year, 24% in neonatant and 24% in patients 1 to 5 years. Cadiduria was mainly found in patients who had received more than 2 or 3 antibiotic during their hospitalization (37% and 24%, respectively). In our study, the highest frequency of cadiduria was seen in patients who had received more than 2 antibiotics and more than 3 antibiotics during their hospitalization; therefore, the strategic goals to optimize antimicrobial use including optimizing choice and duration of empiric therapy as well as monitoring and providing feedback regarding antibiotic resistance are recommended.
