This study investigates the susceptibility of a clinically metronidazole (Mz)-resistant isolate of Trichomonas vaginalis to alternative anti-trichomonal compounds. The microaerobic minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the 5-nitroimidazole (NI) drug, Mz, against a typical Mz-susceptible isolate of T. vaginalis is around 3.2 microM Mz while the clinically, highly Mz-resistant isolate has an MIC of 50-100 microM. This isolate was cross-resistant to other members of the 5-NI family of compounds including tinidazole and other experimental compounds and maintained resistance under anaerobic conditions. In addition, this isolate was cross-resistant to the 5-nitrothiazole compound nitazoxanide and the 5-nitrofuran derivative, furazolidone. Adenosine analogues toyocamycin and 2-fluoro-2'-deoxyadenosine with no nitro group were also less effective against the clinically Mz-resistant isolate than a Mz-susceptible one. Three other isolates which were determined to be Mz-resistant soon after isolation lost resistance in the long term. One other isolate has maintained some level of permanent Mz resistance (MIC of 25 microM). A multi-drug resistance mechanism may be involved in these clinically Mz-resistant isolates.
