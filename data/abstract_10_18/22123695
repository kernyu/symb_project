We determined the susceptibilities of 144 clinical and 49 environmental Aeromonas strains representing 10 different species to 26 antimicrobial agents by the agar dilution method. No single species had a predominantly nonsusceptible phenotype. A multidrug nonsusceptible pattern was observed in three (2.1%) clinical strains and two (4.0%) strains recovered from diseased fish. Common clinical strains were more resistant than the corresponding environmental isolates, suggesting that resistance mechanisms may be acquired by environmental strains from clinical strains.
