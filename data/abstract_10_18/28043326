Plant virus diseases, known as 'plant cancer', are the second largest plant diseases after plant fungal diseases, which have caused great damage to agricultural industry. Since now, the most direct and effective method for controlling viruses is chemotherapeutics, except for screening of anti-disease species. As the occurrence and harm of plant diseases intensify, production and consumption of pesticides have increased year by year, and greatly contributed to the fertility of agriculture, but also brought a series of problems, such as the increase of drug resistance of plant pathogens and the excessive pesticide residues. In recent years, biopesticide, as characterized by environmentally safe due to low residual, safe to non-target organism due to better specificity and not as susceptible to produce drug resistance due to diverse work ways, has gained more attention than ever before and exhibited great development potential. Now much progress has been made about researches on new biogenic anti-plant-virus substances. The types of active components include proteins, polysaccharides and small molecules (alkaloids, flavonoids, phenols, essential oils) from plants, proteins and polysaccharides from microorganisms, polysaccharides from algae and oligochitosan from animals. This study summarized the research advance of biogenic anti-plant-virus substances in recent years and put forward their further development in the future.
