Triclabendazole is the drug of choice against Fasciola infections in humans and animals. However, parasite resistance against triclabendazole is spreading in veterinary field, and there are no drugs of comparable activity currently available for the treatment and control of fascioliasis. The efficacy of a new rhodanine derivative Ro-354 against adult Fasciola gigantica in vitro was investigated. One hour post incubation, scanning and transmission electron microscopic examination revealed an evident disruption of the tegument of F. gigantica as blebbing, swelling and furrowing. Moreover, an increase in severity of tegumental damage as sloughing and absence of spines was observed. In conclusion, Ro-354 shows potent activity against F. gigantica in vitro, and, the authors recommend carrying out more studies to detect its efficacy in vivo.
