OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pathogens and drug tolerance of infantile dacryocystitis in order to provide evidence for clinical drug use. METHODS: 230 cases of infant dacryocystitis (aged from 2 to 10 months, average 90 days) were analyzed for bacterial culture and drug sensitivity tests. These tests were performed following National Guide to Clinical Laboratory Procedures. Based on the results, analyzed the difference of pathogens in different year, the pathogens kind of dacryocystitis, main pathogens of infantile dacryocystitis, average isolation rate of pathogens and sensitive or resistance drug for pathogens. RESULTS: Average detecting rate was 87.0% (200 cases). There is no difference for detecting rate in each year. The pathogens were predominantly gram-positive coccus 74.5% (149 cases), coagulase-negative staphylococcus 20.5% (41 cases) and staphylococcus aureus 11.0% (22 cases). Majority of these bacteria were sensitive to tobramycin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin. Gram-positive coccus was sensitive to tobramycin and levofloxacin. For gram-negative rod, tobramycin and chloromycetin were most sensitive drug. The sensitivity rates were 96.67% (29 cases). The resistant rates to erythromycin and penicillin were 66.67% (20 cases) and 80.00% (24 cases). CONCLUSION: Coagulase-negative staphylococcus was the main pathogen of infantile dacryocystitis.
