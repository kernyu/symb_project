This study aimed to determine the impact of blood stream infections (BSIs) on outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic SCT (HSCT), and to examine the influence of old (non-levofloxacin-containing) and new (levofloxacin-based) prophylactic antibiotic protocols on the pattern of BSIs. We retrospectively enrolled 246 allogeneic HSCT recipients between January 1999 and June 2006, dividing patients into BSI (within 6 months post-HSCT, n=61) and non-BSI groups (n=185). We found that Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) predominated BSI pathogens (54%). Multivariate analyses showed that patients with a BSI, compared with those without, had a significantly greater 6-month mortality (hazard ratio, 1.75; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-2.82; P=0.021) and a significantly increased length of hospital (LOH) stay (70.8 vs 55.2 days, P=0.014). Moreover, recipients of old and new protocols did not have a significantly different 6-month mortality and time-to-occurrence of BSIs. However, there were significantly more resistant GNB to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenem in recipients of levofloxacin-based prophylaxis. Our data suggest that BSIs occur substantially and impact negatively on the outcome and LOH stay after allogeneic HSCT despite antibiotic prophylaxis. Levofloxacin-based prophylaxis, albeit providing similar efficacy to non-levofloxacin-containing regimens, may be associated with increased antimicrobial resistance.
