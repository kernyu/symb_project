Naphthoquine (NQ), as a component of ARCO(R) which composed of NQ and artemisinin, is a new 4-aminoquinoline antimalarial synthesized by our institute. Here, a naphthoquine-resistant line of rodent malaria parasite was selected through exposing Plasmodium berghei Keyberg 173 strain to progressively increased drug pressure. The selected strain showed a more than 200-fold decreased susceptibility to NQ with a stable resistance phenotype after 10 serial passages without drug pressure or when cryopreserved over a period of 12 months. In a cross-resistance assay, the susceptibility of NQ-resistant parasites to chloroquine was decreased by 14.5-fold. These findings imply NQ-resistant parasites might be selected by long-term usage of NQ in epidemic areas and the efficacy of NQ or ARCO(R) in chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum epidemic areas should be monitored closely.
