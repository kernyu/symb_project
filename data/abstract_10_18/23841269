OBJECTIVE: To study the reverse effect and its mechanism of tetrandrine (Tet) on human breast cancer cells resistant to tamoxifen (MCF-7/TAM). METHODS: The drug toxicity and the reverse effect of Tet on MCF-7/TAM cells were detected by MTT assay. The effects of multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) gene of Tet on MCF-7iTAM cells were detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR. The changes of MRP1 protein on MCF-7JTAM cells were detected by Western blot. RESULTS: Tet had a significant reversal of drug resistance on MCF-7/TAM cells. The non-cytotoxic dose (0. 625 microg/mL) reversed the resistance by 2.0 folds. MRP1 was reduced at gene (P <0.05) and protein levels when Tet effected on MCF-7ITAM cells. CONCLUSION: Tet could reverse the drug resistance of MCF-7/TAM cells, and the reverse mechanism may be related to down-regulating MRP1 expression.
