OBJECTIVES: The incidence of multidrug-resistant bacteria in wildlife animals has been investigated to improve our knowledge of the spread of clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance genes. The aim of this study was to report the first draft genome sequence of an extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa ST644 isolate recovered from a Magellanic penguin with a footpad infection (bumblefoot) undergoing rehabilitation process. METHODS: The genome was sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq((R)) platform using 150-bp paired-end reads. De novo genome assembly was performed using Velvet v.1.2.10, and the whole genome sequence was evaluated using bioinformatics approaches from the Center of Genomic Epidemiology, whereas an in-house method (mapping of raw whole genome sequence reads) was used to identify chromosomal point mutations. RESULTS: The genome size was calculated at 6436450bp, with 6357 protein-coding sequences and the presence of genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, phenicols, sulphonamides, tetracyclines, quinolones and fosfomycin; in addition, mutations in the genes gyrA (Thr83Ile), parC (Ser87Leu), phoQ (Arg61His) and pmrB (Tyr345His), conferring resistance to quinolones and polymyxins, respectively, were confirmed. CONCLUSION: This draft genome sequence can provide useful information for comparative genomic analysis regarding the dissemination of clinically significant antibiotic resistance genes and XDR bacterial species at the human-animal interface.
