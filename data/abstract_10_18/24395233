The discovery of new compounds that are able to inhibit the growth of Burkholderia cenocepacia is of primary importance for cystic fibrosis patients. Here, the mechanism of resistance to a new pyridine derivative already shown to be effective against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and to have good activity toward B. cenocepacia was investigated. Increased expression of a resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) efflux system was detected in the resistant mutants, thus confirming their important roles in B. cenocepacia antibiotic resistance.
