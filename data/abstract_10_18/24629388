Urinary tract infection is common in the elderly, and the prevalence increases with age due to pathological changes in the urinary tract and common use of bladder catheter. The increasing incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria, together with fewer classical dysuria symptoms complicates the diagnosis in the elderly. There is also an increasing prevalence of complicated urinary tract infection including septicaemia. Due to an increase in antibiotic resistance urine culture should precede the choice of antibiotic treatment. Treatment duration is seven days; 14 days in patients with pyelonephritis. Adverse effects are notably higher in the elderly.
