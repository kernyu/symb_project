A total of 97 out of 245 carcass, sewage effluent, and table surface samples in meat shops at the retail markets in North Vietnam showed Salmonella positive. Eleven Salmonella serovars, including Infantis, Anatum, Rissen, Reading, London, Typhimurium, Enteritidis, Agona, Newport, Emek, and Derby, were identified. The Salmonella isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility and further investigated for antimicrobial resistance genes. Resistance to kanamycin, gentamicin, neomycin, nalidixic acid, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, streptomycin, tetracycline, ampicillin, and sulphonamides was found in 28.9-56.7%. The isolates were neither resistant to ceftazidime nor norfloxacin. Sixty-four (66.0%) out of 97 isolates were resistant to at least one of 14 antimicrobials, and 55 (85.9%) out of the 64 isolates showed multidrug resistance. Thirteen resistance genes (bla(TEM), bla(OXA-1), aadA1, sul1, tetA, tetB, tetG, cmlA1, floR, dfrA1, dfrA12, aac(3)-IV, and aphA1-1AB) were detected in the resistant isolates. This study indicates that Salmonella isolated from meat shops were resistant to multiple antimicrobials, and the resistance genes were widespread among the serovars isolated.
