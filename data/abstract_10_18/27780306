The mechanisms of persistence and virulence associated with Candida glabrata infections are poorly understood, limiting the ability to fight this fungal pathogen. In this study, the multidrug resistance transporters CgTpo1_1 and CgTpo1_2 are shown to play a role in C. glabrata virulence. The survival of the infection model Galleria mellonella, infected with C. glabrata, was found to increase upon the deletion of either CgTPO1_1 or CgTPO1_2. The underlying mechanisms were further explored. In the case of CgTpo1_1, this phenotype was found to be consistent with the observation that it confers resistance to antimicrobial peptides (AMP), such as the human AMP histatin-5. The deletion of CgTPO1_2, on the other hand, was found to limit the survival of C. glabrata cells when exposed to phagocytosis and impair biofilm formation. Interestingly, CgTPO1_2 expression was found to be up-regulated during biofilm formation, but and its deletion leads to a decreased expression of adhesin-encoding genes during biofilm formation, which is consistent with a role in biofilm formation. CgTPO1_2 expression was further seen to decrease plasma membrane potential and affect ergosterol and fatty acid content. Altogether, CgTpo1_1 and CgTpo1_2 appear to play an important role in the virulence of C. glabrata infections, being at the cross-road between multidrug resistance and pathogenesis.
