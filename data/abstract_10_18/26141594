PURPOSE: The problem of drug sensitivity and predicting the outcome of chemotherapy seems to be of great importance in hemato-oncological disorders. There are some factors that can help to predict effects of chemotherapy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), such as presence of del17p, del11q, or TP53 gene mutations, which result in resistance to purine analogues and alkylating drugs. Despite the new therapeutic options introduced recently, purine analogues in combination with cyclophosphamide and the monoclonal antibody rituximab is still the gold standard for the first-line treatment of fit patients with CLL. The aim of this study was to assess whether the rate of apoptosis caused by one of purine analogues-fludarabine in cell cultures differs between patients who clinically respond to fludarabine-based chemotherapy and those who do not respond. METHODS: CLL leukemic cells, obtained from peripheral blood and bone marrow of 23 patients, were cultured in the presence of fludarabine. After 24 h of incubation, the rate of apoptosis, indicated by the expression of active caspase-3, was assessed with flow cytometry and then analyzed regarding clinical response to fludarabine-based regimens. RESULTS: The percentage of apoptotic cells induced by fludarabine was significantly higher in the group of patients who achieved remission in comparison to the group with no response to purine analogues therapy. Interestingly, we observed that among the patients who did not respond to chemotherapy, the presence of del17p and del11q was detected only once. Other non-responders had no detectable genetic abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, it can be presumed that in vitro drug sensitivity test, which is easy to perform, may predict the outcome of fludarabine-based chemotherapy in CLL patients.
