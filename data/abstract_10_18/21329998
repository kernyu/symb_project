Aim of the work was to design a polynucleotide based DNA microarray as screening tool to detect genes in food associated coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS). A focus was laid on genes with potential health concern and technological relevance. The microarray contained 220 probes for genes encoding antibiotic resistances, hemolysins, toxins, amino acid decarboxylases (e.g. biogenic amine formation), binding proteins to extracellular matrix (ECM), lipases, proteases, stress response factors, or nitrate dissimilation. Hybridization of genomic DNA isolated from 32 phenotypically characterized CNS permitted to detect numerous genes, corresponding with the phenotype. However, numerous hybridization signals were obtained for genes without any detectable phenotype. The antibiotic resistance genes blaZ, lnuA, and tetK involved in ss-lactam, lincomycin and tetracycline resistance, respectively, were rarely identified in CNS, however, all species contained some strains with such resistance genes. Decarboxylase genes involved in biogenic amine formation were detected regularly in Staphylococcus carnosus, S. condimenti, S. piscifermentans and S. equorum, but was rarely correlated with the phenotype. The same applied for the fibrinogen (clf) and fibronectin (fbp) binding protein genes, whose phenotype (binding assay) was only correlated in S. equorum and Staphylococcus succinus. Although some CNS showed hemolytic activity and enterotoxin production (Immunoblot) the corresponding genes could not be verified. Technological relevant genes such as proteases or lipases revealed good hybridization signals. In addition, genes involved in nitrate dissimilation (nre, nar, nir), catalase (kat), or superoxide dismutase (sod) were well detected. Interestingly, genes involved in dissimilatory nitrate reduction were more prevalent in strains of S. carnosus, S. condimenti and S. piscifermentans than of S. equorum, S. succinus and S. xylosus.
