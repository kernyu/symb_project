The aim of the current study was to detect coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) in raw milk and cheeses produced in North Italy, and to analyze isolates for their biodiversity, safety aspects and technological properties. Molecular identification methods revealed a high biodiversity among isolates and assigned them to 17 species. The most recovered species were Staphylococcus equorum (12%), Staphylococcus lentus (12%), Staphylococcus simulans (12%), Staphylococcus sciuri (10%), and Staphylococcus xylosus (9%). The presence of ten transferable antibiotic resistance (AR) genes was verified by PCR and 19% of isolates were positive, with tet(K) being the most frequent gene (10%); interestingly, no strain carried multiple AR genes. Twenty-four isolates displayed hemolytic activity; tyrosine decarboxylase gene (tdcA) was found in two isolates, while histidine decarboxylase gene (hdcA) and enterotoxin genes (se) were not detected. Isolates were further characterized for the presence of some relevant technological properties; 16% of isolates displayed proteolytic activity and 39% lipolytic activity, while no one of the isolates was found to exhibit antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus. This study provided evidence of a low occurrence of safety hazards in CNS isolated from dairy products.
