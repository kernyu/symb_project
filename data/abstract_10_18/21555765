JNJ-Q2 is a broad-spectrum bactericidal fluoroquinolone with potent activity against Gram-positive and -negative pathogens. In this study, the in vitro activity of JNJ-Q2 was evaluated against 511 selected Staphylococcus aureus samples isolated in 2008-2009 from patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections in the United States by using reference methodology. JNJ-Q2 was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested overall (MIC(50) and MIC(90), 0.12 and 0.5 mug/ml, respectively) and against methicillin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant subgroups in direct comparisons to moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin (each being >/= 16-fold less potent than JNJ-Q2).
