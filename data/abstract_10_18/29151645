Resurgence of sensitivity of the antibiotics, to which the pathogen had developed resistance in the past, requires special attention for strengthening the reservoir of antimicrobial compounds. Reports in the recent past have suggested that co-trimoxazole (COT) has regained its activity against methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The present study exploited the use of COT in the presence of an antimicrobial peptide (AMP), cryptdin-2 (a murine Paneth cell alpha defensin), in order to reduce the selective pressure of the antibiotic on the pathogen. In vitro antibacterial activity and in vivo efficacy of the combination was ascertained against MRSA induced systemic infection using a murine model. Observations of the present study might help in restoring the regained activity of conventional antibiotics, such as COT, when used in combination with novel antimicrobial molecules like AMPs. This might prove as a viable strategy to eliminate the chances of re-occurrence of resistance due to their multi-prong targeting and synergistically combating infections caused by these resistant pathogens.
