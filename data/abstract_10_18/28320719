Cytoplasmic peptidoglycan (PG) precursor levels were determined in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) after exposure to several cell wall-targeting antibiotics. Three experiments were performed: (i) exposure to 4x MIC levels (acute); (ii) exposure to sub-MIC levels (subacute); (iii) a time course experiment of the effect of vancomycin. In acute exposure experiments, fosfomycin increased UDP-GlcNAc, as expected, and resulted in substantially lower levels of total UDP-linked metabolite accumulation relative to other pathway inhibitors, indicating reduced entry into this pathway. Upstream inhibitors (fosfomycin, d-cycloserine, or d-boroalanine) reduced UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide levels by more than fourfold. Alanine branch inhibitors (d-cycloserine and d-boroalanine) reduced d-Ala-d-Ala levels only modestly (up to 4-fold) but increased UDP-MurNAc-tripeptide levels up to 3,000-fold. Downstream pathway inhibitors (vancomycin, bacitracin, moenomycin, and oxacillin) increased UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide levels up to 350-fold and UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala levels up to 80-fold, suggesting reduced MurD activity by downstream inhibitor action. Sub-MIC exposures demonstrated effects even at 1/8x MIC which strongly paralleled acute exposure changes. Time course data demonstrated that UDP-linked intermediate levels respond rapidly to vancomycin exposure, with several intermediates increasing three- to sixfold within minutes. UDP-linked intermediate level changes were also multiphasic, with some increasing, some decreasing, and some increasing and then decreasing. The total (summed) UDP-linked intermediate pool increased by 1,475 muM/min during the first 10 min after vancomycin exposure, providing a revised estimate of flux in this pathway during logarithmic growth. These observations outline the complexity of PG precursor response to antibiotic exposure in MRSA and indicate likely sites of regulation (entry and MurD).
