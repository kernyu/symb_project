To gain insight into the genomic diversity of Staphylococcus aureus associated with diseases in domestic poultry, 131 isolates from clinically ill turkeys (n=80) and chickens (n = 51) were collected and genotyped using microarray hybridisations. MRSA isolates were subjected to spa and dru typing and their antimicrobial resistance geno- and phenotypes were determined. Most (68 out of 80) turkey isolates belonged to the clonal complex (CC) 398. Seventeen of the 80 isolates (21.2%) were MRSA. The most common MRSA type among turkeys was CC398-MRSA-V (n = 8), but CC5-MRSA-III (n = 4), CC9-MRSA-IV (n = 2), CC398-MRSA-IV (n = 2) and a single CC398-MRSA with an unidentified/truncated SCCmec element were also found. Among the chicken isolates, CC5 predominated (44 out of 51). Five of the chicken isolates were MRSA (9.8%), all belonging to CC398-MRSA-V. These data show that the current dissemination of livestock-associated MRSA also engulfs chickens and turkeys, and that MRSA surveillance among these species is warranted.
