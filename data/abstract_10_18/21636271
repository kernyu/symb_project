We investigated some pyrrolobenzoxazepinone (PBOs, 3e-i) analogues of early described effective non-nucleoside inhibitors of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). Enzymological studies of 3e-i enantiomers, with wild type (wt) RT and some drug-resistant mutants, revealed a stereoselective mode of action and selectivity for RT ternary complex. Unexpectedly (+)-3g was found more potent towards the L100I mutant than towards the wt RT, whereas (+)-3h inhibited the K103N mutant and RT wt with comparable potency.
