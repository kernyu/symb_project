Few labs isolate and perform susceptibility tests on anaerobes; therefore, we studied the differences between 1185 anaerobes isolated from complicated intra-abdominal infections and 470 isolated from moderate to severe diabetic foot infections. They differed markedly in the distribution of species, including Bacteroides fragilis and anaerobic Gram-positive cocci, as well as in resistance patterns, especially to fluoroquinolones.
