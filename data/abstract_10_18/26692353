BACKGROUND: This study used the GenoType(R) MTBDRsl assay (MTBDRsl, Hain Lifescience, Nehren, Germany), an assay for anti-tuberculosis drug susceptibility testing, for the detection of resistance of 40 tuberculosis strains to fluroquinolones (FLQ), injectable drugs (amikacin or capreomycin) and ethambutol to identify multi-drug resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis patients previously identified by solid drug susceptibility test (DST). METHODS: These tuberculosis strains were analysed by both DNA sequencing and conventional drug susceptibility testing on solid medium. RESULTS: The overall agreement rates of the MTBDRsl assay and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing for the detection of ofloxacin (OXF), moxifloxacin (MXF), amikacin (AMK), capreomycin (CPM) and ethambutol (EMB) susceptibility in clinical strains were 87.5% (35/40), 87.5% (35/40), 97.5% (39/40), 60.0% (24/40) and 65.0% (26/40), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study reconfirmed 37 extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis strains using the MTBDRsl assay and these strains were verified by phenotypic drug susceptibility testing. After identification with the MTBDRsl assay, the results were analysed by DNA sequencing with specific primers. From the various mutations identified in the DNA sequencing results, this study found new mutations that characterised EMB-resistant strains, namely, R507K and G406T mutations, which had not been previously reported.
