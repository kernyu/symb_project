Of 608 Streptococcus pneumoniae clinical strains isolated at a hospital in South Korea during 2009-2014, sixteen (2.6%) were identified as levofloxacin resistant. The predominant serotype was 11A (9 isolates). Two novel sequence types of multidrug-resistant S. pneumoniae with serotype 11A were identified, indicating continuous diversification of resistant strains.
