Although the ever-growing usage of antimicrobials in the fields of medicine, pharmacology, and microbiology have undoubtedly allowed for unprecedented advances in the scientific world, these advances are nevertheless accompanied by unprecedented challenges. Sharp increases in antibiotic usages have led to inefficient and wasteful usage practices. Bacterial resistances have dramatically increased and therefore hindered the effectiveness of traditional antibiotics, thus forcing many life-science professionals to turn to plant extracts and synthetic chemicals [1]. The Antimicrobial Index (TAMI) seeks to alleviate some of these mounting difficulties through the collection and centralization of relevant antimicrobial susceptibility data from journals. Data compiled for antimicrobials include: method of action, physical properties, resistance genes, side effects, and minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC50, MIC90 and/or ranges). TAMI currently contains data on 960 antimicrobials and over 24,000 microorganisms (3,500 unique strains) which were collected from over 400 pieces of published literature. Volume and scope of the index have been and will continue to increase and it is hoped that such an index will further foster international cooperation and communication of antimicrobial-related knowledge.
