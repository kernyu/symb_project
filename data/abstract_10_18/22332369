The structure of neuraminidase of the type A influenza virus (H1N1) spreading in the human population was analyzed. The obtained results indicate a significant correlation between the oseltamivir sensitivity and the nature of the amino acid localized not only to neuraminidase position 274, but also to position 273 of this protein. Phenylalanine at position 273 in neuraminidase indicates a higher propensity to influenza virus mutation H274Y, leading to the appearance of resistant strains. It is suggested that the mutation at position 273 may be one of the characteristics allowing type A influenza virus to be ascribed to a pandemic or a seasonal type.
