Data on non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) infection in South Asia are limited. We used data gathered prospectively from 1996 to 2011 as part of a hospital surveillance system in Dhaka, Bangladesh, to identify diarrheal patients with NTS isolated from stool. NTS was isolated in 1.3% (468 of 37,439) of diarrheal patients; 47% of total cases of NTS were in children < 5 years of age, although older adults (>/= 60 years) had the highest isolation rates. NTS isolation peaked in the monsoon months of July and August. Over the study period, rates of multidrug resistance decreased, whereas rates of decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin increased. Compared with control patients, NTS patients were older and wealthier; however, no differences in type of housing or exposure to animals were found. NTS patients had increased inflammatory cells in stool and required more fluid resuscitation.
