Pathogenic fungi are one of the main causes of hospital-related infections. Since conventional antifungals have become less effective because of the increasing fungal resistance to the standard drugs, the need for new agents is becoming urgent. Herein we report a synthesis of a series of novel N-[imino-(1-oxo-(1H)-phthalazin-2-yl)methyl]-benzenesulfonamide derivatives with in vitro activity against yeast-like fungi isolated from the oral cavity and respiratory tract of patients with candidiasis. These compounds were synthesized by the one-step or two-step reactions of 1-(2-alkylthiobenzensulfonyl)-2-aminoguanidines with the appropriate ortho-carbonyl benzoic acids. The biological study revealed that new derivatives have shown significant growth-inhibitory activity, superior or comparable, than those of the reference drug fluconazole. The most promising activities were observed against Candida albicans, with inhibition at least 1-3 (12.5%-37.5%) of the eight tested strains at the low MIC level of </=6.2-25 microg/mL.
