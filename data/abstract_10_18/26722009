The open process used to ferment sugar cane juice or molasses to produce ethanol fuel is prone to contamination by bacterial cells of different species, in particular Lactobacilli. The situation can be exacerbated by the emergence of resistant cells to industrial antibiotics that are normally used to combat this contamination. In this work, two Lactobacillus vini isolates from ethanol distilleries were identified and found to be resistant to doxycycline, a tetracycline derivative, although sensitive to other antibiotics tested. The identification of these isolates was confirmed by sequencing the pheS gene and their clonal origin was shown by PCR-fingerprinting analysis. Moreover, the isolates were shown to carry the transposable element Tn916 that harboured the tet-M gene. Furthermore, conjugation experiments showed that both isolates were capable of transferring this element, and as a result, the tet-M gene, to Enterococcus faecalis reference strain. Finally, the identification of tetracycline resistance in the same distilleries in other Lactobacilli, suggested that inter-species transfer of antibiotic resistance may be occurring in the industrial environment, and thus impairing the efficiency of the antibiotic treatment and causing serious health concerns.
