Treatment of invasive Candida krusei infections can be difficult due to its intrinsic fluconazole resistance and its reduced susceptibility to amphotericin B and flucytosine. Caspofungin (CAS) acts on a different cellular target, and its combination with voriconazole (VOR) or amphotericin B (AmB) appears promising. We evaluated the activity of CAS, VOR and AmB alone and in combination at 1/4, 1, 4xMIC concentrations by time-kill method against 30 C. krusei isolates. All isolates were susceptible to CAS and VOR; AmB MICs were 2 mug/ml for 50% of isolates by broth microdilution. CAS showed a fast killing activity at all concentrations; it was fungistatic at 1/4xMICs and fungicidal at 1-4xMICs in general. VOR displayed a concentration-independent fungistatic activity against all isolates. AmB exhibited a concentration-dependent activity; it was fungistatic at 1/4-1xMIC and fungicidal at 4xMIC. The most common interaction was indifference for both combinations. Frequency of synergic interaction for the VOR + CAS combination was 66.7% at 1/4xMIC after 48 h. The best results for CAS + AmB combination were obtained at 4xMIC in the first 4-8 h; synergic interaction was detected for 20 isolates (66.7%) at 4xMIC after 4 h. Consequently, VOR and CAS alone have been found effective, and high AmB MICs are remarkable against clinical C. krusei isolates in vitro. The combinations of CAS with VOR or AmB have exhibited promising results.
