The global propagation of environmental biocontaminants such as antibiotic resistant pathogens and their antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) is a public health concern that highlights the need for improved monitoring strategies. Here, we demonstrate the environmental stability and applicability of an oligonucleotide-functionalized gold nanosensor. The mecA ARG was targeted as model biocontaminant due to its presence in clinically-relevant pathogens and to its emergence as an environmental contaminant. mecA-specific nanosensors were tested for antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) detection in ARG-spiked effluent from four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The mecA-specific nanosensors showed stability in environmental conditions and in high ionic strength ([MgCl2]<50mM), and high selectivity against mismatched targets. Spectrophotometric detection was reproducible with an LOD of 70pM ( approximately 4x10(7)genes/muL), even in the presence of interferences associated with non-target genomic DNA and complex WWTP effluent. This contribution supports the environmental applicability of a new line of cost-effective, field-deployable tools needed for wide-scale biocontaminant monitoring.
