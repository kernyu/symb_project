Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection kills two million people every year, and the chemotherapy has led to significant amount of drug resistance. Signal transduction systems are used by bacteria to survive or adapt to their living environment, but the relationship to drug resistance is not well understood. In this article, we introduced the two-component signal transduction systems of M. tuberculosis and analyzed their relationship with drug resistance. We identified five two-component system pairs involved in the formation of drug resistance. Therefore, these two-component systems are good targeting sites for small biochemical drugs to target so as to reverse the drug resistance and virulence.
