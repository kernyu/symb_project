INTRODUCTION: Dual antiviral therapy with pegylated interferon alfa-2a and ribavirin leads do sustained elimination of hepatitis C virus infection in over 50% patients with genotypes 1 and 4 and in over 80% with genotypes 2 and 3. In addition to genotype, for predicting success of therapy, important factors are baseline HCV RNA level, age, sex, stage of fibrosis, insulin resistance, degree of fat in liver, and patient's weight and genetics. Also, adherence to therapy could be a very important factor associated with success of therapy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess importance of therapy adherence and reduced doses of pegylated interferon alfa-2a and ribavirin on sustained virological response. METHODS: One hundred and sixteen patients with chronic hepatitis C were analyzed. Sustained virological response was analyzed in relation to whether the patients received a full cumulative dose of pegylated interferon alfa-2a, a full cumulative dose of pegylated interferon alfa-2a and ribavirin, and a full cumulative dose of pegylated interferon alfa-2a and at least 60% the expected cumulative dose of ribavirin. RESULTS: At the end of the follow-up period, sustained virological response was achieved in 26 (96.3%) patients who received full cumulative dose of pegylated interferon alfa-2a and in 66 (74.2%) who did not (p < 0.05). Sustained virological response was achieved in 18 (94.7%) patients who received full cumulative dose of pegylated inteferon alfa-2a and ribavirin, and in 73 (76%) who did not (p < 0.05). Sustained virological response was achieved in 25 (96.2%) patients who received full cumulative dose of pegylated inteferon alfa-2a and at least 60% of cumulative dose of ribavirin and in 66 (74.2%) who did not (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that adherence to therapy for chronic hepatitis C is a very important factor for achieving sustained virological response.
