In transplant recipients, drug-resistant human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infections remain a serious problem. Drug-resistance against ganciclovir (GCV), cidofovir (CDV) and foscarnet (PFA) is caused by mutations either in the phosphotransferase-gene (UL97) or in the viral polymerase (UL54). For characterization of newly emerging mutations marker transfer analysis is required. Two new HCMV-mutations, the UL54-mutation L516M and the UL97-mutation A613V, were characterized by this method.
