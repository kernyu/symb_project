OBJECTIVE: To study the in vivo efficacy of these two ACTs in the treatment of Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum malaria) in Kolkata and to determine the prevalence of mutant S769N codon of the PfATPase6 gene among field isolates of P. falciparum collected from the study area. METHODS: A total of 207P. falciparum positive cases were enrolled randomly in two study arms and followed up for 42 days as per WHO (2009) protocol. A portion of PfATPase6 gene spanning codon S769N was amplified and sequenced by direct sequencing method. RESULTS: It was observed that the efficacy of both the ACT regimens were highly effective in the study area and no mutant S769N was detected from any isolate. CONCLUSIONS: The used, combination AS+SP is effective and the other combination AM+LF might be an alternative, if needed.
