The outcome of patients with aspergilloma undergoing lung transplantation is not completely known, but anecdotal reports of poor outcome after transplant have discouraged this practice. We present a 45-year-old female with pulmonary sarcoidosis complicated by bilateral pulmonary and sinus aspergillomas who underwent successful double lung transplantation. Patients with aspergillomas can receive lung transplantation, provided that there is sufficient technical expertise to explant the infected lungs with minimal chance of chest wall contamination, and aggressive antifungal therapy is used post transplantation.
