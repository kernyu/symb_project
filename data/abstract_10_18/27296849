Enrofloxacin (ENX) has been widely used in the prevention and control of bacterial diseases in sturgeon aquaculture due to its characteristics of wide antibacterial spectrum, strong antibacterial activity, less toxicity and fewer side effects, rapid action, extensive in vivo distribution, and little cross-resistance with other antibiotics. However, the spinal abnormality was found in Acipenser baerii soon after ENX administration, which resulted an "S"-shaped curvature of the spine and retarded fish growth. It was still not clear whether ENX could cause spinal abnormality in sturgeons by now. The aim of this work was to determine the accumulation rule and toxicity of ENX to A. baerii when used at a high dose and/or unusually long durations. Here, ENX was orally given to A. baerii for 3-5 d continuously at the dosage of 0, 20, 40, and 80 mg/kg once daily, respectively. The accumulation of ENX in blood, liver, kidney, and cartilage was detected after withdrawal, and the tissues were made into sections for morphological examination. The results showed that the levels of ENX increased in the four tissues with the increase of dose and duration, and the ENX level in serum was far lower than that in other tissues. At 240 h, ENX levels in the four tissues decreased significantly. The histology indicated that the liver, kidney, and cartilage began to show structural damages at 5 d after withdrawal of 40 mg/kg ENX. The damage was aggravated at 3-5 d after withdrawal of 80 mg/kg ENX. At 240 h, the damaged tissues showed signs of recovery. These results suggested that ENX should be no more than 40 mg/kg and that exposure time should not be greater than 5 d to prevent liver, kidney, and cartilage damage. More attention should be paid to the impact of ENX on the occurrence and development of chondrocytes in juvenile A. baerii and the potential damage to the cartilage.
