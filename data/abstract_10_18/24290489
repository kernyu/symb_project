Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) has emerged as a highly drug-resistant small animal veterinary pathogen. Although often isolated from outpatients in veterinary clinics, there is concern that MRSP follows a veterinary-hospital-associated epidemiology. This study's objective was to identify risk factors for MRSP infections in dogs and cats in Germany. Clinical isolates of MRSP cases (n=150) and methicillin-susceptible S. pseudintermedius (MSSP) controls (n=133) and their corresponding host signalment and medical data covering the six months prior to staphylococcal isolation were analysed by multivariable logistic regression. The identity of all MRSP isolates was confirmed through demonstration of S. intermedius-group specific nuc and mecA. In the final model, cats (compared to dogs, OR 18.5, 95% CI 1.8-188.0, P=0.01), animals that had been hospitalised (OR 104.4, 95% CI 21.3-511.6, P<0.001), or visited veterinary clinics more frequently (>10 visits OR 7.3, 95% CI 1.0-52.6, P=0.049) and those that had received topical ear medication (OR 5.1, 95% CI 1.8-14.9, P=0.003) or glucocorticoids (OR 22.5, 95% CI 7.0-72.6, P<0.001) were at higher risk of MRSP infection, whereas S. pseudintermedius isolates from ears were more likely to belong to the MSSP-group (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.03-0.34, P<0.001). These results indicate an association of MRSP infection with veterinary clinic/hospital settings and possibly with chronic skin disease. There was an unexpected lack of association between MRSP and antimicrobial therapy; this requires further investigation but may indicate that MRSP is well adapted to canine skin with little need for selective pressure.
