BACKGROUND: Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is one of the leading causes of watery diarrhea among children. METHODS: In this study EPEC isolates from the pediatric population of Pakistan (2010-2012) were subjected to phylotyping, antibiotic susceptibility, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) profiling and evaluation of one representative strain from each panel of phylotypesin Galleria mellonella, infection model. RESULTS: A total of 46/225 (20.4%) stool samples were positive for EPEC. Isolates mainly belong to D phylogroup (18, 39%) followed by nontypeable (10, 22%), B1 (9, 20%), B2 (8, 17%) and A (1, 2%). High resistance was observed for ampicillin (42, 91%), erythromycin (41, 89%), cefaclor (37, 80%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (36, 78%), tetracycline (36, 78%). Among nalidixic acid resistant isolates 13 (28%) showed presence of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in parC (C330-T330) whereas 1 (2%) isolate showed gyrB (A660-T660) SNP. Furthermore, 27 (59%) isolates were ESBL producers. Representative isolates of phlyotypes A and B2 showed enhance killing of G. mellonella compared to ones belonging to phylotypes B1 and D. CONCLUSIONS: Non-typeable EPEC strains were frequently observed. ESBL production in ESBL producers was found to be plasmid mediated. No significant association of antibiotic resistance profile with specific phylogroup of EPEC was found, however G. mellonella infection model differentiated representative phylotypes.
