A novel targeted massive parallel sequencing approach identified genetic variation in eight known or predicted fimbrial adhesins for 46 Salmonella strains. The results highlight associations between specific adhesin alleles, host species, and antimicrobial resistance. The differentiation of allelic variants has potential applications for diagnostic microbiology and epidemiological investigations.
