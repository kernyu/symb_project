The clinical management of prosthetic joint infections and other persistent bacterial infections represents a major unmet medical need. The rifamycins are one of the most potent antibiotic classes against persistent bacterial infections, but bacteria can develop resistance to rifamycins rapidly and the clinical utility of the rifamycin class is typically limited to antibiotic combinations to minimize the development of resistance. To develop a better therapy against persistent bacterial infections, a series of rifamycin based bifunctional molecules were designed, synthesized, and evaluated with the goal to identify a dual-acting drug that maintains the potent activity of rifamycins against persistent pathogens and at the same time minimize the development of rifamycin resistance. TNP-2092 was identified as a drug candidate and is currently in an early stage of clinical development for the treatment of prosthetic joint infections.
