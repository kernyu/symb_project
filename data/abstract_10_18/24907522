OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of SLPI on the growth and biological processes of Candida albicans. METHODS: Two C. albicans strains were used in this study, a clinical isolate resistant to fluconazole (PRI) and a reference strain ATCC 24433. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined according to the CLSI methodology. The influence of SLPI on secreted serine proteinase activities (SSP) was measured by the cleavage of specific substrate, and surface hydrophobicity was determined by the aqueous-hydrocarbon biphasic separation method. Flow cytometry was performed to investigate receptors for SLPI and variations in the cell wall mannoprotein expression. Interaction between yeast and epithelium was assessed using the MA-104 cells lineage. Ultrastructure was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). RESULTS: MIC values were calculated as 18 and 18.9muM for the PRI and ATCC 24433, respectively. SSP activity was reduced by 48.8% by 18muM of SLPI and cell surface hydrophobicity increased by 11.1%. Flow cytometry suggest the existence of SLPI binding sites on the surface of the yeast. Results showed a reduction in the expression of mannoproteins in 20.8% by the cells treated with 80muM of SLPI, and 18muM reduced the adhesion of yeasts to mammalian cells in 60.1%. TEM revealed ultrastructural changes in cells treated with 80muM of SLPI, such as the presence of membrane-like structures within the cytoplasm. CONCLUSIONS: SLPI exerts a significant influence on C. albicans viability and biological processes. Considering its constitutive and physiologic features, SLPI may become a promising tool for the development of new methodologies for the treatment and control of candidiasis.
