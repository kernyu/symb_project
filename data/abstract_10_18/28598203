In this study, we investigated the prevalence and fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance mechanisms in Escherichia coli isolated from swine fecal samples. E. coli isolates were collected from 171 (72.2%) of 237 swine fecal samples. Of these, 59 isolates (34.5%) were confirmed as FQ-resistant E. coli by the disk diffusion method. Of the FQ-resistant isolates, three major FQ resistance mechanisms were investigated. Of the 59 isolates, plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes were detected in 9 isolates (15.3%). Efflux pump activity was found in 56 isolates (94.9%); however, this was not correlated with the increased FQ resistance measured by determining the MIC. Point mutations in quinolone resistance-determining regions were the main cause of FQ resistance. All 59 ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates had mutations in quinolone resistance-determining regions; of these 59 isolates, all (100%) had mutations in gyrA, 58 (98.3%) had mutations in parC, 22 (37.3%) had mutations in parE, and none had mutations in gyrB. The predominant mutation type was double mutation in gyrA (Ser83Leu plus mutation in aspartic acid 87), and all FQ-resistant isolates (except one) that had mutations in parC or parE also had double mutations in gyrA. Importantly, the frequencies of multidrug-resistant and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli were significantly higher in the high ciprofloxacin MIC group in this study. Compared with previous studies in Korea, the prevalence of FQ resistance and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes had increased considerably in swine. Although the use of FQ as a feed additive is prohibited in Korea, use for self-treatment and therapeutic purposes has been increasing, which may be responsible for the higher FQ resistance rate observed in this study. Therefore, prudent use of FQ on animal farms is warranted to reduce the evolution of FQ-resistant bacteria in the animal industry.
