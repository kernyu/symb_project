The class A beta-lactamase FTU-1 produces resistance to penicillins and ceftazidime but not to any other beta-lactam antibiotics tested. FTU-1 hydrolyzes penicillin antibiotics with catalytic efficiencies of 10(5) to 10(6) M(-1) s(-1) and cephalosporins and carbapenems with catalytic efficiencies of 10(2) to 10(3) M(-1) s(-1), but the monobactam aztreonam and the cephamycin cefoxitin are not substrates for the enzyme. FTU-1 shares 21 to 34% amino acid sequence identity with other class A beta-lactamases and harbors two cysteine residues conserved in all class A carbapenemases. FTU-1 is the first weak class A carbapenemase that is native to Francisella tularensis.
