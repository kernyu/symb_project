The antimicrobial activity of one 3-hydroxypyridin-4-one (HPO) hexadentate (1) and three HPO hexadentate-based dendrimeric chelators (2-4) was evaluated. They were found to exhibit marked inhibitory effect on the growth of two Gram-positive bacteria and two Gram-negative bacteria. The combination treatment of dendrimeric chelator 2 with norfloxacin against Staphyloccocus aureus and Escherichia coli showed a dramatic synergistic bactericidal effect. As the dendrimeric chelator has a large molecular weight, its combination with norfloxacin may find application in the treatment of external infections.
