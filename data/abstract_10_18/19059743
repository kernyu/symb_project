OBJECTIVES: This study had for objective to assess the frequency of resistance to fluoroquinolones and to third generation cephalosporin in E. coli isolated from urines of consulting and hospitalized patients and to detect the rate of multiresistant E. coli strains. DESIGN: A retrospective survey was made over 3 years (1(st) January 2005 to 31(st) December 2007). Eight hundred and nineteen patients presented with UTI confirmed in the Rabat Cheikh Zayd Teaching Hospital. RESULTS: E. coli was the etiologic agent in 57% of reported UTI. The frequency of E. coli resistance to fluoroquinolones was 27% with a higher rate among hospitalized patients. We found that ten E. coli strains were producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and resistant to aminosides and fluoroquinolones. CONCLUSIONS: The resistance of E. coli to fluoroquinolones is becoming worrying among consulting and hospitalized patients. Ten strains multiresistant to fluoroquinolones and third generation cephalosporins, probably because of plasmids, were isolated. This increasingly frequent resistance mechanism should lead to a more careful use of first line fluoroquinolones for UTI.
