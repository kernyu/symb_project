We report a case of a patient suffering from multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis (MDR-PTB) who later developed an invasive infection of the respiratory tract with a rapidly growing non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), recently identified as Mycobacterium massiliense, closely related to M. abscessus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of M. massiliense infection being reported from India.
