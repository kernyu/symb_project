We describe the first known report of a VIM1 metallo-beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumonia outside Europe - confirmed by our colleagues in Canada. The patient had no travel history and surveillance failed to identify additional cases. The importance of health care professionals being diligent in identifying these multi-drug resistant isolates is emphasised.
