A herd-based survey of Salmonella in pigs was carried in a major pig producing region of Spain. Mesenteric lymph nodes were collected from the carcasses of 25 pigs from each of 80 herds at time of slaughter. Salmonella spp. were isolated from 31% of animals and 94% of herds. Within-herd prevalence ranged from 4 to 88%, with the prevalence in most herds being greater than 10%. A large diversity of Salmonella serotypes was found, with Typhimurium, 4,[5],12:i:-, and Rissen being the most prevalent. Two or more serotypes coexisted in 73% of the herds. Salmonella Typhimurium was present in 68% of the herds. Most (82%) of the Salmonella isolates belonged to serogroups targeted by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests for pig salmonellosis. Resistance to at least one antimicrobial agent was detected in 73% of the strains, and one or more resistant strains were recovered from pigs in 93% of the herds. Antimicrobial agent resistance (AR) was more frequent among the most prevalent than it was among the rarer serotypes. Twenty-five multi-AR patterns were found. Resistance to three or more families of antimicrobial agents was found in 75% of AR strains. The finding that many of the herds yielded isolates of several multi-AR patterns indicates that Salmonella infections were acquired from multiple sources. High prevalence of Salmonella in herds was associated with lack of rodent control programs, herds from farms with only finishing pigs, herds managed by more than one full-time worker, herds for which the source of drinking water was not a city supply, and relatively long fattening times.
