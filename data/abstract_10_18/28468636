BACKGROUND: The epidemiology of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolated in horse infections is not well documented, especially in France. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of MRSA isolates in horse infections from 2007 to 2013 in France and to characterize phenotypically and genotypically this collection. RESULTS: Out of 1393 S. aureus horse isolates, 85 (6.1%) were confirmed to be MRSA. Interestingly, the prevalence of MRSA significantly increased from 2007-2009 to 2010-2013 (0.7 vs. 9.5%, P <0.0001). Resistance to methicillin was due to the presence of the mecA gene in 84 strains (98.8%) while one strain (1.2%) possessed the mecC gene. The vast majority of the strains (83/85, 97.6%) was resistant to at least three different classes of antibiotics. Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) showed that MRSA strains belonged mainly since not all belong to two sequence types (STs): ST398 (53/85, 62.4%) and ST8 (28/85, 32.9%). It is worth to note that all ST398 MRSA isolates were detected in the period 2010-2013. Other molecular typing methods were also used, such SCC mec analysis, spa typing and rep-PCR (Diversilab, bioMerieux). All these four techniques were in good agreement, with spa typing and rep-PCR being more discriminative than MLST and SCC mec typing. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first epidemiological study in France with extensive characterization of MRSA isolates associated with horse infections in stud farms. It shows that there is a significant increase of MRSA prevalence between 2007 and 2013, which mainly results from the spread of ST398 clones. It also highlights the importance of horses as a potential reservoir of important antimicrobial resistance genes.
