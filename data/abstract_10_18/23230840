Over 450 peer-reviewed papers containing the keyword Aspergillus fumigatus were published in 2011. Although this method may be an impossible task, I have selected three clusters of papers describing exciting recent advances in research on A. fumigatus. The first is the novel approach of in vivo imagining of experimental aspergillosis by the use of (68) Ga-labeled siderophores, internalized by the fungus, and detected via positron emission tomography to image the site infection. This work may lead to improved diagnosis of aspergillosis. The second important finding is that NK lymphocytes, not thought to be involved in host resistance to aspergillosis, can kill aspergilli through direct contact, either through perforin or interferon-gamma, or both. The third area pertains to a novel first-in-class antifungal drug, E1210 (Eisai), which inhibits GPI anchoring of fungal-associated cell wall proteins. Thus far, it shows promising in vitro activity against a broad range of fungi including Aspergilli, as well as those that are difficult to treat with currently available therapies. Overall, these three areas demonstrate the exciting promise, progress, and utility of basic research against A. fumigatus.
