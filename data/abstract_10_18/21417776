BACKGROUND: There is the need to properly characterize the temporal trend of U.S. Staphylococcus aureus infections, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and community-acquired (CA) MRSA in inpatient and outpatient settings. METHODS: The study used the Surveillance Network((R)) surveillance database (Eurofins Medinet) and the National Hospitalization Discharge Survey for the period 1998-2007. CA-MRSA phenotype was defined by a resistance profile that includes susceptibility to gentamicin and cotrimoxazole, and coresistance to ciprofloxacin/clindamycin. Adjusted rates, rate ratios, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: The study consisted of 1,761,991 S. aureus isolates. Annual MRSA prevalence continuously increased over the 10-year period from 32.7% in 1998 to 53.8% in 2007 (odds ratio 2.4, 95% CI 2.3-2.5). CA-MRSA replaced competing strains by increasing its share of MRSA from 22.3% in 1998 to 66.1% in 2007 (odds ratio 6.7, 95% CI 6.5-6.9). MRSA-related hospitalization rate per 1,000 discharges doubled from 3.5 +/- 0.9 in 1998 to 7.6 +/- 1.5 in 2007 (RR 2.2, 95% CI 1.8-3.1), whereas CA-MRSA increased from 0.4 +/- 0.14 hospitalizations per 1,000 discharges in 1998 to 3.1 +/- 0.5 in 2007 (RR 8.1, 95% CI 5.2-14.1), By 2007, 81.5% of all MRSA isolates were categorized as CA-MRSA among children, whereas CA-MRSA represented 48.9% of MRSA isolates from the elderly. CONCLUSION: MRSA not only replaced methicillin susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates as a percentage of all S. aureus isolates, but its hospitalization rates increased over and above the replacement process. This trend also applies to CA-MRSA over hospital-acquired (HA) MRSA.
