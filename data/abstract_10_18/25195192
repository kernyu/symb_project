The main purpose of the research was to determine if three weekly samplings would produce consistent results for low strongyle egg shedders, generally associated with older horses. Strongyle egg counts per gram of feces (EPG) were done for 661 Thoroughbred mares on 14 farms in 2012-2013 once a week for three consecutive weeks. None of the mares had been treated with ivermectin or moxidectin for more than 90 days and with fenbendazole, oxibendazole, or pyrantel pamoate for more than 60 days. Strongyle EPG count data indicated that 38.3% of the mares were positive at first and second sampling, and 37.8%--at third sampling. There were 5.6-63.3% of horses positive per farm. Correlations between EPG count data in all three weeks are quite high (Rs = 0.84, p<0.001). Level of horse infection was found to be dependent on horse age, type of farm and individual characters of horse. This study documented that strongyle egg counts (EPGs) from individual horses did not differ significantly between weeks. Thus, a single strongyle EPG count can be interpreted as indicative of the level of egg shedding for a given horse. These data support the current trend of not deworming all adult horses on a farm, so that high shedders can be identified and treated. This saves horse owners money and reduces development of potential drug resistance of parasites because of less frequent usage of antiparasitic compounds. Information from this study helps to conclude recommendations for parasite control in horses globally.
