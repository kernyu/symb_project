Sixteen isolates of P. aeruginosa were collected from different hospitals in Kahramanmaras among 2006-2007 and tested for the level of resistance to the widely used antipseudomonal antibiotics and used in local midicinal and veterinary practice. The aim of this study was to determine the antibiotic resistance to P. aeruginosa strains isolated in Microbiology Laboratory of different hospitals in Kahramanmaras between 2006-2007. These strains were mostly isolated from urine and few from tracheolaringeal aspirate, tracheal secretion, mucus, bronchoalveolar lavage. The antibiotic resistance rates were as follows: Penicillin (PEN) 100%, Amoxicillin (AMO) 94%, Cefazolin (CEF) 87.5%, Cefoxitin (CEFX) 81%, Nitrofrantoin (NIT) 75%, Chlorampenicol (CHL) 62.5%, Tetracycline (TET) 56%, Ceftriaxone (CEFT) 44%, Oflaxain (OFL) and Gentamycin (GEN) 37.5%, Meropenem (MER) and Streptomycine (STR) 31%. Among 16 isolates of P. aeruginosa from wounds showed 8 (50%) beta-lactamase activity, whereas 8 isolates of P. aeruginosa from urine showed no beta-lactamase activity. All P. aeruginosa strains 16 (100%) isolates showed multiple antibiotic resistance towards three to eleven antibiotics.
