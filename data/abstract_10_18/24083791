The last two decades are characterized by major increases in the incidence of systemic fungal infections caused by the yeast Candida albicans, particularly in immunocompromised patients. On the other hand it was observed the increased number of pathogenic microorganisms with multiple resistance to drugs. Also there is a big variety of drugs for the treatment of candidiasis, only two drugs are used for the treatment of infections from Aspergillus fumigatus. Taking into account that the long term therapy with azoles results in resistance a critical need exists for new antifungal agents with fewer side effecgts to treat these life-threatening fungal infections. This review will cover the advances in research of biological activity of different compounds from different chemical classes with focus on their antifungal properties.
