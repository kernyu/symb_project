Interferons (IFNs) are critically important in the control of influenza A virus infections. To better understand the pathogenic characteristics of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza virus (pH1N1) from an innate immunity viewpoint, we investigated whether in vitro pH1N1 is sensitive to the antiviral activity of IFN beta, leukocyte IFN alpha, and several IFN alpha subtypes in a human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line under single-growth cycle conditions. The results showed that 50% inhibitory concentration values against pH1N1 for various type I IFN preparations were higher than those against the IFN-sensitive encephalomyocarditis virus. Leukocyte IFN alpha and IFN alpha 5, 7, 8, 10, 14, 17, and 21 subtypes also appeared to be less active against pH1N1 than the Puerto Rico/8/34 H1N1 human influenza strain A. Taken together, the results provide new insights into the contributions of the various IFN alpha subtypes toward the regulation of innate immunity against pH1N1.
