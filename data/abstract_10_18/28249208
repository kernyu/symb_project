A new class of diphenylurea was identified as a novel antibacterial scaffold with an antibacterial spectrum that includes highly resistant staphylococcal isolates, namely methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA & VRSA). Starting with a lead compound 3 that carries an aminoguanidine functionality from one side and a n-butyl moiety on the other ring, several analogues were prepared. Considering the pharmacokinetic parameters as a key factor in structural optimization, the structure-activity-relationships (SARs) at the lipophilic side chain were rigorously examined leading to the discovery of the cycloheptyloxyl analogue 21n as a potential drug-candidate. This compound has several notable advantages over vancomycin and linezolid including rapid killing kinetics against MRSA and the ability to target and reduce the burden of MRSA harboring inside immune cells (macrophages). Furthermore, the potent anti-MRSA activity of 21n was confirmed in vivo using a Caenorhabditis elegans animal model. The present study provides a foundation for further development of diphenylurea compounds as potential therapeutic agents to address the burgeoning challenge of bacterial resistance to antibiotics.
