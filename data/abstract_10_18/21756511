SETTING: National tuberculosis (TB) programmes (NTPs) in 100 countries. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relationship between the estimated prevalence of multidrug resistance in previously untreated TB cases and policies regarding sales and distribution of TB drugs, particularly rifampicin (RMP). DESIGN: Questionnaire survey of national TB drug control policies, completed by NTP managers. Results were correlated with recent World Health Organization estimates of prevalence of drug resistance in new cases of TB. RESULTS: Questionnaires were received from 100 countries, including 88 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and 17 of the 22 high-burden countries. Current policies were considered adequate in only 40 of the 88 LMICs (45%). A higher prevalence of multidrug resistance was associated with fewer years of free availability of TB drugs from the NTP (P = 0.02) and more years of availability of RMP from providers or pharmacies outside the NTP (P = 0.02). Eleven of the 20 countries with the highest prevalence of multidrug resistance had inadequate policies governing sales and distribution of TB drugs. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that policies regarding sales and distribution of TB drugs should receive more emphasis as part of the global strategy to control drug resistance.
