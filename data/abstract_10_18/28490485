Studies on Mycoplasma pneumoniae in Thailand have focused on urban centers and have not included molecular characterization. In an attempt to provide a more comprehensive understanding of this organism, we conducted a systematic random sampling to identify 3,000 nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected from January 2009 through July 2012 during population-based surveillance for influenza-like illness in two rural provinces. M. pneumoniae was detected by real-time PCR in 175 (5.8%) specimens. Genotyping was performed using the major adhesion protein (P1) and multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA). Of the 157 specimens typed, 97 were P1 type 1 and 60 were P1 type 2. Six different MLVA profiles were identified in 149 specimens, with 4/5/7/2 (40%) and 3/5/6/2 (26%) predominating. There was no discrete seasonality to M. pneumoniae infections. Examination of the 23S rRNA sequence for known polymorphisms conferring macrolide resistance revealed that all 141 tested to possess the genotype associated with macrolide susceptibility.
