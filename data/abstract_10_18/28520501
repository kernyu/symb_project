The aim of the study was to characterize multidrug-resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli isolates collected in Serbia from bovine clinical mastitis cases and diseased pigs, mainly with molecular methods. A total of 48 E. coli isolates was collected during the years 2013-2014, of which 22 were MDR and were included in further analysis. Phylogenetic typing showed that 17 isolates belonged to group A, while two isolates were classified in group B1 and a single one in group D. All isolates showed unique macrorestriction patterns. Phenotypic susceptibility testing revealed resistances of the isolates against up to 13 antimicrobial agents, including resistance to fluoroquinolones. A wide variety of resistance genes was detected by PCR amplification and sequencing of amplicons. Sequence analysis of the quinolone resistance determining regions of topoisomerase genes revealed mutations in gyrA, parC, and/or parE. Plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes were detected in two porcine (aac-6'-Ib-cr and qnrS, respectively) isolates and a single bovine (aac-6'-Ib-cr) isolate. Resistance genes were found to be located on conjugative plasmids in 16 cases, many of which conferred a multidrug resistance phenotype. In conclusion, the plentitude of resistance genes located on conjugative plasmids and integrons in E. coli from cows and pigs in Vojvodina, Serbia, pose a high risk for horizontal gene transfer in bacteria from livestock husbandry.
