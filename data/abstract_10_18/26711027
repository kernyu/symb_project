The growth promoting effect of the bacterial storage compound poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) has been studied for young fish of high trophic level (European sea bass) and intermediate trophic level (Siberian sturgeon). Here, the effect of PHB on growth, digestive enzyme activities, body composition and diseases resistance of juvenile Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) of low trophic level was investigated. Although dietary PHB supplementation (5, 25 and 50 g PHB kg(-1) formulated semi-purified diet) during 28 days resulted in a trend of increased weight gain, there was no significant difference in the mean final body weight (258-284 mg) when compared to the fish from the control group (on average 218 mg). Lipase activity increased significantly with about 20-40% by the supplementation of PHB in the diet, which may have led to the significant increase in total lipid content with about 10% in the PHB treatment groups. However, the profile of total (n-6) fatty acids (FAs), total monounsaturated FAs and total saturated FAs relative to the total lipid was similar among various PHB treatments. An additional challenge test on gnotobiotic Nile tilapia larvae using the pathogen Edwardsiella ictaluri gly09R showed that feeding challenged larvae with PHB-enriched Artemia nauplii resulted in a 20% higher survival as compared to the challenged control larvae. Overall, it is suggested that the trend of increased body weight gain resulted from intestinal lipid digestion, absorption and deposition and that PHB is effective as an antimicrobial agent for application in Nile tilapia larviculture.
