OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of a line-probe assay delta (LiPA) as rapid diagnostic test for early detection of drug-resistant tuberculosis compared to conventional susceptibility methods in Pakistan. METHODS: Resistance to rifampicin (RIF) and isoniazid (INH) in 108 smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis samples was detected using a line-probe assay [GenoType MTBDRplus (Hain Lifescience, GmbH, Nehren, Germany)] at the clinical microbiology laboratory of Aga Khan University Hospital in May, 2009. Results were compared with susceptibilities performed while using agar proportion. RESULTS: In comparison to the agar proportion method, the detection rate and specificity of resistance using MTBDR plus was 92.5% and 98.2% for rifampicin, and 76.3% and 100% for isoniazid. Mutations in codons 531 and 533 of rpoB gene (62%S531L) were responsible for 67.9% of rifampicin resistance. S315T mutation of katG gene was detected in 55.9% and inhA promoter mutation at positions -15 (C15T) in 11.9% of isoniazid resistant isolates. Four phenotypically rifampicin-resistant and 14 isoniazid-resistant strains were not detected by MTBDRplus. Sequencing these strains revealed mutations in 4 strains; 2 in rpoB gene S531W, del518 and 2 in katG genesW300L, S315N. Hence, two phenotypic rifampicin-resistant and 13 phenotypic isoniazid-resistant strains were not detected by the commercial line probe assay. CONCLUSION: The study showed that MTBDRplus had a high detection rate for rifampicin resistance. However, additional probes need to be included in the assay to improve the detection of isoniazid-resistant mycobacterium tuberculosis strains in Pakistan.
