OBJECTIVE: Detection of hyphomycetes of the Scedosporium apiospermum complex and Lomentospora prolificans (Sac-Lp) is not yet standardized. Prevalence rates in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and the resistance pattern of these pathogens in Germany are unknown. METHODS: In a one-year prospective study 11 laboratories used a selective medium for isolation of Sac-Lp, examining >11,600 respiratory samples from 2346 patients with CF. Isolates were identified by molecular methods and tested for susceptibility to antifungal drugs. RESULTS: The prevalence of Sac-Lp in patients with CF in Germany varied from 0.0 to 10.5% (mean: 3.1%) among the clinical centres. The benefit of the selective medium SceSel(+) compared to standard media for fungi was documented for >5000 samples. High antifungal resistance was detected in the S. apiospermum complex, and the multiresistance of L. prolificans was confirmed. CONCLUSION: Microbiology laboratories should be aware of these resistant species in patients with CF and consider using a selective medium.
