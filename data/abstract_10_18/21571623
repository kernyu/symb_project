This study examined the susceptibility of a variety of wild-type strains and efflux pump mutants to besifloxacin and the comparator agents sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, moxifloxacin, tetracycline, and ethidium bromide. Organisms tested included Staphylococcus aureus (mepA or norA), Streptococcus pneumoniae (pmrA, patB), Escherichia coli (acrAB::Tn903, tolC::Tn10), Haemophilus influenzae (acrAB) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mepAB-oprM, oprM::OmegaHg(r) rpsL). The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of besifloxacin and comparators were also measured in the presence of the efflux pump inhibitors reserpine, carbonyl cyanide mchlorophenyl- hydrazone, or sodium orthovanadate. Overall, very few meaningful changes (>2-fold) in besifloxacin MIC values resulted from the presence of efflux pump mutations or efflux pump inhibitors. In summary, the novel fluoroquinolone besifloxacin is no exception to the observation that newer fluoroquinolones are generally less affected by efflux pump-mediated resistance than older fluoroquinolones.
