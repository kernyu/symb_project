Persistence activity manifested in the expression of anti-lysozyme, anti-lactoferrin, and antihistone factors promoting inactivation of natural anti-infection resistance factors in the body was revealed in Blastocystis hominis protozoa. Activities of these factors were ranged. The frequency of these factors in clinical isolates of blastocyst decreased in the following order: anti-lactoferrin activity (84.5+/-3.7%)-->anti-lysozyme activity (64.8+/-5.7%)-->anti-histone activity (48.1+/-2.3%). In healthy humans, the corresponding parameters were 7.3+/-1.3, 5.3+/-0.9, and 3.3+/-0.4%, respectively (p<0.05). It was shown that the studied activities in highly virulent blastocysts were higher than in groups of medium-, low-, and avirulent protozoa.
