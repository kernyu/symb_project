REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: There is growing concern worldwide regarding anthelmintic resistance in equine parasites. In order to improve parasite control practices and reduce the selection for resistant parasites, baseline data are required. OBJECTIVES: To describe the current parasite management and control practices used for racehorses. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. METHODS: Thoroughbred and Standardbred trainers were surveyed online regarding demographics, parasite control methods, grazing management and quarantine, and the use of faecal egg counts (FEC), with questions stratified by horse type, i.e. racehorses (horses in training) and spellers (racehorses on a break from training), and industry (Thoroughbred and Standardbred). Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine associations with FEC use. RESULTS: In total, 234 respondents completed the survey for an estimated response rate of 16%. In total, 50.5% of trainers treated horses on an interval treatment strategy and treated a median of 6 (interquartile range (IQR) 4-7) and 6 (IQR 4-8) times annually for Thoroughbred and Standardbred racehorses, respectively. A total of 62.5% (130/208) of respondents reported seeking veterinary advice for deworming products, and FEC had been done by 20.1% (39/194) of respondents. The odds of a trainer doing FEC were 4 times higher if the trainer had consulted a veterinarian, compared with those that had not. CONCLUSIONS: This study has highlighted an industry-wide overuse of anthelmintic products and few trainers were using surveillance-based control strategies. The relationship between veterinarians and trainers should be explored further to enhance information dissemination and implement effective control strategies, to maintain horse health and delay the advance of anthelmintic resistance.
