This study aimed to identify risk factors for dogs becoming rectal carriers of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli while hospitalized in a veterinary teaching hospital. Exposures to potential risk factors, including treatments, hospitalization, and interventions during a 42-day pre-admission period and hospitalization variables, were assessed for 90 cases and 93 controls in a retrospective, risk-based, case-control study. On multivariable analyses, hospitalization for >6 days [odds ratio (OR) 2.91-8.00], treatment with cephalosporins prior to admission (OR 5.04, 95% CI 1.25-20.27), treatment with cephalosporins for >1 day (OR 5.18, 95% CI 1.86-14.41), and treatment with metronidazole (OR 7.17, 95% CI 1.01-50.79) while hospitalized were associated with increased risk of rectal carriage of MDR E. coli during hospitalization. The majority of rectal isolates obtained during the study period conformed to MDR E. coli clonal groups previously obtained from extraintestinal infections. These results can assist the development of improved infection control guidelines for the management of dogs in veterinary hospitals to prevent the occurrence of nosocomial clinical infections.
