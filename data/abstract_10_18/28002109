PURPOSE: To investigate the microbial cause and antibiotic susceptibility of neonatal bacterial conjunctivitis in Korean patients in the 21st century. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients diagnosed with neonatal bacterial conjunctivitis between January 2000 and December 2015. We recorded the organism, antibiotic susceptibility, and antibiotics used. RESULTS: A total of 82 neonates were included in the study (53 males and 29 females), with a mean age of 17.5 +/- 7.1 days. The most commonly isolated organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (43 cases, 52.4%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (11 cases, 13.4%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (11 cases, 13.4%), Serratia marcescens (4 cases, 4.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4 cases, 4.9%), and Enterobacter cloacae (3 cases, 3.7%). We found no cases of Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis infection. Resistance to methicillin (83.7%), macrolide (81.4%), and aminoglycoside (23.3%) was observed in patients with S. aureus infection. Conjunctivitis that did not improve with erythromycin or tobramycin generally improved with the additional use of tosufloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of neonatal gonococcal or chlamydial conjunctivitis has decreased in the 21st century. However, methicillin-resistant S. aureus has been increasing, but these cases are responsive to tosufloxacin.
