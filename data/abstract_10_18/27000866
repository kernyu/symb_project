Background.: Emergence of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) bacteria has forced clinicians to use off-label antimicrobial agents such as tigecycline. We present our experience on salvage use of tigecycline for the treatment of infections caused by XDR Gram-negative bacteria in critically ill children and review published cases. Methods.: We conducted a retrospective chart review in pediatric departments of a tertiary level hospital from January 2009 to May 2014. Patients were identified using pharmacy database. For the literature review, relevant articles were identified from PubMed. Results.: In our case series, 13 children (7 males) with a median age of 8 years (range, 2.5 months-14 years) received tigecycline for >/=2 days as treatment for healthcare-associated infections including 5 bacteremias, 6 lower respiratory tract infections, and 3 other infections. Isolated pathogens were XDR Gram-negative bacteria except 1. A loading dose (range, 1.8-6.5 mg/kg) was given in all except 2 cases. Maintenance dose was given at 1-3.2 mg/kg q12 h. Other antimicrobials including colistin and aminoglycosides (85% and 62%, respectively) were coadministered to all patients. No serious adverse events were detected in these very ill children. Twenty cases of children treated with tigecycline were previously published, mostly for multidrug-resistant/XDR bacteria. An episode of acute pancreatitis and neutrophil engraftment delay in 2 cases were reported during tigecycline treatment. Analyzing reported and all our cases together, mortality in bloodstream infections was 86%, whereas in nonbacteremic cases it was 24% (P = .009). Conclusions.: Tigecycline, given at the range of administered doses as salvage therapy and in combination with other antimicrobial agents, seemed to be well tolerated in a series of mainly critically ill pediatric patients and demonstrated relatively good clinical response in nonbacteremic patients.
