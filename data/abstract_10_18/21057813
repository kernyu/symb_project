The negative effects of coccidiosis on poultry health and productivity and increasing problems related to drug resistance have stimulated the search for novel and alternative methods of control. The present study evaluates the anticoccidial activity of curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a natural polyphenolic compound abundant in the rhizome of the perennial herb turmeric (Curcuma longa) which is a spice and food colorant commonly used in curries and also used as medicinal herb. Its effects were evaluated on Eimeria tenella sporozoites, including morphological alterations, sporozoite viability and infectivity to Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells. Morphological alterations of the sporozoites were recorded as deformation due to swelling and cell membrane corrugations. Curcumin at concentrations of 25, 50, 100, 200 and 400 muM showed considerable effects on sporozoite morphology and viability in a dose-dependent manner after incubation over 3, 6, 18 and 24 h while lower curcumin concentrations (6.25 and 12.5 muM) were not effective. In comparison to the untreated control, sporozoite infectivity was reduced at curcumin concentrations of 100 and 200 muM by 41.6% and 72.8%, respectively. Negative effects of curcumin on MDBK cells were not seen at these concentrations; however, curcumin at concentrations of 1,800, 600 and 400 muM was toxic to MDBK cells and affected cell proliferation. In conclusion, curcumin exhibited a marked inhibitory effect in vitro on E. tenella sporozoites inducing morphological changes and reducing sporozoite viability and infectivity.
