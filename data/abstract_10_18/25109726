BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Antibiotic resistance in pathogens has become a serious problem worldwide. Therefore, the search for new antibiotics for drug resistanct pathogens is an important endeavor. The present study deals with the production of anti-methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) potential of Streptomyces rubrolavendulae ICN3 and evaluation of anti-MRSA compound in zebrafish embryos. METHODS: The antibiotic production from S. rubrolavendulae ICN3 was optimized in solid state fermentation and extracted. The antagonistic activity was confirmed against MRSA and purified in silica gel column and reverse phase--HPLC with an absorption maximum at 215 nm. Minimal inhibitory concentration of the compound was determined by broth microdilution method. Zebrafish embryos were used to evaluate the extract/compound for its minimal inhibition studies, influences on heart beat rates, haematopoietic blood cell count and lethal dose values. RESULTS: Streptomyces rubrolavendulae ICN3 showed potent antagonistic activity against MRSA with a zone of 42 mm. The minimum inhibitory concentration was calculated as 500 mug/ml of the crude extract and the purified C23 exhibited 2.5 mug/ml in in vitro assay. The LC 50 value of the anti MRSA compound C23 was calculated as 60.49 mug/ml and the MRSA treated embryos survived in the presence of purified compound C23 at a dose of 10 mug/ml. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that the compound was potent with less toxic effects in zebrafish embryonic model system for MRSA infection. Further structural evaluation and analysis in higher mammalian model system may lead to a novel drug candidate for drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
