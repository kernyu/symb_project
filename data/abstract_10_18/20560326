By using two-dimensional eletrophoresis method, this paper studied the protein expression level in Baphicacanthus cusia (Nees) Bremek leaves after sprayed with exogenous salicylic acid (SA). A total of significantly different 20 protein spots were obtained, among which, eight protein spots were indentified, being of ATP synthase, alpha tubulin, cell division protein, glyceraldehydephosphate dehydrogenase, and ACC oxidase, respectively. The expression abundance of all identified proteins was up-regulated, except for ACC oxidase which was down-regulated. Therefore, exogenous SA could affect the protein expression level in B. cusia leaves, and improve the plant resistance to environment stress and self-restoration capability.
