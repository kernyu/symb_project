Arabidopsis VQ motif-containing proteins have recently been demonstrated to interact with several WRKY transcription factors; however, their specific biological functions and the molecular mechanisms underlying their involvement in defense responses remain largely unclear. Here, we showed that two VQ genes, VQ12 and VQ29, were highly responsive to the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. To characterize their roles in plant defense, we generated amiR-vq12 transgenic plants by using an artificial miRNA approach to suppress the expression of VQ12, and isolated a loss-of-function mutant of VQ29. Phenotypic analysis showed that decreasing the expression of VQ12 and VQ29 simultaneously rendered the amiR-vq12 vq29 double mutant plants resistant against B. cinerea. Consistently, the B. cinerea-induced expression of defense-related PLANT DEFENSIN1.2 (PDF1.2) was increased in amiR-vq12 vq29. In contrast, constitutively-expressing VQ12 or VQ29 confered transgenic plants susceptible to B. cinerea. Further investigation revealed that VQ12 and VQ29 physically interacted with themselves and each other to form homodimers and heterodimer. Moreover, expression analysis of VQ12 and VQ29 in defense-signaling mutants suggested that they were partially involved in jasmonate (JA)-signaling pathway. Taken together, our study indicates that VQ12 and VQ29 negatively regulate plant basal resistance against B. cinerea.
