Candida albicans metabolic activity in the presence and absence of acetylcholine was measured using phenotypic microarray analysis. Acetylcholine inhibited C. albicans biofilm formation by slowing metabolism independent of biofilm forming capabilities. Phenotypic microarray analysis can therefore be used for screening compound libraries for novel anti-fungal drugs and measuring antifungal resistance.
