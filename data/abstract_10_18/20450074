OBJECTIVE: To investigate antibiotic resistance and the prevalence of serotype of Streptococcus pneumoniae. METHODS: Totally 123 strains of S. pneumoniae were collected to test the susceptibility of 6 antibiotics by K-B method according to the standard of CLIS. Serotyping of S. pneumoniae was performed by using quelling reaction. RESULTS: Among 123 strains of S. pneumoniae, all strains (100%) were resistant to AZM. There were 65.04%, 78.05%, 19.51%, 0.81%, 0% of S. pneumoniae were resistant against the MH, SXT, C, RA, OFX respectively. 11 serotypes were involved in 123 strains. The prevalent serogroup were 6, 14, 15, 19 and 23.5 strains were unable to serotype. The multi-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae included in serogroup 6 and 19. CONCLUSION: The antibiotic resistance of S. pneumoniae is very serious. Most of them are multi-resistant strains. The prevalent serogroup, especially of the multi-resistant strains, are 6 and 19 serogroup.
