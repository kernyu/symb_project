Burkholderia spp. strains collected in Spain over a 13-year period from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) (n = 148), non-CF patients (n = 103) and from environmental sources (n = 64) were characterised. One hundred and forty-one of the examined strains were involved in seven suspected nosocomial disease outbreaks. Strains were identified by their 16s rRNA and recA genes. Their genetic relatedness, the possession of cable pili and the B. cepacia epidemic strain marker (BCESM), and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents were studied using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), cblA and esmR genes analysis, and by the E-test, respectively. The genomovar distribution for the 315 strains was as follows: B. stabilis 29.5 %, B. cepacia 14.9 %, B. multivorans 11.1 %, B. cenocepacia IIIA 9.5 %, B. vietnamiensis 3.8 %, B. cenocepacia IIIB 3.5 %, and B. ambifaria and B. pyrrocinia 0.3 % each. The genetic diversity of the B. cepacia complex (Bcc) was ample, with 57 different SpeI types, showing a genetic similarity of 36.4-96.6 %. No strain carried cblA, whereas 25 B. cenocepacia genotypes harboured BCESM (23 from patients with CF). Antimicrobial resistance rates to tobramycin (TOB; 86 %) and imipenem (IPM; 67 %) were high. The strains from patients with CF showed significantly greater resistance to piperacillin (PIP), levofloxacin (LVX) and co-trimoxazole (SXT) than those isolated from non-CF patients (p < 0.05). In conclusion, B. cenocepacia was the most prevalent genomovar found in patients with CF (19.1 %), whereas B. cepacia was the most common among non-CF patients (20.7 %). B. stabilis (47.6 %) was the most common environmental genomovar. Susceptibility to antimicrobial agents depended on genomovar status and strain origin.
