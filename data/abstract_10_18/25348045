Although HIV-1 drug resistance is a major obstacle in Indonesia, information on drug resistance is limited. In this study, the viral subtype and appearance of drug resistance mutations in the HIV-1 protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) genes were determined among drug-treated, HIV-1-infected patients in Surabaya. HIV-1 patients who received antiretroviral therapy (ART) more than 2 years were randomly recruited regardless of the viral load or ART failure. Fifty-eight HIV-1 PR genes and 53 RT genes were sequenced. CRF01_AE viruses were identified as the predominant strain. Major drug resistance mutations were not detected in the PR genes. In contrast, 37.7% (20/53) of the participants had one or more major drug resistance mutations in the RT genes, predominantly M184V (28.3%), K103N (11.3%), and thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs) (20.8%). The high prevalence of drug resistance mutations in RT genes indicated the necessity of monitoring the effectiveness of ART in Indonesia.
