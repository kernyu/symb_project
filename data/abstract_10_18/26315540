OBJECTIVE: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by the uncontrolled production of inflammatory cytokines, among which type I interferon (IFN) is recognized as a crucial pathogenic factor. The expression of microRNA-146a (miR-146a) is reduced in the white blood cells of SLE patients and accounts for their overactivated inflammatory responses. However, the mechanism of the reduction of miR-146a is still not fully understood. This study was undertaken to test whether the key pathogenic cytokine, type I IFN, is responsible for the dysregulation of miR-146a in SLE. METHODS: Gene and protein expression was measured in all cells by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Northern blotting, or Western blotting. In THP-1 cells, expression of monocyte chemotactic protein-induced protein 1 (MCPIP-1) was knocked down with a lentivirus encoding a short hairpin RNA targeting MCPIP1. The cells were pretreated with type I IFN and assessed for gene expression levels of miR-146a. White blood cells from patients with SLE were analyzed for the expression of the IFN-inducible genes MCPIP1 and miR-146a, and the gene expression data were compared for correlation. RESULTS: Pretreatment of THP-1 cells with type I IFN attenuated the induction of miR-146a posttranscriptionally, by down-regulating the expression of pre-miR-146a but not pri-miR-146a or its original unspliced transcript. Expression of MCPIP-1, which was enhanced by type I IFN, was found to be responsible for the inhibition of miR-146a. In white blood cells from patients with SLE, MCPIP1 expression was elevated, and its expression correlated positively with the IFN score and negatively with the miR-146a transcript level. CONCLUSION: Type I IFN inhibits the maturation of miR-146a through the up-regulation of MCPIP-1, and thus contributes to the uncontrolled inflammation and excessive inflammatory gene expression in SLE.
