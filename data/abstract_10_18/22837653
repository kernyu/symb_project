Enoyl acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase (FabI) is a potential target for the development of antibacterial agents. Three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationships (3D-QSAR) for substituted formamides series of FabI inhibitors were investigated using comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) techniques. Pharmacophore and molecular docking methods were used for construction of the molecular alignments. A training set of 36 compounds was performed to create the 3D-QSAR models and their external predictivity was proven using a test set of 11 compounds. Graphical interpretation of the results revealed important structural features of the formamides related to the active site of FabI. The results may be exploited for further optimization of the design of new potent FabI inhibitors.
