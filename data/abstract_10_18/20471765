As part of Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection/USA Surveillance Programme, we monitored the occurrence of quinolone resistance in Escherichia coli over a 10-year period. A total of 271 E. coli isolates from our institution were tested over a 10-year period. Screening for quinolone resistance (qnr) gene was performed. A decline in susceptibility of E. coli isolates to quinolones and aminoglycosides was noted over the 10-year span (P < 0.0001), which was significantly reduced compared with the average susceptibility of all sites. Introduction of quinolone prophylaxis has led to a significant decline in susceptibility of E. coli to all quinolones. The organisms remain susceptible to carbapenems, cefepime, and piperacillin/tazobactam. Periodic surveillance allows for detection of resistance patterns and adjustment of empiric antibiotic choice in patients at high risk for infection.
