Occurrence of antibiotics in the soils substantially fertilized with antibiotics-enriched animal manures is very of concern. This paper investigated the concentration and distribution of four tetracycline antibiotics in soils from vegetable field chronically fertilized with manures in subtropical area using solid-phase extraction followed by high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The sum concentrations of four tetracycline compounds ranged from 1.35 microg/kg to 22.52 microg/kg with an average of 7.35 microg/kg. There were thirty one to one hundred percent of the soil samples were detected with average concentrations of 0.63- 3.11 microg/kg for four tetracycline compounds which dominated mostly with oxytetracycline and secondly with deoxytetracycline. Composition and levels of tetracycline compounds varied obviously in both horizontal and vertical soils. The concentration of tetracycline compounds in soil profile decreased rapidly with the depth and some of the compounds were still detected in 60 to 80 centimeter depth of soil. It is concluded that tetracycline antibiotics in soils from vegetable field chronically fertilized with manures in subtropical area were generally lower and less ecotoxic risk for soil ecosystem. But it should not be ignored in view of combined toxic effect and resistance of various compounds.
