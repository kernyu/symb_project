Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli serotype O157:H7 is a major cause of foodborne outbreaks and hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Here, we report the draft genome sequences of three antibiotic-resistant E. coli O157:H7 strains isolated from feedlot cattle. These draft genome sequences will aid in the development of sequence-based tools for the detection of virulence and antimicrobial resistance genotypes.
