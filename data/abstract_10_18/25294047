UNLABELLED: The in vitro activity of the imidazolium salt C16 MImCl against planktonic and biofilm cells of multidrug-resistant isolates of Candida tropicalis was evaluated, both in solution and applied on a commercial catheter surface. This was determined by inhibition and susceptibility assays of biofilm and planktonic cells. In both cases, C16 MImCl prevented in vitro biofilm formation of C. tropicalis strains, including multidrug-resistant ones. Outstanding performances were observed, even at extremely low concentrations. Furthermore, this is the first report of the antifungal lock property of C16 MImCl, using a tracheal catheter as the test specimen to mimic a clinical in vivo condition. As such, C16 MImCl has been identified as a promising antimicotic pharmaceutical candidate for the treatment of candidiasis infections. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The imidazolium salt 1-n-hexadecyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (C16 MImCl) strongly prevents, in concentrations as low as 0.028 mug ml(-1) , the biofilm formation of multidrug-resistant Candida tropicalis isolates, either in solution or applied on the surface of commercial catheters. This presents an effective antimicotic candidate and alternative for invasive clinical procedure toolset asepsis.
