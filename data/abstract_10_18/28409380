The recent, rapid increase in bacterial antimicrobial resistance has become a major public health concern. One approach to generate new classes of antibacterials is targeting virulence rather than the viability of bacteria. Proteins of the Dsb system, which play a key role in the virulence of many pathogenic microorganisms, represent potential new drug targets. The first part of the article presents current knowledge of how the Dsb system impacts function of various protein secretion systems that influence the virulence of many pathogenic bacteria. Next, the review describes methods used to study the structure, biochemistry, and microbiology of the Dsb proteins and shows how these experiments broaden our knowledge about their function. The lessons gained from basic research have led to a specific search for inhibitors blocking the Dsb networks.
