Prompt diagnosis of an oseltamivir-resistant marker is important for patient management, in particular to prevent the spread of resistant strains in the recent human H7N9 outbreak. We tailored a pyrosequencing assay to reveal neuraminidase R292K, a resistant marker found in one isolate from China, and demonstrated its performance in both sensitivity and specificity. In addition, a semi-nested polymerase chain reaction was applied, which enhanced the detection rate by at least 10-fold. We validated this assay by examining the marker in Taiwan's first imported human case and found R and K in quasispecies.
