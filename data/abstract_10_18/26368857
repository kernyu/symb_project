BACKGROUND: Lemierre disease is a rare postanginal sepsis caused by the anaerobe Fusobacterium necrophorum. It is associated with a pharyngitis that progresses quickly to thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein and metastatic abscesses to pulmonary, soft tissue, articular, and organ systems. It is rarely associated with spinal epidural abscesses. Because of the increasing antibiotic resistance, its incidence is on the rise. METHODS: A single-patient case report of an adolescent male who initially presented to our institution for bacteremia and febrile episodes. Over a 1-week course, he developed severe back pain and progressive lower extremity weakness. Advanced imaging revealed an epidural abscess spanning T2-L3 level with extension into the psoas and the paraspinal musculature. Acute management consisted of broad-spectrum intravenous (IV) antibiotics and hemilaminectomy decompression from T2 to L3. The patient completed a 6-week course of IV antibiotics and was followed for a 1-year time period with close clinical follow-up. RESULTS: Blood cultures identified the infecting organism as F. necrophorum. The combination of IV antibiotics and acute hemilaminectomy decompression resulted in successful clearance of the infecting organism with normalization of inflammatory markers and cultures. The patient noted immediate and sustained neurological improvement, with return of full motor and sensory function. At the 1-year timepoint, the patient was able to return to sports and no sagittal/coronal imbalance was noted on radiographs. CONCLUSIONS: An aggressive case of Lemierre disease with extensive epidural abscess formation and neurological weakness was successfully managed with the combination of IV antibiotics and extensive hemilaminectomies for decompression. The patient exhibited no long-term sequela as a result of either the epidural abscess or of its treatment. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level V.
