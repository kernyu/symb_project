Production of beta-lactamases is the primary mechanism of antibiotic resistance employed by gram-negative pathogens. Chromogenic beta-lactams are important reagents for detection and assay of beta-lactamases, but limited commercial availability and exorbitant pricing of these compounds are prohibitive. Here we describe a straightforward synthesis of a chromogenic cephalosporin for beta-lactamase assay that gives an overall yield of 74%. On hydrolysis, its lambda(max) undergoes a bathochromic shift that is easy to see and measure spectrophotometrically with a Deltaepsilon(442 nm) of 14,500 cm(-)(1) M(-)(1). This compound was shown to be a substrate for a variety of beta-lactamases.
