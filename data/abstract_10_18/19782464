Most of the gemcitabine (dFdC) resistant cell lines manifested high NFkappaB activity. The NFkappaB activity can be induced by dFdC and 5-FU exposure. The chemosensitizing effect of disulfiram (DS), an anti-alcoholism drug and NFkappaB inhibitor, and copper (Cu) on the chemoresistant cell lines was examined. The DS/Cu complex significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of dFdC (resistant cells: 12.2-1085-fold) and completely reversed the dFdC resistance in the resitant cell lines. The dFdC-induced NFkappaB activity was markedly inhibited by DS/Cu complex. The data from this study indicated that DS may be used in clinic to improve the therapeutic effect of dFdC in breast and colon cancer patients.
