Nanoparticulate delivery of biocides has the potential to decrease levels of exposure to non-target organisms, and miminize long-term exposure that can promote the development of resistance. Silica nanoparticles are an ideal vehicle since they are inert, biocompatible, biodegradable, and thermally and chemically stable. Encapsulation of biocides within nanoparticulates can improve their stability and longevity and maximize the biocidal potential of hydrophobic volatile compounds. Herein, we have shown that the plant secondary metabolites allyl isothiocyanate and cinnamaldehyde demonstrated increased antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli in planktonic form, when packaged into mesoporous silica nanoparticles. Furthermore, the biocide-loaded nanoparticles showed activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms that have inherent resistance to antimicrobial agents. The delivery platform can also be expanded to traditional biocides and other non-conventional antimicrobial agents.
