Quorum-sensing signalling molecules such as Nacyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) enable certain Gramnegative bacteria to respond to environmental changes through behaviours, such as biofilm formation and flagellar movement. The present study aimed to identify Acinetobacter baumannii AHLs and assess their influence on antibiotic resistance. A clinical isolate of A. baumannii strain S (AbS) was collected from the wound of a burn patient and highperformance liquid chromatography and tandem quadrupole or quadrupole timeofflight highresolution mass spectrometry was used to identify AbS AHLs. Antibiotic sensitivity was assessed in an AHLdeficient AbS mutant (AbSM), and the expression of drug-resistance genes in the presence of meropenem in AbS, AbSM and AbSM treated with the AHL N-3-hydroxy-dodecanoyl-homoserine lactone (N3OHC12HSL). AbSM was more sensitive to meropenem and piperacillin than wildtype AbS, but resistance was restored by supplementation with N3OHC12HSL. In addition, meropenemtreated AbSM expressed lower levels of the drugresistance genes oxacillinase 51, AmpC, AdeA and AdeB; treatment with N3OHC12HSL also restored the expression of these genes. Overall, the results of the present study indicate that N3OHC12HSL may be involved in regulating the expression of drugresistance genes in A. baumannii. Therefore, this quorumsensing signalling molecule may be an important target for treating multidrugresistant A. baumannii infections.
