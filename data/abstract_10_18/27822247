A total of 70 samples were collected from chicken meat obtained from 10 markets in Tehran, Iran from which 39 Campylobacter coli were isolated. Among 10 antibiotics used, maximum resistance was seen to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (SXT) (97.36%), nalidixic acid (94.8%), ciprofloxacin (87.7%), streptomycin (89.72%), and tetracycline (97.4%). No resistance was to gentamycin was observed. None of the Campylobacter strains under study harbored integron, suggesting the involvement of other resistance mechanisms in emergence of multi drug resistance (MDR) phenotype among the isolates. Two major types (A and B) and 15 subtypes (A1-A8 and B1-B7) were identified. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis demonstrated a high degree of homogeneity while the majority of the isolates shared identical or very similar PFGE genotypes. Isolates with identical genotypes differed in their resistance profile, although all of them assigned to MDR phenotype. To our knowledge, this is the first molecular survey from Iran characterizing Campylobacter isolates from poultry, which adds to our knowledge the epidemiological linkage of Campylobacter isolates with MDR properties from different sources and emphasizes the need for cautious use of antimicrobials in different fields of food production chain.
