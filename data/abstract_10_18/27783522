There still remains a need to develop new anti-HCV agents with distinct mechanism of action (MOA) due to the occurrence of resistance to direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs). Cajanine, a stilbenic component isolated from Cajanus cajan L., was identified as a potent HCV inhibitor by phenotypic screening in this work (EC50 = 3.17 +/- 0.75 muM). The intensive structure optimization provided significant insights into the structure-activity relationships. Furthermore, the MOA study revealed that cajanine inhibited HCV replications via down-regulating a cellular protein chondroitin sulfate N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1. In consistency with this host-targeting mechanism, cajanine showed the similar magnitude of inhibitory activity against both drug-resistant and wild-type HCV and synergistically inhibited HCV replication with approved DAAs. Taken together, our study not only presented cajanine derivatives as a novel class of anti-HCV agents but also discovered a promising anti-HCV target to combat drug resistance.
