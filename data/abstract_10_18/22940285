A number of defense polypeptides from latent seeds of weed cereal barnyard grass (Echinochloa crusgalli L.) has been isolated and characterized using an acidic extraction and high performance liquid chromatography methods in combination with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and Edman sequencing. Members of three antimicrobial peptide families and two protease inhibitor families were found to be localized in barnyard grass seeds. Their biological activity concerning to Gram-Positive and Gram-Negative phytopathogenic bacteria, as well as oomycete Phytophthora infestans, has been investigated. Diversity of barnyard grass defense peptides is a significant factor that provides a resistance of E. crusgalli seeds to germination and latent phases.
