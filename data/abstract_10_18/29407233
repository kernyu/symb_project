The antibiotics were frequently used for combating bacterial infections in aquaculture, but this treatment causes antibiotic resistance, negative impact on the environment and on health, and accumulation of residual in edible tissues. Several evidences have considered the dietary supplementation with natural products an interesting alternative to antibiotics, as the use of curcumin, a polyphenol with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether fish fed with a diet containing 150mg curcumin/kg feed is able to enhance the resistance of silver catfish to Streptococcus agalactiae infection. Our results demonstrated that curcumin dietary supplement exerts potent bactericidal action against S. agalactiae, presenting 100% of therapeutic efficacy when compared to infected and non-supplemented animals. Also, the treatment prevented the occurrence of clinical signs of disease, as erratic swimming, corneal opacity, skin lesions in the fin and tail, and loss of appetite. In summary, curcumin can be a promising dietary supplement for improving disease resistance.
