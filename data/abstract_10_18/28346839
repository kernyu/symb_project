Increased enterococcal infections in hospitals and multidrug-resistant and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) isolated from humans, animals, and food sources raised public health concern on the presence of VRE in multiple sources. We performed a comparative analysis of the antimicrobial resistance and genetics of VRE isolates derived from fresh produce and human fecal samples. Of 389 Enterococcus isolates, 8 fecal and 3 produce isolates were resistant to vancomycin and teicoplanin; all harbored vanA gene. The VRE isolates showed multidrug-resistant properties. The isolates from fresh produce in this study showed to have the common shared characteristics with the isolates from humans by the results of antimicrobial resistance, multilocus sequence typing, and Tn 1546 transposon analysis. Therefore, VRE isolates from fresh produce are likely related to VRE derived from humans. The results suggested that VRE may contaminate vegetables through the environment, and the contaminated vegetables could then act as a vehicle for human infections. Ongoing nationwide surveillance of antibiotic resistance and the promotion of the proper use of antibiotics are necessary.
