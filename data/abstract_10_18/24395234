Deletants of the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway genes FEN1 and SUR4 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as well as deletants of their orthologs in Candida albicans, were found to be 2- to 5-fold-more sensitive to amphotericin B (AmB) than parent strains. The inhibition of sphingolipid biosynthesis in parent strains by myriocin sensitized them to AmB, which can be reversed by providing phytosphingosine, an intermediate in the sphingolipid pathway. These results indicate that sphingolipids modulate AmB resistance, with implications for mechanisms underlying AmB action and resistance.
