Klebsiella especially Klebsiella pneumoniae is gaining renewed interest because of emergence of multidrug resistance among klebsiellae associated with infections.These are now being recognised as one of the major threats to effective management of patients in hospital, especially in developing country like India. Pathogenic mechanism of klebsiella Infections are associated with virulence factors such as capsule and mucoid phenotype, etc. The present study was designed to determine the virulence factors and antibiogram of klebsiellae, isolated from various clinical specimen in a tertiary care hospital of West Bengal, India. A total of 2370 clinical specimens which include blood, urine, wound swab, sputum were processed for isolation and identification of klebsiella to the species level. For each klebsiella isolate demonstration of capsule was done by capsule relief stain and detection of mucoid phenotype was done by string test. Antibiogram was studied by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method according to Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) guidelines. The results showed that klebsiella species were isolated and identified from 139 clinical samples (5.9% prevalence rate) among which 4 (2.9%) were Klebsiella oxytoca and the remaining 135 Isolates (97.1%) were Klebsiella pneumoniae. Out of 139 klebsiella isolates, capsule was demonstrated in 118 (84.9%) and 116 (83.4%) were positive for string test. Antibiogram revealed that most of isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were multidrug resistant.
