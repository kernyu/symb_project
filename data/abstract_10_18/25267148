AIM: Aim of the study was to find effective instrumental methodologies and procedures for scaling and deplaquing without compromising the structure of metal-free, monolithic lithium disilicate and layered zirconia prosthetics. METHODS: Of 14 decontaminated, extracted teeth in good anatomical condition, 7 veneers lithium disilicate monolithic and 7 layered zirconia crowns were prepared for testing and divided into 6 treatment groups. Each group was composed of a veneer and a crown. The division of the groups was carried out according to the type of treatment performed- instrumental carbon fiber and steel tips, prophylaxis paste with high and low RDA (Relative dentin abrasion), bicarbonate powder. Samples were examined and observed through a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Afterwards a detailed comparison of the images of treated and untreated samples was performed. The images were at the same magnification, thus showing the differences in the treated samples. RESULTS: The monolithic lithium disilicate presents minor damage to the surface but no excessive changes to the structure in general post treatment. The layered zirconia resulted in notable damage with evident abrasions on the layered ceramic structure after the use of ultrasound with a steel tip and air flow with bicarbonate. Carbon fibre tips and prophylaxis paste containing perlite and low RDA did not create notable changes to the properties of the materials in question. CONCLUSION: The results of the disilicate monolithic appear to show it to be a much more resistant material compared to layered zirconia in ceramic. Its resistance is demonstrated by the lack of notable damage in all the treatment groups.
