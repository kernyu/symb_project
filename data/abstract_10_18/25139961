Our aim was to assess national prescribing trends and determine longitudinal resistance patterns for topical antimicrobials in New Zealand. We observed a dramatic increase in fusidic acid (FA) resistance, and clonal expansion of FA-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. This increase was concurrent with a significant national increase in topical FA dispensing.
