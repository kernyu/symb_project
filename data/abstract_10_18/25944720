Some Australian strain types of Clostridium difficile appear unique, highlighting the global diversity of this bacterium. We examined recent and historic local isolates, finding predominantly toxinotype 0 strains, but also toxinotypes V and VIII. All isolates tested were susceptible to vancomycin and metronidazole, while moxifloxacin resistance was only detected in recent strains.
