The resistance of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAB) isolates to most traditional antibiotics results in huge challenges for infection therapy. We investigated the in vitro activities of both l- and d-lycosin-I against MDRAB. These two compounds displayed high antibacterial activities and rapid bactericidal effects against MDRAB. Moreover, the compounds retained their activity even at high salt (Mg(2+) or Ca(2+)) concentrations. These results demonstrate the potential of lycosin-I to be developed as a new antibiotic.
