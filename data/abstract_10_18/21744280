Since 2004, an increasing number of multidrug-resistant Salmonella serovar Concord infections have been isolated in Belgium among children adopted from Ethiopia. The patients or their family were interviewed and the isolates were subtyped. Between 2004 and 2009, a total of 39 Salmonella Concord infections were isolated from patients. Thirty-four isolates presented a multidrug resistance including resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins. Thirty-six cases involved children and 30 of these were adopted from Ethiopia. One case was due to contact with an adopted child and for the other 5 cases no direct epidemiological link with Ethiopia could be found, although four isolates displayed the same patterns observed on the adoptees' isolates, strongly suggesting a phylogenetic relationship with the Ethiopian isolates. Our study confirmed the emergence in Europe of S. Concord isolates resistant to third-generation cephalosporin among Ethiopian adoptees. We have demonstrated that transmission (intra- and extra familial) can happen even if the frequency seems to be low. The presence and the transmission of such a multidrug-resistant Salmonella infection constitute a major concern, since such strains could jeopardize classical antibiotic therapy in patients at risk. This study provides useful information for parents adopting children and for their family practitioner.
