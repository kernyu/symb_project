OBJECTIVES: Temocillin is a 6alpha-methoxy derivative of ticarcillin that is resilient to ESBLs. Prospective data about its in vivo activity remain scarce. Our aims were: (i) to evaluate the activity of temocillin in a urinary tract infection (UTI) model due to ESBL-producing Escherichia coli and compare it with that of imipenem; and (ii) to define in vivo susceptibility breakpoints. METHODS: Mice were infected with a susceptible E. coli CFT073-RR or its transconjugant (CFT073-RR Tc) harbouring a blaCTX-M-15-carrying plasmid, using an ascending UTI model. Therapeutic regimens were chosen in order to reproduce percentage of time of free drug concentrations above MIC (fT>MIC) obtained in humans with standard regimens of temocillin (200 mg/kg every 2 h for 2 g every 12 h) or imipenem (100 mg/kg every 2 h for 1 g every 8 h). Additional regimens of temocillin (200 mg/kg every 4 and 6 h) with reduced fT>MIC were studied. RESULTS: MICs of temocillin and imipenem were 4/8 and 0.5/0.5 mg/L, for CFT073-RR and CFT073-RR Tc, respectively. In vivo, when given every 2 h (fT>MIC = 82% and 70%), temocillin was bactericidal and as effective as imipenem in kidneys against both strains without selecting resistant mutants. Temocillin remained active even when given every 4 h, generating an fT>MIC of 41% and 35%, which corresponded to a breakpoint of 16 mg/L in humans with the standard regimen. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations support the consideration of a standard regimen of temocillin as an alternative to carbapenems for the treatment of UTI due to CTX-M-producing E. coli strains with an MIC of 16 mg/L or less.
