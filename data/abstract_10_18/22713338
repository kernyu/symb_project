An in vitro dilutional pharmacokinetic model of infection was used to study the pharmacodynamics of doripenem in terms of the ability to kill Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter baumannii and also changes in their population profiles. In dose-ranging studies, the cumulative percentages of a 24-h period that the drug concentration exceeds the MIC under steady-state pharmacokinetic conditions (T(MIC)s) required for doripenem to produce a 24-h bacteriostatic effect and a -2-log-unit reduction in viable count were 25% +/- 11% and 35% +/- 13%, respectively, for P. aeruginosa (MIC range, 0.24 to 3 mg/liter) and 20% +/- 11% and 33% +/- 12%, respectively, for Acinetobacter spp. (MIC range, 0.45 to 3.0 mg/liter). A T(MIC) of >40 to 50% produced a maximum response with both species at 24 h or 48 h of exposure. After 24 h of exposure to doripenem at a T(MIC) in the range of 12.5 to 37.5%, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii population profiles revealed mutants able to grow on 4x MIC-containing medium; such changes were further amplified by 48 h of exposure. Dose-fractionation experiments targeting T(MIC)s of 12.5%, 25%, or 37.5% as six exposures, two exposures, or a single exposure over 48 h with a single strain of P. aeruginosa indicated that changes in population profiles were greatest with multiple exposures at T(MIC) targets of 12.5 or 25%. In contrast, multiple exposures at 37.5% T(MIC) most effectively suppressed total bacterial counts and changes in population profiles. Simulations of human doses of doripenem of 500 mg, 1,000 mg, 2,000 mg, and 3,000 mg every 8 h over 96 h showed marked initial killing up to 6 h but growback thereafter. Changes in population profiles occurred only in the regimen of 500 mg every 8 h against P. aeruginosa but occurred with all dose regimens for A. baumannii strains. A doripenem T(MIC) of >/=40 to 50% is maximally effective in killing P. aeruginosa or A. baumannii and suppressing changes in population profiles in short-term experiments for up to 48 h; however, a T(MIC) of 12.5 to 25% amplifies population changes, especially with exposures every 8 h. In longer-term experiments, up to 96 h, even doripenem doses of 4 to 6 times those used in human studies proved incapable of pathogen eradication and prevention of changes in population profiles. The association of a T(MIC) of 25 to 37.5% with changes in population profiles has implications in terms of future clinical breakpoint setting.
