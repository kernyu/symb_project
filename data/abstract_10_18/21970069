Escherichia coli, being an important part of normal intestinal flora, is a frequent carrier of antimicrobial drug resistance markers and food is the most important vector of antimicrobial resistance genes between humans and animals. The aim of this study was to confirm the presence and frequency of resistance markers in Escherichia coli from intestinal flora and from food as an indicator of antimicrobial resistance level in the population. The experiment included 100 fecal Escherichia coli isolates from healthy donors, 50 isolated in 2007 and 50 in 2010, and 50 from food samples. The resistance markers were found in all groups of isolates. The resistance to ampicillin and cotrimoxazole was most commonly found. The finding of multi-drug-resistant strains and resistance to ciprofloxacin is important. The frequency of resistance markers was similar in food and feces. The results of this study show the need to introduce systematic monitoring of antimicrobial resistance of these bacteria.
