The minimum inhibitory concentation (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of 8 parental antibiotics were determined using 21 strains of Haemophilus influenzae from 21 children with invasive H. influenzae infection in 2006-2009. Children were from 4 months to 12 years, with 18 (85.7%) under 1 year old. Diagnosies involved meningitis or pneumonia in 7 (33.3%); epiglottitis, phlegmon, or arthritis in 2 each (9.5%), and occult bacteremia in 1 (4.8%). The capsule type was b (Hib) in 19 (90.5%). Classified by penicillin binding protein (PBP) gene mutation, strains were classified into (i) 6 beta-lactamase negative ampicillin resistant (BLNAR) (28.6%), (ii) 5 low-BLNAR (23.8%), (iii) 4 beta-lactamase positive clavulanic acid/amoxicillin resistant-II (19.0%), (iv) 2 beta-lactamase positive ampicillin resistant (9.5%), and (v) 4 beta-lactamase negative ampicillin susceptible (19.0%). Compared to a 2003-2005 survey, the number of sensitive strains had decreased significantly (p < 0.05). MIC90/MBC90 of ampicillin was 64/>128 microg/mL, piperacillin 16/>128 microg/mL, cefotaxime 0.5/0.5 microg/mL, ceftriaxone 0.12/0.12 microg/mL, panipenem 0.5/0.5 microg/mL, meropenem 0.12/0.12 microg/mL, doripenem 0.25/0.25 microg/ml, and chloramphenicil 1/2 microg/mL against H. influenza.
