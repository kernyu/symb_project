Understanding molecular mechanisms involved in melanoma resistance to drugs is a big challenge. Experimental evidences suggested a correlation between mutational status in B-RAF and melanoma cell susceptibility to drugs, such as paclitaxel, doxorubicin and temozolomide, which generate an accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the cells. We investigated the survival phenotype and the protein level of c-myc, a B-RAF target molecule, in melanoma cells, carrying a different mutational status in B-RAF, upon paclitaxel, doxorubicin and H2O2 treatment. For the first time, we reported c-myc modulation is critical for melanoma drug response. It appeared drug-specific and post-transcriptionally driven through PP2A; in correlation, cell pre-treatment with okadaic acid (OA), a specific PP2A inhibitor, as well as PP2A silencing of melanoma cells, was able to increase melanoma cell drug-sensitivity and c-myc protein level. This is relevant for designing efficacious therapeutic strategies in melanoma.
