OBJECTIVES: Klebsiella species has been regarded as a major pathogen that causes infections in humans and various animals. Here, we report the draft genome sequence of a CTX-M-type beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella quasipneumoniae subsp. similipneumoniae strain CHKP0062 that was isolated from a yellow-margined Box Turtle. METHODS: An Illumina-Solexa platform was used to sequence the genome of CHKP0062. Qualified reads were assembled de novo using Velvet. The draft genome was annotated by the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline. Resistome and virulome were investigated. RESULTS: A total of 5,423 protein-coding sequences, 87 tRNAs, 24 rRNAs, and 12 ncRNAs, were identified in the 5,699,275bp genome. CHKP0062 is assigned to sequence type (ST) 2131 with the K-loci type as KL67. No virulence-associated genes were identified. However, numerous antimicrobial resistance genes were present in this strain. Plasmid contigs were assembled and revealed homology to the multiple-drug resistance plasmids pC15-K, pCTX-M3, and pKF3-94, with the carriage of the class A beta-lactamase genes, blaTEM-1b and blaCTX-M-3. CONCLUSION: The genome sequence reported in this study will be useful for comparative genomic analysis regarding the dissemination of clinically important antibiotic resistance genes among Klebsiella species isolated from humans and animals.
