The microbial resistance has become a global hazard with the irrational use of antibiotics. Infection of drug-resistant bacteria seriously threatens human health. Currently, there is an urgent need for the development of novel antimicrobial agents with new mechanisms and lower levels of toxicity. In this paper, a series of (S ,Z)-4-methyl-2-(4-oxo-5-((5-substitutedphenylfuran-2-yl) methylene)-2-thioxothiazolidin-3-yl)pentanoic acids via a Knoevenagel condensation were synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial activity in - vitro. The synthesized compounds were characterized by IR, (1)H NMR and MS. The antibacterial test in - vitro showed that all of the synthesized compounds had good antibacterial activity against several Gram-positive bacteria (including multidrug-resistant clinical isolates) with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values in the range of 2-4 microg/mL. Especially compounds 4c, 4d, 4e and 4f were the most potent, with MIC values of 2 microg/mL against four multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacterial strains.
