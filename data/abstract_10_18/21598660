Mutants of Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovra 48A carrying plasmid pCA25 and its transposon variant and resistant to mitomycin C, nalidixic acid and streptomycin were used in the research. It has been shown that the presence of transposon in plasmid pCA25 (strain 48A-7/4b[pCA25::Tn9]) does not practically affect the frequency of appearance of the stable bacterial mutants under the effect of all three antibiotics. Several variants, the plasmid profile of which differs from the initial one were found only in the case of this strain clones resistant to mitomycin C. Electrophoretic mobility of the plasmid DNA of the mutant clones 31 and 32 decreased and approached mobility of the initial plasmid pCA25, the mutant plasmid 13 had high electrophoretic mobility compared to pCA25::Tn9. Some plasmids are the deletion variants of pCA25::Tn9, one of two IS1-elements of the transposon Tn9 being absent in them. The obtained results indicate that the studied plasmid pCA25 is stable, is not eliminated from the cells under different treatments and confirm once more the hypothesis of the prophage origin of the plasmid. The paper is presented in Russian.
