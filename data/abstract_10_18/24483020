To investigate the current status of drug-resistant bacteria (except MRSA) in Kumamoto prefecture, a study was conducted to determine the isolation numbers and ratios of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-Escherichia coli, ESBL-Klebsiella species, ESBL-Proteus mirabilis, two-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, (resistant to two drugs either carbapenems, quinolones and aminoglycosides) multi-drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, multi-drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, and vancomyacin-resistant Enterococcii in eight general hospitals from May in 2009 to April in 2010. ESBL-E. coli was mostly isolated, and two-drug resistant P. aeruginosa came second. The isolation ratio of overall drug-resistant bacteria did not increase, while the isolation ratio of two-drugs resistant P. aeruginosa declined, suggesting that infection control was successfully conducted in these hospitals. However, the isolation numbers of ESBL-Klebsiella spp. and two-drug resistant P. aeruginosa were variable in each hospital. Furthermore, drug-resistant bacteria were occasionally spread into another medical facilities by patients transferred from these hospitals, indicating that sharing information on drug-resistant bacteria between medical facilities is required.
