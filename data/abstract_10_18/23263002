Fosfomycin is a potential option for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) infections despite limited in vitro and clinical data. In this study, 32 VRE isolates from renal transplant patients with urinary stent infections were susceptible to fosfomycin, daptomycin, and linezolid and resistant to amoxicillin, minocycline, and nitrofurantoin based on their MIC(50)s and MIC(90)s. Fosfomycin was bacteriostatic at 0.5 to 16x the MIC (32 to 2,048 mug/ml); synergy occurred when fosfomycin was combined with daptomycin (2.8 to 3.9 log(10) CFU/ml kill; P < 0.001) or amoxicillin (2.6 to 3.4; P < 0.05). These combinations may be potent options to treat VRE urinary infections pending investigation of clinical efficacy.
