Presence of Staphylococcus aureus, antibiotic resistance pattern and PCR detection of mecA gene in isolated strains were investigated in total of 256 packaged hamburgers in Iran-Tehran. For this purpose we used standard disk-diffusion method and sensitive and specific PCR technique, respectively. Results showed that 25% of samples were positive for S. aureus. Resistance to meticillin, erythromycin, penicillin G, cefazolin, ciprofloxasin, vacomycin and amoxiclave was determined 89%, 20.3%, 18.7%, 15.6%, 14%, 26.6% and 12.5%, respectively. According to the obtained results from PCR analysis of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), mecA gene was present in 100% of the resistant isolates, 0% of intermediate-resistance isolates and 25% of susceptible isolates. The results obtained from PCR detection of mecA gene showed high correlation with standard disk diffusion test.
