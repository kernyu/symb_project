The primed mobilization for more potent defense responses to subsequent stress has been shown for many plant species, but there is a growing need to identify reliable molecular markers for this unique phenomenon. In the present study a proteomic approach was used to screen similarities in protein abundance in leaves of primed potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) treated with four well-known inducers of plant resistance, i.e. beta-aminobutyric acid (BABA), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), Laminarin and 2,6-dichloroisonicotinic acid (INA), respectively. Moreover, to gain insight into the importance of nitric oxide (NO) in primed protein accumulation the potato leaves were supplied by S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), as an NO donor. The comparative analysis, using two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, revealed that among 25 proteins accumulated specifically after BABA, GABA, INA and Laminarin treatments, 13 proteins were accumulated also in response to GSNO. Additionally, overlapping proteomic changes between BABA-primed and GSNO-treated leaves showed 5 protein spots absent in the proteome maps obtained in response to the other priming agents. The identified 18 proteins belonged, in most cases, to functional categories of primary metabolism. The selected proteins including three redox-regulated enzymes, i.e. glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, carbonic anhydrase, and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, were discussed in relation to the plant defence responses. Taken together, the overlapping effects in the protein profiles obtained between priming agents, GSNO and cPTIO treatments provide insight indicating that the primed potato exhibits unique changes in the primary metabolism, associated with selective protein modification via NO.
