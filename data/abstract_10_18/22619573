AIM: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated from human bone marrow (hBM) and adipose tissue (hAT) are perceived as attractive sources of stem cells for cell therapy. The aim of this study was to compare MSCs from hBM and hAT for their immunocytochemistry staining and resistance to in vitro apoptosis. METHODS: In our study, we investigated the antiapoptotic ability of these MSCs toward oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and serum deprivation. Results were assessed by MTT and flow cytometry. All experiments were repeated a minimum of three times. RESULTS: Flow cytometry and MTT analysis revealed that hAT-MSCs exhibited a higher resistance toward H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis (n = 3, hBM-hAT viability H(2)O(2) 58.43 +/- 1.24-73.02 +/- 1.44, P < 0.02) and to serum-deprivation-induced apoptosis at days 1 and 4 than the hBM-MSCs (n = 3, hAT-hBM absorbance, resp., day 1: 0.305 +/- 0.027-0.234 +/- 0.015, P = 0.029, day 4: 0.355 +/- 0.003-0.318 +/- 0.007, P = 0.001, and day 7: 0.400 +/- 0.017-0.356 +/- 0.008, P = 0.672). hAT-MSCs showed superior tolerance to oxidative stress triggered by 2 mmol/L H(2)O(2) and also have superior antiapoptosis capacity toward serum-free culture. CONCLUSION: In this study we found that hAT-MSCs are more resistant to in vitro apoptosis.
