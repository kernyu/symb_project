The ingestion of antimicrobial residues in foods of animal origin has the potential risk of exposing colonic bacteria to small concentrations of antibiotics and inducing resistance in the colonic bacteria. To investigate whether human intestinal contents would influence resistance development in bacteria, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 (MIC of enrofloxacin <0.03 mug ml(-1)) was exposed to 0.01 to 1 mug ml(-1) of enrofloxacin in media supplemented with glucose, sucrose, sodium acetate or sterilized human fecal extract. In the first passage, only the medium containing sterilized fecal extract supported the growth of E. coli at an enrofloxacin concentration equal to the MIC. In the second and third passages following exposure to sub-inhibitory concentrations of the drug, the bacteria in media containing sterilized fecal extract grew at 0.1 mug ml(-1) of enrofloxacin. The efflux pump inhibitors, reserpine and carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), increased the sensitivity of bacteria to 0.1 mug ml(-1) of enrofloxacin in the medium containing sucrose, but their effect was not observed in the medium supplemented with 2.5% sterilized fecal extract. The proportions of unsaturated and saturated fatty acids in E. coli grown in the medium with 2.5% sterilized fecal extract differed from those grown in the medium alone. Fecal extract may contain unknown factors that augment the ability of E. coli to grow in concentrations of enrofloxacin higher than MIC, both in the presence and absence of efflux pump inhibitors. This is the first study showing that fecal extract affects the level of sensitivity of E. coli to antimicrobial agents.
