The CONSTITUTIVE EXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENES5 (CPR5) gene of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) encodes a putative membrane protein of unknown biochemical function and displays highly pleiotropic functions, particularly in pathogen responses, cell proliferation, cell expansion, and cell death. Here, we demonstrate a link between CPR5 and the GLABRA1 ENHANCER BINDING PROTEIN (GeBP) family of transcription factors. We investigated the primary role of the GeBP/GeBP-like (GPL) genes using transcriptomic analysis of the quadruple gebp gpl1,2,3 mutant and one overexpressing line that displays several cpr5-like phenotypes including dwarfism, spontaneous necrotic lesions, and increased pathogen resistance. We found that GeBP/GPLs regulate a set of genes that represents a subset of the CPR5 pathway. This subset includes genes involved in response to stress as well as cell wall metabolism. Analysis of the quintuple gebp gpl1,2,3 cpr5 mutant indicates that GeBP/GPLs are involved in the control of cell expansion in a CPR5-dependent manner but not in the control of cell proliferation. In addition, to our knowledge, we provide the first evidence that the CPR5 protein is localized in the nucleus of plant cells and that a truncated version of the protein with no transmembrane domain can trigger cpr5-like processes when fused to the VP16 constitutive transcriptional activation domain. Our results provide clues on how CPR5 and GeBP/GPLs play opposite roles in the control of cell expansion and suggest that the CPR5 protein is involved in transcription.
