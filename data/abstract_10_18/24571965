The Lon ATP-dependent protease plays an important role in regulating many biological processes in bacteria. In this study, we examined the organic solvent tolerance of a Deltalon mutant of Escherichia coli K-12 and found that the mutant showed remarkably higher organic solvent tolerance than the parent strain. Deltalon mutants are known to overproduce capsular polysaccharide, resulting in the formation of mucoid colonies. We considered that this increase in capsular polysaccharide production might be involved in the organic solvent tolerance in E. coli. However, a DeltalonDeltawcaJ double-gene mutant displaying a nonmucoid phenotype was as tolerant to organic solvents as the Deltalon mutant, suggesting that capsular polysaccharide is not involved in organic solvent tolerance. On the other hand, the Lon protease is known to exhibit proteolytic activity against the transcriptional activators MarA and SoxS, which can enhance the expression level of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump. We found that the Deltalon mutant showed a higher expression level of AcrB than the parent strain. In addition, the DeltalonDeltaacrB double-gene mutant showed a significant decrease in organic solvent tolerance. Thus, it was shown that organic solvent tolerance in the Deltalon mutant depends on the AcrAB-TolC pump but not capsular polysaccharide. E. coli strain JA300 acrRIS marR overexpresses the AcrAB-TolC pump and exhibits high-level solvent tolerance. In an attempt to further improve the solvent tolerance of JA300 acrRIS marR, a lon gene disruptant of this strain was constructed. However, the resulting mutant JA300 acrRIS marR Deltalon showed lower solvent tolerance than JA300 acrRIS marR.
