Scedosporium prolificans is a fungus that has demonstrated resistance against most currently available antifungal agents and which causes a rapidly disseminating and potentially fatal infection. A 68-year-old woman presented with a fever and consolidation in the lung field. Her symptoms and inflammatory reaction did not improve despite treatment with tazobactam/piperacillin, meropenem, and micafungin. Scedosporium prolificans was detected from the patient's bronchial lavage fluid, and we initiated treatment with voriconazole. Voriconazole was effective in shrinking the consolidation and suppressing the inflammatory reaction. The residual lesion was surgically resected because of the risk of systemic dissemination. The patient is currently alive without relapse or dissemination.
