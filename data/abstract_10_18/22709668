BACKGROUND: The present work was designed to evaluate the antibacterial properties of the methanol extracts of eleven selected Cameroonian spices on multi-drug resistant bacteria (MDR), and their ability to potentiate the effect of some common antibiotics used in therapy. RESULTS: The extract of Cinnamomum zeylanicum against Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 and AG100 strains showed the best activities, with the lowest minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 64 mug/ml. The extract of Dorstenia psilurus was the most active when tested in the presence of an efflux pump inhibitor, phenylalanine Arginine-beta- Naphtylamide (PAbetaN), a synergistic effect being observed in 56.25 % of the tested bacteria when it was combined with erythromycin (ERY). CONCLUSION: The present work evidently provides information on the role of some Cameroonian spices in the fight against multi-resistant bacteria.
