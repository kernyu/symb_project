Mutations in the Pfcrt gene that change the resulting amino acids and form different haplotypes are common and correlate with the prevalence of chloroquine resistant (CQR) field isolates of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. This correlation provides opportunities to infer the global evolutionary history of CQ resistance by analysing CQR Pfcrt haplotype data. We collated data on the Pfcrt haplotypes from different global studies and performed evolutionary genetic analysis to present comprehensive and comparative information on the global distribution of five major CQR-Pfcrt haplotypes and evolutionary inter-relationships among 38 different countries. Using the haplotype diversity data, inter-continental genetic differentiation was also ascertained.
