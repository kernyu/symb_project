We applied an efficient method to characterize the relative fitness levels of multiple nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase (NNRTI)-resistant HIV-1 variants by simultaneous competitive culture and 454 deep sequencing. Using this method, we show that the Y181V mutation in the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase in particular confers a clear selective advantage to the virus over 14 other NNRTI resistance mutations in the presence of etravirine in vitro.
