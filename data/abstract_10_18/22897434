AIM: To determine whether novobiocin resistance strategy could be used to attenuate a virulent Aeromonas hydrophila AH11P strain and to characterize the growth and pathogenic differences between the novobiocin-resistant strain and its virulent parent strain AH11P. METHODS AND RESULTS: A novobiocin-resistant strain AH11NOVO was obtained from a virulent Aer. hydrophila strain AH11P through selection of resistance to novobiocin. AH11NOVO was found to be avirulent to channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), whereas AH11P was virulent. When AH11NOVO vaccinated channel catfish were challenged with AH11P at 14 days postvaccination, relative per cent of survival of vaccinated fish was 100%. The cell proliferation rate of AH11NOVO was found to be significantly (P < 0.05) less than that of AH11P. In vitro motility assay revealed that AH11NOVO was nonmotile, whereas AH11P was motile. AH11NOVO had significantly (P < 0.05) lower in vitro chemotactic response to catfish mucus than that of AH11P. Although the ability of AH11NOVO to attach catfish gill cells was similar to that of AH11P, the ability of AH11NOVO to invade catfish gill cells was significantly (P < 0.05) lower than that of AH11P. CONCLUSIONS: The novobiocin-resistant AH11NOVO is attenuated and different from its parent AH11P in pathogenicity. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The significantly lower chemotactic response and invasion ability of AH11NOVO compared with that of its virulent parent strain AH11P might shed light on the pathogenesis of Aer. hydrophila.
