BACKGROUND & AIMS: We compared the mortality and treatment response between lamivudine (LAM) and entecavir (ETV) in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with severe acute exacerbation and hepatic decompensation. METHODS: From 2003 to 2010 (the LAM group) and 2008 to 2010 (the ETV group), 215 and 107 consecutive CHB naive patients with severe acute exacerbation and hepatic decompensation treated with LAM and ETV respectively, were recruited. RESULTS: At baseline, the LAM group had higher AST levels and end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores, and lower albumin levels than the ETV group. Univariate analysis showed that the LAM group had a higher rate of overall (p=0.02) and liver-related mortality (p=0.052) at week 24 than the ETV group, including in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure. Multivariate analysis showed that MELD scores, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy were independent factors for overall and liver-related mortality at week 24. ETV or LAM treatment was not an independent factor for mortality in all patients or patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure. The best cut-off value of MELD scores were 24 for 24-week liver-related mortality. The ETV group achieved better virological response (HBV DNA <300 copies/ml) than the LAM group at week 24 (p=0.043) and 48 (p=0.007). The T1753C/A mutation was also an independent predictor associated with overall and liver-related mortality at week 24. CONCLUSIONS: The choice between ETV and LAM was not an independent factor for mortality in CHB patients with acute exacerbation and hepatic decompensation. Patients with ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and MELD scores 24 were associated with poor outcome and should be considered for liver transplantation.
