KEY POINTS: 1. The treatment of rejection is an important factor associated with the severe recurrence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) after liver transplantation. 2. The effects of calcineurin inhibitors, corticosteroids, and mycophenolate mofetil on HCV recurrence are equivocal. 3. Cyclosporine is associated with a higher sustained virological response in patients treated for HCV. 4. Because insulin resistance and diabetes are associated with fibrosis in HCV-infected liver transplant recipients, the use of immunosuppressive agents without this side effect may slow the posttransplant disease progression.
