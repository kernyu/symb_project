We report three cases of recently named Bacteroides spp. isolates, two B. faecis isolates and one B. intestinalis isolate from clinical specimens of inpatients at a Korean tertiary-care hospital in 2011. All isolates were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, meropenem, chloramphenicol, and metronidazole.
