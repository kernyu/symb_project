BACKGROUND: Fluoroquinolone-resistant and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-carrying multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli have become severely problematic. In particular, a lineage of multilocus sequence-type ST131 which belongs to O25:H4 and carries ESBL CTX-M-15 has spread worldwide. METHODS: Fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli strains were isolated from various clinical specimens in a commercial clinical laboratory in 2008 and 2009 in Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan. RESULTS: Among 478 clinical isolates, 112 strains (23.4%) showed levofloxacin (LVX) resistance. About 80% of the fluoroquinolone-resistant strains (88 strains) showed common features, namely O25:H4-ST131, phylogenetic group B and the same mutation pattern in quinolone resistance-determining regions. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis patterns suggested numerous lineages of O25:H4-ST131. The fluoroquinolone-resistant strains, including strains of O25:H4-ST131 and other types, more frequently shared CTX-type ESBL genes than did fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains. The ESBL genes fell into the CTX-M-9 and CTX-M-2 groups. CTX-M-15 (CTX-M-1 group) was not found among any of the strains isolated in this study. Sitafloxacin showed markedly potent activity against E. coli isolates compared with LVX, ciprofloxacin and ulifloxacin. CONCLUSION: The most prevalent fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of E. coli isolated in Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan, are O25:H4-ST131. However, similar to other areas of Japan, the ST131 clones represent distinct lineages from the general worldwide dispersal of multidrug-resistant clones which carry CTX-M-15.
