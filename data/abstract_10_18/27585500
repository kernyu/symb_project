Most of the drugs used for the treatment of trichinellosis show a limited bioavailability and a high degree of resistance. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize the anthelmintic potential activity of nitazoxanide (NTZ) in a rat model of experimental trichinellosis. Animals were divided into three groups; group I, infected and non-treated; group II, received NTZ for three days post-infection (dpi) and group III, received NTZ 30 dpi for 14 consecutive days. Treatment efficacy was assessed by Trichinella spiralis adult and larval counts, histopathological studies of the small intestine and muscles and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in the small intestine. T. spiralis adult count was reduced in NTZ -treated group (66.6%) and the larval count decreased to 68.7 and 76.7% in the early and late treatment, respectively. The infected non-treated rats showed massive inflammatory cellular infiltration in the small intestines and muscles. This inflammatory response was minor in the treated groups and was accompanied by a decrease in iNOS expression. Moreover, in group III, the larvae were replaced by homogenized substance with some destructive changes in the capsule. In conclusion, NTZ showed a promising activity against enteral and more effect in parenteral phases of trichinellosis.
