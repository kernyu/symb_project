A 75-year-old man (not a contact lens wearer) presented with Fusarium-associated hypopyon keratitis. After several weeks of empirical and subsequently targeted antimycotic treatment, no considerable improvement was observed. However, after sclerokeratoplasty (11.2 x 11.2 mm) combined with prolonged antimycotic therapy a good local result with relapse-free long-term follow-up was achieved.
