The efficacy of entecavir (ETV) treatment in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients who were exposed to lamivudine (LAM) but had no detectable LAM resistance (LAM-R) is not well evaluated. In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether the probability of developing genotypic resistance to ETV in LAM-exposed patients with or without LAM-R is comparable to that in antiviral-naive patients. This retrospective cohort study included 500 consecutive patients with CHB who started ETV monotherapy at a single tertiary hospital in Korea. The patients were divided into three groups: nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA)-naive patients (group 1, n=142), patients who were previously exposed to LAM and had no currently or previously detected LAM-R (group 2, n=233), and patients with LAM-R when starting ETV (group 3, n=125). The overall median ETV treatment duration was 48.7 months. The probabilities of virologic breakthrough were significantly increased not only in group 3 (hazard ratio [HR]=14.4, P<0.001) but also in group 2 (HR=5.0, P<0.001) compared to group 1. Genotypic ETV resistance (ETV-R) developed more frequently in group 2 (HR=13.0, P=0.013) as well as group 3 (HR=43.9, P<0.001) than in group 1: the probabilities of developing ETV-R in groups 1, 2, and 3 were <1.0%, 8.0%, and 28.2%, respectively, at month 48. The results of this study indicate that ETV-R occurred more frequently in LAM-exposed patients, even though they had no detectable LAM-R, than in NA-naive patients. Therefore, LAM-exposed CHB patients, regardless of the presence or absence of LAM-R, should be monitored more cautiously for the development of ETV-R during ETV monotherapy.
