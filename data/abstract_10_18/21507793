Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) have many risk factors for resistant pathogens such as prolonged length of stay, frequent and broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy, presence of foreign materials, and proximity with other patients. However, of the risk factors associated with acquisition of resistant pathogens, inappropriate use of antimicrobial agents has been the most implicated. Thus, many health care institutions have adopted antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) as a mechanism to ensure more appropriate antimicrobial use. ASPs can have a significant impact in the ICU, leading to improved antimicrobial use and resistance patterns and decreased infection rates and costs, due to the inherent nature of infections encountered and high and often inappropriate antibiotic utilization in this setting. However, certain challenges exist for ASPs in the ICU including issues with infrastructure and personnel, information technology, the core ASP strategy, patient-specific factors, conversion of intravenous to oral therapy, and dose optimization. The combination of comprehensive infection control (IC) and effective antimicrobial stewardship can prevent the emergence of resistance among microorganisms and may decrease the negative consequences associated with antimicrobial misuse.
