Elizabethkingia meningoseptica is a recognised cause of meningitis in premature neonates and severe infections in immunocompromised adults; multi-drug resistance is a major issue. A premature infant developed sepsis, meningitis and hydrocephalus owing to E. meningoseptica and was treated successfully with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) for 3 weeks. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt was required for hydrocephalus. This is the youngest patient with meningitis caused by E. meningoseptica to have responded to TMP-SMZ.
