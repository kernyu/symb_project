Most efforts in the development of antimicrobials have focused on the screening of lethal targets. Nevertheless, the constant expansion of antimicrobial resistance makes the antibiotic resistance determinants themselves suitable targets for finding inhibitors to be used in combination with antibiotics. Among them, inhibitors of antibiotic inactivating enzymes and of multidrug efflux pumps are suitable candidates for improving the efficacy of antibiotics. In addition, the application of systems biology tools is helping to understand the changes in bacterial physiology associated to the acquisition of resistance, including the increased susceptibility to other antibiotics displayed by some antibiotic-resistant mutants. This information is useful for implementing novel strategies based in metabolic interventions or combination of antibiotics for improving the efficacy of antibacterial therapy.
