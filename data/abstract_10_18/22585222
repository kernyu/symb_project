LTX-109 and eight other antimicrobial agents were evaluated against 155 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates, including strains resistant to vancomycin and strains with decreased susceptibility to daptomycin and linezolid, by microdilution tests to determine MICs. Time-kill assays were performed against representative MRSA, vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA), and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) isolates. LTX-109 demonstrated a MIC range of 2 to 4 mug/ml and dose-dependent rapid bactericidal activity against S. aureus. This activity was not influenced by resistance to other antistaphylococcal agents.
