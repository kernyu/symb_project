With the abuse of clinical broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents, immunosuppressive agents, chemotherapy drugs, the emergence of pathogenic fungi resistance is more and more frequent. However, there is still no effective treatment for the fungal resistance. Squalenee epoxidase (SE) and 14 alpha-demethylase (CYP51) are important antifungal drug targets. In order to achieve a deeper insight into the structural characteristics and the action modes of SE and CYP51inhibitors, the homology model of SE (Candida albicans) was constructed using monooxygenase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa as template, and the reliability of model was confirmed by Ramachandran plots and Verify 3D. Subsequently, the molecular superimposition and molecular docking were performed, and the pharmacophore model based on the CYP51 receptor structure was constructed. The results indicate that SE and CYP51 inhibitors have common structural feature with two parts of essential fragments, which are mainly composed of aromatic groups. In addition, the fragment structures of inhibitors are combined in the similar hydrophobic pockets through the hydrophobic forces. The present study provides a deeper perspective to understand the characteristics and docking modes of SE and CYP51 inhibitors. It can be used to guide the optimization and design of SE and CYP51 inhibitors. In addition, it also provides the oretical support for the development of dual target antifungal inhibitors (SE and CYP51), which can help us solve the problem of fungi resistance.
