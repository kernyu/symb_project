In tobacco, 9-divinyl ethers (DVEs) produced by the lipoxygenase NtLOX1 and DVE synthase NtDES1 are important for full resistance to pathogens. In this work, the regulation of NtLOX1 and NtDES1 expression by signal molecules was investigated in LOX1 promoter-reporter transgenic plants and by RT-qPCR. Methyl jasmonate, ACC and elicitor were shown to coordinately trigger the DVE pathway. Induction was strongly attenuated in the presence of salicylic acid, which seems to act as a negative regulator of the 9-DVE biosynthetic enzymes. Our data suggest that, in tobacco, DVE biosynthesis is cross-regulated by jasmonates, and by other hormonal and signal molecules such as ethylene and SA.
