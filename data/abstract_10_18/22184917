Enterobacter spp. rods are opportunistic microorganisms which cause of urinary tract infections. The aim of this study was the evaluation of the susceptibility to antimicrobial agents antibiotics of Enterobacter spp. rods isolated from urine. The study was carried 50 of Enterobacter spp strains isolated in the Clinical Microbiology Department of dr. A. Jurasz University Hospital. Antibiotic susceptibility was tested by disk diffusion method. All of strains were susceptible to imipenem and meropenem. There was 87,5% of strains sensitive to doripenem, 79,2% to ertapenem, 54,0% to piperacillin/tazobactam and 50,0% to cephepime. The relatively high percentage (62,0%) of Enterobacter spp. was sensitive to fluoroquinolones. Extended spectrum beta-lactamases were produced by 24 (48,0%) strains.
