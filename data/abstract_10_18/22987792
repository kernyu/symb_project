Silver has antiseptic properties, anti-inflammatory properties, and is a broad-spectrum antibiotic for multidrug-resistant strains of bacteria. The commercially available product, Silverlon(R), is a silver-plated three-dimensional polyamide fabric with a high silver concentration of 546 mg/100 cm(2). Thus, fibroblast cell growth is affected when exposed to the Silverlon(R) treated cell medium. Our study produced an activated carbon fiber wound dressing that incorporated various silver concentrations (in cooperation of Bio-Medical Carbon Technology) to examine antimicrobial properties and determine fibroblast cell viability upon exposure to the silver impregnated dressing material as compared to other commercially available products such as calcium alginate dressing, Sorbalgon(R), and silver-polyamide fabric dressing, Silverlon(R). The silver impregnated activated carbon fiber dressing induced less damage to fibroblast cells compared to the effect produced by Silverlon(R) and exhibited similar antibacterial abilities in vitro. An in vivo analysis showed that various silver concentrations impregnated activated carbon fiber dressings promoted tissue reconstruction for wound healing in rats with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infected wounds.
