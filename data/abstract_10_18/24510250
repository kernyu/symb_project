M33 is a branched peptide currently under preclinical characterization for the development of a new antibacterial drug against gram-negative bacteria. Here, we report its pegylation at the C-terminus of the three-lysine-branching core and the resulting increase in stability to Pseudomonas aeruginosa elastase. This protease is a virulence factor that acts by destroying peptides of the native immune system. Peptide resistance to this protease is an important feature for M33-Peg activity against Pseudomonas.
