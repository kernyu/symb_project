BACKGROUND: Cidofovir is an antiviral agent which inhibits the DNA polymerase of different viruses. Its use has been described for papillomavirus infections. METHODS: Descriptive retrospective study, including patients with difficult to treat anogenital warts who were treated with cidofovir cream. RESULTS: Nine immunocompetent patients were treated, where 6 of them had a complete response and 3 of them a partial response. CONCLUSION: Cidofovir cream could be a useful therapeutic alternative, although further studies are required to establish the best dosage and its cost-effectiveness.
