In 2008 isolates of KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-KPN) were detected for the first time at Hospital Heliopolis, Sao Paulo, Brazil. The aim of this study was to characterize the clinical and microbiological outcomes of infections caused by KPC-KPN. A historical cohort of patients from whom KPC-KPN strains were isolated was performed. Isolates were identified as resistant to ertapenem by automated broth microdilution system and screened as carbapenemase producers by the modified Hodge test. The beta-lactamase resistance gene blaKPC was detected by PCR. The genetic relatedness of isolates was determined by PFGE. The study provides early clinical experience in treating KPC-KPN infections in a Brazilian tertiary center.
