With the increasing emergence of resistant fungi, the discovery and development of novel antifungal therapeutics were urgently needed. Compared with conventional antibiotics, the limited propensity of AMPs to induce resistance in pathogens has attracted great interest. In the present study, the antifungal activity and its mechanism-of-action of polybia-MPI, a cationic peptide from the venom of Social wasp Polybia Paulista was investigated. We demonstrated that polybia-MPI could potently inhibit the growth of Candida albicans (C. albicans) and Candida glabrata (C. glabrata). The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of Polybia-MPI against cancer cells were much higher than the MICs against the tested C. albicans and C. glabrata cells, indicating that polybia-MPI had high selectivity between the fungal and mammalian cells. Our results also indicated that membrane disturbance mechanism was involved in the antifungal activity. Furthermore, polybia-MPI could inhibit the bio film forming of C. glabrata, which was frequently associated with clinically significant biofilm. These results suggest that polybia-MPI has great advantages in the development of antifungal agents.
