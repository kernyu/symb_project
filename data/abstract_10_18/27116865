In the present study we wanted to show that bacterial infections are an important factor threatening both the health and life of humans. This problem concerns the global population, both in developed and developing countries, and is often the cause of a significant proportion of deaths due to the negative impact of exo- and endotoxins on the host. Numerous infectious diseases caused by biological factors are undoubtedly associated with various risk factors. Despite the continuous development of medicine and countless actions spreading knowledge about bacterial gastrointestinal infections and sepsis, these conditions are still not marginal in the everyday hospital environment. Particular attention in this work was put on hospital infections because they are a major public health concern. Although a significant increase in awareness of the problem has been observed in Poland in recent years, this is still an important problem for medicine, and is also an economic issue. In addition, bacteria and their toxins can be used as a biological weapon for terrorist attacks.
