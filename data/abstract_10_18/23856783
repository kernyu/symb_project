In recent decades, Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as an organism of great concern due to its ability to accumulate antibiotic resistance. In order to improve the diagnosis of resistance determinants in A. baumannii in terms of lead time and accuracy, we developed a microarray that can be used to detect 91 target sequences associated with antibiotic resistance within 4 h from bacterial culture to result. The array was validated with 60 multidrug-resistant strains of A. baumannii in a blinded, prospective study. The results were compared to phenotype results determined by the automated susceptibility testing system VITEK2. Antibiotics considered were piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, imipenem, meropenem, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, and tigecycline. The average positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity, and specificity were 98, 98, 99, and 94%, respectively. For carbapenemase genes, the array results were compared to singleplex PCR results provided by the German National Reference Center for Gram-Negative Pathogens, and results were in complete concordance. The presented array is able to detect all relevant resistance determinants of A. baumannii in parallel. The short handling time of 4 h from culture to result helps to provide fast results in order to initiate adequate anti-infective therapy for critically ill patients. Another application would be data acquisition for epidemiologic surveillance.
