Tuberculosis (TB), an epidemic disease, affects the world with death rate of two million people every year. The bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis was found to be a more potent and disease-prolonged bacterium among the world due to multi-drug resistance. Emergence of new drug targets is needed to overcome the bacterial resistance that leads to control epidemic tuberculosis. The pathway thiamine biosynthesis was targeting M. tuberculosis due to its role in intracellular growth of the bacterium. The screening of enzymes involved in thiamin biosynthesis showed novel target thiazole synthase (ThiG) involved in catalysis of rearrangement of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) to produce the thiazole phosphate moiety of thiamine. We carried out homology modeling for ThiG to understand the structure-function relationship, and the model was refined with MD simulations. The results showed that the model predicted with (alpha + beta)8-fold of synthase family proteins. Molecular docking of ThiG model with substrate DXP showed binding mode and key residues ARG46, ASN69, THR41, and LYS96 involved in the catalysis. First-line anti-tuberculosis drugs were docked with ThiG to identify the inhibition. The report showed the anti-tuberculosis drugs interact well with ThiG which may lead to block thiamin biosynthesis pathway.
