In this paper, we present some elements of our optimization program to decouple triclosan's specific FabI effect from its nonspecific cytotoxic component. The implementation of this strategy delivered highly specific, potent, and nonbiocidal new FabI inhibitors. We also disclose some preclinical data of one of their representatives, 83, a novel antibacterial compound active against resistant staphylococci and some clinically relevant Gram negative bacteria that is currently undergoing clinical trials.
