Morganella morganii is a rare cause of peritonitis in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD). Most of the reported cases have resorted to a switch to hemodialysis. We herein report a case of peritonitis due to M. morganii resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, which was treated successfully with intraperitoneal (IP) tobramycin followed by oral ciprofloxacin. Early microbiologic diagnosis is essential in the treatment of peritonitis from rare microorganisms such as Morganella morganii, and appropriate antibiotic therapy is the key to avoiding catheter loss and subsequent switch to hemodialysis.
