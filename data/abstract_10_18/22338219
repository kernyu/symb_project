OBJECTIVE: To analyze the mutation patters of HBV P gene and genotyping of heptitis B virus in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) after the emergence of drug-resistance during lamivudine (LAM) therapy. METHODS: LAM-resistant mutations and genotype of HBV were dectected in patients with LAM-resistant CHB in our hospital from Sep. 2008 to June. 2010. RESULT: 107 patients had 8 mutation patterns. YMDD mutations happened in 100%, only YMDD mutation were 43 patients, while others were YMDD combined with rtL180M mutations; the HBV genotype among 107chronic hepatitis was mainly B (25.2%) and C (73.8%) and only 1 patient was happend B and C mixed infection. Genetype C was mainly YMDD combined with rtL180M mutations pattern, the rate is 60.7% (48/79); while genetype B was mainly rtM204 mutation pattern, the rate is 66.7% (18/27); there were significant difference between the genetype B and C in mutation pattern (chi2 = 8.4, 7.2, respectively, P < 0. 01). CONCLUSION: YMDD mutation is the major mutation pattern of HBV P gene after emergence of LAM-resistance. Genotypes of hepatitis B virus can determine the related mulation patterns of HBV P gene.
