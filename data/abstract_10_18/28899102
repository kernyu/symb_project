Treatment of HIV has reduced HIV/AIDS-related mortality. Sustaining >90% virologic suppression in sub-Saharan Africa requires decentralized care and prevention services to rural communities. In Zimbabwe, the number of people receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART) has increased rapidly. However, access to treatment monitoring tools such as viral load and drug resistance testing is limited. We assessed virologic treatment outcomes among ART recipients in Nyamutora, a rural community receiving bimonthly ART and prevention services. We enrolled all ART recipients (143) at 6-monthly visits in the Nyamutora community in 2014 and 2015. Whole blood samples were collected in K-EDTA tubes, transported to Harare for CD4 counts and viral load testing, and genotype was obtained in participants with viral loads >1,000 copies/ml. Ages ranged from 2 to 75 years (median 43 years) with a median 42 months on ART at follow-up. Eight of 143 (6%) had viral loads >1,000 copies/ml at one of the 3 visits, 7 on first-line nevirapine (NVP)-based ART and 1 on second-line LPV/r-based ART. Seven participants had sequence data available, and five had drug resistance mutations, K65R, T69N, K101E, K103N, Y181C/I, M184V, and G190A. Virologic failure (p = .001) and drug resistance mutations (p = .01) on first-line NVP-based ART were associated with younger age by univariate exact logistic regression. The participants had high viral suppression (94%) despite less than optimal (NVP based) ART regimens without laboratory monitoring. Virologic failure and drug resistance were higher among children and adolescents. Effective ART delivery to the community achieved high rates of virologic suppression and minimal drug resistance.
