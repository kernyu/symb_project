INTRODUCTION: Dolutegravir (DGV) is the newest integrase inhibitor approved for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in both treatment-naive and experienced adults and adolescents. This article reviews the safety of DGV for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. AREAS COVERED: The PubMed database was searched using the keywords 'DGV' and 'HIV'. In addition, conference proceedings from Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, International AIDS Society and European AIDS Clinical Society meetings were searched for presentations on DGV clinical studies. EXPERT OPINION: DGV has demonstrated a favorable safety profile and is well tolerated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Unlike raltegravir, DGV can be given once daily, and unlike elvitegravir, it does not require pharmacologic boosting to achieve consistent blood levels.
