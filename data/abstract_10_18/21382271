Plants of cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) furnish edible fruits and derivates that have been used for the prevention and treatment of urinary tract infections. In the present work we compare two commercial extracts that contain proanthocyanins (PACs) at 4 percent and 20 percent for antimicrobial, antiproliferative, antiradical and protective properties against oxidative stress on cell lines. Both extracts showed antimicrobial activity (MIC values range 3-100 microg/ml). Extract at 20 percent PACs showed higher antiproliferative activity against HepG2 and MCF7 cells, but not against C2C12 cells. Both extracts showed a dose-dependent free-radical scavenging capacity, and a protective effect on the cell damage was also revealed by reduction of intracellular active oxygen species release. Cranberry extracts confirmed antioxidative properties and efficacy in reduction of cell viability that resulted stronger against tumor cells. The pretreatment with cranberry extracts, furthermore, reveal an increase of cell resistance against oxidative stress, suggesting a potential role as a dietary supplement in preventing free-radical damage. The proanthocyanidin content is critical to determine the extract efficacy. In cellular experiments the extracts resulted clearly differentiated in their activity, and the activity was strongly influenced by PACs content. Only in DPPH test the free radical scavenging activity seemed to be directly related to proanthocyanidins content.
