The majority of azole resistance mechanisms in Aspergillus fumigatus correspond to mutations in the cyp51A gene. As azoles are less effective against infections caused by multiply azole-resistant A. fumigatus isolates, new therapeutic options are warranted for treating these infections. We therefore investigated the in vitro combination of posaconazole (POSA) and caspofungin (CAS) against 20 wild-type and resistant A. fumigatus isolates with 10 different resistance mechanisms. Fungal growth was assessed with the XTT [2,3-bis (2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide inner salt] method. Pharmacodynamic interactions were assessed with the fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index (FICi) on the basis of 10% (FICi-0), 25% (FICi-1), or 53 0% (FICi-2) growth, and FICs were correlated with POSA and CAS concentrations. Synergy and antagonism were concluded when the FICi values were statistically significantly (t test, P < 0.05) lower than 1 and higher than 1.25, respectively. Significant synergy was found for all isolates with mean FICi-0 values ranging from 0.28 to 0.75 (median, 0.46). Stronger synergistic interactions were found with FICi-1 (median, 0.18; range, 0.07 to 0.47) and FICi-2 (0.31; 0.07 to 0.6). The FICi-2 values of isolates with tandem-repeat-containing mutations or codon M220 were lower than those seen with the other isolates (P < 0.01). FIC-2 values were inversely correlated with POSA MICs (rs = -0.52, P = 0.0006) and linearly with the ratio of drug concentrations in combination over the MIC of POSA (rs = 0.76, P < 0.0001) and CAS (rs = 0.52, P = 0.0004). The synergistic effect of the combination of POSA and CAS (POSA/CAS) against A. fumigatus isolates depended on the underlying azole resistance mechanism. Moreover, the drug combination synergy was found to be increased against isolates with elevated POSA MICs compared to wild-type isolates.
