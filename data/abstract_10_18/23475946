Here, we sought to investigate the vacuole-targeting fungicidal activity of amphotericin B (AmB) in the parent strain and AmB-resistant mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and elucidate the mechanisms involved in this process. Our data demonstrated that the vacuole-targeting fungicidal activity of AmB was markedly enhanced by N-methyl-N''-dodecylguanidine (MC12), a synthetic analogue of the alkyl side chain in niphimycin, as represented by the synergy in their antifungal activities against parent cells of S. cerevisiae. Indifference was observed only with Deltaerg3 cells, indicating that the replacement of ergosterol with episterol facilitated their resistance to the combined lethal actions of AmB and MC12. Dansyl-labelled amphotericin B (AmB-Ds) was concentrated into normal rounded vacuoles when parent cells were treated with AmB-Ds alone, even at a non-lethal concentration. The additional supplementation of MC12 resulted in a marked loss of cell viability and vacuole disruption, as judged by the fluorescence from AmB-Ds scattered throughout the cytoplasm. In Deltaerg3 cells, AmB-Ds was scarcely detected in the cytoplasm, even with the addition of MC12, reflecting its failure to normally incorporate across the plasma membrane into the vacuole. Thus, this study supported the hypothesis that ergosterol is involved in the mobilization of AmB into the vacuolar membrane so that AmB-dependent vacuole disruption can be fully enhanced by cotreatment with MC12.
