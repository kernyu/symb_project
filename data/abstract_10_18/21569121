Antimicrobial resistance was studied in 100 Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains selected randomly from sputum cultures of newly diagnosed tuberculosis patients. Resistance of the isolates to rifampicin, isoniazid, and ethambutol was tested by both drug susceptibility testing (DST) and allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR). A total of 19 (19%) isolates were found resistant to at least one of the antituberculosis drugs investigated by PCR compared with 14 (14%) resistant isolates detected by DST. Eleven mutations were detected by AS-PCR in the rpoB gene (codons 516, 526, and 531), associated with rifampicin resistance, a marker of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), 14 mutations in the katG gene codon 315 that confers resistance to isoniazid, and nine mutations in the embB gene codon 306 that confers resistance to ethambutol. Mutations in the six multidrug-resistant isolates were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Results were compared with phenotypic DST data. Nineteen different mutation types to at least one of the drugs were found; six isolates (6%) were classified as MDR-TB, defined as resistance to at least rifampicin and isoniazid. The rates of concordance of the PCR with the phenotypic susceptibility test were 71.4, 54.5, and 44.4 for isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol, respectively. These results highlight the importance of molecular epidemiology studies of tuberculosis in understudied regions with a tuberculosis burden to uncover the true prevalence of the MDR-TB.
