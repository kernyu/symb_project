Two novel series of spirocyclic piperidine analogs appended to a pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine core were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their anti-HCV activity. A series of piperidine ketals afforded dispiro 6p which showed excellent in vitro anti-HCV activities (EC50 of 1.5nM and 1.2nM against genotype 1a and 1b replicons, respectively). A series of piperidine oxazolidinones afforded 27c which showed EC50's of 10.9nM and 6.1nM against 1a and 1b replicons, respectively. Both compounds 6p and 27c bound directly to non-structural NS4B protein in vitro (IC50's=10.2 and 30.4nM, respectively) and exhibited reduced potency in replicons containing resistance mutations encoding changes in the NS4B protein.
