IFN-gamma plays a critical role in tumor immunosurveillance by affecting either immune cells or tumor cells; however, IFN-mediated effects on tumor elimination are largely unknown. In this study, we showed that IFN regulatory factors (IRF) modulated by IFNs up- and downregulated Noxa expression, a prodeath BH3 protein, in various cancer cells. Inhibition of Noxa expression using short hairpin RNA in tumor cells leads to resistance against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced tumor elimination, in which IFN-gamma is known as a critical effecter in mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis in both CT26 cells and SP2/0 cells, sensitive and resistant to LPS-induced tumor elimination, respectively, revealed that the responsiveness of IRF1, 3, 4, and 7 in the Noxa promoter region in response to IFN-gamma might be crucial in LPS-induced tumor elimination. IRF1, 3, and 7 were upregulated by IFN-gamma and activated Noxa expression, leading to the death of Noxa wild-type baby mouse kidney (BMK) cells but not of Noxa-deficient BMK cells. In contrast, IRF4 acts as a repressor for Noxa expression and inhibits cell death induced by IRF1, 3, or 7. Therefore, although IFN-gamma alone are not able to induce cell death in tumor cells in vitro, Noxa induction by IFN-gamma, which is regulated by the balance between its activators (IRF1, 3, and 7) and its repressor (IRF4), is crucial to increasing the susceptibility of tumor cells to immune cell-mediated cytotoxicity.
