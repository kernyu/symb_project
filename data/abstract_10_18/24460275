AIM: To investigate the effects of diallyl trisulfide (DT) on apoptosis of cisplatin (DDP)-resistant human epithelial ovarian cancer SKOV-3 cells (SKOV-3/DDP), and the role of p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA). METHODS: SKOV-3/DDP cells were randomly divided into control, DT, DPP and DPP+DT groups, which were treated with DT or combined DT and DDP. All cells were incubated for 48 h. and apoptosis rates were assessed by flow cytometry. mRNA and protein expression of PUMA, Bax and Bcl-2 was determined by RT-PCR and Western blot assays, respectively. RESULTS: Compared with control group, the apoptosis rates of SKOV-3/DDP cells in DT groups were obviously increased, with dose-dependence (P < 0.05), the mRNA and protein expressions of PUMA, Bax also being up-regulated (P < 0.05), while those of Bcl-2 were down-regulated (P < 0.05). Compared with DT groups, the apoptosis rate in the DDP+DT group was significantly increased (P < 0.05). After knockdown of PUMA with specific siRNA, the apoptosis rate of SKOV-3/DDP cells was obviously decreased (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: DT can promote the apoptosis of SKOV-3/DDP cells with PUMA playing a critical role.
