Helicobacter pylori infection alone or in combination with other factors is an important factor predisposing to dyspeptic disorders. Eradication of H. pylori fully eliminated dyspeptic syndrome or reduced its severity in the presence of concomitant factors. The efficacy of H. pylori eradication after first line therapy amounted to 85-90% based on the results of 13C-urease breath test, i.e. resistance to antibiotics did not exceed 10-15%. Repeated infection was very rare (2%).
