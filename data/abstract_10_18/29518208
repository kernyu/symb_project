Background: Enterococcus faecium is an important nosocomial pathogen. It has a high propensity for horizontal gene transfer, which has resulted in the emergence of MDR strains that are difficult to treat. The most notorious of these, vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, are usually treated with linezolid or daptomycin. Resistance has, however, been reported, meaning that new therapeutics are urgently needed. The 1,2,4-oxadiazoles are a recently discovered family of antimicrobials that are active against Gram-positive pathogens and therefore have therapeutic potential for treating E. faecium. However, only limited data are available on the activity of these antimicrobials against E. faecium. Objectives: To determine whether the 1,2,4-oxadiazole antimicrobials are active against MDR and daptomycin-non-susceptible E. faecium. Methods: The activity of the 1,2,4-oxadiazole antimicrobials against vancomycin-susceptible, vancomycin-resistant and daptomycin-non-susceptible E. faecium was determined using susceptibility testing, time-kill assays and synergy assays. Toxicity was also evaluated against human cells by XTT and haemolysis assays. Results: The 1,2,4-oxadiazoles are active against a range of MDR E. faecium, including isolates that display non-susceptibility to vancomycin and daptomycin. This class of antimicrobial displays rapid bactericidal activity and demonstrates superior killing of E. faecium compared with daptomycin. Finally, the 1,2,4-oxadiazoles act synergistically with daptomycin against E. faecium, with subinhibitory concentrations reducing the MIC of daptomycin for non-susceptible isolates to a level below the clinical breakpoint. Conclusions: The 1,2,4-oxadiazoles are active against MDR and daptomycin-non-susceptible E. faecium and hold great promise as future therapeutics for treating infections caused by these difficult-to-treat isolates.
