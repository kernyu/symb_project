Flagellin from the rice avirulent N1141 strain of Acidovorax avenae functions as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) and induces PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) in rice. To study the recognition mechanism of flagellin in rice, we attempted to define one or more regions of the flagellin protein required to activate the PTI response. Based on domain classification, we produced four fragments of N1141 flagellin: N-terminal D0, D1. and D2 domains (ND0-2), N-terminal D2, D3, and C-terminal D2 domains (ND2-CD2), C-terminal D2, D1, and D0 domains (CD2-0), and C-terminal D2 and D1 domains (CD2-1). The C-terminal CD2-1 and CD2-0 fragments induced PTI responses in cultured rice cells. Synthetic flg22, which is sufficient to produce the flagellin response in Arabidopsis, and the N-terminal flagellin fragments containing flg22 region elicited very weak immune responses in rice. OsFLS2, the rice ortholog of AtFLS2, which mediates flg22 recognition, was not involved in CD2-0 or CD2-1 recognition in rice. In addition, CD2-0 triggered resistance to coinfection with pathogenic bacteria. Taken together, these data suggest that rice mainly recognizes flagellin CD2-1 by a receptor distinct from OsFLS2 and that this epitope recognition leads to PTI responses.
