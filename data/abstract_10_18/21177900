Nocardia spp. can lead to local or disseminated infections, especially in immunocompromised patients. Combination therapy of amikacin and imipenem is commonly used to treat severe nocardial infections. We describe a patient with imipenem-resistant Nocardia cyriacigeorgica, which, to our knowledge, has not been previously reported among isolates of this species.
