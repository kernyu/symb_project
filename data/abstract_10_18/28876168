A plasmid pCY-CTX carrying a phage-like backbone from an extensively drug-resistant Enterobacter cloacae strain Guangzhou-ECL001 (previously known as CY01) was identified in this study. By Illumina MiSeq 2 x 250-bp paired-end sequencing, de novo assembly, and PCR, full sequence of pCY-CTX was obtained. Plasmid pCY-CTX was a circular plasmid with a length of 116,700 bp, harboring 136 putative open reading frames with the average G + C content of 50.8%. The backbone of pCY-CTX showed high identity to previously reported phage-like plasmid pHCM2 and phage SSU5. In addition, pCY-CTX contained a distinctive ISEcp1-mediated Tn2 region with two resistance genes blaTEM-1 and blaCTX-M-3. Transposition unit "ISEcp1- blaCTX-M-3- orf477" was inserted into the Tn2 structure, dividing Tn2 into two parts. This represents the first identification of a plasmid carrying a phage-like backbone and a distinctive ISEcp1-mediated Tn2 region within blaTEM-1 and blaCTX-M-3 in clinical E. cloacae. The finding of phage-like regions located in plasmids provides a new perspective in gene transfer associated with antimicrobial resistance.
