Antimicrobial resistance and the mechanisms implicated were studied in 119 enterococci from 105 meat samples from Tunisian markets. Almost 24.5% of recovered enterococci showed resistance against four or more antimicrobial agents and these isolates were identified to the species level. Enterococcus faecalis was the most prevalent species (41%). High percentages of erythromycin and tetracycline resistances were found among our isolates, and lower percentages were identified to aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and chloramphenicol. All tetracycline-resistant isolates carried the tet(M) and/or tet(L) genes. The erm(B) gene was detected in 78.5% of erythromycin-resistant isolates, ant(6)-Ia gene in 58.8% of streptomycin-resistant isolates, and cat(A) gene in one chloramphenicol-resistant isolate. Forty-eight isolates carried the gelE gene and exhibited gelatinase activity. The hyl and esp genes were detected in one and three Enterococcus faecium isolates, respectively. Streptomycin-resistant isolates showed a high genetic diversity by PFGE and MLST. Meat might play a role in the spread through the food chain of enterococci with these virulence and resistance characteristics to humans.
