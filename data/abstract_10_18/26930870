Traditional medicinal plants contain a wide variety of chemicals that have potent antibacterial activity. To find an alternative agent of overcoming the problems of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the antibacterial mechanism of Ponciruss trifoliata against MRSA was investigated. Ethyl acetate (EtOAc)-soluble extract of P. trifoliata methanolic extract was evaluated for antibacterial activity using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). An EtOAc sub-fraction 08 (EA08) from silica-gel open column chromatography exhibited strong anti-MRSA activity. Apart from the study to isolate single compound from EA08, a synergistic antibacterial effect between the sub-fraction and beta-lactam antibiotics against MRSA was determined. In order to elucidate the antibacterial restoring mechanism of EA08 on MRSA, mRNA expression of mecA gene and production penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a) encoded by mecA gene were monitored. EA 08 showed the strongest antibacterial activity with MIC value of 256 mug ml(-1). MIC of oxacillin against MRSA was dramatically reduced from 512 to 16 mug ml(-1) in combination with 256 mug ml(-1) of EA08. The fractional inhibitory concentration index of oxacillin was measured at 0.53 in combination with EA08 against MRSA, suggesting that EA08-oxacillin combinations exert synergetic effect against MRSA. The analysis of RT-PCR and Western blotting profiles revealed that EA08 inhibited mRNA expression of mecA gene and production PBP2a, which is a key determinant for beta-lactam antibiotic resistance, in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicated that EA08 eventually led to the reduction or inhibition of PBP2a production through translational inhibition in MRSA.
