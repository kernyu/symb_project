BACKGROUND: To explore the activity of pazopanib (P) + sirolimus (S) in patients who progressed after previous clinical benefit on pazopanib. METHODS: Eight patients with progressing metastatic high grade soft tissue sarcoma (STS) whose disease advanced on P following a response duration of at least 4 months were offered re-challenge of P supplemented by off-label S and a single patient with progressing metastatic chondrosarcoma was offered the combination as compassionate treatment. Patients were treated in two centers: Hadassah Medical Center and Tel Aviv Medical Center. Patients received oral P 200-600 mg once a day supplemented by S 3-4 mg taken separately, 12 h after the P dose. RESULTS: Patients received treatment from December 2012 to February 2016. Four progressed on the combination and their treatment was terminated. Two patients were undergoing treatment when data was summarized. Best Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumour (RECIST) responses were: one partial response (PR), four stable disease (SD), and four progressive disease (PD), corresponding to five PR and four PD on the Choi criteria. Median progression free survival was 5.5 months (range 4-17). CONCLUSIONS: Our series showed that the combination of P + S has activity in STS patients selected by previous response to P and in a patient with chondrosarcoma, suggesting this can serve as a mechanism to reverse resistance to P and extend the chemotherapy-free window.
