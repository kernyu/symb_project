Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) are causing an ongoing pandemic of mostly skin and soft tissue infections. The success of CA-MRSA as pathogens is due to a combination of antibiotic resistance with high virulence. In addition, it has been speculated that CA-MRSA strains such as the epidemic U.S. clone USA300 have increased capacity to colonize human epithelia, owing to bacteriocin-based bacterial interference. We here analyzed the molecular basis of antimicrobial activity detected in S. aureus strains, including those of the USA300 lineage. In contrast to a previous hypothesis, we found that this activity is not due to expression of a lantibiotic-type bacteriocin, but proteolytically processed derivatives of the phenol-soluble modulin (PSM) peptides PSMalpha1 and PSMalpha2. Notably, processed PSMalpha1 and PSMalpha2 exhibited considerable activity against Streptococcus pyogenes, indicating a role of PSMs in the interference of S. aureus strains with the competing colonizing pathogen. Furthermore, by offering a competitive advantage during colonization of the human body, the characteristically high production of PSMs in USA300 and other CA-MRSA strains may thus contribute not only to virulence but also the exceptional capacity of those strains to sustainably spread in the population, which so far has remained poorly understood.
