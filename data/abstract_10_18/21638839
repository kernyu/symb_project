The aim of the study was to assess the prescribing practices of fluoroquinolones (FQ) among general practionners in the town of Sousse (central-eastern Tunisia). A transversal study was made between the first and the 23rd April, 2009, among general practionners working in Sousse. For each prescription, informations about patients, indications and modalities of treatment were collected on a questionnaire. These prescriptions were compared to Tunisian and/or French guidelines for antibiotics use. One hundred and eighty eight FQ prescriptions were analyzed. The mean age of patients was 50 years. FQ were more often used alone (83%) and in first line intention (84%). The molecules used were essentially ciprofloxacin (44.7%), levofloxacin (35.6%) and ofloxacin (18.6%). The indications were mainly bronchopulmonary infections (34%) and urinary tract infection (32%). These choices were in accordance with guidelines in 41% of the prescriptions. The dosage was adapted, but the duration of treatment was often excessive. Further efforts are needed, to optimize the good use of FQ in order to reduce or stabilize the rate of bacterial resistance.
