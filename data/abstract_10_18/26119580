The aggregate of microorganisms residing on the surface of the skin, in the oropharynx and in the GI tract, known as the human microbiota, play a major role as natural reservoirs for bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Fluoroquinolones (FQ) are among the most prescribed antibiotics and a major increase in FQ resistance is occurring worldwide. High concentrations of FQ are found in microbial ecosystems explaining their profound effect on the clinically relevant bacteria that compose them. Yet, because of different local pharmacokinetics, distinct selective pressures occur in the different microbiota. Here we review the qualitative and quantitative impact of FQ on the three main human microbiota and their consequences, particularly in terms of emergence of antibiotic resistance. Finally, we review potential actions that could decrease the impact of FQs on microbiota.
