Infections with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) are common in critically ill patients and are challenging to manage appropriately. Strategies that can be used in the treatment of MDRO infections in the intensive care unit (ICU) include combination therapy, adjunctive aerosolized therapy, and optimization of pharmacokinetics with higher doses or extended-infusion therapy as appropriate. Rapid diagnostic tests could assist in improving timely appropriate antimicrobial therapy for MDRO infections in the ICU.
