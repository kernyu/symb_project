OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence and patterns of bacterial resistance in urine samples from a tertiary care oncology hospital in Mexico, from 2004 to 2013. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included the strains obtained from urine cultures, describing separately multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. We analyzed the susceptibility to different antibiotics. RESULTS: 51 202 urine cultures were processed during the study; 14 480 (28.3%) cultures were positive. In 11 427 samples Gram negative (79%) were isolated, 2 080 Gram positive (14.4%), and 973 yeasts (6.6%). Escherichia coli was the most frequent bacteria identified (56.1%); 24% of the community strains and 65.7% of the nosocomial were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers (ESBL). Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated in 705 samples (4.8%); 115 were ESBL (16%), 13.1% from community and 29.8% from nosocomial source. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was identified in 593 cultures (4.1%): 9% from community and 51% nosocomial. CONCLUSIONS: MDR bacteria were more frequent in nosocomial isolates. It should be a priority to intensify the rational use of antimicrobials in the community and antibiotic stewardship in the hospital.
