The level of an antibiotic capable of inhibiting the etiological agent at the site of infection is an essential prerequisite for successful antibiotic therapy. In some cases, locally applied antibiotics may compensate for limitations of systemic administration and shorten systemic therapy. We aimed at verifying to what extent vancomycin (Van) bound to ground bone grafts is usable in the treatment of serious infections. The levels of released Van significantly exceeded the Van minimum inhibitory concentration, which can suppress Van-sensitive staphylococci and Van intermediate Staphylococcus aureus, for the whole period of a 16-day measurement. Our results indicate that bone grafts can be used as Van carriers in therapy of osteomyelitis caused by Van-sensitive Staphylococcus strains.
