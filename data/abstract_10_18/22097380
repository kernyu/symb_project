On the basis of resistance breeding and selection in laboratory, and by using the threshold trait analysis in quantitative genetics, this paper studied the realized resistance heritability of Panonychus citri (McGregor) collected from Beibei of Chongqing to avermectin and fenpropathrin, and predicted the resistance risk of P. citri to these two acaricides. After 11- and 16-generations of selection with avermectin and fenpropathrin, the resistance of P. citri to the two acaricides increased by 3.8- and 29.9-fold, and the realized resistance heritability was 0.0475 and 0.1544, respectively. Under laboratory condition, to develop a 10-fold increase of resistance required 12-26 generations of selection for avermectin, and 7-16 generations of selection for fenpropathrin under the selection pressure of 50%-90% mortality for each generation. Under field condition, it would require more generations to develop the same resistance level. Comparing with bioacaricide avermectin, pyrethroid fenpropathrin had obviously higher resistance risk to P. citri. The results provided references for the resistance management of P. citri to acaricides.
