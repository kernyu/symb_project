Tuberculosis patients may harbor both drug-susceptible and -resistant bacteria, i.e., heteroresistance. We used mixtures of rifampin-resistant and -susceptible Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains to simulate heteroresistance in patient samples. Molecular tests can be used for earlier discovery of multidrug resistance (MDR), but the sensitivity to detect heteroresistance is unknown. Conventional phenotypic drug susceptibility testing was the most sensitive, whereas two line probe assays and sequencing were unable to detect the clinically important 1% resistant bacteria.
