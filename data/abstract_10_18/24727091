Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-dependent IL-12 secretion by dendritic cells is critical for natural killer cell-mediated IFN-gamma production and innate resistance to Toxoplasma gondii. Although MyD88(-/-) mice challenged with T. gondii have defective IL-12 responses and succumb to infection, administration of IL-12 to MyD88(-/-) mice fails to prevent acute mortality, suggesting that MyD88 may mediate signals within natural killer cells important for IL-12-dependent IFN-gamma production and innate resistance to this parasite. In this study, we found that T. gondii antigens and IL-12 could synergistically trigger IFN-gamma secretion by natural killer cells, which was dependent on toll-like receptor-MyD88 signaling. Further analysis showed that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase and NF-kappaB multiple pathways downstream of MyD88 contributed to IFN-gamma production by natural killer cells. Moreover, the well-established toll-like receptor agonists, T. gondii profilin (Tgprofilin) and T. gondii heat shock protein 70 (TgHSP70) could evoke a similar IFN-gamma secretory response in natural killer cells to that evoked by T. gondii antigens. In vivo adoptive transfer experiments showed that, upon challenge with T. gondii, NOD/SCID-beta2 microglobulin null (NOD/SCID-beta2m(-/-)) mice injected i.v. with MyD88(-/-) natural killer cells had reduced serum IFN-gamma levels and increased splenic tachyzoite burdens compared with those injected i.v. with wild-type natural killer cells. Taken together, these findings demonstrate a critical role for natural killer cell intrinsic toll-like receptor-MyD88 signaling in IL-12-dependent early IFN-gamma production and innate resistance to T. gondii.
