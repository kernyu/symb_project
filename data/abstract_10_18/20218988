Although neuraminidase inhibitors are active against most 2009-2010 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) swine-origin strains, sporadic cases of oseltamivir resistance have been described. Since April 2009, 54 cases of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 swine-origin have been reported in the USA (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/; accessed 1 February 2010). Approximately 1.4% of tested isolates are oseltamivir resistant. We report a patient with an underlying hematological malignancy who was hospitalized with influenza A (H1N1) swine-origin and whose strain developed oseltamivir resistance during therapy.
