Malaria, despite being one of the world's oldest infectious diseases, remains difficult to eradicate because the parasite is rapidly developing resistance to frontline chemotherapies. Previous studies have shown that the parasite exhibits features resembling programmed cell death upon treatment with drugs that disrupt its digestive vacuole (DV), providing a phenotypic readout that can be detected using the imaging flow cytometer. Large compound collections can thus be screened to identify drugs that are able to disrupt the DV of the malaria parasite using this high-content high-throughput screening platform. As a proof-of-concept, 4440 compounds were screened using this platform in 4months and 254 hits (5.7% hit rate) were obtained. Additionally, 25 compounds (0.6% top hit rate) were observed to retain potent DV disruption activity that was comparable to the canonical DV disruptive drug chloroquine when tested at a ten-fold lower concentration from the original screen. This pilot study demonstrates the robustness and high-throughput capability of the imaging flow cytometer and we report herein the methodology of this screening assay.
