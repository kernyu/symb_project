Isolation and characterization of metabolites produced by endophytes are significant ways to search for novel natural active substances, proving that the endophytes are the unique resources of newer and more effective compounds. Many new compounds with antimicrobial activity from different endophytes have been isolated so far. These new compounds provide alternatives to fight against multi-drug resistance of microorganisms. This review outlined the major achievements and latest developments of endophytes, including the diversity of endophytes and antimicrobial activity of endophytes, as well as its development in China.
