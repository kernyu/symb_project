Cryptosporidiosis is a common gastro-intestinal illness in animals and man worldwide. The disease is devastating in immune-suppressed individuals but self-limiting in competent hosts. The infectious stages of the organism (oocysts) are shed in the faeces of affected individuals, survive in adverse environmental conditions and spread by direct contact or through contaminants (food, water). Due to the robustness of the oocysts, their tenacity, tiny size, and resistance to common disinfectants, the parasite is difficult to eradicate from contaminated environments. To obtain sufficient control both treatment of infected hosts and inactivation of oocysts are necessary. Several drugs are commonly used to treat cryptosporidiosis in man and very few in animals but none of them are completely effective in terms of both clinical and parasitological response. Only a few chemical agents are able to inactivate oocysts in the environment including water treatment plants but their application has certain limitations. Therefore, control of cryptosporidiosis remains a global challenge in both veterinary and human medicine. Extensive research has been performed on suitable drugs and disinfectants. Thousands of agents have been tested both in vivo and in vitro. Some are excitingly active in vitro but exhibit poor or no response in clinical trials. Currently, no single or combined drug therapy has proven to be completely effective against this disease. This article will focus on therapy and prevention of cryptosporidiosis in animals including perspectives for new drugs.
