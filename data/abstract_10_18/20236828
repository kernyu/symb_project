An efficient synthesis of 29 new binaphthyl-based neutral, and mono- and di-cationic, peptoids is described. Some of these compounds had antibacterial activities with MIC values of 1.9-3.9microg/mL against Staphylococcus aureus. One peptoid had a MIC value of 6microg/mL against a methicillin-resistant strain of S. aureus (MRSA) and a MIC value of 2microg/mL against vancomycin-resistant strains of enterococci (VRE).
