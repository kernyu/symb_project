BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Gram-negative bacilli are the causative organisms for a significant proportion of patients with severe community acquired pneumonia (CAP) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Clinical guidelines recommend broad spectrum antimicrobials for empiric treatment despite alarming global trends in antimicrobial resistance. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of gentamicin, an aminoglycoside with potent bactericidal activity, for empiric Gram-negative cover of severe CAP admitted to ICU. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study at a university teaching hospital where the severe CAP guideline recommends penicillin, azithromycin and gentamicin as empiric cover. Ceftriaxone plus azithromycin is used as an alternative. We included adults with radiologically-confirmed severe community-acquired pneumonia, comparing those who received gentamicin in the first 72 hours of admission with those who did not. Participants were identified using ICD-10 codes for bacterial pneumonia and data manually extracted from electronic medical records. RESULTS: 117 of 148 patients admitted with severe pneumonia were given at least one dose of gentamicin while the remaining 31 were not. The two groups were well matched in terms of demographics, comorbidities and disease severity. There was no significant difference in the incidence of acute kidney injury (59/117 [51%] versus 16/31 [52%] in the gentamicin and no gentamicin groups respectively), hospital mortality (20/117 [17%] versus 7/31 [23%]) and secondary outcomes including relapse and length of hospital stay. CONCLUSION: Gentamicin is safe and has similar outcomes to alternative Gram-negative antimicrobial regimens for empiric cover in severe CAP admitted to ICU.
