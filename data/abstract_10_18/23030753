Multidrug resistant tuberculosis has been a challenging situation in the clinical practice with respect to appropriate clinical treatment and management of the disease. The likelihood of resistance development is known to be lower in lesions with lesser percentages of the bacterial population. The present paper was designed to present a rare case of pulmonary multidrug resistant tuberculosis with extrapulmonary involvement to emphasize the consideration of genital tuberculosis with possible infertility in patients admitting with a scrotal mass.
