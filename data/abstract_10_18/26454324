We compared levofloxacin (1 mug/disk) disk diffusion method to E test against 212 Helicobacter pylori strains. Using diameter breakpoints for susceptibility (>/=15 mm) and resistance (</=9 mm), very major error, major error rate, and categoric agreement were 0.0%, 0.6%, and 93.9%, respectively. The method may be useful in low-resource laboratories.
