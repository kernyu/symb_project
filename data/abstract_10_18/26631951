Azole resistant Aspergillus fumigatus strains are increasingly reported in many countries. One resistance mechanism is attributed to the use of azole fungicides in environment. Two mutations, TR34/L98H and TR46/Y121F/T289A, on the cyp51A gene, have been described. Results of 40 publications about azole resistant strain detections, with TR34/L98H and TR46/Y121F/T289A mutations, in clinical and/or environmental samples, are presented in this review. These cases, observed in many countries, suggest spreading phenomenon. Measures to moderate fungicides treatments and/or alternative treatments in environment should be established to preserve the effectiveness of azole antifungal therapy for at-risk patients.
