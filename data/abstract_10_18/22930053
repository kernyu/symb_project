The occurrence of tuberculosis with first-line multidrug resistance leads to the use of alternative medications, often at higher costs, longer treatment periods, and greater clinical complexity. Here, we report 3 patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. One patient with human immunodeficiency virus died before the sensitivity test was performed. The early diagnosis of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and appropriate treatment should be priorities of the National Tuberculosis Control Program in order to break the chain of transmission. In addition, the possibility of substituting the proportion method with more modern and faster techniques should be urgently evaluated.
