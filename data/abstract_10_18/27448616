The study of chemical composition and biological activity of unexplored essential oils may open new perspectives on their potential use in facing major health concerns such as drug-resistant infections. The present study investigates the chemical composition and antimicrobial effects of previously unstudied essential oils obtained from genus Eryngium: Eryngium glomeratum Lam. and Eryngium barrelieri Boiss. The chemical compositions of the essential oils from aerial parts and roots of both species were studied using GC and GC/MS analytical technics. The analysis led to the identification of 102 compounds totalizing 85 - 94% of all detected compounds. Essential oils were characterized by the predominance of oxygenated sesquiterpenes. The oils obtained from aerial parts were tested against 36 microbial strains by agar dilution method and showed minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) in the range of 2 - 625 mug/ml. A strong antibacterial activity against multiresistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa was observed especially from E. glomeratum essential oil with MIC value up to 2 mug/ml. These findings give significant information about the pharmacological activity of these essential oils, which suggest their potential use to develop new remedies, or as sources of active compounds.
