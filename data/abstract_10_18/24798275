New drugs and drugs with a novel mechanism of action are desperately needed to shorten the duration of tuberculosis treatment, to prevent the emergence of drug resistance, and to treat multiple-drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Recently, there has been renewed interest in clofazimine (CFZ). In this study, we utilized the C3HeB/FeJ mouse model, possessing highly organized, hypoxic pulmonary granulomas with caseous necrosis, to evaluate CFZ monotherapy in comparison to results with BALB/c mice, which form only multifocal, coalescing cellular aggregates devoid of caseous necrosis. While CFZ treatment was highly effective in BALB/c mice, its activity was attenuated in the lungs of C3HeB/FeJ mice. This lack of efficacy was directly related to the pathological progression of disease in these mice, since administration of CFZ prior to the formation of hypoxic, necrotic granulomas reconstituted bactericidal activity in this mouse strain. These results support the continued use of mouse models of tuberculosis infection which exhibit a granulomatous response in the lungs that more closely resembles the pathology found in human disease.
