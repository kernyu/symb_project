The review presents principles of pathogenetic therapy in tuberculosis and current trends in pharmacotherapy: immunocorrection, prophylaxis, chemotherapy side effects management. Immunocorrection is illustrated by treatment with drugs of a polyvalent action - glutoxim and cyclopheron. Mechanisms of their immune action are outlined. As to hepatoprotection, remaxol is an effective hepatoprotecting medicine improving energy supply to hepatocytes and their membranes resistance to lipid peroxidation, reactivating enzymes of antioxidant defense. Remaxol has an antioxidant/antihypoxic action, is the most promosing metabolic corrector with hepatoprotective activity.
