Candida albicans, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis are able to form biofilms on virtually any biomaterial implanted in a human host. Biofilms are a primary cause of mortality in immunocompromised and hospitalized patients, as they cause recurrent and invasive candidiasis, which is difficult to eradicate. This is due to the fact that the biofilm cells show high resistance to antifungal treatments and the host defense mechanisms, and exhibit an excellent ability to adhere to biomaterials. Elucidation of the mechanisms of antifungal resistance in Candida biofilms is of unquestionable importance; therefore, this review analyzes both the chemical composition of biomaterials used to fabricate the medical devices, as well as the Candida genes and proteins that confer drug resistance.
