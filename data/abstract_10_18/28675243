Acute respiratory infections place a huge burden on society in terms of disability, premature mortality, and also direct health service costs (drugs prescriptions) and the indirect costs related to lost production. Therefore, prevention of respiratory infections is an important goal for public health interventions. In this context, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) represent an interesting perspective for research and development by virtue of their favorable antimicrobial activity against many respiratory pathogens. One of the latest innovations in the biotech field discussed in this review is the creation of a biocompatible, biogel-based nasal filter enriched with AgNPs. Compared to traditional personal protective equipment (PPE), this type of nasal filter has the advantage of combining the antibacterial and antiviral activity of AgNPs with the common filtration capacity shared by other PPEs. This dual mechanism means that AgNP-enriched nasal filters serve to reduce the infecting microbial-load and protect the lower airways, without interfering with the normal respiratory capacity (airflow-resistance <5%). Given their antimicrobial characteristics and performance, AgNP-enriched nasal filters can meet many community and occupational currently unmet needs in the prevention of airborne infectious diseases, by ensuring an excellent respiratory-comfort and a continuous day-use.
