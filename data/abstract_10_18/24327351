An antibacterial platform based on multifunctional reduced graphene oxide (rGO) that is responsive to near-infrared (NIR) light has been constructed. By introducing a luminescent Eu(3+) complex and vancomycin for bacteria tracking into one system, this platform could specifically recognize and light up bacteria. Antibacterial activity of this nanoscale construction under NIR illumination was investigated. Upon illumination with NIR light, this nanoscale architecture generates great heat locally, resulting in the death of drug-resistant bacteria. These results indicate that the ability of this nanoscale platform to kill drug-resistant bacteria has great potential for clinical pathogenic bacteria diagnosis and treatment.
