OBJECTIVE: To determine the in vitro activity of Fosfomycin tromethamine against extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing uropathogens. STUDY DESIGN: Experimental study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Microbiology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi, from October 2011 to October 2012. METHODOLOGY: A total of 381 culture positive ESBL producing isolates from 2400 urine samples submitted over a period of one year were included in this study. Identification of isolates was done by standard biochemical profile of the organisms. The antimicrobial susceptibility of culture positive isolates was performed by disk diffusion method as recommended by Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute guidelines (CLSI). RESULTS: The antimicrobial activity of Fosfomycin to various isolates revealed that 93% of E. coli, 64% Klebsiella spp. 50% Proteus spp. 75% Enterobacter cloacae, 100% Citrobacter freundii, 100% Burkholderia spp. 100% Serratia spp. and 50% Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were susceptible to this chemical compound. CONCLUSION: Fosfomycin showed excellent effectiveness to most of the common ESBL producing bacteria such as E. coli, Klebsiella and Proteus spp.
