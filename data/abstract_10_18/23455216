The aim of this study is to evaluate the susceptibility and resistance pattern of clinical isolates causing different types of infections and to compare the efficacy of antibiotics namely levofloxacin and cefepime. The in-vitro antibacterial activity and resistance patterns of these two well known antibiotics were studied and compared using disk diffusion method. For this, one hundred clinical isolates comprising of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were collected from different local pathological laboratories and hospitals. Escherichia coli (17.95% against cefepime and 30.77% against levofloxacin), Staphylococcus aureus (30% against cefepime and 46.66% against levofloxacin) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (23.53% against cefepime and 35.29% against levofloxacin) were found resistant against the studied antibiotics which show that cefepime is more effective than levofloxacin. In case of Klebsiella pneumoniae, resistance was 42.85% against cefepime and 35.71% against levofloxacin thereby showing that levofloxacin is more effective than cefepime. Concluded that the clinical isolates collected were susceptible to both the antibiotics but the microbial resistance against these antibiotics is increasing in our population which is alarming. Therefore, it is recommended the physicians may prescribe these antibiotics unless no other substitute is available in clinical practice.
