The rapid emergence of novel multidrug-resistant organisms coupled with the slow development of new antibiotics is of great concern. With the discovery of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (NDM-1)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, clinicians are faced with problems in the treatment of infections caused by this multidrug-resistant organism. Therapeutic experiences are limited. We share our experience of the successful treatment of a febrile neutropenic patient with NDM-1-producing K. pneumoniae bacteraemia.
