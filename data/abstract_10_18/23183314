China's tuberculosis (TB) burden is second only to that of India worldwide. In Chongqing, the largest municipality in southwestern China, although the prevalence of both TB and drug-resistant TB is higher than in other municipalities, the molecular characteristics and drug susceptibility phenotypes are poorly known. In this study, 297 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from Chongqing were genotyped with spacer oligonucleotide typing (spoligotyping) and 28-locus MIRU-VNTR (24-locus MIRU-VNTR scheme and 4 other loci). Spoligotyping results were compared with drug-resistant profiles. Patients who showed clustering by both spoligotyping and 28-locus MIRU-VNTR were interviewed to investigate their detailed contact history. Our data demonstrated that the Beijing genotype was the most prevalent genotype, and ST1 was the most predominant lineage in Chongqing. The Beijing genotype was significantly associated with ethambutol resistance and multidrug-resistant phenotypes. A combination of the 10 most polymorphic loci permitted to achieve higher discriminatory power than 24-VNTR. In addition, a presumed transmission pathway was observed in a cluster of patients with the same MIRU-VNTR profile. The 10-VNTR locus set is suitable for genotyping of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Chongqing.
