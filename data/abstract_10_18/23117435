Leishmaniasis is a neglected disease responsible for about 56,000 deaths every year. Despite its importance, there are no effective, safe and proper treatments for leishmaniasis due to strain resistance and/or drug side-effects. In this work we report the synthesis, molecular modeling, cytotoxicity and the antileishmanial profile of a series of 4-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)benzenesulfonamides. Our experimental data showed an active profile for some compounds against Leishmania infantum and Leishmania amazonensis. The profile of two compounds against L. infantum was similar to that of pentamidine, but with lower cytotoxicity. Molecular modeling evaluation indicated that changes in electronic regions, orientation as well as lipophilicity of the derivatives were areas to improve the interaction with the parasitic target. Overall the compounds represent feasible prototypes for designing new molecules against L. infantum and L. amazonensis.
