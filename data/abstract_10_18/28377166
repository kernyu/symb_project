Telavancin was tested against a worldwide collection of Gram-positive pathogens (967) isolated from bone and joint infections (BJI). Most BJI isolates were from the United States (US) (49.9%) followed by Europe (26.4%), Latin America (LATAM; 14.4%), and Asia-Pacific (APAC; 9.3%). Organisms were tested by broth microdilution susceptibility methods. S. aureus (66.4%; range of 48.9% in APAC to 71.2% in LATAM) was the most common pathogen and had a 35.7% methicillin resistance (MRSA) rate and telavancin MIC50/90 of 0.03/0.06mug/mL (100% susceptible). MRSA isolates that were daptomycin resistant (0.2%) were telavancin susceptible. CoNS (12.1% of BJI) had telavancin MIC50/90 at 0.06/0.06mug/mL, and 13.7% were teicoplanin resistant. Enterococci had telavancin MIC50/90 at 0.12/0.25mug/mL, but telavancin inhibited vancomycin-susceptible isolates at </=0.25mug/mL. All streptococci were telavancin susceptible (MIC90, 0.03-0.06mug/mL). The in vitro results presented here warrant further investigations to access the role of telavancin for BJI/osteomyelitis treatment caused by Gram-positive cocci.
