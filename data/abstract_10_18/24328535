Although human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection causes serious health problems in Indonesia, information in regard to drug resistance is limited. We performed a genotypic study on HIV-1 integrase derived from drug-naive individuals in Surabaya, Indonesia. Sequencing analysis revealed that no primary mutations associated with drug resistance to integrase inhibitors were detected; however, secondary mutations, V72I, L74I/M, V165I, V201I, I203M, and S230N, were detected in more than 5% of samples. In addition, V201I was conserved among all samples. Most integrase genes were classified into CRF01_AE genes. Interestingly, 40% of the CRF01_AE genes had an unusual insertion in the C-terminus of integrase. These mutations and insertions were considered natural polymorphisms since these mutations coincided with previous reports, and integrase inhibitors have not been used in Indonesia. Our results indicated that further studies may be required to assess the impact of these mutations on integrase inhibitors prior to their introduction into Indonesia.
