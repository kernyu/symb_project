After the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, the incidence of pneumococcal infections due to meropenem-resistant serotype 15A-ST63 strains increased in Japan. By using whole-genome sequencing and comparing sequences with those of clones from the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, we clarified the traits of the serotype 15A-ST63 clone. Our analysis revealed that the meropenem-resistant serotype 15A-ST63 strains from Japan originated from meropenem-susceptible strains from Japan. Recombination site prediction analysis showed that the meropenem-resistant strain-specific recombination regions included the pbp1a and pbp2b regions. A detailed analysis of the composition of these genes indicated that resistance seems to be caused by pbp1a recombination. The pbp1a gene in meropenem-resistant isolates was identical to that in multidrug (including meropenem)-resistant serotype 19A-ST320 pneumococci, which have spread in the United States. The global spread of pneumococci of this lineage is noteworthy because serotype 15A is not included in the currently used 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.
