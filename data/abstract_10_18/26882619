Causative factors of multi-drug resistance tuberculosis (MDR-TB) were analyzed from iatrogenic angles, patients themselves, and society. Reviewed was the development of treatment strategies for MDR-TB from directly observed treatment short-course (DOTS) to DOTS-Plus. The history of Chinese medicine (CM) fighting TB and characteristics at the present stage were also analyzed. Authors pointed out that CM pays attention not only to killing pathogens and confirms the necessity of getting rid of pathogens, but also to cascade response caused by pathogens. It also regards the occurrence and development of MDR-TB as a whole by combining patients' conditions, climatic, geographic, psychological, and social factors. Authors believed that therapeutic principles under guidance of CM holistic view are of positive significance and inspiration in treating MDR-TB, and emphasized holistic view as basic strategies for treating MDR-TB, but not a single countermeasure.
