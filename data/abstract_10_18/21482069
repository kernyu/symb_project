OBJECTIVE: The omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids can suppress immune system functions. This property may cause adverse effects by impairing host resistance to infection. The present study focused on estimating the impact of different dietary lipids on the immune system of mice after a secondary infection with Listeria monocytogenes. METHODS: BALB/c mice were divided into five dietary groups of olive oil, fish oil, sunflower oil, high-oleic sunflower oil, or low fat that was administered for 8 wk. The mice were immunized with 10(3) colony-forming units. Thirty-eight days later, each mouse was challenged with 10(4) colony-forming units. Mice survival and bacterial clearance from livers and spleens were determined. In addition, cytokine, chemokine, and adhesion molecule productions were quantified from the sera. RESULTS: Survival percentage in mice fed a fish oil diet was 100% and bacterial numbers from spleen were decreased at 72 h. Interleukin-12, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 productions were decreased. Levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma were increased, whereas macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha) production was unaltered. CONCLUSION: Immune defense in mice fed a fish oil diet was improved after secondary exposure, acquiring an adequate resistance. This result could be attributable to an increase of a T-helper type 1 response.
