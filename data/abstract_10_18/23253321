Chronic infection of the airways with Pseudomonas aeruginosa represents a therapeutic challenge. Currently existing approaches are particularly based on systemic approaches and this increases the risk of strain resistance selection and is frequently associated with side effects. Therefore, local delivery of antibiotics may reduce these risks and may provide sustained sterilization of the respiratory tract. In fact, this approach was found to be effective with inhaled tobramycin in cystic fibrosis. Inhaled ciprofloxacin (dry powder inhaled formulation or liposomal inhaled formulation) is currently being investigated in chronic infections of the airways in cystic fibrosis, non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and the initial clinical data are encouraging. This paper presents a perspective on the potential role of inhaled ciprofloxacin in such infections.
