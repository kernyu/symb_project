BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBLs) production is still the most frequent mechanism of resistance to cephalosporins in gram-negative bacteria. The aim of the study was to identify the types of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates causing nosocomial infections in Mexico. METHODS: ESBL production was performed using a disk diffusion method. The MIC for several antibiotics was performed by agar dilution on Mueller-Hinton. PFGE typing was carried out on all enterobacteria assayed. The beta-lactamase pattern was obtained by IEF and bioassay. Genes of beta-lactamases were amplified by PCR with specific primers and products were sequenced and analyzed using informatics programs. Plasmid isolation and conjugation experiments were carried out using standard methodologies. RESULTS: There were 134 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae included from a retrospective and multicenter study that included eight Mexican hospitals from 1999 to 2005. The most prevalent species were K. pneumoniae (56%), Enterobacter cloacae (29%), and Escherichia coli (15%). Molecular analysis identified the underlying endemic and polyclonal spread of enterobacterials in each hospital. The most frequent ESBLs identified were SHV-type (84%), TLA-1 (11%), and CTX-M-15 (5%). Successful matings were detected in 68.4% (71/104) isolates. CONCLUSIONS: ESBL-producer K. pneumoniae remains the most frequent bacterial species obtained in nosocomial infections. The SHV-type and TLA-1 ESBLs were disseminated in most hospitals analyzed and CTX-M-15 was emerging in one of the studied hospitals. This work highlights the proper use of antibiotics to avoid the selection of these types of multiresistant bacteria.
