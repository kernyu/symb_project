The rise in multidrug-resistant (MDR) infections has become a significant problem in both the developing countries and in the United States (U.S.). Specifically, MDR gram-negative infections are emerging, affecting not only adults but children as well. The specific gram-negative organisms that have been most concerning within the pediatric population include MDR P. aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae, and Acinetobacter spp. The increase in antimicrobial resistance rates are associated with various mechanisms, with, one of the most common being the production of beta-lactamases. Both ceftazidime/avibactam (CZA) and ceftolozane/tazobactam (C/T) are two recently approved antibiotics in the U.S. While both of these agents are inhibitors of beta-lactamase enzymes, there are differences between them that are important to understand. At this time the data in children for these agents are extremely limited.. The aim of this review is to describe the characteristics of these agents and their potential uses in pediatric patients.
