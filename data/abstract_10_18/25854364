In molecular-targeted cancer therapy, acquired resistance to gemcitabine is a major clinical problem that reduces its effectiveness, resulting in recurrence and metastasis of cancers. In spite of great efforts to reveal the overall mechanism of acquired gemcitabine resistance, no definitive genetic factors have been identified that are absolutely responsible for the resistance process. Therefore, we performed a cross-platform meta-analysis of three publically available microarray datasets for cancer cell lines with acquired gemcitabine resistance, using the R-based RankProd algorithm, and were able to identify a total of 158 differentially expressed genes (DEGs; 76 up- and 82 down-regulated) that are potentially involved in acquired resistance to gemcitabine. Indeed, the top 20 up- and down-regulated DEGs are largely associated with a common process of carcinogenesis in many cells. For the top 50 up- and down-regulated DEGs, we conducted integrated analyses of a gene regulatory network, a gene co-expression network, and a protein-protein interaction network. The identified DEGs were functionally enriched via Gene Ontology hierarchy and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses. By systemic combinational analysis of the three molecular networks, we could condense the total number of DEGs to final seven genes. Notably, GJA1, LEF1, and CCND2 were contained within the lists of the top 20 up- or down-regulated DEGs. Our study represents a comprehensive overview of the gene expression patterns associated with acquired gemcitabine resistance and theoretical support for further clinical therapeutic studies.
