Persisters are specialized survivor cells that protect bacterial populations from killing by antibiotics. Persisters are dormant phenotypic variants of regular cells rather than mutants. Bactericidal antibiotics kill by corrupting their targets into producing toxic products; tolerance to antibiotics follows when targets are inactive. Transcriptome analysis of isolated persisters points to toxin/antitoxin modules as a principle component of persister formation. Mechanisms of persister formation are redundant, making it difficult to eradicate these cells. In Escherichia coli, toxins RelE and MazF cause dormancy by degrading mRNA; HipA inhibits translation by phosphorylating Ef-Tu; and TisB forms an anion channel in the membrane, leading to a decrease in pmf and ATP levels. Prolonged treatment of chronic infections with antibiotics selects for hip mutants that produce more persister cells. Eradication of tolerant persisters is a serious challenge. Some of the existing antibiotics are capable of killing persisters, pointing to ways of developing therapeutics to treat chronic infections. Mitomycin is a prodrug which is converted into a reactive compound forming adducts with DNA upon entering the cell. Prolonged treatment with aminoglycosides that cause mistranslation leading to misfolded peptides can sterilize a stationary culture of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a pathogen responsible for chronic, highly tolerant infections of cystic fibrosis patients. Finally, one of the best bactericidal agents is rifampin, an inhibitor of RNA polymerase, and we suggest that it "kills" by preventing persister resuscitation.
