OBJECTIVE: To investigate current situation of pan-drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii in hospital and its drug-resistance , then provide reference for rational use of antibiotics in clinic. METHODS: All kinds of microbial test specimens from January 2009 to December 2012 of hospitalized patients were cultured and separated. VITEK 2-Compact fully automatic microorganism analyzer was used to identify and analyze drug sensitivity. RESULTS: Three hundred and seven strains pan-drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii were isolated in 4 years, the primarily source were sputum, accounted for 69.4%, followed by the wound secretion 14.7%. The highest three places of samples separation of extensive drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii positive was intensive care unit (ICU, accounted for 26.4%), department of respiratory medicine (accounted for 26.1%) and department of geriatrics (accounted for 23.1%). Extensive drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii almost completely resisted to clinical commonly used antimicrobial agents, drug resistant rate could be as high as 100% such as cefotaxime, meropenem, piperacillin, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, and tetracycline except for cefoperazone-sulbactam and polymyxin, and the rate of other drugs were all above 90%. Drug-resistant of cefoperazone-sulbactam was nearly 30% in our hospital, and sensitive rate was 100% to polymyxin. CONCLUSIONS: Pan-drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii is resistant for most clinical commonly used antimicrobial drug, antimicrobial agents were chosen according to drug susceptibility testing. Antibacterial drugs such as polymyxin and cefoperazone-sulbactam or sulbactam contained drugs can be selected for pan-drug-resistant.
