The treatment of chronic hepatitis C and B has become more and more complex over the last years. Individualisation of therapy, depending of the natural history as well as on treatment response, is increasingly finding its way into clinical practice. In addition, a significant number of new molecules active, against the hepatitis C virus, are currently in clinical evaluation. The goal of this review is to provide an up-to-date overview on the current treatment options for patients with a chronic viral hepatitis.
