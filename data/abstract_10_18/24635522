The production of beta-lactamase is one of the primary resistance mechanisms used by Gram-negative bacterial pathogens to counter beta-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems. There is an urgent need to develop novel beta-lactamase inhibitors in response to ever evolving beta-lactamases possessing an expanded spectrum of beta-lactam hydrolyzing activity. Whereas traditional high-throughput screening has proven ineffective against serine beta-lactamases, fragment-based approaches have been successfully employed to identify novel chemical matter, which in turn has revealed much about the specific molecular interactions possible in the active site of serine and metallo beta-lactamases. In this review, we summarize recent progress in the field, particularly: the identification of novel inhibitor chemotypes through fragment-based screening; the use of fragment-protein structures to understand key features of binding hot spots and inform the design of improved leads; lessons learned and new prospects for beta-lactamase inhibitor development using fragment-based approaches.
