OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of S. pneumoniae serotype 19A (Spn19A), before and after the introduction of heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) in Mexico. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Descriptive study carried out in Mexico with surveillance information of pneumococcal disease, generated from the Sireva network. We performed lineal regression analysis with the proportion of Spn19A by year in two study periods. Data were analyzed using SPSS v.18 software. RESULTS: A total of 1825 S. pneumoniae strains causing infection in pediatric population were recovered in the period 2000-2012, 225/12.3% were Spn19A, and of these, 75/6.3% were isolated in 2000-2008 and 150/23.6% in 2009-2012. There was an increase in antimicrobial resistance post-vaccination for all drugs except vancomycin. CONCLUSION: It was observed that the frequency of this serotype and antimicrobial resistance increased after the introduction of PCV7.
