Macrolide antibiotics are widely prescribed for the treatment of respiratory tract infections; however, the increasing prevalence of macrolide-resistant pathogens is a public health concern. Therefore, the development of new macrolide scaffolds with activities against resistant pathogens is urgently needed. An efficient method for reconstructing the erythromycin A macrolactone skeleton has been established. Based on this methodology, novel 15-membered macrolides, known as '11a-azalides', with substituents at the C12, C13, or C4'' positions were synthesized and their antibacterial activities were evaluated. These derivatives showed promising antibacterial activities against erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Among them, the C4'' substituted derivatives had the most potent activity against erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae.
