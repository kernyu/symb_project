Telavancin is approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP) and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus. This study provides a current in vitro activity analysis for telavancin and comparators against 1353 United States S. aureus causing pneumonia in hospitalized patients during 2013-2014. Telavancin was found to exhibit potent activity (MIC90, 0.06mug/mL; 16-fold more active than vancomycin or linezolid) against all S. aureus isolates, including the HABP subset, multidrug-resistant isolates, and those less susceptible to vancomycin.
