Viruses were sequenced from 75 antiretroviral therapy (ARV)-naive and from 75 ARV-treated patients who subsequently received a raltegravir-containing regimen. No major integrase inhibitor (INI)-resistance mutations were present in the 150 integrase (IN) sequences. Four ARV-naive (5.3%) and two ARV-treated patients (2.7%) had one of the following minor INI-resistance mutations: L74M, E157Q, G163R, and R263K but there was no association between baseline raltegravir genotype and subsequent response to raltegravir treatment. We also combined our sequences with 4170 previously published group M IN sequences from INI-naive patients to assess IN sequence variability and compared our findings with those of a study we performed in 2008 using data from 1563 patients. The number of polymorphic IN positions increased from 40% to 41% between the two studies. However, none of the major INI-resistance mutations was found to be polymorphic in either study and there were no significant changes in the prevalence of any of the minor INI-resistance mutations.
