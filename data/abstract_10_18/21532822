A young neutered male pug dog was presented for evaluation of acute onset pollakiuria and hematuria. Culture and susceptibility testing of urine identified a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, which was susceptible to only tetracycline among commonly used antimicrobials. Treatment with doxycycline led to bacteriological cure and resolution of clinical signs.
