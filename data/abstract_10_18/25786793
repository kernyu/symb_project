The incidence of bacterial disease has increased tremendously in the last decade, because of the emergence of drug resistance strains within the bacterial pathogens. The present study was to investigate the antibacterial compound 2,5-di-tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DTBBQ) isolated from marine Streptomyces sp. VITVSK1 as a potent antibacterial agent. The antibacterial potential of DTBBQ was investigated against RNA Polymerase (PDB ID-1I6V) by in silico molecular docking tools. Results of our study showed the high affinity interaction between DTBBQ and RNA polymerase and also confirmed the drug likeliness of DTBBQ using ADMET in silico pharmacology tools. Our findings suggest that DTBBQ could be used as antibacterial drug to defend the emerging antibacterial resistance.
