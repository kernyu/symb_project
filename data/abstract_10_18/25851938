Novel bacterial topoisomerase inhibitors (NBTIs) represent a new class of broad-spectrum antibacterial agents targeting bacterial Gyrase A and ParC and have potential utility in combating antibiotic resistance. A series of novel oxabicyclooctane-linked NBTIs with new tricyclic-1,5-naphthyridinone left hand side moieties have been described. Compounds with a (R)-hydroxy-1,5-naphthyridinone moiety (7) showed potent antibacterial activity (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus MIC 0.25 mug/mL), acceptable Gram-positive and Gram-negative spectrum with rapidly bactericidal activity. The compound 7 showed intravenous and oral efficacy (ED50) at 3.2 and 27 mg/kg doses, respectively, in a murine model of bacteremia. Most importantly they showed significant attenuation of functional hERG activity (IC50 >170 muM). In general, lower logD attenuated hERG activity but also reduced Gram-negative activity. The co-crystal structure of a hydroxy-tricyclic NBTI bound to a DNA-gyrase complex exhibited a binding mode that show enantiomeric preference for R isomer and explains the activity and SAR. The discovery, synthesis, SAR and X-ray crystal structure of the left-hand-side tricyclic 1,5-naphthyridinone based oxabicyclooctane linked NBTIs are described.
