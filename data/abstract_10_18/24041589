Fasciolasis is a zoonotic parasitic disease caused by Fasciola hepatica and its control is mainly based on the use of triclabendazole (TCBZ). Parasite resistance to different anthelmintics is growing worldwide, including the resistance of F. hepatica to TCBZ. In the present work we evaluate "in vivo" the activity of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes of phase I (carboxyl esterases) and phase II (glutathione S-transferases and carbonyl reductases) recovered of flukes from sheep treated with TCBZ. All three enzymes showed increased activity in TCBZ flukes returning 60h post-treatment at similar to baseline unexposed flukes. TCBZ action may induce secondary oxidative stress, which may explain the observed increment in activities of the analyzed enzymes as a defensive mechanism. The enzymes analyzed are candidates to participate actively in the development of resistance at TCBZ in F. hepatica.
