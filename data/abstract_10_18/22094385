The effects of the non-competitive NMDA-receptor blocker MK-801 (dizocilpine) and the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide on the delta sleep-inducing peptide (DSIP) inhibition of c-Fos immediate early gene expression were studied in the parvocellular subdivision of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (pPVN) of male Wistar rats with either high or low resistance to emotional stress, predicted from differences in their open-field behaviour. The experiments show that intraperitoneal (i.p.) DSIP injection (60 nmol/kg) decreased the number of Fos-immunoreactive (Fos-IR) cells in the pPVN, activated by immobilization. The NMDA-receptor antagonist dizocilpine (MK-801) (90 nmol i.c.v.) prevented the inhibition of c-Fos expression by DSIP in the pPVN of rats predisposed to emotional stress. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (210 nmol i.c.v.) prevented the inhibition of c-Fos expression by DSIP in the pPVN of rats that were resistant to emotional stress. The experiments indicate that the DSIP effect on c-Fos gene expression might be mediated by NMDA-receptors. DSIP may induce production of some protein transcription factors, transmitting a signal from membrane NMDA-receptors to the nucleus.
