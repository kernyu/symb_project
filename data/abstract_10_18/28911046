Infections caused by triazole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus are associated with a higher probability of treatment failure and mortality. Because clinical experience in managing these infections is still limited, mouse models of invasive aspergillosis fulfill a critical void for studying treatment regimens designed to overcome resistance. The type of immunosuppression, the route of infection, the timing of antifungal administration, and the end points used to assess antifungal activity affect the interpretation of data from these models. Nevertheless, these models provide important insights that help guide treatment decisions in patients with triazole-resistant invasive aspergillosis. Animal models confirmed that a high triazole minimal inhibitory concentration corresponded with triazole treatment failure and that the efficacy of other classes of drugs, such as the polyenes and echinocandins, was not affected by the presence of triazole resistance mutations. Furthermore, the feasibility of triazole dose escalation, combination therapy, and prophylaxis were explored as strategies to overcome resistance.
