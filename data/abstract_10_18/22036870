Various challenges face clinicians and farm managers in diagnosing, treating and preventing Rhodococcus equi pneumonia. The use of ultrasound imaging has aided in the early diagnosis of the disease, reducing treatment duration and improving therapeutic outcomes. Antimicrobial resistance in R. equi is an emerging issue that necessitates prudent antimicrobial therapy of diseased foals. Alternative methods of disease transmission, such as contagious foal-to-foal aerosol transmission, may need to be addressed to complement dust reduction environmental strategies and to minimise the overall risk of exposure of foals to highly concentrated inhaled doses of the organism. Effective management of foals and land aimed at reducing aerosol exposure to virulent R. equi is likely to yield significant reductions in the prevalence and severity of R. equi pneumonia.
