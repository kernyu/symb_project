Few cases of Campylobacter prosthetic joint infection (PJI) have been reported so far. We describe the demographic characteristics, underlying conditions, clinical features, treatment, and outcome of 8 patients with Campylobacter PJI in our hospital. All strains were confirmed at the French National Reference Center for Campylobacter and Helicobacter. Seven patients were infected with C. fetus and 1 with C. jejuni. Most patients were elderly and immunocompromised. Four had bacteremia, one of these with a pacemaker endocarditis. All the patients received at least 3 months of antibiotic treatment and 6 were treated surgically. The outcome was favorable at 2 years of follow-up in all except for 1 patient. Campylobacter PJI cases are rare but likely to become more frequent. C. fetus bacteremia should motivate physicians to look for a secondary localization such as a Campylobacter PJI.
