Antimicrobial resistance is one of the world's most pressing public health problems. The worldwide use and misuse of antimicrobials in medicine and agriculture have resulted in the selection of bacteria resistant to the microbiologic activity of these agents. These resistant bacteria fail to respond to treatment, resulting in prolonged hospitalizations, increased cost and greater risk of death. This article will review the emergence of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, with a focus on risk factors, consequences, treatment and prevention for healthcare-associated infections.
