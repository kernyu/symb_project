We investigated the prevalence of qnr and aac(6')-Ib-cr genes in water-borne environmental bacteria and in clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, as well as the subtypes of qnr. Environmental bacteria were isolated from surface water samples obtained from 10 different locations in Hangzhou City, and clinical isolates of Citrobacter freundii were isolated from several hospitals in four cities in China. qnrA, qnrB, qnrS, and aac(6')-Ib-cr genes were screened using PCR, and the genotypes were analyzed by DNA sequencing. Ten of the 78 Gram-negative bacilli isolated from water samples were C. freundii and 80% of these isolates carried the qnrB gene. qnrS1 and aac(6')-Ib-cr genes were detected in two Escherichia coli isolates and qnrS2 was detected in one species, Aeromonas punctata. The qnr and aac(6')-Ib-cr genes were present in 75 (72.8%) and 12 (11.6%) of 103 clinical isolates of C. freundii, respectively. Of the clinical C. freundii isolates with the qnr gene, 65 isolates (63.1%) carried qnrB, but only three (2.9%) and one (1.0%) carried qnrA1 and qnrS2, respectively, while five isolates carried both qnrA1 and qnrB, and one isolate carried both qnrS1 and qnrB. The qnrB9 gene was the dominant qnrB subtype, followed by qnrB8 and qnrB6. Southern hybridization studies indicated that the qnr genes are located on different plasmids. Plasmids isolated from both environmental and clinical C. freundii isolates appeared to be homogenous.
