Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the commonest bacterial infection occurring in renal disorder patients and is associated with significant morbidity. Resistance to antibiotics is highly prevalent in bacterial isolates and is an emerging problem in UTI. A hospital based cross sectional study was conducted from April 2011 to September 2011 to determine the frequency and bacterial profile of urinary tract infections in the patients with renal disorders visiting KIST Hospital along with their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. Urine samples were collected from 300 clinically-suspected cases of UTI among renal disorder patients and investigated by conventional semi-quantitative culture technique, microscopy and antibiotic susceptibility test. Significant bacteriuria were detected in 34% of the total subjects, mostly from patients with Chronic Kidney Disease. Incidence of bacteriuria was found higher in females (40.40%) than in males (27.52%) and mostly occurred in elderly patients. Escherichia coli (62.75%) was the predominant isolate followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.78%), Staphylococcus aureus (9.80%), Coagulase negative Staphylococcus aureus (CoNS) (5.88%), Enterococcus spp (3.92%), Klebsiella oxytoca (2.00%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.00%), Proteus mirabilis (2.00%) and Proteus vulgaris (1.00%). Multidrug resistance was observed in 68.82% of the total bacterial isolates.
