Chronic antibiotic suppression of cystic fibrosis (CF) infections has increased in the United States, as has isolation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa with reduced antibiotic susceptibility. However, analysis of the susceptibilities of 193 initial P aeruginosa clinical isolates suggests that antibiotic susceptibilities are comparable with wild-type strains despite expanded antipseudomonal treatment in the CF community.
