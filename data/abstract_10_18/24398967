Recent studies have demonstrated that deregulated microRNA (miR) expression is implicated in the development of human cancers. In the aberrant miR expression, miR-301 is upregulated in cancers, such as pancreatic, colorectal and oral carcinoma. Based on this evidence, we investigated the contribution of miR-301 to pancreatic carcinoma and the novel target genes of miR-301 in pancreatic carcinoma. In this study, we analyzed the effects of enforced and inhibited expression of miR-301b expression in the Panc-1 and BxPC-3 cell lines. MiR-301b expression levels were associated with cell invasiveness in both cell lines. Additional experiments indicated that miR-301b influences invasiveness through CDH1. Moreover microRNA target search algorithms and experimental strategies suggested that miR-301b suppressed TP63 expression as a novel target of miR-301b. Remarkably, miR-301b was also found to be associated with NF-kappaB activity in both cell lines. In summary, overexpressed miR-301b may suppress TP63 expression and contributes to promote cell invasiveness and to enhance gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic carcinoma cells. Thus, miR-301b may have potential as a novel therapeutic target for cancer treatment due to its stimulatory effects on cell invasiveness.
