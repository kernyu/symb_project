The aim of the study was to investigate the prevalence and the antimicrobial resistance patterns of Vibrio (V.) spp. isolated from retail shrimp in Hanoi, Vietnam A total of 202 shrimp samples were collected from retail markets located in ten urban districts of Hanoi. Among those, 201 (99.5%) samples were positive for Vibrio spp. The most common species detected was V parahaemolyticus (96.5%), followed by V. alginolyticus (56.4%), V. cholerae (2%) and V. vulnificus (1.5%). Multiple Vibrio spp. were found in 114 (56.4%) samples. None of the V. parahaemolyticus isolates carried the virulence-associated tdh (thermostable direct haemolysin) and trh (tdh-related haemolysin) genes. In total, 195 V. parahaemolyticus isolates, four V. cholerae isolates and three V. vulnificus isolates were tested for resistance to eight antimicrobial agents. V. parahaemolyticus isolates showed high rates of resistance against ampicillin (87.2%), while a moderate rate was observed for sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (18.5%) and intermediate resistance towards tetracycline (24.6%). Low resistance rates (0.5%) were recorded against both ciprofloxacin and cefalothin. Only one V. cholerae isolate with resistance to ampicillin and two V. cholerae isolates with resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim were found. All V. vulnificus isolates were susceptible to the eight antimicrobial agents tested. However, the number of V. vulnificus and V. cholerae was small. Multi-resistant isolates were found in V. parahaemolyticus with a low frequency (16.9%). The results of this study revealed the ubiquitous nature of Vibrio spp. in shrimp at retail. To reduce the potential risk of Vibrio infections due to handling or consumption of undercooked seafood, good manufacturing practice as well as safe handling and processing should be encouraged.
