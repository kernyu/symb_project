Objective: To investigate the antimicrobial susceptibility of Brucella and to provide a scientific basis for rational drug use and effective treatment of patients with brucellosis. Methods: A total of 41 Brucella strains were isolated from the blood of patients with brucellosis in 5 counties and 2 districts in Yuxi City, China from 2014 to 2016. The susceptibility to 23 antimicrobial drugs was tested using Kirby-Bauer (K-B) disk diffusion method and the sizes of antimicrobial rings were recorded. The susceptibility testing results were interpreted according to the Drug Susceptibility Testing Guideline (2009 version) . Results: The susceptibility rate of Brucella was 100.00% to ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and amikacin and >90% to cefotaxime, cefepime, imipenem, doxycycline, cefoperazone, minocycline, tobramycin, rifampicin, cefoperazone/sulbactam, and chloramphenicol. The high resistance to aztreonam and ampicillin was observed (87.80% and 41.46%). Doxycycline-intermediate strains, rifampicin-intermediate strains, and rifampicin-resistant strains were identified. Conclusion: Doxycycline and rifampicin are commonly used in the treatment of brucellosis, but doxycycline/rifampicin-intermediate and-resistant strains have been identified. The susceptibility of Brucella to fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins was high, so the two drugs can be considered in the treatment of brucellosis.
