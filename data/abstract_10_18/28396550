In this study, we characterized two tigecycline-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from dog urine samples. The isolates were genetically unrelated, belonging to sequence type 11 (ST11) and ST147, both classically related to human isolates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first identification of tigecycline-resistant isolates from animals. We unveil here the worrisome circulation among animals of bacterial clones resistant to this last-resort antibiotic.
