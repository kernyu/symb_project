A systematic review investigating the role of Xpert MTB/RIF in the diagnosis of tuberculous pleural effusion (TPE) was conducted. The pooled sensitivities and specificities of Xpert MTB/RIF were 51.4% and 98.6%, respectively, with culture used as a reference standard and 22.7% and 99.8%, respectively, with a composite reference standard (CRS) used as the benchmark. Xpert MTB/RIF has low sensitivity but excellent specificity in the diagnosis of TPE.
