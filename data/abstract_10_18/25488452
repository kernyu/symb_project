BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Candida albicans is the most common aetiological agent in funguria cases commonly observed in hospitalized patients. But a few reports are available from India where non-albicans Candida species have accounted for >50 per cent of urinary Candida isolates. We undertook this study to know the fungal profile amongst funguria cases. METHODS: A total of 123 consecutive fungal isolates obtained from clinically suspected cases of urinary tract infection from April to September, 2013, were included. Yeast species was identified by standard phenotypic methods. Antifungal susceptibility testing of yeast was performed for fluconazole (25 mug) by disc diffusion method as per Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. RESULTS: The male to female ratio was 0.92. The mean age of patients was 42.7 +/- 18.9 yr. C. tropicalis (58.5%) was the most common fungal agent followed by C. albicans (30.1%). Only one isolate of C. tropicalis was resistant to fluconazole. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: C. tropicalis and C. albicans were the predominant fungal pathogens responsible for urinary tract infection. Less resistance to fluconazole observed in the study may be due to restricted use of fluconazole in this area.
