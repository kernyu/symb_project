The aim of this study was to characterize and compare Staphylococcus spp. isolated from hospitalized patients and beef marketed in the city of Porto Velho-RO, Brazil. The isolates were subjected to antibiogram tests, adherence capacity tests, detection of the mecA gene, and epidemiological investigation by the random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique, using the primers M13 and H12. Among the 123 Staphylococcus spp. isolates, 50 were identified as S. aureus and 73 as coagulase-negative Staphylococcus; among the latter, 7 species were identified. It was observed that the coagulase-negative Staphylococcus isolates showed greater adhesion ability than S. aureus. The profile of antimicrobial susceptibility was different among isolates, all of which were susceptible to vancomycin and linezolid, and had high penicillin resistance rates, varying according to the bacterial class and the source. In this study, all strains were negative for mecA gene detection; however, 36% of S. aureus and 17% of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus were resistant to oxacillin. The genetic relationship of these bacteria, analyzed by RAPD, was able to discriminate the species of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus strains of S. aureus along its origin. It was concluded that the isolates of Staphylococcus spp. derived from beef and human infections differ genetically. Thus, it is suggested that isolates from beef, which were grouped within hospital isolates, were probably carried via contact with beef in hospital professionals or patients.
