OBJECTIVES: Although methotrexate (MTX) is the anchor drug in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), patients experience clinical resistance to MTX upon prolonged treatment. We explored whether new-generation antifolates elicit superior anti-inflammatory properties when compared to MTX, based on their capacity to inhibit tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha production. METHOD: T cells in whole blood from 18 RA patients (including MTX-naive, MTX- responsive, and MTX non-responsive patients) and seven healthy volunteers were stimulated with alphaCD3/alphaCD28 antibodies and incubated ex vivo for 72 h with MTX and eight novel antifolate drugs with potentially favourable biochemical and pharmacological properties. Drug concentrations exerting 50% inhibition (IC-50) of TNF-alpha production (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ELISA) were determined as an estimate for their anti-inflammatory capacity. In addition, induction of T-cell apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The new-generation antifolates PT523, PT644, raltitrexed, and GW1843 proved to be potent inhibitors of TNF-alpha production in activated T cells from all three groups of RA patients and from healthy volunteers. Based on IC-50 values, these antifolates were up to 10.3 times more potent than MTX. The anti-inflammatory effects were observed at drug concentrations that provoked suppression of T-cell activation and induction of apoptosis in 20-40% of activated T cells. CONCLUSION: In an ex-vivo setting, novel antifolates elicited marked inhibition of TNF-alpha production in activated T cells from RA patients. Further clinical evaluation is warranted to investigate whether a low dosage of these antifolates can elicit immunosuppressive effects equivalent to MTX, and whether they are superior to MTX in patients who fail to respond to MTX.
