Tuberculosis is an important health care problem worldwide as well as in Turkey and the control programmes are still in progress. Epidemiological data are necessary to conduct control studies related to the disease. Tuberculosis incidence and drug resistance rates are two necessary parameters which should be monitored for the effective establishment of tuberculosis control. In this objective, tuberculosis incidence and drug resistance rates were studied in young subjects performing their compulsory military service in Turkish Armed Forces. The study was performed in 14 military hospitals which served for the country-wide soldier patients. Based on the computerized medical database of these military hospitals, conscripts diagnosed with tuberculosis between January 01, 2009 and December 31, 2009 were retrospectively evaluated. Drug sensitivity tests of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates were done prior to the treatment in the two military medical training hospitals of the two big cities of Turkey (Ankara and Istanbul). There were a total of 259 new tuberculosis cases in 2009 and they were all male with a mean age of 22.51 +/- 4.63 years. The number of patients with pulmonary, extrapulmonary (pleuresia, lymphadenitis, others) and both pulmonary and extrapulmonary involvements were 175 (67.5%), 72 (27.8%) and 12 (4.6%), respectively. The total rate of pulmonary tuberculosis cases was 72.2% (187/259) and 64.7% (121/187) of them were smear positive. Since the number of soldiers in Turkish army in the midyear was 537.200; total tuberculosis, pulmonary tuberculosis and smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis incidences were estimated as 48.2/100.000, 34.8/100.000 and 22.5/100.000, respectively. Drug sensitivity tests was performed for the M.tuberculosis complex strains isolated from 104 cases. Primary resistance rate to at least one drug was detected as 16.3% (n= 17), while the rates of resistance for isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and streptomycin were 12.5% (n= 13), 7.7% (n= 8), 5.8% (n= 6) and 0.9% (n= 1), respectively. Multidrug resistant tuberculosis (isoniazid + rifampicin resistance) was detected in 6 (5.8%) patients. Our data indicated that although tuberculosis incidence among young soldiers was moderately high, a decreasing trend was observed when compared to the previous years. However, the rates of primary anti-tuberculosis drug resistance and multi-drug resistance were found to be high in our study. To decrease the incidence of tuberculosis and multidrug resistant tuberculosis, drug sensitivity tests should be performed for each patient and national tuberculosis programme should be established effectively.
