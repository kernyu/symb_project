Mycoplasma pneumoniae, a common pathogen causing community-acquired pneumonia, is also known to cause meningoencephalitis in pediatric patients. We report herein a pediatric patient with meningoencephalitis and macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae infection. We emphasize that macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae must be taken into consideration in patients with encephalitis, along with consideration for using minocycline even in pediatric patients.
