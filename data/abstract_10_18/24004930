The Dutch College of General Practitioners (NHG) practice guideline 'Urinary tract infections' intended for primary health care and the Dutch Working Party on Antibiotic Policy (SWAB) practice guideline 'Antimicrobial therapy in complicated urinary tract infections' intended for specialists in secondary care, were reviewed together. - In the NHG guideline the differentiation between 'complicated' and 'uncomplicated' urinary tract infections has been replaced by categorisation into age, sex, risk group and the presence of fever, or invasion of tissues.- If urinary tract infection has been diagnosed, a dip slide test can be used to determine resistance.- The guidelines recommend the most narrow-spectrum antibiotic to reduce further increase in antimicrobial resistance.- A chapter about women with recurrent urinary tract infections has been added to the SWAB guideline. Amongst other things, the chapter provides information on the prescription of prophylactic lactobacillus in secondary care.
