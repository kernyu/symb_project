We conducted a one-year observational study from July 2007 to June 2008 to describe the epidemiology of bacteraemia at Hamad general hospital. During this period, a total of 452 episodes of bacteraemia occurred, which corresponds to a rate of 19/1000 hospital admissions. Most patients 58.8% (266/452) had community acquired bacteraemia, and primary bacteraemia accounted for 62.2% (281/452) of the cases. The most common source of bacteraemia was intravenous catheterization in 19.2% (87/452) but no source was identified in 42.9% (194/452) of the episodes. Gram-negative organisms were isolated in 63.1% (285/452) episodes with Escherichia coli being the most frequent 21.5% (97/452). Multidrug resistance was observed in 33.3% (7/21) of all Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, 50% (6/12) of Acinetobacter isolates and 28.6% (6/21) of Enterobacter isolates, whereas all ESBL producing Klebsiella spp. and E. coli were multiresistant. The percentages of oxacillin resistant coagulase negative Staphylococci isolates and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates were 81.8% (27/33) and 13.2% (7/53) respectively. In hospital mortality was 22.5% (102/452), and inadequate treatment and septic shock were found to be independent predictors of mortality. Therefore, bloodstream infection surveillance is crucial to produce meaningful guidelines for prevention (e.g., catheter-related) and empirical treatment of bacteraemia in Qatar.
