The bacterial gastrointestinal infections cholera, salmonellosis, shigellosis, campylobacteriosis, and diarrheagenic Escherichia coli are prevalent in tropical regions. These diseases impose an immense cost and contribute significantly to childhood morbidity and mortality. Management is hampered by limited access to diagnostic facilities and by antimicrobial drug resistance. Rapid point-of-care assays aim to reduce treatment delay and encourage rational use of antimicrobial agents. Control through safe drinking water, good sanitation, and vaccination against typhoid and cholera in high-risk populations is recommended. Vaccines against other Shigella and diarrheagenic E coli infections are under development.
