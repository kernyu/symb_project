A biofilm can be defined as a community of microorganisms adhering to a surface and surrounded by a complex matrix of extrapolymeric substances. It is now generally accepted that the biofilm growth mode induces microbial resistance to disinfection that can lead to substantial economic and health concerns. Although the precise origin of such resistance remains unclear, different studies have shown that it is a multifactorial process involving the spatial organization of the biofilm. This review will discuss the mechanisms identified as playing a role in biofilm resistance to disinfectants, as well as novel anti-biofilm strategies that have recently been explored.
