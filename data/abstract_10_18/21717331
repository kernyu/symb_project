Chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP) is, usually, caused by uropathogens, especially gram-negative bacilli, although infection is sometimes due to Gram-positive and atypical microorganisms. A recent increasing in prevalence of Gram-positive strains has been reported. The aim of this study was to explore the epidemiological features and resistance rates in uropathogens isolated from CBP outpatients in last 10 years. All consecutive outpatients with demonstrated CBP attending a single Sexually Transmitted Disease centre from January 1997 and December 2008, were enrolled and underwent microbiological cultures in first void early morning urine, midstream urine, expressed prostatic secretion, and post prostate massage urine. Prevalence of different bacterial strains was stratified in four different periods: 1997-1999, 2000-2002, 2003-2005, 2006-2008. Any changes observed in epidemiological features and resistance rates in uropathogens over the whole study period have been analyzed. The present study has been planned, thus, as in vitro study. From 6,221 patients, 4,601 Gram-positive and 1,620 Gram-negative bacterial strains have been isolated. Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli strains are the first and second frequent pathogens found, respectively. Significant differences between E. faecalis prevalence in the 1997-1999 and 2006-2008 periods were found. E. coli showed a significant difference between prevalence in 1997-1999 and 2006-2008 periods. Gram-positive organisms showed a decreasing of susceptibility to ciprofloxacin as well as Gram-negative strains, while a good susceptibility to the levofloxacin was evidenced. E. faecalis prevalence seemed to be raised in 2006-2008 periods. Moreover, a decreasing of activity of ciprofloxacin and a good activity profile of levofloxacin have been reported.
