BACKGROUND: The relationship between autophagy and chemotherapy in cancer has been studied a lot recent years. However, there is currently no study on the role of autophagy in chemotherapy of adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) of human salivary glands. We hypothesized that autophagy plays a protective role for human salivary gland ACC cells during chemotherapy, diminishes the effect of treatment, and ultimately results in poor sensitivity to chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After inhibition of autophagy by 5 mM 3-methyladenine (3MA), 20 muM Chloroquine (CQ), or Beclin-1 shRNA, we examined the sensitivity of human salivary gland ACC cells to different concentrations of cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (CDDP) using MTT assay. Also, levels of autophagy in ACC cells treated by CDDP were assessed by western blot, GFP-LC3 fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). RESULTS: Inhibition of autophagy induced by 3MA, CQ, or Beclin-1 shRNA could all enhance human salivary gland ACC cell death treated by CDDP. And, levels of autophagy in these cells showed a significant increase after treated by CDDP. CONCLUSION: Autophagy played a protective role for human salivary gland ACC cells during CDDP chemotherapy. Inhibition of autophagy in these cells could enhance cisplatin cytotoxicity-effects. These findings indicate a novel and promising way to reduce chemotherapy resistance and improve treatment outcome in human salivary gland ACC.
