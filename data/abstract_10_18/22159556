Gemcitabine resistance is a common problem of pancreatic cancer chemotherapy, and how to reverse it plays an important role in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. This study investigated the effect of emodin on the gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cell line SW1990/Gem, and explored the potential mechanism of its action. SW1990/Gem was obtained by culture of the pancreatic cancer cell line SW1990 in vitro by intermittently increasing the concentration of gemcitabine in the culture medium for 10 months, observing the morphology using inverted microscopy. SW1990/Gem cells were pretreated with emodin (10 microM) for different periods followed by treatment with gemcitabine (20 microM) for 48 h; cell proliferation was tested by MTT assay. SW1990/Gem cells were treated by emodin with different concentrations for 48 h, cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry (FCM). The expression of gene and protein, such as MDR-1 (P-gp), NF-kappaB, Bcl-2, Bax, cytochrome-C (cytosol), caspase-9 and -3 were measured by RT-PCR and Western blotting. The function of P-gp in SW1990/Gem cells was checked by FCM. The results showed that the SW1990/Gem cells changed greatly in morphology and the resistance index was 48.63. Emodin promoted cell apoptosis of the gemcitabine-resistant cell line SW1990/Gem in a dose-dependent manner. Emodin enhanced the SW1990/Gem cell sensitivity to gemcitabine in a time-dependent manner. Emodin monotherapy or combination with gemcitabine both decreased the gene and protein expression levels of MDR-1 (P-gp), NF-kappaB and Bcl-2 and inhibited the function of P-gp, but increased the expression levels of Bax, cytochrome-C (cytosol), caspase-9 and -3, and promoted cell apoptosis. This demonstrated that emodin had a reversing effect on the gemcitabine-resistant cell line SW1990/Gem, possibly via decreasing the function of P-gp and activating the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in vitro.
