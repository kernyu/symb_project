Clostridia can cause unique histotoxic syndromes produced by specific toxins (e.g., gas gangrene and food poisoning) as well as non-syndromic infections (e.g., abscess, local infections, and blood born infection). Clostridia can also be recovered from various body sites as part of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic infection. These include intra-abdominal (peritonitis and abscess), biliary tract, female genital tract, abscess (rectal area and oropharyngeal), pleuropulmonary, central nervous system, and skin and soft-tissue infections. Clostridia were recovered from children with bacteremia of gastrointestinal origin, necrotizing enterocolitis, and sickle cell disease. They have also been isolated in acute and chronic otitis media, chronic sinusitis and mastoiditis, peritonsillar abscesses, and neonatal conjunctivitis. Early and aggressive surgical debridement, decompression, and drainage of affected tissues are critical to successful outcome of histotoxic infections. Effective antimicrobials include penicillin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, third-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, and vancomycin.
