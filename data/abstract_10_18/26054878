OBJECTIVES: In 2012 and 2013, a cross-sectional survey was conducted in women visiting a general practitioner for a urinary tract infection (UTI) to i) describe the patterns of antibiotic resistance of Enterobacteriaceae involved in community-acquired UTIs and ii) identify the factors associated with UTIs due to a multi-drug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (MDREB). METHODS: Urine analyses were performed systematically for all adult women presenting with signs of UTI. Characteristics of women with UTI due to MDREB were compared to those with UTI due to non-MDREB. Weighted logistic regressions were performed to adjust for the sampling design of the survey. RESULTS: Significant factors associated with MDREB included the use of penicillin by the patient in the last three months (OR = 3.1; [1.2-8.0]); having provided accommodation in the previous 12 months to a resident from a country at high risk for drug resistance (OR = 4.0; [1.2-15.1]); and the consumption of raw meat within the previous three months (OR = 0.3; [0.1-0.9]). CONCLUSIONS: In the community, antibiotic use and exposure to a person returning from an area with a high risk of drug resistance are associated with UTIs due to MDREB. The potentially protective role of raw meat consumption warrants further study.
