We develop a rapid (<4 h) and reliable multiplex polymerase chain reaction for screening of 16S rRNA methylase genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides. This study particularly underlined that 16S rRNA methylases are frequently (75%) identified among Enterobacteriaceae isolates producing the carbapenemase NDM-1.
