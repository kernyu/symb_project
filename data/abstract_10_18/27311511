We describe a method for investigating wet foci in the hospital environment of a nosocomial outbreak due to carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella oxytoca. By searching in areas that are usually inaccessible, by immersing sampling swabs in thioglycolate broth, and by concentrating the sampled water, reservoirs of infection that would have gone unnoticed can be detected.
