Recent outbreaks with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) in patients who have undergone endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) have raised concerns of whether current endoscope reprocessing guidelines are adequate to ensure a patient-safe endoscope. Unlike previous outbreaks, these CRE outbreaks occurred even though manufacturer's instructions and professional guidelines were followed correctly. This article reviews why outbreaks associated with endoscopes continue to occur; what alternatives exist that might improve the margin of safety associated with duodenoscope reprocessing; and how to prevent future outbreaks associated with ERCP procedures. The advantages and disadvantages for the proposed enhancements for reprocessing duodenoscopes are reviewed as well as future strategies to prevent GI endoscope-related outbreaks.
