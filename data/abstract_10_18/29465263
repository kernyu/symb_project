AIM: Antimicrobial resistance and inappropriate use of antibiotics in children are important issues. Consequently, there is a need to develop comprehensive stewardship programs even in hospitals with limited resources starting with children's hospitals. METHODS: Retrospective observational analysis of antimicrobial utilization and resistance patterns over 5 years in a tertiary care children's hospital in Serbia. RESULTS: Cumulative antimicrobial resistance decreased but was still high, with high cumulative resistance rates among the most widely used antibiotics in the hospital. Total antibiotic use decreased from 2010 to 2014 although there was still high prescribing of reserved antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Concerns with inappropriate use and high resistance rates among some antibiotics used in the hospital are being used to develop guidance on future antibiotic use in this hospital, building on the recently introduced antibiotic stewardship program, as well as encourage other hospitals in Serbia to review their policies.
