Periodontitis is an oral inflammatory disease of polymicrobial origin that causes the destruction of gingival connective tissue and the alveolar bone supporting the teeth. Host immune and inflammatory responses due to specific periodontopathogens and their metabolic products mediate local tissue destruction. Periodontal disease affects as many as 30% of adults and it is one of the most common chronic human diseases. However, traditional therapeutic modalities for periodontitis, including non-surgical or surgical periodontal therapy and occasional adjunctive antimicrobial therapy, have been only partially successful. Moreover, the widespread development of antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria and unwanted effects on the gut flora necessitates new strategies to better control periodontal inflammation. Recently, natural compounds capable of modulating the host inflammatory response have received considerable attention. Here we review (Pubmed 1997 to 2013) the orally-related anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory actions of polyphenols, naturally occurring molecules, capable of modulating the host inflammatory response. Of these, certain flavonoids appear to stand out because of their beneficial profile and clinical evidence. Unique formulations of novel flavonoids may be useful for further development as possible therapeutic agents for periodontal inflammation.
