REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: The increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistant bacteria such as antimicrobial-resistant and extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli represents a significant problem for human and veterinary medicine. Despite this, the risk factors for faecal carriage of such bacteria by horses in the UK, particularly those in the wider community, have not been well described. OBJECTIVES: To characterise the risk factors for faecal carriage of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli amongst horses in the mainland UK. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of horses recruited by 65 randomly selected equine veterinary practices was conducted, with a faecal sample collected and self-administered questionnaire completed by the horse owner. Faecal samples were cultured for antimicrobial-resistant E. coli, with isolates confirmed as E. coli having their antimicrobial resistance profile determined. Multilevel, multivariable logistic regression models were used to investigate risk factors for the carriage of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli in the sample population. RESULTS: Faecal samples and completed questionnaires were obtained for 627 horses located on 475 premises. Recent hospitalisation, contact with specific types of nonequid animals, the type of premises, the surrounding land use, the reason for veterinary treatment received in the last 6 months and antimicrobial treatment in the previous 10 days were identified as risk factors for many of the antimicrobial-resistance outcomes considered. Being stabled on the same yard as a recently hospitalised horse was identified as a risk factor for increased risk of carriage of ESBL-producing E. coli. CONCLUSIONS AND POTENTIAL RELEVANCE: Increasing antimicrobial resistance may have significant health implications for the horse population of Great Britain. This form of epidemiological investigation highlights potential risk factors that may be controlled to limit the extent of the problem.
