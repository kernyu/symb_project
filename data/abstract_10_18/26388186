Mycobacterium bovis is a tuberculosis causing bacterium that commonly presents with cervical lymphadenopathy. It is important to differentiate M. bovis from other Mycobacterial pathogens to ensure selection of correct anti-microbial therapy. This may decrease the number of treatment failures, the prevalence of anti-mycobacterial drug resistance patterns, and the need for surgical intervention. M. bovis has universal resistance to pyrazinamide and thus may not respond to typical first line mycobacterial drugs and may require surgical intervention. This case report and review of M. bovis cervical lymphadenitits demonstrates the need for accurate diagnosis as well as combined management with infectious disease and public health specialists.
