We report a case of a 24-year-old woman with severe pelvic abscess formation 2 weeks after secondary caesarean section. The isolated pathogens were a mixture of Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum. After initial resistance to systemic antibiotic treatment, she underwent radiologically-guided drainage of the abscesses, whereon she had a continuous recovery.
