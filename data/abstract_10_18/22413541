A variety of genetic elements play key role in the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes among gram-negative bacteria. Transposons can transfer resistance genes intracellularly, while conjugative plasmids carrying resistance genes can move from one bacterial cell to another. Integrons are genetic elements that can collect several resistance genes in the form of gene cassettes. These genetic elements sometimes coexist and work cooperatively. For example, integrons, which is not mobile by themselves, can obtain an ability to transfer when they are incorporated into transposons. Recent reports suggest that integrative and conjugative elements, hybrid elements of conjugative plasmids and phages, also contribute to the dissemination of resistance genes among gram-negative bacteria.
