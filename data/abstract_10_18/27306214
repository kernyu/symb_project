Resistance to drugs, which is aggravated by hypoxia, is a well-known feature of tumors. The combination of drug exposure and hypoxia can give rise to several survival strategies in the exposed cells. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is among the most hypoxic of solid tumors, and we have used glial cells to identify a drug combination that would be synergistically effective in these cells under both normoxia and hypoxia. Cisplatin (CP) and 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), which have been used for second-line therapy and for preclinical research, are relatively ineffective as single agents. During in vitro experiments with A172 and LN229 cells, there was increased resistance to both drugs under hypoxia. However, the combination of CP and 2-DG showed a synergistic effect in reducing cell viability under both normoxia and hypoxia, with a combination index of less than 1. Increased autophagy is a distinct feature of the response to 2-DG. However, autophagic markers were reduced, and apoptotic markers were upregulated by the combination, indicating a switch over from autophagic to apoptotic pathways with reduction in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The combination also resulted in a decrease of pAKT levels. The effect of CP in the combination was replicated by the prototype AKT inhibitor LY294002, further supporting the role of AKT inhibition in the synergism. Combination of 2-DG with CP, or possibly an AKT inhibitor, can prove to be an effective rational combination for reducing chemoresistance under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions in gliomas.
