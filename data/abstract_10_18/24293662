Peritonitis is still known as an important complication of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Multi-drug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii is an increasing problem worldwide. Moreover, the increasing reports of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii strains is common. Although peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis with MDR A. baumannii is rarely reported, infection with this organism always results in serious peritonitis and increases the possibility of dropout or mortality. Here, we present 7 cases of peritonitis caused by A. baumannii species. Among those 7 cases, 2 involved MDR A. baumannii, and 1 involved a carbapenem-resistant strain. All the MDR bacterial infections failed treatment. We also review the literature about Acinetobacter peritonitis and current treatment protocols.
