We identified the carbapenemase gene blaOXA-499, a variant of blaOXA-143, from a clinical isolate of Acinetobacter pittii for the first time. OXA-499 shared 93.1% amino acid identity with OXA-143, and the gene was located on the chromosome. By cloning the OXA-499-encoding gene into the pWH1266 vector and transforming it into susceptible Acinetobacter spp., we were able to show that OXA-499 confers resistance to carbapenems.
