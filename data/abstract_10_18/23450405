BACKGROUND: Enterococcus spp. is an important cause of nosocomial infections A number of virulence factors that may enhance its ability to colonize have been described. Enterococcus is capable of acquiring resistance genes, including high-level resistance (HLR) to aminoglycoside antibiotics. AIM: to investigate the prevalence of genes encoding virulence factors in aminoglycosides susceptible and resistant E. faecalis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 80 E. faecalis isolates from clinical (n: 52) and poultry samples (n: 28) were included in this study. Bacterial identification was performed by biochemical tests and phenotypificationwas done using the Phene-PlateTM system. Susceptibility to different antimicrobial agents was determined by the agar dilution method. Virulence genes aceI, agg, gelE and efaA were detected by multiplex PCR. RESULTS: All isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and ampicillin. HLR to gentamicin (13.5%) and streptomycin (9.6%) was detected only in clinical isolates. The phenotyping revealed a great diversity of PhP-types, but only one clone with 7 strains of similar characteristics was found. The efaA gen was detected in 100% of the isolates. aceI gene was present in 94.2% and 75%, agg gene in 73.1%, and 67.9%, and gelE gene in 57.5% and 28.6% of the clinical and chicken isolates, respectively. Only 6 strains with HLR to aminoglycosides, belonging to the same phenotype, had the aceI, agg, gelE and efaA genes. CONCLUSIONS: E. faecalis with virulence genes and HLR to aminoglycosides were isolated from clinical and chicken samples in Antofagasta. More studies will be necessary to establish an association.
