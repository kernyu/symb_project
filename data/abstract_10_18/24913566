Although carbendazim (MBC) and other benzimidazole fungicides have effectively controlled bakanae disease of rice (which is caused by Fusarium fujikuroi, F. proliferatum, and F. verticillioides) in the past, MBC resistance has become common. Previous research has shown that MBC resistance results from a mutation in the beta1 -tubulin (beta1 tub) gene in F. verticillioides. However, MBC resistance in F. fujikuroi, a predominant species in China, does not result from a mutation in the beta1 tub. The molecular mechanism of F. fujikuroi resistance against benzimidazole fungicides is poorly understood. In this study, we determined that although beta1 tub and beta2 -tubulin (beta2 tub) in F. fujikuroi have high homology with beta1 tub and beta2 tub in F. verticillioides, MBC resistance in F. fujikuroi results from mutations in beta2 tub [GAG(Glu)-->GTG(Val) at codon 198, TTC(Phe)-->TAC(Tyr) at codon 200, and GGC(Gly)-->GGT(Gly) at codon 235] but not in beta1 tub. Deltabeta2 tub (beta2 tub deletion) mutants were highly sensitive to MBC, produced fewer conidia and were less virulent than parental strains. Complementation of the Deltabeta2 tub mutants with a copy of the whole beta2 tub locus from their parental strains restored the level of MBC resistance (or sensitivity) to that of the parental strain.
