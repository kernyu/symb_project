We determined the in vitro activity of SMT19969 and 11 comparators, including metronidazole, vancomycin, and fidaxomicin, against 107 C. difficile isolates of different antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. Fidaxomicin and SMT19969 were the most active. The fidaxomicin and SMT19969 geometric mean MICs were highest in ribotypes known to show multiple resistance. Coresistance to linezolid and moxifloxacin was evident in ribotypes 001, 017, 027, and 356. The high-level ceftriaxone resistance in ribotypes 356 and 018 was location linked.
