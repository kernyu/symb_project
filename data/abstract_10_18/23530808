BACKGROUND: Nosocomial infections represent an important problem for the health of hospitalized patients. Peri-operative infections--those occurring during surgery or in the post-operative period--account for 15%-20% of cases. Most surgical site infections (SSIs) are caused by endogenous gram-positive microorganisms, in particular, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, and other coagulase-negative staphylococci that are part of the flora of the skin. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted from January 2006 to December 2010 to describe the epidemiology of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in SSIs. The MRSA isolates were analyzed by a combination of two genotyping methods: SCCmec and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Also, biofilm-forming ability was analyzed for all isolates as an indicator of their ability to persist despite antibiotic treatment. RESULTS: During the study period, 1,793 swabs from SSIs were analyzed, and S. aureus was identified in 318/987 positive specimens (32%). Methicillin resistance was observed in 10% of the S. aureus isolates (n=33). Analysis by PFGE revealed that isolates with the same SCCmec type were unrelated. Instead, biofilm-forming ability tests showed that SCCmec type I MRSA had the highest ability to form a film. CONCLUSIONS: The strains analyzed in our study showed a homogeneous pattern of SCCmec type. The difference in ability to produce biofilm between strains of SCCmec type I and isolates with other SCCmecs was substantial. This virulence factor could have critical implications for the formation and persistence of chronic SSIs.
