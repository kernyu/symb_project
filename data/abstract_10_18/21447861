Transmitted drug resistance (TDR), the primary acquisition of an HIV variant already resistant to antiretrovirals, affects approximately 15% of all new infections in the United States. Historically, from the time initial agents in the reverse transcriptase, protease and entry inhibitor classes were introduced, it took 3-5 years before the first case reports of TDR appeared. With the description of the first two cases of transmitted integrase stand-transfer inhibitor resistance, it is only a matter of time before the prevalence of TDR affecting this newest antiretroviral class reaches a level warranting baseline resistance testing for all patients entering care.
