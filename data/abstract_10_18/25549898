The prevalence of drug resistance in both clinical and community settings as a consequence of alterations of biosynthetic pathways, enzymes or cell wall architecture is a persistent threat to human health. We have designed, synthesized, and tested a novel class of non-transpeptidase, beta-lactamase resistant monocyclic beta-lactams that carry an arylthio group at C4. These thioethers exhibit inhibitory and cidal activity against serine beta-lactamase producing Mycobacterium tuberculosis wild type strain (Mtb) and multiple (n=8) beta-lactamase producing Moraxella catarrhalis clinical isolates.
