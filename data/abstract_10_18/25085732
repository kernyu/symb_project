4-Hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone (HDMF), a non-halogenated furanone found in a variety of fruits, has been shown to have antimicrobial activity. However, few studies have focused on its inhibitory effect on bacterial quorum sensing (QS) at levels below the non-inhibitory concentration. In this study, 0.1 muM HDMF decreased the production of QS signal molecules and inhibited QS-controlled biofilm formation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 without causing growth inhibition. In the presence of 0.1 and 1.0 muM HDMF, biofilm production by PAO1 was reduced by 27.8 and 42.6%, respectively, compared to that by untreated control cells. HDMF (1.0 muM) also significantly affected virulence factor expression (regulated by the las, rhl, and pqs system), resulting in a significant reduction in the production of LasA protease (53.8%), rhamnolipid (40.9%), and pyocyanin (51.4%). This HDMF-dependent inhibition of virulence factor expression was overcome by increasing the levels of two QS signal molecules of P. aeruginosa, N-(3-oxo-dodecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone and N-butyryl-L-homoserine lactone, suggesting reversible competitive inhibition between HDMF and these molecules. The results of this study indicate that HDMF has great potential as an inhibitor of QS, and that it may be of value as a therapeutic agent and in biofilm control, without increasing selective pressure for resistance development.
