BACKGROUND: Detecting plasmid-mediated AmpC (pAmpC) beta-lactamase-producing organism is important for optimal infection control and providing accurate and effective treatment option for physicians. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of pAmpC beta-lactamase and compare the results of boronic acid (BA) disk test with other phenotypic tests detecting AmpC positive isolates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 273 clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae (n: 82) and Escherichia coli (n: 191) were analysed. The presence of pAmpC beta-lactamase was determined by BA disk test, cefoxitin (FOX) screening test, modified three dimensional test (M3DT), and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was performed to evaluate the genetic similarities between isolates. To detect extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) in the presence of AmpC beta-lactamase, ESBL confirmation test was carried out with and without BA solution. RESULTS: Of the 273 strains tested, 127 strains were found FOX resistant, 114 were positive by M3DT, 108 were positive in BA disk test, and the multiplex PCR detected 24 pAmpC beta-lactamase-positive isolate. The prevalence of AmpC-producing strains was 10.9% in E. coli and 3.6% in K. pneumoniae in the tested population by PCR. CIT and MOX group genes were predominant type in these strains. CONCLUSION: These results emphasize that clinical laboratories should consider testing the presence of pAmpC enzymes particularly in FOX-resistant isolates, and BA disk test will improve detection of this emerging resistance phenotype.
