Grape marc extract (GME) showed elicitor activity on suspension-cultured cells of tobacco. The BY-2 cells reacted to GME (0.25% and 0.125%) with a long-sustained pH rise in their growth medium. Using EGTA or LaCl3, we showed that extracellular alkalinization depended on Ca(2+) mobilization. The tobacco BY-2 cells challenged with GME promoted cell death and the upregulation of defence-related genes such as PR3, PAL and CCoAOMT. Cell death rate was quantified using an experimental calibrated Evans Blue assay. The GME-induced cell death was dose-dependent and occurred in 24 h. Longer exposure increased the extent of tobacco cell death. To investigate a potential hypersensitive reaction, we tested the effect of various inhibitors of protein synthesis (cycloheximide) and proteases (aprotinin, pepstatin and E-64) on GME-induced cell death. All these chemicals reduced GME-induced cell death rate in 30 min. Overall, our findings indicate that GME elicits early perception events, defence reactions and cell death requiring protein synthesis and proteases.
