The study describes the pharmacokinetics and predicted efficacy of imipenem after intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM) and subcutaneous (SC) administration to five adult cats at a dose of 5 mg/kg. Susceptibility to imipenem [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)] was determined for antimicrobial resistant Escherichia coli (n = 13) and staphylococci (n = 3) isolated from domestic cat infections (urinary system, skin and conjunctiva). Maximum plasma concentrations of imipenem were 13.45 microg/ml (IV), 6.47 microg/ml (IM) and 3.83 microg/ml (SC). Bioavailability was 93.18% (IM) and 107.90% (SC). Elimination half-lives for IV, IM and SC administration were 1.17, 1.44 and 1.55 h, respectively. All tested bacteria were susceptible to imipenem; MIC values were 0.03 microg/ml for Staphylococcus species and <0.25-0.5 microg/ml for E coli. Mean imipenem concentrations remained above a MIC of 0.5 microg/ml for approximately 4 h (IV and IM) and 9 h (SC). Imipenem would be predicted to be effective for the treatment of antimicrobial resistant bacterial infections in cats at a dosage of 5 mg/kg every 6-8 h (IV, IM), or longer for the SC route. However, clinical trials are mandatory to establish its efficacy and proper dosing.
