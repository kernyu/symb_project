INTRODUCTION: In Colombia, Shigella sonnei is one of the most frequently isolated serotypes (53.4%) in human clinical samples associated with diarrheal acute disease. The identification of DNA restriction patterns by pulsed field gel electrophoresis is the basis for the molecular surveillance of S. sonnei . OBJECTIVE: To establish the basis for the molecular surveillance of S. sonnei in Colombia using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 102 of 2,048 S. sonnei isolates referred by the National Laboratory Network between 1997 and March, 2013; the selection was made according to the antimicrobial multiresistance profile, the source of samples, and the relation to outbreaks. The genetic profile was determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis using the restriction enzymes XbaI and BlnI in accordance with the PulseNet International protocol. The electrophoretic patterns were analyzed with the GelCompare II, version 4.0 software. RESULTS: We obtained 42 electrophoretic patterns with a 70% to 100% similarity. The most frequent pattern was COIN08J16X01.0017 with 17.6%, followed by patterns COIN04J16X01.0004 with 9.8%, and COIN02J16X01.0002 with 5.8%, while the remaining 66.8% was associated with other electrophoretic patterns. The analysis of 10 outbreaks demonstrated their genetic relation with a 100% of similarity; the most frequent pattern in outbreaks was COIN08J16X01.0017 with 17.1%. CONCLUSION: The genotypic database for Shigella sonnei isolates was established using pulsed field gel electrophoresis including the 42 unique patterns identified in this study.
