Drug-resistant microorganism infections cause serious disease and can lead to mortality and morbidity. In particular, Staphylococcus aureus induces pyrogenic and toxigenic infections, and drug-resistance occurs rapidly. Multidrug-resistant S. aureus, such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, can also cause immunodeficiency and immune deficiency syndrome from lipoteichoic acid. However, antimicrobial peptides, such as KW4, have strong antimicrobial activity, low cytotoxicity, and high neutralization activity against endotoxin substances from Gram-negative bacteria. The objective of this study was to use a synthetic KW4 antimicrobial peptide to evaluate the inhibition of drug-resistance development, antimicrobial activity, and neutralizing activity in S. aureus Gram-positive bacteria. The KW4 peptide showed strong antimicrobial activity against drug-resistant S. aureus strains and significantly increased the anti-neutralizing activity of lipoteichoic acid in S. aureus 1630 drug-resistant bacteria. In addition, S. aureus ATCC 29213 did not develop resistance to KW4 as with other antibiotic drugs. These results suggest that the KW4 peptide is an effective antibiotic and anti-neutralizing agent against multidrug-resistant S. aureus strains.
