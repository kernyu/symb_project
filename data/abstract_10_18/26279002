Parachlamydia acanthamoebae and Neochlamydia hartmanellae are Chlamydia-related bacteria naturally infecting free-living amoebae. These strict intracellular bacteria might represent emerging pathogens. Recent studies report an association with lower respiratory tract infections, especially with pneumonia where they have been identified as a potential causative agent in 1-2% of cases. In this study, we defined the antibiotic susceptibility of N. hartmanellae, two strains of P. acanthamoebae and two yet unclassified Parachlamydiaceae strains using a quantitative approach. We confirmed the results obtained earlier for P. acanthamoebae strain Bn9 in an observational study. Macrolides (MICs < 0.06-0.5 mug/ml), rifampicin (MICs 0.25-2) and doxycycline (2-4 mug/ml) were active against P. acanthamoebae strains and Neochlamydia. All strains were resistant to amoxicillin, ceftriaxone and imipenem (MIC >/=32 mug/ml). Similarly to other Chlamydia-related bacteria, all investigated Parachlamydiaceae were resistant to quinolones (MICs >/= 16 mug/ml). Therefore, we recommend a treatment with macrolides for Parachlamydia-associated pneumonia.
