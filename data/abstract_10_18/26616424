This study aimed to detect inducible clindamycin (iCLI) resistance in Staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolated from dogs in Thailand using D-zone testing. Strains that were iCLI-resistant were characterized by molecular typing and antibiogram and were detected in 10/200 S. pseudintermedius isolates (5%) from 7/41 dogs (17%). All were methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius (MRSP) and demonstrated multidrug resistance. The iCLI-resistant MRSP contained erm(B) and had identical or closely related DNA fingerprint patterns by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. All iCLI-resistant MRSP strains belonged to the same clonal complex 112 (sequence types 111 and 112) by multilocus sequence typing. To avoid misinterpretation of clindamycin susceptibility, D-zone testing is recommended to promote rational antimicrobial selection and limit the clonal expansion of multidrug resistant bacteria.
