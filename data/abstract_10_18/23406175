PURPOSE: This experimental study aimed at comparing the cyanoacrylate abdomen closure to the effectiveness of triclosan coated polidioxanone abdomen closure. METHODS: The abdomen layers were closed with 3/0 polidioxanone suture in the first group. In the second group, the layers were closed with triclosan coated polidioxanone suture in a single layer. The abdomen layers of rats in the third group were attached with cyanoacrylates without sutures. The rats were sacrificed on the 14th day and the adhesive level was recorded. The incision resistance strength was measured. The tissue was examined blindly in the terms of inflammatory cell infiltration, capillary proliferation, fibrosis and micro-abscess by the pathologist. RESULTS: No significant difference was determined between the 1st and 2nd groups in the terms of inflammatory cell infiltration, capillary proliferation, collagen deposition, fibroblast activity, adhesive and tissue distension strength. The fibrosis and adhesive rate of the 3rd group was significantly higher than the 1st and 2nd groups statistically. The tissue distension strength was lower than in the other groups and the differences between the groups were found to be significant (p < 0.05). No significant difference was determined between the groups in the term of micro-abscess. CONCLUSIONS: Antibacterial suture is not superior to the conventional suture. It is concluded that cyanoacrylate is not an appropriate molecule for abdomen closure (Tab. 1, Fig. 3, Ref. 17).
