INTRODUCTION: Members of the Bacteroides fragilis group are the most important components of the normal human gut microbiota, but these bacteria can cause severe infections as well. Due to the frequent usage of antibiotics, the spreading of the MDR strains is a real threat worldwide. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a multicentre study 400 Bacteroides isolates from five Hungarian microbiological laboratories were cultured and identified by MALDI TOF-MS. The MIC values of ten antibiotics were determined by the agar dilution method and evaluated by the breakpoints of EUCAST or CLSI. RESULTS: We found six MDR strains, and their antibiotic resistance genes were investigated by molecular methods The DNA amplicon of B. fragilis SZ38 strain was sequenced to look for a mutation in the gyrA gene. Among the six MDR isolates we found one cfiA-, two cepA, three cfxA-, two ermG-, six tetQ- three tetX- and two bexA-positive strains. None of them harboured cepA, nim, ermB and tetX1 genes. DISCUSSION: In the past 12 years only a few cases of MDR Bacteroides infections have been published. Within a comprehensive multicenter survey we demonstrated the relatively large prevalence of MDR strains isolated in one centre with five isolates and one from another centre during a relatively short period of time. This study focused on the importance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing and surveillance among B. fragilis group isolates.
