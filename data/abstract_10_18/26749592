BACKGROUND: Infection with Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli are recognized as the major cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in humans. METHODS: A total of 310 fecal samples collected from Thai adult patients with diarrhea in 2008 were screened for the presence of Campylobacter by PCR. Resistance to fluoroquinolone and macrolides of the detected Campylobacter strains were analyzed by studying the mutations in the gyrA and 23S rRNA genes, respectively. RESULTS: Campylobacter species were detected in 4/310 (1.3%) of diarrheal patients, and C. jejuni was found in 3 of the 4 cases (75%). Fluoroquinolone resistance was noted in 2 cases (50%); however, no resistance to macrolides was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Campylobacter was detected in a low prevalence in adult Thai patients hospitalized with diarrhea, and the resistance to fluoroquinolones is still a matter of concern in case antibiotic therapy is required.
