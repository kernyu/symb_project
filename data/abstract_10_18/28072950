Objective: To understand the epidemiological and etiological characteristics of bacillary dysentery in Xinjiang Uigur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang) during 2004-2014, and provide evidence for the prevention and control of bacillary dysentery. Methods: Descriptive epidemiological analysis was conducted by using the incidence data of bacillary dysentery in Xinjiang during 2004-2014 and the serotyping and the antibiotic susceptibility test of the pathogens isolated were performed. Results: A total of 123 238 cases of bacillary dysentery were reported in Xinjiang from 2004 to 2014. The average annual incidence of bacillary dysentery ranged from 25.91 per 100 000 to 76.04 per 100 000 and the average annual mortality ranged from 0.00 to 46.90 per 100 000. The incidence of bacillary dysentery was higher in eastern Xinjiang than other areas. The incidence peak was during July-September. The incidence of bacillary dysentery in males was higher than that in females. The incidence was highest in infants and young children under five years old. Most cases were children outside child care settings, farmers and students. Shigella flexneri was the predominant pathogen and F2a was the most frequently detected subtype. The isolated strains were highly resistant to streptomycin, penicillin, doxycycline and tetracycline. The resistant rates to penicillin, tetracycline, doxycycline and streptomycin increased with year. Up to 71.43% of the strains were resistant to more than five antibiotics. Conclusion: The incidence of bacillary dysentery was in decrease in Xinjiang from 2004 to 2014, but in some area, the incidence of bacterial dysentery was higher than national average level. It is necessary to strengthen the surveillance and conduct targeted prevention and control in areas and population at high risk and in season with high incidence. The serious drug resistance and multi drug resistance of the pathogens have posed challenge to the prevention and treatment of bacillary dysentery in Xinjiang.
