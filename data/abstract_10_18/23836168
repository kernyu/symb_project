The feasibility of fidaxomicin versus vancomycin and metronidazole (conventional therapy) was assessed in 59 transplant recipients with 61 episodes of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD). Overall clinical cure was achieved in 86% of episodes, and in 7% of episodes, infection recurred. Fidaxomicin was well tolerated. Clinical cures were not significantly different compared with conventional therapy (67% versus 89%, respectively; P = 0.06). Univariate analysis of predictors for lack of clinical cure included continued use of broad-spectrum systemic antibiotics (P = 0.026) and prior diagnosis of CDAD (95% confidence interval, 1.113 to 19.569; odds ratio, 4.667; P = 0.041). New-onset vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) colonization was not noted after fidaxomicin therapy alone. However, this occurred in 10 of 28 patients (36%) following conventional therapy, and 2 of 3 patients with subsequent bacteremia died.
