In clinical trials of coformulated elvitegravir (EVG), cobicistat (COBI), emtricitabine (FTC), and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), emergent drug resistance predominantly involved the FTC resistance substitution M184V/I in reverse transcriptase (RT), with or without the tenofovir (TFV) resistance substitution K65R, accompanied by a primary EVG resistance substitution (E92Q, N155H, or Q148R) in integrase (IN). We previously reported that the RT-K65R, RT-M184V, and IN-E92Q substitutions lacked cross-class phenotypic resistance and replicative fitness compensation. As a follow-up, the in vitro characteristics of mutant HIV-1 containing RT-K65R and/or RT-M184V with IN-Q148R or IN-N155H were also evaluated, alone and in combination, for potential interactions. Single mutants displayed reduced susceptibility to their corresponding inhibitor classes, with no cross-class resistance. Viruses with IN-Q148R or IN-N155H exhibited reduced susceptibility to EVG (137- and 40-fold, respectively) that was not affected by the addition of RT-M184V or RT-K65R/M184V. All viruses containing RT-M184V were resistant to FTC (>1,000-fold). Mutants with RT-K65R had reduced susceptibility to TFV (3.3- to 3.6-fold). Without drugs present, the viral fitness of RT and/or IN mutants was diminished relative to that of the wild type in the following genotypic order: wild type > RT-M184V >/= IN-N155H approximately IN-Q148R >/= RT-M184V + IN-N155H >/= RT-M184V + IN-Q148R >/= RT-K65R/M184V + IN-Q148R approximately RT-K65R/M184V + IN-N155H. In the presence of drug concentrations approaching physiologic levels, drug resistance counteracted replication defects, allowing single mutants to outcompete the wild type with one drug present and double mutants to outcompete single mutants with two drugs present. These results suggest that during antiretroviral treatment with multiple drugs, the development of viruses with combinations of resistance substitutions may be favored despite diminished viral fitness.
