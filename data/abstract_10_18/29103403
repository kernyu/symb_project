Group B Streptococcal isolates (n = 235) from the South of Ireland were characterised by serotyping, antimicrobial susceptibility and determination of the phenotypic and genotypic mechanisms of resistance. Resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin was observed in 21.3% and 20.4% of the total population, respectively. The c-MLSB phenotype was the most common phenotype detected (62%), with ermB being the predominant genetic determinant, present in 84% of resistant isolates. The rare L phenotype was observed in 2.9% (n = 7) of isolates, four of which harboured the lsaC gene responsible for clindamycin resistance. Serotypes Ia, III and II were the most common amongst the entire study population (28.1%, 24.7% and 14%, respectively). Four of the seven L phenotype isolates were serotype III and two of these strains were confirmed as the hypervirulent clone, ST-17 and harboured the hvgA gene. This is the first documented case of the L phenotype in Ireland to date and the study findings emphasise the need for continued monitoring of antibiotic resistance and serotype distribution in GBS isolates from Ireland.
