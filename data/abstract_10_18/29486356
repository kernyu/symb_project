BACKGROUND: Rezafungin (CD101) is a novel echinocandin currently under development. The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic literature review of published evidence on CD101 and an antimicrobial stewardship audit of real-world use of echinocandins to determine areas of unmet medical need and potential places in therapy for rezafungin. METHODS: A systematic literature review on rezafungin identified eight peer-reviewed manuscripts and 19 separate abstracts. A stewardship audit was performed on hospitalized patients given echinocandins to better understand potential future areas of use for rezafungin. RESULTS: Rezafungin is a cyclic hexapeptide with a lipophilic tail derived from anidulafungin with a choline moiety at the C5 ornithine position that results in increased in vitro and in vivo stability compared to other echinocandins. Microbiologic data showed similar susceptibility and resistance development between rezafungin and other echinocandins. Rezafungin has a long half-life (80hours) and a favorable safety profile that allows for high doses (up to 400mg) given once weekly. A phase II study is ongoing. The antimicrobial stewardship audit of echinocandin identified several areas of possible use for rezafungin including patients who received daily echinocandins for greater than seven days, patients who remained in the hospital to complete a full course of daily echinocandin therapy, and patients required an echinocandin scheduled via an infusion clinic after discharge. CONCLUSION: Rezafungin is a novel echinocandin currently in phase II studies, differentiated by a long half-life that allows once-weekly dosing and a safety profile that allows higher doses. Several potential areas of use for rezafungin were identified.
