BACKGROUND: Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection is a major cause of community-acquired pneumonia in children. We performed a retrospective study to evaluate the clinical impact of the timing of azithromycin treatment in children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia in high macrolide-resistant prevalence settings. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A total of 623 patients were enrolled in this study and were divided into 2 groups according to the timing of azithromycin therapy. Children who received azithromycin within 3 days (72 hours) after the onset of Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia were classified into the early azithromycin treatment group (n = 174), whereas the late azithromycin treatment group (n = 449) comprised children treated with azithromycin more than 72 hours after symptom onset. We evaluated clinical prognosis according to demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics. Although the early azithromycin treatment group exhibited a longer fever duration after azithromycin administration (7.17+/-4.12 versus 4.82+/-3.99 days, P<0.01), the total fever duration exhibited no significant difference (9.02+/-4.58 versus 9.57+/-4.91 days, P = 0.212). After azithromycin therapy, the two groups exhibited no significant differences with respect to improvements in the laboratory and radiological findings (all P>0.05). CONCLUSION: The timing of azithromycin treatment is not associated with the clinical prognosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia in children in high macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae prevalence settings.
