While azole drugs targeting the biosynthesis of ergosterol are effective antifungal agents, their extensive use has led to the development of resistant organisms. Infections involving azole-resistant forms of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus are often associated with genetic changes in the cyp51A gene encoding the lanosterol alpha14 demethylase target enzyme. Both a sequence duplication in the cyp51A promoter (TR34) and a substitution mutation in the coding sequence (L98H) are required for the full expression of azole resistance. A mechanism commonly observed in pathogenic yeast such as Candida albicans involves gain-of-function mutations in transcriptional regulatory proteins that induce expression of genes encoding ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. We and others have found that an ABC transporter protein called Cdr1B (here referred to as AbcG1) is required for wild-type azole resistance in A. fumigatus Here, we test the genetic relationship between the TR34 L98H allele of cyp51A and an abcG1 null mutation. Loss of AbcG1 from a TR34 L98H cyp51A-containing strain caused a large decrease in the azole resistance of the resulting double-mutant strain. We also generated antibodies that enabled the detection of both the wild-type and L98H forms of the Cyp51A protein. The introduction of the L98H lesion into the cyp51A gene led to a decreased production of immunoreactive enzyme, suggesting that this mutant protein is unstable. Our data confirm the importance of AbcG1 function during azole resistance even in a strongly drug-resistant background.
