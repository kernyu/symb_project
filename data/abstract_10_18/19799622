To protect themselves, plants have evolved an armoury of defences in response to pathogens and other stress situations. These include the production of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins and the accumulation of antimicrobial molecules such as phytoalexins. Here we report that resistance of tobacco to Botrytis cinerea is cultivar specific. Nicotiana tabacum cv. Petit Havana but not N. tabacum cv. Xanthi or cv. samsun is resistant to B. cinerea. This resistance is correlated with the accumulation of the phytoalexin scopoletin and PR proteins. We also show that this resistance depends on the type of B. cinerea stage. Nicotiana tabacum cv. Petit Havana is more resistant to spores than to mycelium of B. cinerea. This reduced resistance of N. tabacum cv. Petit Havana to the mycelium compared with spores is correlated with the suppression of PR proteins accumulation and the capacity of the mycelium, not the spores, to metabolize scopoletin. These data present an important advance in understanding the strategies used by B. cinerea to establish its disease on tobacco plants.
