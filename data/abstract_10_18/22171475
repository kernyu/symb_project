The gag, pol, and env genomic regions of HIV-1 variants currently circulating in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) were analyzed. The results of the study indicated that in this area there were HIV-1 variants belonging to two subtypes: A (IDU-A) and B, the former being predominant in this area and in the Russian Federation. The IDU-B-East strain was first isolated from a heterosexually infected patient, which suggests that the strain is outside the risk group of injection drug users. No cases of primary infection with resistant variants were notified during the study.
