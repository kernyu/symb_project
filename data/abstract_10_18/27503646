Entecavir (ETV) is a first-line antiviral agent for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Renal excretion is the major elimination path of ETV, in which tubular secretion plays the key role. However, the secretion mechanism has not been clarified. We speculated that renal transporters mediated the secretion of ETV. Therefore, the aim of our study was to elucidate which transporters contribute to the renal disposition of ETV. Our results revealed that ETV (50 muM) remarkably reduced the accumulation of probe substrates in MDCK cells stably expressing human multidrug and toxin efflux extrusion proteins (hMATE1/2-K), organic cation transporter 2 (hOCT2), and carnitine/organic cation transporters (hOCTNs) and increased the substrate accumulation in cells transfected with multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (hMRP2) or multidrug resistance protein 1 (hMDR1). Moreover, ETV was proved to be a substrate of the above-described transporters. In transwell studies, the transport of ETV in MDCK-hOCT2-hMATE1 showed a distinct directionality from BL (hOCT2) to AP (hMATE1), and the cellular accumulation of ETV in cells expressing hMATE1 was dramatically lower than that of the mock-treated cells. The accumulation of ETV in mouse primary renal tubular cells was obviously affected by inhibitors of organic anion transporter 1/3 (Oat1/3), Oct2, Octn1/2, and Mrp2. Therefore, the renal uptake of ETV is likely mediated by OAT1/3 and OCT2 while the efflux is mediated by MATEs, MDR1, and MRP2, and OCTN1/2 may participate in both renal secretion and reabsorption.
