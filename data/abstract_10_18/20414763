Urosepsis is one of the most frequent sepsis entities. Mortality from urosepsis is nowadays mostly lower than from other entities. Sepsis syndrome is pathophysiologically characterized by a generalized infection and immune dysregulation. Exogenous microbiological and active or passive endogenous factors released from body cells initiate and accompany the immune dysregulation. Diagnosis and therapy of urosepsis need to be instigated as early as possible (within the first hour), in order to prevent cell and tissue damage in the early phase. For this reason a series of measures is started, aimed at achieving early control of the focus of infection, providing antibiotic treatment, and stabilizing respiratory and cardiovascular function in order to optimize tissue oxygenation. A significant clinical problem ensues due to increasing antibiotic resistance mainly of enterobacteria. The choice of antibiotic therefore is made on the basis of local antibiotic resistance statistics. Dosage is determined on an individual basis, as well as according to current pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic knowledge. The intensive care of the septic patient needs to be started as early as on patient admission and, where necessary, continued on the intensive care ward.
