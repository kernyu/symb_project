The emergence of carbapenemase-producing bacteria poses a new challenge in the management of antibiotic therapies for patients. This report describes a new method using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) for rapid detection of carbapenemase activity in enterobacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. In a panel of 78 isolates, including 41 carbapenemase-producing strains, the ULPC-MS/MS assay showed 100% agreement with molecular characterization, whereas six carbapenemase-producing isolates were not detected by the modified Hodge test.
