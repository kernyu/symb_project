Samples were taken under strictly anaerobic conditions from the root canals of 22 patients having a tooth in which necrotic pulp was associated with an inflammatory peri-apical lesion an optical periodontitis. In the majority of cases (85%), these lesions were chronic and the pulp chamber was closed. One hundred and two strains were isolated, 71.7% of the bacteria being obligate anaerobes and 49.8% being Gram-negative bacilli. Their ability to produce beta-lactamases was tested and 8.8% gave a positive reaction in a cefinase test. These cefinase positive strains were nevertheless susceptible to 3rd-generation cephalosporins (cefoxitin) and to amoxicillin-clavulanate, with the exception of M. Morganii.
