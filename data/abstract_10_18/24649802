A series of oseltamivir analogues bearing an N-substituted guanidine unit were prepared and evaluated as inhibitors of neuraminidases from four strains of influenza. The two most potent analogues identified contain relatively small N-guanidine substituents (N-methyl and N-hydroxyl) and display enhanced inhibition with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range against neuraminidases from wild-type and oseltamivir-resistant strains. Potential advantages of including the N-hydroxyguanidine moiety in neuraminidase inhibitors are also discussed.
