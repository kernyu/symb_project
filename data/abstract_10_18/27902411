Non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is a common opportunistic bacterial pathogen that primarily infects the respiratory mucosa. This study was conducted to assess clinical and microbiological data related to disease severity in patients with lower respiratory tract infections caused by NTHi in a tertiary care hospital in Mexico. NTHi isolates were subjected to serotyping, antimicrobial susceptibility evaluationand analyses of beta-lactamase production, genetic relatednessand biofilm formation. Clinical and demographic data were retrieved from patients' records. The mean age of the patients was 40.3 years; the majority (n=44, 72.1 %) were male. The main comorbidities were arterial hypertension (n=22, 36.1 %) and diabetes mellitus (n=17, 27.9 %). NTHi isolates (n=98) were recovered from tracheal aspirate (n=57, 58.2 %), sputum (n=26, 26.5 %)and bronchial aspirate (n=15, 15.3 %) specimens. Low resistance to cefotaxime (n=0, 0.0 %), rifampin (n=1, 1.1 %) and chloramphenicol (n=3, 3.2 %) and greater resistance to ampicillin (n=30, 32.3 %) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (n=49, 52.7 %) were detected. beta-Lactamase production was found in 17 (17.3 %) isolates. Isolates displayed high genetic diversity, and only 10 (10.2 %) were found to be biofilm producers. The antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of biofilm-producing and non-producing isolates did not differ. Biofilm production was associated with prolonged hospital stay (P=0.05). Lower respiratory NTHi isolates from Mexico showed low antimicrobial resistance and weak biofilm production. Younger age was correlated with lower Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (moderate, P=0.07; severe, P=0.03).
