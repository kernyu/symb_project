The evolution from microarrays to transcriptome deep-sequencing (RNA-seq) and from RNA interference to gene knockouts using Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPRs) and Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases (TALENs) has provided a new experimental partnership for identifying and quantifying the effects of gene changes on drug resistance. Here we describe the results from deep-sequencing of RNA derived from two cytarabine (Ara-C) resistance acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines, and present CRISPR and TALEN based methods for accomplishing complete gene knockout (KO) in AML cells. We found protein modifying loss-of-function mutations in Dck in both Ara-C resistant cell lines. CRISPR and TALEN-based KO of Dck dramatically increased the IC(5)(0) of Ara-C and introduction of a DCK overexpression vector into Dck KO clones resulted in a significant increase in Ara-C sensitivity. This effort demonstrates the power of using transcriptome analysis and CRISPR/TALEN-based KOs to identify and verify genes associated with drug resistance.
