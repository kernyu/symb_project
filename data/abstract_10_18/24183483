We report the first isolation and characterization of several Enterobacteriaceae strains harboring bla(NDM-1), bla(OXA-48) and/or bla(OXA-181) genes in a Romanian emergency teaching hospital. Between January 2010 and September 2012 nine carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae strains were identified. The bla(NDM-1) gene was present in two Enterobacter cloacae strains, an Escherichia coli and two Klebsiella pneumoniae strains. One of these K. pneumoniae strains also harbored the bla(OXA-181) gene. Three other K. pneumoniae strains and one Serratia marcescens carried bla(OXA-48).
