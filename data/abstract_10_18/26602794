CONTEXT: Emm1-type group A Streptococcus (GAS), or Streptococcus pyogenes, is mostly responsible for invasive infections such as necrotizing fasciitis (NF) and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS). The recommended treatment of severe invasive GAS infections is a combination of clindamycin and penicillin. Until 2012, almost all emm1 isolates were susceptible to clindamycin. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to identify the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of emm1 GAS clone resistant to clindamycin. METHODS: GAS strains were characterized by emm sequence typing, detection of genes encoding pyrogenic exotoxins or superantigens. Cluster analysis was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Antibiotic susceptibility was assessed using disk diffusion and resistance genes were detected by PCR. RESULTS: A total of 1321 GAS invasive isolates were analyzed between January 2011 and December 2012. The overall number of invasive isolates resistant to clindamycin was 52 (3.9%); seven of them were emm1 isolates. All isolates had the same genomic markers: macrolide resistance due to the presence of the erm(B) gene, emm subtype 1.0, the same toxin or superantigen profile, PFGE pattern and sequence type. CONCLUSION: This is the first description of highly virulent GAS emm1 isolates resistant to clindamycin in France. This article strengthens the need for monitoring the epidemiology of invasive GAS strains as they could lead to changes in treatment guidelines.
