Antibiotic resistant enterococci are an emerging problem, especially in urinary tract infections. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the antimicrobial susceptibility of 118 enterococci isolates from urine samples of patients admitted to Malatya State Hospital, a secondary care hospital in eastern Turkey. The Vitek 2 automated sytem was used to identify the bacteria and detect antimicrobial susceptibility to ten antibiotics: ampicillin, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, quinupristin-dalfopristin, tetracycline, tigecyclin, linezolid, vancomycin, teicoplanin and high level aminoglycoside resistance (HLAR) against kanamycin, gentamicin and streptomycin. The predominant species was Enterococci faecalis (74.5%) followed by Enterococcus faecium (18.6%). The resistance rates for Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium, were 54.5%/77.2% for ampicillin, 0/77.2% for imipenem, 18.1%/72.7% for both ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin, 10.2%/9.1% for linezolid and 65.1%/5.2% for quinopristine-dalfopristin, respectively. Beta-lactamase production was detected in 54.5% of E. faecalis isolates. HLAR was also found in 54.5% of E. faecalis isolates and 36.3% of E. faecium isolates; kanamycin resistance comprised the highest proportions (39.7% and 9.1%) of these resistance rates. Five strains were resistant to and one had intermediate resistant to vancomycin. The highest resistance rates were against ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin and tetracycline. Of the antimicrobial agents evaluated, vancomycin, teicoplanin and tigecycline had the lowest resistance rates.
