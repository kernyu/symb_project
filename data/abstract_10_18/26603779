Antimicrobial peptides are a potent class of antibiotics. In the Gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis the synthetic peptide RWRWRW-NH2 integrates into the bacterial membrane and delocalizes essential peripheral membrane proteins involved in cell wall biosynthesis and respiration. A lysine residue has been added to the hexapeptide core structure, either C or N-terminally. Lipidation of the lysine residues by a C8-acyl chain significantly improved antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Here, we report a comparative proteomic study in B. subtilis on the mechanism of action of the lipidated and non-lipidated peptides. All derivatives depolarized the bacterial membrane without forming pores and all affected cell wall integrity. Proteomic profiling of the bacterial stress responses to the small RW-rich antimicrobial peptides was reflective of non-disruptive membrane integration. Overall, our results indicate that antimicrobial peptides can be derivatized with lipid chains enhancing antibacterial activity without significantly altering the mechanism of action.
