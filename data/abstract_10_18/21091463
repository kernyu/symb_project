OBJECTIVE: To report the level of anthelmintic resistance on 13 commercial cattle properties in south-west Victoria, Australia. PROCEDURE: Between 2006 and 2009 worm egg count reduction tests were conducted on calves on the 13 properties. Samples were collected 10-14 days post anthelmintic treatment and worm egg counts and larval differentiation tests were conducted. Resistance was defined if there was less than 95% reduction (lower confidence limit <90%) in the faecal worm egg count for the particular genus. RESULTS: The percentage of properties with anthelmintic resistance in at least one species was 54% for benzimidazole (BZ), 100% for levamisole (LEV) and for ivermectin (IVM) it was 100% for the half-dose (0.1 mg/kg) and 62% for the full dose (0.2 mg/kg). A substantial frequency of resistance was detected in Ostertagia ostertagi to BZ (5/11), LEV (3/3) and IVM (5/11), in Trichostrongylus spp. to BZ (4/7) and in Cooperia spp. to IVM (6/11). No resistance to LEV was detected in Trichostrongylus or Cooperia spp. Suspected IVM-resistant Trichostrongylus spp. and BZ-resistant Cooperia spp. were only detected on one property each. CONCLUSION: This is the first Australian report of macrocyclic lactone-resistant O. ostertagi in the refereed literature. The frequency of resistance in O. ostertagi to BZ, LEV and IVM and in Trichostrongylus spp. to BZ in the present study appears higher than levels detected in the 2004-05 New Zealand survey, whereas the resistance frequency in Cooperia spp. to IVM and BZ was less.
