This study explored the effects of pantothenic acid (PA) on the immune and physical barrier function, and relative mRNA levels of signaling molecules in the gill of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). The results indicated that compared with optimal PA supplementation, PA deficiency (1.31 mg/kg diet) decreased gill interleukin 10, transforming growth factor beta1, inhibitor of kappaBalpha (IkappaBalpha), eIF4E-binding protein 2, Claudin b and ZO-1 mRNA levels; anti-superoxide anion activity, and activities and mRNA levels of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase, manganese superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and NF-E2-related factor (P < 0.05). Additionally, PA deficiency and excess (75.08 mg/kg diet) decreased gill complement 3 and glutathione contents, lysozyme and acid phosphatase, anti-hydroxy radical, catalase and glutathione S-transferases activities, and liver-expression antimicrobial peptide 2, hepcidin, Claudin 3, Claudin c and Occludin mRNA levels (P < 0.05). Conversely, PA deficiency increased gill reactive oxygen species and protein carbonyl contents, and interferon gamma2, interleukin 8, nuclear factor kappa B P65, Claudin 15a, Kelch-like ECH-associating protein 1a and Kelch-like ECH-associating protein 1b mRNA levels (P<0.05). Moreover, PA deficiency and excess increased gill malondialdehyde content, and tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1beta, IkappaB kinase alpha, IkappaB kinase beta, IkappaB kinase gamma, target of rapamycin and ribosomal S6 protein kinase1 p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases and myosin light-chain kinase mRNA levels (P<0.05). In conclusion, PA de fi ciency decreased immune and physical barrier function, and regulated relative mRNA levels of signaling molecules in fish gill. Based on the quadratic regression analysis of gill lysozyme activity, the optimal PA levels in grass carp (253.44-745.25 g) were estimated to be 36.97 mg/kg diet.
