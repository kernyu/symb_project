In order to investigate new effective and inexpensive nano-therapeutic approach for P. aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS), the present study reports an eco-friendly process for rapid synthesis of silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) using aqueous leaf extract of Corchorus Capsularis (CRCP). Formation of stable Ag-NPs at different time intervals gives mostly spherical particles with diameters ranging from 5 to 45 nm. The resulting Ag-NPs were characterized using Ultraviolet visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). XRD study shows that the particles are crystalline in nature with face centered cubic geometry. TEM studies show the formation of Ag-NPs with average size of 20.52 nm. The antimicrobial activity of the synthesized Ag-NPs was investigated against multi drug resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and CoNS isolates from post-surgical wound infections. The present study suggests that Ag-NPs synthesized from aqueous leaf extract of CRCP shows significant antibacterial potential against MDR isolates from post-surgical wound infections.
