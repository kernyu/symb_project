Multidrug-resistant mutants ofPseudomonas aeruginosathat overproduce the active efflux system MexEF-OprN (callednfxCmutants) have rarely been characterized in the hospital setting. Screening of 221 clinical strains exhibiting a reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (a substrate of MexEF-OprN) and imipenem (a substrate of the negatively coregulated porin OprD) led to the identification of 43 (19.5%)nfxCmutants. Subsequent analysis of 22 nonredundant mutants showed that, in contrast to theirin vitro-selected counterparts, only 3 of them (13.6%) harbored a disruptedmexSgene, which codes for the oxidoreductase MexS, whose inactivation is known to activate themexEF-oprNoperon through a LysR-type regulator, MexT. Nine (40.9%) of the clinicalnfxCmutants contained single amino acid mutations in MexS, and these were associated with moderate effects on resistance and virulence factor production in 8/9 strains. Finally, the remaining 10 (45.5%)nfxCmutants did not display mutations in any of the regulators known to controlmexEF-oprNexpression (themexS,mexT,mvaT, andampRgenes), confirming that other loci are responsible for pump upregulation in patients. Collectively, these data demonstrate thatnfxCmutants are probably more frequent in the hospital than previously thought and have genetic and phenotypic features somewhat different from those ofin vitro-selected mutants.
