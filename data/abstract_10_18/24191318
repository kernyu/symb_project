In the year 2003 to 2005 a prospective study was conducted to find out the predominance of Staphylococcus (Staphylococcus aureus) resistance pattern in opposition to five life saving antibiotics as these are the sole agents to treat critically ill patients in hospitals. During the period of two years almost 2500 samples of bacterial culture were taken from different pathological laboratories and hospitals in Karachi. Among these 1500 were Gram positive cocci and 1000 samples were identified as Staphylococcus aureus. Life saving antibiotics were taken from five different groups and by mean of disk diffusion technique antibiogram of Staphylococcus aureus against these antibiotic were determined. During the course of study imipenem showed 11%, amikacin exhibited 58%, cefipime showed 31%, vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam displayed 24% resistance against Staphylococcus aureus. Imipenem was found to be most effective against Staphylococcus aureus.Resistance to other antibiotics developed quickly in Staphylococcus aureus collected from clinical areas where these antimicrobial agents are extensively used.
