OBJECTIVES: The presence of ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli in cattle has been reported previously, however information on veal calves is limited. This study describes the prevalence and molecular characteristics of E. coli with non-wild type susceptibility to cefotaxime in veal calves at slaughter. METHODS: Faecal samples from 100 herds, 10 individual animals per herd, were screened for E. coli with non-wild type susceptibility for cefotaxime. Molecular characterization of ESBL/AmpC genes and plasmids was performed on one isolate per herd by microarray, PCR and sequence analysis. RESULTS: 66% of the herds were positive for E. coli with non-wild type susceptibility for cefotaxime. Within-herd prevalence varied from zero to 90%. 83% of E. coli producing ESBL/AmpC carried bla(CTX-M) genes, of which bla(CTX-M-1), bla(CTX-M-14) and bla(CTX-M-15) were most prevalent. The dominant plasmids were IncI1 and IncF-type plasmids. CONCLUSIONS: A relatively high prevalence of various bla(CTX-M) producing E. coli was found in veal calves at slaughter. The genes were mainly located on IncI1 and IncF plasmids.
