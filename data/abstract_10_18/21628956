Sanguinarine is a benzophenanthridine alkaloid derived from the root of Sanguinaria canadensis. It is known to perform a wide spectrum of biological activities. The aim of this study is to examine the antimicrobial actions of sanguinarine against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Sanguinarine antimicrobial activity was assessed by broth dilution method; its mechanism of action was investigated by bacteriolysis, detergent or ATPase inhibitors and transmission electron microscopy were used to monitor the survival characteristics and the changes in bacteria morphology. The activity of sanguinarine against MRSA strains ranged from 3.12 to 6.25 microg/ml, while the minimum inhibitory concentrations of the two reference strains are 3.12 microg/ml and 1.56 microg/ml. The treatment of the cells with sanguinarine induced the release of membrane-bound cell wall autolytic enzymes, which eventually resulted in lysis of the cell. The OD(600s) of the suspensions treated with the combination of Tris-(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane and Triton X-100 with sanguinarine were reduced to 40% and 8%, respectively. Transmission electron microsco-py of MRSA treated with sanguinarine showed alterations in septa formation. The predisposition of lysis and the altered morphology seen by transmission electron microscopy suggest that sanguinarine compromises the cytoplasmic membrane.
