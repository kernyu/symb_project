Twenty-nine community-onset methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CO-MRSA) isolates were prospectively selected according to epidemiological criteria among 374 MRSA isolates collected in our laboratory during 2009-2010 in order to determine which community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) and healthcare-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) clones are circulating in the community in northern Spain. PVL genes were detected in 5 strains (17.2%) that belonged to SCCmec type IV or V and to the agr group I (ST8 and ST2050), agr group II (ST121), and agr group III (ST30 and ST852). These strains were isolated from patients with different clinical manifestations such as urinary tract infection, abscess, or pneumonia, and most of them belonged to emergency department patients with no history of visits to General Practitioners (GPs) in the year before the isolation. We considered that the prevalence of CA-MRSA in community-onset isolates was low (17.2%). A high proportion of the CO-MRSA strains (58.6%) were ST125-MRSA-IVc (CC5), responsible for most of the infections caused by HA-MRSA strains in Spain. This endemic clone is also circulating in the community of northern Spain as we could demonstrate in this study. Antimicrobial resistance was found in spa type t067 isolates linked to the presence of ant(4')-Ia and msr(A). Most of the CO-MRSA isolates in this study corresponded to spa types more associated to the hospital environment, suggesting the interchange of genetic lineages of MRSA among community and hospital niches.
