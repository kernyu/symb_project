Unnecessary antibiotic prescribing has tremendous cost to both the individual and to society in terms of drug resistance, adverse drug reactions and economic expense. There is overwhelming evidence in the medical literature that the majority of outpatient cases for which antibiotics are prescribed may be effectively and safely treated without the use of these agents. We present algorithms for upper respiratory tract infections to aid physicians and advanced practice clinicians in distinguishing those patients who may benefit from antibiotics from the greater majority who are more likely to be harmed by them.
