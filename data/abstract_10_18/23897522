BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to know the rate of prevalence of community acquired UTI infections in both males and females, Assam, North-East India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 50 mul of urine sample from each of the subjects was streaked on cystine lactose electrolyte-deficient agar medium. The plates were incubated overnight at 37 degrees C. Pure, isolated colonies of each type was separately cultured and characterized. The susceptibility of the clinical isolates to routinely prescribed antibiotics in the hospital was performed against various antibiotics. RESULTS: Of the total 40 patients, 26 positive samples were obtained of which 19 females (73.07%) and 7 male (26.92%) patients were shown to be urine culture positive. The most commonly isolated bacterium was Escherichia coli with a frequency rate of (33.3%) followed by Staphyloccous aureus (22.2%), Klebsiella pnemoniae (11.1%), coagulase negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) (7.4%), Pseudomonas sp. (7.4%), Proteus myxofaciens (3.7%), Proteus mirabilis (3.7%), Edwardsiella tarda (3.7%), Morganella morganii (3.7%), and Citrobacter fruendii (3.7%). Analysis of the samples showed that UTI was more common in females of younger age group as compared with males. It was also observed that the patients responded effectively to imepenem (IE), cepefime, amikacin, norfloxacin, and co-trimoxazole antimicrobial agents against Gram-negative bacilli. Furthermore, the most effective antibiotics against Gram-positive cocci was found to be ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, IE, and penicillin G (benzyl penicillin). CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotics have been in use for a long period and more often the misuse of antimicrobial drugs has today led to a general rise in the emergence of resistant bacteria.
