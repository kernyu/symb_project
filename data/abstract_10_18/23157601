INTRODUCTION: A combination of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) is necessary to achieve sustained virologic suppression of HIV viral load (< 50 copies/mL). Rilpivirine (RPV) is a potent new non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) that has the potential to be part of effective ARV combinations. Here, we review currently available data on RPV from the standpoint of virologic suppression and efficacy, drug-drug interactions safety, and resistance. AREAS COVERED: This review presents data on the results of clinical trials involving RPV. The topics considered include antiviral potency, dosing, clinical utility, drug resistance, toxicity profile, and pharmacokinetics. EXPERT OPINION: RPV is a potent new addition to the antiretroviral family of drugs for use in combination therapy in previously untreated HIV-infected patients. However, caution needs to be exercised in administration of RPV to patients who initiated therapy with viral loads > 100,000 viral RNA copies/mL.
