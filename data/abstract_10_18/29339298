A prospective audit and feedback antimicrobial stewardship intervention conducted in the Orthopaedics Department of a University Hospital in Portugal was evaluated by comparing an interrupted time series in an intervention group and a non-intervention (control) group. Monthly antibiotic use (except cefazolin) was measured as World Health Organization- and Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical-defined daily doses (DDD) from January 2012 to September 2016, excluding the 6-month phase of intervention implementation starting on January 1, 2015. Compared with the control group, the intervention group had in a monthly decrease in the use of fluoroquinolone by 2.3 DDD/1,000 patient-days (95% CI: -3.97 to -0.63). An increase in the use of penicillins by 103.3 DDD/1,000 patient-days (95% CI: 47.42 to 159.10) was associated with intervention implementation, followed by a decrease during the intervention period (slope = -5.2; 95% CI: -8.56 to -1.82). In the challenging scenario of treatment of osteoarticular and prosthetic joint infections, an audit and feedback intervention reduced antibiotic exposure and spectrum.
