Plasmid-mediated transfer of drug-resistance genes among various bacterial species is considered one of the most important mechanisms for the spread of multidrug resistance. To gain insights into the evolution of gene organization and antimicrobial resistance in clinical bacterial samples, a complete plasmid genome of Klebsiella pneumoniae pKF3-140 is determined, which has a circular chromosome of 147,416bp in length. Among the 203 predicted genes, 142 have function assignment and about 50 appear to be involved in plasmid replication, maintenance, conjugative transfer, iron acquisition and transport, and drug resistance. Extensive comparative genomic analyses revealed that pKF3-140 exhibits a rather low sequence similarity and structural conservation with other reported K. pneumoniae plasmids. In contrast, the overall organization of pKF3-140 is highly similar to Escherichia coli plasmids p1ESCUM and pUTI89, which indicates the possibility that K. pneumoniae pKF3-140 may have a potential origin in E. coli. Meanwhile, interestingly, several drug resistant genes show high similarity to the plasmid pU302L in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium U302 strain G8430 and the plasmid pK245 in K. pneumoniae. This mosaic pattern of sequence similarities suggests that pKF3-140 might have arisen from E. coli and acquired the resistance genes from a variety of enteric bacteria and underscores the importance of a further understanding of horizontal gene transfer among enteric bacteria.
