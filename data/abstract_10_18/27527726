INTRODUCTION: Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing bacteria are among the highly antimicrobial resistant gram negative bacteria and infections due to them are an increasingly major health problem worldwide. METHODS: In this study we have detected the blaKPC and blaGES carbapenemase genes in Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from hospitalized patients in Kashan, Iran. In a cross-sectional study, a total of 181 K. pneumoniae isolates were recovered from clinical specimens during November 2013 to October 2014. RESULT: Antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were determined using disk diffusion method according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) and CLSI guidelines. Carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates were identified. PCR method and sequencing were used for detection of blaKPC and blaGES carbapenemase genes. Of the 181 K. pneumoniae isolates, 35 (19.3%) were found to be resistant to imipenem and 150 (82.9%) were identified as MDR strains. Among carbapenems, the most resistant rate 39 (21.5%) was seen against ertapenem using disk diffusion method. Of K. pneumoniae isolates 21 (11.6%) and 42 (23.2%) carried blaKPC and blaGES genes, respectively and 19(10.5%) carried both genes simultaneously. CONCLUSION: The data of current study revealed that the frequency of resistance to carbapenems and production of carbapenemase enzymes especially GES type was high among clinical isolates of K pneumoniae in Kashan, Iran.
