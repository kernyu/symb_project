PURPOSE: Switch to unboosted atazanavir (ATV) is an attractive option due to convenience and tolerability in HIV-positive patients. With limited available data we investigated the determinants of long-term efficacy and the consequences of virological failure of unboosted atazanavir-based regimens. METHODS: Retrospective analysis in two Italian large outpatient clinics including demographic, immunovirological, resistance and pharmacokinetic data. RESULTS: 249 patients receiving atazanavir (400 mg once-daily) plus 2 NRTIs were included; 163 were males (65.5%) and median age was 47 years (42-51.5). Median CD4+ T-cell count was 396/uL (261-583); 146 (58.6%) presented a viral load < 50 copies/mL. Over a median follow up of 157 weeks (106-203) 193 patients (77.5%) were still on treatment with 10 (4%) and 2 (0.8%) stopping for virological failure or toxicity, respectively. Ten patients with virological failure presented newly selected resistance associated mutations (RAMs) for NRTIs (2/10) or ATV (4/10, one I50L). Total cholesterol and triglycerides showed significant decreases at 48 [-4 mg/dL and -41 mg/dL] and 96 weeks [-14 mg/dL and -54 mg/dL] as compared to baseline. At multivariate analysis a genotypic sensitivity score </= 1, atazanavir RAMs > 1 and suboptimal adherence were independently associated with virological failure; in lamivudine/emtricitabine-treated patients the presence of M184V (without other NRTI RAMs) was not associated with virological failure. CONCLUSION: Unboosted-atazanavir containing regimens were efficacious (with uncommon virological failures) and well-tolerated (with improvements in lipid profile over time) treatments in HIV-positive patients. Isolated M184V in lamivudine/emtricitabine recipients was not associated with higher failure rates supporting the use of functional ATV-based dual therapies as maintenance strategies.
