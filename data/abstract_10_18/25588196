The infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms are associated with increased mortality. The real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, which enables detection of ESBLs directly from patients' clinical material, was developed. This study focused on blaCTX-M and blaSHV determination in endotracheal aspirates. Each sample was identified with standard microbiological procedures and simultaneously analyzed for the presence of nucleic acids, which encode CTX-M and SHV ESBL enzymes using real-time PCR. A total of 341 samples were investigated. In the set, 27 ESBL-positive samples were identified by phenotypic methods, while 60 positive samples were identified by the PCR method. Of the 60 PCR-positive samples, 58 were positive for the blaCTX-M. In two samples, the ESBL blaSHV-ESBL gene was detected. One phenotypically positive sample was PCR negative. The real-time PCR assay does not require a cultivation step and therefore enables detection of ESBL in 6 hours. The rapid method is necessary for early and adequate antimicrobial treatment.
