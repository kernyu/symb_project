Population analysis was performed for 42 Escherichia coli isolates to determine whether heterogeneity of resistance was a factor in piperacillin-tazobactam category differences between agar dilution and broth microdilution. Of 20 isolates discordant between methods, 80% were heterogeneous. Of 22 isolates in agreement, 59% were homogeneous. Heterogeneity and homogeneity rates for those in agreement were significantly different from those that were discordant (P value, 0.010). Heterogeneity of resistance expression appears to be an important factor in category differences observed between broth microdilution and agar dilution for piperacillin-tazobactam.
