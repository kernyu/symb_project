AIM: Study the spectrum of resistance to antibiotics and its variability of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC), persisting in lungs of MV patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 312 strains of S. aureus, 213 strains of P. aeruginosa, 186 strains of BCC were studied. Monitoring of antibiotics sensitivity was carried out in strains, isolated from 30 patients with chronic S. aureus infection, from 22 patients with chronic BCC infection and from 21 patients with chronic pseudomonas infection. Interval of monitoring was from 14 days to 5 years 7 months. RESULTS: Study of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and BCC strains has shown, that 35 and 33.3% of cases of staphylococcus infection, 37 and 46% of pseudomonas infection in children and adults, respectively, 100% of BCC infections were determined by multi-resistant clones. Study of genotypically identical strains, isolated from a single patient at different stages, has shown a change in antibiotics sensitivity as a result of persistence. CONCLUSION: Persisent infection of lungs in patients with MV is determined: by exchanging clones with varying antibiotics sensitivity or prolonged circulation of a single clone with a high degree of phenotypical and genotypical variability, that determine alteration of seeding of sensitive and resistant strains from the same patient during monitoring. This confirms the necessity of study of antibiotics sensitivity of strains for prescription of antibacterial therapy.
