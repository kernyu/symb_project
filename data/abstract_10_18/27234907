The occurrence of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in livestock is considered as a threat for public health. In Germany, VIM-1-producing Escherichia (E.) coli sequence type (ST) 88 and Salmonella Infantis isolates harbouring blaVIM-1IncHI2 plasmids have been isolated from swine and poultry farms. A retrospective study was performed to determine if there was a broader distribution of VIM-1-positive isolates in any of the carbapenemase-positive swine farms. Selective incubation (carbapenem-containing broth) of 249 conserved cultures collected in three farms (2011-2012), allowed the detection of 40 blaVIM-1-positive isolates. Apart from the already known non-motile Salmonella Infantis isolate R25 (farm S1) and R27 (S2), a third isolate was recovered from farm S3. For E. coli, additional to isolates R29 and R178 (S2), 35 new isolates were identified in the same farm during all the sampling periods (three dates, 2011) and in samples from different animals, farm environment, manure and flies. The newly identified E. coli and Salmonella isolates showed similar genetic and phenotypic characteristics (XbaI-PFGE profiles, antimicrobial resistance patterns, plasmid content, phylogroups, antigenic formula) to those in the previously described strains, suggesting microevolution within the clonal lines within one fattening period. The study shows that persistence of carbapenemase-producing clonal lines in livestock farms is possible, and underlines the need for harmonised monitoring and surveillance studies to follow up the occurrence of such bacteria in European livestock.
