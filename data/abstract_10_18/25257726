Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae has disseminated rapidly in China. We aimed to analyze the molecular epidemiology of four KPC-producing K. pneumoniae strains isolated from a suspected clonal outbreak during a 3-month period and to track the dissemination of KPC-producing K. pneumonia retrospectively. We created antimicrobial susceptibility profiles using an automated broth microdilution system and broth microdilution methods. We screened carbapenemase and KPC phenotypes using the modified Hodge test and meropenem-boronic acid (BA) disk test, respectively. We identified beta-lactamase genes with PCR and sequencing. We investigated clonal relatedness for epidemiological comparison using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). All isolates expressed multidrug resistance and yielded positive results for the modified Hodge and meropenem-BA disk tests. The isolates all carried blaKPC -2 , and coproduced CTX-M-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. PFGE and MLST showed that the isolates were clonally related. The PFGE patterns of these isolates had >/=90% similarity. We found a single clone, sequence type (ST) 11, and its typical dissemination mode resembled clonal spread. The dissemination of KPC-producing K. pneumoniae is clonally related and there is probable local transmission of a successful ST11 clone.
