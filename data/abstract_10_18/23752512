The present work reports the detection of the first case of nosocomial Klebsiella oxytoca producing class A carbapenemase KPC-2 in Brazil. The isolate KPN106 carried a 65-kb IncW-type plasmid that harbors the blaKPC gene and Tn4401b. Moreover, we detected the presence of a class 1 integron containing a new allele, arr-8, followed by a 5'-truncated dhfrIIIc gene. In view of the recent results, we emphasize the high variability of the bacterial and genetic hosts of this resistance determinant.
