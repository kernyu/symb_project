This study aimed to identify risk factors for intestinal colonization with multidrug-resistant (MDR) E. coli in dogs on admission to a veterinary teaching hospital. Exposures to potential risk factors, including prior treatments, hospitalizations and interventions during the 42 days prior to admission were assessed for 82 case admissions and 82 time-matched controls in a retrospective prevalence-based case-control study of 20 months duration. On multivariable analyses, risk of MDR E. coli colonization on admission was increased with prior hospitalization for 4-7 days and >7 days relative to shorter periods, and in dogs that had prior diagnostic imaging techniques. Univariable analyses indicated that risk was increased following prior treatment with several antimicrobial agents. However, on multivariable analysis, administration of fluoroquinolones was associated with increased risk but risk did not appear to increase following administration of other antimicrobials. These results can inform management of canine patients and infection control procedures to mitigate the risk of clinical disease due to MDR bacteria in hospitalized dogs.
