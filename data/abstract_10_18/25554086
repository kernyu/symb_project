Previous studies of cationic p-phenylene ethynylenes oligomers (OPEs) have revealed strong antimicrobial activity and strong photophysical changes upon their aggregation that can be utilized for sensing various chemicals and biomolecules. In this article, the adsorption of two types of OPEs with different placement of charged groups onto the synthetic clay Laponite is studied, and the changes to photophysical properties, photochemical degradation efficiency, and biocidal effectiveness are determined. In addition to solution-phase studies, the material and biocidal properties of solid films formed from the OPE-Laponite complex were assessed. The results of this study suggest that OPEs aggregate on Laponite and induce aggregation between Laponite discs, leading to drastic changes to their photophysical and material properties. Solid OPE-Laponite films were shown to have fair resistance to dissolution in aqueous solution compared with Laponite alone, and adhesion and minor killing of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria on the surface was observed. The results of this study give insight into controlling the colloidal phases of Laponite via molecular aggregation, may be useful for development of sensors and biocides involving Laponite as a scaffold, and lead to further control over slow-release and surface interactions of biocidal materials.
