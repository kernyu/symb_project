The in vitro susceptibilities of 140 laboratory reference strains of fungi, including type strains, and 165 clinical yeast isolates from Japan towards isavuconazole compared with fluconazole (FLC), itraconazole (ITC), voriconazole and amphotericin B were measured. Broth microdilution methods based on Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) methods were used for yeasts, and RPMI-MOPS medium semi-solidified with 0.2% low-melting-point agarose based on CLSI guidelines was used for moulds. The range of isavuconazole minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) was 0.0004-0.21 mg/L for Candida albicans, 0.0036-0.4 mg/L for Candida glabrata, 0.023-0.058 mg/L for Candida krusei, 0.0026-0.032 mg/L for Cryptococcus neoformans, 0.1-0.39mg/L for Aspergillus fumigatus and 0.2-0.39 mg/L for Aspergillus terreus. Isavuconazole was as active as ITC against the dimorphic true pathogenic fungi, with a range of MICs from <0.0004 mg/L to 0.0063 mg/L for Blastomyces dermatitidis and Histoplasma capsulatum. It was also active against uncommon dematiaceous fungi such as Exophiala spp. and Phialophora spp. as well as against dermatophytic species. Isavuconazole showed very good in vitro antifungal activity with a broad spectrum, including against FLC-resistant Candida spp., Aspergillus spp. and uncommon opportunistic fungal species. This is the first report of the in vitro susceptibility of Japanese clinical yeast isolates to isavuconazole. No cross-resistance was found to isavuconazole amongst FLC-resistant strains.
