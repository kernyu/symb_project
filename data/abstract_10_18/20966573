The present study was carried out to determine the rates of high-level and low-level mupirocin resistance in Staphylococcus spp. (MuH and MuL) in southern India. A prospective study was carried out on Staphylococcus spp. isolated for a period of three months in the microbiology laboratory of an 800-bedded tertiary care hospital. One hundred sixty-seven non-duplicate Staphylococcus spp. isolated from different specimens were tested for mupirocin susceptibility using 5 and 200 mug discs and by agar dilution. Rates of MuH were found to be two percent in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and 28% in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (MRCoNS). MuL strains may be still treated with mupirocin, while MuH strains require other treatment options for eradication, making prior screening and differentiation important.
