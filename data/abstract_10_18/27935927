INTRODUCTION: Infections caused by Gram negative bacteria, producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, including Klebsiella pneumoniae are increasing all over the world with high morbidity and mortality. The aim of the present study was determined antimicrobial profile susceptibility and the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes by multiplex PCR. METHODS: In the present study, we obtained one-hundred isolates of K. pneumoniae from different clinical samples. The antibiotic susceptibility testing was done in thirteen antibiotic and, therefore, M-PCRs were conducted using the DNA amplification for detection of ESBLs (blaTEM, blaCTX-M, blaSHV) and int (I, II, III) genes. RESULTS: The results of resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanate, ciprofloxacin, amikacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cefotaxime, ampicillin, aztreonam, imipenem, gentamicin, ceftazidime, Cefepime, ceftriaxone and levofloxacin were obtained 37%, 37%, 93%, 84%, 52%, 87%, 59%, 8%, 24%, 67%, 52%, 43% and 26%, respectively. The frequency of the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase K. pneumoniae was obtained 37%. The prevalence of resistance genes of ESBLs in the M-PCR method showed that the blaTEM, blaCTX and blaSHV were 38%, 24% and 19%, respectively, however, only 8 (8%) out of 100 isolates were found to have positive outcomes for the existence of class 1 integrons and there were no detected class 2 or class 3 integrons. CONCLUSIONS: Our results recommend the likely co-carriage of some ESBLs genes and antibiotic resistance integrons on the same plasmids harboring the MDR genes.
