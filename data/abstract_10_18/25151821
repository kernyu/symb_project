Our work aimed at a global investigation of the lipid metabolism during the induction of resistance in wheat (Triticum aestivum) against powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici). More specifically, the effect of salicylic acid, known as playing a key role in the activation of defence reactions against pathogens in plants, has been investigated. After salicylic acid infiltration, accumulation of phosphatidic acid was observed that could be due to the phospholipase C pathway since an up-regulation of a phospholipase C-encoding gene expression as well as an accumulation of diacylglycerol were observed. The phosphatidic acid accumulation could also result from the phospholipase D pathway since a reduction of phosphatidylethanolamine content occurred. The response to salicylic acid at the octadecanoid pathway level was also investigated: both a lipoxygenase-encoding gene expression and lipoxygenase enzymatic activity were induced by salicylic acid simultaneously with a decrease of the linolenic acid content. Finally, a lipid transfer protein-encoding gene expression was also up-regulated upon salicylic acid infiltration. These observations indicate that lipid metabolism could be considered as a marker of elicitation in wheat.
