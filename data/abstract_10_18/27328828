Cutaneous granulomas caused by Candida guilliermondii are difficult to cure. In situ photoimmunotherapy (ISPI) is a novel method composed of local photothermal therapy and immunoadjuvant. In this study, ISPI was used the first time clinically for cutaneous granuloma caused by itraconazole-resistant C.guilliermondii. A 10-week cycle of ISPI was composed of (1) 5% imiquimod applied topically every other day and (2) irradiation of lesions with an 808-nm diode laser at Days 14, 28, 42, and 56. Here we report our first case. A patient was treated with ISPI for four cycles. After the treatment, the lesions were eliminated without recurrence during a 12-month follow-up. Our results demonstrate that ISPI can be used as an effective treatment modality for cutaneous fungal granuloma.
