Overexpression of the efflux pump AdeABC is associated with tigecycline resistance of multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAB). A two-component regulatory system, sensor AdeS and regulator AdeR proteins regulate the pump. However, the detailed mechanism of the AdeR protein to enhance the expression of adeABC operon is not well defined. We illustrated the biological characteristics of AdeR proteins by comparing a mutant AdeR protein of a tigecycline resistant MDRAB to the wild AdeR protein. By analyzing a series of deletion constructs, a minimal gene cassette of the intercistronic spacer DNA fragment specifically bound with the adeR protein and resulted in band shifting in electrophoresis mobility shifting assays (EMSA). A conserve direct repeat motif was observed in the intercistronic spacer DNA. We demonstrated the AdeR protein was a direct-repeat-binding protein. Two common residue mutations on the AdeR proteins of tigecycline resistant MDRAB isolates could reduce their binding affinity with the intercistronic spacer. The free intercistronic spacer may then more efficiently support the read-through of the adeABC operon during the co-transcriptional translation in tigecycline resistant MDRAB isolates.
