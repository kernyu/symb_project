The resistome of the multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli strain 271 carrying the plasmid-mediated bla(NDM-1) carbapenemase gene was analyzed by high-throughput genome sequencing. The p271A plasmid carrying the bla(NDM-1) gene was 35.9 kb in size and possessed an IncN-type backbone that harbored a novel replicase gene. Acquisition of the bla(NDM-1) gene on plasmid p271A had been likely the result of a cointegration event involving the transposase of Tn5403. The expression of bla(NDM-1) was associated with the insertion sequence ISAba125 likely originating from Acinetobacter baumannii. E. coli 271 accumulated multiple resistance determinants, including five beta-lactamase genes (comprising the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase CTX-M-15), two 16S RNA methylase ArmA- and RmtB-encoding genes, and the qepA gene encoding an efflux pump involved in resistance to fluoroquinolones. These resistance genes were located on three additional plasmids, of 160 kb (IncA/C), 130 kb (IncF), and 110 kb (IncI1). In addition, several chromosomally encoded resistance determinants were identified, such as topoisomerase mutations, porin modifications and truncations, and the intrinsic ampC gene of E. coli that was weakly expressed. The multidrug resistance pattern observed for E. coli 271 was therefore the result of combined chromosome- and plasmid-encoded mechanisms.
