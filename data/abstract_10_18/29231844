Biofilm formation plays a critical role in antimicrobial resistance in Staphylococcus aureus. Here, we investigated the potential of crude extracts of 79 Micronesian marine microorganisms to inhibit S. aureus biofilm formation. An extract of Streptomyces sp. MC025 inhibited S. aureus biofilm formation. Bioactivity-guided isolation led to the isolation of a series of 2,2'-bipyridines: collismycin B (1), collismycin C (2), SF2738 D (3), SF2738 F (4), pyrisulfoxin A (5), and pyrisulfoxin B (6). Among these bipyridines, collismycin C (2) was found to be the most effective inhibitor of biofilm formation by methicillin-sensitive S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and this compound inhibited MRSA biofilm formation by more than 90% at a concentration of 50 mug/mL. The antibiofilm activity of collismycin C was speculated to be related to iron acquisition and the presence and position of the hydroxyl group of 2,2'-bipyridines.
