The postoperative peritonitis (POP) remains formidable conditions due to a high mortality rate of between 20 and 80%. The purpose of this study is to identify risk factors for mortality. This study is a retrospective, descriptive analysis carried out over a period of 09 years (1/1/2003 - 30/11/2011) and interesting 102 patients supported for POP following general surgery. Achieved in department of General Surgery B Charles Nicolle hospital Tunis. The parameters measured included epidemiological data, data related to the Initial Surgical Intervention and reoperation for POP, terms of management and evolution. Bacteriological data were also seized. The incidence of POP was 0.90%. The average age of our patients was 58 +/- 19 years with a sex ratio of 1.08. Forty-seven percent of our patients belonged to the ASAII class. The initial operation was performed urgently in 49 patients (48%) with a majority belonging to the class II Altemeier (49.01%). Colorectal pathology (373%) and hepatobiliay (176%) were the most frequent reasons for the initial intervention. The frequency of clinical signs were fever (75.5%), hypothermia (6.9%), abdominal pain (725%), abdominal distension (46.1%), productive gastric aspiration (30.4%), abdominal defense (25.5%), externalizing the digestive fluid (25.5%), vomiting (19.6%), diarrhea (12.7%), tachycardia (569%), oliguria (42.2%), respiratory failure (40.2%), hypotension (35.3%), neuropsychiatric disorders ( 23.5%) and jaundice (69%). The treatment period was 2.95 +/- 3.16 days. The surgical recovery time was 78 days +/- 5.66. At the time of reoperation, the APACHE II score was 8.43 +/- 6.26 and 25.1 +/- MPI score 8.53. The POP was generalized in 52.9% of cases with purulent peritoneal fluid in 51% of cases. The most common cause was the dropping of the anastomosis (59.8%). Empirical antibiotic therapy was appropriate in 69.44 % of cases. The mortality rate was 39.2%. Multivariate analysis using multiple logistic regression identified the following factors as independent mortality factors: Age > or = 60 years (RR = 6.089), multiple organ failure (RR = 18.019), non-appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy (RR = 6.541), stercoral aspect of peritoneal fluid (RR 6.412). Despite a low frequency, the POP are burdened with a high mortality rate. The improved prognosis requires early diagnosis in order to allow a appropriate load medicosurgical support before the installation of multiorgan failure syndrome. Among the independent factors associated with mortality that we have identifed, the not adapted empiric antibiotic therapy is the main factor on which we can act.
