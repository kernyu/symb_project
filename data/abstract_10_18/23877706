Faldaprevir (BI 201335) is a selective NS3/4A protease inhibitor under development for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. NS3/4A genotyping and NS3 protease phenotyping analyses were performed to monitor the emergence of resistance in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection receiving faldaprevir alone or combined with pegylated interferon alfa 2a and ribavirin (PegIFN-RBV) during a phase 1b study. Among all baseline variants, a maximum 7-fold reduction in in vitro sensitivity to faldaprevir was observed for a rare NS3 (V/I)170T polymorphism. During faldaprevir monotherapy in treatment-naive patients, virologic breakthrough was common (77%, 20/26) and was associated with the emergence of resistance mutations predominantly carrying NS3 substitutions R155K in GT1a and D168V in GT1b. D168V conferred a greater reduction in faldaprevir sensitivity (1,800-fold) than R155K (330-fold); however, D168V was generally less fit than R155K in the absence of selective drug pressure. Treatment-experienced patients treated with faldaprevir-PegIFN-RBV triple therapy showed higher viral load reductions, lower rates of breakthrough (8%, 5/62), and less frequent emergence of resistance-associated variants compared with faldaprevir monotherapy.
