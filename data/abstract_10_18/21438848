Antimicrobial resistance is a major health problem worldwide, but marked variations in the resistance profiles of bacterial pathogens are found between countries and in different patient settings. In Tunisia, the strikingly high prevalence of resistance of bacteria to penicillins and cephalorosporins drugs including fourth generation in clinical isolates of Gram negative bacteria has been reported. During 30 years, the emerging problem of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates is substantial, and some unique enzymes have been found. Recently, evidence that Gram-negative bacteria are resistant to nearly all available antimicrobial agents, including carbapenems, have emerged.
