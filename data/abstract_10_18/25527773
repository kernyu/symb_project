Angiopoietin like-2 (angptl2) is a circulating pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidative protein, but its role in regulating cerebral endothelial function remains unknown. We hypothesized that in mice knockdown (KD) of angptl2, cerebral endothelial function would be protected against ANG II-induced damage. Subcutaneous infusion of ANG II (200 ng.kg(-1).min(-1), n = 15) or saline (n = 15) was performed in 20-wk-old angptl2 KD mice and wild-type (WT) littermates for 14 days. In saline-treated KD and WT mice, the amplitude and the sensitivity of ACh-induced dilations of isolated cerebral arteries were similar. However, while endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS)-derived O2 (-)/H2O2 contributed to dilation in WT mice, eNOS-derived NO (P < 0.05) was involved in KD mice. ANG II induced cerebral endothelial dysfunction only in WT mice (P < 0.05), which was reversed (P < 0.05) by either N-acetyl-l-cysteine, apocynin, gp91ds-tat, or indomethacin, suggesting the contribution of reactive oxygen species from Nox2 and Cox-derived contractile factors. In KD mice treated with ANG II, endothelial function was preserved, likely via Nox-derived H2O2, sensitive to apocynin and PEG-catalase (P < 0.05), but not to gp91ds-tat. In the aorta, relaxation similarly and essentially depended on NO; endothelial function was maintained after ANG II infusion in all groups, but apocynin significantly reduced aortic relaxation in KD mice (P < 0.05). Protein expression levels of Nox1/2 in cerebral arteries were similar among all groups, but that of Nox4 was greater (P < 0.05) in saline-treated KD mice. In conclusion, knockdown of angptl2 may be protective against ANG II-induced cerebral endothelial dysfunction; it favors the production of NO, likely increasing endothelial cell resistance to stress, and permits the expression of an alternative vasodilatory Nox pathway.
