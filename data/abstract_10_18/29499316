Avibactam is a novel beta-lactamase inhibitor active against classes A, C and some class D beta-lactamases. In combination with ceftazidime, it may be useful for the treatment of infections due to carbapenemase-producing Gram negative (CPGN) bacteria from these classes; however, susceptibility data for some of the less-common carbapenemases are limited. To assess the in vitro activity of ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA), we tested a panel of fifty diverse CPGN collected from clinical isolates in Victoria, Australia, containing KPC, GES, SME, OXA-23 and OXA-48-like carbapenemases for CZA susceptibility using broth microdilution (BMD), E-tests and disc diffusion. All isolates were CZA susceptible. E-tests correlated well with BMD, although MICs were generally lower than BMD. Disc diffusion correlated moderately well with BMD, with two interpretive errors. Our study confirms phenotypic CZA susceptibility in the carbapenemase groups tested, including the less-common OXA-23-producing E. coli, SME-producing Serratia marcescens and GES-5-producing P. aeruginosa.
