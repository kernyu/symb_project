The role of biofilms in the environment and in the hosts of pathogenic bacteria has recently attracted much attention of researchers. Microorganisms form biofilms at any biotic and abiotic surfaces and thereby cause serious problems in medical practice and other areas of human activity. Biofilms have been shown to be pathogenetic factors responsible for chronization of infectious process. The data are presented illustrating ubiquitous nature of biofilms, their structural and functional characteristics, and modern methods for the study of microbial communities. The discussion is focused on the role of biofilms in chronization of infectious process, enhanced resistance of biofilm organisms to antibiotics and its underlying mechanisms. Approaches to the search for new means for biofilm control during chronic infections are considered.
