Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the worst form of primary brain tumor, which has a high rate of infiltration and resistance to radiation and chemotherapy, resulting in poor prognosis for patients. Recent studies show that thiazolidinones have a wide range of pharmacological properties including antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-tumor. Here, we investigate the effect antiglioma in vitro of a panel of sixteen synthetic 2-aryl-3-((piperidin-1-yl)ethyl)thiazolidin-4-ones where 13 of these decreased the viability of glioma cells 30-65% (100 muM) compared with controls. The most promising compounds such as 4d, 4l, 4m and 4p promoted glioma reduction of viability greater than 50%, were further tested at lower concentrations (12.5, 25, 50 and 100 muM). Also, the data showed that the compounds 4d, 4l, 4m and 4p induced cell death primarily through necrosis and late apoptosis mechanisms. Interestingly, none of these 2-aryl-3-((piperidin-1-yl)ethyl)thiazolidin-4-ones were cytotoxic for primary astrocytes, which were used as a non-transformed cell model, indicating selectivity. Our results also show that the treatment with sub-therapeutic doses of 2-aryl-3-((piperidin-1-yl)ethyl)thiazolidin-4-ones (4d, 4l and 4p) reduced in vivo glioma growth as well as malignant characteristics of implanted tumors such as intratumoral hemorrhage and peripheral pseudopalisading. Importantly, 2-aryl-3-((piperidin-1-yl)ethyl)thiazolidin-4-ones treatment did not induce mortality or peripheral damage to animals. Finally, 2-aryl-3-((piperidin-1-yl)ethyl)thiazolidin-4-ones also changed the nitric oxide metabolism which may be associated with reduced growth and malignity characteristics of gliomas. These data indicates for the first time the therapeutic potential of synthetic 2-aryl-3-((piperidin-1-yl)ethyl)thiazolidin-4-ones to GBM treatment.
