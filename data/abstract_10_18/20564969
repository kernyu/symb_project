The aim of the study was retrospective analysis of Salmonella spp. strains isolated from patients of State Infectious Diseases Observatory Hospital of T. Browicz in Bydgoszcz (SZAK) and University of dr. A. Jurasz in Bydgoszcz (SU CM UMK) in 2006-2009. The percentages of Salmonella spp. strains resistant to at least one drug were: 19,0% in 2006, 12,5% in 2007, 50,6% in 2008 and 43,8% in the first half of 2009 year. The highest number of Salmonella spp. strains resistant to drugs were isolated from stool (96,7%) and from patients of SZAK (83,3%). Among all isolated Salmonella spp. strains resistant to drugs the highest percentage were S. enterica serovar Enteritidis (56,7%). Among S. enterica bacilli predominated resitant phenotypes to ampicillin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol and nalidixic acid. The increasing number of strains resistant to ciprofloxacin (0,0 - 26,7%) and high percentage of strains resistant to nalidixic acid (97,3%) were noted. Decreasing resistance to chloramphenicol was observed in our study (54,5 - 14,3%).
