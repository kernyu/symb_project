The fear that schistosomes will become resistant to praziquantel (PZQ) motivates the search for alternatives to treat schistosomiasis. Recent studies of signaling proteins in schistosomes uncovered a way of achieving this goal relatively quickly. It was shown that protein kinases (PKs) control important biological processes in schistosomes. Concurrently, the involvement of mutant forms of PKs was demonstrated in the etiology of cancer. Therefore, different anticancer drugs have been developed to inhibit deregulated PKs. These can also inhibit schistosome PKs, thus blocking parasite development. Recent studies characterizing schistosome PKs are summarized and we discuss the concept of PK inhibitors, including approved cancer drugs, as novel candidate anti-schistosome agents. This is also likely to be of significance for other worm infections.
