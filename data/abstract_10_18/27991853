BACKGROUND/AIMS: Helicobacter pylori is a carcinogenic bacterium that could induce P-glycoprotein expression in the human gastrointestinal tract. Bacterial adherence to the gastrointestinal cell lines could be influenced by the level of P-glycoprotein. This study aimed to determine the influence of proton pump inhibitors that exhibit an inhibitory effect on P-glycoprotein in gastrointestinal carcinoma cell lines, namely Caco-2 and LS174T, in relation to H. pylori adherence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Caco-2 and LS174T cells lines treated with omeprazole and esomeprazole were used in this study to assess the bacterial attachment of H. pylori within certain incubation periods. RESULTS: The presence of proton pump inhibitors increased the H. pylori adherence in a time-dependent manner in both Caco-2 and LS174T cell lines. The double inhibition of P-glycoprotein using proton pump inhibitor and P-glycoprotein inhibitor caused low P-glycoprotein expression in the cell lines, resulting in higher H. pylori adherence compared to the control cell lines. CONCLUSION: Proton pump inhibitors may alter P-glycoprotein expression in the gastrointestinal tract, and subsequently H. pylori adherence on the cell lines, and may contribute to resistance to drug therapy.
