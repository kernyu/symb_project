Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the main cause of mortality in cystic fibrosis patients and eradication of its biofilm represents a substantial problem clinically. In this study, biofilm of a cystic fibrosis strain P. aeruginosa PACI22 was established and confocal laser scanning microscopy was utilized for biofilm visualization. A quantitative time-kill biofilm model was implemented in vitro to assess the biocidal effect of ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, and their combination at concentration levels ranged from 0.5x to 64x minimum biofilm inhibitory concentrations (MBIC) against the biofilm and the mean log bacterial densities (Log CFU/ml) retrieved from the biofilm were monitored by frequent sampling at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 hr throughout the experiment. The results revealed that none of the tested antibiotics alone could completely eradicate the biofilm-ensconced bacteria at 0.5-64x MBIC values after 24 hr of treatment. Conversely, ciprofloxacin-clarithromycin combination at 32-64x MBIC entirely exterminated the biofilm. Furthermore, a substantial in vitro synergism between ciprofloxacin and clarithromycin against the biofilm was experimentally verified. This promising synergism affords scientific rationale for further in vivo investigations to evaluate the therapeutic potential of this combination for treatment of chronic pulmonary infections caused by P. aeruginosa biofilms.
