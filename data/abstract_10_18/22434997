BACKGROUND: Sever acute malnutrition severely suppresses every component of the immune system leading to increased susceptibility and severity to infection. However, symptoms and signs of infections are often unapparent making prompt clinical diagnosis and early treatment very difficult. The aim of the study was to determine the magnitude of bacteraemia and antimicrobial sensitivity among severely malnourished children. METHODS: Severely malnourished children admitted in Jimma University Specialized Hospital were enrolled between October, 2009 to May, 2010. Blood samples were collected, processed and bacterial isolates were identified using standard bacteriological procedures. Then, antibiotic susceptibility pattern of the isolates was determined by using Kirby-Bauer technique. RESULTS: Bacteraemia was seen in 35 (20.6%) of the 170 study subjects. There were a total of 35 bacterial isolates, Gram positive bacteria constitute 24(68.6%) of the isolates, where Staphylococcus aureus was the leading Gram positive isolate while Klebsiella species were the dominant Gram negative isolates. Twelve (7.1%) children died and 4 (33.3%) of them had bacteraemia. While susceptibility was more than 80% to Gentamicin, Ciprofloxacin and Ceftriaxone, increased level of resistance was documented to commonly used antibiotics, such as Amoxycillin, Co-trimoxazole and Chloramphenicol. CONCLUSION: High prevalence of bacteraemia with predominating Gram positive isolates and increased level of resistance to commonly used antibiotics was shown among severely malnourished children in Jimma. Further studies are required to revise the current guideline for antibiotic choice.
