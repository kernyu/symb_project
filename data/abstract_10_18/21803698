Antibiotic resistance in probiotic strains is a matter of interest due to the increase in consumption of probiotic products. Many studies have evaluated the antibiotic susceptibility of lactobacilli or the presence of resistance determinants, while knowledge on selection of resistance during exposure to antibiotics is still limited. Our aim was to evaluate the behavior of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG ATCC 53103, a well-known probiotic microorganism, during exposure to erythromycin, tetracycline, amoxicillin/ clavulanate and ciprofloxacin. Our study demonstrated that prolonged exposure to erythromycin and ciprofloxacin could select mutants with reduced susceptibility, even if these modifications in susceptibility could not be attributed to known antibiotic resistance genes or genetic mutations.
