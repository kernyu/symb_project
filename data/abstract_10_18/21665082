Multidrug resistance is defined as a resistance to two major antituberculosis drugs, which are isoniazid and rifampicin. The aim of the study was to specify the place of the thoracic surgery during the medical follow-up of the TB-MDR. Five files were kept over six years during this retrospective study. On the clinical and radiological level, localised lesions and a negative HIV serology were noted in the five patients. The completion date of the surgery varied between the third month and the 22nd after the beginning of the medical treatment. This delay in carrying out the surgery was encouraged by the social conditions of the patients. Three series of expectoration culture post-surgery were all negative. After surgery, the medical treatment was drawn out over six and 12 months depending on the clinical condition of the patient. No recurrence was observed. Only one patient died one year after the surgery from hemoptysis in relation to pulmonary sequelae.
