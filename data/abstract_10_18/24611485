Nitric oxide (NO), a gaseous, redox-active small molecule, is gradually becoming established as a central regulator of growth, development, immunity and environmental interactions in plants. A major route for the transfer of NO bioactivity is S-nitrosylation, the covalent attachment of an NO moiety to a protein cysteine thiol to form an S-nitrosothiol (SNO). This chemical transformation is rapidly emerging as a prototypic, redox-based post-translational modification integral to the life of plants. Here we review the myriad roles of NO and SNOs in plant biology and, where known, the molecular mechanisms underpining their activity.
