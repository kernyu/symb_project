In France, Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhimurium and Derby are the most often isolated serotypes in pigs. Moreover, serotype Derby usually ranks between third and fourth in prevalence among human isolates in France. The aim of this study was to evaluate the genetic relationships between human and pig Salmonella Derby isolates based on their pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns after XbaI, BlnI, and SpeI restriction and on their antimicrobial resistance profiles. The 196 studied isolates were isolated in 2006 and 2007: 73 from fattening pigs, 27 from pork, and 96 from humans. Forty-four PFGE XbaI patterns were identified. A major pattern (SDX01) was identified for 96 isolates (49%). This pattern was common to pig, pork, and human isolates. Among the 146 isolates tested for their antimicrobial resistance, 84.2% (n=123) showed resistance to at least one antibiotic and 69.2% (n=101) were simultaneously resistant to at least streptomycin, sulfonamides, and tetracycline. Most of the isolates that are resistant to these three antibiotics also displayed the major SDX01 pattern. The use of two other restriction enzymes on a part of the panel (155 isolates) brought a significant increase in the discriminatory index, in particular for SDX01 strains. As Salmonella Derby is essentially isolated from pigs, and major resistance and PFGE patterns of isolates from pigs and pork were very similar to human isolates, human salmonellosis due to Salmonella Derby may be related to pigs.
