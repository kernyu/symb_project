BACKGROUND: Management of patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis is highly complicated because of the longer treatment time, lesser effectiveness of second-line antituberculosis drugs, more side-effects, and a significant financial burden on tuberculosis control programs. This study aimed to identify predictors of drug-resistant tuberculosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: It was a case-control record study conducted in an antituberculosis center in a government hospital in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. Cases were pulmonary tuberculosis patients with antituberculosis drug resistance (n=80), and controls were pulmonary tuberculosis patients without drug resistance (n=101). Data were collected from patients' records during the period from January 2008 to February 2013. RESULTS: Male sex [odds ratio (OR)=5.764; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.024-16.421], smoking (OR=4.605; 95% CI 1.864-11.378), and positive Acid Fast Bacilli smear on admission (OR=40.149; 95% CI 9.010-178.914) were the risk factors for developing drug resistance (P<0.05 for each) in the sample. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Positive AFB smear on admission, male sex, and smoking are risk factors for developing drug-resistant TB. These predictors should be used to formulate a health policy to monitor tuberculosis patients so as to prevent drug resistance.
