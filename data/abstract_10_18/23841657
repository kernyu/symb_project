Listeria monocytogenes is an important foodborne pathogen of public health concern. A total of 902 retail food samples, including 342 ready-to-eat (RTE) foods, 366 infant foods, and 194 raw chickens were collected randomly in supermarkets and farmers' markets in 12 geographic areas in Shaanxi Province, China and screened for L. monocytogenes. All L. monocytogenes isolates were characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, serotyping, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Twenty-seven (3.0%) samples were positive for L. monocytogenes, and 39 L. monocytogenes isolates were recovered from positive samples. Of these L. monocytogenes isolates, 21 isolates (53.8%) showed resistance to at least one antimicrobial. The isolates displayed resistance most frequently to oxacillin (18 isolates, 46.2%), followed by tetracycline (five isolates, 12.8%), erythromycin (four isolates, 10.3%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (three isolates, 7.7%), chloramphenicol (two isolates, 5.1%), and vancomycin (one isolate, 2.6%). All isolates were sensitive or displayed intermediate resistance to gentamicin, ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, and amikacin. Four serotypes including serotype 1/2b, 4b, 4e, and 1/2a were identified in those foodborne isolates. PFGE analysis demonstrated that some isolates with the same PFGE patterns came from different food sources, and isolates from the same food source tend to cluster closely. Presence of L. monocytogenes of clinically important serotypes in retail foods and their antimicrobial resistance constitute a potential risk for the public. Appropriate measures should be taken by government, industry, and consumers to reduce the risk posed by this ubiquitous pathogen.
