The purpose of the present study was to determine the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant enterococci in dogs and cats subjected to differing antibiotic pressures, and the prevalence of vancomycin resistance genes in isolates from these animals. Enterococci were isolated from fecal samples of 65 healthy dogs and 29 healthy cats brought to animal hospitals, from rectal swabs of 73 puppies and 15 kittens from five breeders and two pet shops, and from fecal samples of 20 dogs and 9 cats that were treated with antibiotics in Nippon Veterinary and Life Science University Animal Medical Center. The rates of resistance to ampicillin among isolates from the kitten-puppy group and healthy dog-cat group were 6.8 and 4.3%, respectively. In contrast, the rates of resistance to ampicillin in enterococci from the treatment group under antibiotic pressure were 37.5%. There was a significant difference between the antibiotic-treated group and the untreated group (P<0.01). Similarly, in the treatment group, the rate of resistance to enrofloxacin was extremely high (75.0%). In comparison, in the healthy group and kitten-puppy group, the rates of resistance to enrofloxacin were 23.4 and 12.1%, respectively. Among these groups, a significant difference was also observed in the apparent resistance rates (P<0.01). Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) harboring vanA or vanB were not detected in any groups. Therefore, contamination of VRE in dogs and cats is still considered to be minimal in Japan.
