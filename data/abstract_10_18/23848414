BACKGROUND: There is still wide variability in surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis (SAP) practice by different surgical teams and specialties, with potential impact on adverse events and the emergence of antibiotic resistance. METHODS: We assessed SAP appropriateness in a regional prospective multicenter study on the basis of the agreement of the Surgical Care Improvement Project indicators (SCIP-Inf) with Italian guidelines (GL). RESULTS: Prophylaxis was administered in 2,664 of 2,835 procedures (94%): In 2,346 of 2,468 (95%) as indicated and in 318 of 367 (86.6%) in which they were not indicated. The SCIP-Inf1 (timing), SCIP-Inf2 (antibiotic choice), and SCIP-Inf3 (duration) were in agreement with GL in 1,172 (50%), 1,983 (84.5%), and 1,121 (48%) of 2,346 procedures, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest the need for implementation of an antimicrobial stewardship program in this surgical setting.
