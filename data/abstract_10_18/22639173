Nosocomial outbreaks of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae are an increasing concern in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). We describe an outbreak of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae that lasted 5 months and affected 23 neonates in our NICU. Proton pump inhibitor and extended-spectrum cephalosporin exposure were significantly associated with the risk of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae colonisation and/or infection. Thirty isolates recovered from clinical, screening and environmental samples in the NICU were studied by means of Raman spectroscopy, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and repetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction (rep-PCR). The Raman clustering was in good agreement with the results of the other two molecular methods. Fourteen isolates belonged to the Raman clone 1 and 16 to the Raman clone 3. Molecular analysis showed that all the strains expressed SHV-1 chromosomal resistance, plasmid-encoded TEM-1 and CTX-M-15 beta-lactamases. Incompatibility groups of plasmid content identified by PCR-based replicon typing indicated that resistance dissemination was due to the clonal spread of K. pneumoniae and horizontal CTX-M-15 gene transfer between the two clones.
