We have recently characterized the central components of the three MAP kinase cascades present in Cryphonectria parasitica : the MEK genes cpkk1, cpkk2 and cpkk3. When we attempted to infect through anastomosis the three knock out strains with Cryphonectria hypovirus 1 (CHV1), only the deletion strain of Cpkk2, the yeast Ste7 homologue, involved in mating and filamentous growth, could not be infected. We then proceeded to attempt virus infection through transformation of Deltacpkk2 protoplasts using an infectious cDNA clone able to establish virus infection through transformation. In this case, a very limited number of strains could be recovered as stable transformants compared to the efficiency of control transformations with plasmid carrying only the antibiotic marker. Furthermore, transformants carrying actively replicating virus could be isolated only if the selection marker Geneticin was used during the very initial selection process, and not maintained throughout the growth of the colonies. Moreover, Deltacpkk2 isolates that maintained the virus lost Geneticin resistance. We therefore unveiled a specific negative interaction among virus infection, presence of Geneticin in the growth media, and lack of Cpkk2 MEK in the fungal host.
