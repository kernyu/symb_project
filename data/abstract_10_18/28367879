Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC), an enteric pathogen, causes persistent diarrhea in children, HIV-infected individuals, and travelers in economically developing countries. However, the pathogenesis of EAEC infection is not well understood. This study aimed to characterize EAEC in Japan. Between 2012 and 2014, we identified 40 EAEC strains carrying the aggR gene at the Kawasaki City Institute for Public Health, Japan. We characterized these strains using O:H-antigen typing, polymerase chain reaction (for pCVD432, astA, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, and 4 aggregative adherence fimbriae genes), HEp-2 cell adherence, clump formation, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. We were able to classify the 40 EAEC strains into 20 O:H types. Although specific O:H types were not correlated with HEp-2 cell aggregative adherence, all the O99:H10, O131:H27, and O176:H34 EAEC strains that were the most frequent O:H types detected in this study showed co-resistance to ampicillin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and tetracycline. Based on results of the adhesion assay and detection of virulence-related genes, no significant difference was found between asymptomatic and symptomatic cases. Irrespective of the origin, their potential for virulence was retained. Further characterization is vital to determine whether EAEC is virulent in Japan.
