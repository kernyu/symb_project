AIM: (+)-Catechin and puerarin are polyphenol and flavonoid, respectively, in green tea and foodstuffs. They exhibit potent antioxidant activity and are widely used for treating cardiocerebrovascular diseases. The aim of this work was to investigate the potential interactions between (+)-catechin and puerarin following concurrent oral administration in rats, and their absorption mechanisms in Caco-2 cell monolayers. METHODS: Pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in male rats received (+)-catechin (140 mg/kg, po) and/or puerarin (200 mg/kg, po). The cell uptake and transport behavior in Caco-2 cell monolayers and the interactions of the two compounds were analyzed. RESULTS: When (+)-catechin and puerarin were administered concurrently, the AUC0-12 h and Cmax values of puerarin were 2.48-fold and 3.91-fold, respectively, as large as those of puerarin alone; the AUC0-12 h and Cmax values of (+)-catechin were decreased to 57.62% and 77.55%, respectively, compared with those of (+)-catechin alone. In Caco-2 cell monolayers, (+)-catechin (300 and 600 mumol/L) significantly increased the cell uptake and transport of puerarin, whereas puerarin (300 and 600 mumol/L) significantly decreased the cellular uptake and transport of (+)-catechin. Furthermore, both cyclosporine A (P-glycoprotein inhibitor) and MK-571 (MRP-2 inhibitor) significantly increased the cellular uptake and transport of (+)-catechin and puerarin. CONCLUSION: Concurrent oral administration of (+)-catechin and puerarin significantly increased the absolute oral bioavailability of puerarin, but decreasing that of (+)-catechin. The competitive efflux of (+)-catechin and puerarin by P-glycoprotein and MRP-2 might lead to this interaction during their absorption process in the small intestine.
