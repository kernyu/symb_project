Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) belonging to the TEM and SHV families were investigated in 583 ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae collected at the clinical microbiology laboratories of 11 teaching Italian hospitals. By molecular analysis TEM-type and SHV-type ESBLs were confirmed on 154 and 74 isolates, respectively. High variability was found among TEM-types beta-lactamases with the following variants: TEM-5, TEM-6, TEM-12, TEM-15, TEM-24, TEM-26, TEM-29, TEM-52, TEM-92, TEM-134, and TEM-149. Among SHV variants, SHV-2a, SHV-5, SHV-12, and SHV-28 have been detected. The most widespread variants are TEM-52/92 and SHV-12.
