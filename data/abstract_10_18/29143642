BACKGROUND: The emergence of macrocyclic lactone resistance in canine heartworm poses a substantial threat to what is currently the only effective, FDA-approved available method of prevention. Further study of the biotypes is necessary to understand the mechanism of resistance and evaluate novel prevention options. Identifying cases of drug-resistant infection remains problematic, however, especially when poor compliance and insufficient testing are concerns. Furthermore, a definitive demonstration of resistance requires experimental infection and treatment, which is prohibitively costly. METHODS: With the aim of identifying likely cases of macrocyclic lactone-resistant heartworm and preventing their continued spread, we describe an algorithm for determining the likelihood of drug resistance and appropriate treatment strategies for each case. RESULTS: This algorithm relies on the microfilarial suppression test (MFST), which has been used previously as an efficient and discrete measure of suspected resistance. By standardizing this method in a format that is readily available to practitioners, it could become possible to preliminarily survey the emergence and spread of resistance. CONCLUSION: Heartworm isolates identified through this method can be used in research to better understand macrocyclic lactone resistance so prevention strategies can be adapted.
