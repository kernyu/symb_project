Cynanchum komarovii Al Iljinski is a desert plant that has been used as analgesic, anthelminthic, and antidiarrheal, but also as herbal medicine to treat cholecystitis in people. In this work, an antifungal protein with sequence homology to chitinase was isolated from C. komarovii seeds and named CkChn134. The three-dimensional structure prediction of CkChn134 indicated that the protein has a loop domain formed a thin cleft, which is able to bind molecules and substrates. The protein and CkTLP synergistically inhibited the fungal growth of Verticillium dahliae, Fusarium oxysporum, Rhizoctonia solani, Botrytis cinerea, and Valsa mali in vitro. The full-length cDNA was cloned by RT-PCR and RACE-PCR according to the partial protein sequences obtained by nanoESI-MS/MS. The real-time PCR showed that the transcription level of CkChn134 had a significant increase under the stress of ethylene, NaCl, low temperature, drought, and pathogen infection, which indicates that CkChn134 may play an important role in response to abiotic and biotic stresses. The CkChn134 protein was located in the extracellular space/cell wall by CkChn134::GFP fusion protein in transgenic Arabidopsis. Furthermore, overexpression of CkChn134 significantly enhanced the resistance of transgenic Arabidopsis against V. dahliae. Interestingly, the coexpression of CkChn134 and CkTLP showed substantially greater protection against the fungal pathogen V. dahliae than either transgene alone. The results suggest that the CkChn134 is a good candidate protein or gene, and it had a potential synergistic effect with CkTLP for contributing to the development of disease-resistant crops.
