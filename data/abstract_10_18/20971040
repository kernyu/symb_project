Antimalarial drug therapies containing artemisinins, 'ACTs', have become the mainstay for treating uncomplicated malaria in endemic countries. This is a major public health achievement requiring substantial political, financial and scientific input. The most compelling scientific argument for ACT deployment employed a very simple basic rationale that emphasised their role in slowing the origin of drug resistance while largely neglecting the additional role(s) of ACTs in slowing or preventing the spread of resistance once it has arisen. Recent reports suggest that early stages of resistance to artemisinins and/or its partner drugs could be occurring, thus it is timely to briefly review exactly how ACTs slow the origin and spread of resistance and to interpret the threat of resistance within this context.
