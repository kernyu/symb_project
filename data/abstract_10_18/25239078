BACKGROUND & AIMS: Chronic hepatitis C treatment for prior non-responders to peginterferon (PegIFN)/ribavirin remains suboptimal. The MATTERHORN study evaluated regimens containing ritonavir-boosted danoprevir (danoprevir/r) in prior PegIFN alfa/ribavirin non-responders. METHODS: Prior partial responders (N=152) were randomized to 24 weeks of twice-daily danoprevir/r 100/100mg, mericitabine 1000 mg and ribavirin 1000/1200 mg (IFN-free); danoprevir/r plus PegIFN alfa-2a/ribavirin (triple); or danoprevir/r, mericitabine and PegIFN alfa-2a/ribavirin (Quad). Prior null responders (N=229) were randomized to 24 weeks of IFN-free therapy, or quad alone (Quad 24) or quad plus 24-weeks of PegIFN alfa-2a/ribavirin (Quad 48). The primary endpoint was sustained virological response (HCV RNA <25 IU/ml) 24 weeks after end-of-treatment (SVR24). Due to high relapse rates, genotype (G) 1a patients in IFN-free arms were offered additional PegIFN alfa-2a/ribavirin. RESULTS: Among prior partial responders, SVR24 rates were 46.2%, 51.0%, and 86.0%, in the IFN-free, Triple and Quad arms, respectively; among prior null responders, SVR24 rates were 45.5%, 80.5%, and 83.8% respectively. Relapse rates were lower and SVR24 rates higher in G1b-infected than G1a-infected patients. SVR24 rates in G1a and G1b patients randomized to Quad were 75.0% and 96.2%, respectively, in the partial Quad arm, and 68.1% and 100%, respectively, in the null Quad 24 arm. Treatment failure was associated with resistance to danoprevir, but not to mericitabine, and was more common in G1a infected patients. Treatment was well-tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Danoprevir/r, mericitabine plus PegIFN alfa-2a/ribavirin was well-tolerated and produced high overall SVR24 rates in prior partial and null responders to PegIFN alfa/ribavirin. In contrast, IFN-free regimens were associated with unacceptably high relapse rates.
