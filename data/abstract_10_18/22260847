INTRODUCTION: Since it was first described in the 1990s, Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection among people with no contact with a hospital setting or with no traditional risk factors, has spread worldwide and is now an important epidemiological and public health problem. METHODS: The present prospective and observational study was carried out from April to November 2010. All adult patients with community-acquired suppurative skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) attending the Emergency Department were enrolled. Clinical, microbiological and epidemiological features of the infection were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 59 samples were collected from 59 patients and CA-MRSA was isolated in 13 of them. Prevalence of CA-MRSA in patients with suppurative SSTI seen in the emergency department was 22.03%, and was 33.3% in patients with staphylococcal infection. Is worth noting the greater presence of necrosis detected in CA-MRSA lesions. Only 3 patients required hospital admission. Eleven of the 13 strains were Panton-Valentine leucocidin producers, and 5 were resistant to non-betalactam antibiotics. CA MRSA infection is still more frequent in the immigrant population. CONCLUSION: Data on CA-MRSA prevalence in Spain are sparse. This study aims to emphasise the current importance of this emergent pathogen in our area. About one third of suppurative staphylococcal SSTI presenting in our emergency department are caused by this agent, confirming a rapid spread in our country. Some clinical features, such as the high presence of necrosis, are closely related to CA-MRSA.
