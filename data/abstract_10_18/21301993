Prion protein (PrP) is a ubiquitous conserved glycoprotein predominantly expressed in neurons of the central nervous system (CNS). To elucidate on its cellular function, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen within an adult human brain cDNA library for potential PrP-binding molecules. A novel protein, HS-1 associated protein X-1 (HAX-1), was identified to be able to bind with PrP strongly. The interaction between the two proteins has been further verified by glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down and immunoprecipitation assays. The minimal binding regions were mapped to the segments of residues aa 91-163 for PrP(C) and residues aa 38-129 for HAX-1. Immunofluorescent assays of co-expressions of human PrP and HAX-1 in 293T and SHSY-5Y cells revealed marked co-localizations of those two proteins in cytoplasm. Moreover, the co-expression of HAX-1 and wild-type PrP (PG5) was found to enhance the cellular resistance to the challenge of H(2)O(2). Contrarily, co-transfection of HAX-1 did not reverse but aggravated the cytotoxicities of the genetic CJD (gCJD) associated PrP mutants with nine- (PG9) and fourteen-octarepeats (PG14). Our data provide for the first time a new PrP-interacting partner that may play role in cell oxidative stress and anti-apoptosis physiologically and cell damage pathologically.
