A main problem in oncology is the development of drug-resistance. Some plant-derived lignans are established in cancer therapy, e.g. the semisynthetic epipodophyllotoxins etoposide and teniposide. Their activity is, unfortunately, hampered by the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) efflux transporter, P-glycoprotein. Here, we investigated the bisphenolic honokiol derived from Magnolia officinalis. P-glycoprotein-overexpressing CEM/ADR5000 cells were not cross-resistant to honokiol, but MDA-MB-231 BRCP cells transfected with another ABC-transporter, BCRP, revealed 3-fold resistance. Further drug resistance mechanisms analyzed study was the tumor suppressor TP53 and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). HCT116 p53(-/-) did not reveal resistance to honokiol, and EGFR-transfected U87.MG EGFR cells were collateral sensitive compared to wild-type cells (degree of resistance: 0.34). To gain insight into possible modes of collateral sensitivity, we performed in silico molecular docking studies of honokiol to EGFR and EGFR-related downstream signal proteins. Honokiol bound with comparable binding energies to EGFR (-7.30 +/- 0.01 kcal/mol) as the control drugs erlotinib (-7.50 +/- 0.30 kcal/mol) and gefitinib (-8.30 +/- 0.10 kcal/mol). Similar binding affinities of AKT, MEK1, MEK2, STAT3 and mTOR were calculated for honokiol (range from -9.0 +/- 0.01 to 7.40 +/- 0.01 kcal/mol) compared to corresponding control inhibitor compounds for these signal transducers. This indicates that collateral sensitivity of EGFR-transfectant cells towards honokiol may be due to binding to EGFR and downstream signal transducers. COMPARE and hierarchical cluster analyses of microarray-based transcriptomic mRNA expression data of 59 tumor cell lines revealed a specific gene expression profile predicting sensitivity or resistance towards honokiol.
