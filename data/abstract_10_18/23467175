BACKGROUND: Transmitted resistant HIV may revert to wild-type in the absence of drug pressure due to reduced replication capacity (RC). We observed eight therapy-naive patients infected with HIV harbouring four mutations at nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) resistance-related positions: M41L, T69S, L210E and T215S. If partial reverted resistance patterns like these are detected at baseline, concerns for more extensive resistance in the quasispecies often directs selection of first-line combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) towards more complex regimens. METHODS: Genotypic resistance testing and phylogenetic analysis was performed using pol sequences of 400 therapy-naive patients and 1322 patients with at least one NRTI-related mutation. Reverse transcriptase (RT) genes were cloned into a reference strain and RC was investigated. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis showed that all eight patients are part of a transmission cluster (bootstrap value 92%). The patients resided in three distinct geographical regions and were either homosexually or heterosexually infected. Prior negative serology and analysis of base ambiguity demonstrated circulation for at least 7 years. In vivo evolution showed a mixture with wild-type (T215S/T) in only one untreated patient more than 6 years after diagnosis. The reverted resistance pattern did not confer a substantial reduction in RC compared with wild-type, explaining its persistence in vivo and long-term circulation in the population. Four patients started cART; three of them received quadruple cART. All patients showed good virological and immunological response. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term circulation transcending distinct regions and transmission groups suggests reversion occurred in previous hosts in the transmission chain. Identification of clusters using epidemiological data and active-partner tracing may broaden therapeutic options in cases of transmitted resistance.
