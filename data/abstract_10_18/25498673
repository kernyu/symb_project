It was the aim of this study to investigate the effect of unmodified as well as thiolated anionic poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and cationic chitosan (CS) utilized in free-soluble form and as nanoparticulate system on the absorption of the hydrophilic compound FD4 across intestinal epithelial cell layer with and without a mucus layer. Modifications of these polymers were achieved by conjugation with cysteine to PAA (PAA-Cys) and thioglycolic acid to CS (CS-TGA). Particles were prepared via ionic gelation and characterized based on their amount of thiol groups, particle size and zeta potential. Effects on the cell layer concerning absorption enhancement, transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and cytotoxicity were investigated. Permeation enhancement was evaluated with respect to in vitro transport of FD4 across Caco-2 cells, while mucoadhesion was indirectly examined in terms of adsorption behaviour when cells were covered with a mucus layer. Lyophilized particles displayed around 1000 mumol/g of free thiol groups, particle sizes of less than 300 nm and a zeta potential of 18 mV (CS-TGA) and -14 mV (PAA-Cys). Cytotoxicity studies confirmed that all polymer samples were used at nontoxic concentrations (0.5% m/v). Permeation studies revealed that all thiolated formulations had pronounced effects on the paracellular permeability of mucus-free Caco-2 layers and enhanced the permeation of FD4 3.0- to 5.3-fold. Moreover, polymers administered as particles showed a higher permeation enhancement than their corresponding solutions. However, the absorption-enhancing effect of each thiolated formulation was significantly (p<0.05) reduced when cells were covered with mucus layer. In addition, all formulations were able to decrease the TEER of the cell layer significantly (p<0.05). Therefore, both thiolated polymers as nanoparticulate delivery systems represent a promising tool for the oral administration of hydrophilic macromolecules.
