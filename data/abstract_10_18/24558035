beta-Lactams are mainstream antibiotics that are indicated for the prophylaxis and treatment of bacterial infections. The AcrA-AcrD-TolC multidrug efflux system confers much stronger resistance on Escherichia coli to clinically relevant anionic beta-lactam antibiotics than the homologous AcrA-AcrB-TolC system. Using an extensive combination of chimeric analysis and site-directed mutagenesis, we searched for residues that determine the difference in beta-lactam specificity between AcrB and AcrD. We identified three crucial residues at the "proximal" (or access) substrate binding pocket. The simultaneous replacement of these residues in AcrB by those in AcrD (Q569R, I626R, and E673G) transferred the beta-lactam specificity of AcrD to AcrB. Our findings indicate for the first time that the difference in beta-lactam specificity between AcrB and AcrD relates to interactions of the antibiotic with residues in the proximal binding pocket.
