CpsB is a metal ion-dependent hydrolase involved in the biosynthesis of capsular polysaccharides in bacterial organisms. The enzyme has been proposed as a promising target for novel chemotherapeutics to combat antibiotic resistance. The crystal structure of CpsB indicated the presence of as many as three closely spaced metal ions, modelled as Mn(2+), in the active site. While the preferred metal ion composition in vivo is obscure Mn(2+) and Co(2+) have been demonstrated to be most effective in reconstituting activity. Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) we have demonstrated that, in contrast to the crystal structure, only two Mn(2+) or Co(2+) ions bind to a monomer of CpsB. This observation is in agreement with magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) data that indicate the presence of two weakly ferromagnetically coupled Co(2+) ions in the active site of catalytically active CpsB. While CpsB is known to be a phosphoesterase we have also been able to demonstrate that this enzyme is efficient in hydrolyzing the beta-lactam substrate nitrocefin. Steady-state and stopped-flow kinetics measurements further indicated that phosphoesters and nitrocefin undergo catalysis in a conserved manner with a metal ion-bridging hydroxide acting as a nucleophile. Thus, the combined physicochemical studies demonstrate that CpsB is a novel member of the dinuclear metallohydrolase family.
