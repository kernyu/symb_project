The global fight to stop tuberculosis (TB) remains a great challenge, particularly with the increase in drug-resistant strains and a lack of funding to support the development of new treatments. To bolster a precarious drug pipeline, we prepared a focused panel of eight pentafluorosulfanyl (SF5 ) compounds which were screened for their activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) H37Rv in three different assay conditions and media. All eight compounds had sub-micromolar potency, and four displayed MICs <100 nm. Seven compounds were evaluated against non-replicating and mono-drug-resistant Mtb, and for their ability to inhibit Mtb within the macrophage. The greatest potency was observed against intracellular Mtb (MIC <10 nm for three compounds), which is often the most challenging to target. In general, the SF5 -bearing compounds were very similar to their CF3 counterparts, with the major differences observed being their in vitro ADME properties. Two SF5 -bearing compounds were found to have greater protein binding than their corresponding CF3 counterparts, but were also less metabolized in human microsomes, resulting in longer half-lives.
