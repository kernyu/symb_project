Burkholderia sp. infections are extremely complex in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, especially considering the lack of knowledge regarding its behavior, its relationship with prognosis, as well as its transmissibility and multidrug resistance features. This study evaluated the frequency of chronic infection by Burkholderia, using microbiological and clinical data. Ninety-eight patients with CF attended from July 2011 to April 2014 in a Brazilian reference hospital were included. Antimicrobial activity, molecular epidemiology, Shwachman score, body mass index, exacerbations, and lung function were analyzed. Nine patients had chronic colonization, and all of them showed preserved pulmonary function levels, body mass index, and Shwachman score. Meropenem was the most effective antibiotic; however, divergent results were shown by other studies. Cross-contamination may have occurred in only two unrelated patients of different ages, who were colonized by B. vietnamiensis, which does not occur frequently. Twelve new sequence types (STs) were identified and three STs have presented intercontinental distribution. None of the patients presented known epidemic strains. In conclusion, a relatively low number of patients with chronic colonization and suspected cross-infection were identified. Different from other studies that have found CF patients chronically colonized with Burkholderia sp. having a greater deterioration of lung function, more frequent antibiotic therapy, and increased mortality, in the current study, the patients showed good clinical outcomes and favorable options for antibiotics therapy. This study also updated the epidemiological database, which facilitates the multicentric collaborative analysis and assists in the control of global infection by these pathogens.
