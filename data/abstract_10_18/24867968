Efinaconazole is a novel triazole antifungal drug for the topical treatment of onychomycosis, a nail infection caused mainly by dermatophytes. We assessed the potential of efinaconazole to induce resistance in dermatophytes by continuous exposure of Trichophyton rubrum strains to efinaconazole in vitro (12 passages) and in a guinea pig onychomycosis model (8 weeks). There was no evidence of efinaconazole resistance development in the tested strains under the experimental conditions used.
