Emerging drug resistance has forced the scientific community to revisit the observational data documented in the folklore and come up with novel and effective alternatives. Candidates from eukaryotic origin including herbal products and antimicrobial peptides are finding a strategic place in the therapeutic armamentarium against infectious diseases. These agents have recently gained interest owing to their versatile applications. Present review encompasses the use of these alternative strategies in their native or designer form, alone or in conjunction with antibiotics, as possible remedial measures. Further to this, the limitations or the possible concerns associated with these options are also discussed at length.
