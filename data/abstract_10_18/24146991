BACKGROUND: Anti-tuberculosis drug resistance continues to be a major obstacle to tuberculosis (TB) control programmes with HIV being a major risk factor in developing TB. We investigated anti-TB drug resistance profiles and the impact of socioeconomic as well as behavioural factors on the prevalence of TB and drug resistance in two regions of Cameroon with such data paucity. METHODS: This was a hospital-based study in which 1706 participants, comprising 1133 females and 573 males consecutively enrolled from selected TB and HIV treatment centres of the Northwest and Southwest regions. Demographic, clinical and self-reported risk behaviours and socioeconomic data were obtained with the consent of participants using questionnaires. Culture and drug resistance testing were performed according to standard procedures. RESULTS: The prevalence of resistance to at least one anti-TB drug was 27.7% and multi-drug resistance was 5.9%. Smoking, concurrent alcohol consumption and smoking, being on antiretroviral therapy for </= 12 months and previous household contact with TB patient were independently associated with tuberculosis prevalence, while only previous tuberculosis infection was associated with drug resistance in a univariate analysis. CONCLUSION: The study showed a high prevalence of drug resistance TB in the study population with only previous TB infection associated with drug resistance in a univariate analysis. It also provides evidence in our context, of the role of alcohol and smoking in increasing the risk of developing TB, which is more likely in people living with HIV/AIDS. Therefore, it is important for public health authorities to integrate and intensify alcohol/smoking abstention interventions in TB and HIV control programs in Cameroon.
