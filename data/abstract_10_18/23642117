TB is still a major global health problem causing over 1 million deaths per year. An increasing problem of drug resistance in the causative agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, as well as problems with the current lengthy and complex treatment regimens, lends urgency to the need to develop new antitubercular agents. Proteases have been targeted for therapy in other infections, most notably these have been successful as antiviral agents in the treatment of HIV infection. M. tuberculosis has a number of proteases with good potential as novel drug targets and developing drugs against these should result in agents that are effective against drug-resistant and drug-sensitive strains. In this review, the authors summarize the current status of proteases with potential as drug targets in this pathogen, particularly focusing on proteases involved in protein secretion (signal peptidases LepB and LspA), protein degradation and turnover (ClpP and the proteasome) and virulence (mycosins and HtrA).
