OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk factors for respiratory intensive care unit (RICU)-acquired colonization of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR-AB). METHODS: From January 2010 to June 2011, active screening was performed to define patients with RICU-acquired colonization of MDR-AB. And environment surveillance was carried out and patient data were collected. Logistic regression was applied to identify the risk factors of RICU-acquired colonization of MDR-AB. RESULTS: Active screening for MDR-AB was performed for 110 patients in RICU and 50 patients turned out to be positive. After eliminating 3 input positive patients, the RICU-acquired colonization rate of MDR-AB was 43.9% (47/107). The environmental contaminated rate of MDR-AB was 66.0% (31/47) for 47 positive patients and 33.9% (19/56) for 56 negative ones (chi(2) = 10.494, P < 0.01). Five risk factors were associated with the colonization of MDR-AB through univariate analysis: consciousness disturbance, use of carbapenems, nasal feeding tube, endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation (all P < 0.05). The Logistic regression equation contained 3 risk factors of conscious disturbance, use of carbapenems and mechanical ventilation (OR = 3.412, 3.211, 3.002; 95% CI: 1.165 - 9.992, 1.117 - 9.233, 1.101 - 8.182). CONCLUSION: Three risk factors are independently associated with the RICU-acquired colonization of MDR-AB: consciousness disturbance, use of carbapenems and mechanical ventilation.
