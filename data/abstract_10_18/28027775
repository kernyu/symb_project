Oxidation of alpha-euphorbol and 31-norlanostenol, two triterpenic compounds isolated from the latex of Euphorbia resinifera and Euphorbia officinarum respectively, yielded four products named 3beta-tosyloxy-4alpha,14alpha-dimethyl-5alpha-cholesta-7,9-diene; 4alpha,14alpha-dimethyl-5alpha-cholesta-7,9-dien-3beta-ol; 24-methylen-elemo-lanosta-8,24-dien-3-one and elemo-lanost-8-en-3,11,24-trione. They were evaluated for protection of tomato plants against Verticillium dahliae in a greenhouse. The four semisynthesized products were phytotoxic at higher concentrations as they completely inhibited tomato germination at 100 and 500 mug/ml. However at lower concentrations (10 and 50 mug/ml) germination and root length were not affected. Disease resistance against Verticillium wilt was assessed in tomato plants derived from seeds that germinated in the presence of 10 and 50 mug/ml of the four products. All of them were able to reduce significantly disease severity, with 10 mug/ml being more effective than 50 mug/ml. Reduction of leaf alteration index and of stunting index ranged from 52 to 68% and from 43 to 67%, respectively, while vessel discoloration was reduced by at least 95%. The compounds were also able to elicit H2O2 accumulation before and after fungal inoculation and to significantly enhance peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase activities. These results suggest that the hemisynthetized triterpenes can be used as elicitors of disease resistance.
