Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important nosocomial pathogen also found in water, soil, plants and in human and animal fecal samples. In this study, 31 isolates from water samples were analyzed by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-polymerase chain reaction (ERIC-PCR) and PCR to detect integrons and investigated for antibiotic resistance and plasmidial profile. The results demonstrated the presence of plasmids in four isolates. Three of these, isolates from water in a city park (Curupira Park, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil) and a lake at the University of Sao Paulo (Campus of Ribeirao Preto), had plasmids with the same molecular weight (21MDa) and similar resistance profiles, although they were shown to be genetically different by ERIC-PCR. Class 1 and class 2 integrons were detected in one of these isolates. The results suggest that environmental P. aeruginosa strains may be a potential reservoir of plasmids and antibiotic resistance genes.
