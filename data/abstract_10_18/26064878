The genotypes and oxacillin resistance of 420 S. aureus isolates from pigs (n = 203) and pork (n = 217) were analyzed. Among 18 spa types detected in S. aureus from pig t011, t021, t034, t091, t318, t337, and t1334 were the most frequent. Among 30 spa types found in S. aureus isolates from pork t084, t091, t499, t4309, t12954, and t13074 were dominant. The animal S. aureus isolates were clustered into MLST clonal complexes CC7, CC9, CC15, CC30, and CC398 and meat-derived isolates to CC1, CC7, and CC15. Thirty-six MRSA were isolated exclusively from pigs. All MRSA were classified to spa t011 SCCmecV. BORSA phenotype was found in 14% S. aureus isolates from pigs and 10% isolates from pork meat. spa t034 dominated among BORSA from pigs and t091 among meat-derived BORSA. This is the first report on spa types and oxacillin resistance of S. aureus strains from pigs and pork meat in Poland. Besides S. aureus CC9, CC30, and CC398 known to be distributed in pigs, the occurrence of genotype belonging to CC7 in this species has been reported for the first time. To our knowledge it is also the first report concerning CC398 BORSA isolates from pigs and pork meat.
