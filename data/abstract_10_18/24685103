The sustainability of sheep production is hindered by anthelmintic resistance. Options to slow down or prevent resistance have been widely studied but their application in the field is still limited. In this study, the practical application and effect of a targeted selective treatment (TST) approach for the treatment of parasitic gastroenteritis was investigated in lambs (n = 385) over a 2 year period. At 14-day intervals during the grazing season, liveweight, breech soiling and anthelmintic treatments were individually recorded. Selection of lambs for anthelmintic treatment in the TST group was based on pre-calculated individual growth rates, with a matched cohort routinely treated (RT) with anthelmintic drug every 6 weeks. The adoption of a TST approach had no negative effect on the liveweight gains of the lambs, time to finishing or breech soiling measures compared to RT lambs; however a 50% decrease in anthelmintic treatment was observed in the TST group. The time to implement this system averaged 2 min per lamb. It is concluded that the TST could be suitable for commercial sheep farms, in association with automated weighing systems, potentially reducing selection for anthelmintic resistance, while having no negative effect on production.
