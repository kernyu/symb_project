Here we reported a novel protein elicitor from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens NC6 induced systemic resistance (ISR) in tobacco. The purification was executed by ion-exchange chromatography, native-page extraction and HPLC, and the amino acid sequence was identified by mass spectrometry. This recombinant elicitor protein, expressed in Escherichia coli by an E1 expression vector, had good thermal stability, and the elicitor caused a clearly defined hypersensitive response (HR) necrosis in tobacco leaves. It could also trigger early defence events, including generation of reactive oxygen species (H2O2 and O2 (-)) and phenolic-compound accumulation. Quantitative real-time PCR (Q-RT-PCR) results indicated that several plant defence genes, including the salicylic acid (SA)-responsive PR1a, PR1b, PR5, and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), as well as the jasmonic acid (JA)-responsive PDF1.2 and CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1 (COI1), were all up-regulated. Moreover, infiltration conferred systemic resistance against a broad spectrum of pathogens, including Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea.
