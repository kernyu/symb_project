Little information is available on the prevalence of drug-resistance mutations in patients harboring the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) circulating recombinant form (CRF)07_BC variant in Sichuan, China. This study examined 375 plasma samples from patients with HIV-1 who were infected with the CRF07_BC strain, including 104 drug-naive participants and 271 in whom antiretroviral therapy (ART) had failed. Only one participant in the drug-naive group had a drug-resistance mutation (M46L), compared with 31.73% of those in whom ART had failed. Further analysis showed that 19.56% of strains contained mutations conferring resistance to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) alone, 0.74% were resistant to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) alone, and 11.44% were dual-resistant to both NRTIs and NNRTIs. The most common mutation in the ART-failure group was M184V (35.88%), K103N (45.01%), Y181C (17.33%), and G190S/A (15.88%). The percentages of HIV-1 strains resistant to lamivudine, emtricitabine, efavirenz, etravirine, and nevirapine were 10.70%, 10.70%, 28.04%, 7.75%, and 26.20%, respectively. To explore site variants possibly related to drug resistance, variations in the ancestor/consensus CRF07_BC sequences from the therapy-naive and ART-failure groups were compared, and seven mutations at six positions were identified as being significantly differently distributed between the two groups (p<0.05). Detailed sequence data will provide information on CRF07_BC genetic characterizations, and improve our understanding of antiretroviral susceptibility and the evolution of drug-resistance mutations. This will be valuable in developing and implementing local public-health approaches for HIV drug-resistance prevention and treatment.
