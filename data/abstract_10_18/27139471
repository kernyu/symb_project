Synergy between colistin and the signal peptidase inhibitor MD3 was tested against isogenic mutants and clinical pairs of Acinetobacter baumannii isolates. Checkerboard assays and growth curves showed synergy against both colistin-susceptible strains (fractional inhibitory concentration index [FICindex] = 0.13 to 0.24) and colistin-resistant strains with mutations in pmrB and phosphoethanolamine modification of lipid A (FICindex = 0.14 to 0.25) but not against colistin-resistant Deltalpx strains with loss of lipopolysaccharide (FICindex = 0.75 to 1). A colistin/MD3 combination would need to be targeted to strains with specific colistin resistance mechanisms.
