The antiherpesvirus activity of newly synthesized DNA-binding compounds for cultured Vero E6 cells was examined. The compounds were found to have selective antiherpesviral activity. Their antiviral activity was shown against the virus strains isolated from clinical specimens. The test compounds were ascertained to have also a high activity against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1/L2 TC-) that was very resistant to acyclovir. The authors' data demonstrated an obvious dose-dependent antiviral effect, which was representatively seen when Pt-bis-Dst and Lys-bis-Nt were used. The findings have offered the challenge to test some of these compounds in experiments on laboratory animals.
