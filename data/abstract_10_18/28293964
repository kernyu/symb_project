INTRODUCTION: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) continues to be a predominant pathogen resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Optimal dosing of anti-MRSA agents is needed to help prevent the development of antimicrobial resistance and to increase the likelihood of a favorable clinical outcome. Areas covered: This review summarizes the available data for antimicrobials routinely used for MRSA infections that are not administered orally or topically. We make recommendations and highlight the current gaps in the literature. A PubMed (1966 - Present) search was performed to identify relevant literature for this review. Expert commentary: Improvements in MIC determination and therapeutic drug monitoring are needed to fully implement individualized dosing that optimizes antimicrobial pharmacodynamics.Additional data will become available for these agents in regards to effectiveness for severe MRSA infections and pharmacokinetic data for special patient populations.
