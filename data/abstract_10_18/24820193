Antibiotic-resistant probiotics may be advantageous for antibiotic-induced gut microbiota imbalance. In this article, we aimed to isolate antibiotic-resistant bacteria as potential probiotics. Feces from 3 healthy adults and 2 infants were used to isolate the antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Then we established gut microbiota imbalance mice model by antibiotics treatment and used it to assess the effect of the probiotics. Finally, we identified 8 isolates, and 6 of them were used as probiotics cocktail. Number of anaerobe, lactobacilli, and Bifidobacterium in feces were higher in the probiotic group (9.47+/-0.35 log10CFU/g, 8.74+/-0.18 log10CFU/g, 7.24+/-0.38 log10CFU/g, respectively) compared with model group (P<0.05). Richness and diversity index of probiotic group (19.79+/-0.29 and 2.95+/-0.06, respectively) were larger than model group (P<0.05). Diarrhea and mucosal edema had been alleviated during probiotic treatment. Our results validated that bacteriotherapy was available to treat gut microbiota imbalance.
