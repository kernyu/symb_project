UNLABELLED: Objective : The objective of the study was to observe the antimicrobial resistance of AmpC beta-lactamase producing E. coli. METHODS: Six hundred and seventy E. coli were isolated from 20,257 various pathological samples collected from The Children's Hospital and Institute of Child Health, Lahore, Pakistan. The isolates showed resistance to ceftazidime which were further examined for AmpC beta-lactamase activity by Disc Potentiation method. RESULTS: There were 670 isolates of E. coli out of which 85 (12.6%) were AmpC beta-lactamase producers. Risk factors like intravenous line (76.5%), endotracheal tube (22.4%), surgery (12.9%) and urinary catheters (7.1%) were found to be associated with infection caused by AmpC beta-lactamase producing E. coli. Antimicrobial resistance pattern revealed that AmpC producing E. coli were highly resistant to co-amoxiclav, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, cefuroxime, cefixime, ceftriaxone and cefoxitin (100% each). Least resistance was observed against sulbactam-cefoperazone (14.1%), cefepime (7.1%), piperacillin-tazobactam (5.9%) and none of the isolates were resistant to imipenem and meropenem. CONCLUSION: The minimum use of invasive devices and strict antibiotic policies can reduce the spread of AmpC beta-lactamase producing E. coli.
