OBJECTIVES: The aim of this 'split-mouth design' trial was to evaluate the effect of the nano amorphous calcium phosphate (NACP) containing composite on enamel mineral contents and streptococcus mutans population in fixed orthodontic patients. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND INTERVENTION: Randomized, prospective, single-center controlled trial. Twenty-four patients between the ages of 13-18 years participated in this study. The control and test sides were randomly selected by a coin toss (1:1 ratio). On the control side orthodontic brackets were bonded on the buccal surfaces of upper premolars and laterals using an orthodontic composite (Transbond XT), and on the study side NACP-containing composite was used. Outcome measures were the mineral content around the brackets and S.mutans count. The later were calculated in the plaque around the brackets by real-time PCR at 3 months, and 6 months after the initiation of treatment. All stages of the study were blind using coding system. Paired t-test and repeated measurements were used for data analysis. RESULTS: In the third and sixth month, the bacterial population was significantly lower in the study side than the control side (P = 0.01 and 0.000).The mineral content of the study side was significantly higher than the controls, 6 months after brocket bonding (P = 0.004). There were no significant differences between the premolars and lateral teeth for all measurements. LIMITATIONS: This research was performed in a single-center by one experienced clinician. CONCLUSION: NACP-containing composites have the potential to inhibit mineral content loss and S.mutans colonization around orthodontic brackets during fixed orthodontic treatments. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was not registered. PROTOCOL: The protocol was not published before trial commencement.
