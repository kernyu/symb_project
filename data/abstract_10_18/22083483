The efflux pump AcrAB is important in the antibiotic resistance and virulence of several pathogenic bacteria. We report that deletion of the Yersinia pestis AcrAB-TolC homolog leads to increased susceptibility to diverse substrates, including, though unlike in Escherichia coli, the aminoglycosides. Neither is the Y. pestis pump affected by the efflux pump inhibitor phenylalanine-arginine beta-naphthylamide. In mouse plague models, pump deletion does not have a significant effect on tissue colonization.
