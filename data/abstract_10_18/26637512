PURPOSE: The chemistry, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, efficacy, and safety of the recently introduced combination antimicrobial agent ceftolozane-tazobactam are reviewed. SUMMARY: Ceftolozane-tazobactam (Zerbaxa, Cubist Pharmaceuticals) is a cephalosporin beta-lactam and beta-lactamase inhibitor marketed as a fixed-dose combination agent for the treatment of complicated urinary tract and intraabdominal infections. Its dosing and chemistry provide expansive antimicrobial coverage of gram-negative organisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stable activity against many beta-lactamases, as well as coverage of most extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing organisms and some anaerobes. Ceftolozane-tazobactam is susceptible to hydrolysis by carbapenemase enzymes but is not affected by other resistance mechanisms such as efflux pumps and porin loss. Clinical trials demonstrated that combination treatment with ceftolozane-tazobactam plus metronidazole had efficacy comparable to that of levofloxacin in patients with complicated urinary tract infections, including pyelonephritis, and comparable to that of meropenem against complicated intraabdominal infections. A Phase III trial of ceftolozane-tazobactam versus meropenem for treatment of bacterial pneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, is underway. Adverse effects reported with ceftolozane-tazobactam use are comparable to those seen with other beta-lactams (e.g., hypersensitivity, nausea, diarrhea, headache). Initially, ceftolozane-tazobactam may be reserved for targeted therapy against multidrug-resistant pathogens. CONCLUSION: Ceftolozane-tazobactam is a new cephalosporin with enhanced activity against multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa and other gram-negative pathogens.
