LuxR is a widespread and functional diverse transcription factors and belongs to TetR protein superfamily. It could both activate and inhibit the expression of many genes contingent on the contexts, thereby involving in many crucial physiological events, such as virulence factors production, biofilm formation, quorum sensing (QS), acetate metabolism, motility, bioluminescence, and ecological competition. We summarized the function diversity of LuxR and underlying mechanisms. The interchangeability of some transcriptional factors for secondary metabolites biosynthesis opens new avenue to obtain new chemical entities or higher yield of antibiotics via the manipulation of regulators instead of structural genes. Inhibitors of pathogen QS are under intensive screening for better new antibiotics against the drug resistance. A compendium of compounds capable of inhibiting LuxR family transcriptional factors is also presented.
