The clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (n = 102) were analyzed on sensitivity and to gentamicin, tobramicin, netimicin and amikacin. The disc diffusing technique was applied. The technique ofpolymerase chain reaction was applied to analyze all strains establishing presence in their genomes genes aac (6'-Ie/aph(2"), ant1, aac, ant(6)-Ia, aph (3')-IIIa and ant(4')-Ia coding amino-glycoside-modifying enzymes. The strains sensitive to amino-glycosides had no the given genes in genome. The genome of all strains resistant to amino-glycosides included no less than two of enumerated genes. The 100% correlation was established between phenotypic resistance of analyzed strains to amino-glycosides and availability in them of gene aac(6')-Ie/aph(2").
