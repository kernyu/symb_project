Effect of the antibiotics kanamycin and ampicillin on growth and phase variation of the populations of four strains of lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus sp. M67AT, L. casei MB, Enterococcus faecium M, and E. faecium M3185) was studied. The presence of antibiotics in the medium resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in viable cell numbers and in partial or complete substitution of the dominant S variant with the minor Sm and Sb variants. The variants differed in colony morphology, as well as in some physiological, biochemical, biotechnological, and probiotic characteristics. The Sm type variants of all strains exhibited the highest resistance to antibiotics. High production of exopolysaccharides was found in Sb variants of lactobacilli and in S variants of enterococci. The highest antibacterial activity was found in Sm variants of lactobacilli, especially in Lactobacillus sp. M76AT The latter is biotechnologically the most promising strain, since all variants fermented milk yielding the products with uniformly pronounced functional and organoleptic properties. These patterns are of importance for the understanding of the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance and for selection of the variants with desired properties, as well as for quality control of the lactic acid bacteria starter cultures.
