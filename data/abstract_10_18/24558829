OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influences of triterpenoid from Psidium guajava Leaves (ursolic acid) on the proliferation, differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocyte, and its possible mechanism treat for insulin resistance. METHODS: 3T3-L1 preadipocyte was cultured in vitro. After adding ursolic acid to the culture medium for 48h, the cell viability was tested by MTT assay. Induced for 6 days, the lipid accumulation of adipocyte was measured by Oil Red O staining. The insulin resistant cell model was established with Dexamethasone. Cellular glucose uptake was determined with GOD-POD assays and FFA concentration was determined at the time of 48h. Secreted adiponectin were measured by ELISA. The protein levels of PPARgamma and PTP1B in insulin resistant adipocyte were measured by Western Blotting. RESULTS: Compared with medium control group, 30, 100 micromol/L ursolic acid could increase its proliferation and differentiation significantly (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). Compared with the model group, ursolic acid at 100 micromol/L could enhance cellular glucose uptake of insulin resistant adipocyte significantly both in basic and insulin stimulation state (P < 0.01), while ursolic acid at 30 micromol/L could already enhance its glucose uptake significantly (P < 0.05), and could already decrease its FFA production significantly (P < 0.05). Ursolic acid at 30 micromol/L could increase the secretion of adiponectin on insulin resistant adipocyte significantly (P < 0.05), up-regulate the expression of PPARgamma protein (P < 0.05), but showed no effect on the PTP1B protein expression (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Ursolic acid can improve the proliferation and differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocyte, enhance cellular glucose uptake, inhibit the production of FFA, promote the secretion of adiponectin insulin resistant adipocyte, its mechanism may be related to upregulating the expression of PPARgamma protein.
