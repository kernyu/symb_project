A nasal carriage survey for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in an intensive care unit detected four strains of MRSA with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. The vanA gene was found in two of these vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA) strains. The absence of selective vancomycin pressure might have resulted in reduced expression of the resistant gene.
