Lactoferrin (Lf) is naturally produced by the mammary gland, having biological functions of antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities. To investigate whether the Lf gene is associated with mastitis in dairy cattle, a DNA sequencing approach was used to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene. Three previously reported SNPs in the 5' flanking region and one novel SNP in exon1 of Lf gene were identified. A total of 353 individuals from Holstein cattle populations were genotyped for their SNPs using Created Restriction Site PCR (CRS-PCR) and PCR-RFLP methods. Twenty-two and nineteen combinations of three SNPs (g.3440T>G, g.3879_3880insG, and g.4432T>C) and another three SNPs (g.3429G>A, g.3440T>G, g.3879_3880insG) were observed, respectively. The result of haplotype analysis of four SNPs showed that fourteen different haplotypes were identified. Two major haplotypes (GECB and GECA) occurred with a frequency of 22.5 and 18.5% in the study population, respectively. Statistical analyses revealed no significant association between one single SNP of Lf gene and SCS, whereas significant associations between their combined genotypes of three SNPs, haplotype and SCS. Combined genotype EFCDBB and GGEFDD with the lowest SCS were favorable for the mastitis resistance. They may be used as a possible candidate for marker-assisted selection in dairy cattle breeding program.
