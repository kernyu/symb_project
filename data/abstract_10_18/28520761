BACKGROUND: Inappropriate antibiotic use significantly contributes to antibiotic-resistance, resulting in reduced antibiotic efficacy and increasing physical burden and cost of disease. The goal of this study was to explore antibiotic usage patterns in South Korea using 2007-2014 health insurance claims data. METHODS: We used the Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service data, which represents nearly the entire population of South Korea, to discern patterns in antibiotic prescribing practices. The daily dose, as defined by the World Health Organization ([defined daily doses]/1000 inhabitants/day, [DID]), was used as a measure of antibiotic use. Subgroup analyses were performed on the basis of patient characteristics (sex, age, and disease) and provider characteristics (type of medical institution). RESULTS: Antibiotic use in DID increased from 23.5 in 2007 to 27.7 in 2014. The </= 6 years old age group showed the highest level of usage at 59.21 DID in 2014, and showed an increasing trend each year. DIDs of beta-lactam antibacterials, penicillins (J01C), other beta-lactam antibacterials (J01D), lincosamides and streptogramins (J01F), quinolone antibacterials (J01M), and other antibacterials (J01X) increased over time. CONCLUSION: This study provides valuable statistics regarding antibiotic usage in South Korea; this is important for guiding health policy with regard to antibiotic usage. There is a need for further study exploring antibiotics use and resistance.
