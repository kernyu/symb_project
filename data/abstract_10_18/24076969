We describe the clinical course and virological characteristics of the first H7N9 influenza case in a Taiwanese patient; this patient had detectable viruses in the airway for 2 weeks, during which time an oseltamivir resistance-associated R292K mutation rapidly emerged. Anti-H7N9 antibody was detected 21 days after onset of symptoms, when H7N9 viral load declined significantly.
