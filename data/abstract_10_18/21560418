We determined temporary changes in group B Streptococcus antimicrobial susceptibility and serotype distribution from perinatal strains. We examined invasive microbiological isolates from neonates with early-onset group B streptococcal disease (n = 14), and colonized isolates from those born uneventfully (n = 55) and from the genital tracts of pregnant and puerperal women (n = 198), collected between 1999 and 2009. All isolates were susceptible to penicillin. No significant differences were seen in susceptibility of 12 antimicrobial agents examined between invasive and colonized isolates. MIC50, MIC90, and resistance did not differ between stage I (1999-2005) and II (2006-2009) isolates. Serotype distribution significantly differed, however, serotypes III and Ia predominated among invasive isolates, while serotypes Ib and VI were common among their colonized counterparts. These findings suggest that to date, penicillin remains effective in intrapartum prophylactic use in colonized pregnant women.
