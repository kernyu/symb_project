Foscarnet (FOS) is a pyrophosphate analogue that inhibits both cytomegalovirus (CMV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication. We describe herein the emergence of CMV resistance to FOS in a 54-year-old man receiving FOS salvage therapy because of multidrug-resistant HIV-1 infection. Oral valganciclovir (VGCV) treatment allowed subsequently the improvement of FOS-resistant CMV infection.
