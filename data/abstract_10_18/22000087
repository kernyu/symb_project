This study assessed the changes in serotype distribution and antibiotic resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates in children before and after introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) in Hong Kong. Nasopharyngeal specimens were collected from 1978 and 2211 children (ages, 2 to 6 years) attending day care centers or kindergartens in period 1 (1999-2000) and period 2 (2009-2010), respectively. Carriage of PCV7 serotypes decreased from 12.8% to 8.6% (P < 0.01). The relative contribution of PCV7 serotypes 14 and 18C had decreased, whereas that for non-PCV7 serotypes 19A, 6A, 6C, 23A, and 15B had increased. In period 2, PCV7 penetration rate (at least 1 dose) for children aged 2, 3, 4, and 5 years was 43%, 35.7%, 26.7%, and 20.4%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, PCV7 use was the only independent variable associated with fewer PCV7 serotype carriages (odds ratio 0.5; P = 0.001). In period 2, high rates of dual penicillin/erythromycin nonsusceptibility were found in serotypes 6B (77.3%), 14 (100%), 19F (100%), 23F (78%), 19A (75%), 6A (87.8%), 6C (59.3%), and 23A (78.9%).
