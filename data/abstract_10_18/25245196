Facklamia spp. are gram-positive cocci first described in 1997. They are alpha-hemolytic, facultative anaerobes, catalase-negative cocci, resembling viridians streptococci on 5% sheep blood agar. Facklamia hominis is, by far, the most common species of the 6 so far described, and it is thought that its natural habitat is the female genital tract. Four previous human infections with Facklamia spp. have been documented. We report the first case of a chronic prosthetic joint infection caused by F. hominis and its successful treatment by a 2-stage exchange procedure to eradicate the infection. This is also the first osteoarticular infection reported. The clinical implications are discussed.
