The urinary tract is the most common site of bacterial infections in renal transplant recipients. The management of urinary tract infections (UTI) in renal transplant recipients is becoming more difficult because of drug-resistant bacteria. The antimicrobial susceptibilities of uropathogen bacteria isolated from 398 patients who underwent renal transplantation between 2007 and 2011 were obtained from medical records. At least 1 UTI episode was diagnosed in 172 (43.2%) patients. Among the 703 bacteria isolated from these patients, Exherichia coli the most common pathogen, was isolated from 407/703 episodes (57.8%). Ciprofloxacin, co-trimoxazole, ceftriaxone, and gentamicin resistance rates were 59.4%, 85.7%, 40.7%, and 36.6%, respectively. Ninty six of 407 E. coli isolates (23.5%) were ESBL positive. Analysis of resistance rates in our center demonstrated ciprofloxacin resistance rate in uropathogenic E. coli to have increased gradually from 30.4% in 2003, 41.3% in 2007, and 59.4% in 2012. Instutional data regarding the etiologic agents and antimicrobial susceptibility results are important for proper management of patients with UTI.
