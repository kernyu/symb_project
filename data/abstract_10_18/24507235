OBJECTIVE: To investigate the genetic features of drug resistance to group A streptococcus(GAS) and macrolides antibiotics among pediatric patients in Beijing 2012. METHODS: A total of 199 strains of GAS were collected from 36 hospitals in Beijing between May and July, 2012. All strains were isolated from oropharyngeal swabs. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ten antibiotics (penicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, levofloxacin, tigecycline, vancomycin, linezolid and streptogramin) were detected by VITEK-2 compact with GPS-67 test kit. The genes encoding macrolides resistance (ermA, ermB and mefA ) were amplified and tested by PCR. The macrolides resistant phenotype of group A streptococcus was detected by double disc test (D-test). RESULTS: Among 199 strains of GAS collected in this study, 101(50.8%) were from suburbs and the other 98(49.2%) were from urban areas. 111(55.8%) strains were collected from scarlet fever patients while the other 88(44.2%) were from oropharyngeal infection cases. All the strains were sensitive to penicillin and ampicillin, and the percentage of resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin and tetracycline were 96.5% (192/199), 95.5% (190/199) and 92.0% (183/199), respectively. All strains were susceptible to levofloxacin, tigecycline, vancomycin, linezolid and streptogramin. The rates of resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin and tetracycline were different in different districts, however, the difference in it between ages and clinical diagnosis did not show statistical significance (P > 0.05) . The detected rate of drug resistance gene ermB was 98.5% (196/199). The gene ermA was only detected out in 5 strains and the gene mefA was not detected out. 199 strains showed A macrolides resistant phenotype cMLS, while the phenotype iMLS was not found in this study. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the high level of clindamycin resistance in group A streptococcus collected from children in Beijing, 2012. The macrolides resistance of group A streptococcus was highly prevalent in Beijing, and the dominant phenotype was cMLS mediated by gene ermB.
