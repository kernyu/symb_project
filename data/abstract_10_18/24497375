BACKGROUND: Amaranthus spinosus, a common weed of pastures, is a close relative of Amaranthus palmeri, a problematic agricultural weed with widespread glyphosate resistance. These two species have been known to hybridize, allowing for transfer of glyphosate resistance. Glyphosate-resistant A. spinosus was recently suspected in a cotton field in Mississippi. RESULTS: Glyphosate-resistant A. spinosus biotypes exhibited a fivefold increase in resistance compared with a glyphosate-susceptible biotype. EPSPS was amplified 33-37 times and expressed 37 times more in glyphosate-resistant A. spinosus biotypes than in a susceptible biotype. The EPSPS sequence in resistant A. spinosus plants was identical to the EPSPS in glyphosate-resistant A. palmeri, but differed at 29 nucleotides from the EPSPS in susceptible A. spinosus plants. PCR analysis revealed similarities between the glyphosate-resistant A. palmeri amplicon and glyphosate-resistant A. spinosus. CONCLUSIONS: Glyphosate resistance in A. spinosus is caused by amplification of the EPSPS gene. Evidence suggests that part of the EPSPS amplicon from resistant A. palmeri is present in glyphosate-resistant A. spinosus. This is likely due to a hybridization event between A. spinosus and glyphosate-resistant A. palmeri somewhere in the lineage of the glyphosate-resistant A. spinosus plants. Published 2014.
