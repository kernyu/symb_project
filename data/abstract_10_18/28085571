Treatment of Acinetobacter baumannii has become a medical challenge because of the increasing incidence of multiresistant strains and a lack of viable treatment alternatives. This systematic review attempts to investigate the changes in resistance of A. baumannii to different classes of antibiotics in Iran, with emphasis on the antimicrobial activity of polymyxin B (PMB) and colistin (COL). Biomedical databases were searched for English-published articles evaluating microbiological activity of various antimicrobial agents, including PMB and COL. Then, the available data were extracted and analyzed. Thirty-one studies, published from 2009 to 2015, were identified which contain data for 3,018 A. baumannii clinical isolates. With the exception of polymyxins and tigecycline (TIG), there was a high rate of resistance to various groups of antibiotics, including carbapenems. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranges for PMB and COL on A. baumannii isolates tested were 0.12-64 mug/ml and 0.001-128 mug/ml, respectively. Polymyxins showed adequate activity with no significant trends in the resistance rate during most of the study period. The incidence of resistance to TIG was estimated low from 2% to 38.4% among the majority of A. baumannii. The present systematic review of the published literatures revealed that multidrug-resistant (including carbapenem-resistant) strains of A. baumannii have increased in Iran. In these circumstances, the older antibiotics, such as COL or PMB, preferably in combination with other antimicrobials (rifampicin, meropenem), could be considered as the therapeutic solution against the healthcare-associated infections. Designing rational dosage regimens for patients to maximize the antimicrobial activity and minimize the emergence and prevalence of resistance is recommended.
