BACKGROUND: The efficacy of different letermovir (AIC246, MK8228) doses (60, 120, and 240 mg/day) against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) was evaluated in a recent phase 2b dose-range-finding prophylaxis study in stem-cell transplant recipients. Here we report the genotypic and phenotypic characterization of 15 viral breakthroughs considered to be virological failures. METHODS: Direct sequencing of an HCMV open reading frame UL56 region that included amino acids 230-370 and thus encompassed all known letermovir resistance mutations was followed by marker-transfer experiments to assess the impact of the identified sequence polymorphisms on viral fitness and susceptibility to letermovir. RESULTS: UL56 genotyping was successful for 12 of 15 patients. Six amino acid substitutions were detected in 5 patients. In 1 subject from the 60-mg-dose group, the known letermovir resistance mutation V236M was identified subsequent to a wild-type viremic episode. The remaining 5 sequence variants (L134V, S227I, Q228H, R410G, and D414N) were shown to be inert with regard to letermovir susceptibility, thus representing natural polymorphisms. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings represent the first case of a letermovir resistance mutation emerging in the clinic, apparently because of a suboptimal prophylactic dose (60 mg/day). This is in agreement with the trial's efficacy analyses, findings of which suggest that letermovir doses of 60 mg/day and 120 mg/day are suboptimal for prophylaxis whereas a dose of 240 mg/day appears to achieve complete suppression of viremia.
