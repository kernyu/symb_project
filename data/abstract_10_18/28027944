Biofilm architecture provides bacteria with enhanced antibiotic resistance, thus raising the need to search for alternative therapies that can inhibit the bacterial colonization. In the present study, we synthesized graphene oxide-silver nanocomposite (GO-Ag) by non-toxic and eco-friendly route using a floral extract of Legistromia speciosa (L.) Pers. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of plant extract revealed the presence of compounds which can simultaneously act as reducing and capping agents. The sub-inhibitory concentrations of synthesized GO-Ag reduced the biofilm formation in both gram-negative (E. cloacae) and gram-positive (S. mutans) bacterial models. Growth curve assay, membrane integrity assay, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) revealed different mechanisms of biofilm inhibition in E. cloacae and S. mutans. Moreover, quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) results suggested GO-Ag is acting on S. mutans biofilm formation cascade. Biofilm inhibitory concentrations GO-Ag were also found to be non-toxic against HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney cell line). The whole study highlights the therapeutic potential of GO-Ag to restrain the onset of biofilm formation in bacteria.
