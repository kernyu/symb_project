OBJECTIVES: Amino acid insertions in the protease gene have been reported rarely, and mainly in patients receiving protease inhibitors (PIs). The aim of the study was to assess the long-term viro-immunological follow-up of HIV-infected patients harbouring virus with protease insertions. METHODS: Cases of virus exhibiting protease insertions were identified in routine resistance genotyping tests. Therapeutic, immunological and virological data were retrospectively collected. RESULTS: Eleven patients harbouring virus with a protease gene insertion were detected (prevalence 0.24%), including three PI-naive patients. The insertions were mainly located between codons 33 and 39 and associated with surrounding mutations (M36I/L and R41K). The three PI-naive patients were infected with an HIV-1 non-B subtype. Follow-up of these PI-naive patients showed that the insert-containing virus persisted for several years, was archived in HIV DNA, and displayed a reduced viral replicative capacity with no impact on resistance level. Of the eight PI-experienced patients, 63% were infected with HIV-1 subtype B; one had been antiretroviral-free for 5 years and seven were heavily PI-experienced (median duration of follow-up 24 months; range 10-62 months). The protease insertion was selected under lopinavir in four patients and under darunavir in one, in the context of major PI-resistance mutations, and following long-term exposure to PIs. The insert-containing virus persisted for a median of 32 months (range 12-62 months) and displayed no specific impact on phenotypic resistance level or viral replicative capacity. CONCLUSION: Our data, obtained during long-term follow-up, show that insertions in the protease gene do not seem to have an impact on resistance level. This finding supports the recommendation of PI-based regimens, although further work is required to confirm it.
