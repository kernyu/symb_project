Meningococcal gyrA gene sequence data, MICs, and mouse infection were used to define the ciprofloxacin breakpoint for Neisseria meningitidis. Residue T91 or D95 of GyrA was altered in all meningococcal isolates with MICs of >/= 0.064 mug/ml but not among isolates with MICs of </= 0.032 mug/ml. Experimental infection of ciprofloxacin-treated mice showed slower bacterial clearance when GyrA was altered. These data suggest a MIC of >/= 0.064 mug/ml as the ciprofloxacin breakpoint for meningococci and argue for the molecular detection of ciprofloxacin resistance.
