Serratia marcescens gained resistance to both biocides and antibiotics on expressing the SdeAB efflux pump, following exposure to increasingly higher concentrations of a biocide (H. Maseda et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 53:5230-5235, 2009). To reveal the regulatory mechanism of sdeAB expression, wild-type cells were subjected to transposon-mediated random mutagenesis, and a mutant with antibiotic resistance, which mimicked the phenotype of the previous biocide-resistant cells, was obtained. The transposon element was found in the chromosomal DNA downstream of the sdeAB operon. Sequencing revealed the presence of an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a protein with 159 amino acid residues that is highly similar to the BadM-type transcriptional repressor, designated sdeS. The level of sdeB::xylE reporter gene expression, undetectable in the wild-type cells, appeared to be fully comparable to that in the biocide-resistant cells. Nucleotide sequencing of the mutant revealed sdeS to have a single G-to-A base substitution at position 269 that converted Trp90 to a stop codon. Introduction of a plasmid-borne intact sdeS into the mutant cells and the biocide-resistant cells resulted in a reduction in sdeB::xylE reporter activity to an undetectable level. These results suggested that SdeS functions as a repressor of the sdeAB operon. It was concluded that the original biocide-resistant cells had an impaired sdeS and, therefore, a derepressed level of the SdeAB efflux pump.
