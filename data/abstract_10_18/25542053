The emergence and spread of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae is an important and very concerning problem. There is an urgent need of new antibimicrobials for treating these infections. Currently there are some options in the pipeline. Several new beta-lactamase and carbapenemase inhibitors as avibactam and MK-7655, combined with old or new betalactams are a very interesting option. Some combinations as ceftazidime-avibactam are in the late stages of clinical development and could reach the market in the next years. New aminoglycosides as plazomicin, tetracycline derivates as eravacycline, and several other new molecules as monosulfactams are currently in different stages of development.
