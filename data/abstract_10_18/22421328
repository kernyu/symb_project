Minimum inhibitory concentrations of sitafloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin, levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against 59 ciprofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from Japan were determined. The isolates were most susceptible to sitafloxacin and gatifloxacin. To understand better the basis for drug resistance, nucleotide sequences encoding the gyrA and gyrB quinolone resistance-determining region were determined. Predicted amino acid sequences revealed distinct mutational patterns likely to be responsible for fluoroquinolone resistance. Double gyrA mutations as well as mutations in both gyrA and gyrB correlated with increased resistance to all fluoroquinolones.
