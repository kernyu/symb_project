Protease inhibitors have been known to confer multiple stress tolerance in transgenic plants. We have assessed growth of yeast (Pichia pastoris GS115) strains expressing inhibitory repeat domains (PpIRD(+)) of previously characterized Capsicum annuum protease inhibitors under high salt, heavy metal and oxidative stress. PpIRD(+) strains exhibited multiple stress tolerance and showed differential molecular responses at transcriptional and translational level on exposure to stress inducing agents like heavy metal, high salt and H2O2. PpIRD(+) strains display significant reduction in metacaspase (Yca1) activity, the key enzyme in apoptosis, indicates the possibility of cross reactivity of IRDs (serine protease inhibitor) with cysteine proteases. PpIRD(+) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae knockout with Yca1 (DeltaYca1) strain showed similar growth characteristics under stress, which indicated the delayed senescence due to cellular metacaspase inhibition. Molecular docking study showed a close proximity of IRDs reactive site and the active site of metacaspase in the complex that signified their strong interactions. Maintenance of GAPDH activity, primary target of metacaspase, in PpIRD(+) strain evidenced the inhibition of metacaspase activity and survival of these cells under stress. This report demonstrates a potential molecular mechanism of protease inhibitor-based multiple stress tolerance in yeast strains.
