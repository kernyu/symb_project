OBJECTIVE: To explain a definition of "interface respiratory failure" as arterial blood gas assay with arterial oxygen partial pressure in the range of 60-75 mmHg. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We compared arterial blood gases (ABGs), resting respiratory drive and its derivatives, mechanics of respiratory muscles, resistance and compliance of the respiratory tract and some important cytokines (interleukin-4 and interferon-gamma) of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) subgroups (total 50 cases) and control group (25 cases). RESULTS: The patients attaining the "interface respiratory failure" stage developed great changes in respiratory mechanics parameters and inflammatory mediator, which might cause the exacerbation of COPD and the inclination to generate "real respiratory failure" and COPD progression. CONCLUSIONS: The definition of interface respiratory failure is scientific, direct and its width is appropriate. We should intervene appropriately and positively to avoid progression from "interface respiratory failure" to the "real respiratory failure" stage, and this avoidance means a higher survival rate and a lower medical expense. Interventions should focus on oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, improving respiratory compliance, cytokines and anti-infective agents, respectively.
