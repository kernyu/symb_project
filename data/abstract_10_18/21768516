Virological residual activity (VRA) denotes the degree of HIV RNA suppression achieved by antiretroviral therapy in the presence of resistant virus. This concept is particularly important in resource-limited settings, where rapid switching after detection of virological failure may not be feasible. Using data from the NORA trial, we estimated VRA for two regimens-zidovudine-lamivudine-abacavir (ZDV-3TC-ABC) and zidovudine-lamivudine-nevirapine (ZDV-3TC-NVP)-and related this to the phenotypic drug sensitivity of the component drugs in the two regimens. Plasma samples at weeks 0, 48, and 96 were retrospectively assayed for HIV-1 RNA, and genotypic/phenotypic resistance testing was performed if HIV-1 RNA exceeded 1,000 copies/ml. Virological residual activity (VRA) was defined as the difference between log(10)(HIV RNA) at week 48 or 96 and week 0 and related to 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) relative to wild-type virus for ZDV and ABC (fold change [FC]). Twenty-seven samples in the ZDV-3TC-NVP group and 56 in the ZDV-3TC-ABC group contributed to the analysis. Mean VRA was significantly higher in the ZDV-3TC-ABC group than in the ZDV-3TC-NVP at week 48 (1.62 versus 0.90) and week 96 (1.29 versus 0.78). There was a weak and nonsignificant relationship between VRA and ZDV FC, with VRA decreasing by 0.1 log(10) copies/ml per 2-fold increase in ZDV. The association with ABC FC was much stronger, with a marked reduction in VRA occurring at ABC FC values greater than approximately 2. This information should be considered in future treatment guidelines relevant to resource-poor settings.
