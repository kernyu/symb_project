Because Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) would cause carcinogenesis of the stomach, we need sufficient information for deciding on an appropriate strategy of eradication. Many factors affect the efficacy of eradication including antimicrobial resistance (especially clarithromycin resistance) and CYP2C19 polymorphism. This study was to survey the efficiency of gastric juice for detecting H pylori infection, clarithromycin resistance, and CYP2C19 polymorphism.The specimens of gastric juice were collected from all patients while receiving gastroscopy. DNA was extracted from gastric juice and then urease A and cag A were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detecting the existence of H pylori. By PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), the 23S rRNA of H pylori and CYP2C19 genotypes of host were examined respectively. During endoscopy examination, biopsy-based specimens were also collected for rapid urease test, culture, and histology. The blood samples were also collected for analysis of CYP2C19 genotypes. We compared the results of gastric juice tests with the results of traditional clinical tests.When compared with the results from traditional clinical tests, our results from gastric juice showed that the sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy to detect H pylori infection were 92.1% (105/114), 92.9% (143/154), 90.5% (105/116), 94.1% (143/152), and 92.5% (248/268), respectively. The SEN, SPE, PPV, and NPV to detect clarithromycin resistance were 97.3% (36/37), 91.5% (43/47), 90.0% (36/40), and 97.7% (43/44), respectively. By using PCR-RFLP, the consistency of human CYP2C19 gene polymorphism from blood samples and gastric juice was as high as 94.9% (149/157).The manipulated gastric juice is actually an effective diagnostic sample for evaluation of H pylori existence, clarithromycin resistance, and host CYP2C19 polymorphism.
