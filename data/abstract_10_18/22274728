PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review discusses the relevant studies on selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD) published between 2009 and mid-2011. RECENT FINDINGS: In a multicenter cluster-randomized cross-over study in the Netherlands, SDD and selective oropharyngeal decontamination (SOD) were associated with higher survival at day 28, with a lower incidence of ICU-acquired bacteremia and with less acquisition of respiratory tract colonization with antibiotic resistant pathogens, compared to standard care. A post-hoc analysis of this study suggests that SDD might be more effective in surgical patients and SOD in nonsurgical patients. In a randomized study perioperative use of SDD in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery was associated with lower incidences of anastomotic leakages. A Cochrane meta-analysis, not including any of the before mentioned studies, reported a reduction of respiratory tract infections in studies by using topical antibiotics only and higher survival rates when topical antibiotics were combined with parenteral antibiotics. SUMMARY: Recent studies show that in ICUs with low levels of antibiotic resistance, SDD and SOD improved patient outcome and reduced infections and carriage with antibiotic-resistant pathogens. The effect in settings with higher levels of antibiotic resistance remains to be determined as well as the efficacy of SDD and SOD in specific patient groups.
