INTRODUCTION: The current problems of the treatment of infections by Acinetobacter baumannii are linked with the increase of multidrug- and extensive-drug resistance and the lack of development of new antimicrobial drugs for Gram-negative bacilli. For these reasons, new alternatives for the treatment and control of severe infections by A. baumannii are necessary. Several studies have reported the effect of adjuvants to restore the efficacy of existing antimicrobial agents. AREAS COVERED: In the present review, the authors describe the main results in the development of adjuvant drugs as well as new data on antimicrobial peptides, in monotherapy or in combination therapy with existing antimicrobial agents, which have shown promising preclinical results in vitro and in vivo. EXPERT OPINION: The preclinical evaluation of adjuvants and antimicrobial peptides, in monotherapy or in combination therapy, for A. baumannii infections has shown promising results. However, caution is needed and further extensive in vivo studies and clinical trials have to be performed to confirm the potential use of these adjuvants as true therapeutic alternatives.
