BACKGROUND: Treatment of urinary tract infections (UTI) in the spinal cord injury (SCI) population is often difficult due to the lack of symptoms, increased resistance, and increased morbidity and mortality associated with UTIs. OBJECTIVE: To develop an algorithm-based order set for the treatment of UTIs for patients with SCI based on SCI-specific antibiogram data in order to assess and improve current antimicrobial prescribing practices at the Clement J. Zablocki Veterans Affairs Medical Center (ZVAMC). METHODS: This study is a retrospective, pre- and post-implementation analysis of an order set based on SCI antibiogram data. Descriptive statistics were used to compare baseline data and characteristics and chi squared tests were used to evaluate the primary outcome and all secondary outcomes. To achieve a power of 80% with an effect size of 0.3, the goal was to assess 45 antimicrobial treatment courses in the pre-implementation group and 45 antimicrobial treatment courses in the post-implementation group. RESULTS: The percentage of appropriate antimicrobial treatment courses increased from 47.9% in the pre-intervention group (n = 73) to 71.8% in the post-intervention group (n = 39), which was statistically significant (P = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SCI treated for UTIs within the ZVAMC had a significantly higher percentage of appropriate treatment courses following the implementation of a unit-specific antibiogram, electronic order set, and educational in-service for providers. An order set and unit-specific antibiogram with related education may be beneficial in improving antimicrobial therapy from a stewardship perspective.
