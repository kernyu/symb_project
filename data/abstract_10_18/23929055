BACKGROUND: Increasing numbers of Staphylococcus aureus infections demonstrate antibiotic resistance. Military populations experiencing crowding are at increased risk of community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) infection. High prevalence of CA-MRSA infection among Army personnel was previously documented at Fort Benning, GA from 2002 to 2007. PURPOSE: To ascertain recent CA-MRSA trends at Fort Benning regarding antibiotic susceptibility, infection rates, and treatment regimens among Army personnel. METHODS: Incident CA-MRSA cases among active duty members/trainees from January 2008 to December 2010 were identified using active surveillance and laboratory data. RESULTS: In total, 2,171 infections were identified, representing 5,794 CA-MRSA-related clinic visits. Annual rates decreased from 33 to 27 infections per 1,000 soldiers from 2008 to 2010. Approximately 78% of isolates were from training units. Approximately 4% of infections required hospitalization. Most infections (97%) were treated with antibiotics (36% received antibiotics and wound drainage). Antibiotic susceptibility patterns remained comparable to previous assessments. CONCLUSION: The observed decline in CA-MRSA rates and associated hospitalizations, coupled with stable antibiotic susceptibility patterns, is encouraging. Passive surveillance using laboratory records proved useful in identifying infection and could enhance detection across training sites. Given the continued high CA-MRSA prevalence among trainees, providers/public health personnel should remain vigilant to bolster prevention, detection, and treatment efforts.
