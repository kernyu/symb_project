Emergence of drug resistant tuberculosis is one of the major challenges faced by health community globally. Tuberculosis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality among children in endemic areas, yet little is known regarding epidemiology of pediatric tuberculosis and even far lesser information is available about epidemiology, diagnosis, management and treatment outcome of drug resistant tuberculosis in children. Despite limited data and difficulties in its management, drug resistant tuberculosis can be successfully treated even in resource poor settings with proper use of existing technologies. A high index of suspicion and early drug susceptibility testing is the key to early diagnosis and good treatment outcome. Difficulties in establishing the diagnosis, drug toxicities and absence of pediatric formulations add challenges to the management of Pediatric MDR TB Cases. Active research is required to answer the unresolved issues of finding optimal diagnostic tools, treatment regimens and duration and chemoprophylaxis in pediatric drug resistant tuberculosis.
