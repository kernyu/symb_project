In this work, a novel multifunctional NIR-sensitive nanoplatform has been developed for synergistic eradication of antibiotic-resistant bacteria based biofilms in vitro and in vivo. With high biocompatibility and an outstanding synergistic effect, our system provides a promising avenue to preventing and combating biofilm-associated infections.
