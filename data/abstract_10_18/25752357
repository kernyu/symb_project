BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication has always been a concern. In our previous study, 14-day hybrid regimen showed ideal results. Based on these findings, we decided to compare the efficacy of 10- and 14-day hybrid regimens for H. pylori eradication. METHODS: Two hundred and seventy patients with peptic ulcer disease and H. pylori infection were enrolled in the study. One hundred and thirty-four patients received 10-day hybrid regimen (PACT-10): pantoprazole, 40 mg, and amoxicillin, 1 g, both twice daily for 10 days; plus clarithromycin, 500 mg, and tinidazole, 500 mg, both twice daily just during the last 5 days. One hundred and thirty-six patients received 14-day hybrid regimen (PACT-14): pantoprazole, 40 mg, and amoxicillin, 1 g, both twice a day for 14 days; plus clarithromycin, 500 mg, and tinidazole, 500 mg, both twice daily just for the last 7 days. Eight weeks after treatment, (14) C-urea breath test was performed to evaluate H. pylori eradication. RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty patients (124 patients in PACT-10 and 126 patients in PACT-14 regimens) completed the study. The intention-to-treat eradication rates were 77.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 70.6-84.6%) and 86% (95% CI: 80-92%) for the two regimens, respectively (p = .17). Per-protocol eradication rates were 83.8% (95% CI: 80-86%) and 92.8% (95% CI: 88-96%), respectively (p < .01). There were no significant intergroup differences in compliance to treatment or discontinuation of therapy due to severe side effects. CONCLUSION: Ten-day hybrid regimen could not achieve acceptable eradication rate. However, 14-day hybrid regimen seems to be an acceptable option for H. pylori eradication in Iran.
