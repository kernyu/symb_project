This study investigated the occurrence and antimicrobial resistance profiles of Escherichia coli and Salmonella sp. isolated from swine samples submitted to the Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (MVDL) in Saint Paul, Minnesota from 1995 to 2004. During this time period, a total of 5072 E. coli and 2793 Salmonella sp. was isolated. Most of these isolates were found to be resistant to the tetracycline and beta-lactam group of antibiotics. Resistance to spectinomycin was also frequently observed. An increasing trend in ampicillin resistance and a decreasing trend in apramycin resistance were seen in both pathogens, although ampicillin resistance was relatively higher in E. coli than in Salmonella. Aminoglycoside (amikacin) and quinolone (enrofloxacin) were the only antimicrobials to which minimum or no resistance was observed. The resistance of pig pathogens to several antibiotics indicates the need to routinely monitor the use of these antimicrobials and their associated resistance in pig populations.
