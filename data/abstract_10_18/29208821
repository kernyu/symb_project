The current evidence of postoperative endophthalmitis management in three important components of care-infection control, inflammation control, and prevention was reviewed, and their current relevance and application in an Indian context were evaluated. The publications from India indicated that Gram-negative bacterial and filamentous fungal infections are relatively higher. There are increasing instances of resistance to ceftazidime by Gram-negative microorganisms. Intravitreal dexamethasone limits inflammation in bacterial endophthalmitis when given together with the intravitreal antibiotics. Intracameral antibiotic could reduce postcataract surgery infection at least in less rigorous surgical environment. Systematic collection of data and periodic evaluation of the current practice against the new evidence are necessary to prevent or treat postcataract surgery endophthalmitis.
