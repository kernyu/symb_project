Data on resistance from ambulatory care are rarely available, since surveillance systems cover mostly isolates come from inpatient care. The outpatient setting is of interest, however, since it is where hospitalized patients with resistant pathogens are also treated as outpatients, and where patients are seen who have resistant pathogens from other sources, such as food. In addition, 85% of the antibiotics used in human medicine, are used in ambulatory care. Using data from the Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance System (ARS), we show the development of resistance of Staphylococcus aureus to oxacillin and of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae to cefotaxime in outpatient care between 2008 and 2012 and corresponding socio-demographic differences in the resistance rate. According to our analyses, the proportion of MRSA in S. aureus since 2009 in the outpatient sector decreased (all materials: 2009 11.5%, 2012 9.8%), which is similar to inpatient care, while the proportion of ESBL in E. coli (2008 2.7%, 2012 5.6%), and K. pneumoniae (2008 2.7%, 2012 6.6%) increased over the total period. At the same time resistance for the three pathogens in both sexes over the age groups continuously increased, women still hold a lower proportion of resistance than men. The resistance levels of S. aureus and K. pneumoniae in ambulatory care are reflected at a lower level than in hospital care. In contrast, the high proportion of resistant E. coli in children suggests another source in ambulatory care.
