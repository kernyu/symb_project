OBJECTIVES: Following antiretroviral therapy failure, patients are often treated with a three-drug regimen that includes two nucleoside/tide reverse transcriptase inhibitors [N(t)RTIs]. An alternative two-drug nucleoside-sparing regimen may decrease the pill burden and drug toxicities associated with the use of N(t)RTIs. The Intelence aNd pRezista Once A Day Study (INROADS; NCT01199939) evaluated the nucleoside-sparing regimen of etravirine 400 mg with darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg once-daily in HIV-1-infected treatment-experienced subjects or treatment-naive subjects with transmitted resistance. METHODS: In this exploratory phase 2b, single-arm, open-label, multicentre, 48-week study, the primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who achieved HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at week 48 [confirmed virological response (CVR), non-virological failure (VF) censored]. Key secondary endpoints included assessments of changes from baseline to week 48 in viral load, immunological response, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, safety, tolerability, metabolic and bone markers and body fat. RESULTS: Forty-one of the 54 enrolled subjects completed the study. Adverse events (7%) and VF (7%) were the most common reasons for discontinuation. The week 48 CVR rate in the intent-to-treat (ITT) non-VF censored population was 89% (primary endpoint). Seven subjects experienced VF. Common adverse events were diarrhoea (15%), rash (15%) and upper respiratory tract infection (11%). Mild/moderate lipid elevations, minimal changes in limb fat distribution and bone mineral density and no clinically relevant changes in glucose metabolism were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Etravirine 400 mg and darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg as a two-drug once-daily regimen in treatment-experienced subjects or treatment-naive subjects with transmitted resistance was virologically efficacious and well tolerated.
