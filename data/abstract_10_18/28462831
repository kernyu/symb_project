Docetaxel is a commonly used chemotherapeutic drug for patients with late stage prostate cancer. However, serious side effect and drug resistance limit its clinical success. Brefeldin A is a 16-membered macrolide antibiotic from mangrove-derived Fungus Aspergillus sp. (9Hu), which exhibited potent cytotoxicity against human cancer cells. In the present study, we determined the effect of brefeldin A on docetaxel-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells. Brefeldin A in combination with docetaxel inhibited the growth of PC-3 cells in monolayer and in three dimensional cultures. The combination also potently stimulated apoptosis in PC-3 cells as determined by propidium iodide staining and morphological assessment. Mechanistic studies showed that growth inhibition and apoptosis in PC-3 cells treated with brefeldin A and docetaxel were associated with decrease in the level of Bcl-2. The present study indicates that combined brefeldin A with docetaxel may represent a novel approach for improving the efficacy of docetaxel, and Bcl-2 may serve as a target for brefeldin A to enhance the effects of docetaxel chemotherapy.
