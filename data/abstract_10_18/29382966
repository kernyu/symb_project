The use of antibiotics in livestock production in North America and possible association with elevated abundance of detectable antimicrobial resistance genes (ARG) is a growing concern. Real-time, quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to determine the relative abundance and diversity of ARG in fecal composite and catch basin samples from 4 beef feedlots in Alberta. Samples from a surrounding waterway and municipal wastewater treatment plants were also included to compare the ARG profile of urban environments and fresh water with that of feedlots. The relative abundance of 18 resistance genes across 5 antibiotic families including sulfonamides, tetracyclines, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, and beta-lactams was examined. Sulfonamide, fluoroquinolone, and beta-lactam resistance genes predominated in wastewater treatment samples, while tetracycline resistance genes predominated in cattle fecal composite samples. These results reflect the types of antibiotic that are used in cattle versus humans, but other factors such as co-selection of ARG and variation in the composition of bacterial communities associated with these samples may also play a role.
