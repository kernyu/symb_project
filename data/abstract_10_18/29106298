Salmonella Enteritidis remains a standout among the leading causes of foodborne diseases worldwide. Previous studies have demonstrated that a unique clonal group of Salmonella Enteritidis, named SE86, is involved in foodborne outbreaks in southern Brazil and is frequently identified among strains isolated from poultry. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of the isolation source (food products involved in salmonellosis outbreaks and poultry sources) on the phenotypic and molecular characteristics of Salmonella Enteritidis SE86. A biofilm formation assay, antimicrobial susceptibility test, polymerase chain reaction identification of virulence-associated genes, and phage type 4 (PT4) assessment were performed to characterize Salmonella Enteritidis SE86. The human strains presented less antimicrobial resistance than the poultry strains. Resistance to some substances was related to the isolation source of the strain. Strains of the same clonal group presented different biofilm production abilities. Biofilm formation was independent of the isolation source at all temperatures. Temperature influenced biofilm formation only by the poultry strains. Most of the investigated genes presented a high frequency and a regular distribution, regardless of the isolation source. The spvB, spiA, pagC, sipB, prgH, spaN, sitC, and lpfC genes were associated with the avian strains, whereas iroN was associated with the strains isolated from food products involved in salmonellosis outbreaks. Most strains belonged to PT4. No relationship was found between biofilm production and antimicrobial resistance or between the virulence profile and biofilm production or antimicrobial resistance.
