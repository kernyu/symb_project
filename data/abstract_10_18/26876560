Bacteria of genus Vibrio with multidrug resistance in shrimp farm environment were recurrent. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial resistance profile of 70 strains of Vibrio isolated from water and sediment of Acarau estuary, Ceara, Brazil. In order to achieve this goal, disk diffusion technique was used with the following antimicrobial agents: ampicillin (Amp), aztreonam (Atm), cephalothin (Cef), cefotaxime (Ctx), ceftriaxone (Cro), ciprofloxacin (Cip), chloramphenicol (Clo), florfenicol (Flo), nitrofurantoin (Nit), gentamicin (Gen), oxytetracycline (Otc), tetracycline (Tet), streptomycin (Str), nalidixic acid (Nal), and sulfazotrim (Sut). All Vibrio strains were resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent, being verified as 17 multidrug-resistant profiles. All strains resistant to Otc and Tet were characterized to exhibit plasmidial resistance. Therefore, Vibrio strains from Acarau estuary pose a risk to public health and aquatic culture.
