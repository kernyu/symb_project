PURPOSE: To compare the attenuating effects of milrinone versus nitroglycerin on pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) increase caused by repeat intravenous bolus injection of absolute ethanol in anesthetized dogs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four dogs were randomly distributed into three groups: a control group (group C), a nitroglycerin group (treated with a continuous infusion of nitroglycerin at 5.0 microg/kg/min; group N), and a milrinone group (treated with a continuous infusion of milrinone at 3.0 microg/kg/min after an initial bolus dose of 100 microg/kg; group M). Absolute ethanol (0.1 mL/kg) was injected at 10-minute intervals via a 5-F angiographic catheter advanced into the proximal portion of the inferior vena cava. Immediately before and after each intravenous injection of absolute ethanol, hemodynamic values were obtained through a pulmonary arterial catheter. RESULTS: Group M showed more stable hemodynamic values of systolic, mean, and diastolic PAP and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) compared with groups C and N. In addition, group M showed significantly higher values of cardiac output versus group C at 10 minutes after the 10th bolus of ethanol. After restoration of spontaneous breathing, group M also showed the least hemodynamic changes in systolic, mean, and diastolic PAPs and PVR among the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although a continuous infusion of nitroglycerin or milrinone effectively prevented cardiovascular deterioration, milrinone was superior to nitroglycerin in managing the acute hemodynamic changes that resulted from repeated intravenous bolus injections of absolute ethanol (0.1 mL/kg) in healthy anesthetized dogs.
