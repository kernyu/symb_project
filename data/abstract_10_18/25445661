The present study was undertaken to determine the occurrence and characterization of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli isolated from cattle and poultry in Odisha, India. Of 316 E. coli isolated from 305 samples (170 fecal samples from poultry and 135 milk samples from cattle), a total of 18 E. coli isolates were confirmed as ESBL producers by combination disc method and ESBL E-test. The isolates were resistant to oxyimino cephalosporins and monobactam as revealed by disc diffusion assay and determination of minimum inhibitory concentration. Resistance against other antibiotics was frequently noted as well. Further, beta-lactamase genes viz., blaSHV, blaCTXM, blaTEM and blaampC were detected in 17, 13, 9 and 2 isolates, respectively in PCR. Of the 18 ESBL strains, 16 were positive for class I integron (int1), nine of them carried sulphonamide resistance gene (sul1) and one harbored quinolone resistance gene (qnrB). Virulence markers for extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli like astA, tsh and iucD were also present in 4, 3 and 3 isolates, respectively. All the PCR amplified products were cloned and subjected to sequencing for homology analysis and data were submitted to gene bank. Sequence analysis of the amplified variable regions of class 1 integron of four representative isolates revealed the presence of aadA2 and dfrA12 gene cassettes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides and trimethoprim, respectively. Most of the ESBL producing strains emerged as single lineage through phylogenetic analysis by RAPD and ERIC PCR. This is the first ever systemic study on multidrug resistant ESBL producing E. coli in food producing animals from India.
