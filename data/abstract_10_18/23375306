BACKGROUND: Since the introduction of lamivudine to treat chronic hepatitis B (CHB), the prevalence of lamivudine resistance is increasing among orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) candidates in Korea. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of pre-OLT lamivudine-resistance on the post-OLT prognosis of recipients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Consecutive OLT recipient at a single tertiary care center (n = 8) between September 1999 and August 2009 were tested preoperatively for genotypic lamivudine resistance. We compared overall survival as well as incidences of graft failure, recurrent hepatitis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) between patients with (n = 35) versus without (n = 46) lamivudine-resistance. RESULTS: Mortality occurred in 2 resistant and 3 nonresistant individuals. The occurrences of graft failure, recurrent hepatitis, and HCC were 1, 2, and 2 cases, respectively, in the resistance group versus 2, 2, and 2 cases, respectively, in the nonresistance cohort. Univariate analysis showed no significant difference in survival, graft failure, HCC occurrence, and recurrent hepatitis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that pre-OLT lamivudine-resistance did not significantly affect the post-OLT prognosis. Thus, lamivudine-resistance may not be a barrier when considering OLT in patients with underlying CHB as a therapeutic modality, if it is treated with appropriate antiviral agents.
