OBJECTIVES: A carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex (CRA complex) infection is one of most the difficult infections to control worldwide. We evaluated the long-term effects of infection control interventions on the incidence densities of healthcare-associated infection (HAI) and CRA complex infection, and the rates of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex bacteremia (AB). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis at the Changhua Christian Hospital from January 2002 to December 2013. Interventions for infection control were implemented from 2002 to 2009 (period 1). From 2010 to 2013 (period 2), infection control programs were improved by in-service education and a hand hygiene campaign to prepare for international and national hospital accreditation. The effectiveness of infection and antibiotic control programs was assessed according to the incidence densities of HAI and CRA complex, rates of CRA complex and of AB, chlorhexidine consumption density, and defined daily dose of antibiotics. RESULTS: The incidence density of HAI decreased from 4.56 per thousand to 1.52 per thousand from periods 1 to 2 (P<0.001). Likewise, the incidence of AB decreased from 177.79 to 137.76 per person-years per 100,000 admissions (P<0.001). The incidence density of CRA complex ranged from 3.17-7.38 per thousand. The chlorhexidine consumption density increased from 5.5 to 45.5 L per 1000 patient-days (P<0.001). The consumption of piperacillin-tazobactam was lower in period 2 than in period 1 (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Education for infection control programs, hand hygiene campaigns, and antibiotics control programs may decrease the incidence density of AB and HAI, and may help control CRA complex infection.
