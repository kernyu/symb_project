The aims of this study were to i) reveal the population pharmacokinetics; and ii) assess the probability of target attainment (PTA) and cumulative fraction of response (CFR) (defined as the expected population PTA for a specific drug dose and a specific population of microorganisms) of imipenem in febrile neutropenic patients with bacteraemia. Ten patients were randomised into two groups: Group I received a 0.5-h infusion of 0.5 g of imipenem every 6 h (q6h) for 8 doses; and Group II received a 4-h infusion of 0.5 g q6h for 8 doses. A Monte Carlo simulation was performed to determine the PTA. The volume of distribution and total clearance of imipenem were 20.78 +/- 1.35 l and 23.19 +/- 1.34 l/h, respectively. Only a 4-h infusion of 1 g q6h regimen achieved a PTA >93% for 80% T>MIC for a MIC of 2 mug/ml. A 4-h infusion of all simulated regimens and a 0.5-h infusion of 0.5 g q6h and 1 g q6h achieved targets (CFR >/= 90%) against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. However, against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp., no regimens achieved their targets. In conclusion, the results indicate that a higher than manufacturer's dosage recommendation is required to maximize the activity of imipenem.
