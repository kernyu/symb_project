A strategy is described to identify new antimalarial agents to overcome the drug resistance and/or failure issues through in silico screening of multiple biological targets. As a part of this, three enzymes namely CTPS, CK, and GST were selected, from among 56 drug targets of P. falciparum, and used them in virtual screening of ZINC database entries which led to the design and synthesis of arylsulfonyloxy acetimidamides as their consensus inhibitors. From these, two compounds showed good activity against sensitive (3D7; IC50, 1.10 and 1.45 muM) and resistant (K1; IC50, 2.10 and 2.13 muM) strains of the parasite, and they were further investigated through docking and molecular dynamics simulations. The findings of this study collectively paved the way for arylsulfonyloxy acetimidamides as a new class of antimalarial agents.
