Kibdelomycin is a complex novel antibiotic, discovered by applying a highly sophisticated chemical-genetic Staphylococcus aureus Fitness Test (SaFT) approach, that inhibits the clinically established bacterial targets, gyrase and topoisomerase IV. It exhibits broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against aerobic bacteria including MRSA and Acinetobacter baumannii. It is slowly bactericidal and has a low frequency of resistance. In an anaerobic environment, it exhibits narrow-spectrum activity and inhibits the growth of gut bacteria Clostridium difficile (MIC 0.125mug/mL) without affecting the growth of commensal Gram-negative organisms particularly, Bacteroides sp. It is highly efficacious in the hamster model of C. difficile infection providing 100% protection at >6mg/kg and 80% protection at 1.56mg/kg by oral dosing without systemic exposure. X-ray co-crystal structures of kibdelomycin bound to GyrB and ParE showed a unique dual arm 'U shaped' multisite binding never encountered with any other gyrase inhibitors. Kibdelomycin is poised for preclinical development for C. difficile treatment, and most importantly, the co-crystal structures of kibdelomycin provide unique insight for structure-guided structure modification, which could lead to better broader-spectrum systemic antibiotic potentially covering many ESKAPE pathogens.
