BACKGROUND: Patients with platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) experience poor outcome. Currently, no clearly superior management strategy exists for platinum-resistant EOC patients. PURPOSE: Analyze the efficacy and safety of gemcitabine-oxaliplatin (GEMOX) in platinum resistant EOC patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-two patients with platinum-based resistant EOC were included. Studied patients had received GEM at the dose of 1000mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8 and OX 100mg/m(2) on day 1, administered over 2h 30min after GEM infusion of 3week treatment cycle. RESULTS: In the evaluation of tumor response, none of patients had achieved CR while PR, SD, were observed in 7 (21.9%), 9 (28.1%) respectively, clinical benefit (CR+PR+SD) was recorded in 50% of patients while PD was observed in 16 (50%) patients. In regard to survival, the median value of OS was 10.5months (range, 2.2-17.5months). The median value of PFS was 6.37months (range, 1-17.5months). The one-year OS rate was 34.4% and the one-year PFS rate was 12.5%. Concerning hematological toxicity grade 3 neutropenia was recorded in 4 (12.5%) patients while grade 4 febrile neutropenia was recorded in 2 (6.3%) patients and grade 4 anemia was represented by 3.1%. Grade 1-2 fatigue was the most common non-hematological toxicity and represented by 65.6% of patients. Grade 3 non hematological toxicity was recorded with nausea/vomiting and hepatic toxicity represented by 3.1% for both. CONCLUSION: The GEMOX combination is a regimen with a moderate therapeutic efficacy and tolerable toxic side effects in patients with platinum-resistant EOC.
