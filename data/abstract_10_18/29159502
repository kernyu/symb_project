The increasing incidence of fungal infections and antifungal resistance has prompted the search for novel antifungal drugs and alternative agents. We explored the antifungal activity of Myrtus communis essential oil (EO) against Malassezia sp. isolated from the skin of patients with pityriasis versicolor. These broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities of M. communis EO and its potent inhibiting activity on Malassezia growth deserve further research with aim to considerate this EO as candidate for topical use in treatment of skin diseases.
