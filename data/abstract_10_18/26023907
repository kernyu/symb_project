OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to determine whether the current antibiotic regimen for preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) is adequate for covering the current causative agents and sensitivities of chorioamnionitis and early-onset neonatal sepsis. STUDY DESIGN: During a 3-year period, we retrieved the results from placental and amniotic membrane cultures obtained at delivery in cases of maternal fever, chorioamnionitis, and PPROM, and from blood cultures obtained from neonates with early-onset sepsis (EOS) in three participating hospitals. Sensitivity of pathogens to antimicrobial agents was performed using routine microbiologic techniques. RESULTS: There were 1,133 positive placental or amniotic cultures, 740 (65.3%) were from gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae. There were 27 neonates diagnosed with EOS with positive blood cultures. Aerobic Enterobacteriaceae accounted for 14 cases (52%) and group B streptococcus for 7 cases (26%). Of the Escherichia coli and Klebsiella sp., only 38% were sensitive to ampicillin. CONCLUSION: Local pathogens and their antibiotic sensitivity profiles should be explored every few years and an effective antibiotic protocol chosen to cover the main pathogens causing chorioamnionitis and EOS. Consideration should be made for changing ampicillin in women with PPROM to a regimen with better coverage of gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae.
