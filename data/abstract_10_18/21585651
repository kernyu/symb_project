Expression of the alcohol dehydrogenase gene ADH1, which converts ethanol into carcinogenic acetaldehyde, significantly inversely correlated with the expression of CDR1 and CDR2, genes linked to azole resistance in Candida albicans isolated from chronic oral candidosis in autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidosis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED, APS-I) patients. This is a novel link between candidal two-carbon metabolism genes and azole resistance.
