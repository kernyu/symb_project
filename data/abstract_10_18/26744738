Daclatasvir is a nonstructural protein 5A inhibitor of hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication. Asunaprevir is an NS3/4A complex inhibitor of HCV replication. The combination of daclatasvir and asunaprevir has been approved in Japan for the treatment of genotype 1 chronic HCV infection. In vitro studies have documented potent activity of these drugs, individually and in combination, against genotype 1 HCV. Results from completed and ongoing clinical studies have confirmed this potent activity in patients, with better responses noted in genotype 1b patients compared to patients with genotype 1a HCV. Response rates are also better in treatment-naive patients compared to those who are treatment-experienced; in these cases, the addition of interferon and ribavirin appears to enhance the treatment response. The combination of daclatasvir and asunaprevir is, in general, well tolerated. Daclatasvir and asunaprevir are substrates for cytochrome P450 3A4 enzymatic pathway; thus, there is a substantial potential for drug interactions.
