The intractability of bacterial resistance presents a dilemma for therapies against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) infection. Effective anti-virulence strategies are urgently needed, reflecting the proliferation of resistant strains. Inhibitors of sortase A (SrtA), enzymes that anchor virulence-related surface proteins, are regarded as promising candidates for countermeasures against bacterial infections. In the present study, the inhibitory effect of dryocrassin ABBA (ABBA) against SrtA and its molecular basis has been examined. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays were used to determine the inhibitory activity of ABBA against SrtA. To identify the mechanism underlying this activity, molecular dynamics simulations and mutagenesis assays were applied, and the results revealed that the direct engagement of SrtA via ABBA through binding to V166 and V168 significantly attenuated the catalytic activity of SrtA. Taken together, these findings indicated that ABBA is a potential novel antimicrobial agent for S. aureus infection via targeting SrtA.
