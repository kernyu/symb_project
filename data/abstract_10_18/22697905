Macrolide antibiotics, like erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin, possess anti-inflammatory properties. These properties are considered fundamental to the efficacy of these three macrolides in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases like diffuse panbronchiolitis and cystic fibrosis. However, long-term treatment with macrolide antibiotics presents a considerable risk for promotion of bacterial resistance. We have examined antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects of a novel macrolide class: N'-substituted 2'-O,3'-N-carbonimidoyl bridged erythromycin-derived 14- and 15-membered macrolides. A small focused library was prepared, and compounds without antimicrobial activity, which inhibited IL-6 production, were selected. Data analysis led to a statistical model that could be used for the design of novel anti-inflammatory macrolides. The most promising compound from this library retained the anti-inflammatory activity observed with azithromycin in lipopolysaccharide-induced pulmonary neutrophilia in vivo. Importantly, this study strongly suggests that antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities of macrolides are independent and can be separated, which raises development plausibility of novel anti-inflammatory therapeutics.
