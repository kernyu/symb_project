The ability of acycloguanosine H-phosphate to inhibit the reproduction of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) variants, including its acycloguanosine (acyclovir)-resistant ones, was studied. Acycloguanosine H-phosphate-resistant HSV-1 variants were obtained. It was found that these variants were cross-resistant to thymidine kinase-dependent HSV reproduction inhibitors, but preserved sensitivity to Apa-A and phosphonoacetic acid.
