As increasing drug-resistance poses an emerging threat to public health, the development of novel antibacterial agents is critical. We developed a workflow consisting of various methods for de novo design. In the workflow, 2D-QSAR model based on molecular fingerprints was constructed to extract the bioactive molecular fingerprints from a data set of DNA-gyrase inhibitors with new structure and mechanism. These fingerprints were converted into molecular fragments which were recombined to generate compound library. The new compound library was virtually screened by LigandFit and Gold docking, and the results were further investigated by pharmacophore validation and binding mode analysis. The workflow successfully achieved a potential DNA-gyrase inhibitor. It could be applied to design more novel potential DNA-gyrase inhibitors and provide theoretical basis for further optimization of the hit compounds.
