We retrospectively evaluated the distribution of clinical Candida spp. isolated over a 5-year period in our hospital relative to year, specimen types, hospital departments and their antifungal susceptibility patterns. Overall 3,756 Candida spp. were recovered from 10,857 specimens. In vitro antifungal susceptibility tests were conducted with 2,068 isolates against amphotericin B, fluconazole and itraconazole using the Etest method. C. albicans was isolated frequently from non-sterile body specimens while non-C. albicans Candida spp. were commonly recovered from sterile body specimens. Isolation rates of C. albicans were 83%, 61.2% and 49% in non-sterile body specimens, sterile body specimens and blood-sterile body fluids, respectively. C. krusei was an important isolate from specimens of patients in the Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation units and its rate of recovery increased in these departments. Amphotericin B resistance was detected in only seven C. krusei isolates, whereas 80% (n = 1,653), 76% (n = 1,572) and 99% (n = 2,061) of all isolates were susceptible to fluconazole, itraconazole and amphotericin B, respectively. In conclusion, the distribution of Candida species was variable among hospital departments and among body sites. These results may be useful in predicting potential fungal pathogens and the choice of antifungal treatment.
