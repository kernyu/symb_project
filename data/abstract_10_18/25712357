The development of antibacterial compounds that perturb novel processes is an imperative in the challenge presented by widespread antibiotic resistance. While many antibiotics target the ribosome, molecules that inhibit ribosome assembly have yet to be used in this manner. Here we show that a novel inhibitor of ribosome biogenesis, lamotrigine, is capable of rescuing Caenorhabditis elegans from an established Salmonella infection, revealing that ribosome biogenesis is a promising target for the development of new antibiotics.
