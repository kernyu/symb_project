OBJECTIVE: Trachyspermum ammi (T. ammi) has been known as having many therapeutic properties and its antimicrobial activity has currently received a renewed interest. This study aimed to verify the effectiveness of T. ammi essential oil to inhibit the growth of Candida albicans (C. albicans) strains isolated from HIV(+) patients with oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The essential oil was obtained by hydrodistillation in a Clevenger apparatus and analyzed by gas chromatography. Susceptibility tests were expressed as inhibition zone by the disk diffusion method and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) by the broth microdilution method. RESULTS: Thymol (63.4%), p-cymene (19%) and gamma-terpinen (16.9%) were found as the most abundant constituents. The disk diffusion results revealed that 67% of oral C. albicans isolates were susceptible, 9% susceptible-dose dependent and 24% resistant to fluconazole. In the broth microdilution method, 68% of isolates were susceptible, 5% susceptible-dose dependent and 27% resistant to fluconazole. The increase in concentration led to a significant reduction in yeasts that were growing in exponential phase. In addition, with increasing in T. ammi oil concentration, the time of remaining cells in lag phase was significantly increased. CONCLUSION: This study showed that all clinical C. albicans isolates were susceptible to T. ammi essential oil, indicating a significant reduction in the yeast growth in exponential phase.
