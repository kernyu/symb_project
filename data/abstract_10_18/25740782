DNA sequencing of rpoB and culture-based drug susceptibility results were evaluated for samples referred for confirmation of rifampin resistance detected by the Cepheid Xpert MTB/RIF assay. Silent mutations and mutations associated with low-level resistance were found in the study population. These data support CDC recommendations to confirm Xpert rifampin resistance results.
