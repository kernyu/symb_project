It was found by virtual screening that 3-amino-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]quinolines could have wide protein kinase inhibitory activity. Amides of titled amines and thioureas were synthesized regioselectively. 3-Amino-7-methoxy-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]quinoline demonstrated in vitro significant inhibitory activity on bacterial serine/threonine protein kinases (inhibition of resistance to kanamycin in Streptomyces lividans regulated by protein kinases). The studies of Structure Activity Relationship (SAR) showed that the substitution of the NH2 group and 1-NH of pyrazole ring or aromatic ring at the position 6 decreased or removed inhibitory activity.
