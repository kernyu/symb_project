BACKGROUND: Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is an established treatment modality for end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Peritonitis remains a serious complication in PD patients and an important cause of drop-out from the program. Types of pathogens and their drug resistance patterns may determine the outcome of peritonitis. The present study was undertaken to determine the microbiology of peritonitis in PD patients, antibiotic resistance in commonly isolated bacterial pathogens and clinical outcomes. METHOD: We enrolled 211 patients with ESRD undergoing PD who developed peritonitis during 2002 to 2011. PD fluids were cultured and antibiotic susceptibility test of the bacterial isolates was performed. RESULT: A total of 303 peritonitis episodes with an overall incidence of 0.41 episodes per patient-year were recorded. Gram-positive, gram-negative, fungi, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and >/= 2 organisms were isolated from 102 (33.7%), 89 (29.4%), 41 (13.5%), 11 (3.6%) and five (1.6%) episodes respectively; 55 (18.2%) episodes were culture negative. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (CONS) was the most common isolate. Catheter loss and hospital admission in gram-negative peritonitis were significantly higher than in gram-positive peritonitis (36/89 (40.4%) vs 20/102 (19.6%), p < 0.001; and 56/89 (62.9%) vs 42/102 (41.2%), p = 0.004 respectively). Antibiotic susceptibility tests showed 54.3% of Enterobacteriaceae isolates were extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers, 23.5% of Acinetobacter species and 11.5% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) producers; 15.4% of enterococci and 28.6% of staphylococci were resistant to vancomycin and methicillin respectively. Mortality was significantly higher in patients having peritonitis due to vancomycin-resistant enterococci, ESBL- and MBL-producing bacteria. CONCLUSION: Emerging antimicrobial resistance calls for prompt diagnosis and aggressive empiric therapy based on the local sensitivity data.
