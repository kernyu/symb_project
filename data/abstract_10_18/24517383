The aim of the study was to investigate the molecular epidemiology of 87 third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Escherichia coli (3GC-R Ec) from bloodstream infections in Denmark from 2009. Sixty-eight of the 87 isolates were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers, whereas 17 isolates featured AmpC mutations only (without a coexpressed ESBL enzyme) and 2 isolates were producing CMY-22. The majority (82%) of the ESBL-producing isolates in our study were CTX-M-15 producers and primarily belonged to phylogroup B2 (54.4%) or D (23.5%). Further, one of the two CMY-22-producing isolates belonged to B2, whereas only few of the other AmpCs isolates belonged to B2 and D. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed that both clonal and nonclonal spread of 3GC-R Ec occurred. ST131 was detected in 50% of ESBL-producing isolates. The remaining ESBL-producing isolates belonged to 17 other sequence types (STs), including several other internationally spreading STs (e.g., ST10, ST69, and ST405). The majority (93%) of the ESBL-producing isolates and one of the CMY-22-producing isolates were multiresistant. In conclusion, 3GC-R in bacteriaemic E. coli in Denmark was mostly due to ESBL production, overexpression of AmpC, and to a lesser extent to plasmid-mediated AmpC. The worldwide disseminated CTX-M-15-ST131 was strongly represented in this collection of Danish, bacteriaemic E. coli isolates.
