Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a diverse public health complication and are caused by range of pathogens, however most often by Gram negative bacteria which cause significant life threatening risks to different populations. The prevalence rate and antimicrobial resistance among the Gram negative uropathogens alarmed to significantly heighten the economic burden of these infections. In this study, we investigated the role of Pyrrolo[1,2-a] pyrazine-1,4-dione,hexahydro-3-(2-methylpropyl) on endophytic actinomycetes Nocardiopsis sp. GRG 1 (KT235640) exhibit the antibiofilm effect against P. mirabilis and E. coli and it was characterized through activity guided techniques using TLC, HPLC, GC-MS, LC-MS and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The compound, Pyrrolo [1, 2-a] pyrazine-1, 4-dione, hexahydro-3-(2-methylpropyl) inhibits P. mirabilis biofilm formation as well as reduce the viability of preformed biofilms. Furthermore, CLSM image show the, cell shrinkage, disorganization of cell membrane and loss of viability with cell membrane damage. The SEM result confirms that the cell wall degradation against virulent of biofilm forming bacteria. Hence, the Pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazine-1,4-dione, hexahydro-3-(2-methylpropyl) is active against P. mirabilis and E. coli.
