OBJECTIVES: To describe our experience and clinical outcomes with the management of pediatric tympanostomy tube otorrhea secondary to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). METHODS: Retrospective review of pediatric patients (age <18) diagnosed with culture-positive MRSA tympanostomy tube otorrhea. RESULTS: MRSA positive ear cultures in the presence of tympanostomy tubes were identified in 41 patients (6.3%). The average age was 2.9 years old. In all cases, culture results indicated sensitivity to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and gentamicin; resistance to fluoroquinolones and clindamycin occurred in 87.8% and 61.0% of cases, respectively. Fluoroquinolone and sulfacetamide ototopical medications were found to be associated with successful otorrhea resolution (p=0.005 and 0.009, respectively). Adjunctive therapy with oral antibiotics, bactrim and clindamycin (p=0.172 and 0.877, respectively), did not improve resolution rates with medical treatment. Tympanostomy tube removal was more successful than medical therapy alone (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: Appropriately treated recurrent or recalcitrant tympanostomy tube-related otorrhea should raise the suspicion for MRSA-related tympanostomy tube otorrhea. Fluoroquinolone ototopical medication should be considered for initial therapy. Sulfacetamide ototopical medication can be considered for failures. The adjunctive use of oral antibiotics, bactrim and clindamycin, and aminoglycoside ototopical medications did not improve clinical outcomes for medical therapy alone. We believe that some consideration be given to removal of the tympanostomy tube with or without replacement, after an initial treatment period with fluoroquinolone and/or sulfacetamide otopical medications. Our findings seem to suggest an improved rate with tympanostomy tube removal over medical therapy alone (p<0.0001). No standard management guidelines currently exist.
