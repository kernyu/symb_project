BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: There is an increasing frequency of resistance of Campylobacter jejuni to antimicrobial agents making treatment difficult. In this study, the in vitro susceptibility of C. jejuni isolates collected over an eight year period was tested against tigecycline, a glycylcycline, the previously tested antimicrobial agents in Kuwait, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin and tetracycline, and other antimicrobial agents not previously tested in Kuwait, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, gentamicin, imipenem and meropenem. METHODS: A total of 97 C. jejuni isolates from diarrhoeal stools of Kuwaiti patients during 2002-2010 were studied for susceptibility to the above antimicrobial agents by E test. RESULTS: Erythromycin resistance increased from 5.0 per cent in 2002-2003 to 13.8 per cent in 2007-2010. The figures for ciprofloxacin resistance for the same periods were 53 and 65.5 per cent, respectively. Tetracycline resistance increased from 40.0 per cent in 2003-2006 to 62.1 per cent in 2007-2010 (P=0.05). However, all isolates were uniformly susceptible to tigecycline and other antimicrobial agents. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: There was a progressive increase in the prevalence of resistance to ciprofloxacin, erythromycin and tetracycline. As all isolates were uniformly susceptible to tigecycline, this antimicrobial agent can be considered as a potential candidate for treatment in clinical studies.
