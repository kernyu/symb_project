We have recently demonstrated that an attenuated strain of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium unable to synthesize the zinc transporter ZnuABC (S. Typhimurium DeltaznuABC), is able to protect mice against systemic and enteric salmonellosis and is safe in pigs. Here, we have tested the protective effects of S. Typhimurium DeltaznuABC in pigs. Resistance to challenge with the fully virulent strain S. Typhimurium ATCC 14028 was assessed in animals vaccinated with S. Typhimurium DeltaznuABC (two dosages tested), in controls vaccinated with a formalin-inactivated virulent strain and in unvaccinated controls. Clinical signs of salmonellosis, faecal shedding and bacterial colonization of organs were used to assess vaccine-induced protection. After the challenge, pigs vaccinated with the attenuated S. Typhimurium DeltaznuABC strain did not display clinical signs of salmonellosis (fever or diarrhoea). The vaccine also reduced intestinal tract colonization and faecal shedding of the fully virulent Salmonella strain, as compared to control groups. S. Typhimurium DeltaznuABC represents a promising candidate vaccine against salmonellosis in pigs.
