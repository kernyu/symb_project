OBJECTIVES: To describe the microbiology, antimicrobial susceptibility of patients proven prosthetic joint infection (PJI) after primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA)and to provide reference for the diagnosis and treatment of this complication. METHODS: The medical data of the patients with infected knee arthroplasty, who were managed with revision surgery between January 1995 to December 2011 were reviewed. Twenty-nine cases were identified and majority of the patients were female (23/29). Diagnosis of PJI after primary TKA was between 1 week and 10 years (average 24.3 months). The microbiology and antimicrobial susceptibility were analyzed. RESULT: The overall positive rate of cultures was 65.5% (19/29). The most common organisms identified were Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CNS) (7/19) and Staphylococcus Aureus (SA) (5/19). Rare pathogens of Mycobacterium (2/19) and fungi (1/19) were also identified. Vancomycin was the most effective antibiotics with overall sensitivity rates of 100%.Resistant and rare pathogens were all in type IV infection. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-positive bacterias are the main pathogen, resistant and rare pathogens should be payed attention to. Antibiotic treatment for infected TKA should be based on the results of drug susceptibility. Vancomycin allows infected knee arthroplasties before the result.
