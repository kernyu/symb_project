OBJECTIVES: To describe the phenotypic and genetic characteristics of the first two cases of extended-spectrum cephalosporin (ESC)-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae in South Africa, one of which was associated with verified cefixime treatment failure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two ESC-resistant N. gonorrhoeae isolates were cultured from the urethral discharge of two men who have sex with men (MSM). One man reported a persistent urethral discharge that had failed to respond to previous therapy with oral cefixime. Agar dilution MICs were determined for eight antibiotics. beta-Lactam-associated resistance mutations were identified through PCR-based amplification and sequencing for several key genes: penA, mtrR and its promoter, porB1b (penB), ponA and pilQ. For molecular epidemiological characterization, full-length porB gene sequencing, N. gonorrhoeae multiantigen sequence typing (NG-MAST) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were performed. RESULTS: Both isolates were resistant to cefixime, ciprofloxacin, penicillin and tetracycline and intermediate/resistant to azithromycin, but susceptible to ceftriaxone, gentamicin and spectinomycin. Both isolates had the type XXXIV penA mosaic allele in addition to previously described resistance mutations in the mtrR promoter (A deletion), porB1b (penB) (G101K and A102N) and ponA1 (L421P). Both isolates had an identical NG-MAST sequence type (ST4822) and MLST sequence type (ST1901). CONCLUSIONS: Both isolates were resistant to cefixime and possessed a number of identical mutations in key genes contributing to ESC resistance in N. gonorrhoeae. The two isolates contained the type XXXIV penA mosaic allele and belonged to a successful international MSM-linked multidrug-resistant gonococcal clone (MLST ST1901) associated with several cefixime treatment failures in Europe and North America.
