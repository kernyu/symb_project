Gram-positive microorganisms are one of leading pathogenic microorganisms in public health, including several typical "Super Bugs" as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, which caused a increasement of infections, clinical failures and expenses. Regarded as a common genetic element responsible for horizontal gene transfer, integrons are widely distributed in various pathogens considered as a determinant in the acquisition and evolution of antibiotic resistance. Current investigations mainly focus on the distribution of integrons in Gram-negative microorganisms, while the role of integron in antibiotic resistance among Gram-positive microorganisms remains unclear and need investigation. To date, the surveillances of integrons in Gram-positive microorganism have been widely conducted in clinic, community even husbandry. China remains one of the worst country in antibiotics abuse worldwide and considered as a potential area for the prevalence of antimicrobial microorganisms and the occurrence of various 'Super Bugs'. Recently, the surveillance of the occurrence of integron and resistance gene cassettes was conducted in South China during the first 10 years of the 21st century. Referred to the surveillance in South China and other investigation in Asian countries, this review aims to summarize the occurrence, pathogenicity and virulence mediated by integrons in typical Gram-positive microorganisms (Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, Corynebacterium and Streptococcus) and the role of integrons in antibiotic resistance.
