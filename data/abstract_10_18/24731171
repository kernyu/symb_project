Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease that is accelerated in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Individuals with HIV infection have an activated type I interferon (IFN) monocyte phenotype, which may enhance uptake of modified low-density lipoprotein (LDL) thereby initiating a prefoam cell pathology and recruitment into atherosclerotic plaques. In a sampling of HIV-infected subjects, an increase in monocyte activation genes, MX1 and CXCL10, correlated with monocyte expression of the scavenger receptor A (SR-A), a major receptor for lipid uptake and foam cell formation. Monocytes from HIV-infected subjects accumulated more lipid than control uninfected subjects. We modeled increased activation in HIV infection by priming human monocytes with IFNalpha followed by exposure to acetylated LDL (acLDL). Exposure to IFNalpha increased acLDL uptake, which generated increased cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). We posit that HIV infection augments formation of arterial plaques by triggering monocyte activation with a type I IFN profile, which induces SR-A expression, lipid uptake, and subsequent ROS production. These findings may explain in part why HIV-infected individuals with chronic immune activation have an increased risk of atherosclerosis.
