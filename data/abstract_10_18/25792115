BACKGROUND: In recent years, the rising rates of resistance to antimicrobial drugs among pathogens have caused great difficulty for clinicians treating infectious diseases. The aim of the study was to assess the curative effect of fosfomycin in treating urinary tract infections (UTIs) in China. METHODS: We collected clinical isolates of UTIs to determine their susceptibility to fosfomycin by the agar dilution method and to analyze extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing isolates by the double-disc method on Mueller-Hinton agar. Fosfomycin-modifying enzyme analysis was conducted by PCR. Differences between the different groups were determined by the chi(2) test. RESULTS: We collected 433 UTI isolates, and the result showed that the susceptibility rates of clinical isolates were all above 80%. Only Klebsiella pneumoniae was fosA positive, with a positive rate of 26.7%. No correlation was found for the resistance between the antibiotic drugs tested and fosfomycin in the other bacteria, except for cefepime, levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin in Enterobacter cloacae and imipenem in K. pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that fosfomycin may be a suitable antimicrobial agent for UTI isolates and ESBL-producing bacteria in our hospital.
