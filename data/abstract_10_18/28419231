The major targets for antibiotics in staphylococci are (i) the cell envelope, (ii) the ribosome and (iii) nucleic acids. Several novel targets emerged from recent targeted drug discovery programmes including the ClpP protease and FtsZ from the cell division machinery. Resistance can either develop by horizontal transfer of resistance determinants encoded by mobile genetic elements viz plasmids, transposons and the staphylococcal cassette chromosome or by mutations in chromosomal genes. Horizontally acquired resistance can occur by one of the following mechanisms: (i) enzymatic drug modification and inactivation, (ii) enzymatic modification of the drug binding site, (iii) drug efflux, (iv) bypass mechanisms involving acquisition of a novel drug-resistant target, (v) displacement of the drug to protect the target. Acquisition of resistance by mutation can result from (i) alteration of the drug target that prevents the inhibitor from binding, (ii) derepression of chromosomally encoded multidrug resistance efflux pumps and (iii) multiple stepwise mutations that alter the structure and composition of the cell wall and/or membrane to reduce drug access to its target. This review focuses on development of resistance to currently used antibiotics and examines future prospects for new antibiotics and informed use of drug combinations.
