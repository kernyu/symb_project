OBJECTIVE: To investigate the survival ability of Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) wildtype (WT), saeRS mutant (SAE) and saeRS complementary (SAEC) strains under different concentrations of glucose. METHODS: We measured the survival ability, biofilm forming ability, medium acidity and antimicrobial susceptibility of S. epidermidis in medium containing different concentrations of glucose. RESULTS: Compared with WT, the survival ability, biofilm forming ability and resistance to antibiotics (such as penicillin, oxacillin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and amikacin) of saeRS mutant increased significantly in response to glucose. SAE and SAEC showed the strongest survival ability and biofilm forming ability when grown in medium containing 14 mmol/L glucose and 28 mmol/L, respectively. WT showed no significant different survival and biofilm forming abilities when cultured with various concentrations of glucose. The medium acidity of saeRS mutant (pH=8.07) was lower than the WT (pH=7.0) in the presence of 14 mmol/L glucose. CONCLUSION: SaeRS may influence the survival ability of S. epidermidis by affecting glucose utilization.
