The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of biocide-resistant determinants and the susceptibility to chlorhexidine in high-level mupirocin-resistant, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MuH MRSA). Fifty-three MuH MRSA isolates were analyzed for plasmid-borne genes (qacA/B, smr, qacG, qacH, and qacJ) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR); for chromosome-mediated genes (norA, norB, norC, mepA, mdeA, sepA, and sdrM) by PCR and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR); and for susceptibility to chlorhexidine by MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). Furthermore, disinfectant efficacy was tested in the presence of 3.0% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in MBC detection. The plasmid-borne genes qacA/B (83.0%) and smr (77.4%) and overexpressions of chromosome-mediated genes norA (49.0%) and norB (28.8%) were predominantly found in isolates studied, and 90.6% of the isolates revealed tolerance to chlorhexidine. In the presence of BSA, the average MBC of chlorhexidine for these isolates rose to 256 mug/mL. Altogether, our results suggest that surveillance of sensitivity to biocides among MuH MRSA isolates is essential for hospital infection control.
