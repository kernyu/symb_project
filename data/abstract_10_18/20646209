Escherichia coli OmpT, located in the outer membrane, has been characterized as a plasminogen activator, with the ability to hydrolyze protamine and block its entry. In this investigation, a complex of low molecular weight cationic peptides purified from human urine by a combination of membrane ultrafiltration and weak cation exchange chromatography was characterized. The impact of OmpT on E. coli resistance to urinary cationic peptides was investigated by testing ompT knockout strains. The ompT mutants were more susceptible to urinary cationic peptides than ompT(+) strains, and this difference was abolished by complementation of the mutants with pUC19 carrying the ompT gene. The urinary protease inhibitor ulinastatin greatly decreased the resistance of the ompT(+) strains. Overall, the data indicate that OmpT may help E. coli persist longer in the urinary tract by enabling it to resist the antimicrobial activity of urinary cationic peptides.
