In the present study, a single and binary Ketoprofen-loaded mats of ultrathin fibers were developed by electrospinning and their physical properties and drug release capacity was analyzed. The single mat was prepared by solution electrospinning of poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) with Ketoprofen at a weight ratio of 5wt%. This Ketoprofen-containing PCL solution was also used as the oil phase in a 7:3 (wt/wt) emulsion with gelatin dissolved in acidified water. The resultant stable oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion of PCL-in-gelatin, also containing Ketoprofen at 5wt%, was electrospun to produce the binary mat. Cross-linking process was performed by means of glutaraldehyde vapor on the electrospun binary mat to prevent dissolution of the hydrophilic gelatin phase. The performed characterization indicated that Ketoprofen was successfully embedded in the single and binary electrospun mats, i.e. PCL and PCL/gelatin, and both mats showed high hydrophobicity but poor thermal resistance. In vitro release studies interestingly revealed that, in comparison to the single PCL electrospun mat, the binary PCL/gelatin mat significantly hindered Ketoprofen burst release and exhibited a sustained release capacity of the drug for up to 4days. In addition, the electrospun Ketoprofen-loaded mats showed enhanced attachment and proliferation of L929 mouse fibroblast cells, presenting the binary mat the highest cell growth yield due to its improved porosity. The here-developed electrospun materials clearly show a great deal of potential as novel wound dressings with an outstanding controlled capacity to release drugs.
