BACKGROUND: Although multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a major global health problem, there is a gap in programmatic treatment implementation. METHODS: This study describes MDR-TB treatment models in three countries--Peru, Russia and Lesotho-- using qualitative data collected over a 13-year period. RESULTS: A program analysis is presented for each country focusing on baseline medical care, initial implementation and program evolution. A pattern analysis revealed six overarching themes common to all three programs: 1) importance of baseline assessments, 2) early identification of key collaborators, 3) identification of initial locus of care, 4) minimization of patient-incurred costs, 5) targeted interventions for vulnerable populations and 6) importance of technical assistance and funding. Site commonalities and differences in each of these areas were analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: It is recommended that all programs providing MDR-TB treatment address these six areas during program development and implementation.
