This study demonstrates that the use of information from medical prescriptions is essential for understanding the dynamics of community bacterial resistance. The resulting analysis can also influence and help establish more adequate public health policies on the control and optimization of antimicrobial use. The article demonstrates the use of a logical model developed by the EUREQA project for acquisition, classification, interpretation, and analysis of data from prescriptions for oral antimicrobial use.
