Aspergillus fumigatus is the main mold causing invasive fungal infection that shows high mortality rates. Therapeutic failure and the increase in drug resistance make it necessary to explore alternative treatments for this infection. We have evaluated the efficacy of amphotericin B at 0.8 mg/kg or 0.3 mg/kg of body weight combined with 40 mg/kg of posaconazole against three A. fumigatus isolates in a murine model of disseminated infection. The combination of the polyene and the azole led to a greater increase in survival and a significantly greater reduction in tissue burden than monotherapies.
