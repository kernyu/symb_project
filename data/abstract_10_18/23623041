The presence of ciprofloxacin resistance commensal Escherichia coli (C-R-Ec) was determined for goats in the absence of selective pressure in Northern and Central Greece. The C-R-Ec was categorized in 3 groups with respect to their phenotypic resistance to other antibiotics as well as the carriage of antibiotic resistance genes. The first group consisted of 7 C-R-Ec that were found also resistant to tetracycline. Among them tet(B) (n = 7), qnr(S) (n = 7), and qnr(B) (n = 3) producers were identified by polymerase chain reaction. The second group consisted of 10 C-R-Ec that were found sensitive to all other antibiotics, and their phenotypic resistance to ciprofloxacin was not attributed to the presence of resistance genes. Finally, the third group consisted of 2 C-R-Ec also resistant to sulfamethoxazole. These strains were not carrying any transferable elements that contribute to resistance either to ciprofloxacin or to sulfamethoxazole. This is the first report of ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli isolated from goats in Greece.
