Gene mutation of Candida albicans is one of the main causes for azole drug resistance. Different types of variation play different roles in promoting the process of drug resistance. ERG series of gene mutations primarily affect the ergosterol synthesis pathway. When the regulatory factors TAC1 for CDR1 gene and Mrr1 for MDR1 gene generate mutations, the expression level of drug efflux pump protein in Candida albicans may be changed. In addition, gene copy number variation is also gaining attention. Therefore, the research of mutation resistance-associated genes has a positive meaning to explore the mechanism of drug resistance in Candida albicans.
