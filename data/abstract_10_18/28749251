INTRODUCTION: Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been widely adopted to control the HIV-1 infection successfully. HIV-1 integrase (IN) inhibitors are primary drugs in HAART regimens targeting integration step in the HIV-1 life cycle. However, due to the emergence of viral resistance and cross-resistance amongst drugs, there is a pressing need for new and potent IN inhibitors. This review covers the three patents describing spirocyclic and phosphate substituted quinolizine derivatives as novel HIV-1 IN inhibitors for the discovery of new anti-HIV-1 drug candidates. Areas covered: This review is focused on spirocyclic and phosphate substituted quinolizine derivatives bearing the same metal chelation scaffold as novel HIV-1 IN inhibitors. Expert opinion: Generally, privileged structure-based optimizations have emerged as an effective approach to discover newly antiviral agents. More generally, due to the similar Mg(2+) catalytic active centers of endoribonucleases, some divalent metal ion chelators were found to be versatile binders targeting multiple metalloenzymes. Therefore, privileged structure-based scaffold re-evolution is an important tactic to identify new chemotypes, to explore unknown biological activities, or to provide effective ligands for multiple targets by modifying the existing active compounds.
