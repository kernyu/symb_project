AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Rapamycin impairs glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Our previous study demonstrated that rapamycin significantly increases the production of gastric ghrelin, which is critical in the regulation of glucose metabolism. Here, we investigated whether ghrelin contributes to derangements of glucose metabolism induced by rapamycin. METHODS: The effects of rapamycin on glucose metabolism were examined in mice receiving ghrelin receptor antagonist or with Ghsr1a gene knockout. Changes in GLUT4, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (pS6) were investigated by immunofluorescent staining or western blotting. Related hormones were detected by radioimmunoassay kits. RESULTS: Rapamycin impaired glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity not only in normal C57BL/6J mice but also in both obese mice induced by a high fat diet and db/db mice. This was accompanied by elevation of plasma acylated ghrelin. Rapamycin significantly increased the levels of plasma acylated ghrelin in normal C57BL/6J mice, high-fat-diet-induced obese mice and db/db mice. Elevation in plasma acylated ghrelin and derangements of glucose metabolism upon administration of rapamycin were significantly correlated. The deterioration in glucose homeostasis induced by rapamycin was blocked by D: -Lys3-GHRP-6, a ghrelin receptor antagonist, or by deletion of the Ghsr1a gene. Ghrelin receptor antagonism and Ghsr1a knockout blocked the upregulation of JNK activity and downregulation of GLUT4 levels and translocation in the gastrocnemius muscle induced by rapamycin. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The current study demonstrates that ghrelin contributes to derangements of glucose metabolism induced by rapamycin via altering the content and translocation of GLUT4 in muscles.
