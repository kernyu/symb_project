Here, we determined the effect of bovine lactoferrin (bLF) on the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in Shigella . Using a microdilution method, the MIC was determined in the presence or absence of bovine lactoferrin (10 mg/mL) on 88 Shigella strains (56 Shigella flexneri , 15 Shigella boydii , 13 Shigella sonnei , and 4 Shigella dysenteriae ) previously isolated from peruvian children <2 years old. A fold change of 2 or more in MIC values was considered significant. For ampicillin, 67 (76%) strains were highly resistant; one-third of the strains (32%) showed a decrease in ampicillin MIC in the presence of LF. This was more typical of MIC values in less resistant strains. For 7 (8%) ampicillin-resistant strains, the decrease in the MIC resulted in the strains reaching the cutoff for susceptible in the presence of bLF. For trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 93% of the isolates (n = 82) were highly resistant and only 4 isolates (5%) decreased their MIC in the presence of bLF. None of the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistant strains became susceptible in the presence of LF. The decrease in the MIC in the presence of bLF seems to depend on the mechanisms of action of each antibiotic. In vivo studies are needed to further evaluate bLF as a coadjuvant to antibiotic treatment of resistant Shigella.
