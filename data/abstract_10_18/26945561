The genus Edwardsiella consists of bacteria with an intrinsic resistance to cyclic cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs). Edwardsiella ictaluri, a pathogen of the catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) and the causative agent of a systemic infection, is highly resistant to CAMPs. Previously, we determined that the oligo-polysaccharide (O-PS) of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) does not play a role in the E. ictaluri CAMP resistance and an intact core-lipid A structure is necessary for CAMPs resistance. Here, we evaluated the influence of the outer-core in the CAMPs resistance and fish virulence. E. ictaluri wabG, a gene that encodes for the UDP-glucuronic acid transferase that links the lipid A-inner-core to the outer-core-oligopolysaccharides, was deleted. Deletion of DeltawabG caused a pleiotropic effect, influencing LPS synthesis, CAMPs resistance, growth, and biofilm formation. E. ictaluri DeltawabG was attenuated in zebrafish indicating the important role of LPS during fish pathogenesis. Also, we evaluated the inflammatory effects of wabG LPS in catfish ligated loop model, showing a decreased inflammatory effect at the gut level respects to the E. ictaluri wild type. We conclude that E. ictaluri CAMPs resistance is related to the molecules present in the LPS outer-core and that fish gut inflammation triggered by E. ictaluri is LPS dependent, reinforcing the hypothesis that fish gut recognizes LPS in an O-PS dependent fashion.
