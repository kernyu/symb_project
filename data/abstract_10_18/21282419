We investigated the effect of N348I alone and with M184V on nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) drug susceptibility and replicative capacity in B and non-B HIV-1 isolates. N348I reduced the susceptibility to all NNRTI drugs across subtypes. The replication capacity of all viruses in a variety of cell lines was impaired by N348I. Interestingly, the N348I and M184V double mutation compensated for the reduced NNRTI drug susceptibility observed in the N348I single mutant and marginally improved viral replicative capacity.
