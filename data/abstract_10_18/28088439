Nosocomially-acquired multi-, extensively-, and pandrug resistant (MDR, XDR, and PDR) strains of microorganisms such as Acinetobacter baumannii remain a serious cause of infection and septic mortality in burn patients. Treatment of patients with nosocomial burn wound infections is often complicated by drug-resistant strains of A. baumannii. Today, many researchers are focusing on the investigation of novel non-antibiotic strategies such as photodynamic therapy (PDT). We report a new PDT strategy that suppresses colistin resistance in PDR A. baumannii by interfering with the expression of a pmrA/pmrB two-component system. In the current study, A. baumannii with a PDR feature isolated from a burn patient was used as a test strain. PDT was carried out using toluidine blue O (TBO) and light-emitting diode (LED) as a photosensitizer and radiation source, respectively. The antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were assessed for cells surviving PDT. The effects of sub-lethal PDT (sPDT) on the expression of the pmrA/pmrB two-component signal transduction system were evaluated by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Results of drug susceptibly testing (DST) in LED and TBO groups separately showed that the bacteria were resistant to all tested antibiotics, while the DST result of the LED+TBO group showed highly declining bacterial growth when compared with the control group. Reduction in the expression of pmrA and pmrB was observed in the treated strains after sPDT. This represents the first conclusive example of a direct role for the PDT in breaking antibiotic resistance by directly modulating two-component system activity.
