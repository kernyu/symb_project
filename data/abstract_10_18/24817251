Ethopabate is a veterinary drug used in the prophylaxis and treatment of coccidiosis in chickens. The presence of drug residues in edible tissues can be dangerous to human consumers. It may cause direct toxic effects, allergic reactions and increased bacterial resistance. A highly sensitive, simple and rapid spectrofluorimetric method was developed for the determination of ethopabate in its veterinary formulations. The proposed method is based on measuring the native fluorescence of ethopabate in water at 364 nm after excitation at 270 nm. The fluorescence-concentration plot was rectilinear over the range of 2-100 ng/mL, with a limit of detection of 2.9 ng/g and a limit of quantification of 9.8 ng/g for ethopabate. The method was successfully applied to the analysis of ethopabate in its commercial veterinary formulations and the results were in good agreement with those obtained with the reference method. The method was extended to the determination of ethopabate residues in chicken muscles and liver, and the results were satisfactory. The recoveries obtained were in the 108.36-113.42% range. No organic solvents are used in the procedure, so it can be considered a type of 'green' chemistry.
