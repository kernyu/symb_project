OBJECTIVES: Colistin susceptibility in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is associated with a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) structure that is controlled by the modulation of several two-component regulatory systems. In this study, we attempted to elucidate the role of these two-component systems in the development of colistin resistance in P. aeruginosa. METHODS: pmrA-, phoP-, parR- or cprR-inactivated mutants were constructed from a colistin-susceptible P5 strain. Colistin-resistant mutants (P5R, P5DeltapmrA-R, P5DeltaphoP-R, P5DeltaparR-R and P5DeltacprR-R) were developed in vitro from a wild-type strain (P5) and pmrA-, phoP-, parR- or cprR-inactivated mutants by serial passage in colistin-containing media. Expression levels of the pmrA, phoP, parR, cprR and arnB genes were determined and amino acid alterations of two-component regulatory systems during development of colistin resistance were also investigated. RESULTS: While P5DeltapmrA-R, P5DeltaparR-R and P5DeltacprR-R showed elevated expression of the phoP gene, the expression levels of the pmrA, parR and cprR genes were not different between gene-inactivated mutants and the adapted colistin-resistant mutants. P5DeltaphoP-R showed no significant elevation in expression of any of the pmrA, parR or cprR genes. The arnB gene was overexpressed in all in vitro-selected colistin-resistant mutants compared with colistin-susceptible wild-type and gene-inactivated mutants. Three amino acid alterations in PhoQ and three in ParS were identified in induced colistin-resistant mutants. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that individual two-component systems may not be essential for the acquisition of colistin resistance in P. aeruginosa. The PhoPQ two-component system may play a major role in the development of colistin resistance in our strains, but alternative or compensatory pathways may exist.
