Using Ttou 84 as starting point, a novel class of biphenyl derivatives of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine and imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine was designed to optimize the inhibitory properties on the replication of the bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Three sites of pharmacomodulation were chosen i.e. positions 2, 3 and 6 on the central heterocyclic core structure. From the 49 analogues tested, only compound 18j (3-(2'-hydroxybiphen-3-yl)-2-(2-methoxyphenyl)-6-(thien-3-yl)imidazo[1,2-b]pyrida zine) showed antiviral activity in the HCV replicon system reminiscent of selective inhibition (60-70% inhibition). Compound 4f (3-(biphen-3-yl)-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-phenylthioimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine) proved to be the most selective inhibitor of BVDV replication and showed no or only marginal cross-resistance with known inhibitors of pestivirus replication. The cross-resistance profile of 4f might indicate that 4f does not interact with the same binding site as BPIP, VP32947, AG110 or LZ37. From 42 analogues tested against both viruses, QSAR studies were discussed in regard to BVDV antiviral activity.
