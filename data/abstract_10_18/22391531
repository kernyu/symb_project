MK-6186 is a novel nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) which displays subnanomolar potency against wild-type (WT) virus and the two most prevalent NNRTI-resistant RT mutants (K103N and Y181C) in biochemical assays. In addition, it showed excellent antiviral potency against K103N and Y181C mutant viruses, with fold changes (FCs) of less than 2 and 5, respectively. When a panel of 12 common NNRTI-associated mutant viruses was tested with MK-6186, only 2 relatively rare mutants (Y188L and V106I/Y188L) were highly resistant, with FCs of >100, and the remaining viruses showed FCs of <10. Furthermore, a panel of 96 clinical virus isolates with NNRTI resistance mutations was evaluated for susceptibility to NNRTIs. The majority (70%) of viruses tested displayed resistance to efavirenz (EFV), with FCs of >10, whereas only 29% of the mutant viruses displayed greater than 10-fold resistance to MK-6186. To determine whether MK-6186 selects for novel resistance mutations, in vitro resistance selections were conducted with one isolate each from subtypes A, B, and C under low-multiplicity-of-infection (MOI) conditions. The results showed a unique mutation development pattern in which L234I was the first mutation to emerge in the majority of the experiments. In resistance selection under high-MOI conditions with subtype B virus, V106A was the dominant mutation detected in the breakthrough viruses. More importantly, mutant viruses selected by MK-6186 showed FCs of <10 against EFV or etravirine (ETR), and the mutant viruses containing mutations selected by EFV or ETR were sensitive to MK-6186 (FCs of <10).
