OBJECTIVES: To report an outbreak of invasive meningococcal disease from Meghalaya, in the north east India, from January 2008 through June 2009. METHODS: Retrospective review of case sheets was done. One hundred ten patients with invasive meningococcal disease were included for the study. RESULTS: Of the total patients, 61.8 % were boys and 38.2 % were girls (boy to girl ratio = 1.62:1). The average age of presentation was 8.48 +/- 5.09 y. Meningococcal meningitis was seen in 61.8 % of cases, meningococcemia in 20 % and 18.2 % had both. Fever was the most common manifestation (100 %) followed by meningeal signs (78.2 %), headache (56.4 %), vomiting (53.6 %), shock (38.2 %), low Glasgow coma scale (GCS) (25.5 %), purpura and rashes (23.6 %), seizures (9.1 %), abdominal symptoms (4.5 %), irritability and excessive crying (4.5 %) and bulging anterior fontanalle (23 %) in those below 18 mo of age. Raised intracranial pressure (ICP) was the most common complication (28.2 %) followed by coagulopathy (16.4 %), hepatopathy (10 %), herpes labialis (9.1 %), syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH) (8 %), pneumonia (7 %), arthritis (6 %), purpura fulminans, respiratory failure, sixth nerve palsy and diabetes insipidus in 4.5 % each, subdural empyema, optic neuritis, ARDS and ARF in 1.8 % each, cerebral salt wasting syndrome, third nerve palsy, cerebritis and hearing impairment in 0.9 % each. Culture was positive in 35.5 %. Patients were treated initially with ceftriaxone and dexamethasone but later on with chloramphenicol due to clinical drug resistance. Mortality was 6.4 %. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first epidemic report of invasive meningococcal disease from the north east India. Chloramphenicol acts well in areas with penicillin or cephalosporin resistance. Mortality reduces significantly with early diagnosis and prompt intervention.
