Multidrug resistance (MDR) remains the primary issue in cancer therapy, which is characterized by the overexpressed P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-included efflux pump or the upregulated anti-apoptotic proteins. In this study, a D-alpha-tocopheryl poly (ethylene glycol 1000) succinate (TPGS) and hyaluronic acid (HA) dual-functionalized cationic liposome containing a synthetic cationic lipid, 1,5-dioctadecyl-N-histidyl-L-glutamate (HG2C18) was developed for co-delivery of a small-molecule chemotherapeutic drug, paclitaxel (PTX) with a chemosensitizing agent, lonidamine (LND) to treat the MDR cancer. It was demonstrated that the HG2C18 lipid contributes to the endo-lysosomal escape of the liposome following internalization for efficient intracellular delivery. The TPGS component was confirmed able to elevate the intracellular accumulation of PTX by inhibiting the P-gp efflux, and to facilitate the mitochondrial-targeting of the liposome. The intracellularly released LND suppressed the intracellular ATP production by interfering with the mitochondrial function for enhanced P-gp inhibition, and additionally, sensitized the MDR breast cancer (MCF-7/MDR) cells to PTX for promoted induction of apoptosis through a synergistic effect. Functionalized with the outer HA shell, the liposome preferentially accumulated at the tumor site and showed a superior antitumor efficacy in the xenograft MCF-7/MDR tumor mice models. These findings suggest that this dual-functional liposome for co-delivery of a cytotoxic drug and an MDR modulator provides a promising strategy for reversal of MDR in cancer treatment.
