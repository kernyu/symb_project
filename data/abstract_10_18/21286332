Diagnostic laboratory data on antimicrobial susceptibility of Escherichia coli isolated from feces of spring calves were evaluated retrospectively for the 5-year period from 1999 to 2003. The antimicrobials to which resistance was most prevalent were tetracycline, ampicillin, and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole. Resistance to 3 or more antimicrobials was found in 52.5% [95% confidence interval (CI): 47.9 to 56.6] of the E. coli isolates. Incomplete records reduced the usefulness of the diagnostic laboratory data for surveillance. Standardized patient information submitted by veterinary clinics would increase the value of this data for surveillance.
