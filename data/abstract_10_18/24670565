A total of 60 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates collected from patients in prisons in Kazakhstan and 125 from the civilian sector were examined using mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units-variable number of tandem repeat analysis in 2012. The proportion of tuberculosis strains with unique genotypes isolated from the civilian patients was 50.4%, while that in the prison patients was 31.7%. This difference was statistically significant (chi(2) 4.42, P 0.035), and may reflect a low genetic diversity of M. tuberculosis strains isolated from prison patients. The frequencies of mutations in the rpoB531 and katG315 genes of the M. tuberculosis strains isolated from the civilians and in the penitentiary system were not significantly different (rpoB531: 82.4% vs. 88.3%, and katG315: 98.4% vs. 100%, respectively).
