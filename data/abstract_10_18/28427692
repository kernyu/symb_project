A 53-year-old woman was admitted to the department of neurology in Tenri Hospital because of progressive thoracic myelitis a month after she had eaten uncooked bovine liver. A previous episode of right optic neuritis and a positive test for serum anti-aquaporin-4 antibodies indicated a diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders. Although the patient initially recovered with the reduction of anti-aquaporin-4 antibodies during treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone infusion and plasma exchange, her neurological symptoms deteriorated soon after the completion of plasma exchange. Western blotting analysis detected anti-Toxocara canis antibodies in the serum; thus, the patient underwent oral albendazole treatment. This resulted in the alleviation of her symptoms. We therefore consider that rigorous investigation should be encouraged to detect rare pathogens including parasites in cases of treatment-resistant neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders.
