Bacteria contain small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that are responsible for altering transcription, translation or mRNA stability. ncRNAs are important because they regulate virulence factors and susceptibility to various stresses. Here, the regulation of a recently described ncRNA of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000, P16, was investigated. We determined that RpoS regulates the expression of P16. We found that deletion of P16 results in increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide compared to the wild-type strain, suggesting that P16 plays a role in the bacteria's susceptibility to oxidative stress. Additionally the P16 mutant displayed enhanced resistance to heat stress. Our findings provide new information on the regulation and role of this ncRNA in P. syringae.
