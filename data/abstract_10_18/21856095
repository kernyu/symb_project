A total of 315 samples of chicken (60), beef (144), minced meat (56), lamb meat (33), merguez (10) and fish (12) were collected from various local outlet stores in the area of "Grand Tunis", Tunisia between 2006 and 2008. Salmonella was recovered from 80 samples with the highest occurrence in chicken (48.3%) followed by beef (29.8%), minced meat (10.7%) and lamb (6.0%). No Salmonella were isolated from 12 fish and 10 merguez samples (typical Tunisian sausages). Nine serovars were identified among the isolates with the predominance of Salmonella Typhimurium (n=25) followed by Salmonella Kentucky (n=14), Salmonella Suberu (n=12) and Salmonella Zanzibar (n=11). Isolated Salmonella were characterized by serotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis, plasmid content and antimicrobial resistance profiling. Sixteen (20.0%) Salmonella isolates displayed resistance to ampicillin (13 isolates), streptomycin (five isolates), cefoperazone (two isolates), furazolodine (two isolates), with seven of these isolates displaying multiple resistance to at least two of these antimicriobal agents. PFGE analysis showed homogenous restriction patterns in each serovar. Compiled serotyping, PFGE analysis, plasmid profiling and antimicrobial resistance data provided additional discrimination.
