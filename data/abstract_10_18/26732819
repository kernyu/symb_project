Mycobacterium abscessus complex is an emerging pathogen in lung transplant candidates and recipients. M. abscessus complex is widespread in the environment and can cause pulmonary, skin and soft tissue, and disseminated infection, particularly in lung transplant recipients. It is innately resistant to many antibiotics making it difficult to treat. Herein we describe the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment of M. abscessus with an emphasis on lung transplant candidates and recipients. We also outline the areas where data are lacking and the areas where further research is urgently needed.
