BACKGROUND: Little is known about the natural history of Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) infection in women. We retrospectively tested archived vaginal fluid samples to assess MG prevalence, incidence, persistence, recurrence and antimicrobial resistance markers among women participating in the Preventing Vaginal Infections trial, a randomized trial of monthly presumptive treatment to reduce vaginal infections. METHODS: High-risk, nonpregnant, HIV-negative women aged 18-45 from Kenya and the US were randomized to receive metronidazole 750mg + miconazole 200mg intravaginal suppositories or placebo for 5 consecutive nights each month for 12 months. Clinician collected swabs containing cervicovaginal fluid were tested for MG using Hologic nucleic acid amplification testing at enrollment and every other month thereafter. Specimens that were MG+ underwent additional testing for macrolide resistance mediating mutations (MRMM) by DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Of 234 women enrolled, 221 had available specimens and 25 (11.3%) had MG at enrollment. Among 196 women without MG at enrollment, there were 52 incident MG infections (incidence=33.4 per 100 person-years). Smoking was independently associated with incident MG infection (adjusted HR=3.02; 95% CI 1.32, 6.93), and age <25 years trended towards an association (adjusted HR=1.70; 95% CI 0.95, 3.06). Median time to clearance of incident MG infections was 1.5 months (interquartile range 1.4, 3.0). Of the 120 MG+ specimens, 16 specimens from 15 different women were MRMM+ (13.3%), with no difference by country. CONCLUSIONS: M. genitalium infection is common among sexually active women in Kenya and the Southern US. Given associations between MG and adverse reproductive health outcomes, this high burden of M. genitalium in reproductive-aged women could contribute to substantial morbidity. SHORT SUMMARY: Using retrospective testing of archived specimens, a natural history study of Mycoplasma genitalium among Kenyan and US women reported a high prevalence (11.3%) and incidence of M. genitalium (33.4 per 100 person-years) of M. genitalium.
