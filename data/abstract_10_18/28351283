Objective To evaluate the performance of GeneXpert MTB/RIF in diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in China. Methods This cross-sectional study included sputum specimens of 240 suspected TB cases. Specimens were examined by light microscopy for the presence of acid-fast bacilli, which were cultured by the BACTEC MGIT 960 (M960) system and detected by the GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay. The positive rate, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and average turnaround time of methods were evaluated. Results The positive rate was 36.6% (87/238) for the GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay and 34.0% (81/238) by M960 culture, with no significant difference between methods (chi(2 )= 0.33, p > 0.05). According to culture results, sensitivity of the GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay was 84.0% (68/81), specificity was 87.8% (129/147), the PPV was 78.2% (68/87), and the NPV was 87.2% (129/148). The agreement for results between Gene Xpert MTB/RIF and the M960 system was 82.8% and the Kappa value was 0.73. Conclusion The GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay is a simple, rapid, and accurate test for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis in sputum specimens.
