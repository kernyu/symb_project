The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic background of methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) obtained from clinical specimens of inpatients and outpatients. Methicillin resistance was confirmed by the presence of the mecA gene by PCR. The genetic characterisation was performed using spa typing and the algorithm based upon repeat pattern (BURP). Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 68 and 79 inpatient and outpatient samples, 31 (46 %) and 14 (18 %) of which were MRSA, respectively. Among 37 inpatients and 65 outpatients with MSSA, 22 and 38 spa types were clustered into seven and eight spa-CCs, respectively. The main MSSA spa-CC of inpatients and outpatients was spa-CC015 (multilocus sequence typing (MLST) CC45). Most MRSA were associated with spa-CC355/595 (MLST CC152). MRSA-related background was found in 32 % of inpatients and 43 % of outpatients with MSSA, suggesting that MRSA did not arise from predominant MSSA clones.
