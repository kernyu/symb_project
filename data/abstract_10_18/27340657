Background. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESbetaLs) and AmpC beta-lactamases cause beta-lactam resistance in Escherichia coli. Fecal colonization by ESbetaL- and/or AmpC-positive E. coli is a source of nosocomial infections. Methods. In order to investigate inpatient fecal colonization by ESbetaLs and AmpC, antibiotic sensitivity tests were conducted and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using the disk diffusion method and E-test, respectively. Characterization of ESbetaL and AmpC was performed using E-test strips, and a set of PCRs and DNA sequence analyses were used to characterize the ESbetaL and AmpC genes. Results. The whole collection of E. coli isolates (n = 50) was sensitive to imipenem, tigecycline, colistin, and fosfomycin, while 26% of the isolates showed reduced susceptibility to ceftazidime (MIC >/= 4 mug/mL). ESbetaL was phenotypically identified in 26% (13/50) of cases, while AmpC activity was detected in two ESbetaL-producing E. coli isolates. All ESbetaL-producing E. coli were positive for the CTX-M gene, eleven isolates carried bla CTX-M-15, and two isolates carried bla CTX-M-14 gene. Two CTX-M-positive E. coli isolates carried bla CMY-2. Conclusions. The alimentary tract is a significant reservoir for ESbetaL- and/or AmpC-producing E. coli, which may lead to nosocomial infection.
