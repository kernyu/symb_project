Globally, about 4.5% of new tuberculosis (TB) cases are multi-drug-resistant (MDR), i.e. resistant to the two most powerful first-line anti-TB drugs. Indeed, 480,000 people developed MDR-TB in 2015 and 190,000 people died because of MDR-TB. The MDR Mycobacterium tuberculosis M family, which belongs to the Haarlem lineage, is highly prosperous in Argentina and capable of building up further drug resistance without impairing its ability to spread. In this study, we sequenced the whole genomes of a highly prosperous M-family strain (Mp) and its contemporary variant, strain 410, which produced only one recorded tuberculosis case in the last two decades. Previous reports have demonstrated that Mp induced dysfunctional CD8(+) cytotoxic T cell activity, suggesting that this strain has the ability to evade the immune response against M. tuberculosis. Comparative analysis of Mp and 410 genomes revealed non-synonymous polymorphisms in eleven genes and five intergenic regions with polymorphisms between both strains. Some of these genes and promoter regions are involved in the metabolism of cell wall components, others in drug resistance and a SNP in Rv1861, a gene encoding a putative transglycosylase that produces a truncated protein in Mp. The mutation in Rv3787c, a putative S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent methyltransferase, is conserved in all of the other prosperous M strains here analysed and absent in non-prosperous M strains. Remarkably, three polymorphic promoter regions displayed differential transcriptional activity between Mp and 410. We speculate that the observed mutations/polymorphisms are associated with the reported higher capacity of Mp for modulating the host's immune response.
