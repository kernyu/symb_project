The Russian Federation is a high-tuberculosis (TB)-burden country with high rates of drug resistance, including multidrug and extensive drug resistance to TB (M/XDRTB). Rapid diagnosis of resistance to fluoroquinolones (FQs) using molecular assays is essential for the implementation of appropriate drug regimens and prevention of the transmission of XDR strains. A total of 51 individual MDRTB strains were tested by pyrosequencing of the quinolone resistance determining region of the gyrA gene and the GenoType MTBDRsl assay (Hain Lifescience, GmbH, Nehren, Germany), and the results were evaluated against those obtained by phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST). Mutations were detected in 25 (78.1%) FQ-resistant strains, with the majority of mutations (n = 19 [73.0%]) found in codon 94 of the gyrA gene; the novel mutation 1457 C-->Tau was found in the gyrB gene. Three mixed allelic variants were detected, which is a well-known phenomenon in areas with high TB and drug-resistant TB rates. The sensitivity and specificity of pyrosequencing (86.2 and 100%, respectively) and MTBDRsl (86.2 and 100%, respectively) were high; however, the results for 5.9% of the analyzed strains were unreadable when MTBDRsl was used. The MTBDRsl and pyrosequencing assays offer a rapid and accurate means for diagnosing resistance to FQs in high-TB-burden areas.
