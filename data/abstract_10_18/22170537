Aciclovir (ACV)-resistant Herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2) infections are observed commonly in patients also infected with HIV-1. The use of foscarnet (FOS) in these patients may also lead to resistance. This situation can become a difficult therapeutic challenge. Four cases of patients infected with HIV and with mucocutaneous HSV-2 resistant to ACV and FOS are reported. These patients were treated successfully with topical 5% imiquimod. Imiquimod treatment also appeared to delay the time to recurrence of HSV lesions.
