In a background of high genomic HIV-1 variability with a predominance of CRF11_cpx and CRF22_01A1, we have studied the emergence of resistance mutations in isolates from Central African patients at failure of d4T-AZT/3TC/NVP-EFV plus two at failure of a PI-including regimen; the resistance mutations observed are those which are expected on HIV-1 subtype B.
