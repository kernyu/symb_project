Cadmium (Cd) pollution has aroused increasing attention due to its toxicity. It has been proved that Na(+)/H(+) Antiporter (NHX1) encodes a well-documented protein in Na(+)/H(+) trafficking, which leads to salt tolerance. This study showed that Glycine max Na(+)/H(+) Antiporter (GmNHX1) improved short-term cadmium and salt resistance in Lemna turionifera 5511. Expression of GmNHX1 prevented root from abscission and cell membrane damage, which also can enhance antioxidant system, inhibited of reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and cause a less absorption of Cd under cadmium and salt stress. The cadmium tolerance suggested that NHX1 was involved under the cadmium stress.
