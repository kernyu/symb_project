BACKGROUND: The inadequate use of antimicrobials contributes to the development of bacterial resistance, reduces the effectiveness of established treatments and increases costs and mortality due to infectious diseases. The aim of this article was to evaluate if the use of antimicrobials was carried out properly in hospitalized pediatric patients. METHODS: An epidemiological observational, cross-sectional study was carried out in UMAE-48 in Leon, Guanajuato. Sample was non-probabilistic by convenience with 60 % of expected adequate treatments, 4 standard deviation. Analysis of statistical distribution frequency technique was used by type of final grade of each treatment that was administered: adequate, justified, therapeutic, restricted and prophylactic. The test chi-square test for comparing of percentages. RESULTS: Antimicrobial therapy were evaluated 283 prescriptions in 217 patients, 53 % were men and 47 % women. The general treatment was adequate in 51.2 %, justified 66 %, therapeutic 53.4 %, 40.8 % restricted and 48% prophylactic. Comparison of percentages with statistical test of chi-square test, we found association with adequate treatment in neonates service (chi-square test 8.287; p 0.004) and inadequate treatment in preterm infants service (chi-square test 4.853; p 0.028) p < 0, 05. The most commonly used antimicrobials, 43.7 % penicillins and 37.1 % aminoglycoside. CONCLUSION: Only half of the treatments was antimicrobials are prescribed properly.
