Amantadine resistance has become increasingly common among recent seasonal influenza viruses. In addition, almost all pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses are resistant to this drug. Between 2007 and early 2009, the prevalence of oseltamivir-resistant seasonal H1N1 variants that possess the His274Tyr neuraminidase mutation had dramatically increased, raising concerns regarding the utility of oseltamivir. Fortunately, most of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses were sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors. In this paper, drug resistance among recent influenza virus isolates is comprehensively reviewed, especially from the standpoint of the molecular basis of drug resistance.
