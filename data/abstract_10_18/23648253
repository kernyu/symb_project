OBJECTIVE: To investigate the resistant mechanism of quinolones on multi-drug resistant Klebsiella caused pneumonia (MDR-KPN). METHODS: From August 2008 to May 2010, 47 strains of MDR-KPN were collected from 6 hospitals in Hangzhou and Huzhou in Zhejiang province in China. Drug target genes to quinolones (gyrA, parC) and quinolone-resistance genes mediated by mobile genetic elements [qnrA, qnrB, qnrS, aac (6')-Ib-cr, qepA] were analyzed by PCR and verified by DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Positive results were found in 47 strains of MDR-KPN, 43 strains (91.5%) of gyrA mutation, 40 strains (85.1%) of parC mutation, 3 strains (6.4%) of qnrB2, 1 strain (2.1%) of qnrB 4, 8 strains (17.0%) of qnrS 1, 5 strains (10.6%) of qnrS 4, 2 strains (4.3%) of aac (6')-Ib-cr respectively. Moreover, 5 novel variants of gyrA (GenBank accession number: JN811952, JN811953, JN811954, JN811955, JN811956), 5 novel variants of parC (GenBank accession number: JN817432, JN817433, JN817434, JN817435, JN817436) were also identified. In addition, qnrS4 (GenBank accession number: JN836269) appeared to be the novel variants of qnrS. CONCLUSION: Quinolone-resistance-determining region played a key role on the resistance to quinolones in this group of MDR-KPN, and quinolone-resistance genes mediated by mobile genetic elements [qnrB2, qnrB4, qnrS1, qnrS4, aac (6')-Ib-cr] showed positive in some parts of the strains. This was the first report on emergence of qnrS4 in the world.
