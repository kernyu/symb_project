We have sufficient knowledge and unprecedented access to global resources to dramatically reduce the transmission of HIV-1 from mother to children worldwide. Most transmission occurs during delivery and after birth through breastfeeding. For this reason, efforts to interrupt transmission have focused on peripartum period and safe infant feeding. This includes the use of antiretroviral therapy, elective cesarean section, avoidance of breastfeeding, and exclusive breastfeeding. This review summarizes recent studies and new international development on the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV should now be integrated as part of basic maternal and child health services.
