OBJECTIVE: To analyze the characteristics of hospital infection of hematological disease, so as to provide reference for clinical therapy. METHODS: Bacterial strains and antimicrobial resistance of patients with hospital infection in Department of Hematology, Peking University Third Hospital from Jan. 2011 to Dec. 2013 were identified and analyzed retrospectively. The specimens were from their blood, urine, sputum, throat swabs and etc. RESULTS: Among the total of 168 isolates of bacteria,the majority of the bacteria strains were from sputum (42.9%); 114 (67.9%) bacteria strains were gram negative and 54 (32.1%) bacteria strains were gram positive; the pathogen testing showed that 20.8% were Pseudomonas aeruginosa,18.5% Escherichia coli,17.9% Staphylococcus aureus, 9.5% Klebsiellar pneumonia, 5.9% Staphylococcus epidermis and 27.4% other bacteria; The gram negative bacilli to cefepime, amikacin and carbapenems showed the lowest antimicrobial resistance rates, and S. aureus showed the lowest antimicrobial resistance rates to vancomycin and linezolid. CONCLUSION: Patients with hemopathy are the main population of hospital infections, the gram negative bacteria are the most common pathogens.It is very important to promptly know the change in distribution of the pathogens in order to rationally select antibiotics and reduce the incidence of bacterial infections.
