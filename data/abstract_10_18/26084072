INTRODUCTION: A rapid growth of the antibiotic resistance among Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains was recently observed in many countries. The common resistance or decreased susceptibility to penicillin, tetracyclines, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin as well as emergence of the first strains resistant to ceftriakson and cefixim is a cause of an anxiety worldwide. Spectinomycin may constitute an alternative therapy of gonorrhoea except of pharyngeal infection. METHODS: The susceptibility to spectinomycin of 65 N. gonorrhoeae strains isolated in the second half of 2012 and the first half of 2013 in Dermatology and Venereology Clinic in Warsaw was investigated. The E-Tests (bioMerieux) were performed and the results (sensitive or resistant) were interpreted according to EUCAST and CLSI recommendations. RESULTS: The MIC (Minimal inhibitory concentration) values of spectinomycin for the investigated strains ranged from 4,0 mg/L to 32 mg/L, MIC50=16,0 mg/L and MIC=90=16,0 mg/L. It was shown that 100% of the strains was sensitive to spectinomycin according to EUCAST as well CLSI tables. CONCLUSIONS: High susceptibility of the investigated strains to spectinomycin suggests that the drug can be used in the therapy of the resistant gonorrhoea in monotherapy or combined with other drugs.
