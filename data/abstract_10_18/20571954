This study was performed to characterize the chromosomal metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) of Elizabethkingia meningoseptica isolated from Korea and to propose a clustering method of BlaB and GOB MBLs based on their amino acid similarities. Chromosomal MBL genes were amplified by PCR from 31 clinical isolates of E. meningoseptica. These PCR products were then cloned into a vector and electrotransformed into E. coli DH5 alpha. Nucleotide sequencing was performed by the dideoxy chain termination method using PCR products or cloned DNA fragments. Antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined by the agar dilution method. PCR experiments showed that all 31 E. meningoseptica isolates contained both the blaB and the bla (GOB) genes. DNA sequence analysis revealed that E. meningoseptica isolates possessed seven types of blaB gene, including five novel variants (blaB-9 to blaB-13) and 11 types of bla (GOB) gene, including 10 novel variants (bla (GOB-8) to bla (GOB-17)). The most common combination of MBL was BlaB-12 plus GOB-17 (n=19). Minimum inhibitory concentrations of imipenem and meropenem for the electrotransformants harboring novel BlaB and GOB MBLs were two- or four-fold higher than those for the recipient E. coli DH5 alpha. BlaB and GOB MBLs were grouped in three and six clusters including fifteen novel variants, respectively, based on amino acid similarities.
