INTRODUCTION: Bioactive peptides such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), ribosomally synthesized and post translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) and the non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs) have emerged with promising applications in medicine, agriculture and industry. However, their development has been limited by several difficulties making it necessary to search for novel discovery methods. In this context, proteomics has been considered a reliable tool. Areas covered: This review highlights recent developments in proteomic tools that facilitate the discovery of AMPs, RiPPs and NRPs as well as the elucidation of action mechanisms of AMPs and resistance mechanisms of pathogens to them. Expert commentary: Proteomic approaches have emerged as useful tools for the study of bioactive peptides, especially mass spectrometry-based peptidomics profiling, a promising strategy for AMP discovery. Furthermore, the rapidly expanding fields of genome mining and genome sequencing techniques, as well as mass spectrometry, have revolutionized the discovery of novel RiPPs and NRPs from complex biological samples.
