Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) is the most prevalent bacteria in the infections caused by burn, surgery, and traumatic injuries. Emergence of the P. aeruginosa bacterial resistance against various clinical drugs for wound treatment is the major concern nowadays. The present study describes the synthesis of the polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP) polymeric composite film (~0.2mm thickness) reinforced with the Cu/Zn bimetal-dispersed activated carbon micro/nanofiber (ACF/CNF), as a wound dressing material. The focus is on determining the efficacy of the prepared biomaterial against the multi and extensively drug-resistant P. aeruginosa strains isolated from the burning, surgical, and traumatic injury-wounds. The primary synthesis steps for the biomaterial include the mixing of a blend of CAP powder and the asymmetrically distributed Cu/Zn bimetals in ACF/CNF, into the polymerization reaction mixture of PVA. Biochemical tests showed that the prepared composite material significantly enhanced the in-vitro blood clotting rate, platelet aggregation, and macrophage cell proliferation, indicating the suitability of the material as a fast wound healer. The antibacterial tests performed against the P. aeruginosa strains showed that the material effectively suppressed the bacterial growth, with the bimetal nanoparticles dispersed in the material serving as an antibacterial agent. The PVA/CAP polymer composite served as an encapsulating agent providing a slow release of the nanoparticles, besides increasing the hemostatic properties of the biomaterial. The ACF/CNF served as a support to the dispersed bimetal nanoparticles, which also provided a mechanical and thermal stability to the material. Experimentally demonstrated to be biocompatible, the prepared metal-carbon-polymer nanocomposite in this study is an effective dressing material for the P. aeruginosa-infected wounds.
