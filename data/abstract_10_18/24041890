Triazoles are first-line agents for treating aspergillosis. The prevalence of azole resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus is increasing, and cross-resistance is a growing concern. In this study, the susceptibilities of 40 A. fumigatus clinical isolates were tested by using the CLSI method with amphotericin B, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, and the new triazole isavuconazole. Isavuconazole MICs were higher in strains with reduced susceptibilities to other triazoles, mirroring changes in voriconazole susceptibility. Isavuconazole MICs differed depending on the Cyp51A substitution.
