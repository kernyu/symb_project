Knowledge of the epidemiology of invasive fungal diseases in health care settings helps to establish the action levels necessary for its prevention. A first step is to identify groups of patients at high risk of invasive fungal diseases, establish accurate risk factors, observing the periods of greatest risk, and analyze the epidemiological profile in genera and species, as well as the patterns of antifungal resistance. Secondly, mechanisms to avoid persistent exposure to potential fungal pathogens must be established, protecting areas and recommending measures, such as the control of the quality of the air and water inside and outside the hospital, and determining and promoting appropriate architectural designs of health institutions. Finally, apart from the correct implementation of these measures, the use of antifungal prophylaxis should be considered in selected patients at very high risk, following the guidelines published.
