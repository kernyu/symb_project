PURPOSE: Inappropriate use of antibiotics is an important health problem that is related to increasing bacterial resistance. Despite its relevance, many health institutions assign very limited resources to improving prescribing practices. An antimicrobial stewardship programme (APS) centred on patients discharged from the ICU could efficiently undertake this task. METHODS: During this six month study the main activity was performing a programmed review of antimicrobial prescriptions in patients transferred to the ward from the ICU. In the case of inadequate antimicrobial treatment, a recommendation was included in the medical record. RESULTS: A total of 437 antimicrobial prescriptions for 286 patients were revised during a six month period. In all, 271 prescriptions (62%) were considered inappropriate in 183 patients. The most common reasons for inappropriateness were treating unconfirmed infection (43%), inadequate antimicrobial coverage (34%) and intravenous administration when the oral route was feasible (11%). Proposed recommendations were addressed in 212 cases (78%). There was no significant difference in adherence with respect to the type of recommendation (p=0.417). There was a 5% lower use of antibiotics during the year the study was conducted compared to the previous one. CONCLUSIONS: ASPs centred on patients discharged from the ICU may be an efficient strategy to ameliorate antimicrobial use in hospitals.
