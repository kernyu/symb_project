Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is a common pathogen infecting the majority of people worldwide at some stage in their lives. The early host response to viral infection is initiated by the cells of the innate immune response, including macrophages. Here, we have characterized the secretome of HSV-1-infected human primary macrophages using high-throughput quantitative proteomics. We identified and quantified 516 distinct human proteins with high confidence from the macrophage secretome upon HSV-1 infection, and the secretion of 411 proteins was >2-fold increased upon beta interferon (IFN-beta) priming and/or HSV-1 infection. Bioinformatics analysis of the secretome data revealed that most of the secreted proteins were intracellular, and almost 80% of the proteins whose secretion increased more than 2-fold were known exosomal proteins. This strongly suggests that nonclassical, vesicle-mediated protein secretion is activated in IFN-beta-primed and HSV-1-infected macrophages. Proteins related to immune and inflammatory responses, interferon-induced proteins, and endogenous danger signal proteins were efficiently secreted upon IFN-beta priming and HSV-1 infection. The secreted IFN-induced proteins include interferon-induced tetratricopeptide protein 2 (IFIT2), IFIT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), and myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA), implicating that these proteins also have important extracellular antiviral functions. Proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta was not released by HSV-1-infected macrophages, demonstrating that HSV-1 can antagonize inflammasome function. In conclusion, our results provide a global view of the secretome of HSV-1-infected macrophages, revealing host factors possibly having a role in antiviral defense.
