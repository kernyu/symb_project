Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is often performed for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) whose disease has relapsed after chemotherapy treatment. However, graft versus leukemia (GVL) effects in ALL are generally weak and the mechanisms of this weakness are unknown. These studies tested the hypothesis that ALL cells that have survived conventional chemotherapy in vivo acquire relative resistance to the allogeneic GVL effect. C57BL/6 mice were injected with murine pre-B ALL lines driven by human mutations and then were treated with combination chemotherapy. ALL cells surviving therapy were analysed in vitro and in vivo for acquisition of resistance to chemotherapy, radiation, cytolytic T cells, NK cells, LAK cells and cytokines. In vivo drug treatment did lead to leukemia population with more rapid proliferation and also decreased sensitivity to vincristine, doxorubicin and radiation. However, drug treatment did not produce ALL populations that were less sensitive to GVL effects in vitro or in vivo.
