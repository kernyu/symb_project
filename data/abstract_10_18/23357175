In the absence of definite marker for artemisinin (ART) resistance, molecular monitoring of its partner drug sulfadoxine pyrimethamine (SP) in artemisinin based combination therapy (ACTs) together with chloroquine (CQ) for which ART is negatively correlated, may predict the effectiveness of ACT. We analyzed 201 Plasmodium falciparum field isolates for drug resistance markers for CQ (pfcrt and pfmdr1), pyrimethamine (pfdhfr) and sulfadoxine (pfdhps). Our study reveals high prevalence and non-random association of resistant mutants (K76T and N86Y) of CQ markers (pfcrt and pfmdr1). The predominance of highly resistant pfdhfr genotypes for SP with intragenic and intergenic pair-wise linkage disequilibrium between single nucleotide polymorphisms of resistant mutants of pfdhfr (C59R and S108N) and pfdhps (S436A, A437G, K540E) warn on further inclusion of SP in ACT. These findings suggest the replacement of SP in ACT with alternative partner drug for better efficacy.
