A national point-prevalence survey for infection or colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), and for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) was done in Canadian hospitals in 2010. A follow-up survey was done in November 2012 to determine whether there were any changes in the prevalence of these organisms; we also determined the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CREs). Associations between prevalence and infection prevention and control policies were evaluated in logistic regression models. A total of 143 (67% of eligible facilities) hospitals with 29 042 adult inpatients participated in the survey, with representation from all 10 provinces; 132 hospitals participated in 2010 and 2012. There were no significant changes in the median prevalence of MRSA in 2010 (4.3%) compared to 2012 (3.9%), or of CDI in 2010 (0.8%) compared to 2012 (0.9%). A higher median prevalence of VRE was identified in 2012 (1.3%) compared to 2010 (0.5%) (p 0.04), despite decreased VRE screening in 2012. The median prevalence of ESBLs was 0.7% and was 0 for CREs; CREs were reported from only 10 hospitals (7.0%). A policy of routinely caring for patients with MRSA or VRE in a private isolation room was associated with lower prevalence of these organisms. Targeted screening of high-risk patients at admission was associated with lower MRSA prevalence; better hand hygiene compliance was associated with lower VRE prevalence. These data provide national prevalence rates for antibiotic-resistant organisms among adults hospitalized in Canadian hospitals. Certain infection prevention and control policies were associated with prevalence.
