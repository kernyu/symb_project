Antimicrobial peptide has the potential to be developed as new kind of antimicrobial agents with novel action mechanism. However, the susceptibility to protease is a drawback for potential peptides to be clinical used. D-amino acid substitution can be one way to increase the proteolytic stability of peptides. In the present study, we synthesized the D-lysines substituted analog (D-lys-MPI) and the D-enantiomer of polybia-MPI (D-MPI) to improve the proteolytic resistance of polybia-MPI. Our results showed that, the stability of its D-amino acid partially substituted analog D-lys-MPI was increased. However, it lost antimicrobial activity at the tested concentration with the loss of alpha-helix content. As shown in the CD spectra, after substitution, the spectra of D-MPI is symmetrical to MPI, indicated it turned into left hand alpha-helical conformation. Excitingly, the stability of D-MPI toward the tested protease was improved greatly. Notably, the antimicrobial activity of D-MPI was comparable to its L-counterpart MPI, even improved. In addition, the hemolytic activity of D-MPI was lowered. This also indicated that the action target of antimicrobial peptide polybia-MPI was not chiral specific. So, D-MPI may offer a therapeutic strategy to defend the infection of microbes, considering its stability to protease and relatively lower cytotoxicity to human erythrocytes.
