Hyaluronic acid is a biopolymer with valuable applications in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus cells transformed with a nisin-inducible, empty plasmid control displayed higher molecular weight. This increase in molecular weight is independent of the nisin promoter or antibiotic resistance. Using 2D DIGE followed by mass spectrometry, we identified up-regulation of the last step in UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine biosynthesis (GlmU) and down-regulation of the first step in peptidoglycan biosynthesis (MurA) as possible mechanism for the plasmid effect. Over-expression of GlmU to further increase activity had no effect on UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine levels or molecular weight, while over-expression of MurA reduced UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine levels and molecular weight. Global transcriptional analysis revealed that differential regulation of GlmU and MurA activity was not reflected in transcription levels. This results, suggest that regulation is at a translational or post-translational level. Differential expression of two clp proteases may explain this effect as well as the small but significant changes in transcription levels of nearly 300 genes.
