The screening of an in-house quinolones library against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) H(37) Rv, followed by a first cycle of optimization, yielded 6-hydrogen-8-methyl derivatives endowed with good potency. The antitubercular activity also encompassed the bacteria in a non-replicating state (NRP-TB) with minimum inhibitory concentration values lower than those of the reference agent, moxifloxacin. Among the best compounds, 11w and 11ai, characterized by a properly substituted piperidine at the C-7 position, were active against single-drug-resistant (SDR-TB) Mtb strains, maintaining overall good potency also against ciprofloxacin-resistant Mtb. This study expands the body of SAR around antitubercular quinolones leading to reconsider the role played by the usual fluorine atom at the C-6 position. Further elaboration of the 6-hydrogen-8-methylquinolone scaffold, with a particular focus on the C-7 position, is expected to give even more potent congeners holding promise for shortening the current anti-TB regimen.
