BACKGROUND & AIMS: Danoprevir is a potent and selective inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A serine protease. The present study assessed the safety, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity of danoprevir in a randomized, placebo-controlled, 14-day multiple ascending dose study in patients with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection. METHODS: Four cohorts of treatment-naive (TN) patients (100 mg q12 h, 100 mg q8 h, 200 mg q12 h, 200 mg q8 h) and one cohort of non-responders (NR) to prior pegylated interferon alfa-ribavirin treatment (300 mg q12 h) were investigated. RESULTS: Danoprevir was safe and well tolerated; adverse events were generally mild, transient and were not associated with treatment group or dose level. Danoprevir displayed a slightly more than proportional increase in exposure with increasing daily dose and was rapidly eliminated from the plasma compartment. Maximal decreases in HCV RNA were: -3.9 log(10)IU/ml and -3.2 log(10)IU/ml in TN receiving 200 mg q8 h and 200 mg q12 h, respectively. End of treatment viral decline in these two cohorts was within 0.1 log(10)IU/ml of the viral load nadir. HCV RNA reduction in NR was more modest than that observed in upper dose TN cohorts. The overall incidence of viral rebound was low (10/37) and was associated with the R155K substitution in NS3 regardless of the HCV subtype. CONCLUSIONS: Danoprevir was safe and well tolerated when administered for 14 days in patients with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection. Treatment resulted in sustained, multi-log(10) IU/ml reductions in HCV RNA in upper dose cohorts. These results support further clinical evaluation of danoprevir in patients with chronic HCV.
