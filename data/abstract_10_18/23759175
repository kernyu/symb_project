Gonococcal resistance to antibiotics is increasing worldwide. In patients tested in Dutch STI clinics in 2009, gonococcal resistance to ciprofloxacin was over 50%. Ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin, has been the first-choice medication since 2004. General practitioners treated 25% of their gonorrhoea patients with ciprofloxacin in 2010. There is a need for up-to-the-minute, dynamic guidelines for treating gonorrhoea as well as the more systematic use of an up-to-date digital prescription system.
