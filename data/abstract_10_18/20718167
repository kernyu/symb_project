BACKGROUND: The urinary system is one of the common sites of involvement of extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB). The accurate diagnosis and treatment of extrapulmonary TB is complex and difficult. OBJECTIVE: To address the epidemiology and drug susceptibility of urinary tract TB in southern Thailand. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A retrospective analysis of data collected at the time of diagnosis of urinary tract TB cases, during a 10-year period from 1998 to 2007. Data collection included demography, presenting symptoms, laboratory investigations, and imaging studies of the urinary system. RESULTS: During a 10-year period of the present study, 35 new cases of urinary tract TB were diagnosed, with a male/female ratio of 1.3:1 and a common age group of 31-40 years. 34.3% of the patients were farmers. The most presenting symptoms were polyuria, dysuria and acidic urinary pH with pyuria. 80% ofthe patients had abnormal imaging studies ofthe urinary system, with hydronephrosis being the most frequently found condition. Fifty seven point one percent had positive urine cultures for Mycobacterium and 0.05% of them had streptomycin resistance, while none ofthem had an HIV coinfection. CONCLUSION: The urinary tract TB was more common in male with a common age group of 31-40 years. The common presenting symptoms were long-standing urinary symptoms as frequency in urination, dysuria, hematuria and acidic urinary pH associated with pyuria. In the present study, there was only 0.05% of streptomycin resistance, however, no patients with HIV infection.
