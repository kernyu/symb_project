A total of 10948 clinical isolates was collected throughout the Asia-Pacific region as part of the Tigecycline Evaluation Surveillance Trial (TEST) during 2004-2010, consisting of 7549 Gram-negative and 3399 Gram-positive pathogens. Susceptibility trends for all species demonstrated several significant species-dependent susceptibility changes to multiple antibiotics. The most notable was minocycline, for which significant decreases in susceptibility (P<0.001) were observed for six of the ten species studied. In contrast, statistically significant susceptibility changes for tigecycline were observed in only two of the ten species, namely Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens. Seven years following the introduction of tigecycline into clinical use, this agent remains highly active against a wide range of pathogens from the Asia-Pacific region.
