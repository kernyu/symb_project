Mutations in the connection and RNase H C-terminal reverse transcriptase (RT) domains of HIV-1 have been shown to impact drug resistance to RT inhibitors. However, their impact in the context of non-B subtypes has been poorly assessed. This study aimed to characterize resistance-related mutations in the C-terminal portions of RT in treatment-failing patients from southern Brazil, a region with endemic HIV-1 subtype C (HIV-1C). Viral RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed from 280 infected subjects, and genomic regions were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction, DNA sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. Two novel mutations, M357R and E529D, were evidenced in Brazilian HIV-1C strains from treatment-failing patients. In global viral isolates of subjects on treatment, M357R was selected in HIV-1C and CRF01_AE and E529D was selected in HIV-1 subtype B (HIV-1B). While most C-terminal RT mutations described for HIV-1B also occur in HIV-1C, this work pinpointed novel mutations that display subtype-specific predominance or occurrence.
