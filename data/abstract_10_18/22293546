Among 103 patients with multidrug-resistant HIV who initiated raltegravir, etravirine, and darunavir/ritonavir-containing regimen in the ANRS 139 TRIO trial, 100 participated in extended follow-up and continued study treatment until week 96. Among them, 87 (87%) received an optimized background therapy including either nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors or enfuvirtide, they were 78 (78%) at week 96. At week 96, 88% achieved durable virologic response (<50 copies/mL). CD4 response was maintained (median change of +150 cells/mm(3)). No major toxicity was reported. This triple drug combination showed sustained efficacy and thus should be strongly considered for patients with multiclass-resistant virus.
