Food-borne infections are among the prominent health hazards. Antibacterial agents (ABA) are usually administered to poultry in Lebanon as antibiotic growth promoters (AGP), which might lead to the dissemination of resistant bacterial strains. The aims of this study were to isolate potential food borne pathogens from poultry and investigate an association between AGP usage and antibacterial resistance (ABR). Isolates were obtained from the culture of cloacae swabs and identified. Escherichia coli was the predominant isolate. There was a significant association between the use of tetracycline and gentamicin as AGP and the number of E. coli isolates resistant to these ABA.
