INTRODUCTION: Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as an important nosocomial pathogen in the past decades. Due to the prevalence of A. baumannii across the world, suitable typing methods to investigate the epidemiological distribution of the organism have been developed. The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiological and molecular diversity of A. baumannii strains isolated from nosocomial infections of hospitalized children in Children Medical Center Hospital (CMC), an Iranian referral hospital, in Tehran, Iran. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 27 non-duplicate clinical A. baumannii isolates were collected during October 2013 to March 2014 and tested for antimicrobial resistance to several antibiotic agents. The genetic similarity of the strains was investigated by amplification of Random amplified polymorphic DNA-polymerase chain reaction (RAPD-PCR) method. RESULTS: One predominant RAPD profile (type B) was identified in 15 strains (56% of all typed isolates). Other clusters depicted in the dendrogram, namely A, C, and D comprised 6 (22%), 5 (19%) and 1 (3%) isolates, respectively. All A. baumannii strains were resistant to all antibiotics except colistin. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the clonal spread of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii in our hospital. Therefore, the factors responsible for dissemination of such isolates need to be identified, controlled, and prevented to avoid major outbreaks.
