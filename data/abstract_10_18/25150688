Estrella lausannensis is a new Chlamydia-related bacterium, belonging to the Criblamydiaceae family. As suggested by its species name, this bacterium harbors a peculiar star shape. E. lausannensis is able to infect a wide range of amoebal, fish and mammalian cell lines. Moreover, seroprevalence of 2.9% was reported in children and in women with tubal pathology, showing that humans are commonly exposed to this recently discovered strict intracellular bacteria considered as a potential pathogen. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined using two approaches: qPCR and cellular mortality assay. Antibiotics classically used against intracellular bacteria were tested, including beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, cyclines and macrolides. We showed that E. lausannensis is resistant to beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones, and sensitive to cyclines. Interestingly, E. lausannensis is slightly resistant to azithromycin with a MIC of 2 mug/ml, which is 10 fold higher compared to Waddlia chondrophila and Parachlamydia acanthamoebae MIC's. A single A2059C mutation in 23S rRNA gene could be responsible for this unexpected resistance.
