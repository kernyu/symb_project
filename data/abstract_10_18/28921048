Antimicrobial peptides are promising anti-infective agent candidates because they have a broad antimicrobial spectrum and bioactivity and are unlikely to elicit antibiotic resistance. The bogorols represent a new cationic antibiotic peptide and possess great therapeutic potential because of their bioactivity and precise mode of action. Here, we report that Bogorol B-JX (BBJX), a peptide previously isolated from Brevibacillus laterosporus JX-5 by us, has significant antibacterial and antitumor activities in vitro. BBJX was found to inhibit methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) at 2.5 microg/mL with distinct mechanisms of action from those against Bacillus bombyseptieus and Escherichia coli. It penetrates MRSA membrane with little visible destruction and binds to genomic DNA. BBJX could inhibit the proliferation of human histiocytic lymphoma cell line U-937 and ConA-activated spleen cells at 5 microg/mL, but was not cytotoxic to the Jurkat cells, resting spleen cells or differentiated macrophage-like U-937 immunocytes. Moreover, BBJX caused apoptosis of U-937 cells by opening the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and stimulating the production of reactive oxygen species. Taken together, these studies provided basis for future medical application of the bogorols.
