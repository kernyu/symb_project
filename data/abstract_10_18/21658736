Two hundred and twenty Escherichia coli isolates from 314 Mediterranean water buffalo calves less than 4 weeks old affected by severe diarrhoea with a lethal outcome were characterized for the presence of the virulence factors LT, ST, Stx1, Stx2, haemolysins, intimin, CNF1, CNF2, CDT-I, CDT-II, CDT-III, CDT-IV, and F17-related fimbriae (F17a, F17b, F17c, F17d). The prevalence of ETEC, STEC and NTEC were 1.8%, 6.8% and 20.9%, respectively. The ETEC isolates were all LT-positive and ST-negative. The STEC isolates were all Stx and intimin-positive, with Stx1 (80%) more frequent than Stx2 (27%). The NTEC isolates were all CNF and Hly-positive, with CNF2 (83%) more frequent than CNF1 (22%). Susceptibility assays to 11 antimicrobials displayed high rates of resistance (>30%) to antimicrobials tested. These data show that the most prevalent strains in diarrhoeic water buffalo calves were NTEC, mostly CNF2 and HlyA-positive, with strong associations CNF2/CDT-III and CNF2/F17c.
