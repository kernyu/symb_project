Escherichia coli was the most commonly isolated pathogen in the Canadian Ward Surveillance Study 2007-2009 (3789 isolates). Susceptibility to cefazolin (34.1%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (73.8%), ciprofloxacin (78.4%), and levofloxacin (78.8%) was lowest. Susceptibility was above 90% for meropenem (100%), tigecycline (99.9%), piperacillin-tazobactam (97.6%), nitrofurantoin (96.9%), ceftazidime (95.6%), amoxicillin-clavulanate (94.9%), ceftriaxone (94.1%), cefoxitin (92.3%), and gentamicin (90.8%). Over the study period, there was a significant reduction in susceptibility to amoxicillin-clavulanate and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for urinary tract isolates. Inpatient status was associated with greater resistance to nearly all antimicrobials including greater multidrug resistance (MDR). Increasing age was associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones, ceftriaxone, piperacillin-tazobactam, and MDR. Female gender was associated with susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and nitrofurantoin. In conclusion, greater antimicrobial resistance and MDR in E. coli were observed in inpatients, males, and with increasing age. The deterioration of susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole continues with the greatest reduction in urinary isolates. Significant regional differences in resistance rates were apparent.
