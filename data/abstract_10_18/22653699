Fifty Clostridium perfringens strains were isolated from individual dogs with acute diarrhoea that were not given antibiotics. Toxin types and minimal inhibitory concentrations of 15 antibiotics were determined for each of them. All strains harboured the alpha-toxin gene, 12 of them had both the alpha- and entero-toxin gene and 5 had both the alpha- and beta2-toxin gene. Eighteen percent of the isolates showed resistance to tetracycline and 54 % showed decreased susceptibility to metronidazole which is one of the most frequently used antibiotics in the treatment of canine diarrhoea. Apart from that, all isolates were susceptible to the remaining antibiotics tested. These findings lead to the conclusion that despite a general susceptibility to antibiotics in C. perfringens, resistance is developing in isolates from dogs. Therefore, careful identification of the pathogenic agent and antibiotic susceptibility testing should be performed prior to therapy in order to minimise further selection of antibiotic resistance.
