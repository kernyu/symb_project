The cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria functions as a surface organelle that continuously interacts with its environment through a plethora of cell wall-associated molecules. Enterococcus faecium is a normal inhabitant of the GI tract of mammals, but has recently become an important etiological agent of hospital-acquired infections in debilitated patients. Insights into the assembly and function of enterococcal cell wall components and their interactions with the host during colonization and infection are essential to explain the worldwide emergence of E. faecium as an important multiantibiotic-resistant nosocomial pathogen. Understanding the biochemistry of cell wall biogenesis and principles of antibiotic resistance at the molecular level may open up new frontiers in research on enterococci, particularly for the development of novel antimicrobial strategies. In this article, we outline the current knowledge on the most important antimicrobial resistance mechanisms that involve peptidoglycan synthesis and the role of cell wall constituents, including lipoteichoic acid, wall teichoic acid, capsular polysaccharides, LPxTG cell wall-anchored surface proteins, WxL-type surface proteins and pili, in the pathogenesis of E. faecium.
