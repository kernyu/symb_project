Antimicrobial resistance patterns in a collection of 33 motile Aeromonas species were described in this study. Quinolone has been frequently employed for treatment of Aeromonas-related diseases, and prolonged use of antimicrobial compounds has led to development of resistant strains. In a sample of diseased fish and environmental water, we evaluated nalidixic acid (n = 19) and ciprofloxacin (n = 4) resistance via minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays and the genetic basis was also investigated. Among the isolated Aeromonas spp., 17 strains encoded for chromosomal mutations of quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) in gyrA, 11 strains encoded for mutations of QRDRs in parC, 1 strain harbored plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) qnrS1-like gene and 4 strains harbored the PMQR qnrS2 gene. In particular, the new variant (qnrS1-like) differed from qnrS1 by 6 amino acid substitutions at positions 5 (Asn(5)-->Arg(5)), 120 (Ser(120)-->Thr(120)), 148 (Asn(148)-->His(148)), 206 (Leu(206)-->Glu(206)), 207 (Ile(207)--> Leu(207)), and 216 (Tyr(216)-->Phe(216)), and the gene was designated qnrS5. These resistant strains may function as reservoirs of quinolone resistance.
