From 2008 to 2013, 39 Helcococcus kunzii strains were collected from human clinical specimens (79% from foot ulcers), and 85% of the 39 patients were infected. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and molecular methods accurately identified all isolates. This large study of clinical observations confirms the potential pathogenic role of H. kunzii.
