This assessment aims to determine the prevalence of methicillin resistance and multidrug resistance (MDR) among the clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and antimicrobial susceptibility profile of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) to the frequently prescribed antibiotics in Karachi. Isolates of MRSA, recovered from various clinical samples were included in this prospective, cross-sectional study from Jan 2015 to June 2017. Agar diffusion method was employed according to the protocols of Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute. Out of total 346 S. aureus strains, the frequency rate of MRSA was 52% (n = 180). MRSA infection was found higher among the age group 21-30 years i.e. 30% (n=54), followed by 20% (n=36) in 31-40 years. Frequency of MRSA percentage in male and female was and 70% and 30% respectively. MRSA was more frequently observed in blood 20% (n=36). MRSA showed high resistance (100%) to Oxacillin and Cefoxitin while 25% Vancomycin resistant S. aureus (VRSA) isolates and 25% Teicoplanin resistance were also reported. MRSA exhibited 16% resistance to Minocycline. It was concluded that MRSA pose a challenging threat to public health in Karachi. In addition, MDR should be periodically checked to avoid treatment failure.
