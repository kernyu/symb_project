Several lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolates from the Lactobacillus genera have been applied in food preservation, partly due to their antimicrobial properties. Their application in the control of human pathogens holds promise provided appropriate strains are scientifically chosen and a suitable mode of delivery is utilized. Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a global problem, affecting mainly diabetic patients and women. Many uropathogens are developing resistance to commonly used antibiotics. There is a need for more research on the ability of LAB to inhibit uropathogens, with a view to apply them in clinical settings, while adhering to strict selection guidelines in the choice of candidate LAB. While several studies have indicated the ability of LAB to elicit inhibitory activities against uropathogens in vitro, more in vivo and clinical trials are essential to validate the efficacy of LAB in the treatment and prevention of UTI. The emerging applications of LAB such as in adjuvant therapy, oral vaccine development, and as purveyors of bioprotective agents, are relevant in infection prevention and amelioration. Therefore, this review explores the potential of LAB isolates and their bacteriocins to control uropathogens, with a view to limit clinical use of antibiotics.
