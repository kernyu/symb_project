BACKGROUND: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is one of the major causes of infectious diarrhea in developing countries. This study aimed to characterize the prevalence and phenotypic and genotypic features of ETEC isolates from Shenzhen, China. METHODS: ETEC isolates were obtained from acute diarrheal patients and evaluated for enterotoxin, classical colonization factors (CFs), serotypes, antimicrobial susceptibility, and multilocus sequencing typing (MLST). RESULTS: A total of 168 (1.3%) ETEC strains were isolated from 13,324 diarrheal outpatients during 2009 and 2014. A vast majority of ETEC-infected patients (82.1%) belonged to the age ranging 20-59 years and only six patients were children aged <5 years. Heat-stable toxin (ST) was most frequently detected (81.5%), followed by heat-labile toxin (LT) (13.1%). One or multiple colonization factors (CFs) were identified in 91 ETEC strains (54.2%). The most frequently detected CF was CS6 (with or without other CFs) (84/91), followed by CS21 (14/91). The most common serotype was O159:H34 (n = 36), followed by O148:H28 (n = 25) and O27:H7 (n = 17). High resistant rate was observed to nalidixic acid (77.4%), cephalothin (41.7%), ampicillin (34.5%), and tetracycline (21.4%). Antimicrobial resistance profiles differed among different serogroups. Sequence type (ST) 10 complex, integrated with connected ST218, ST48, ST4, and ST1312 subgroups, covered 73 (43.5%) isolates. CONCLUSIONS: ETEC isolates in Shenzhen of China appeared highly diverse, yet some isolates belonged to well-defined clonal groups sharing a unique set of virulence factors, serotypes, and MLST sequence types. Facing the challenge of ETEC antigenic diversity and geographic variation, novel molecules and/or classical antigens designed by novel strategies might contribute to ETEC vaccine development.
