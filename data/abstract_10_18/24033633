Historical resistance patterns often guide empiric antibiotic choices in staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS), but little is known about the difference in susceptibility between SSSS and other childhood staphylococcal infections. A retrospective chart review of culture-confirmed cases of SSSS seen in the inpatient dermatology consultation service at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia between 2005 and 2011 was performed. Most cases of SSSS at our institution are due to oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and approximately half of the cases are due to clindamycin-resistant strains. Clindamycin and a penicillinase-resistant penicillin are suggested as empiric treatment for SSSS until culture susceptibility data are available to guide therapy.
