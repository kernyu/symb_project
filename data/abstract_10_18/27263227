An 86-year-old woman with severe dementia had been treated with oral prednisolone at 2 mg/day for autoimmune bullous dermatosis for several years. One year ago, she referred to our hospital due to an ulcerative skin lesion over the right tibial tuberosity. The lesion was treated by an iodine-containing ointment, but did not heal. Subsequently, a new skin lesion appeared in the right popliteal fossa. One month ago, the patient had increased sputum production that was accompanied by fever, anorexia, and dyspnea; consequently, she visited our department. Chest computed tomography revealed diffuse micronodules with ground-glass attenuation. Acid-fast bacteria staining of the sputum was positive and the polymerase chain reaction detected Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In addition, the bacilli were also found in the skin lesions of the right limb. Therefore, a diagnosis of cutaneous, and miliary tuberculosis was made. Although the anti-tuberculous combination chemotherapy consisting of isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol was immediately initiated, her condition did not improve. She died on day 19 of hospitalization. Drug susceptibility testing revealed no resistance to all the three drugs; hence, it was concluded that the time-delay in diagnosis of cutaneous tuberculosis lead to the progression to miliary tuberculosis and subsequent death.
