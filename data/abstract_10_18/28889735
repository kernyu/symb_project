Antimicrobial resistance constitutes a global health problem, while the discovery and development of novel antibiotics is stagnating. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, responsible for the establishment of recalcitrant, biofilm-related infections, is a well-known and notorious example of a highly resistant micro-organism. Since resistance development is unavoidable with conventional antibiotics that target bacterial viability, it is vital to develop alternative treatment options on top. Strategies aimed at more subtle manipulation of bacterial behavior have recently attracted attention. Here, we provide a literature overview of several small-molecule potentiators for antibiotics, identified for the treatment of Staphylococcus aureus infection. Typically, these potentiators are not bactericidal by themselves and function by reversing resistance mechanisms, by attenuating Staphylococcus aureus virulence, and/or by interfering with quorum sensing.
