Despite years of investigation into triclabendazole (TCBZ) resistance in Fasciola hepatica, the genetic mechanisms responsible remain unknown. Extensive analysis of multiple triclabendazole-susceptible and -resistant isolates using a combination of experimental in vivo and in vitro approaches has been carried out, yet few, if any, genes have been demonstrated experimentally to be associated with resistance phenotypes in the field. In this review we summarize the current understanding of TCBZ resistance from the approaches employed to date. We report the current genomic and genetic resources for F. hepatica that are available to facilitate novel functional genomics and genetic experiments for this parasite in the future. Finally, we describe our own non-biased approach to mapping the major genetic loci involved in conferring TCBZ resistance in F. hepatica.
