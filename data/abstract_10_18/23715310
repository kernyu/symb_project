INTRODUCTION: The plant Solanum nudum (Solanaceae) is extensively used for the treatment of malaria-related symptoms in traditional medicine practices in the Colombian Pacific. Recently, it has become a significant source of promising new molecules for developing a pharmaceutical malaria treatment. OBJECTIVE: This research aimed to evaluate the cytotoxic effect and the genetic damage of standardized extracts of S. nudumon different cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty six standardized S. nudum extracts were used, evaluating cytotoxicity in U937 and HepG2 cells and the antiplasmodial activity using both a chloroquine-sensitive (NF54) and a chloroquine-resistant (FCB2) strain. The hemolytic effect on healthy O + erythrocytes, the mutagenic effect on S.Typhimurium TA98 and TA100 strains and the genotoxic effect on U937 cells were evaluated. The extracts that displayed both antiplasmodial activity and low toxicity were selected. RESULTS: Five extracts were selected: 28MA1, 29MA1, 51MA1, 55MA1 and 61MA1. These extracts were active against P. falciparum with IC 50 between 9.8 and 54.8 microg/ml and selectivity indexes were calculated between 0.9 and 4.4, the latter for 29MA1. Also, no hemolytic effects in healthy O + erythrocytes were shown at a concentration of 250 microg/ml, nor did they cause mutations in the TA98 and TA100 strains or generate genotoxic effects in U937cells. CONCLUSION: The use of standardized extracts of S. nudum could contribute to the body of work aimed at developing a new pharmaceutical treatment for malaria using natural products.
