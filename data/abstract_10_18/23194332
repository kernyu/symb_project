The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)- and plasmidic AmpC-beta-lactamase (pAmpC-BL)-producing Escherichia coli isolates has been studied in food-producing animals at the farm level in Tunisia, and recovered isolates were characterized for the presence of other resistance genes and integrons. Eighty fecal samples of food-producing animals (23 sheep, 22 chickens, 22 cattle, six horses, five rabbits, and two dromedaries) were obtained from 35 different farms in Tunisia in 2011. Samples were inoculated onto MacConkey agar plates supplemented with cefotaxime (2 mg/L) for cefotaxime-resistant (CTX(R)) E. coli recovery. CTX(R) E. coli isolates were detected in 11 out of 80 samples (13.8%), and one isolate per sample was further characterized (10 from chickens and one from a dromedary). The 11 CTX(R) isolates were distributed into phylogroups: B1 (five isolates), A (two isolates), D (three isolates), and B2 (one isolate). The following beta-lactamase genes were detected: bla(CTX-M-1) (seven isolates), bla(CTX-M-1)+bla(TEM-135) (one isolate), bla(CTX-M-1)+bla(TEM-1b) (one isolate), and bla(CMY-2) (two isolates). All ESBL- and pAmpC-BL-producing E. coli strains showed unrelated pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns. Seven isolates contained class 1 integrons with four gene cassette arrangements: dfrA17-aadA5 (three isolates), dfrA1-aadA1 (two isolates), dfrA15-aadA1 (one isolate), and aadA1 (one isolate). All isolates showed tetracycline resistance and contained the tet(A) +/- tet(B) genes. Virulence genes detected were as follows (number of isolates in parentheses): fimA (10); aer (eight); papC (two); and papGIII, hly, cnf, and bfp (none). Chicken farms constitute a reservoir of ESBL- and pAmpC-BL-producing E. coli isolates of the CTX-M-1 and CMY-2 types that potentially could be transmitted to humans via the food chain or by direct contact.
