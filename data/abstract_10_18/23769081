OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of preoperative, perioperative, and long-term treatment in liver transplant (OLT) patients suffering hepatitis B (HBV)-induced liver disease, in terms of graft and survivals as well as disease recurrence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 19 HBV-infected patients who underwent OLT between 2000 and 2010 using antiviral treatment with either lamivudine (LAM, n = 14) and/or adefovir/entecavir/tenofovir (n = 8) before OLT. Fifteen subjects showed a HBV DNA-negative status prior to OLT. All patients were administered HBIG (antiHBs immunoglobulin) perioperatively: 10,000 international units (IU) in the anhepatic phase and 2.000 IU/d until day 7 after OLT. The preoperative antiviral regimen was continued as maintenance prophylaxis from day 1 after OLT. In cases of the YMMD mutation the antiviral treatment was switched to combination therapy with entecavir and tenofovir. RESULTS: Patient follow-up as of December 2011 or till time of death ranged from 6 to 129 months (median = 47). All patients were prescribed tacrolimus. None of them experienced HBV-related graft dysfunction or graft loss. All subjects were HBV DNA negative at 6 months after OLT. HBV recurrence in the post-OLT phase was discovered in 3 patients, 2 of whom had undergone OLT because of acute liver failure due to hepatitis B. They showed LAM-resistant mutations at the time of recurrence and underwent entecavir/tenofovir therapy to achieve HBV DNA negative status. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated excellent long-term outcomes among patients after successful preoperative antiviral treatment for HBV. Patients should be given a high dosage of HBIG during the first week after OLT in combination with the preoperatively established antiviral treatment. In presence of a LAM-resistance mutation, antiviral treatment should be adapted individually to achieve HBV recurrence freedom and graft survival.
