Acne is common in adolescence but is also increasingly seen in adulthood, with about 40% of adults being affected. Topical and systemic oral antibiotics have been used for more than 40 years in the treatment of acne lesions. In the 1970s, evidence of resistance to topical erythromycin and clindamycin was reported and, since then, antibiotic resistance in acne has been increasing worldwide. Antibiotic exposure can be significant in acne treatment because the patient population is large and there is a tendency for prolonged treatment regimens to be prescribed. The overuse of antibiotics is now considered a major public health problem. Action is therefore required to encourage judicial and appropriate use of antibiotics in acne management in line with available evidence-based guidelines. Alternatives to topical antibiotics for the treatment of acne should be considered. Topical antibiotics should no longer be used as monotherapy in acne treatment and use in combination regimens should be limited to a maximum of four weeks. Evidence from studies suggests that, as for topical antibiotics, oral antibiotics should not be used as monotherapy, but instead should be combined with a topical retinoid or benzoyl peroxide for a maximum of four months. Correct and appropriate use of antibiotics in the treatment of acne will help to preserve their utility in the face of increasing antibiotic resistance but greater awareness of the issues is required among prescribing physicians.
