The impact of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases (PMAbetas) of animal origin has been a public health concern. In this study, 562 Salmonella enterica and 598 Escherichia coli isolates recovered from different animal species and food products were tested for antimicrobial resistance. Detection of ESBL-, PMAbeta-, plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR)-encoding genes and integrons was performed in isolates showing non-wild-type phenotypes. Susceptibility profiles of Salmonella spp. isolates differed according to serotype and origin of the isolates. The occurrence of cefotaxime non-wild-type isolates was higher in pets than in other groups. In nine Salmonella isolates, blaCTX-M (n = 4), blaSHV-12 (n = 1), blaTEM-1 (n = 2) and blaCMY-2 (n = 2) were identified. No PMQR-encoding genes were found. In 47 E. coli isolates, blaCTX-M (n = 15), blaSHV-12 (n = 2), blaCMY-2 (n = 6), blaTEM-type (n = 28) and PMQR-encoding genes qnrB (n = 2), qnrS (n = 1) and aac(6')-Ib-cr (n = 6) were detected. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to describe the presence of blaCMY-2 (n = 2) and blaSHV-12 (n = 1) genes among S. enterica from broilers in Portugal. This study highlights the fact that animals may act as important reservoirs of isolates carrying ESBL-, PMAbeta- and PMQR-encoding genes that might be transferred to humans through direct contact or via the food chain.
