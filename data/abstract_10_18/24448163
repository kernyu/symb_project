Three major classes of retroviral restriction factors (APOBEC3G, Tetherin, and TRIM5alpha) have been identified in mammals. Restriction factors are cellular proteins that are able to limit viral replication by targeting specific steps of the viral life cycle. To evaluate which restriction factor is the most effective to inhibit the replication of porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs), the antiviral activity of each restriction factor was compared. In pseudotype assay, the antiviral activity of human tetherin against PERV pseudotype was slightly weaker than that of human APOBEC3G (hA3G). A combination of tetherin and hA3G was more potent than each individual restriction factor. We questioned whether a combination of tetherin and hA3G could also inhibit the spreading replication of PERV. In agreement with the pseudotype assay, two restriction factors inhibit infectious PERV replication in a spreading infection. In this study, hA3G could strongly inhibit the replication of PERV, but tetherin modestly restricted it. Based on these results, we concluded that a combination of tetherin and hA3G is the most effective way to restrict PERV. A combination of different restriction factors will encourage the development of a new approach to treat retroviral disease.
