OBJECTIVE: The aim of this prospective study was to compare the efficacy of the first-line lansoprazole-based sequential therapy and concomitant therapy (lansoprazole, amoxicillin, clarithromycin and metronidazole) for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication. METHODS: A total of 169 patients with H. pylori infection were randomly assigned to either the sequential therapy group (n = 85) or the concomitant therapy group (n = 84). A follow-up endoscopy or urea breath test was examined at least 12 weeks after eradication. RESULTS: Comparable H. pylori eradication rate was observed in both the sequential therapy and concomitant therapy groups by either intention-to-treat analysis [sequential 80.0% (68/85) vs concomitant 88.1% (74/84); P = 0.27] or per protocol analysis [sequential, 85.3% (64/75) vs concomitant, 94.6% (70/74); P = 0.60]. Adverse effects were reported and good compliance was observed in both groups (P = 0.72). Although dual antibiotics resistance affected the therapeutic efficacy of sequential therapy (P = 0.03), not concomitant therapy (P = 0.74), it was not an independent factor for predicting the treatment outcome. CONCLUSION: First-line lansoprazole-based sequential and concomitant therapy were well-tolerated and comparable in terms of their H. pylori eradication rate.
