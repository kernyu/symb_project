We investigated the role of genes of hevein-like antimicrobial peptides of the WAMP family in the protection of wheat plants against biotic and abiotic stress. The semiquantitative RT-PCR method was used to examine the expression of wamp genes in wheat seedlings in response to infection by pathogens and exposure to phytohormones and ions of a heavy metal ion-cadmium. We discovered that wheat germ contamination by harmful fungi significantly increases expression of genes of the wamp family, and the primary transcript is wamp-2. We determined that salicylic acid, rather than methyl jasmonate, induces expression of genes of the wamp family. We showed that abiotic stress induced by cadmium ions inhibits expression of wamp genes in the roots with no effect on their expression in shoots. The results support the protective role of wamp genes in the response of wheat plants to infections by pathogens. In turn, the resistance to abiotic stress induced by cadmium ions does not appear to be associated with expression of genes of the wamp family.
