INTRODUCTION: Chronic dacryocystitis results in chronic infection and inflammation of the lacrimal sac. OBJECTIVE: To identify the aetiology of chronic dacryocystitis and to determine their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross - sectional study was undertaken including 120 lacrimal swab materials collected from patients aged above 15 years suffering from chronic dacryocystitis. STATISTICS: Data analysis was done by using software "Win pepi'' ver 7.9. RESULTS: The bacteria of eight different species were isolated from 76.66 % (92/120) culture positive samples. 85.86 % showed a single and 14.13 % showed a mixed growth pattern. Coagulase negative staphylococci were the most common bacteria (P= 0.018) accounting for 33.96 % followed by Staphylococcus aureus (25.46 %), Streptococcus pneumoniae ( 19.81 % ), Streptococci viridans (5.66 %), Escherichia coli (5.66 %), Haemophilus spp ( 4.71 % ), Streptococcus pyogenes (3.77 %) and Bacillus spp (0.94 % ). Staphylococcus aureus were the most predominant bacteria in mixed growth. Rate of infection was higher in males 81.39 % than in females 74.02 %. Infection was higher in the age group of above 31 years. In the antimicrobial susceptibility test, except staphylococcus aureus, all the Gram positive isolates were 100 % sensitive to chloramphenicol and were least sensitive to tobramycin, but Gram negative isolates were equally sensitive to Chloramphenicol and Nalidixic acid. CONCLUSION: Coagulase negative staphylococci are the most frequently isolated bacteria. Staphylococcus aureus is predominantly found in mixed growth. Chloramphenicol is the most effective drug of choice for chronic dacryocystitis.
