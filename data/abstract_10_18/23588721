Increased baseline expression and lack of induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) are strong negative predictors of therapeutic response to PegIFN/RBV in patients co-infected with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV). This study specifically addressed whether ISG-15 expression influences therapeutic responses in 20 HIV/HCV genotype-1 subjects undergoing HCV treatment. Non-responders had significantly higher baseline expression and selective induction of ISG-15 after IFN-alpha treatment relative to participants with sustained virological response. High baseline levels of ISG-15 were also associated with less induction of ISG with treatment. These results support a role for ISG-15 as a prognostic indicator and resistance factor to IFN-alpha.
