A significant fraction (46/108, 43%) of swine isolates of Campylobacter coli but none of 81 isolates of C. coli from turkeys had genomic DNA that was resistant to digestion by MboI, suggesting methylation of adenines at GATC sites. No consistent association was noted between antimicrobial resistance and MboI resistance. Seven swine-associated multilocus sequence typing-based sequence types (STs) were detected among multiple isolates with MboI-resistant DNA. The data suggest host-associated DNA modification system(s) specific for adenine at GATC sites in C. coli from swine.
