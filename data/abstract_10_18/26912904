Antibiotic administration can disrupt the intestinal microbiota and down-regulate innate immune defenses, compromising colonization resistance against orally acquired bacterial pathogens. Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE), a major cause of antibiotic-resistant infections in hospitalized patients, thrives in the intestine when colonization resistance is compromised, achieving extremely high densities that can lead to bloodstream invasion and sepsis. Viral infections, by mechanisms that remain incompletely defined, can stimulate resistance against invading bacterial pathogens. We report that murine norovirus infection correlates with reduced density of VRE in the intestinal tract of mice with antibiotic-induced loss of colonization resistance. Resiquimod (R848), a synthetic ligand for Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR-7) that stimulates antiviral innate immune defenses, restores expression of the antimicrobial peptide Reg3gamma and reestablishes colonization resistance against VRE in antibiotic-treated mice. Orally administered R848 triggers TLR-7 on CD11c(+) dendritic cells, inducing interleukin-23 (IL-23) expression followed by a burst of IL-22 secretion by innate lymphoid cells, leading to Reg3gamma expression and restoration of colonization resistance against VRE. Our findings reveal that an orally bioavailable TLR-7 ligand that stimulates innate antiviral immune pathways in the intestine restores colonization resistance against a highly antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogen.
