PURPOSE OF REVIEW: After decades of neglect, the importance of establishing an aetiological diagnosis for community-acquired and atypical pneumonias has increased dramatically in recent years--driven by the movement towards more rational use of antibiotics, the further spread of antimicrobial resistance, and advances in point-of-care assays that circumvent the diagnostic delays that result from the centralization of laboratories. RECENT FINDINGS: There have been very few developments in patient sampling, or the direct visualization, culture, and serological detection of respiratory pathogens. There has, however, been significant interest in the development of improved and more clinically useful assays for the detection of pathogen nucleic acids and proteins, and also in the potential utility of the assessment of host response for tailoring therapy. SUMMARY: The majority of patients have yet to benefit from any advances. However, nucleic acid, newer protein, and possibly host-response assays have significant potential to influence patient care in the near future.
