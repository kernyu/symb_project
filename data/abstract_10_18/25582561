Bacteria use a signaling mechanism called quorum sensing (QS) to form complex communities of surface-attached cells known as biofilms. This protective mode of growth allows them to resist antibiotic treatment and originates the majority of hospital-acquired infections. Emerging alternatives to control biofilm-associated infections and multidrug resistance development interfere with bacterial QS pathways, exerting less selective pressure on bacterial population. In this study, biologically stable coatings comprising the QS disrupting enzyme acylase were built on silicone urinary catheters using a layer-by-layer technique. This was achieved by the alternate deposition of negatively charged enzyme and positively charged polyethylenimine. The acylase-coated catheters efficiently quenched the QS in the biosensor strain Chromobacterium violaceum CECT 5999, demonstrated by approximately 50% inhibition of violacein production. These enzyme multilayer coatings significantly reduced the Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145 biofilm formation under static and dynamic conditions in an in vitro catheterized bladder model. The quorum quenching enzyme coatings did not affect the viability of the human fibroblasts (BJ-5ta) over 7 days, corresponding to the extended useful life of urinary catheters. Such enzyme-based approach could be an alternative to the conventional antibiotic treatment for prevention of biofilm-associated urinary tract infections.
