INTRODUCTION: Acquired production of metallo-beta-lactamases is an important mechanism of resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The objective of this study was to investigate the production of metallo-beta-lactamase and the genetic diversity among ceftazidime-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates from State of Sergipe, Brazil. METHODS: Metallo-beta-lactamase was investigated using the disk approximation test and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Genetic diversity was evaluated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). RESULTS: A total of 48 (51.6%) isolates were resistant to ceftazidime. Six (12.2%) of these were positive for metallo-beta-lactamase production. Only two (4.1%) of the ceftazidime-resistant isolates carried the bla SPM-1 gene. CONCLUSIONS: Production of metallo-beta-lactamases was not the main mechanism of resistance to ceftazidime and carbapenems among P. aeruginosa strains in Sergipe, Brazil.
