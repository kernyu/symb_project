Bariatric surgery aims at weight reduction of severely obese patients. The Roux-en-Y technique is one of the most common bariatric procedures and is occasionally accompanied by nutrient insufficiencies and metabolic changes. According to the literature, skin architecture and immunity change after bariatric surgery and may lead to inflammation and increased susceptibility to pathogens. Additionally, vitamin and mineral deficiencies frequently develop in these patients and affect the skin's defense mechanisms, possibly contributing to dermatological complications. Knowledge and recognition of skin changes after bariatric surgery make an important asset for the dermatologist and help in the proper treatment of these patients. We report 2 cases of infectious skin lesions where vitamin and trace element deficiencies have possibly contributed to their persistence and resistance to traditional treatments.
