A survey for transmitted HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) was conducted according to WHO guidelines among clients newly diagnosed with HIV-1 infection at two voluntary counseling and testing centers (VCTC) in Mumbai. HIVDR testing was performed using the ViroSeq RT-PCR method (Abbott). Out of 50 successfully amplified and sequenced specimens, analysis of the first 34 consecutively collected specimens revealed no nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, or protease inhibitor mutations from the 2007 WHO list of mutations for surveillance of transmitted HIVDR, indicating that the prevalence of transmitted HIVDR to all three drug classes was <5% among recently infected VCTC clients in Mumbai. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that all samples belonged to HIV-1 subtype C. Continued ART program monitoring and further evaluation of transmitted HIV drug resistance in coming years are essential in Mumbai as well as in other regions of the country in which ART is being scaled up rapidly.
