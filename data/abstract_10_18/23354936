Nursing- and healthcare-associated pneumonia (NHCAP) has been proposed by the Japanese Respiratory Society as a new category of pneumonia considering the characteristics of the Japanese medical care environment. It is necessary to ascertain the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of NHCAP. A prospective study was conducted of patients with pneumonia who were hospitalized at our hospital from August 2011 to July 2012. We compared 192 cases of NHCAP with 114 cases of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Compared with CAP, NHCAP had a higher disease severity, higher 30-day mortality rate (10.9 vs. 3.5 %, P = 0.022), and longer length of hospital stay (median, 12 vs. 8 days, P < 0.001). Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most frequent causative pathogen in both NHCAP and CAP (33.9 vs. 34.8 %, P = 0.896). The incidence of atypical pathogens in NHCAP was low (1.7 %). Multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens were isolated more frequently in NHCAP than in CAP, but there was no significant difference (11.0 vs. 4.5 %, P = 0.135). Among 192 NHCAP patients, 122 (63.5 %) were aspiration pneumonia. Aspiration pneumonia was associated with poor outcomes and was considered a major characteristic of NHCAP. Our study suggested that many patients with NHCAP do not need broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy targeting MDR pathogens. Excess mortality in NHCAP patients is the result of patient backgrounds or disease severity rather than the presence of MDR pathogens.
