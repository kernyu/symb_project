The purpose of this study was to investigate the phenotypic and molecular characterization of a novel plasmid-mediated AmpC-type beta-lactamase in Klebsiella pneumoniae E701 isolated from Anhui province in China. In comparison with the ACT-1, sequence analysis revealed that there were 43 point mutations in the coding gene, and 10 of which led to amino-acid substitution. Resistance could be transferred by conjugation or transformation with plasmid DNA into E. coli JM109, which was due to the production of a beta-lactamase with an isoelectric point of 8.4 named ACT-6. Cloning, expression, purification and kinetics were carried out to study the characterization of the novel AmpC-type beta-lactamase. The results of MIC determinations and substrate profiles showed there was no significant difference in the activities of the novel enzyme and ACT-1. Moreover, the class 1 integron and the whole open reading frame of the novel AmpC-type beta-lactamase from K.pneumoniae E701 were detectable in the same size plasmid. This is the first report on the emergence of the novel ACT-6 type beta-lactamases in K. pneumoniae.
