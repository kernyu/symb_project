Most of the anti-breast cancer drugs are often limited owing to drug resistance and serious adverse reactions. Therefore, development of more targeted and low toxic drugs from traditional Chinese medicines for breast cancer are needed. At the same time, establishment of fast and effective drug screening methods are urgently required. We describe here a 2D LC method of MDA-MB-231 cell membrane chromatography combined with HPLC/MS for recognition, separation, and identification of target components from traditional Chinese medicine Cortex Magnolia officinalis. The MDA-MB-231 cells membrane was used to prepare the chromatographic stationary phase in the first dimension. The active compounds had a retention characteristic on the cell membrane chromatography model (10 x 2.0 mm, 5 mum). The retention fractions were enriched using an online C(18) column (10 x 1.0 mm, 5 mum) and were analyzed by the second dimension RP chromatography. Finally, the activity of the retention fractions was tested through in vitro experiments. Results showed that the retention fractions were honokiol and magnolol and the inhibition rate on MDA-MB-231 cell growth were 23 and 64 muM, respectively. These results support the conclusion that this coupled analytical technique could be an efficient method in drug discovery.
