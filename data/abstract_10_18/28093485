Objectives: Fosfomycin activity in Escherichia coli depends on several genes of unknown importance for fosfomycin resistance. The objective was to characterize the role of uhpT , glpT , cyaA and ptsI genes in fosfomycin resistance in E. coli. Methods: WT E. coli BW25113 and null mutants, Delta uhpT , Delta glpT , Delta cyaA , Delta ptsI , Delta glpT-uhpT , Delta glpT-cyaA , Delta glpT-ptsI , Delta uhpT-cyaA , Delta uhpT-ptsI and Delta ptsI-cyaA , were studied. Susceptibility to fosfomycin was tested using CLSI guidelines. Fosfomycin mutant frequencies were determined at concentrations of 64 and 256 mg/L. Fosfomycin in vitro activity was tested using time-kill assays at concentrations of 64 and 307 mg/L (human C max ). Results: Fosfomycin MICs were: WT E. coli BW25113 (2 mg/L), Delta glpT (2 mg/L), Delta uhpT (64 mg/L), Delta cyaA (8 mg/L), Delta ptsI (2 mg/L), Delta glpT-uhpT (256 mg/L), Delta glpT-cyaA (8 mg/L), Delta glpT-ptsI (2 mg/L), Delta uhpT-cyaA (512 mg/L), Delta uhpT-ptsI (64 mg/L) and Delta ptsI-cyaA (32 mg/L). In the mutant frequency assays, no mutants were recovered from BW25113. Mutants appeared in Delta glpT , Delta uhpT , Delta cyaA and Delta ptsI at 64 mg/L and in Delta uhpT and Delta cyaA at 256 mg/L. Delta glpT-ptsI , but not Delta glpT-cyaA , Delta uhpT-cyaA or Delta uhpT-ptsI , increased the mutant frequency compared with the highest frequency found in each single mutant. In time-kill assays, all mutants regrew at 64 mg/L. Initial bacterial reductions of 2-4 log 10 cfu/mL were observed for all strains, except for Delta uhpT-ptsI , Delta glpT-uhpT and Delta uhpT-cyaA . Only Delta glpT and Delta ptsI mutants were cleared using 307 mg/L. Conclusions: Fosfomycin MIC may not be a good efficacy predictor, as highly resistant mutants may appear, depending on other pre-existing mutations with no impact on MIC.
