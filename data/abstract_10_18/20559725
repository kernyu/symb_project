We assessed the antimicrobial resistance patterns of all urine samples submitted for culture from outpatient women aged >/=14 years with diagnosis of uncomplicated cystitis over a 24-month period (2007-2009) in the city of Fortaleza, Brazil. Only bacterial growth of a single uropathogen with >/=10(5) CFU/mL was considered for analysis. The Pearson's chi-square test was used for bivariate correlations. Escherichia coli presented the highest prevalence (64.7%). Coagulase-negative staphylococcus was more common in younger than in older women (P = 0.003). Gentamicin presented the lowest overall resistance pattern (3.5% resistant), followed by ceftriaxone (5%) and norfloxacin (7.5%). Ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were the least active agents with 63.7% and 39.8% of resistance, respectively. The resistant rate to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was significantly higher among E. coli than non-E. coli isolated. Among ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli strains, only 3.4% were resistant to nitrofurantoin. We conclude that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole follows a worldwide tendency of antimicrobial increasing resistance and it should be avoided as first-line empirical treatment for urinary tract infections.
