PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Echinocandin resistance in Candida is a great concern, as the echinocandin drugs are recommended as first-line therapy for patients with invasive candidiasis. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of the epidemiology, underlying mechanisms, methods for detection and clinical implications. RECENT FINDINGS: Echinocandin resistance has emerged over the recent years. It has been found in most clinically relevant Candida spp., but is most common in C. glabrata with rates exceeding 10% at selected institutions. It is most commonly detected after 3-4 weeks of treatment and is associated with a dismal outcome. An extensive list of mutations in hot spot regions of the genes encoding the target has been characterized and associated with species and drug-specific loss of susceptibility. The updated antifungal susceptibility testing reference methods identify echinocandin-resistant isolates reliably, although the performance of commercial tests is somewhat more variable. Alternative technologies are being developed, including molecular detection and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight. SUMMARY: Echinocandin resistance is increasingly encountered and its occurrence makes susceptibility testing essential, particularly in patients with prior exposure. The further development of rapid and user-friendly commercially available susceptibility platforms is warranted. Antifungal stewardship is important in order to minimize unnecessary selection pressure.
