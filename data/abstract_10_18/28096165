Ceftolozane-tazobactam was tested against 58 multidrug-resistant nonfermenting Gram-negative bacilli (35 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 11 Achromobacter xylosoxydans, and 12 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates) isolated from cystic fibrosis patients and was compared to ceftolozane alone, ceftazidime, meropenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam. Ceftolozane-tazobactam was the most active agent against P. aeruginosa but was inactive against A. xylosoxydans and S. maltophilia In time-kill experiments, ceftolozane-tazobactam had complete bactericidal activity against 2/6 clinical isolates (33%).
