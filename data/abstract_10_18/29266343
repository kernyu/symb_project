The continuing threat of antimicrobial resistance presents a considerable challenge to researchers to develop novel strategies ensuring that bacterial infections remain treatable. Many plant extracts have been shown to have antibacterial properties and could potentially be combined with other antibacterial agents to create more effective formulations. In this study, the antibacterial activity of three plant extracts and virulent bacteriophages have been assessed as individual components and in combination. When assessed with a modified suspension test, these plant extracts also exhibit antiviral activity at bacterial inhibitory concentrations. Hence, to investigate any potential additive effects between the extracts and virulent phages, the extracts were tested at subantiviral concentrations. Phages alone and in combination with plant extracts significantly reduced (P < 0.05) the bacterial concentration compared to untreated and extract treated controls up to 6 h (2-3log10 ), but this reduction did not extend to 24 h. In most cases, the phage and extract combinations did not significantly reduce bacterial content compared to phages alone. Additionally, there was little impact on the ability of the phages to reproduce within their bacterial hosts. To our knowledge, this study represents the first of its kind, in which antimicrobial plant extracts have been combined with virulent phages and has highlighted the necessity for plant extracts to be functionally characterized prior to the design of combinatorial therapies. Significance and Impact of Study This preliminary study provides insights into the potential combination of bacteriophages and antimicrobial plant bulk extracts to target bacterial pathogens. It is to our knowledge the first time in which virulent bacteriophages have been combined with antimicrobial plant extracts.
