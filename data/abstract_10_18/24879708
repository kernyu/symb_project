The aim of the current work was to evaluate the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of Campylobacter spp. isolated from different chicken production systems at the slaughterhouse level. Chicken sampling at slaughterhouse was performed for cecum, carcass, and breast meat from flocks of organic (n = 6), extensive indoor (n = 14), and intensive production (n = 14), totaling 34 ceca pools, 64 neck skin pools, and 132 breasts, representing 96,386 chickens. A collection of 167 strains were identified as Campylobacter coli (n = 85) and Campylobacter jejuni (n = 82) and were tested for susceptibility to 11 antimicrobial agents by the disk diffusion method. The frequency of Campylobacter in chicken samples from different production systems was between 79 and 100%. Campylobacter isolated from all origins were resistant to the fluoroquinolones studied (80-98%). However, for ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, the Campylobacter isolates from extensive indoor chicken were significantly (P < 0.05) less resistant (77 and 58%) than that from organic (97 and 91%) and intensive production (96 and 95%). A high probability of tetracycline resistance occurrence was also found for the Campylobacter spp. tested (58% for C. jejuni and 76% for C. coli). A more frequent profile of multidrug resistance was noticed for isolates from intensive and organic production than for extensive indoor production. These results reinforce the need of efficient strategy implementation to control and reduce Campylobacter in chickens at production and slaughter levels, and the necessity to reduce the use of antimicrobials in poultry sector.
