INTRODUCTION: Antimicrobial resistance is a growing concern with implications for animal health. This study investigated the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among commensal and environmental Escherichia coli isolated from animals sampled in referral hospitals in the UK. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Resistant Escherichia coli isolated from animal faeces and practice environments were tested for susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. PCR and sequencing techniques were used to identify extended spectrum beta-lactamase and AmpC-producer genotypes. RESULTS: In total, 333 faecal and 257 environmental samples were collected. Multi-drug resistant Escherichia coli were found in 13.1% of faecal and 8.9% of environmental samples. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase and AmpC genes were identified 14% and 7.7% of faecal samples and 8.6% and 8.6% of environmental samples, respectively. The most common extended spectrum beta-lactamase gene type detected was blaCTX-M -15 , although blaTEM-158 was detected in faecal and environmental samples from one practice. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Escherichia coli resistant to key antimicrobials were isolated from hospitalised animals and the practice environment. We identified the emergence of the inhibitor resistant and extended spectrum beta-lactamase blaTEM-158 in companion animals. Further investigation to determine risk factors for colonisation with antimicrobial-resistant bacteria is needed to provide evidence for antimicrobial stewardship and infection control programmes.
