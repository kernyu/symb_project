The emergence of NDM-1 has become established as a major public health threat and represents a new and major challenge in the treatment of infectious diseases. A total of 39 carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates collected from patients receiving care at 5 teaching hospitals in Jiangxi province, central China, were analyzed for carriage of resistance genes, including bla(NDM-1). Two carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates (NC12 and NC18) were found to harbor bla(NDM-1). In addition to bla(NDM-1), NC12 also carried bla(SHV-1), while NC18 harbored additional resistance genes, including bla(SHV-12), bla(CTX-M-14), armA and bla(TEM-1). NC12 and NC18 belonged to ST15 and novel ST1031 and were clonally unrelated. Carbapenem resistance for NC12 could be transferred to Escherichia coli recipients through conjugation and chemical transformation, while carbapenem resistance for NC18 was only transferred to E. coli recipients by chemical transformation. The EcoR1-digested DNA pattern of plasmids from the transformants of NC12 was identical to that for NC18. Taken together, this is the first report of bla(NDM-1) carriage by K. pneumoniae clinical isolates in mainland China, indicating that bla(NDM-1) is disseminated among Enterobacteriaceae in China. Systemic surveillance should focus on the dissemination of bla(NDM-1) among Gram-negative clinical isolates, especially some major clones, such as K. pneumoniae ST15 which is a major clone among CTX-M-15-producing isolates.
