OBJECTIVE: To investigate the serotypes, antimicrobial resistance, virulence genes and molecular characteristics of food-borne Vibrio parahaemolyticus isolated in Guangdong province in 2014. METHODS: Sixty V. parahaemolyticus strains were tested in this study. The serotyping and antibiotic resistance test were conducted, while the tdh and trh gens of the strains were detected with conventional PCR, and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multiple locus sequence typing (MLST) were conducted too. RESULTS: The 60 strains belonged to 13 serotypes, the major serotypes included O3: K6, O4: K8, O1: K36 and O4: KUT. The antibiotic resistance test indicated the isolates were highly resistant to ampicillin (100.0%), sulfonamides (43.3%) and cefalotin (28.3%). Up to 56.7%(34/60) of the strains were resistant to two or more antibiotics, and 2 strains showed resistance to three antibiotics. The virulence gene detection indicated that 63.3% (38/60) of the strains carried tdh(+) trh(-), while only 1 strain carried tdh(+) trh(+). The 60 strains digested by NotI belonged to 48 different PFGE patterns and 3 clusters. The cluster B included the strains isolated from sporadic food borne cases with serotype of O3: K6 and similarity of 62.6%-100.0%. The cluster C included O4: K8 strains with the PFGE pattern similarity of 56.7%-62.5%. The MLST indicated that the 60 strains had 26 sequence types (STs). The ST-3 was predominant, including 33 strains (serotypes O3: K6 and O1 :K36). The four O4: K8 strains formed another predominant colony, which was different from ST-3. CONCLUSION: The etiologic characteristics of V. parahaemolyticus varied, which might be one of the reasons for high incidence of food-borne V. parahaemolyticus infection in Guangdong. The molecular characteristics of O4: K8 strain were different from the other predominant serotypes. Close attention should be paid to the possible outbreak caused by O4: K8 strain in this area.
