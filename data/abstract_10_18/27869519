Medical science is pitted against an ever-increasing rise in antibiotic tolerant microorganisms. Concurrently, during the past decade, biofilms have garnered much attention within research and clinical practice. Although the significance of clinical biofilms is becoming very apparent, current methods for diagnostics and direction of therapy plans in many hospitals do not reflect this knowledge; with many of the present tools proving to be inadequate for accurately mimicking the biofilm phenomenon. Based on current findings, we address some of the fundamental issues overlooked by clinical labs: the paradigm shifts that need to occur in assessing chronic wounds; better simulation of physiological conditions in vitro; and the importance of incorporating polymicrobial populations into biofilm models. In addition, this review considers using a biofilm relevant in vitro model for cultivating and determining the antibiotic tolerance and susceptibility of microorganisms associated with chronic wounds. This model presents itself as a highly rapid and functional tool that can be utilized by hospitals in an aim to improve bedside treatments.
