The Xpert Carba-R kit, version 2 (v2), which has been improved for the efficient detection of blaOXA-181 and blaOXA-232 genes, was tested on a collection of 150 well-characterized enterobacterial isolates that had a reduced susceptibility to carbapenems. The performance of the Xpert Carba-R v2 was high, as it was able to detect the five major carbapenemases (NDM, VIM, IMP, KPC, and OXA-48). Thus, it is now well adapted to the carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae epidemiology of many countries worldwide.
