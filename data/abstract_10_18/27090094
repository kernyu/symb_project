BACKGROUND: Sphingobacterium spiritivorum is a microorganism that is ubiquitously found in the environment. However, it is rarely isolated from human clinical specimens. There are few reports to date of Sphingobacterium spiritivorum causing disease in humans. CASE REPORT: We describe a case of Sphingobacterium spiritivorum infection in a patient on haemodialysis, which to our knowledge, has not been described before. Further testing revealed this strain was sensitive to multiple antimicrobials. CONCLUSION: Despite interrupted courses of several antibiotics, our patient clinically made a good recovery and continued to receive haemodialysis.
