Biofilms are diverse communities of microorganisms embedded within a self-produced matrix of extracellular polymeric substance which are firmly attached to biotic or abiotic surfaces. Approximately 80% of all human infections are associated with biofilms and evidence for their role in an ever-growing number of cutaneous disorders is constantly unfolding. Biofilms present a difficult challenge to clinicians due to their persistent nature, inability to be cultured with standard techniques, and resistance to conventional antimicrobial therapy. Although limited treatment options are presently available, better understanding of the molecular biology of biofilms and their pathogenicity will likely lead to the development of novel anti-biofilm agents for clinical use.
