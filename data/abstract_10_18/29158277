Long-term catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) involving coagulase-negative staphylococci are associated with poor patient outcomes, increased hospitalization, and high treatment costs. The use of vancomycin lock therapy has been an important step forward in treatment of these biofilms, although failures occur in 20% of patients. In this study, we report that a high dose of daptomycin lock therapy may offer a therapeutic advantage for these CRBSIs in just 24 h of treatment.
