This work describes the synthesis of a series of fatty acid hydrazide derivatives of isoniazid (INH). The compounds were tested against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (ATCC 27294) as well as INH-resistant (ATCC 35822 and 1896 HF) and rifampicin-resistant (ATCC 35338) M. tuberculosis strains. The fatty acid derivatives of INH showed high antimycobacterial potency against the studied strains, which is desirable for a pharmaceutical compound, suggesting that the increased lipophilicity of isoniazid plays an important role in its antimycobacterial activity.
