Biofilm formation involves the development of extracellular matrix and initially depends on adherence and tropism by flagellar movement. With the widespread development of antibiotic resistance and tolerance of biofilms, there is a growing need for novel anti-infective strategies. No currently approved medications specifically target biofilms. Aptamers are single-stranded nucleic acid molecules that may bind to their targets with high affinity and affect the target functions. We developed a bifunctional conjugate by linking an aptamer targeting bacterial flagella with ampicillin. We investigated its influence on biofilm prevention and dissolution by ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry, inverted microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. This conjugate had distinctive antibacterial activity. Notably, the conjugate was more active than either component, and thus had a synergistic effect against biofilms.
