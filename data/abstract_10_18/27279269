Leminorella is a member of Enterobacteriaceae family and was known previously as Enteric Group 57. Based upon genetic differences using DNA hybridization, it has three taxa: Leminorella grimontii, Leminorella richardii, and Leminorella sp. strain 3. The third one is similar biochemically to the L. grimontii strains. The generic name has been derived on the name of a French microbiologist, Leon Le Minor. The biochemical properties includes being facultative anaerobes, growth on sheep blood, TSI, and MacConkey agar; hydrogen sulfide producer, l-arabinose fermenter, and tyrosine hydrolyzer; and are negative for d-mannose fermentation, urea, and lipase. They usually infect in adulthood and result in urinary tract infection, surgical site infection, bacteremia, peritonitis, respiratory tract infection, and soft tissue infection. We report the first case of L. grimontii sepsis in a very low birth weight neonate that died because of neonatal sepsis.
