The treatment duration of acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis (AUP) is still under debate. As shortening treatment duration could be a means to reduce antimicrobial resistance, we aimed to establish whether 5 days of antibiotic treatment is non-inferior to 10 days in patients with AUP. We performed an open-label prospective randomized trial comparing 5 days to 10 days of fluoroquinolone treatment for AUP. The inclusion criteria were: female patients aged >/=18 years with clinical signs of urinary tract infection, fever >38 degrees C, and positive urinalysis. Patients were randomized to either 5 or 10 days of fluoroquinolone treatment. Outcome was cure at day 10 and day 30 after the end of treatment. One hundred patients were randomized and 12 were excluded after randomization. The mean +/- standard deviation (SD) age was 31.8 +/- 11 years old and the mean +/- SD temperature was 38.6 +/- 0.7 degrees C. The main bacterium involved was Escherichia coli (n = 86; 97.7%) and 3 (3.4%) patients had a positive blood culture. In the post-hoc analysis, clinical cure 10 days after the end of the treatment was 28/30 (93.3%) in the 5-day arm and 36/38 (94.7%) in the 10-day arm (p = 1.00). At day 30, the clinical cure rate was 23/23 (100%) in the 5-day arm and 20/20 (100%) in the 10-day arm (p = 1.00). The microbiological cure rate was 20/23 (87.0%) in the 5-day arm and 16/20 (80.0%) in the 10-day arm (p = 1.00). The efficacy of 5 days of fluoroquinolone treatment does not seem different from 10 days of treatment for AUP.
