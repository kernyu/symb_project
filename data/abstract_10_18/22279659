OBJECTIVE: To study the adsorption of 2,4-dichlorophenol of the modified chitosan. METHODS: A type of N-alkyl chitosan derivative was synthesized by using glutaraldehyde as a kind of crosslinker and characterized by FTIR. The effects of adsorption conditions, such as time, pH, the concentration of 2,4-dichlorophenol and the amount of the modified chitosan on the adsorption quantity of 2,4-dichlorophenol adsorpted were studied. RESULTS: The resistance on acid and alkaline of N-alkyl chitosan exhibited was good acid resistance. At pH 6.5, the adsorption of 2,4-dichlorophenol reached the maximum in 40 minutes. Adsorption capability of the modified chitosan was increased by 13.8-fold and it could be regenerated and reused. CONCLUSION: The crosslinked chitosan had good adsorption capability for 2,4-dichlorophenol.
