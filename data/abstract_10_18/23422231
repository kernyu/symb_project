This study reviewed the clinical and microbiologic data for patients admitted to the intensive care unit with hospital-acquired infections. In the multivariate analysis, AIDS and previous antibiotic use were associated with the emergence of multiresistant bacteria. Hematologic diseases, length of stay, number of days on central venous catheter, antimicrobial use, and presence of multiresistant bacteria were associated with death. The previous use of antibiotics and the length of the hospital stay contribute to the development of infections caused by multiresistant gram-negative bacteria.
