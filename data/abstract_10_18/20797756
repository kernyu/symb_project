Mechanisms of difference in interferon sensitivity between hepatitis C virus (HCV) strains have yet to be clarified. Here, we constructed an infectious genotype2b clone and analyzed differences in interferon-alpha sensitivity between HCV-2b and 2a-JFH1 clones using intergenotypic homologous recombination. The HCV-2b/JFH1 chimeric virus able to infect Huh7.5.1 cells and was significantly more sensitive to IFN than JFH1. IFN-induced expression of MxA and 25-OAS was significantly lower in JFH1 than in 2b/JFH1-infected cells. In JFH1-infected cells, expression of SOCS3 and its inducer, IL-6, was significantly higher than in 2b/JFH1-infected cells. The IFN-resistance of JFH1 cells was negated by siRNA-knock down of SOCS3 expression and by pretreatment with anti-IL6 antibody. In conclusion, intergenotypic differences of IFN sensitivity of HCV may be attributable to the sequences of HCV structural proteins and can be determined by SOCS3 and IL-6 expression levels.
