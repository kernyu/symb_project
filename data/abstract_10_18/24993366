BACKGROUND & AIMS: The high prevalence of chronic hepatitis B in Asian countries produces a substantial economic burden. Peginterferon has immunomodulatory effects and a finite course for treatment of hepatitis B, but also a high cost and side effects. The recent introduction of a 12-week stopping rule (stopping treatment after 12 weeks) has increased its appeal as a first-line treatment for hepatitis B. We aimed to determine the cost effectiveness of the 12-week stopping rule for peginterferon in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive and HBeAg-negative patients. METHODS: We used Markov modeling, with data from the Hong Kong population, to compare the cost effectiveness of peginterferon therapy with a 12-week stopping rule vs conventional therapy (48 weeks) and with other antiviral agents. RESULTS: For HBeAg-positive patients, stopping peginterferon therapy after 12 weeks had the lowest cost-effectiveness ratio (CER), of $9501/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), compared with no treatment, making it the most cost-effective option. Conventional (48-week) peginterferon treatment had a CER of $9664/QALY. For HBeAg-negative patients, entecavir had the lowest CER ($34,310/QALY). Entecavir was more cost effective than either peginterferon strategies (CERs of $37,423/QALY for 12 weeks of peginterferon and $38,474/QALY for 48 weeks of treatment). CONCLUSIONS: The 12-week stopping rule increases the cost effectiveness of peginterferon therapy, and is the most cost-effective treatment for HBeAg-positive patients. The need for long-term antiviral therapy for HBeAg-negative patients makes entecavir the most cost-effective strategy.
