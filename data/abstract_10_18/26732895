An innovative and straightforward synthesis of second-generation 2-arylbenzo[b]thiophenes as structural analogues of INF55 and the first generation of our laboratory-made molecules was developed. The synthesis of C2-arylated benzo[b]thiophene derivatives was achieved through a method involving direct arylation, followed by simple structural modifications. Among the 34 compounds tested, two of them were potent NorA pump inhibitors, which led to a 16-fold decrease in the ciprofloxacin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against the SA-1199B strain at concentrations of 0.25 and 0.5 mug mL(-1) (1 and 1.5 mum, respectively). This is a promising result relative to that obtained for reserpine (MIC=20 mug mL(-1)), a reference compound amongst NorA pump inhibitors. These molecules thus represent promising candidates to be used in combination with ciprofloxacin against fluoroquinolone-resistant strains.
