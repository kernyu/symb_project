The fates of BlaI, the gene repressor protein for the bla operon, BlaR1, the beta-lactam sensor/signal transducer, and PC1 beta-lactamase in four strains of Staphylococcus aureus upon exposure to four different beta-lactam antibiotics were investigated as a function of time. The genes for the three proteins are encoded by the bla operon, the functions of which afford inducible resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in S. aureus. BlaR1 protein is expressed at low copy number. Acylation of the sensor domain of BlaR1 by beta-lactam antibiotics initiates signal transduction to the cytoplasmic domain, a zinc protease, which is activated and degrades BlaI. This proteolytic degradation derepresses transcription of all three genes, resulting in inducible resistance. These processes take place within minutes of exposure to the antibiotics. The BlaR1 protein was shown to undergo fragmentation in three S. aureus strains within the time frame relevant for manifestation of resistance and was below the detection threshold in the fourth. Two specific sites of fragmentation were identified, one cytoplasmic and the other in the sensor domain. This is proposed as a means for turnover, a process required for recovery from induction of resistance in S. aureus in the absence of the antibiotic challenge. In S. aureus not exposed to beta-lactam antibiotics (i.e. not acylated by antibiotic) the same fragmentation of BlaR1 is still observed, including the shedding of the sensor domain, an observation that leads to the conclusion that the sites of proteolysis might have evolved to predispose the protein to degradation within a set period of time.
