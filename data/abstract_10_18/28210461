BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cholera is an endemic diarrheal disease in Iran, caused by Vibrio Cholerae. The epidemiology, transmission route, environmental determinants and antimicrobial resistant pattern of cholera have been changed during recent years. In this study the epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance of cholera in Iran during 2013 outbreak was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective, cross-sectional study was carried out using cholera national surveillance system collected data in 2013. Bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were done on 60 Vibrio cholerae isolates, serotype Inaba. RESULTS: During July to November 2013, 256 confirmed cholera cases were diagnosed by stool culture. Two hundred and eleven out of 256 (83%) cases were imported from Afghanistan and Pakistan. The prevalent age group was 16-30 years old, 90% were male, 98.8% affected by Inaba serotype and case fatality rate was 2.7%. The results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing on 60 V. cholerae, serotype Inaba showed that all isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid, tetracyclin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and intermediate resistance to erythromycin but sensitive to ciprofloxacin, cefixime and ampicillin. CONCLUSION: Migrants from neighboring countries played a key role in cholera outbreak in Iran during 2013. The results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing on 60 V. cholerae, serotype Inaba showed an increasing resistance rate in comparison with previous years.
