We reassessed the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) clinical breakpoints (CBPs) for voriconazole. We examined i) the essential (EA: +/-2 dilutions) and categorical agreement between 24-h CLSI and EUCAST methods for voriconazole testing of Candida, ii) wild-type (WT) MICs and epidemiologic cutoff values (ECVs) for voriconazole by both CLSI and EUCAST methods, and iii) correlation of MICs with outcomes from previously published data using CLSI methods. We applied these findings to propose new 24-h species-specific CLSI CBPs. Adjusted 24-h CBPs for voriconazole and C. albicans, C. tropicalis, and C. parapsilosis (susceptible, </= 0.125 mug/mL; intermediate, 0.25-0.5 mug/mL; resistant, >/= 1 mug/mL) should be more sensitive for detecting emerging resistance among common Candida species and provide consistency with EUCAST CBPs. In the absence of CBPs for voriconazole and C. glabrata (and less common species), we recommend that their respective ECVs be used to detect the emergence of non-WT strains.
