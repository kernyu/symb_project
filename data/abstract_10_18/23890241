There are few veterinary clinical studies to support a recommended use and dose for treating resistant bacterial infections in small animals. Resistance against many common antibiotics is possible and a susceptibility test is advised. Infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa presents a special problem. Staphylococcus isolated from small animals is most likely to be Staphylococcus pseudintermedius. The most important resistance mechanism for Staphylococcus is methicillin resistance. The only antimicrobials to which some gram-negative bacilli are sensitive may be extended-spectrum cephalosporins, carbapenems (penems), selected penicillin derivatives, amikacin, or tobramycin. A susceptibility test is needed to identify the appropriate drug for these infections.
