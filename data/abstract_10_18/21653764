Two mechanisms account for AmpC activity in Escherichia coli, namely, mutations in the ampC promoter and attenuator regions resulting in ampC overexpression and acquisition of plasmid-carried ampC genes. In this study, we analyzed 51 clinical E. coli isolates with reduced susceptibility to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, piperacillin-tazobactam, or extended-spectrum cephalosporins for the presence of AmpC production. Three phenotypic AmpC confirmation assays (cefoxitin-cloxacillin disk diffusion test, cefoxitin-EDTA disk diffusion test, and AmpC Etest) were compared for the detection of AmpC activity. All 51 isolates were characterized genetically by mutational analysis of the chromosomal ampC promoter/attenuator region and by PCR detection of plasmid-carried ampC genes. Altogether, 21/51 (41%) E. coli isolates were considered true AmpC producers. AmpC activity due to chromosomal ampC promoter/attenuator mutations was found in 12/21 strains, and plasmid-carried ampC genes were detected in 8/21 isolates. One strain contained both ampC promoter mutations and a plasmid-carried ampC gene. All three phenotypic tests were able to detect the majority (>90%) of AmpC-positive strains correctly. Cefoxitin resistance was found to be a discriminative parameter, detecting 20/21 AmpC-producing strains. Susceptibility to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, e.g., ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and cefotaxime, was found in 9 of the 21 AmpC-positive strains. Considering the elevated zone diameter breakpoints of the 2010 CLSI guidelines, 2/21 AmpC-positive strains were categorized as susceptible to extended-spectrum cephalosporins.
