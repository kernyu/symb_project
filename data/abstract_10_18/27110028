Antibiotic fitness and acquired resistance are the two critical factors when bacteria respond to antibiotics, and the correlations and mechanisms between these two factors remain largely unknown. In this study, a TMT-labeling-based quantitative proteomics method was used to compare the differential expression of proteins between the fitness and acquired resistance to chlortetracycline in Aeromonas hydrophila biofilm. Bioinformatics analysis showed that translation-related ribosomal proteins, such as 30s ribosome subunits, increased in both factors; fatty acid biosynthesis related proteins, such as FabB, FabD, FabG, AccA, and AccD, increased in biofilm fitness, and some pathways (including propanoate-metabolism-related protein, such as PrpB, AtoB, PflB, AcsA, PrpD, and GabT) displayed decreased abundance in acquired resistance biofilm. The varieties of selected proteins involved in fatty acid biosynthesis and propanoate metabolism were further validated by q-PCR assay or Western blotting. Furthermore, the antibiotic-resistance-function assays showed that fatty-acid biosynthesis should be a protective antibiotics-resistance mechanism and a cocktail of chlortetracycline and triclosan, a fatty-acid-biosynthesis inhibitor, exhibited more efficient antimicrobial capability than did each antibiotic individually on biofilm, specifically on chlortetracycline-sensitive biofilm. We therefore demonstrate that the up-regulation of fatty acid biosynthesis may play an important role in antibiotic resistance and suggest that a cocktail of chlortetracycline and triclosan may be a potential cocktail therapy for pathogenic infections in biofilm.
