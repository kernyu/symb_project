BACKGROUND: Studies evaluating the role of transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) in diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) date back decades and have shaped current practice. However, with the recent advent of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) Xpert(R) MTB/RIF, it is time to re-evaluate the role of TBLB. OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of BAL and TBLB with the addition of BAL Xpert on diagnostic PTB yields and time to treatment initiation in sputum-scarce or acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear-negative PTB patients. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all sputum-scarce or AFB smear-negative patients who underwent both BAL and TBLB for suspected PTB between March 2011 and October 2013. Xpert was performed on all BAL specimens. RESULTS: Of 158 patients included in our analysis, 44 were culture-proven PTB. Ninety-four per cent of the patients had AFB smear-negative BAL samples. The sensitivity and specificity of Xpert in AFB smear-negative BAL samples were respectively 60% and 98%. The addition of BAL Xpert expedited the institution of PTB treatment while having diagnostic yields comparable to those of conventional BAL with TBLB. CONCLUSIONS: The use of BAL Xpert may obviate the need for TBLB in increasing the diagnostic yield of PTB in sputum-scarce or AFB smear-negative patients.
