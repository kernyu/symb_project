AIM: This study aims to characterize a multidrug-resistant (MDR) plasmid p12969-2 coexistent with the previously reported one p12969-DIM in clinical Pseudomonas putida. MATERIALS & METHODS: The complete sequence of p12969-2 was determined using next-generation sequencing technology. RESULTS: p12969-2 contains a 29.2 kb MDR region, which carries In127 harboring three resistance genes aadA2, qacED1 and sul1. The MDR region is derived from the connection of Tn5041D and Tn5045, which is facilitated by two copies of miniature inverted-repeat transposable element. Conclusion & future perspective: p12969-2 represents a novel lineage with the highest but limited nucleotide sequence similarity with the plasmid pGRT1 that does not carry any of the resistance genes. This is the first report of coexistence of two MDR plasmids in P. putida.
