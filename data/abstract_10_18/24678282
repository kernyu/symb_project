Beta-lactamases are a superfamily of enzymes which degrade the beta-lactam class of antibiotics. They are produced endogenously by the bacterial cells, which when exposed to the beta-lactam class of antibiotics inactivate them by cleaving the beta-lactam ring. Based on the presence or absence of metallic ligand, beta-lactamases have been divided into two broad functional classes. beta-Lactamases are a constitutively evolving and expanding superfamily of enzymes, which could be further subdivided on the basis of presence/absence of conserved motifs. In the present study we have used the MEME/MAST suit to identify the patterns/motifs which are specific to a particular family or subfamily of beta-lactamases. The family specific patterns/motifs can be also useful in recognizing and assigning newly discovered beta-lactamases to one or the other family or subfamily. Cross-validation showed that the proposed method is highly sensitive and specific. We have also designed a webserver, LactFP, for this purpose.
