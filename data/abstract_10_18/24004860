OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to determine species distribution and in vitro antifungal susceptibility of Candida isolates identified in the multicentre China-SCAN study of invasive Candida infection (ICI) in intensive care units (ICUs) across China. METHODS: Candida isolates from patients in the China-SCAN study with documented ICI were evaluated by a central laboratory. Species were identified using chromogenic culture media or the API 20C AUX kit. Susceptibility to fluconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, caspofungin and amphotericin B was determined using the CLSI broth microdilution method (M27-A3) and updated clinical breakpoints or epidemiological cut-off values. RESULTS: A total of 389 isolates from 244 patients were analysed. Species identified most frequently were Candida albicans (40.1%), Candida parapsilosis (21.3%), Candida tropicalis (17.2%) and Candida glabrata (12.9%). Rarer species such as Lodderomyces elongisporus and Candida ernobii were also identified. Fluconazole susceptibility was evident in 85.9% (134/156) of C. albicans, 62.7% (42/67) of C. tropicalis and 48.2% (40/83) of C. parapsilosis isolates. Susceptibility to voriconazole was >/= 90% among all species. All isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B and caspofungin except C. glabrata [86.0% (43/50) susceptible to caspofungin]. Cross-resistance between fluconazole and voriconazole was observed for C. parapsilosis and C. glabrata. CONCLUSIONS: Although C. albicans was the predominant single species, non-albicans species constituted >50% of isolates. Fluconazole susceptibility was lower in most non-albicans species, indicating that fluconazole resistance should be closely monitored. Susceptibility to voriconazole, amphotericin B and caspofungin is encouraging. Differences between these data and those from other regions emphasize the importance of assessing regional variations.
