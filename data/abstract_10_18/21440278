Maraviroc binds to the pocket of extracellular loops of the cell surface CCR5 and prevents R5 HIV-1 from using CCR5 as a coreceptor for entry into CD4-positive cells. To evaluate the contribution of the V3 loop structure in gp120 to maraviroc resistance, we isolated maraviroc-resistant variants from the V3 loop library virus (HIV-1(V3Lib)) containing a set of random combinations of 0-10 polymorphic mutations in vitro. HIV-1(V3Lib) at passage 17 could not be suppressed even at 10 muM (>1400-fold resistance), while HIV-1(JR-FL) at passage 17 revealed an 8-fold resistance to maraviroc. HIV-1(V3Lib-P17) contained T199K and T275M plus 5 mutations in the V3 loop, I304V/F312W/T314A/E317D/I318V. The profile of pseudotyped virus containing I304V/F312W/T314A/E317D/I318V in V3 loop alone revealed a typical noncompetitive resistance, although T199K and/or T275M could not confer noncompetitive resistance. This type of library virus is useful for isolation of escape viruses from effective entry inhibitors.
