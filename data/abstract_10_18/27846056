We report on a mother-to-child transmission of KPC carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae at birth followed by subsequent cases in the neonatal intensive care unit. Molecular analysis of isolates showed production of KPC-3 enzyme. The only potential risk factor identified for the mother was previous activity as a caregiver. Present findings suggest consideration of proactive surveillance in pregnant women with risk factors for colonization.
