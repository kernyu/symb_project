Harpin elicits rapid and localized programmed cell death in plants, also known as the hypersensitive response (HR). Here we report that HrpN from Erwinia amylovora led to rapid cell death in maize leaves within 24 h and also induced the expression of systemic acquired resistance genes, such as ZmPR1 and ZmPR5. Surprisingly, the results of DAB staining showed that there was no H(2)O(2) accumulation in maize leaves during the HR process, and semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed that there was also no difference in the expression of the ZmRboh genes. These results suggest that HrpN-induced cell death may be independent of H(2)O(2) accumulation in maize leaves.
