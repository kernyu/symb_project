Temperate bacteriophages small ef, Cyrillic iLp84 and small ef, Cyrillic iLp1308, previously isolated from mitomycin C-induction of Lactobacillus paracasei strains 84 and CNRZ1308, respectively, were tested for their resistance to several physical and chemical treatments applied in dairy industry. Long-term survival at 4 degrees C, -20 degrees C and -80 degrees C, resistance to either thermal treatments of 63 degrees C, 72 degrees C and 90 degrees C, high pressure homogenization (HPH, 100 MPa) or classic (ethanol, sodium hypochlorite and peracetic acid) and new commercial sanitizers, namely A (quaternary ammonium chloride), B (hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid and peroctanoic acid), C (alkaline chloride foam), D (p-toluensulfonchloroamide, sodium salt) and E (ethoxylated nonylphenol and phosphoric acid), were determined. Phages were almost completely inactivated after eight months of storage at 25 degrees C, but viability was not affected at 4 degrees C, -20 degrees C or -80 degrees C. Both phages tolerated well HPH treatments. Phage iLp1308 showed higher thermal resistance than small ef, Cyrillic iLp84, but neither resisted 90 degrees C for 2 min. Best chemical inactivation was accomplished using peracetic acid or biocides A, C and E, whereas biocides B and D were completely ineffective. These results help to improve selection of chemical agents and physical treatments to effectively fight against phage infections in dairy plants.
