We compared and analyzed the expression of the BPI gene of Sutai piglets ranging from newborn to post-weaning days 8, 18, 30, and 35 by the real-time PCR method, in order to determine if it is involved in protection against disease caused by ETEC F18. There was a significant difference between 18 and 35-day expression in the jejunum. There were also significant differences between 35-day expression and expression at the other development stages in the duodenum. There were no significant differences in expression at 8, 18, and 30 days in the jejunum. We conclude that the porcine BPI gene may be the direct factor that resisted the ETEC F18 in weaning piglets, and that the resistance to ETEC F18 in weaning piglets is related to up-regulation of mRNA expression of BPI gene to a certain extent.
