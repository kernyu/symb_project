Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) is a ligand-activated nuclear receptor which has been implicated in carcinogenesis and angiogenesis in a wide range of cancers, including pancreatic carcinoma (PC). We aimed to characterize the prognosis and potential therapeutic implications of PPARgamma in PC. Real-time RT-PCR and western blotting were used to quantify PPARgamma expression in immortalized pancreatic epithelial cells, PC cell lines and freshly isolated matched tumor and non-tumor tissues. PPARgamma protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in archived tumor tissues from 101 PC patients. Furthermore, the effect of PPARgamma on the cytotoxic action of gemcitabine (Gem) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in PC cell lines was investigated in vitro using RNA interference techniques. Both PPARgamma protein and mRNA were expressed at markedly higher levels in all of the PC cell lines and freshly isolated PC tissues, compared to normal immortalized pancreatic epithelial cells and the matched adjacent non-tumor tissues. High levels of PPARgamma expression correlated significantly with tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging (P<0.001) and poor overall survival (P<0.001), especially in patients with advanced disease who received postoperative chemotherapy. While silencing of PPARgamma significantly inhibit the cytotoxic effects of both gemcitabine and 5-fluorouracil in PC cells in vitro. This study suggests that high levels of PPARgamma expression are associated with poor overall survival in PC. Additionally, PPARgamma promotes chemoresistance in PC cells, indicating that PPARgamma may represent a novel therapeutic target for PC.
