Perioperative decolonization of Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriers with mupirocin together with chlorhexidine body washing reduces the incidence of S. aureus surgical site infection. A targeted strategy, applied in S. aureus carriers only, is costly, and implementation may reduce effectiveness. Universal decolonization is more cost-effective but increases exposure of noncarriers to mupirocin and the risk of resistance to mupirocin in staphylococci. High-level mupirocin resistance in S. aureus can emerge through horizontal gene transfer originating from coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) and through clonal transmission. The current evidence on the occurrence of high-level mupirocin resistance in S. aureus and CoNS, in combination with the results of mathematical modeling, strongly suggests that the increased selection of high-level mupirocin resistance in CoNS does not constitute an important risk for high-level mupirocin resistance in S. aureus. Compared with a targeted strategy, universal decolonization seems associated with an equally low risk of mupirocin resistance in S. aureus.
