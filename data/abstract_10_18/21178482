Type I and II interferons (IFNs alphabeta and gamma) have opposing effects on immune resistance to certain pathogenic bacteria. While IFNgamma generally plays a protective role, IFNalphabeta exacerbates Listeria monocytogenes and Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections. Our findings provided evidence that this increased susceptibility reflects a novel antagonistic cross talk between IFNalphabeta and IFNgamma. Macrophages infected with L. monocytogenes strains that induce IFNalphabeta production responded poorly to IFNgamma, as measured by reduced phosphorylation of STAT1 and reduced IFNgamma-dependent gene expression. The impaired responsiveness to IFNgamma correlated with reduced expression of its receptor, IFNGR, by both infected and bystander macrophages. Down regulation of IFNGR was dependent on responsiveness to IFNgamma and mimicked by recombinant IFNbeta. Mice lacking responsiveness to IFNalphabeta (IFNAR1 (-/-)) retained high IFNGR expression, developed higher expression of MHC-II on macrophages and DCs, and were more resistant to systemic L. monocytogenes infection--but only in the presence of IFNgamma. Thus, the ability of IFNalphabeta to down regulate IFNGR provides an explanation for its ability to reduce responsiveness to IFNgamma and to increase host susceptibility to bacterial infection. It remains to be determined whether and how such antagonistic interferon crosstalk benefits the host.
