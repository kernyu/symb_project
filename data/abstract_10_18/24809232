The class 1 integron is an important driver of the nosocomial dissemination of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, such as Acinetobacters. In this study, we characterized the gene cassette arrays of class 1 integrons in Acinetobacter baumannii, where the detailed structure of these integrons for 38 clinical strains was analyzed. The results showed that there are three types of gene cassette arrays that are carried by different class 1 integrons, among them the aac(6')-IId-catB8-aadA1 array was the most prevalent. For detailed analysis of the integron structure, whole genome sequencing was carried out on strain AB16, and it was found that a single integron on its chromosome has a partial Tn21 transposon in its 5' flanking region and two complete copies of the insertion element IS26 in both the 5' and 3' flanking regions, indicating that the integron could be acquired by horizontal gene transfer. Furthermore, there is one resistance island AbaR22, one bla gene containing a transposon, four intrinsic resistant genes and one efflux pump that together confer six types of antibiotic resistance.
