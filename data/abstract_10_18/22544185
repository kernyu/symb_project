The PharmAccess African Studies to Evaluate Resistance (PASER) network was established as a collaborative partnership of clinical sites, laboratories, and research groups in 6 African countries; its purpose is to build research and laboratory capacity in support of a coordinated effort to assess population-level acquired and transmitted human immunodeficiency virus type-1 drug resistance (HIVDR), thus contributing to the goals of the World Health Organization Global HIV Drug Resistance Network. PASER disseminates information to medical professionals and policy makers and conducts observational research related to HIVDR. The sustainability of the network is challenged by funding limitations, constraints in human resources, a vulnerable general health infrastructure, and high cost and complexity of molecular diagnostic testing. This report highlights experiences and challenges in the PASER network from 2006 to 2010.
