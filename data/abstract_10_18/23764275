Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is an acute, highly contagious animal disease caused by FMD virus (FMDV). Although FMDV-induced immunosuppression in host has been well established, the exact molecular mechanism for such induction is not very clear. We report here the identification of FMDV VP1 as an interferon-suppressor by interacting with soluble resistance-related calcium binding protein (sorcin). We found that VP1 suppressed tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha or Sendai virus (SeV)-induced type I interferon response in HEK293T cells, and that this suppression could be completely abolished by knockdown of sorcin by shRNA. Furthermore, overexpression of sorcin inhibited type I interferon response. Conversely, TNF- or SeV-induced type I interferon response increased when sorcin knocked down, leading to inhibition of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) replication. Thus, VP1-induced suppression of type I interferon is mediated by interacting with sorcin, a protein that appears to regulate cell response to viral infections.
