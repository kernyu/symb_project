An intriguing opportunity to address antimicrobial resistance is represented by the inhibition of efflux pumps. Focusing on NorA, the most important efflux pump of Staphylococcus aureus, an efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) library was used for ligand-based pharmacophore modeling studies. By exploitation of the obtained models, an in silico drug repositioning approach allowed for the identification of novel and potent NorA EPIs.
