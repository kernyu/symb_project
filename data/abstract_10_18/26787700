Here, we report twoEnterobacter cloacaesequence type 231 isolates coproducing KPC-3 and NDM-1 that have caused lethal infections in a tertiary hospital in China. TheblaNDM-1-harboring plasmids carry IncA/C2and IncR replicons, showing a mosaic plasmid structure, and theblaNDM-1is harbored on a novel class I integron-like element.blaKPC-3is located on a Tn3-DeltablaTEM-1-blaKPC-3-DeltaTn1722element, flanked by two 9-bp direct-repeat sequences and harbored on an IncX6 plasmid.
