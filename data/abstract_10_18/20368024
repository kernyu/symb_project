OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the ability of GenoType MTBDRplus Assay for detection of rifampin (RFP) and isoniazid (INH) resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. METHODS: seventy-five clinical isolates were tested for traditional drug susceptibility testing and GenoType MTBDRplus assay. The results were compared to assess the sensitivity and specificity of GenoType MTBDRplus assay. RESULTS: the sensitivity of GenoType MTBDRplus assays for detection of RFP and INH resistance were 98.0% and 86.5%, respectively. In pan-susceptible isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the specificity was 100% for both RFP resistance and INH resistance. CONCLUSION: with its high sensitivity and specificity, GenoType MTBDRplus assay is a promising rapid method to detect INH and RFP resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains in Shanghai.
