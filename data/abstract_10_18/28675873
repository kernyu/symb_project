Several factors are known to affect the intestinal microbiota of cattle. However, how these changes occur over time is poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the consequences of entrance into a feedlot and the effects of virginiamycin used as a growth promoter on the bovine fecal microbiota. Two batches of beef cattle (B1, n=50 and B2, n=36) entering a feedlot operation were randomly divided into two pens: one receiving virginiamycin and one group not receiving antibiotic (control group). Fecal samples were collected at arrival, mid feedlot and at exit to slaughter. The V4 region of 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced. Escherichia coli strains isolated in samples from arrival and exit of B2 were also isolated and used as indicators of antimicrobial susceptibility. Marked changes in membership and structure of fecal microbiota occurred following entrance into the feedlot. At mid feedlot, virginiamycin affected bacterial community membership, but not structure, suggesting that the antibiotic had a stronger effect on the rare, but not on the most abundant species. The use of virginiamycin had no demonstrable effect on antibiotic resistance in E. coli. The differences found between batches are suggestive that variations in study conditions are important and can strongly affect the intestinal microbiota.
