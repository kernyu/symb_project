We report the use of elvitegravir 150 mg/cobicistat 150 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg (EVG/COBI/TDF/FTC) once daily, in addition to once-daily atazanavir (ATV) 300 mg, in treatment-experienced patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Due to limited data available on the co-administration of these agents, our objective was to evaluate and monitor safety and efficacy of this regimen in patients who developed resistance or intolerance to conventional antiretroviral therapy (ART). This short report included offenders incarcerated in the Illinois Department of Corrections who were >/=18 years, HIV-infected, had documented antiretroviral resistance, and received EVG/COBI/TDF/FTC + ATV once daily. Based on previous ART, resistance patterns and current medications, seven patients were initiated on once-daily therapy consisting of EVG/COBI/TDF/FTC and ATV. Due to extensive resistance, two of the seven patients were also started on abacavir (ABC) 600 mg daily in addition to EVG/COBI/TDF/FTC and ATV. Of the seven patients, one had ART changed due to concerns of resistance based on a genotype, one experienced a decline in renal function that warranted a change in therapy, and one is currently virologically suppressed on a combination of EVG/COBI/TDF/FTC, ATV, and ABC. The remaining four patients remain virologically suppressed on EVG/COBI/TDF/FTC + ATV. Therapy consisting of EVG/COBI/TDF/FTC and ATV may be a viable option for some treatment-experienced HIV-infected patients. Further studies evaluating the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of this therapy are warranted, given the lack of information currently available.
