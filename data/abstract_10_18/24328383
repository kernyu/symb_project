The isolation rate of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) species and the prevalence of NTM-associated diseases are on the rise in Asian, as well as in Western countries; however, the species distribution of NTM isolates and the types of diseases caused by NTM species vary from region to region. In this review, we present an update on the epidemiology of NTM in Asia. We demonstrate that the distribution of NTM species varies within Asia and differs from that in North America and Europe. In addition, the clinical manifestations of NTM diseases include respiratory tract infections, disseminated infections, skin and soft tissue infections, lymphadenitis, empyema, ocular infections, CNS infections and genitourinary infections. Finally, the rate of adaptive resistance of anti-NTM antimicrobial agents remains high and may be associated with a poor outcome for patients with NTM diseases.
