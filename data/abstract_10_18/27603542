Background Colonization/infection by antibiotic-resistant bacteria is becoming a major threat to health care systems. Case report Two septic neonates were readmitted in our hospital few days after hospital discharge. In both of them, microbiological workup revealed an infection caused by multiresistant pathogens. Noteworthy, one baby had received intensive care management for 4 weeks, whereas the other had been vaginally delivered and sent home on his second day of life. Conclusion These cases suggest that in countries and/or hospital with high prevalence of colonization/infection by resistant pathogens in nurseries, neonatal intensive care units, and obstetric wards, the choice of initial therapy of suspected sepsis in a neonate readmitted from home soon after discharge should take into account the possibility of an infection due to a multiresistant pathogen.
