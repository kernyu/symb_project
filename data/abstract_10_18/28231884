Monodisperse aqueous upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) were covalently immobilized on aldehyde modified cellulose paper via reductive amination to evaluate the multiplexing capacity of luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) between UCNPs and quantum dots (QDs). This is the first account of a multiplexed bioassay strategy that demonstrates the principle of use of a single form of UCNP as donor and three different color emitting QDs as acceptors to concurrently determine three analytes. Broad absorbance profiles of green, orange and red QDs that spanned from the first exciton absorption peak to the UV region were in overlap with a blue emission band from UCNPs composed of NaYF4 that was doped with 30% Yb(3+), 0.5% Tm(3+), allowing for LRET that was stimulated using 980 nm near-infrared radiation. The characteristic narrow and well-defined emission peaks of UCNPs and QDs allowed for the collection of luminescence from each nanoparticle using a band-pass optical filter and an epi-fluorescence microscope. The LRET system was used for the concurrent detection of uidA, Stx1A and tetA gene fragments with selectivity even in serum samples, and reached limits of detection of 26 fmol, 56 fmol and 76 fmol, respectively.
