Carbapenemase-producing organisms (CPOs) are a serious emerging problem for health care facilities worldwide. Owing to their resistance to most antimicrobial therapies, CPOs are difficult to treat and pose a challenge for infection prevention and control. Since 2010, lab-based surveillance for CPOs and PCR-based testing were implemented in British Columbia (BC), Canada. A review of CPOs in BC from 2008 to March 2014 was done to characterize the resistance mechanisms and possible clonal strain transmission and to compare pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and plasmid restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) as molecular typing tools. During this study period, a total of 177 CPO cases were identified. Patient demographics and travel history were reviewed, and a descriptive analysis was carried out. PFGE profiles, MLST, and plasmid RFLP analysis for a subset of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter species isolates were obtained and analyzed. Our findings demonstrate that CPOs have been increasing in number in BC over time, from 1 isolate/year retrospectively identified in 2008 and 2009 to 82 isolates in 2013 and 30 isolates in the first quarter of 2014. Overall, K. pneumoniae isolates lack clonality, although some seemingly related clusters have been found. Plasmid analysis showed evidence of the spread of plasmids carrying carbapenemase-encoding genes between the examined isolates. Analysis of Enterobacter cloacae isolates revealed a more clonal nature of these CPOs in BC. The presence of related clusters provides evidence of interpatient organism transmission both within and between institutions. Although in our study, NDM-harboring E. cloacae isolates appeared to spread clonally, the spread of carbapenem resistance in K. pneumoniae seems to be plasmid mediated.
