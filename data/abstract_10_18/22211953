Helicobacter pylori in Vladivostok, Far Eastern Russia, was investigated during 2004 to 2009. The genotype cagA(+) vacA(+) (s1/m1 or m2) accounted for 74.7%, with cagA(-) vacA(+) (s2/m2) at 11.2%. The CagA EPIYA type was mainly Western ABC, with minor types (ABCCC and novel AAABC) or non-Western/non-East Asia type (AB). Regarding drug resistance, metronidazole resistance was the highest, with a marked decrease in 6 years (from 71.4% to 30.8%); in contrast, levofloxacin and clarithromycin resistance increased. The data indicate that in Vladivostok, H. pylori was mainly the Western (not East Asian) type and dynamic changes in drug resistance occurred during 6 years.
