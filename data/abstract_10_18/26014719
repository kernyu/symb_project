WAC04657 is a wild-isolate Streptomyces that has antibiotic activities against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. From a solid-agar culture of this organism we isolated 13-deoxytetrodecamycin, a novel antibacterial molecule. It is one of at least three distinct antimicrobial compounds produced by this strain. The molecule has the molecular formula C18H22O5 and is related to the previously discovered compound tetrodecamycin. 13-Deoxytetrodecamycin has potent bioactivity against Gram-positive pathogens including multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
