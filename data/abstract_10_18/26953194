An extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing and colistin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolate was recovered from a patient who was treated with cefotaxime. This isolate harbored a blaCTX-M-15 ESBL gene that was associated with an ISEcp1 insertion sequence. Transposition of that tandem occurred within the chromosomal mgrB gene, leading to inactivation of the mgrB gene and consequently to acquired resistance to colistin. We showed here a coselection of colistin resistance as a result of a broad-spectrum cephalosporin selective pressure.
