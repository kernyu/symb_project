BACKGROUND: Gonorrhoea and widely spread antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in its etiological agent Neisseria gonorrhoeae are major public health concerns worldwide. Gonococcal AMR surveillance nationally and internationally, to identify emerging resistance and inform treatment guidelines, is imperative for public health purposes. In 2009, AMR surveillance was initiated in Belarus, Eastern Europe because no gonococcal AMR data had been available for at least two decades. Herein, the prevalence and trends of gonococcal AMR and molecular epidemiological characteristics of N. gonorrhoeae strains from 2010 to 2013 in Belarus, are described. METHODS: N. gonorrhoeae isolates (n=193) obtained in the Mogilev (n=142), Minsk (n=36) and Vitebsk (n=15) regions of Belarus in 2010 (n=72), 2011 (n=6), 2012 (n=75) and 2013 (n=40) were analyzed in regards to AMR using the Etest method and for molecular epidemiology with N. gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequence typing (NG-MAST). RESULTS: During 2010-2013, the proportions of resistant N. gonorrhoeae isolates were as follows: tetracycline 36%, ciprofloxacin 28%, penicillin G 9%, azithromycin 5%, and cefixime 0.5%. Only one (0.5%) beta-lactamase producing isolate was detected. No isolates resistant to ceftriaxone and spectinomycin were identified. Overall, the resistance levels to tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and penicillin G were relatively stable. Interestingly, the level of resistance to azithromycin declined from 12% in 2010 to 0% in 2013 (P < 0.05). In total, 70 NG-MAST STs were identified. The predominant STs were ST1993 (n=53), ST807 (n=13), ST285 (n=8) and ST9735 (n=8). Many novel STs (n=43, 61%), representing 41% of all isolates, were found. CONCLUSIONS: During 2010-2013, the N. gonorrhoeae population in Belarus displayed high and relatively stable resistance levels to tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, and penicillin G, while the resistance to azithromycin declined. One isolate was resistant to cefixime, but no resistance to ceftriaxone or spectinomycin was found. The results of the present surveillance initiated in 2009 were also used to replace penicillin G with ceftriaxone (1 g single dose intramuscularly) as the first-line drug for empiric treatment of gonorrhoea in the national treatment guidelines in Belarus in late 2009. It is essential to further strengthen the surveillance of gonococcal AMR and ideally survey also treatment failures and molecular epidemiological genotypes in Belarus.
