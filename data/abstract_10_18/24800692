Genome level analysis of bacterial strains provides information on genetic composition and resistance mechanisms to clinically relevant antibiotics. To date, whole genome characterization of linezolid-resistant Enterococcus faecalis isolated in the clinic is lacking. In this study, we report the entire genome sequence, genomic characteristics and virulence factors of a pathogenic E. faecalis strain, DENG1. Our results showed considerable differences in genomic characteristics and virulence factors compared with other E. faecalis strains (V583 and OG1RF). The genome of this LZD-resistant E. faecalis strain can be used as a reference to study the mechanism of LZD resistance and the phylogenetic relationship of E. faecalis strains worldwide.
