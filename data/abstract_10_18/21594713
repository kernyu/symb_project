Despite the availability of newer classes of antibiotics, infection with multi-drug-resistant bacteria is a serious problem. To suppress the appearance of multi-drug-resistant bacteria and to avoid severe infection derived from febrile neutropenia (FN), we conducted cycling the administration of antibiotics for FN in patients with hematological malignancy. The treatment protocol consisted of the administration of four antibiotics each for 3 months in 1 year. The above regimen was repeated for 4 years. A total of 193 patients were registered in the protocol. The mean duration of the administration of cycling antibiotics was 5.9 days (range: 1-16 days). The frequency of FN before the study and during the study was unchanged until the third year, but decreased significantly in the fourth year. The frequency of detection of multi-drug-resistant bacteria in the first year was the same as that before the study was started, but dramatically decreased after the second year. Bacteriological treatment success rates were similar in each trimester and each year. The effective rate was not statistically different in each trimester and each year. We conclude that cycling the administration of antibiotics in patients with FN is useful for suppressing the appearance of multi-drug-resistant bacteria and for obtaining excellent clinical efficacy.
