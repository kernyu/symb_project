Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsy is currently considered the standard technique for obtaining tissue to make a histological diagnosis of prostatic carcinoma. Infectious complications following TRUS-guided prostate biopsy are well described, and are reportedly increasing in incidence. The role of antibiotic prophylaxis in reducing post-TRUS biopsy infections is now established, and many guidelines suggest that fluoroquinolone antimicrobials are the prophylactic agents of choice. Of note, however, recent reports suggest an emerging association between TRUS biopsy and subsequent infection with fluoroquinolone-resistant Escherichia coli. Against this background, we provide an overview of the epidemiology, prevention, and treatment of infectious complications following TRUS biopsy, in the wider context of increasing global antimicrobial resistance.
