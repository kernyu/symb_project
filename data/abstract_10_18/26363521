Several human HLA alleles have been found associated with type 1 diabetes (T1D), but their precise role is not clearly defined. Herein, we report that a human MHC class II (HLA-DR*0401) allele transgene that has been expressed into NOD (H-2(g7)I-E(null)) mice prone to T1D rendered the mice resistant to the disease. T1D resistance occurred in the context of multi-point T-cell alterations such as: (i) skewed CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio, (ii) decreased size of CD4(+)CD44(high) T memory pool, (iii) aberrant TCR Vbeta repertoire, (iv) increased neonatal number of Foxp3(+) and TR-1(+) regulatory cells, and (v) reduced IFN-gamma inflammatory response vs. enhanced IL-10 suppressogenic response of T-cells upon polyclonal and antigen-specific stimulation. The T-cells from NOD/DR4 Tg mice were unable to induce or suppress diabetes in NOD/RAG deficient mice. This study describes a multifaceted regulatory function of the HLA-DR*0401 allele strongly associated with the lack of T1D development in NOD mice.
