The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of clinical and epidemiological characteristics of 183 HIV/HCV coinfected patients and HCV clearance after antiviral treatment on serum sFas and sFasL levels. Thirty out of 183 patients underwent HCV antiviral therapy with IFN-alpha + RBV for a duration of 48 weeks. HCV genotype 1 and homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) had a significant positive relationship, and CD4+/muL had a significant negative relationship with sFas (R-square = 0.582; p < 0.001) and sFasL (R-square = 0.216; p < 0.001) in multivariate linear regression analysis. HCV genotype 1 was the only significant variable associated with the sFas/sFasL ratio (R-square = 0.201; p < 0.001). sFas and sFasL levels had positive significant correlations with serum sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, and HOMA levels (p < 0.05). Among patients on IFN-alpha + RBV therapy, 15 patients showed a sustained virologic response (SVR), while 15 patients were non-responders (NR). Patients with SVR had significant decreases in sFas (p = 0.008) and sFas/sFasL ratio (p = 0.002), while non-responders had a significant increase in sFasL values (p = 0.013). In conclusion, HCV genotype 1, high HOMA, and low CD4+/muL were associated with high serum levels of sFas and sFasL, which indicate higher levels of inflammation and, possibly, increased cardiovascular risk. Moreover, response to HCV antiviral therapy is known to reduce inflammation.
