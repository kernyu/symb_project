Infections are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in liver transplant (LT) recipients. We studied timeline, spectrum of infection, system involved, and antimicrobial resistance in 64 patients undergoing live donor LT with 6-month follow-up. Of 64 patients, 38 (59.5%) patients had 103 infectious episodes, 10 patients had single infectious episode and 28 patients had two or more infectious episodes. 96 (93.2%) were bacterial and Candida infections were in 7 (6.8%). Early phase had 30 (29.1%) episodes; intermediate phase 25 (24.2%) and late phase 48 (46.6%). Mortality was 11/64 (17.1%). Knowledge of timeline, aetiological agent and antimicrobial resistance is useful to guide empirical therapy and infection prevention.
