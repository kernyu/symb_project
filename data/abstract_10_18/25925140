To evaluate the effect from low-level exposure of antibiotics on the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes, unpolluted arable soils were treated with oxytetracycline (OTC)-containing manure, with OTC (0, 2, 20, or 70 mug kg(-1)) added every 2 weeks on 10 occasions. Six tetracycline resistance genes [TRGs-tet(A), tet(L), tet(M), tet(Q), tet(O), and tet(W)] and the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene were monitored using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The relative abundance of tet(A), tet(L), tet(M), and tet(Q) genes in soil increased 10-1000 times after application of OTC-containing manure. Tet(A) abundance per unit of residual OTC on day 140 was 1.53-4.42 times higher than that on day 28, while tet(L) abundance was 1.04-1.74 times higher. Treatment with >40 mug kg(-1) OTC significantly increased abundance of tet(A) and tet(L), while tet(M) and tet(Q) abundance was positively correlated (R (2) = 0.965 and 0.932, p < 0.01) with residual OTC concentrations. There was a significant accumulation of TRGs associated with low-level OTC exposure in arable soils. Besides OTC residual, the effects from exposure time and application frequencies should also be considered to limit the increase in abundance of tet(A) and tet(L).
