We report here a draft genome sequence of Enterococcus faecalis strain F165 isolated from a urine specimen in South Brazil. The genome size was 3,049,734 bp, with a G+C content of 37.38%, and genes related to antimicrobial resistance and adherence were found in the strain. These findings are consistent with pathogenesis of E. faecalis species.
