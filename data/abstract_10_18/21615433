AIMS: This study was carried out to find the prevalence of various plasmid-mediated quinolone-resistant (PMQR) determinants among the quinolone-resistant clinical isolates of Shigella sp. from paediatric patients in Andaman & Nicobar Islands. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 106 quinolone-resistant Shigella isolates obtained from paediatric patients during hospital-based surveillance from January 2003 to June 2010 were screened for the presence of various PMQR determinants. Of 106 isolates, 8 (7.5%) showed the presence of aac (6')-Ib-cr and 3 (2.8%) harboured the qnrB genes with 2 (1.9%) of these isolates showing the presence of both. All the 9 isolates had uniform mutations in gyrA (S83L) and in parC (S80I). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of fluoroquinolone-acetylating aminoglycoside acetyltransferase {aac (6')-Ib-cr} gene is higher than qnrB gene among the clinical Shigella isolates. These PMQR determinants were detected in the Shigella isolates obtained from 2008-2010, indicating that it happens in a stepwise manner following the multiple mutations in quinolone resistance-determining regions increase or extend resistance to quinolones or fluoroquinolones. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: The prevalence of these genes are of grave concern as it may be horizontally transferred to other human pathogenic bacteria and can lead to therapeutic failure as a consequence of antimicrobial resistance, not only for the islands but also for the entire south-east region. The results obtained should encourage further studies on the implications of the presence, distribution, association and variation of these determinants in our quest for understanding PMQR.
