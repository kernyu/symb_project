Bacterial resistance to antimicrobial drugs has become a global health crisis. Physicians and veterinarians are embracing the concept of 'antimicrobial stewardship' (AMS) to preserve the efficacy of antibiotics for future generations. Antimicrobials are used in laboratory animals to treat clinical disease, to protect populations that may be vulnerable to infection, and in research projects including studies of the microbiome and to influence expression in genetically engineered animals. This overview provides a critical look at the use of antimicrobials in contemporary vivaria, with special attention to rodents because they are the most commonly used species in research and because antimicrobial use in rodents is not straightforward. Improvements in antibiotic use are encouraged with the goal of decreasing bacterial resistance while continuing to provide quality clinical care and research support. Suggestions are framed by using the 5 Rs: Reduce, Refine, Replace, and Review antimicrobial use in the vivarium, and take Responsibility for the judicious use of antibiotics in research animals.
