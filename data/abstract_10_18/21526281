Antimicrobial resistance is an increasing public health issue. Creation of surveillance networks is a matter of major importance for antimicrobial resistance understanding and monitoring. Also, they contribute to design actions for controlling its appearance and dissemination. In 2007 a colaborative group in antimicrobial resistance was formed, representing several health institutions across the country. In this paper we report the results of 2009 surveillance with emphasis in its interpretation, limitations and future perspectives.
