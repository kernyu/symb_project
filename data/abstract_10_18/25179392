Urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria have become a growing problem limiting therapeutic options. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical and microbiological efficacy of amikacin treatment in adult patients with lower UTIs due to ESBL-producing Escherichia coli (Ec) or Klebsiella pneumonia (Kp). We conducted a retrospective study of 36 outpatients aged >18 years with dysuria or problems with frequency or urgency in passing urine; pyuria and a positive urine culture (10(5) cfu/ml) for ESBL producing Ec or Kp which is also resistant to nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, quinolones and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, between January 2013 and February 2014. Patients received intramuscular amikacin 15 mg/kg/day for 10 days. Clinical success was defined as disappearance of symptoms. Bacteriological success was defined as sterile control urine cultures. 58.3% of patients were female. Age range was 18-89 years. All of the patients had at least one complicating factor. 77.8% of the isolates were E. coli. Clinical success rate was 97.2%. Overall bacteriological success rates were 91.7% on the 3 day of treatment, 97.1% at the end of the treatment and 94.1% on the 7-10 days after treatment. After 28-32 days following the treatment, reinfection was found in 12% whereas relapse was not determined. Nephrotoxicity was developed in one patient. The clinicians should keep in mind that amikacin treatment is an efficient and safe alternative treatment option before the carbapenem treatment especially in patients with lower UTIs caused by ESBL-producing Ec or Kp that are resistant to all oral antibiotics.
