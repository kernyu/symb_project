Copy number variation (CNV) has been reported to be associated with chemotherapy response, which affects disease prognosis. Here, we determined the frequency of genome-wide cytogenetic CNV aberrations in Korean patients with normal karyotype (NK) acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and tested whether these genomic variations contribute to differences in Ara-C and anthracycline-based chemotherapy responses. Bone marrow aspirates and blood from 30 previously untreated de novo NK-AML patients were provided at the time of diagnosis for copy number analysis. Possible associations between cytogenetic aberrations and clinical parameters were analysed. CNVs were identified in 23 (76.7%) of the 30 cases tested. Multivariate analyses controlled for other clinical co-variates showed that patients having copy number loss had a decreased probability of complete remission (OR, 0.015 [95% CI, 0-0.737], p = 0.035). Patients who had a copy number gain of more than four regions tended to have shorter event-free survival (EFS) (p = 0.083) with multivariate analysis showing that CNV increase is an independent predictive factor for shorter EFS (HR, 22.104 [95% CI, 1.644-297.157], p = 0.020). In addition, we identified candidate genes that may be involved in Ara-C and anthracycline drug response in Korean patients with NK-AML. These results suggest that CNVs may affect the success of Ara-C and anthracycline-based chemotherapy in Korean patients with NK-AML.
