Eggerthella lenta is a Gram-positive anaerobic bacillus. Improved diagnostics and increased awareness of rare pathogens have revealed its potential to cause serious invasive infections. In this study, 18 clinical E. lenta isolates derived from positive blood cultures were included. Underlying problems of the patients were in the majority of cases related to the gastrointestinal tract. The performance of two MALDI-TOF MS systems, i.e. Bruker and Vitek MS, in identification of E. lenta was analyzed. In addition, the minimal inhibitory concentrations for clinically relevant antimicrobial agents were determined by routine procedures using E-test. 17 of the 18 E. lenta isolates investigated in this study were correctly identified to species level by the Bruker MS system, while the Vitek MS system identified all 18 isolates. Antimicrobial sensitivity towards the tested agents was in general good. However, high resistance rates were observed for penicillin G and piperacillin-tazobactam based on EUCAST breakpoints.
