Recently, several studies indicated that senescent tumor cells are resistant to apoptosis in chemotherapy. They may return to cell cycle, thus act as stumbling blocks in anticancer treatments. In the present study, we found that, in human colorectal cancer cells, low-dose camptothecin (CPT) simultaneously induced autophagy and premature senescence through AMPK-TSC2-mTOR pathway and ATM-Chk2-p53-p21 pathway respectively. What's important is the suppression of autophagy substantially increased apoptosis and greatly attenuated senescence possibly by blocking p53/p21 pathway, which suggests that autophagy plays an indispensable role in sustaining cell senescence caused by low-dose CPT. The combination of low-dose CPT and autophagy inhibitor, a way to lead senescent cells to die, would be potentially valuable in cancer therapy.
