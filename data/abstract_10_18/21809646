AIM: Evaluation of composite formulation of yeast double stranded RNA with polyglucinum (dsRNA-PG) effect on non-specific antiviral resistance factors in mice in comparison with commercial formulation Ridostin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: dsRNA and Ridostin formulations were injected intramuscularly once at the dose of 5 mg/ml, polyglucinum--at the dose of 3.75 mg/ml. 3, 5, 24, 48 and 72 hours after the injection serum interferon levels, neutrophil oxidation-reduction activity parameters, peritoneal macrophage phagocyte activity levels were analyzed in mice blood samples. RESULTS: New dsRNA and polyglucinum containing composite formulation is a non-specific resistance system stimulator. dsRNA-PG effect on interferon synthesis and mice phagocyte activity was higher than with Ridostin and developed earlier. Neutrophil function activation by the formulation had a prolonged effect. A possible explanation for increased activity of dsRNA and polyglucinum composite formulation is a modulating effect by the polysaccharide component. CONCLUSION: The new formulation may have a more intensive and prolonged protective effect against influenza virus in comparison with Ridostin.
