OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to analyse whether there is an association between reduced susceptibility to biocides in Acinetobacter baumannii and (i) antimicrobial resistance (co-resistance), (ii) prevalent (epidemic) clones, (iii) changes in the fitness or (iv) expression of genes related to efflux pumps and porins. METHODS: Susceptibility to biocides and antimicrobials was determined in 49 clonally unrelated isolates of A. baumannii. Biological cost, in terms of mean generation time, was determined by spectrophotometry. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was used to determine the relative expression of genes encoding several efflux pumps and porins. RESULTS: Reduced susceptibility to chlorhexidine digluconate, benzalkonium chloride and Irgasan((R)) was associated with resistance to aminoglycosides, tetracycline and ciprofloxacin (P < 0.05). The MICs of carbapenems, aminoglycosides, doxycycline and ciprofloxacin for isolate Ab70 (epidemic clone) exposed to these biocides increased by >/=2 dilutions. Reduced susceptibility to Orsan((R)) was more frequent among prevalent clones than non-prevalent clones (P < 0.05). Mean generation times for Ab70 before and after exposure to benzalkonium chloride were 57.8 and 78.1 min, respectively (P = 0.02). Relative expression of abeS and adeB was increased in Ab46 and Ab70 after exposure to chlorhexidine digluconate, but was decreased for ompA and carO after exposure to Irgasan((R)). CONCLUSIONS: Reduced susceptibility to biocides is associated with co-resistance to carbapenems, aminoglycosides, tetracycline and ciprofloxacin. Reduced susceptibility to Orsan((R)) may be a marker of prevalent clones. Acquisition of reduced susceptibility to benzalkonium chloride has a biological cost. Exposure to biocides affects the relative expression of genes related to some efflux pump genes (increased expression) or porins (reduced expression).
