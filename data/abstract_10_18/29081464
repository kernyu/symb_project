We isolated Enterococcus species that colonized in the African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) in order to investigate their genetic relatedness and antimicrobial susceptibility. A total of 219 isolates were obtained and a 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed they were classified into Enterococcus avium, E. casseliflavus, E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. hirae, or E. mundtii. Multilocus sequence typing of E. faecalis and E. faecium isolates indicated that some of the isolates showed an evolutionary distance that was far from the primary founders. The antimicrobial susceptibility of the enterococcal isolates suggested that the significant transmission of antimicrobial resistance via human intervention had not yet occurred.
