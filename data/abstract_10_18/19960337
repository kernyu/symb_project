MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains are isolated from clinical specimens with increasing frequency. It seems that acquiring genes which determine antibiotic resistance usually comes at a biological cost of impaired bacterial physiology. There is no information on investigations comparing phenotypic differences in MDR and MDS P. aeruginosa strains in literature. The study included 150 clinical P. aeruginosa isolates (75 classified as MDS and 75 as MDR). PFGE analysis revealed five pairs of identical isolates in the group of MDR strains and the results obtained for these strains were not included in the statistical analyses. MDR strains adhered to polystyrene to a lesser extent than MDS strains. The growth rate in the liquid medium was significantly lower for MDR strains. Detectable amounts of alginate were present in the culture supernatants of seven MDS and six MDR strains. The MDR P. aeruginosa strains which were investigated produced significantly lower amounts of extracellular material binding Congo Red, lower lipolytic, elastase, LasA protease, phospholipase C activity and pyocyanin quantity in culture supernatants when compared with MDS strains. No significant differences were observed between MDR and MDS strains in proteolytic activity. In conclusion, the MDR P. aeruginosa strains have impaired virulence when compared to MDS strains.
