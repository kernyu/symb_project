The growing prevalence of resistant Gram-positive pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus continues to pose a dilemma to clinicians. With strains developing reduced susceptibility to vancomycin, effective and well-tolerated antibiotics to combat these resistant pathogens are needed. Ceftaroline is a new parenteral cephalosporin that has been available in the USA for almost 2 years. Similar to other cephalosporins, it is well tolerated with mostly mild adverse events; however, compared with existing parenteral cephalosporins, ceftaroline has the unique attribute of being bactericidal against resistant Gram-positive aerobes including both hospital- and community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus, S. aureus strains with reduced susceptibility or complete resistance to vancomycin, and resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae including multidrug-resistant strains. Current indications in the USA and Europe include treatment of adults with complicated skin, skin-structure infections and community-acquired pneumonia. This paper will review the properties of ceftaroline, its spectrum of activity, clinical use, safety profile and future role.
