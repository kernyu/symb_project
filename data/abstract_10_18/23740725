In recent years, different resistance genes have been found in Acinetobacter spp., especially in the species A. baumannii. We describe two isolates of carbapenem-resistant A. nosocomialis harboring ISAba1-blaOXA-23 and blaOXA-51 found in patients from the city of Porto Alegre, southern Brazil. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of carbapenem-resistant A. nosocomialis in Latin America.
