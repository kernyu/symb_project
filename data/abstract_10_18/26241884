Cisplatin is a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent; however, the development of acquired resistance limits its application. Here, we demonstrate that 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) enhanced the antitumor effects of cisplatin in SKOV3 cells, which include inhibition of proliferation and promotion of apoptosis. Additionally, either cisplatin or 2-DG alone could upregulate the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-associated protein glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78). Moreover, exposure to 2-DG increased the expression of GRP78 induced by cisplatin. Cisplatin also upregulated ER stress-associated apoptotic protein 153/C/EBP homology protein (CHOP) in SKOV3 cells. While treatment with 2-DG alone could not upregulate the CHOP expression, a combination of both 2-DG and cisplatin increased the protein levels of CHOP above those induced by Cisplatin alone. Finally, cisplatin mediated an increase in ATP stores within acidic vesicles, whereas 2-DG decreased this effect. These data demonstrate that 2-DG sensitizes SKOV3 cells to cisplatin by increasing ER stress and decreasing ATP stores in acidic vesicles.
