BACKGROUND: The incidence of nosocomial infections caused by multi-drug- and extended-drug resistant strains of Acinetobacter is constantly increasing all over the world, with a high mortality rate. We analyzed the in-hospital data on the sensitivity of Acinetobacter baumannii isolates and correlated them with antibiotic treatment and clinical outcomes of nosocomial infections over a 17-mo period. METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed at the Clinical Center "Bezanijska kosa," Belgrade, Serbia. Microbiologic data (number and sensitivity of A. baumannii isolates) and clinical data (medical records of 41 randomly selected patients who developed nosocomial infection caused by A. baumannii) were matched. RESULTS: Acinetobacter baumannii, detected in 279 isolates and obtained from 19 patients (12% of all samples), was resistant to almost all antibiotics tested, including carbapenems, with the exception of colistin and tigecycline. It was obtained most often from the respiratory tract samples. Empiric treatment of the nosocomial infections (pneumonia in 75% of cases) involved cephalosporins, metronidazole, and carbapenems (80%, 66%, and 61% of patients, respectively), whereas tigecyclin and colistin were used primarily in targeted therapy (20% and 12% of patients, respectively). The mortality rate of patients treated empirically was significantly higher (p < 0.01), reaching 100% in the elderly. CONCLUSIONS: Nosocomial A. baumannii infections represent a significant clinical problem because of their high incidence, lack of susceptibility to the most commonly used antibiotics, and the often inappropriate treatment, which favors the development of multi-drug-resistant strains.
