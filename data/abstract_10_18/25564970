1. Influx and efflux proteins play a major role in the overall uptake and efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents and cellular chemo-resistance. 2. The present study investigated the time course and dose dependency of the induction of three efflux proteins, P-gp, MRP1 and MRP5, in response to gemcitabine exposure in Capan-2 pancreatic cancer cell line at transcriptional and translational levels. The influence of exposure on the influx protein (ENT1), the net cellular uptake of the gemcitabine, the overall ATPase activity and the cell death rate were also measured. 3. The time course of the expression exhibited an initial rise, toward a plateau level. The estimated Km and Vmax confirmed that MRP5 and to a lesser extent MRP1 are the prominent proteins for efflux of gemcitabine. Both mRNA and protein expression demonstrated the time and concentration dependency of the induction; and the elevated ATPase activity validated that the induced efflux proteins are functionally active. 4. The results of the study revealed that the efficacy window of gemcitabine as it relates to the function of the efflux proteins is concentration and temporal dependent and is well correlated to the first 60 min of exposure.
