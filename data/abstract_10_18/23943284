The role of mitochondria in the inherited or ontogenetically acquired reactions of organism to stress is not studied enough. In the present work, we examined the functional state of the coupled respiratory chain, potassium and calcium transport and rate of hydrogen peroxide production on two rat lines: August and Wistar-which possess different resistance to emotional stress and hypoxia. It was established that the respiration rate and efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation were higher in August rats than in Wistar ones. In August rats, the rate of potassium transport and ATP-dependent mitochondrial swelling as well as the concentration of the ion in the mitochondrial matrix were almost twice as higher comparatively to those parameters in Wistar rats. The rate of H2O2 production was found to be decreased in the mitochondria of August rats. It was also demonstrated that the two rat lines differed by their resistance to the opening of the palmitate/Ca(2+)-induced pore and by their ability to retain calcium within mitochondria. The paper discusses the involvement of the mitochondrial ATP-dependent potassium channel in the adaptation of animals to adverse effects.
