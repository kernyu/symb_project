Among the 219 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium isolates collected in 20 Taiwanese hospitals from 2006 to 2010, all were susceptible to linezolid and daptomycin, and 98.6% were susceptible to tigecycline. There was a shift toward higher tigecycline MIC values (MIC(90)s) from 2006-2007 (0.06 mug/ml) to 2008-2010 (0.12 mug/ml). The MIC(90)s of daptomycin and linezolid remained stationary. Although pulsotypes among the isolates from the 20 hospitals varied, intrahospital spreading of several clones was identified in 13 hospitals.
