OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antimicrobial resistance and resistance profiles of Salmonella isolates, from the pork production chain in several districts of Sichuan province and to determine the correlation between serotype and the pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns. METHODS: From 2010 to 2011, a total of 112 Salmonella isolates from pork production chain were examined for their antimicrobial susceptibility, using the micro-dilution method against 10 antimicrobial agents. RESULTS: were assessed by the standard by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, 2010). In addition, PFGE patterns were investigated among the Salmonella strains from different sources, under different serovars and antimicrobial profiles. RESULTS: For Salmonella isolated from the pork production chain, resistance to tetracycline (89.29%) was frequently observed. Many isolates were resistant to spectinomycin (36.61%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (35.71%), nalidixic acid (33.93%) and ampicillin (24.11%), but all of the isolates were susceptible to ceftiofur. 33.93% of the isolates were multi-drug resistant. Salmonella isolates from the pork production chain had 19 antibiotic resistance profiles. Totally, 34 PFGE patterns were detected among 74 Salmonella isolates from the pork production chain, with the PFGE patterns of the 74 Salmonella isolates sharing 40% to 100% similarities. CONCLUSION: The antimicrobial resistances of the Salmonella isolates were commonly detected from the pork production chain in Sichuan province suggesting that Salmonella might horizontally spread from food animals to retail meat products.
