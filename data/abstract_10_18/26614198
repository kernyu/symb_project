SETTING: High-resolution melting curve analysis (HRMA) can be used to screen for mutations in genes without the need for specific probes, with low turnaround time and high cost-effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: To detect the sensitivity and specificity of a line-probe assay (LPA) and HRMA in comparison with BACTEC MGIT 960 for the detection of rifampicin (RMP) resistance. DESIGN: A total of 219 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates tested by MGIT 960 for RMP susceptibility were tested with HRMA and LPA. Discordant samples were processed for sequencing of the RMP resistance-determining region (RRDR) of the rpoB gene. RESULTS: HRMA identified 93 of 103 (90.3%) isolates that were resistant and 113/116 (97.4%) that were susceptible on MGIT 960, with a sensitivity and specificity of respectively 90.3% and 97.4%. HRMA identified 117/119 (98.3%) LPA-susceptible and 94/100 (94%) resistant isolates, with 98.3% specificity and 94% sensitivity. Two isolates that were susceptible on LPA but resistant on HRMA showed silent mutations at 539 and 541 codons on sequencing, while 6 isolates that were susceptible on HRMA but resistant on LPA showed D516V (n = 4) and H526C/D (n = 2) mutations. Four isolates (3.9%) that were resistant on MGIT were susceptible on all three genotypic methods, which could be due to mutations outside the RRDR or efflux pumps. CONCLUSION: HRMA shows good potential as a rapid screening tool for the detection of drug resistance.
