The interest in nanotechnology and the growing concern for the antibiotic resistance demonstrated by many microorganisms have recently stimulated many efforts in designing innovative biomaterials and substrates with antibacterial properties. Among the implemented strategies to control the incidence of infections associated with the use of biomedical device and implants, interesting routes are represented by the incorporation of bactericidal agents onto the surface of biomaterials for the prevention of bacterial adhesion and biofilm growth. Natural products and particularly bioactive metals such as silver, copper and zinc represent an interesting alternative for the development of advanced biomaterials with antimicrobial properties. This review presents an overview of recent progress in the modification of biomaterials as well as the most attractive techniques for the deposition of antimicrobial coatings on different substrates for biomedical application. Moreover, some research activities and results achieved by the authors in the development of antibacterial materials are also presented and discussed.
