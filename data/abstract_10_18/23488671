BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Blood-stage Plasmodium parasites cause morbidity and mortality from malaria. Parasite resistance to drugs makes development of new chemotherapies an urgency. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have been validated as antimalarial drug targets. We explored long-term effects of borrelidin and mupirocin in lethal P. yoelii murine malaria. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Long-term (up to 340 days) immunological responses to borrelidin or mupirocin were measured after an initial 4 day suppressive test. Prophylaxis and cure were evaluated and the inhibitory effect on the parasites analysed. KEY RESULTS: Borrelidin protected against lethal malaria at 0.25 mg.kg(-)(1).day(-)(1). Antimalarial activity of borrelidin correlated with accumulation of trophozoites in peripheral blood. All infected mice treated with borrelidin survived and subsequently developed immunity protecting them from re-infection on further challenges, 75 and 340 days after the initial infection. This long-term immunity in borrelidin-treated mice resulted in negligible parasitaemia after re-infections and marked increases in total serum levels of antiparasite IgGs with augmented avidity. Long-term memory IgGs mainly reacted against high and low molecular weight parasite antigens. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that circulating IgGs bound predominantly to late intracellular stage parasites, mainly schizonts. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Low borrelidin doses protected mice from lethal malaria infections and induced protective immune responses after treatment. Development of combination therapies with borrelidin and selective modifications of the borrelidin molecule to specifically inhibit plasmodial threonyl tRNA synthetase should improve therapeutic strategies for malaria.
