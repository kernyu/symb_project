Metal homeostasis plays a critical role in antioxidative stress. Streptococcus oligofermentans, an oral commensal facultative anaerobe lacking catalase activity, produces and tolerates abundant H2O2, whereas Dpr (an Fe(2+)-chelating protein)-dependent H2O2 protection does not confer such high tolerance. Here, we report that inactivation of perR, a peroxide-responsive repressor that regulates zinc and iron homeostasis in Gram-positive bacteria, increased the survival of H2O2-pulsed S. oligofermentans 32-fold and elevated cellular manganese 4.5-fold. perR complementation recovered the wild-type phenotype. When grown in 0.1 to 0.25 mM MnCl2, S. oligofermentans increased survival after H2O2 stress 2.5- to 23-fold, and even greater survival was found for the perR mutant, indicating that PerR is involved in Mn(2+)-mediated H2O2 resistance in S. oligofermentans. Mutation of mntA could not be obtained in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth (containing ~0.4 muM Mn(2+)) unless it was supplemented with >/=2.5 muM MnCl2 and caused 82 to 95% reduction of the cellular Mn(2+) level, while mntABC overexpression increased cellular Mn(2+) 2.1- to 4.5-fold. Thus, MntABC was identified as a high-affinity Mn(2+) transporter in S. oligofermentans. mntA mutation reduced the survival of H2O2-pulsed S. oligofermentans 5.7-fold, while mntABC overexpression enhanced H2O2-challenged survival 12-fold, indicating that MntABC-mediated Mn(2+) uptake is pivotal to antioxidative stress in S. oligofermentans. perR mutation or H2O2 pulsing upregulated mntABC, while H2O2-induced upregulation diminished in the perR mutant. This suggests that perR represses mntABC expression but H2O2 can release the suppression. In conclusion, this work demonstrates that PerR regulates manganese homeostasis in S. oligofermentans, which is critical to H2O2 stress defenses and may be distributed across all oral streptococci lacking catalase.
