We examined the involvement of peroxiredoxin 6 (Prdx 6) in providing chemoprotection against cisplatin cytotoxicity in SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells. Treatment of SKOV-3 cells with cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity that was associated with increased accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis mediated by proteolytically activated caspase 3 and 9. Overexpression of Prdx 6 protein or exposure to N-acetylcysteine (NAC) reversed the apoptotic effect of cisplatin by reducing ROS levels and suppressing the caspase signaling pathway. These results indicate that targeting Prdx 6 may sensitize cancer cells to ROS-producing therapeutic treatments, such as anticancer drugs and radiation.
