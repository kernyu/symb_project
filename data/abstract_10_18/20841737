Bacterial antimicrobial resistance in both the medical and agricultural fields has become a serious problem worldwide. Antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria are an increasing threat to human health, with resistance mechanisms having been described to all known antimicrobials currently available for clinical use. Monitoring the geotemporal variations of antibiotic resistance pattern is crucial factor in planning a successful therapeutic guidelines preventing further emergence of antibiotic resistance. This study is based on the retrospective spatiotemporal analysis of laboratory results of Antibiotic Sensitivity Tests, time stamped with the date and time of the microbiological specimen dispatched to the laboratory. Geographic location of the isolated bacterial colony is specified with the latitude and the longitude of the patient's location. Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering was performed on antimicrobial resistance findings based on the geographic locations generating series of Heatmaps to visualize the extent of the resistance pattern. Sequential Hierarchical cluster analysis was proven to be effective in visualization of antibiotic resistance using Heatmaps demonstrating the temporal variations of the antibiotic resistance patterns.
