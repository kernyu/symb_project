Two new triterpenes, 17(21)-hopene-6alpha,12beta-diol (1) and 17(21)-hopen-12beta-ol (2), the known 17(21)-hopen-6alpha-ol (zeorinin, 3), and two new biarylic dihydronaphthopyrones, aschernaphthopyrones A (4) and B (5), were isolated from the scale insect pathogenic fungus Aschersonia paraphysata BCC 11964. Hopene 1 and aschernaphthopyrone A (4) exhibited antimalarial activity with IC(50) values of 15 and 7.3 microM, respectively.
