Nitric oxide (NO) is a diatomic gas that is synthesized within and released by multiple host cell types functioning to provide a variety of physiologic and homeostatic effects. Nitric oxide exhibits a variety of effects that relate significantly with outcomes that can provide therapeutic benefit if properly formulated and released. These include anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antimicrobial, vasodilatory properties, and effects that are beneficial to wound healing. Lack of antibiotic resistance appears to be one major advantage of topically delivered NO. A specific topical formulation of NO has been developed that has been shown thus far in clinical studies to exhibit favorable efficacy and safety. This article provides a thorough review of the biologic effects of NO, discusses modes of action and potential pharmacologic benefits, and reviews currently available clinical data for acne.
