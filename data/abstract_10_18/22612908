Anthelmintic resistance has emerged globally as a problem amongst nematode of livestock and has been particularly well documented in equine and small ruminants. There are no studies regarding the efficacy of anthelmintics against the hematophagous nematodes in ostriches, Libyostrongylus dentatus; and just a few on L. douglassii. Here the efficacy of albendazole, ivermectin and moxidectin were evaluated against these two species in an ostrich farm in Minas Gerais state, Brazil. The feces were collected on the day of treatment and after 13 days of an oral dose of albendazole (6 mg/kg), or an injected dose (0.2mg/kg) of ivermectin or moxidectin. The fecal egg count reduction test and coprocultures were performed to determine possible resistance against the drugs used. An efficacy of 60% was found for ivermectin, while albendazole and moxidectin were 100% effective. Both worm species appeared to have reduced sensitivity to ivermectin.
