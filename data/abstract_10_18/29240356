The FilmArray Blood Culture Identification (FA-BCID) panel is a multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based rapid diagnostic test that can detect 24 sepsis-related pathogens (bacteria and yeast) and three antimicrobial resistance genes in patients with suspected sepsis. An initial blood culture is still required, as the FA-BCID panel must be performed on blood cultures that have tested positive (indicating initial microbial growth). The FA-BCID panel can identify specific pathogens from positive blood cultures with a turnaround time of approximately one hour; this is significantly faster than the time required to grow a full blood culture to identify pathogens. The sensitivity and specificity of the FA-BCID panel are well established for organisms included in the panel; however, its primary limitation from a diagnostic standpoint is an inability to detect other pathogens not included in its panel. Used along with antimicrobial stewardship programs, the FA-BCID panel may improve patient outcomes by, for example, reducing the time it takes to receive appropriate antimicrobial therapy and shortening hospital stays. No comprehensive economic evaluations were identified.
