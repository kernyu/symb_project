Treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection is becoming increasingly challenging due largely to the rising rates of antimicrobial resistance and to the relative complexity of treatment regimens. If a reliable test to assess the antimicrobial sensitivity/resistance of H. pylori was readily available, treatment would be more focused and-presumably-more effective. However, antimicrobial sensitivity testing is difficult to obtain in most parts of the United States. Therefore, physicians have to rely on clinical judgment in selecting treatment regimens for their infected patients. The aims of this review are to summarize recent treatment recommendations and to examine available evidence for how we might improve on our current treatment selections. Information on this review is directed primarily toward physicians practicing in the United States.
