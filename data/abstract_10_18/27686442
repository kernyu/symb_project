To retrospectively analyze the efficacy of interferon plus imatinib (IM) in patients with chronic-phase chronic myelogenous leukemia(CML-CP)and ABL kinase domain mutations. The mutation rates of ABL kinase region in patients with Sokal score low, medium and high risk CML-CP were statistically significant (6.25%, 9.42% and 47.06%, P<0.05). The response rates of interferon plus IM versus second-generation TKI in CML-CP with non-T315I ABL kinase domain mutations were comparable (61.11% vs 65.52%, P>0.05). When CML-CP patients with ABL kinase domain mutations were resistant to TKI or not accessible to second-generation TKI, interferon plus IM can be an alternative choice.
