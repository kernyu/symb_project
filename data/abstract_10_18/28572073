The successful use of tigecycline in a 12-month old liver transplant recipient with extensively drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii bacteremia is presented. Tigecycline serum concentrations were monitored to help improve antibiotic efficacy and minimize side effects. A literature review identified 11 additional pediatric cases of A. baumannii infection treated with tigecycline since 2011. Tigecycline treatment should be considered in children with extensively drug-resistant bacterial infections.
