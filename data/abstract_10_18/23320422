Foodborne salmonellosis is an important public health problem worldwide. Most human Salmonella infections occur through the consumption of contaminated food of animal origin. The study reported the first isolation of two Salmonella enterica serovar Oranienburg strains from pork in China with concurrent resistance to ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone. Both isolates also showed resistance to norfloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and chloramphenicol, and an elevated minimal inhibitory concentraton of azithromycin; one strain was also resistant to amikacin, gentamicin, tetracycline, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Salmonella ceftriaxone resistance was due to the production of IncN plasmidborne CTX-M-14 ESBL, and their ciprofloxacin resistance was mediated by target mutations and efflux pump activity. This is the first time that ceftriaxone- and ciprofloxacin-resistant Salmonella was reported in meat products, which may be due to the uses of antibiotics in animal production. The study warrants the continuous surveillance of multidrug-resistant Salmonella in meat products and cautious use of antibiotics in food animals.
