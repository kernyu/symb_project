Fluoroquinolone-resistant staphylococci (FQRS) are primarily selected in the nasal microbiota during fluoroquinolone (FQ) treatment. To gain insight into the dynamics of the emergence of FQRS, 49 hospitalised patients (HPs) and 62 community patients (CPs) treated with FQs were studied. Nasal swabs were collected before (T0), at the end of (T1) and 1 month after (T2) FQ treatment. FQRS were identified by mass spectrometry. Antibiotic resistance was determined. Pre- and post-exposure staphylococci populations were compared phenotypically and by MLST to determine the origin of FQRS. At T0, 33/49 HPs (67%) and 24/62 CPs (39%) carried FQRS (OR=3.3, 95% CI: 1.4-7.9; P<0.001). Among patients with no FQRS at T0, 15/16 HPs (94%) and 16/38 CPs (42%) had FQRS detected at T1 and/or T2 (OR=19.6, 95% CI: 2.5-902; P<0.001). Among FQRS having emerged, co-resistance to meticillin was detected in 87% and 82% of HPs and CPs, respectively. No selection of resistance emerging from the initial microbiota was evidenced. FQRS showed decreased species diversity in favour of Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. As a consequence of FQ treatment, acquisition of FQRS in the nasal microbiota is frequent in the community and almost inevitable in hospitals. Acquisition from extranasal sites prevails. A restriction in species diversity in favour of more pathogenic and resistant species occurs. This highlights the major impact of FQ treatment on nasal microbiota, the role of the ecological environment in the emergence of FQRS, and the high-risk of dissemination of resistant staphylococci.
