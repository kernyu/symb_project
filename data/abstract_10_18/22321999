Antimicrobial susceptibilities and genotypes of Neisseria gonorrhoeae collected in 2006-2010 from 6 medical centers located in Italy were compared with those from a previous survey conducted in 2003-2005. Resistance to ciprofloxacin increased from 34.2% to 62% whereas penicillin resistance declined from 25.5% to 14%. Important change in antimicrobial resistance rates and a high genetic variability among N. gonorrhoeae from Italy were observed.
