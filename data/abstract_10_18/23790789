BACKGROUND/AIM: The burn-injured patient has a major potential to develop an infection because the wound itself, surgical treatment, mechanical ventilation and blood transfusions may potentially lead to a secondary immunodeficiency syndrome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total number of 100 consecutive burn-injured patients with sepsis were treated in the Clinical Emergency Hospital of Plastic Surgery and Burns, Bucharest,between 2009 and 2011. Their clinical and bioumoral data were analyzed. RESULTS: Flame was the main cause of burn injuries in the present series (78%). The mean body surface area burn wound was 49.7%. Most of the patients (97%) experienced the first septic episode within two weeks after burn injury.Sepsis was mainly due to Gram-positive (58%) and Gramnegative(26%) bacteria. Staphylococcus aureus (32%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21%) were the most frequently encountered germs. The susceptibility for Gram-positive bacteria was the best for imipenem/cilastatin, followed byamikacin, ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin. For Gram-negative bacteria, the susceptibility decreased from ciprofloxacin to imipenem/ cilastatin, amikacin and gentamicin. Mortality rate was 9%. CONCLUSIONS: The extensive knowledge of physiopathology,clinics, epidemiology, bioumoral and microbiology features of the sepsis in burn-injured patients allows an early and precise diagnosis and an adequate and efficient treatment.All these elements have been associated with a significant improvement of the survival rates. Every patient with burn injured sepsis must be treated as a different entity in order to obtain the best results.
