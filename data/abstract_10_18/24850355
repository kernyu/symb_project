Whole-genome sequencing was used to compare longitudinal isolates of Staphylococcus aureus that developed resistance to oxacillin (MIC up to 16 mug/ml). The mecA gene was absent. A novel 5-bp TATCC frameshift insertion in a gene encoding an ABC transporter similar to that of the teichoic acid translocation ATP-binding protein TagH and a 3-bp GCT nonframeshift insertion in the pdhA pyruvate dehydrogenase gene were detected in the oxacillin-resistant isolates.
