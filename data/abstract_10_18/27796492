The conventional drugs used for the treatment of human visceral leishmaniasis have concerns about the toxicity and most importantly parasite resistance. To overcome these troubles, more efforts are made for the development of innovative therapeutic agents having effective antileishmanial activity and simultaneously stimulate adaptive immune system of host cells. Hence, search for new leishmanicidal from the natural origin like plants has shown its effectiveness for the treatment of this tropical disease. The aim of this study is to investigate and characterize the antileishmanial efficacy of Coccinia grandis (L.) Voigt leaf extract (Cg-Ex) with its immunomodulatory property against Leishmania donovani in an in vitro experimental model. Cg-Ex significantly reduces the intracellular L. donovani parasite load with IC50 value 193 +/- 0.78 microg/ml, but it has lower cytotoxicity on the murine RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line. Interestingly, Cg-Ex induces the generation of potent antimicrobials like reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide dose dependently in infected murine macrophages. Moreover, the increased production of Th1 cytokines (IL-12, TNF-alpha) with a concurrent decrease of Th2 cytokines (IL-10, TGF-beta) was also observed in Cg-Ex-treated infected host macrophages. Our results thus confirm that serine protease inhibitor(s)-rich Cg-Ex exhibits antileishmanial activity in vitro, and this was mediated through the modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. On the whole, the present findings first demonstrate the antileishmanial property of Cg-Ex targeting the Leishmania serine protease resulting protection of host cells with Th1 cytokine expression. Thus, these data indicate that C. grandis leaf extract (Cg-Ex) might be considered as a new lead for designing alternative and novel natural therapeutic against visceral leishmaniasis.
