Tazobactam was the most recent beta-lactamase inhibitor to be approved in 1993. Since the approval of piperacillin-tazobactam, the complexity of beta-lactamase-mediated resistance among Gram-negative bacilli has increased enormously. After more than 20 years since the first such combination, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, was approved, several new beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations have reached late-stage (phase II and beyond) clinical trials. These include ceftolozane-tazobactam (2:1, ratios of beta-lactam to beta-lactamase inhibitor in parentheses), ceftazidime-avibactam (4:1), ceftaroline-avibactam (1:1), and imipenem-cilastatin-MK-7655 (2:2:1 and 4:4:1). Avibactam and MK-7655 are diazabicyclooctane (DABCO) inhibitors and thus not beta-lactams themselves; they include class A carbapenemases and class C enzymes within their spectra of activity. Ceftolozane is an antipseudomonal cephalosporin, and tazobactam is used to protect it against extended spectrum beta-lactamases to which it is labile. Additional novel combinations are in preclinical development. This review will focus on the biochemistry, antimicrobial activity, pharmacodynamics, and clinical development of these novel combinations.
