BACKGROUND: Antibiotic stewardship is a key component in the effort to reduce healthcare-associated infections. AIM: To describe the implementation and analyse the impact of fluoroquinolone restriction on resistance in Enterobacteriaceae, focusing on urinary isolates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli, which were historically almost universally resistant to fluoroquinolones. METHODS: ESBL-producing E. coli hospital and community isolates, obtained between April 2009 and March 2012 from consecutive non-duplicate urine samples, were included in an interrupted time-series analysis based on a Poisson distribution model. Periods before and after fluoroquinolone restriction were compared. The trend in fluoroquinolone resistance in all urinary isolates of Enterobacteriaceae (N approximately 20,000 per year) and blood culture isolates of E. coli (N approximately 350) between 2009 and 2013 were also analysed. FINDINGS: A large decline in the percentage of ciprofloxacin-resistant ESBL-producing urinary E. coli isolates was observed in both hospital (risk ratio: 0.473; 95% confidence interval: 0.315-0.712) and community settings (0.098; 0.062-0.157). The decline was also marked in all urinary isolates of Enterobacteriaceae and E. coli isolates from blood cultures. CONCLUSION: We conclude that reducing fluoroquinolone usage to a level of </=2 defined daily doses per 100 occupied bed-days in hospital sufficiently removed selection pressure to allow resistant Enterobacteriaceae - specifically, the UK endemic strains of ESBL-producing E. coli - to revert back to fluoroquinolone susceptibility within a short span of four months. This was accompanied with a concomitant reduction in overall ESBL burden.
