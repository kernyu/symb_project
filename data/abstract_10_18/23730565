Avian salmonellosis is an important disease causing serious impediment to the development of poultry industry especially in developing countries of Asia and Africa. Since no "effective" immunoprophylactic measures are available for the disease till date, strict biosecurity is the only alternative to preclude the disease. For formulating the control measures, an understanding of the epidemiology of the disease, proper diagnosis and identification of the causative agent is quintessential. This report sheds light on three different outbreaks of salmonellosis in three different farms in Kerala (India) describing the disease diagnosis, antibiotic resistance and the suggested control measures. All the three isolates were revealed to be Salmonella gallinarum and were resistant to at least three of the antimicrobial agents tested.
