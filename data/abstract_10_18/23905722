This study examines the tissue engineering potential of type I collagen cross-linked in the presence of hydroxyapatite (HAp). Scaffolds were prepared by controlled freezing followed by lyophilization of composite mixtures of collagen and HAp in acetic acid, followed by cross-linking with 0.3% glutaraldehyde. Scaffolds of three ratios were prepared, corresponding to collagen/HAp ratios of 1:2, 1:4, and 1:6. The scaffolds were evaluated for their microstructure, chemical and physical properties, swelling behavior, mechanical strength, biodegradability hemocompatability, cytocompatibility, and histopathology following subcutaneous implantation in Sprague Dawley rats. The collagen/HAp matrices showed a smaller pore size of 10-40 mum compared to 50-100 mum for pure collagen scaffolds. Pure collagen showed a mechanical strength of 0.25 MPa, and the value almost doubled for cross-linked composites with collagen/HAp ratio 1:6. The improvement in mechanical strength corresponded to a decrease in swelling and enzymatic degradation (measured by resistance to collagenases). FTIR spectra results in conjunction with scanning electron micrographs showed that cross-linking in the presence of HAp did not significantly alter the structure of collagen. MTT assay and calcein AM staining revealed prominent and healthy growth of mesenchymal stem cells in both the pure collagen as well as collagen:HAp composites of ratio 1:2. In vivo implantation in Sprague Dawley rats showed an initial acute inflammatory response during days 3 and 7, followed by a chronic, macrophage-mediated inflammatory response on days 14 and 28. Overall, a cross-linked collagen/HAp composite scaffold of ratio 1:2 was identified as having potential for further development in tissue engineering.
