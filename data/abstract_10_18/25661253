BACKGROUND: Data on susceptibility to ceftobiprole and colistin, and the complete evolutionary trends of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of important carbapenem agents among important pathogens collected in intensive care units (ICUs) in Taiwan are lacking. METHODS: We surveyed the MIC distribution patterns of ceftobiprole and colistin and susceptibility profiles of some important pathogens collected from patients hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs) of major teaching hospitals throughout Taiwan in 2007. We also investigated the rates of nonsusceptibility to powerful carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem) among four important species of Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Proteus mirabilis) collected during the same period. MIC breakpoints recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute in 2014 were applied. RESULTS: Colistin showed excellent in vitro activity (susceptibility rate, 96%) against Acinetobacter baumannii isolates but moderate (73-77% susceptibility rate) activity against isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and E. cloacae. The ceftobiprole MIC90 value was 4 mug/mL for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and 16 mug/mL for P. aeruginosa. The phenotype of methicillin resistance did not markedly increase the MIC value of ceftobiprole among S. aureus isolates. Interestingly, the proportion of isolates that displayed nonsusceptibility to imipenem was significantly higher among P. mirabilis isolates than among isolates of the other three Enterobacteriaceae species, regardless of the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. CONCLUSION: Continuous monitoring of susceptibility profiles of ICU pathogens to important antibiotics is warranted to provide appropriate antimicrobial regimens against infections in the ICU.
