UNLABELLED: The long cultivation of field pea led to an enormous diversity which, however, seems to hold just little resistance against the ascochyta blight disease complex. The potential of below ground microbial symbiosis to prime the immune system of Pisum for an upcoming pathogen attack has hitherto received little attention. This study investigates the effect of beneficial microbes on the leaf proteome and metabolome as well as phenotype characteristics of plants in various symbiont interactions (mycorrhiza, rhizobia, co-inoculation, non-symbiotic) after infestation by Didymella pinodes. In healthy plants, mycorrhiza and rhizobia induced changes in RNA metabolism and protein synthesis. Furthermore, metal handling and ROS dampening was affected in all mycorrhiza treatments. The co-inoculation caused the synthesis of stress related proteins with concomitant adjustment of proteins involved in lipid biosynthesis. The plant's disease infection response included hormonal adjustment, ROS scavenging as well as synthesis of proteins related to secondary metabolism. The regulation of the TCA, amino acid and secondary metabolism including the pisatin pathway, was most pronounced in rhizobia associated plants which had the lowest infection rate and the slowest disease progression. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: A most comprehensive study of the Pisum sativum proteome and metabolome infection response to Didymella pinodes is provided. Several distinct patterns of microbial symbioses on the plant metabolism are presented for the first time. Upon D. pinodes infection, rhizobial symbiosis revealed induced systemic resistance e.g. by an enhanced level of proteins involved in pisatin biosynthesis.
