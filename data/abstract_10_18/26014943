Broth microdilution checkerboard techniques based on the methodology of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) were employed to study the triple antifungal combination of caspofungin, posaconazole, and terbinafine against 27 clinical isolates of Scopulariopsis and Microascus species. Synergy was observed for 26 isolates, whereas antagonism was observed for Scopulariopsis candida in this study.
