OBJECTIVE: The aim of the this study was the analysis of the resistance to antibiotics of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated in last years. METHODS: 328 S. pneumoniae strains, coming from blood, CSF tracheal aspirate (TA), or sputum, pleural fluid (PL) and other samples (ear and sinus fluid) isolated in 2006-2008, were analyzed at INCDMI "Cantacuzino", National Reference Center for Streptococcus pneumoniae. Strains were tested for susceptibility to by agar diution method (minimal inhibitory concentration-MIC) to the following antibiotics: penicillin (Pc), erythromycin (Em), cephalothin (Kf). cefuroxim (Cxm), cefotaxim (Ctx), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazol (Sxt), ofloxacin (Ojx), amoxicillin (Amx). tetracycline (Te), cloramphenicol (Cm), vancomycin (Va). RESULTS: The analysis of the results was done according to CLSI 2009. Pneumococci strains isolated from blood, CSF, TA or sputum and PL showed lower resistance level to antibiotics (38.8% Pc, 9.3% Cxm. 4.1% Ctx, 2.7% Amx. 24% Em, 2.4% Ofx, 68% Sxt) against those isolated from ear ans sinus fluid which revealed high levels of resistance (70% Pc, 11.2 % Cxm, 5.9 % Ctx, 3.4% Amx, 58.4 % Em. 3.8% Ofx, 73% Sxt). Strains resistant to penicillin, isolated from blood and CSF revealed the following aspects: 17% low level of resistance and 11 % high level of resistance. CONCLUSIONS. The most efficient antibiotics were Ctx, Amx and Oft. A continuous surveillance of pneumococci strains resistant to antibiotics is needed, as well as the use of an pneumococcal efficient vaccine.
