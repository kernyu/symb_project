BACKGROUND: There is still a paucity of data on hepatitis B virus (HBV) subgenotype prevalence in North China based on sequencing of large-size samples. In addition, whether HBV genotypes impact drug-resistance-associated and HBV e antigen (HBeAg)-loss-associated mutations in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is still under investigation. This study aimed to disclose clinical prevalence of HBV genotypes/subgenotypes in North China and the clinical implications of HBV genotype classification in respect to HBeAg loss and drug-resistant occurrence. METHODS: Sera were collected from 1301 nucleos(t)ide analog-experienced CHB patients. Viral DNA was extracted and used as template for HBV genome amplification by nested PCR. DNA sequencing was performed for the analysis of HBV genotypes/subgenotypes, drug-resistance-associated mutations in polymerase gene and HBeAg-loss-associated mutations in precore/basal core promoter (BCP) regions. RESULTS: HBV/B, HBV/C, and HBV/D were detected in 190 (14.6%), 1096 (84.2%), and 15 (1.2%) patients, respectively. HBV/B2 (182/190), HBV/C2 (1069/1096), and HBV/D1 (12/15) were predominant subgenotypes within individual genotypes. By contrast, C2 prevalence is relatively lower in Beijing area (77.2%) than in other north areas (84.9% - 87.4%). HBV/C-infected patients had an older age and a lower serum albumin level but similar HBV DNA and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels compared to HBV/B-infected patients. HBV/C infection had a higher incidence of lamivudine-resistant mutations rtM204I/V (44.9% vs. 30.2%, P < 0.01) and BCP mutations A1762T+G1764A (65.8% vs. 40.0%, P < 0.01) compared with HBV/B infection. CONCLUSIONS: C2 is the most prevalent HBV subgenotype followed by B2 in CHB patients in North China; and HBV genotype prevalence is influenced by immigrant population. HBV/C infection is likely to have longer disease duration and severer liver functional impairment and might be more susceptible to develop lamivudine resistance compared to HBV/B infection.
