We did a retrospective review of children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection hospitalized from March 2010 to March 2013. Mycoplasma-resistant M. pneumoniae constituted 70% of the total M. pneumoniae-associated community-acquired pneumonia. Doxycycline was significantly more effective than macrolide for treatment of Mycoplasma-resistant M. pneumoniae-associated community-acquired pneumonia in terms of achievement of rapid defervescence within 24 hours.
