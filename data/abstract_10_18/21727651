Saccharomyces species are emerging opportunistic fungal pathogens that can cause bloodstream infections in humans. These infections have often been associated with the ingestion of probiotics. Saccharomyces oesophagitis is a rare condition which has been described so far in only two publications. Here we report the case of a patient who was diagnosed with Saccharomyces oesophagitis. The clinical picture was indistinguishable from that of Candida oesophagitis. The Saccharomyces isolate was shown to be susceptible to fluconazole by both CLSI M27-A and disk diffusion methods. In contrast to cases of fungaemia, Saccharomyces oesophagitis does not seem to follow probiotic use. Due to the potential for antifungal resistance among emerging fungal pathogens, proper mycological identification at the species level is essential.
