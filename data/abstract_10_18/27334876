BACKGROUND: Since 2005, the Togo National Malaria Control Programme has recommended two different formulations of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) and artemether-lumefantrine (AL), for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria. Regular efficacy monitoring of these two combinations is conducted every 2 or 3 years. This paper reports the latest efficacy assessment results and the investigation of mutations in the k13 propeller domain. METHODS: The study was conducted in 2012-2013 on three sentinel sites of Togo (Lome, Sokode and Niamtougou). Children aged 6-59 months, who were symptomatically infected with Plasmodium falciparum, were treated with either AL (Coartem((R)), Novartis Pharma, Switzerland) or ASAQ (Co-Arsucam((R)), Sanofi Aventis, France). The WHO standard protocol for anti-malarial treatment evaluation was used. The primary end-point was 28-day adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR), corrected to exclude reinfection using polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) genotyping. RESULTS: A total of 523 children were included in the study. PCR-corrected ACPR was 96.3-100 % for ASAQ and 97-100 % for AL across the three study sites. Adverse events were negligible: 0-4.8 % across all sites, for both artemisinin-based combinations. Upon investigation of mutations in the k13 propeller domain, only 9 (1.8 %) mutations were reported, three in each site. All mutant parasites were cleared before day 3. All day 3 positive patients were infected with k13 wild type parasites. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of AL and ASAQ remains high in Togo, and both drugs are well tolerated. ASAQ and AL would be recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Togo.
