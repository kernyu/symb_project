This study reports on the emergence of OXA-48-like carbapenemases among isolates of Enterobacteriaceae in South Africa. In addition, the emergence during therapy of a colistin-resistant OXA-181-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate was documented following selective digestive tract decontamination with oral colistin, which is therefore strongly discouraged.
