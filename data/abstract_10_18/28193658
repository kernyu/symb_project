African animal trypanosomosis (AAT) is caused by the tsetse fly-transmitted protozoans Trypanosoma congolense and T. vivax and leads to huge agricultural losses throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Three drugs are available to treat nagana in cattle (diminazene diaceturate, homidium chloride, and isometamidium chloride). With increasing reports of drug-resistant populations, new molecules should be investigated as potential candidates to combat nagana. Dicationic compounds have been demonstrated to have excellent efficacy against different kinetoplastid parasites. This study therefore evaluated the activities of 37 diamidines, using in vitro and ex vivo drug sensitivity assays. The 50% inhibitory concentrations obtained ranged from 0.007 to 0.562 mug/ml for T. congolense and from 0.019 to 0.607 mug/ml for T. vivax On the basis of these promising results, 33 of these diamidines were further examined using in vivo mouse models of infection. Minimal curative doses of 1.25 mg/kg of body weight for both T. congolense- and T. vivax-infected mice were seen when the diamidines were administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) over 4 consecutive days. From these observations, 15 of these 33 diamidines were then further tested in vivo, using a single bolus dose for administration. The total cure of mice infected with T. congolense and T. vivax was seen with single i.p. doses of 5 and 2.5 mg/kg, respectively. This study identified a selection of diamidines which could be considered lead compounds for the treatment of nagana.
