Enterococcal implant-associated infections are difficult to treat because antibiotics generally lack activity against enterococcal biofilms. We investigated fosfomycin, rifampin, and their combinations against planktonic and adherent Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 19433) in vitro and in a foreign-body infection model. The MIC/MBClog values were 32/>512 mug/ml for fosfomycin, 4/>64 mug/ml for rifampin, 1/2 mug/ml for ampicillin, 2/>256 mug/ml for linezolid, 16/32 mug/ml for gentamicin, 1/>64 mug/ml for vancomycin, and 1/5 mug/ml for daptomycin. In time-kill studies, fosfomycin was bactericidal at 8x and 16x MIC, but regrowth of resistant strains occurred after 24 h. With the exception of gentamicin, no complete inhibition of growth-related heat production was observed with other antimicrobials on early (3 h) or mature (24 h) biofilms. In the animal model, fosfomycin alone or in combination with daptomycin reduced planktonic counts by approximately 4 log10 CFU/ml below the levels before treatment. Fosfomycin cleared planktonic bacteria from 74% of cage fluids (i.e., no growth in aspirated fluid) and eradicated biofilm bacteria from 43% of cages (i.e., no growth from removed cages). In combination with gentamicin, fosfomycin cleared 77% and cured 58% of cages; in combination with vancomycin, fosfomycin cleared 33% and cured 18% of cages; in combination with daptomycin, fosfomycin cleared 75% and cured 17% of cages. Rifampin showed no activity on planktonic or adherent E. faecalis, whereas in combination with daptomycin it cured 17% and with fosfomycin it cured 25% of cages. Emergence of fosfomycin resistance was not observed in vivo. In conclusion, fosfomycin showed activity against planktonic and adherent E. faecalis. Its role against enterococcal biofilms should be further investigated, especially in combination with rifampin and/or daptomycin treatment.
