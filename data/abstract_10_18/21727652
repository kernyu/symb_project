Considering the importance of the mechanisms involved in quinolone resistance, this study evaluate the presence of PMQR in 126 epidemic and not epidemic strains of Salmonella spp. It was noted that presence of PMQR, by itself, did not generate resistance to ciprofloxacin; but detection of qnr genes in Salmonella spp. and the identification of the qnrB19 variant in a strain of poultry origin alert for the indiscriminate use of quinolones in poultry production, that can result in a pressure for mutant selection of resistant strains with a clinical limitation use of FQs in the near future. And last but not least, is the need to continued study of resistance mechanisms and to monitor the microbial resistance profile of epidemiological strains.
