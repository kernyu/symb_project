BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is a highly lethal cancer due to early metastasis and resistance to current chemotherapeutic agents. Abnormal protein kinase B (AKT) activation is an important mechanism of chemoresistance to gemcitabine, the most widely used agent in pancreatic cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the study, we tested the hypothesis that combining an AKT inhibitor with gemcitabine would augment anti-tumor activity. We treated human pancreatic cancer MiaPaCa-2 cells with gemcitabine and the AKT inhibitor triciribine, alone and in combination, and evaluated treatment effects using trypan blue assay, 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay, and cell death enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay. Colorimetric data of MTT assay were computationally analyzed for synergism of the combination therapy by CalcuSyn2 (Biosoft, Great Shelford, Cambridge, UK). RESULTS: Both gemcitabine and triciribine inhibited cell growth in a dose-dependent manner. Triciribine synergistically enhanced the cytotoxic activity of gemcitabine. The combination index (CI) provides the synergistic, additive, or antagonistic effects of the two-drug combination. CI at the 50% effective dose at 1:500 ratio of gemcitabine to triciribine was 0.74, indicating the synergistic effect of the drugs. The combination treatment with the non-apoptotic dose of each agent distinctly induced apoptosis, with gemcitabine in combination with triciribine, synergistically inhibiting pancreatic cancer cell growth and inducing apoptosis. CONCLUSION: These findings support the use of triciribine to overcome activated AKT-mediated resistance of pancreatic cancer to gemcitabine.
