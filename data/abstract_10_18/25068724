The discovery of novel drug targets of a genome that can bind with high affinity to drug-like compounds is a significant challenge in drug development. Streptococcus gordonii initiates dental plaque formation and endocarditis by entering into the blood stream, usually after oral trauma. The prolonged use of antibiotics is raising a problem of multi-drug resistance and lack of an optimal therapeutic regime that necessitates the drug discovery of vital importance in curing various infections. To overcome this dilemma, the in silico approach paves the way for identification and qualitative characterization of promising drug targets for S. gordonii that encompass three phases of analyses. The present study deciphers drug target genomes of S. gordonii in which 93 proteins were identified as potential drug targets and 16 proteins were found to be involved in unique metabolic pathways. Highlighted information will convincingly render to facilitate selection of S. gordonii proteins for successful entry into drug design pipelines.
