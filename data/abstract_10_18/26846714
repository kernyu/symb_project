Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is a common Gramnegative bacterium and can cause serious infections, including hospitalacquired pneumonia, suppurative bacterial keratitis and acute burn wound infection. The pathogenesis of PA infections is closely associated with excessive inflammatory responses and bacterial virulence factors. Winglesstype MMTV integration site family, member 3A (Wnt3a), an upstream mediator in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, has been implicated as a regulator of inflammation. However, its role in PAinduced inflammation and bacterial clearance remains unknown. In the present study, the efficacy of Wnt3a conditioned media (Wnt3aCM) was assessed using western blotting and immunofluorescence, which showed that betacatenin, a downstream molecule of Wnt3a, was upregulated and translocated to the nucleus following exposure to 50% Wnt3aCM for 6 h. To explore the role of Wnt3a in PAinduced inflammation, the mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines and apoptosis in macrophages were measured using reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry, respectively. This indicated that Wnt3a suppressed inflammation by reducing the production of proinflammatory cytokines and by promoting apoptosis in macrophages. Furthermore, the mechanism of macrophagemediated bacterial killing was investigated, and the results indicated that Wnt3a enhanced macrophagemediated intracellular bacterial killing via the induction of the production of cathelicidinrelated antimicrobial peptide and betadefensins 1. Taken together, the current study explored the role of Wnt3a in inflammation and bacterial invasion, which may provide an improved understanding of host resistance to PA infection.
