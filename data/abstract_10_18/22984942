New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM-1) is a novel metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL). Sporadic cases of NDM-1 positive strains have been reported from different countries, suggesting a widespread dissemination. The aim of this study was the detection of MBLs in Enterobacteriaceae isolated from patients in Tehran hospitals. After identification tests, the susceptibility to the antibiotics was done by Kirby-Bauer method and broth microdilution. Carbapenem-resistant isolates were tested for carbapenemase production using the modified Hodge test (MHT). Carbapenem-resistant strains screened for bla(KPC) gene and genes encoding MBLs. Twenty-three isolates (6.3%) were resistant to meropenem, eleven isolates (3%) were resistant to ertapenem, and four isolates (1.1%) were resistant to imipenem. MHT was positive in 11 (47.8%) of the carbapenem-resistant isolates. In March 2011, we detected a multiple drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate that was resistant to all tested antibiotics except colistin. PCR confirmed that this isolate contained bla(NDM-1), bla(TEM), bla(SHV), and bla(CTX-M). This is the first report on the detection of MBL NDM-1 in Iran. The rapid spread of NDM-1-positive bacteria proved to be a major challenge for the treatment and control of infectious diseases.
