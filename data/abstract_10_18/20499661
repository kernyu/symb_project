Campylobacter is recognized as a major cause of human acute bacterial enteritis. The incidence of human Campylobacter infection has increased markedly in both developed and developing countries and, more significantly, so has rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant Campylobacter strains. It is caused by improper applying antibiotics in treating people and too frequent applying these substances in the animal husbandry. In this review, the patterns of emerging resistance to the antimicrobial agents useful in treatment of the disease are presented and the mechanisms of resistance to these drugs in Campylobacter spp. are discussed.
