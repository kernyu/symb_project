The experimental pharmacoenhancer cobicistat (COBI), a potent mechanism-based inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A enzymes, was found to inhibit the intestinal efflux transporters P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein. Consistent with its transporter inhibition, COBI significantly increased the absorptive flux of potential candidates for clinical coadministration, including the HIV protease inhibitors atazanavir and darunavir and the lymphoid cell- and tissue-targeted prodrug of the nucleotide analog tenofovir, GS-7340, through monolayers of Caco-2 cells in vitro.
