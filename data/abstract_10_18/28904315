Dry mouth occurs frequently in aged individuals, as well as in patients who are hospitalized, receiving multiple drugs, undergoing radiation treatment to the head and neck, or wearing a removable denture prosthesis, use of mouth rinse being often an option for relief. In the present study, we performed microbiological assessments of subjects given three different commercially available mouth rinses commonly employed in clinical practice (Peptisal, Biotene, ConCool) to determine their effects. For bacterial clearance in vitro, Peptisal showed the highest level of suppression of oral indigenous bacteria found in both planktonic formations and biofilm. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of these agents on biofilm formation on acrylic resin plates were examined using scanning electron microscopy. Again, Peptisal proved superior, because acquisition of resistance to antimicrobial peptides by a sensitive microbial strain was rarely observed. We conclude that Peptisal is an effective mouth rinse for clearance of planktonic and biofilm microorganisms present in the oral cavity.
