BACKGROUND: In many cancers, including AML, blacks have poorer overall survival. We investigated whether differences in post-remission therapy (PRT) were a contributing factor. METHODS: We compared PRT cycle number and intensity and time to PRT in blacks and whites, among 460 patients with newly diagnosed AML. RESULTS: Blacks and whites had PRT of equal cycle intensity and number, but black patients experienced a significant delay in starting PRT (2.73 months in blacks vs. 1 month in whites, p=0.047). Overall survival was equivalent in blacks and whites. CONCLUSION: PRT is delayed in blacks but does not explain differences in survival.
