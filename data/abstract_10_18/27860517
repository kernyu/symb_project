BACKGROUND: Ceftriaxone resistance in Salmonella is a serious public health threat. Ceftriaxone is commonly used to treat severe Salmonella infections, especially in children. Identifying the sources and drivers of ceftriaxone resistance among nontyphoidal Salmonella is crucial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) tracks antimicrobial resistance in foodborne and other enteric bacteria from humans, retail meats, and food animals. We examined NARMS data reported during 1996-2013 to characterize ceftriaxone-resistant Salmonella infections in humans. We used Spearman rank correlation to examine the relationships between the annual percentage of ceftriaxone resistance among Salmonella isolates from humans with isolates from retail meats and food animals. RESULTS: A total of 978 (2.9%) of 34,100 nontyphoidal Salmonella isolates from humans were resistant to ceftriaxone. Many (40%) ceftriaxone-resistant isolates were from children younger than 18 years. Most ceftriaxone-resistant isolates were one of three serotypes: Newport (40%), Typhimurium (26%), or Heidelberg (12%). All were resistant to other antimicrobials, and resistance varied by serotype. We found statistically significant correlations in ceftriaxone resistance between human and ground beef Newport isolates (r = 0.83), between human and cattle Typhimurium isolates (r = 0.57), between human and chicken Heidelberg isolates (r = 0.65), and between human and turkey Heidelberg isolates (r = 0.67). CONCLUSIONS: Ceftriaxone resistance among Salmonella Newport, Typhimurium, and Heidelberg isolates from humans strongly correlates with ceftriaxone resistance in isolates from ground beef, cattle, and poultry, respectively. These findings support other lines of evidence that food animals are important reservoirs of ceftriaxone-resistant Salmonella that cause human illness in the United States.
