The aim of this study was to determine whether hospitalisation of horses leads to increased antimicrobial resistance in equine faecal Escherichia coli isolates. E. coli were cultured from faecal samples of horses on admission and after 7 days of hospitalisation; antimicrobial susceptibility was determined for eight antimicrobial agents. Resistance profiles of E. coli isolates were grouped into clusters, which were analysed to determine resistance patterns. Resistance to 7/8 antimicrobial agents and multi-drug resistance (MDR; resistance to >/=3 antimicrobial classes) were significantly higher after 7 days of hospitalisation. Forty-eight resistance profiles were identified; 15/48 were present on day 0 only, 16/48 on day 7 only and 17/48 at both times of sampling. There was a significant association between day 7 profiles and resistance detected to an increased number of antimicrobial agents. Hospitalisation of horses for 7 days resulted in alterations in equine faecal E. coli antimicrobial resistance profiles.
