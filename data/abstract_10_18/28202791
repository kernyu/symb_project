Breakpoints are used to predict whether an antifungal agent will be clinically effective against a particular fungal isolate. They are based on a combination of MIC values, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic values, and clinical outcome data. For many fungus-antifungal combinations, these data might never be available. For these combinations, epidemiological cutoff values (ECVs) provide a methodology for categorizing isolates as either wild type (WT) or non-WT. In this review, we define ECVs, explain how they are generated using the CLSI methodology in standard M57, and describe how they can be used in clinical practice.
