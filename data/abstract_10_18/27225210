The aim of this study was to assess the treatment potential of quinacrine and oxyclozanide against Microcotyle sebastis (Monogenea: Polyopisthocotylea) infection in cultured black rockfish Sebastes schlegeli. The oral administration of quinacrine led to a reduction in the mean abundance of M. sebastis infection in all quinacrine-treated groups, and the groups of fish administered quinacrine at 50, 100, and 200 mg kg(-1) for 3 consecutive days showed a parasite mean abundance that was 50 to 30% lower compared to that of the control group, suggesting that quinacrine has a therapeutic potential against M. sebastis. Although oxyclozanide showed a very high in vitro killing activity, in oral administration experiments, only the groups of fish administered 200 mg kg(-1) showed less than 50% mean abundance of M. sebastis compared to the control groups, suggesting that the absorption efficiency of orally administered oxyclozanide might be low in black rockfish and/or that M. sebastis might be less sensitive to orally ingested oxyclozanide. As praziquantel has been the sole therapeutic against M. sebastis infection in Korea for a long time, a broadening of available control measures is advisable in order to reduce the possible emergence of praziquantel-resistant M. sebastis. In our study, although quinacrine and oxyclozanide showed a therapeutic potential against M. sebastis, the treatment efficacy was not high enough to replace praziquantel. Thus, after investigations on the pathological effects and pharmacodynamics, use of quinacrine or oxyclozanide in combination with praziquantel may be considered as a way to prevent praziquantel resistance in M. sebastis.
