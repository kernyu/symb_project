In the present study, Vibrio parahaemolyticus 690 in phosphate buffered-saline containing 3% NaCl was subjected to sublethal stresses: heat shock at 42 degrees C for 15 min, acid adaptation at pH 5.0 for 30 min, or cold shock at 20 degrees C for 4 h. The effect of sublethal stress on the susceptibility of V. parahaemolyticus to a chlorine-containing disinfectant (Clidox-S) and a quaternary ammonium compound (Quatricide) at 25 and 40 degrees C was investigated. It was found that the sublethal stresses examined enhanced the resistance of V. parahaemolyticus 690 to both disinfectants. Depending on the kinds of sublethal stress, V. parahaemolyticus 690 showed various degrees of enhanced resistance to disinfectants. Furthermore, the phenomenon of enhanced resistance to the disinfectants was more marked at 40 than at 25 degrees C.
