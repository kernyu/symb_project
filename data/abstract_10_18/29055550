Bovine mastitis is still a central problem on dairy farms despite control programs, and Escherichia coli is a crucial pathogen during the development of bovine mastitis. The virulence genes, antimicrobial susceptibility, and mortality of mice infected with different E. coli isolates from bovine mastitis were determined in this study. According to the presence of the specific genes chuA, yjaA, and TspE4.C2, these isolates mainly belonged to 2 different groups: group A (47/79) and group B1 (22/79). The ompC gene was detected in all the isolates, followed by fimH (89.9%), ECs3703 (88.6%), and ompF (73.4%), whereas most of the virulence genes were not detected in these isolates. The results of the antimicrobial susceptibility tests indicated that the isolates were susceptible to the fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides. An inverse relationship was shown between the expression level of ompF and antimicrobial resistance; additionally, the isolates that were nonsusceptible to at least 4 classes of antimicrobial agents showed a lower mortality to mice in comparison with the susceptible isolates. This study indicated that antibiotic resistance had emerged in E. coli from bovine mastitis in this area, and appropriate measures should be taken to avoid potential threats to humans and other animals.
