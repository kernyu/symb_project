BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistant Salmonella strains are a direct threat to human health when this resistance interferes with treatment and an indirect threat when resistance can be transferred to other human pathogens. The objective of the present study was to characterize antimicrobial resistant non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) isolates recovered from poultry industries, including a description of genetic diversity and virulence profiles. RESULTS: In total of 93 Salmonella isolates shown antimicrobial resistance to one or more drugs, all isolates exhibited common resistance to streptomycin, nalidixic acid and cephalothin but no ciprofloxacin resistance. Among 26 virulence gene profiling, 12 virulence genes, invA, orgA, prgH, sopB, tolC, sipB, gatC, msgA, pagC, spiA, sifA, and sitC were found in all antimicrobial-resistant NTS isolates. In comparing the data from ERIC-PCR clusters, virulence profiles and resistance profiles, some Salmonella isolates grouped into the same cluster were found to exhibit similar virulence and resistance patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Virulence profiling combined with ERIC-PCR offered a rapid approach to characterize antimicrobial-resistant NTS.
