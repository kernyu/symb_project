One of the key features of tumor cells is the acquisition of resistance to apoptosis. Thus, novel therapeutic strategies that circumvent apoptotic resistance and result in tumor elimination are needed. One strategy to induce apoptosis is to activate death receptor signaling pathways. In the tumor microenvironment, stimulation of Fas, Death receptor 4 (DR4) and tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) can initiate multiple signaling pathways driving either tumor promotion or elimination. Nitric oxide (NO) is an important signaling molecule now understood to play a dual role in cancer biology. More and more attention is directed toward the role displayed by S-nitrosylation, the incorporation of an NO moiety to a cysteine thiol group, in promoting cell death in tumor cells. Protein post-translation modification by S-nitrosylation has decisive roles in regulating signal-transduction pathways. In this review, we summarize several examples of protein modification by S-nitrosylation that regulate signaling pathways engaged by members of the TNF superfamily (Fas ligand (FasL), Tumor-necrosis-factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) and TNFalpha (TNFalpha)) and the way it influences cell fate decisions.
