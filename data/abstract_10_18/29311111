Despite the efficacy of biologics for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), many patients show inadequate responses and likely require neutralization of multiple mediators. Neutralization of both interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-17A with monoclonal antibodies showed greater efficacy than either agent alone in a mouse arthritis model with cooperative inhibition of key inflammatory factors, IL-6, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and CXC chemokine ligand (CXCL)1. Given the potential clinical benefit in RA, we generated a human dual variable domain antibody Ig, ABBV-615, capable of simultaneous binding and neutralization of IL-1beta and IL-17A. ABBV-615 was characterized and evaluated in cynomolgus monkeys for pharmacokinetics and toxicity to enable clinical development. ABBV-615 exhibited affinities (KD) of 12 and 3 pM on human IL-1beta and IL-17A, respectively, and potencies (IC50) of 3 and 58 pM, respectively, as well as excellent drug-like properties. ABBV-615 pharmacokinetics in cynomolgus monkeys was dose proportional from 20 to 100 mg/kg with a mean half-life of 16 days. However, a 13-week repeat-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys revealed time-dependent spontaneous infections exclusively in skin at all doses tested and not historically seen with single-agent anti-IL-1alpha/beta or anti-IL-17A. Consistent with reduced resistance to skin infections, IL-1beta- and IL-17A-stimulated human keratinocytes demonstrate cooperative or compensatory production of key antibacterial and inflammatory mediators such as lipocalin-2, G-CSF, CXCL1, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor, and IL-6, which aid in defense against skin bacterial infections. These results illustrate the skin-specific antimicrobial mechanisms of IL-1beta and IL-17A and highlight the importance of understanding unique combinatorial effects of biologic agents.
