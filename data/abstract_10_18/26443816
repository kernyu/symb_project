OBJECTIVES: Ceftaroline and ceftobiprole are new cephalosporins, which are active against MRSA by inhibiting PBP2a. Recently, high rates of resistance to ceftaroline were reported from Ghana. The objective of this study was to assess rates of resistance to ceftaroline and ceftobiprole in MRSA from Africa and to describe potential missense mutations of PBP2a. METHODS: MRSA isolates derived from Staphylococcus aureus colonization (n = 37) and infection (n = 23) and were collected in Cote d'Ivoire (n = 17), DR Congo (n = 6), Gabon (n = 21) and Nigeria (n = 16). The MICs were determined by the broth microdilution method. The mecA gene was sequenced and missense mutations were associated with the corresponding MLST ST. RESULTS: In total, 16.7% (n = 10) and 15% (n = 9) of isolates were resistant to ceftaroline and ceftobiprole, respectively. The corresponding MICs of ceftaroline and ceftobiprole correlated significantly (r = 0.92). Isolates belonging to ST241 harboured a triple mutation of PBP2a (N146K-N204K-G246E), which was associated with high rates of resistance to ceftaroline (90.9%) and ceftobiprole (81.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Resistances to ceftaroline and ceftobiprole were only detected in Nigeria and were associated with ST241 and a triple mutation of PBP2a.
