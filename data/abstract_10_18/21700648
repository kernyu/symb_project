Injuries to flexor tendons can lead to loss of finger function after healing due to adhesion formation. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of the new peptide, PXL01, in the prevention of peritendinous adhesions. The effect of a single intraoperative administration of PXL01 in sodium hyaluronate on mobility of the affected digit after surgery was assessed in a rabbit model by measuring total active motion, metatarsophalangeal-claw distance and resistance to bending the digits. Load-to-failure testing was done in the same specimens to assess tendon healing. The results demonstrated that a single application of PXL01 in sodium hyaluronate significantly improved mobility of the treated digits compared with the digits in which the same surgery was carried out but no treatment was provided. No negative effects on tendon healing were observed in connection with the treatment.
