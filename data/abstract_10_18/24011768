Here we report a case of a 55-year Caucasian man, who improved the metabolic profile after the treatment for Helicobacter pylori eradication. In particular, we report the changes in homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, fatty liver index and echographic liver pattern. We hypothesize the co-factorial role of H. pylori in the mechanisms involved in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease pathogenesis and insulin resistance, by the cytokine serum changes. If this correlation is confirmed, the H. pylori treatment may represent an option in the clinical management of liver steatosis.
