OBJECTIVE: To measure the frequency of antimicrobial resistance in pediatric blood culture isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. with focus on carbapenem resistance. METHODS: Over a period of three years, pediatric blood culture isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility, including molecular investigations for carbapenem resistance. RESULTS: Amikacin, carbapenems, colistin and tigecycline had an antimicrobial efficacy of >70% (n=140). 7 of the 15 randomly selected isolates were positive for carbapenemase gene; among them, five were New Delhi Metallo b-lactamase (NDM). CONCLUSION: There was a high prevalence of Klebsiella spp. in pediatric bacteremia and dissemination of NDM-mediated carbapenem resistance in pediatric wards.
