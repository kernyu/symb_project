Candida albicans, an opportunistic pathogen, has been known to form hypoxic biofilms on medical devices which in turn confers resistance towards antifungals, resulting in subsequent therapeutic failures. Inclusion of anti-biofilm agents in the control of infections is a topic of current interest in developing potential anti-infectives. The in vitro anti-fungal and anti-biofilm efficacy of 2,4-di-tert-butyl phenol [DTBP] was evaluated in this study, which revealed the potential fungicidal action of DTBP at higher concentrations where fluconazole failed to act completely. DTBP also inhibited the production of hemolysins, phospholipases and secreted aspartyl proteinase which are the crucial virulence factors required for the invasion of C. albicans. Various anti-biofilm assays and morphological observations revealed the efficacy of DTBP in both inhibiting and disrupting biofilms of C. albicans. Inhibition of hyphal development, a key process that aids in initial adhesion of C. albicans, was observed, and this could be a mechanism for the anti-biofilm activity of DTBP.
