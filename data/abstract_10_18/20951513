Antibiotic resistance in animal isolates of enterococci is of public health concern because of the risk of transfer of antibiotic resistance isolates or resistance determinants to consumers via the food chain. In this study, phenotypic and genotypic resistance in 192 pig isolates of enterococci to ampicillin, avilamycin, avoparcin, bacitracin, flavophospholipol, gentamicin, narasin, tetracycline, tiamulin, tylosin, vancomycin, virginiamycin, copper and zinc were investigated by susceptibility test and molecular methods. Resistance rates varied between the species but all isolates were susceptible to ampicillin, avilamycin, avoparcin, gentamicin and narasin but resistant to tetracycline and tylosin and intermediately resistant to copper. Only Enterococcus gallinarum and Enterococcus casseliflavus were resistant to vancomycin and virginiamycin resistance was present in less than half the Enterococcus faecium isolates. Zinc resistance was largely confined to Enterococcus faecalis but bacitracin resistance was uncommon in E. faecalis in comparison with the other species. Tiamulin resistance was common in all species except E. casseliflavus. Resistance to flavophospholipol was detected in most E. faecium isolates and in a high proportion of E. gallinarum, E. casseliflavus and E. hirae/durans but was only found in one isolate of E. faecalis. No tetO, rplC, rplD, vanA, vanB, vatA and vatD genes were found. The presence of ermB, tetL, tetM, tcrB, aac6-aph2, tetK, tetS, vanC1, vanC2, lsaA, lsaB and vatE varied between the species and largely corresponded to the susceptibility phenotype. The findings show that resistance to antibiotics of high clinical significance for nosocomial Enterococcus infections is absent, whereas antimicrobial resistance was detected for some other antibiotics including bacitracin, flavophospholipol, tetracycline, tiamulin, tylosin and virginiamycin.
