From February 2006 to January 2007, 150 chickens were collected from eight retail markets in Yaounde, and 90 (60%) tested positive for Salmonella. Seventy-nine chickens were contaminated with only one Salmonella serotype, 10 with two different serotypes, and 1 with four serotypes. The most prevalent serotypes were Enteritidis (47 strains) and Hadar (29 strains). The isolates were tested for their susceptibilities to amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, gentamicin, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, sulfonamides, nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethazole by disk diffusion assay. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, sulfonamides, and nalidixic acid were determined for the resistant strains by agar dilution method. Eleven isolates (10.7%) of the 103 tested were susceptible to all antimicrobials. Resistance was most observed to tetracycline (84.5%), streptomycin (44.7%), and nalidixic acid (34%). Forty-one isolates (39.8%) were multidrug resistant (resistant to three or more antimicrobials from different classes), of which 68.3% were Hadar and 21.9% Enteritidis. The most frequent resistant pattern in Hadar was streptomycin-tetracycline-nalidixic acid. These results highlight once more the need for surveillance of Salmonella contamination in poultry.
