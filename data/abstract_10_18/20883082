Candida tropicalis is one of the more common Candida causing human disease in tropical countries; the frequency of invasive disease varies by geography causing 3--66% of candidaemia. C. tropicalis is taxonomically close to C. albicans and shares many pathogenic traits. C. tropicalis is particularly virulent in neutropenic hosts commonly with hematogenous seeding to peripheral organs. For candidaemia and invasive candidiasis amphotericin B or an echinocandin are recommended as first-line treatment, with extended-spectrum triazoles acceptable alternatives. Primary fluconazole resistance is uncommon but may be induced on exposure. Physicians in regions where C. tropicalis is common need to be mindful of this lesser-described pathogen.
