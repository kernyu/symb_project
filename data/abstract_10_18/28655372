Recent changes in regulations by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services require long-term care facilities to meet specific requirements on antibiotic stewardship, promoting the appropriate use of antibiotics and antimicrobials. The goal is to improve patient outcomes and decrease the spread of infections caused by multi-drug-resistant organisms. Consultant pharmacists can help facility personnel implement policies and procedures for effective antibiotic stewardship, assist prescribers and facility staff in understanding how to use the facility's antibiogram, find appropriate resources, and provide facility personnel with feedback on their antimicrobial stewardship efforts.
