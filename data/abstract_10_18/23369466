Nursing homes are reservoirs for antimicrobial-resistant organisms (AROs). This study examined the time to environmental contamination with AROs in a new-build nursing home. Environmental sites in an occupied nursing home (N = 18) and a newly built replacement nursing home (N = 21) were monitored during an 11-week period before and after residents transferred between buildings. Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was detected during commissioning in the new building and was a frequent finding throughout the building after residents had moved in. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli O25b:ST131 was detected once.
