Detection of minor variant viral quasispecies of the rtV173L+rtL180M+rtM204V combination mutation in the hepatitis B virus (HBV) polymerase mediating both lamivudine resistance and vaccine escape is potentially important for tracking the development and evolution of resistance within both individuals and populations. A highly sensitive and specific assay to quantitate HBV genomes was developed with this mutation combination directly from viral DNA in serum using allele-specific quantitative PCR with locked nucleic acid primers and a minor groove binder probe. This combination of primers and probe yields a linear detection range down to 150 copies. This strategy has 100% specificity even in mixtures of predominately wild type genomes. The assay accurately detected 3x10(2) copies of the triple mutant spiked into 3 x 10(8) copies of the wild-type genomes (0.0001%), while maintaining 100% specificity. This approach was validated using serum from a subject infected with known lamivudine-resistant HBV. The triple mutant viral population was quantitated at 2.86 x 10(8) copies/ml within a total viral concentration of 1.03 x 10(1)(0) copies/ml of serum (2.8%). This quantitative allele-specific PCR strategy therefore is a useful method for highly sensitive and specific detection of point mutation combinations that are clinically important in the pathogenesis of drug resistance and/or immune escape.
