This study was conducted to explore the epidemiological and molecular differences between carbapenem-susceptible Acinetobacter baumannii (CSAB) and carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) isolates. Thirty-two CSAB and 55 CRAB isolates were collected in 2010. By multilocus sequence typing analysis, 31 (56%) CRAB isolates and 11 (34%) CSAB isolates belonged to ST2. Twenty-one (38%) CRAB isolates, and 4 (13%) CSAB isolates belonged to a new type, ST129. The blaIMP, blaVIM, and blaOXA-58-like were not detected in our study isolates. blaOXA-23 and blaOXA-24/40-like were not detected in all CSAB isolates. On the contrary, blaOXA-23 was detected in 51 (93%) CRAB isolates. Class 1 integron was detected in 19 (35%) CRAB isolates and 8 (25%) CSAB isolates (p>0.05). In conclusion, the ST2 and ST129 were the major sequence types in both CSAB and CRAB isolates. The blaOXA-23 is the primary carbapenem-resistance gene in CRAB isolates from hospitalized patients and the specimens collected from hospital environment.
