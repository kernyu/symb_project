Food-producing animals carrying extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-EC) have posed a potential threat to human and animal health. However, information regarding ESBL-EC in the intensive broiler breeding areas of Shandong Province, People's Republic of China, is very limited. The goal of our study was to investigate the prevalence and drug resistance characteristics of ESBL-EC in healthy broilers from Shandong Province. A total of 142 ESBL-EC isolates were collected from four prefectures in Shandong Province from October 2014 to February 2015. ESBL-EC isolates were frequently detected (142 of 160 samples, 88.8%) in healthy broilers. Antibiotic susceptibility testing showed that all 142 ESBL-EC isolates were resistant to ampicillin, piperacillin, and cefazolin but were sensitive to imipenem and meropenem. All ESBL-EC isolates carried one or more of the bla genes, in which blaCTX-M, blaTEM-1, and blaSHV-5 genes were identified in 142, 106, and 5 isolates, respectively. The blaCTX-M gene includes blaCTX-M-15 (56), blaCTX-M-65 (42), blaCTX-M-55 (36), blaCTX-M-14 (21), blaCTX-M-79 (1), blaCTX-M-3 (1), blaCTX-M-123 (1), and blaCTX-M-132 (1). In addition, 17 ESBL-EC isolates cocarried the genes of the CTX-M-1 and CTX-M-9 groups. Our findings indicate that healthy broiler flocks in Shandong Province in China are an important reservoir for ESBL-EC, with blaCTX-M and blaTEM-1 being the prevalent resistance genes identified.
