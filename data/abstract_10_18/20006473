New antimicrobials are needed to combat drug resistance and have often been equated with the identification and exploitation of novel targets. This study focused on the synthesis of new benzimidazole analogues with improved DNA minor groove-binding affinity and having lower cytotoxicity to mammalian cells as well as selective targeting of bacterial DNA over host DNA. 5-(4-Methylpiperazin-1-yl)-2-[2'-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-5'-benzimidazolyl]benzimid azole (DMA) cleared bacterial infections from mammalian cell culture without apparent cytotoxicity to mammalian cells. Moreover, DMA inhibited microbial topoisomerase over mammalian topoisomerase, with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) value for human topoisomerase I of >54microM compared with an IC50 of <10microM for Escherichia coli topoisomerase I in vitro.
