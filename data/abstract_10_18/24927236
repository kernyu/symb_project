BACKGROUND: The occurrence of clarithromycin resistance among Helicobacter pylori strains is a major cause of the treatment failure. Resistance to this drug is conferred by point mutations in 23S rRNA gene and the most prevalent mutations are A2143G and A2142G. The aim of the study was to evaluate the occurrence of A2143G and A2142G mutations in a group of H. pylori strains resistant to clarithromycin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 21 clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori strains collected between 2006 and 2009 in southern Poland. Resistance to clarithromycin was quantitatively tested with the E-test to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC value). The point mutations of H. pylori isolates were detected by PCR followed by RFLP analysis. RESULTS: The MIC values for clarithromycin for the analyzed strains ranged from 1.5 mg/L to 64 mg/L. Nine H. pylori strains exhibited A2143G mutation and A2142G mutation was found in 9 isolates as well. The results of RFLP analysis of 3 clarithromycin-resistant strains were negative for both mutations. The average MIC values for A2143G and A2142G mutants were 6 and 30 mg/L, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Frequencies of A2143G and A2142G mutations were the same in all isolates tested. Strains with A2143G mutation exhibited lower MIC values than A2142G mutants. Application of PCR-RFLP method for detection of clarithromycin resistance allows for better and more efficient management of H. pylori infections.
