BACKGROUND: Investigation of several outbreaks of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infection has demonstrated that contamination of the inanimate hospital environment could be implicated in the spread of these multidrug-resistant strains. AIM: To investigate the occurrence of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii on inanimate surfaces and possible dissemination in the hospital environment in Algeria as a potential source of infection in humans. METHODS: A. baumannii strains were isolated from the hospital environment and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using disc diffusion and E-test methods. Carbapenemase activity was detected using microbiological tests, including modified Hodge test, modified Carba NP test, and EDTA test. Carbapenem resistance determinants were studied by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. Clonal relatedness was determined using multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). RESULTS: A total of 67 A. baumannii isolates were obtained from 868 environmental samples and identified by MALDI-TOF MS. Among them, 61 isolates were resistant to imipenem with minimum inhibitory concentration >32 mug/mL and positive by the modified Hodge test and modified Carba NP test. In addition, the activity of carbapenemase was inhibited by EDTA in 32 strains. PCR and sequencing showed the presence of blaOXA-23 gene in 29 strains, and the blaNDM-1 gene in 32 isolates. MLST demonstrated the presence of five types of ST (ST19, ST2, ST85, ST98, and ST115). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated the dissemination of carbapenemase-producing A. baumannii strains recovered from inanimate surfaces in a hospital environment, surrounding patients, healthcare workers and visitors, in Algeria as a potential source for nosocomial infection.
