The 2', 5'-oligoadenylate synthetases (OAS) are antiviral proteins and several isoforms have been identified as flavivirus-resistance biomarkers in human and mouse. The expression kinetics and antiviral functions of porcine OAS family (OAS1, OAS2, and OASL) in PK-15 cells following infection by Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) were evaluated in the present study. The endogenous expression of the three OAS genes was efficiently induced by IFN-alpha treatment in PK-15 cells. However, expression of pOAS1 and pOAS2 responded more quickly than pOASL. Infection by JEV also induced the expression of the pOAS isoforms, but at a significantly lower level than that observed following IFN-alpha stimulation. Transient overexpression of pOASL and pOAS1 inhibited JEV replication more efficiently than OAS2 overexpression. Interestingly, knockdown of pOAS2 expression by siRNA treatment led to the highest increase in JEV multiplication. Co-silencing of RNase L and each pOAS revealed that the anti-JEV function of pOAS1 and pOAS2 were RNase L dependent, while the antiviral activity of pOASL was not. In conclusion, all pOAS isoforms play a significant role in the response to JEV infection, and are differentially induced by different stimuli. The alternative pathways of antiviral activity stimulated by OASL require further study.
