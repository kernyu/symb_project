Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O157:H7 was isolated from 30 (4%) of 744 cattle hide swab samples collected at Estonian slaughterhouses within a 3-year monitoring program of zoonotic pathogens. The isolates were characterized by determining the presence of STEC main virulence factors, the antimicrobial resistance profiles, and the genetic relatedness by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Thirteen strains carried the stx2 gene alone and 17 both the stx1 and stx2 genes. The most frequently detected stx subtype was stx2c, occurring alone (n = 12) or in combination with subtype stx1a (n = 13). All isolates harbored the intimin-coding eae gene and produced enterohemolysin. Twelve isolates (40%) showed resistance to at least one of the 14 antimicrobials and the isolates were predominantly resistant to streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, and ampicillin. No extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing isolates were detected. PFGE characterization of the isolates showed an overall similarity higher than 75%, and four clusters based on 100% similarity were revealed.
