INTRODUCTION: Tuberculosis (TB) is the number one infectious disease killer and exemplifies the most neglected of them. Drug-susceptible TB presents with high mortality especially in atypical forms, disproportionally affecting immunosuppressed and vulnerable populations. The drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) epidemic, a world crisis, is sustained and increased through person-to-person transmission in households and the community. TB diagnostics and treatment in recent years are highly evolving fields. New rapid molecular tests are changing the perspectives in diagnosis and resistance screening. Also, new drugs and shorter regimens for DR-TB are appearing. For the first time in recent history, a large number of randomized control trials are incoming. Areas covered: This article reviews most TB advances including new diagnostic tests, drugs, and regimens and outlines upcoming drug trials while disclosing the potential gaps the in development of patient-centered systems and current organizational challenges leading to a delay in the uptake of these innovations. Expert commentary: Innovations are occurring, but not many are implemented on a wide scale in developing countries. TB health systems and staff are not getting updated in parallel. More efforts and funds are needed not only to implement current novelties but also to research for future solutions to eliminate TB.
