Studies show there is an increasing rate of fungal infections, especially in immunocompromised patients and treatments for fungal genera, such as Aspergillus, Candida, and Cryptococcus, carry significant cytotoxicity with an increasing prevalence of antifungal resistance. We have previously reported a high-throughput assay for identifying peptoids with antimicrobial properties from combinatorial libraries. Here we report the application of this assay in identifying a peptoid with antifungal properties against Cryptococcus neoformans. Termed AEC5, this peptoid has comparable potency to existing clinical antifungal agents, excellent stability, and minimal cytotoxicity in mammalian cells.
