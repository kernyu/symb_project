Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) (resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampicin) will influence the future of global TB control. 88% of estimated MDR-TB cases occur in middle- or high-income countries, and 60% occur in Brazil, China, India, the Russian Federation and South Africa. The World Health Organization collects country data annually to monitor the response to MDR-TB. Notification, treatment enrolment and outcome data were summarised for 30 countries, accounting for >90% of the estimated MDR-TB cases among notified TB cases worldwide. In 2012, a median of 14% (interquartile range 6-50%) of estimated MDR-TB cases were notified in the 30 countries studied. In 15 of the 30 countries, the number of patients treated for MDR-TB in 2012 (71 681) was >50% higher than in 2011. Median treatment success was 53% (interquartile range 40-70%) in the 25 countries reporting data for 30 021 MDR-TB cases who started treatment in 2010. Although progress has been noted in the expansion of MDR-TB care, urgent efforts are required in order to provide wider access to diagnosis and treatment in most countries with the highest burden of MDR-TB.
