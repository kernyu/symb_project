Salmonella is a foodborne pathogen worldwide. Outbreaks of Salmonella are commonly associated with consumption of contaminated foods such as poultry products. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the occurrence, biofilm formation, antibiotic resistance, and sanitizer resistance of Salmonella enterica isolated from chicken carcasses. A total of 318 samples were collected from 15 chicken slaughterhouses in 8 provinces of Korea. They were then examined for Salmonella contamination. S. enterica isolates were tested for their susceptibilities to 15 antimicrobials by broth microdilution method. Their biofilm formation ability and resistance to sanitizers were also evaluated. Eighty-two isolates of S. enterica were obtained from the 318 samples. There were 14 serotypes and 2 untypable isolates. Fifty-seven (69.5%) isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic while 30 (36.6%) isolates were resistant to 5 or more antibiotics. Two S. Senftenberg and 3 S. Montevideo isolates exhibited considerable biofilm formation ability (A600 >0.2) following incubation in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth for 48 h. Biofilm cell survival and recovery growth assay after sanitization showed that most isolates were highly susceptible to 2.5% lactic acid and 0.1% cetylpyridinium chloride. Therefore, lactic acid and cetylpyridinium chloride might be alternatively or additionally used in addition to chlorine-based sanitizers that are frequently used to reduce Salmonella contamination of chicken carcasses. Our results provide basic information on the distribution of Salmonella serotypes in chicken slaughterhouses. This study also highlights the necessity to improve farming practices and use antimicrobial agents cautiously. This study also suggests that sanitization during the slaughtering process might be necessary to reduce Salmonella contamination of chicken carcasses.
