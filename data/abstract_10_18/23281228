BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are often treated with aminoglycoside (AG) antibiotics during infective pulmonary exacerbations. Achieving pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) targets to improve outcomes and counteract resistance is paramount. PURPOSE: The primary objective was to compare the number of pediatric CF patients achieving AG PK/PD targets when a clinical pharmacist (CP) managed therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) compared with usual care (UC). METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on the records of 40 CF patients that received AGs and >/=2 serum samples between 1/2007 and 5/2009. Chi-square and Student's t-test were used to analyze nominal and continuous variables, respectively. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients with 52 courses of AGs were included the CP group, and 22 patients with 42 courses were included the UC group. Ninety-eight percent of patients in the CP group reached AG PK/PD targets compared with 71% in the UC group, P < 0.001. Patients in the CP group reached the AG PK/PD target in a mean of 1.9 +/- 0.8 days compared with 4.8 +/- 3.4 days in the UC group, P < 0.0001. The average LOS in the CP group was 9 +/- 5 days compared with 12 +/- 7.5 days in the UC group, P = 0.033. The mean number of levels per patient was 2.7 in the CP group compared with 5.2 (range of 2-20) in the UC group, P < 0.001. Resource utilization associated with drug levels, dosing adjustments and LOS were $26,549, $14,069, and $1,680,000 in the CP group as compared with $40,683, $27,812, and $1,940,000, respectively, in the UC group. CONCLUSION: CP managed TDM resulted in a significantly higher percentage of pediatric CF patients achieving AG PK/PD targets 3 days sooner with an average LOS that was 3 days shorter. CP managed TDM resulted in significantly fewer dosage adjustments, drug levels, and cost associated with serum sampling, drug wastage, and LOS.
