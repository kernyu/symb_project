Enteric rods are the microorganisms most commonly isolated from blood of hospitalized patients. Bloodstream infections caused by them are associated with significant patient mortality. The aim of the study was analysis of clinical course and evaluation of clinical response on bloodstream infection caused by Escherichia coli. Microorganisms were evaluated for sensibility for antibacterial drugs. For that reason MIC (Minimal Inhibitory Concentration) of antibiotics from different groups was determined for E. coli strains isolated from patients with different clinical stage of infection. No significant differences were shown in sensitivity for antibiotics and MIC among the E. coli strains in correlation with clinical condition of studied patients.
