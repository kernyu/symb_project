We identified 5 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates showing high resistance to beta-lactams except imipenem and designated them ISMRK (imipenem-susceptible but meropenem-resistant Klebsiella). They carried the bla(IMP-6) and bla(CTX-M-2) on a self-transmissible plasmid. ISMRK may be falsely categorized as susceptible to carbapenems if imipenem is used to screen carbapenem resistance.
