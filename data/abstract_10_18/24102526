Herein, we report the design, syntheses and in vitro anti-microbial activity of two series of rhodanines with chalcone moiety. Anti-microbial tests showed that some of the synthesized compounds exhibited good inhibition (MIC = 1-8 microg/mL) against multi-drug-resistant Gram-positive organisms, including methicillin resistant and quinolone-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, in which the compound 4g was found to be the most potent with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 1 microg/mL against two methicillin-resistant S. aureus.
