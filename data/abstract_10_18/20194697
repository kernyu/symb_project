Combinations of voriconazole, fluconazole, and itraconazole with caspofungin were evaluated against 50 Candida glabrata isolates by the time-kill, disk diffusion, and Etest methods. The majority of antifungal combinations were indifferent. By the time-kill method, synergistic activity was detected with eight (16%) of the caspofungin-voriconazole and seven (14%) of the caspofungin-fluconazole combinations, but synergy was not seen with the caspofungin-itraconazole combination. Further comparisons of the Etest and disk diffusion synergy techniques with the time-kill method are warranted.
