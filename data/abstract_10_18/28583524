BACKGROUND: Data on drug-resistant cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in solid organ transplantation (SOT) are not often reported from resource-limited settings. We aimed to investigate the epidemiology and outcomes of this infection in SOT recipients at our institution. METHODS: This was a retrospective study conducted from January 2012 to May 2015. We included all SOT recipients who were suspected for drug-resistant CMV infection. Genotypic assay for UL97 gene mutation was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Patients were reviewed for demographic data, clinical presentation, virologic data, treatment, and outcomes. RESULTS: The population consisted of 18 (12 kidney, 6 liver) SOT recipients with a median age of 20 years (interquartile range [IQR], 1-49); 44% were male. Anti-CMV resistance testing was analyzed at a median time of 23 days (IQR, 14-33) after initiation of anti-CMV therapy with a median CMV load of log 3.79 copies/mL (IQR, 3.37-4.58). During a median period of 2 years (IQR, 1-3), 6 SOT recipients were identified with UL97 gene mutation in codon 460, conferring ganciclovir (GCV) resistance. Patients with UL97 gene mutation had a longer mean duration of CMV DNAemia compared with those without mutation (263 vs 107 days; P = .04). All patients received high-dose GCV. Two patients received foscarnet and cidofovir. Two patients died (non-CMV-related), and 4 patients developed opportunistic infections other than CMV. CONCLUSIONS: GCV-resistant CMV infection in SOT recipients is an emerging clinical problem in resource-limited country. Those with UL97 mutation CMV infection have prolonged duration of CMV DNAemia. Clinicians should be aware of this condition when caring for SOT recipients.
