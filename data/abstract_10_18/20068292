BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Prevention strategies are emerging with the use of catheter-lock solutions (CLS) to prevent catheter-related infections. We compared 3 CLS: heparin, citrate (46%) and heparin/gentamicin (H/G). DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Three periods of 6 months using the three CLS were compared. RESULTS: 265 catheters were studied. The CRI rate per 1,000 catheter-days was 2.9 for heparin, 3.4 for citrate and 0.4 for H/G. The free-infection catheter survival tended to be higher with H/G (log-rank test, p = 0.06) and the CRP had a significant decreasing course (p = 0.03). Since 2006 H/G was used as CLS in our dialysis unit. The resistance to gentamicin of Enterobacteriaceae increased in the nephrology department and in the entire hospital. On the other hand, the resistance of Staphylococcus aureus to gentamicin dropped to nil. CONCLUSION: CLS with heparin/gentamicin tended to decrease CRI compared to citrate 46% and heparin and frankly improved the CRP course after catheter insertion. Gentamicin resistance should be monitored.
