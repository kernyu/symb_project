A new Lycoris radiata pathogenesis-related (PR)-4 gene, LrPR4 was isolated. LrPR4 encodes a 142 amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 15.43 kDa and pI of 7.56. The putative LrPR4 shows high similarity to PR4 type proteins from various plant species and belongs to the Barwin family. Like other PR4s from monocot plants, LrPR4 protein contains a conserved Barwin domain and has a signal peptide at its N-terminus. The recombinant LrPR4 protein expressed in Escherichia coli showed activity towards hydrolysing RNA from L. radiata bulbs and antifungal activity. The results of this study suggest that LrPR4 may play a role in the disease resistance responses of plant against pathogen attacks though its antifungal activity.
