In this study, we focused on determining the distribution and prevalence of major plasmid replicons in beta-lactam-resistant Escherichia fergusonii and Enterobacteriaceae of animal and human origin. A high degree of plasmid variability and multiple plasmid replicons were observed among the isolates. The IncF and IncI1 replicons were the most prevalent in E. fergusonii and Salmonella enterica serovar Indiana isolated from swine and poultry in South Korea, respectively. The presence of broad-host-range plasmid replicons such as IncN, IncA/C, IncHI1, and IncHI2 that are associated with important virulence genes and toxins as well as antimicrobial resistance determinants indicates that E. fergusonii has the potential to become an important pig pathogen and possible emerging opportunistic zoonotic pathogen.
