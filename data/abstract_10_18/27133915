Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a critical factor involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Vitamin D and resveratrol are two nutritional factors that have reported neuroprotective effects, and findings from cellular models suggest that resveratrol could potentiate vitamin D's effects. We aimed to determine the effects of vitamin D & resveratrol on ER stress mediated neurodegeneration and whether synergistic effects existed. Tunicamycin and Abeta25-35 was utilized to induce ER stress in SH-SY5Y cells, cells were then incubated with vitamin D and resveratrol. The combination of vitamin D & resveratrol completely reversed tunicamycin and Abeta25-35 induced cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells, as well as elevation in ER stress markers (i.e.GRP78, p-eIF2alpha and CHOP), insulin signaling disruption (i.e. elevation in p-IRS-1serine307 and reduction in p-Akt serine473) and tau phosphorylation (i.e. reduction in p-GSK3beta serine9, and elevation in p-Tau serine396 &404). Further studies are required to clarify whether the observed synergistic effects in the present study would also existed in vivo, this will lay scientific foundation whether the combination of vitamin D with resveratrol might be an effective maneuver in the treatment of AD in human subjects.
