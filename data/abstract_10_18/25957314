In this work, we review progress made in understanding the molecular underpinnings of growth and division in mycobacteria, concentrating on work published since the last comprehensive review ( Hett and Rubin 2008). We have focused on exciting work making use of new time-lapse imaging technologies coupled with reporter-gene fusions and antimicrobial treatment to generate insights into how mycobacteria grow and divide in a heterogeneous manner. We try to reconcile the different observations reported, providing a model of how they might fit together. We also review the topic of mycobacterial spores, which has generated considerable discussion during the last few years. Resuscitation promoting factors, and regulation of growth and division, have also been actively researched, and we summarize progress in these areas.
