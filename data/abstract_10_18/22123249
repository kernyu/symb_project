Lateral gene transfer (LGT) is essential for generating between-strain genomic recombinants of Chlamydia trachomatis to facilitate the organism's evolution. Because there is no reliable laboratory-based gene transfer system for C. trachomatis, in vitro generation of recombinants from antibiotic-resistant strains is being used to study LGT. However, selection pressures imposed on in vitro recombinants likely affect statistical properties of recombination relative to naturally occurring clinical recombinants, including prevalence at particular loci. We examined multiple loci for 16 in vitro-derived recombinants of ofloxacin- and rifampin-resistant L(1) and D strains, respectively, grown with both antibiotics, and compared these with the same sequenced loci among 11 clinical recombinants. Breakpoints and recombination frequency were examined using phylogenetics, bioinformatics, and statistics. In vitro and clinical isolates clustered perfectly into two groups, without misclassification, using Ward's minimum variance based on breakpoint data. As expected, gyrA (confers ofloxacin resistance) and rpoB (confers rifampin resistance) had significantly more breakpoints among in vitro recombinants than among clinical recombinants (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.02, respectively, using the Wilcoxon rank sum test). Unexpectedly, trpA also had significantly more breakpoints for in vitro recombinants (P < 0.0001). There was also significant selection at other loci. The strongest bias was for ompA in strain D (P = 3.3 x 10(-8)). Our results indicate that the in vitro model differs statistically from natural recombination events. Additional genomic studies are needed to determine the factors responsible for the observed selection biases at unexpected loci and whether these are important for LGT to inform approaches for genetically manipulating C. trachomatis.
