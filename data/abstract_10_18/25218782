The widespread use of acyclovir (ACV) and the increasing number of immunocompromised patients have raised concern about an increase in ACV-resistant herpes simplex virus (HSV). ACV resistance has traditionally been a major concern for immunocompromised patients with a frequency reported between 2.5% and 10%. The aim of this study was to reassess the status of HSV resistance to ACV in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients over a ten year period, between 2002 and 2011. This was done by retrospectively following 1425 patients. In immunocompetent patients, prevalence of resistance did not exceed 0.5% during the study period; whereas in immunocompromised patients, a significant increase was observed, rising from 3.8% between 2002 and 2006 (7/182 patients) to 15.7% between 2007 and 2011 (28/178) (p=0.0001). This sharp rise in resistance may largely be represented by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients, in which the prevalence of ACV resistance rose similarly from 14.3% (4/28) between 2002 and 2006 to 46.5% (26/56) between 2007 and 2011 (p=0.005). No increase in ACV resistance was detected in association with other types of immune deficiencies. Genotypic characterization of HSV UL23 thymidine kinase and UL30 DNA polymerase genes revealed 11 and 7 previously unreported substitutions, respectively. These substitutions may be related to potential polymorphisms, drug resistance, or other mutations of unclear significance.
