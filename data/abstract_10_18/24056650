BACKGROUND: AmpC beta lactamases are cephalosporinases that confer resistance to a wide range of beta lactam drugs thereby causing serious therapeautic problem. As there are no CLSI guidelines for detection of AmpC mediated resistance in Gram negative clinical isolates and it may pose a problem due to misleading results, especially so in phenotypic tests. Although cefoxitin resistance is used as a screening test, it does not reliably indicate AmpC production. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We planned a study to determine the occurrence of AmpC beta lactamase in hospital and community, clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and simultaneously evaluate different phenotypic methods for detection of AmpC beta lactamases. RESULTS: It was observed that 82.76% isolates were ESBL positive and 59% were cefoxitin screen positive. Using phenotypic confirmatory tests the occurrence of Amp C beta lactamases was found to be 40% and 39% by inhibitor based method using boronic acid (IBM) and modified three dimensional test (M3D) respectively. CONCLUSION: Both the test showed concordant result. Co-production was observed in 84.62% isolates Screening of ESBL and Amp C can be done in routine clinical microbiology laboratory using aztreonam and IBM respectively as it is a simple, rapid and technically less demanding procedure which can be used in all clinical laboratories.
