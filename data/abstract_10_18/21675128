Antibiotics introduced about 60 years ago as miracle drugs are getting less effications. This is a result of the emergence and dynamic dissemination of resistance due to the clonal spread of resistant strains and horizontal gene transfer. This has decreased therapeutic options and has reached an alarming level, a threat to public health and patient care. The WHO and ECDC call for immediate action aimed at the introduction of rationale therapy, and the enhancement of microbiological diagnostics and infection control programs. Lack of action in this field may lead to a post antibiotic era.
