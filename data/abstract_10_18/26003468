In this study, 238 rectal screening swabs for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) were compared using chromID CARBA plates and the CDC reference method. Direct inoculation of chromID CARBA plates only identified 53% of CRE, whereas meropenem broth enrichment increased the positive agreement to 88% and identified additional cases of CRE. Additionally, the chromID CARBA method allowed for faster results and decreased the number of colonies further tested.
