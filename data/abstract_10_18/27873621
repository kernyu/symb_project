Infections caused by multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli are increasingly challenging to manage in hospitals and long term-care facilities worldwide. As the therapeutic options are limited, the International Society of Chemotherapy in collaboration with the Asia-Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Immunology organised a consensus conference as part of the 13th Asia-Pacific Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infection. A panel of international experts from Europe, the Americas and Asia were convened to discuss the issues of therapeutic options for the management of these difficult-to-treat pathogens.
