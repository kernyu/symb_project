There is little information about the effectiveness of ciprofloxacin in regions where ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli is prevalent. This study was conducted to evaluate whether ciprofloxacin is effective as the initial empirical antibiotic for treatment of uncomplicated acute pyelonephritis (APN) due to ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli. A total of 255 women with clinical diagnoses of uncomplicated APN due to E. coli were enrolled in the emergency department between March 2005 and December 2008. All enrolled patients were initially treated with ciprofloxacin. Patients were followed up 4 to 7 days after the start of therapy and 14 to 21 days after its completion. At the first follow-up visit, ciprofloxacin was changed to the appropriate antibiotic when necessary, depending on the antibiotic susceptibility results. Not only improvement of symptoms and signs but also microbiologic eradication was assessed at each visit. Fifteen percent (39/255) of the E. coli isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin. There was no statistically significant difference between the clinical cure rates of the ciprofloxacin-susceptible group and the ciprofloxacin-resistant group at the first follow-up (87.0% versus 76.9%, P = 0.135) or the second follow-up (98.6% versus 94.9%, P = 0.177). However, there was a lower microbiologic cure rate in the ciprofloxacin-resistant group than in the ciprofloxacin-susceptible group (92.4% versus 41.7%, P = 0.000) at the first follow-up visit. No complications occurred in the ciprofloxacin-resistant group during the follow-up period. Our findings indicate that ciprofloxacin is an appropriate choice for empirical therapy of uncomplicated APN and has no serious adverse outcomes, if it is tailored appropriately, even for women infected with ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli.
