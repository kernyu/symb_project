Antimicrobial resistance was evaluated for 12,582 strains of Salmonella isolated by public and private laboratories from commercial poultry carcasses and poultry products from different regions in Brazil between 2007 and 2011. These isolates were submitted unsolicited to the National Reference Laboratory for Bacterial Enteroinfections, Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for conclusive antigenic characterization. The prevalent Salmonella enterica serogroups were O:4 (B) (28.9%), O:9 (D1) (22.3%), O:21 (L) (15.9%), and O:7 (C1) (14.3%); the most prevalent serovars were Enteritidis, Minnesota, Typhimurium, Schwarzengrund, and Mbandaka. The antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of 1,234 strains indicated that 54.5% were resistant to up to eight antimicrobial drugs. Multidrug resistance (three or more classes) was observed in 16.4% of the strains, with 190 distinct patterns. The results showed increased resistance to ampicillin (12.4 to 18.9%), tetracycline ( approximately 15.2 to approximately 18.9%), and gentamicin (f7.0 to approximately 9.6%) during the study period. Decreased resistance to nitrofurans (61.9 to 9.2%), quinolones (44.4 to 15.5%), and folate inhibitors (11.7 to 7.2%) was observed. Resistance to third-generation cephalosporins was detected in 5.5% of the strains throughout the study period; resistance to fluoroquinolones has been observed in 0.3% of the strains since 2009. These findings highlight the importance of surveillance along the food chain for detection of altered patterns among foodborne zoonotic bacteria that are important to public health.
