Antimicrobial-resistant extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) impact both human and veterinary medicine. One ExPEC clonal group that has become increasingly multidrug-resistant is serotype O15:K52:H1. Accordingly, we sought O15:K52:H1 strains among fluoroquinolone-resistant (FQ(r)) E. coli clinical isolates from humans (n=582) and dogs (n=120) in Australia. The phylogenetic group D isolates (267/702; 38%) were screened for O15:K52:H1-specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in fumC and the O15 rfb variant. The 34 so-identified O15:K52:H1 isolates (33 human, 1 canine) underwent antimicrobial susceptibility profiling, virulence genotyping, and macrorestriction profiling. Although susceptibility profiles varied, the 34 isolates were closely related by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and exhibited typical O15:K52:H1-associated virulence profiles (complete pap operon, F16 papA allele, papG allele II, iha, fimH, sat, fyuA, iutA, kpsMII, ompT). The canine isolate closely resembled human isolates. Thus, O15:K52:H1 strains contribute to the FQ(r) ExPEC population in Australia and may potentially be transferred between humans and dogs.
