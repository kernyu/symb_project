Given the current magnitude of the problem of antimicrobial resistance, particularly in the hospital setting, getting new agents to patients at the right dose and schedule is incredibly important. In vitro systems such as the 1-compartment model and the hollow fiber infection model (HFIM) can provide valuable information that allows rational decisions to be made which will drive the best choices of dose and schedule. Studies identifying the dynamically-linked index (dose fractionation studies) and the size of the index to obtain a specific amount of bacterial kill can be performed in both systems. Studies to examine dosing regimens that will help suppress resistance emergence are best done in the HFIM.
