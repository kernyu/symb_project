Objective: To investigate the therapeutic effects of givinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI), on the development of chronic asthma with airway inflammation, airway remodeling and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). Methods: BALB/C mice were randomly divided into control group, asthma group, dexamethasone group and givinostat group (n=12 per group). AHR was assessed. Total cell numbers and differential counts, interleukin-4(IL-4), interleukin-5(IL-5) and interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were measured in the above 4 groups. The pathology of lung tissue was evaluated. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining and Western blot were used to detect alpha smooth muscle actin(alpha-SMA) and transforming growth factor-beta1(TGFbeta1). Results: Compared with the asthma only group, givinostat treatment relieved airway resistance (2.96+/-1.01 vs 6.50+/-0.79, P<0.05). Total inflammatory cells [(33.04+/-5.62)x10(4)/ml vs (98.04+/-9.27)x10(4)/ml, P<0.01], eosinophil cells [(9.17+/-2.33)x10(4)/ml vs(37.64+/-6.98)x10(4)/ml, P<0.01], IL-4 [(10.12+/-2.98)ng/ml vs (16.88+/-2.78)ng/ml, P<0.05] and IL-5 [(27.09+/-3.62)ng/ml vs (37.86+/-7.34)ng/ml, P<0.05] levels were all reduced in givinostat group, while IFNgamma [(91.86+/-23.73)pg/ml vs (60.49+/-11.88)pg/ml, P>0.05] was enhanced in BALF. Inflammatory cell infiltration around the airway was reduced, with decreased inflammatory cell score[(1.60+/-0.69)points vs (3.40+/-0.68) points, P<0.01] and inflammatory cell number (111.65+/-31.41 vs 601.25+/-186.85, P<0.01). The goblet cell metaplasia [(26.36+/-2.33)% vs (57.21+/-11.56)%] and collagen deposition area [(52.77+/-7.58)mum(2)/mum vs (111.81+/-12.40)mum(2)/mum] were obviously reduced (P<0.01). The expressions of alpha-SMA and TGFbeta1 in the lung tissue were both significantly decreased (P<0.01). Conclusion: Givinostat treatment can reduce airway inflammation, airway remodeling and airway hyperresponsiveness in chronic asthma. Its effect is comparable to that of glucocorticoid hormone treatment.
