Copper (Cu) bactericides/fungicides are used extensively for crop protection in agriculture. Concerns for Cu accumulation in soil, Cu leaching into the surrounding ecosystem, and development of Cu resistance in phytopathogenic bacteria are evident. While there is no suitable alternative to Cu available to date for agricultural uses, it is possible to reduce Cu per application by supplementing with Zn and improving Cu bioavailability using nanotechnology. We have prepared a non-phytotoxic composite material consisting of generally recognized as safe ZnO 800 particles and nanocopper-loaded silica gel (ZnO-nCuSi). The morphology of the ZnO-nCuSi material was characterized using scanning electron microscopy, showing ZnO particles dispersed in the silica gel matrix. ZnO-nCuSi demonstrated strong in vitro antimicrobial properties against several model plant bacterial species. Two consecutive year field efficacy results showed that agri-grade ZnO-nCuSi was effective in controlling citrus canker disease at less than half the metallic rate of the commercial cuprous oxide/zinc oxide pesticide.
