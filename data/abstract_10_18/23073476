Pancreatic cancers relapse due to small but distinct population of cancer stem cells (CSCs) which are in turn regulated by miRNAs. The present study identifies a series of miRNAs which were either upregulated (e.g. miR-146) or downregulated (e.g. miRNA-205, miRNA-7) in gemcitabine resistant MIA PaCa-2 cancer cells and clinical metastatic pancreatic cancer tissues. Gemcitabine resistant MIA PaCa-2 cells possessed distinct ALDH-positive CSC fraction expressing stem cell markers OCT3/4 and CD44 and chemoresistance marker class IIIbeta-tubulin (TUBB3) which decreases on transfection with miR-205 resulting in the restoration of chemosensitivity to gemcitabine.
