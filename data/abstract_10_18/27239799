BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to develop a rapid detection method of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) strains both MALDI-TOF MS and flow cytometry (FCM). METHODS: A total of 174 K. pneumoniae strains were included in this study. Molecular characterization of carbapenemase gene was performed by PCR. Bacterial identification was performed by MALDI-TOF-MS. Meropenem susceptibility was tested at the concentrations of breakpoints described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guide by FCM. RESULTS: Sixty-two CRKP were positive for at least one carbapenemase gene. A total of 174 K. pneumoniae isolates obtained from clinically relevant material were correctly identified by Bruker MALDI-TOF MS with log (score) >2.0. These results were 100% concordant with the Phoenix() Automated Microbiology System (BD, MD) and conventional identification results. Based on the analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, the best validity and sensitivity data were obtained with a cut-off value of 18.88% by FCM. The concordance, sensitivity, and specificity for FCM by the selected cut-off values were 99.4%, 98.9%, and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that reliable results on bacterial identification and meropenem susceptibility test can be obtained within 2 hr combined by MALDI-TOF-MS and FCM.
