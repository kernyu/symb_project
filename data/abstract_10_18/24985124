UNLABELLED: The investigation and successful management of a monoclonal Acinetobacter baumannii outbreak in a neonatal intensive care unit are described. Upon the first clustered carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) infections, a bundle of actions were taken, including enhanced infection control, active surveillance (weekly stool samples), case-control study, staff education, daily audits and discontinuation of new admissions. Between September and December 2011, eight neonates developed 10 CRAB infections (five blood, four respiratory and one eye). A total of 216 active surveillance cultures were obtained from 96 neonates (43 % had >/=2 samples). During weeks 12, 16 and 17, active surveillance detected 3, 1 and 2 new CRAB acquisitions, respectively. Prevalence of infections/colonizations decreased, and no event occurred after 20th week. A colonized neonate developed CRAB sepsis and died. All CRAB isolates harboured bla OXA-58 and the intrinsic chromosomal bla OXA-51 carbapenemase genes. CONCLUSION: Active surveillance and enhanced infection control measures effectively contained spread of CRAB clone in the neonatal intensive care unit.
