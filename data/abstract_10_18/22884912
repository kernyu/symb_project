The anthelmintic sensitivity of two field-derived isolates (designated FI001 and FI004) of cattle nematodes from beef farms in Scotland were investigated in a controlled efficacy test (CET). Efficacies of ivermectin pour-on (IVM-PO), IVM injectable (IVM-INJ) and moxidectin pour-on (MOX-PO) formulations were assessed. In each group, five helminth-naive calves were infected experimentally with 50,000 third stage larvae from either isolate and administered with anthelmintic at the manufacturers' recommended dose rate 28 days later. For each isolate, nematode burdens were compared between treatment and control groups to determine efficacy. Nematode species composition, based on data derived from the untreated control groups' burden estimations, were 39 and 14% Cooperia oncophora and 61 and 86% Ostertagia ostertagi for isolates FI001 and FI004, respectively. Macrocyclic lactone resistance in C. oncophora was confirmed for both FI001 and FI004 isolates. Efficacies (as determined by nematode burden analysis) of 4, 21 and 31% for FI001, and 10, 1 and 74% for FI004, were obtained for IVM-INJ, IVM-PO and MOX-PO, respectively. Efficacy based on faecal egg count reduction at seven days post anthelmintic administration were 8, 99 and 100% for FI001, and 37, 20 and 100% for FI004 for IVM-INJ, IVM-PO and MOX-PO, respectively. In summary, this study details two macrocyclic lactone resistant isolates of C. oncophora obtained from cattle from two distinct geographical locales in the UK.
