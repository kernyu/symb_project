An oligopeptide permease family ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter encoded by SGR2418-SGR2414 was shown to be essential for aerial mycelium formation on glucose-containing media in Streptomyces griseus. In spite of only weak sequence similarity, the operon was equivalent to the bldK operon of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) in terms of chromosomal location and function. Transcription of the operon appeared not to be directly regulated by AdpA, a global regulator of morphological and physiological development in S. griseus, although it was affected by adpA inactivation. This study revealed that an ABC transporter was essential for aerial mycelium formation not only in S. coelicolor A3(2) but also in S. griseus, indicating that extracellular signaling by certain peptides should be conserved among different Streptomyces species.
