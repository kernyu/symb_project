Poland's first Enterobacteriaceae isolate producing the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM) was identified in August 2011. Escherichia coli sequence type ST410 NDM-1 was cultured from a critically ill patient who had been transferred directly from the Congo. The blaNDM-1 gene was carried by conjugative IncFII-type plasmid pMC-NDM (87,619 bp), which showed structural similarity to plasmid pGUE-NDM, which was identified earlier in France in an E. coli ST131 isolate of Indian origin.
