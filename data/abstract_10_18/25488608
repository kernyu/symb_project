There are few studies on the presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and AmpC beta-lactamases (ESBL/AmpC) in bacteria that contaminate vegetables. The role of the production environment in ESBL/AmpC gene transmission is poorly understood. The occurrence of ESBL/AmpC in Escherichia coli (n = 46) from lettuce and irrigation water and the role of irrigation water in the transmission of resistant E. coli were studied. The presence of ESBL/AmpC, genetic similarity and phylogeny were typed using genotypic and phenotypic techniques. The frequency of beta-lactamase gene transfer was studied in vitro. ESBLs/AmpC were detected in 35 isolates (76%). Fourteen isolates (30%) produced both ESBLs/AmpC. Prevalence was highest in E. coli from lettuce (90%). Twenty-two isolates (48%) were multi-resistant with between two and five ESBL/AmpC genes. The major ESBL determinant was the CTX-M type (34 isolates). DHA (33% of isolates) were the dominant AmpC beta lactamases. There was a high conjugation efficiency among the isolates, ranging from 3.5 x 10(-2) to 1 x 10(-2) +/- 1.4 x 10(-1) transconjugants per recipient. Water isolates showed a significantly higher conjugation frequency than those from lettuce. A high degree of genetic relatedness between E. coli from irrigation water and lettuce indicated possible common ancestry and pathway of transmission.
