In Germany, over half a million operations are done in dermatologic surgery in a hospital setting every year, as well as a less well quantified number of procedures in private offices. In spite of this large number, specific guidelines concerning the use of perioperative antibiotics in dermatologic surgery are sparse. In contrast to procedures in general, visceral or gynecological surgery, general guidelines on perioperative antibiotics issued by the Paul-Ehrlich Institutes and the AWMF do not specifically consider dermatologic operations. Several surveys indicate that familiarity with current recommendations on perioperative antibiotics is suboptimal and resulted in a considerable overuse of perioperative antibiotics in dermatologic surgery. Given the increasing antimicrobial resistance among important pathogens and the inherent risks of antibiotic administration, the decision for the use of prophylactic antibiotics should be based on the individual risk profile of the patient and of the surgical procedure. In the following, we will critically discuss the evidence for perioperative antibiotics in dermatologic surgery.
