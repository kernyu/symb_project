OBJECTIVE: To characterize carbapenem (CPM)-non-susceptible Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) and carbape-nemase produced by these strains isolated from Beijing Children's Hospital based on a five-year surveillance. METHODS: The Minimal Inhibition Concentration values for 15 antibiotics were assessed using the Phonix100 compact system. PCR amplification and DNA sequencing were used to detect genes encoding carbapenemases. WHONET 5.6 was finally used for resistance analysis. RESULTS: In total, 179 strains of CPM-non-susceptible K. pneumoniae were isolated from January, 2010 to December, 2014. The rates of non-susceptible to imipenem and meropenem were 95.0% and 95.6%, respectively. In the 179 strains, 95 (53.1%) strains carried the blaIMP gene, and IMP-4 and IMP-8 were detected in 92 (96.8%) and 3 (3.2%) IMP-producing isolates, respectively. 65 (36.3%) strains carried the blaNDM-1 gene. 6 (3.4%) strains carried the blaKPC gene, and KPC-2 were detected in 6 KPC-producing isolates. In addition, New Delhi-Metallo-1 (NDM-1) producing isolates increased from 7.1% to 63.0% in five years and IMP-4 producing isolates decreased from 75.0% to 28.3%. CONCLUSION: High frequencies of multiple resistances to antibiotics were observed in the CPM-non-susceptible K. pneumoniae strains isolated from Beijing Children's Hospital. The production of IMP-4 and NDM-1 metallo-beta-lactamases appears to be an important mechanism for CPM-non- susceptible in K. pneumoniae.
