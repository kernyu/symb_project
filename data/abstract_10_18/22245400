OBJECTIVES: Isolation rates of unusual non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli (i.e. other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii) are increasing but studies are limited to few observations. We aimed at determining risk factors for infection and influence of antibiotic treatment on the outcome. METHODS: A six-month (December 1, 2008-May 31, 2009) prospective multicenter cohort study was conducted in nine French teaching hospitals. Characteristics of patients colonized or infected by unusual NF-GNB, adequacy of antimicrobial therapies, and outcome were analyzed. RESULTS: Analysis of 158 patients (median age, 62.7 years) was conducted. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was the predominant bacterial species isolated (39%) followed by Achromobacter group (15%) and non-baumannii Acinetobacter species (13%). Compared to colonized patients, infected ones were more frequently immunocompromised [relative risk (RR) = 1.63, (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02-2.60, P = 0.05)], hospitalized within the last three months [RR 1.67 (95% CI 1.09-2.58, P = 0.02)], admitted in an intensive care unit with central venous catheter [RR 1.74 (95% CI 1.15-2.63, P = 0.01)]. The overall hospital mortality concerned 28 patients (18%) but no association with inadequate antimicrobial treatment was found except in the group of S. maltophilia infected cases [RR 2.81 (95% CI 1.01-7.83, P = 0.02)]. CONCLUSION: Naturally carbapenems-resistant S. maltophilia is the main unusual NF-GNB pathogen in hospitalized patients, leading to inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment at the time of emerging extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.
