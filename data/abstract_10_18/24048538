The performance of the Illumigene group A Streptococcus assay was evaluated by comparing it to culture using 437 consecutive throat swabs. The Illumigene assay was also directly compared to PCR with 161 samples. This Illumigene assay is rapid and easy to perform. The assay also has high sensitivity (100%) compared to culture or PCR and high specificity (99.2%) compared to PCR. A total of 8.8% of the isolates were erythromycin resistant, and 6.9% were clindamycin resistant.
