The polyketide metabolite 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (2,4-DAPG) plays a major role in the biological control of soil-borne plant diseases by Pseudomonas fluorescens 2P24. Two mutants (PM810 and PM820) with increased extracellular accumulation of 2,4-DAPG were isolated using transposon mutagenesis. The disrupted genes in these two mutants shared >80 % identity with the genes of the EmhR-EmhABC resistance-nodulation-division (RND) efflux system of P. fluorescens cLP6a. The deletion of emhA (PM802), emhB (PM803) or emhC (PM804) genes in strain 2P24 increased the extracellular accumulation of 2,4-DAPG, whereas the deletion of the emhR (PM801) gene decreased the biosynthesis of 2,4-DAPG. The promoter assay confirmed the elevated transcription of emhABC in the EmhR disrupted strain (PM801) and an indirect negative regulation of 2,4-DAPG biosynthetic locus transcription by the EmhABC efflux pump. Induction by exogenous 2,4-DAPG led to remarkable differences in transcription of chromosome-borne phlA : : lacZ fusion in PM901 and PM811 (emhA(-)) strains. Additionally, the EmhABC system in strain 2P24 was involved in the resistance to a group of toxic compounds, including ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, ethidium bromide and crystal violet. In conclusion, our results suggest that the EmhABC system is an important element that influences the production of antibiotic 2,4-DAPG and enhances resistance to toxic compounds in P. fluorescens 2P24.
