The introduction of highly potent direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) has revolutionized hepatitis C virus treatment. Nevertheless, viral eradication worldwide remains a challenge also in the era of DAA treatment, because of the high associated costs, high numbers of undiagnosed patients, high re-infection rates in some risk groups and suboptimal drug efficacies associated with host and viral factors as well as advanced stages of liver disease. A correct determination of the HCV genotype allows administration of the most appropriate antiviral regimen. Additionally, HCV genetic sequencing improves our understanding of resistance-associated variants, either naturally occurring before treatment, acquired by transmission at HCV infection, or emerging after virological failure. Because treatment response rates, and the prevalence and development of drug resistance variants differ for each DAA regimen and HCV genotype, this review summarizes treatment opportunities per HCV genotype, and focuses on viral genetic sequencing to guide clinical decision making. Although approval of the first pan-genotypic DAA-only regimen is expected soon, HCV genetic sequencing will remain important because when DAA therapies fail, genotyping and resistance testing to select a new active DAA combination will be essential.
