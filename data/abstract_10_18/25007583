The subcellular localization and the resistance to fungal pathogen Gibberella fujikuroi of the protein encoded by Arabidopsis AtELHYPRP2 (EARLI1-LIKE HYBRID PROLINE-RICH PROTEIN 2, AT4G12500) were investigated using transgenic tobacco plants. The coding sequence of AtELHYPRP2 was amplified from genomic DNA of Col-0 ecotype. After restriction digestion, the PCR fragment was ligated into pCAMBIA1302 to produce a fusion expression vector, pCAMBIA1302-AtELHYPRP2-GFP. Then the recombinant plasmid was introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404 and transgenic tobacco plants were regenerated and selected via leaf disc transformation method. RT-PCR and Western blotting analyses showed that AtELHYPRP2 expressed effectively in transgenic tobacco plants. Observation under laser confocal microscopy revealed that the green fluorescence of AtELHYPRP2-GFP fusion protein could overlap with the red fluorescence came from propidium iodide staining, indicating AtELHYPRP2 is localized to cell surface. Antimicrobial experiments exhibited that the constitutive expression of AtELHYPRP2 could enhance the resistance of tobacco to fungal pathogen G. fujikuroi and the infection sites could accumulate H2O2 obviously. The basal expression levels of PR1 and the systemic expression levels of PR1 and PR5 in transgenic tobacco plants were higher than that of the wild-type plants, suggesting AtELHYPRP2 may play a role in systemic acquired resistance.
