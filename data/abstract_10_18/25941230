The increasing incidence and severity of infection by Clostridium difficile have stimulated attempts to develop new antimicrobial therapies. We report here the relative abilities of two antibiotics (metronidazole and vancomycin) in current use for treating C. difficile infection and of a third antimicrobial, surotomycin, to kill C. difficile cells at various stages of development and to inhibit the production of the toxin proteins that are the major virulence factors. The results indicate that none of the drugs affects the viability of spores at 8x MIC or 80x MIC and that all of the drugs kill exponential-phase cells when provided at 8x MIC. In contrast, none of the drugs killed stationary-phase cells or inhibited toxin production when provided at 8x MIC and neither vancomycin nor metronidazole killed stationary-phase cells when provided at 80x MIC. Surotomycin, on the other hand, did kill stationary-phase cells when provided at 80x MIC but did so without inducing lysis.
