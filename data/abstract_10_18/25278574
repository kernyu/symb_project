Bacteria adapt to growth in lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) by selection of heterogeneously resistant variants that are not detected by conventional susceptibility testing but are selected for rapidly during antibacterial treatment. Therefore, total bacterial counts and antibiotic susceptibilities are misleading indicators of infection and are not helpful as guides for therapy decisions or efficacy endpoints. High drug concentrations delivered by aerosol may maximize efficacy, as decreased drug susceptibilities of the pathogens are compensated for by high target site concentrations. However, reductions of the bacterial load in sputum and improvements in lung function were within the same ranges following aerosolized and conventional therapies. Furthermore, the use of conventional pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) surrogates correlating pharmacokinetics in serum with clinical cure and presumed or proven eradication of the pathogen as a basis for PK/PD investigations in CF patients is irrelevant, as minimization of systemic exposure is one of the main objectives of aerosolized therapy; in addition, bacterial pathogens cannot be eradicated, and chronic infection cannot be cured. Consequently, conventional PK/PD surrogates are not applicable to CF patients. It is nonetheless obvious that systemic exposure of patients, with all its sequelae, is minimized and that the burden of oral treatment for CF patients suffering from chronic infections is reduced.
