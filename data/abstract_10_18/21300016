We investigated PfCRT 76T mutation in severe and non-severe malaria in Southern Mali. One hundred and ninety three severe malaria cases were each matched against two non-severe malaria cases. Patients with G6PD deficiency and any known hemoglobin abnormality were excluded. PfCRT 76T was present in 60.8% (n=386) non-severe malaria cases and in 77.2% (n=193) severe malaria cases (p<0.0001). In children 5 years or younger, these proportions were 62.9% (n=294) vs. 73.5% (n=147), respectively (p<0.01). PfCRT 76T was therefore associated with malaria severity in this setting of Mali.
