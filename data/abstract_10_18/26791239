Staphylococcus aureus resistance to antibiotics is a significant clinical problem worldwide. In this study, an untargeted lipidomics approach was used to compare the lipid fingerprints of S. aureus clinical isolates that are resistant and sensitive to antibiotics. High-performance liquid chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry was employed to rapidly and comprehensively analyze bacterial lipids. Chemometric and statistical analyses of the obtained lipid fingerprints revealed variations in several lipid groups between S. aureus strains resistant and sensitive to tested antibiotics including methicillin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, and fusidic acid. The levels of identified monoglycosyldiacylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, and diglycosyldiacylglycerol lipid groups were found to be upregulated in antibiotic-resistant S. aureus strains, whereas the levels of diacylglycerol lipid groups were downregulated. Differences in the lipid patterns between sensitive and resistant S. aureus strains suggest that antibiotic susceptibility may be associated with the lipid composition of bacterial cells. The lipids that were found to significantly differ between antibiotic-resistant and antibiotic-sensitive clinical isolates are involved in the biosynthesis of major S. aureus membrane lipids and lipoteichoic acid. This study indicates that S. aureus lipid biosynthesis pathways should be explored further to better understand the mechanism of antibiotic resistance in S. aureus strains.
