A recently discovered small-molecule inhibitor, BMS-488043 (BMS-488), for the invasion of Human immunodeficiency virus Type 1 (HIV-1), shows a high activity against the entry of diversified HIV-1. Docking and molecular dynamic studies have been carried out to understand the binding mode of BMS-488 to gp120 as well as the effect of the small molecule on the conformational change of gp120 induced by CD4 binding. The results indicate that BMS-488 can accommodate in the CD4 binding pocket and interfere the CD4 binding in a noncompetitive mode. The piperazine group of BMS-488 prevents the bridging sheet formation of gp120 induced by the CD4 binding mainly through blocking the rotation of the Trp112 located on the alpha1 helix of gp120. The bridging sheet formation cannot be blocked for the W112A mutant of gp120 due to the reduced steric hindrance, in agreement with its significant resistance to the BMS inhibitor. The aza-indole ring is likely to interfere the exposure of gp41 by stacking within the beta3-beta5 and LB loops to disrupt the close packing of Pro212-His66-Phe210. The mode of action of BMS-488 also accommodates many mutagenesis results related to BMS-488 activity.
