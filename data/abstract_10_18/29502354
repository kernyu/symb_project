AIMS: To investigate the potent control of microbial surface contamination of an innovative process which consists in incorporating metal oxide microspheres homogeneously into materials. METHODS AND RESULTS: Spherical microspheres containing zinc and magnesium oxides synthesized via a one-step manufacturing process (Pyrolyse Pulverisee((R)) ) and incorporated into different plastic matrices were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity according to JIS Z 2801 standard. A significant activity was observed for microsphere-added polyethylene coupons with a reduction of all tested bacteria populations including Gram negative and Gram positive even expressing acquired antibiotic resistance (Escherichia coli ESBL, Staphylococcus aureus metiR). An antiviral activity higher than 2 log of reduction was also observed on H1N1 and HSV-1 viruses. This antimicrobial effect was dose-dependent and time-dependent for both polyethylene and polypropylene matrices. Antimicrobial activity was maintained after exposition to disinfectants and totally preserved 50 months after the preparation of the coupons. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporated into plastic matrices, metal oxide microspheres showed significant antibacterial and antiviral activities. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
