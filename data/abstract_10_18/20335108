OBJECTIVE: To survey the prevalence of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and Laribacter hongkongensis (LH) and their drug resistance in diarrhea patients in Guangzhou. METHODS: We detected 646 fecal cases collected between Sep 2008 and Oct 2009 from the out-patient and emergency departments in a hospital. EC enriched culture medium was used for enrichment. MAC- and CMAC-specific culture media were used to isolate ETEC and LH from the specimens. The biochemical agents API20NE and API20E were employed for biochemical identification, and PCR was used for genetic identification. K-B disk diffusion method was used for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. RESULTS: No LH was detected in the total 646 patients, and 38 patients were positive for ETEC, with a detection rate of 6%. Antibiotics resistance test showed that 38 strains of ETEC had a high resistance rate to penicillin, tetracycline and sulfa, but remained sensitive to cephalosporins. CONCLUSIONS: LH may have a low prevalence in Guangzhou. The incidence of diarrhea caused by ETEC tends to decrease as compared with that a decade ago, and further multi-center survey is needed for confirmation. Consumption of aquatic products may be one of the major risk factors for ETEC infection. Cephalosporins can be used for ETEC-induced diarrhea.
