Since ten years pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin (PR) are a standard treatment for the patients with chronic HCV infection. Recently, new drugs emerge called direct-acting antivirals. The first of them, telaprevir (TVR) and boceprevir (BOC), which peptidomimetic NS3/4A HCV serine protease inhibitors, have been recorded this year in Europe. Adding them to the PR significantly increases efficacy of standard treatment and creates the possibility of its reduction. This paper presents, based on the results of the third phase studies, the efficacy of triple therapy in selected groups of patients. Also includes current recommendations for treatment with BOC or TVR in combination with PR.
