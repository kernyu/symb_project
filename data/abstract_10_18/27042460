INTRODUCTION: Resistance to antimicrobials has become a serious global health concern complicating treatment strategies and increasing health-care costs. The extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing bacteria stand out as bacteria of great epidemic concern among Gram negative bacilli. Control and appropriate interventions for antimicrobial resistance depend on effective surveillance and knowledge of the patterns and determinants of resistance. AIM: The present study was undertaken to detect and characterize ESBLs in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella Species from University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital, Maiduguri, North-Eastern Nigeria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Confirmed variants of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella Species isolated from 439 patients that were admitted in various units of University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital (UMTH) were screened for ESBL using CLSI breakpoints. Suspected ESBLs producers were subjected to confirmation using double disk synergy method. Detection of ESBL genes was further done by multiplex PCR. RESULTS: Out of the 439 isolates screened; the result shows 147 (33.5%) were ESBL producers but only 121(23.6%) were confirmed by the double disk synergy method. The prevalence of ESBL amongst the organisms were; 41/172 (23.8%) for Escherichia coli and 80/267/(30.0%) for Klebsiella Species. Based on PCR analysis, the various percentage genotypes of the ESBL producers were 44 (36.4%) for SHV gene followed by 38(31.4%) for TEM gene and the lowest of 33(27.3%) for CTX-M gene. CONCLUSION: ESBLs are prevalent among Species of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella Species in Maiduguri, Borno State, not only are there TEM and SHV but also CTX-M types. Antibiotic stewardship program to maximise use of available antibiotics is underscored as well as coordinated national efforts in combating resistance.
