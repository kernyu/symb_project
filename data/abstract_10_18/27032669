OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to characterize the in vitro and in vivo biological properties of a novel series of small-molecule bacterial type IIA topoisomerase inhibitors. METHODS: Bacterial susceptibility testing was performed by broth microdilution. Resistance frequencies were determined by plating bacteria onto agar containing test compound and enumerating mutants. Bacteria were passaged using subinhibitory concentrations of antibacterials to generate resistance. Target enzyme inhibition was determined by exposure to antibacterials and DNA; topoisomers were visualized by gel electrophoresis. Oral and intravenous pharmacokinetic profiles were determined in mice. In vivo efficacy was determined using a mouse model of septicaemia and thigh infection with MSSA and MRSA, respectively. RESULTS: Representative compounds REDX04139, REDX05604 and REDX05931 demonstrated in vitro potency against a range of Gram-positive and fastidious Gram-negative pathogens. Clinical isolate testing revealed REDX04139 and REDX05931 had MIC90 values of 0.25 and 0.5 mg/L, respectively, for MRSA and MIC90 values of 2 mg/L for streptococci. REDX04139 was bactericidal in vitro against Staphylococcus aureus at 8x MIC over 6 h. Pharmacokinetic profiling of REDX04139 and REDX05604 in mice revealed low clearance and excellent bioavailability (>/=71%). REDX04139 provided 100% survival against S. aureus in a mouse septicaemia model, while REDX05604 reduced bacterial load by up to 3.7 log units in the MRSA mouse thigh infection model. CONCLUSIONS: Redx Pharma has discovered a novel series of topoisomerase inhibitors that are being further developed for drug-resistant bacteria.
