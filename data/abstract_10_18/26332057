To survive in the periodontal pocket, Porphyromonas gingivalis, the main causative agent of periodontal disease, must overcome oxidative and nitric oxide (NO) stress. Previously, we reported that, in the presence of NO comparable to stress conditions, the transcriptome of P. gingivalis was differentially expressed, and genes belonging to the PG1178-81 cluster were significantly upregulated. To further evaluate their role(s) in NO stress resistance, these genes were inactivated by allelic exchange mutagenesis. Isogenic mutants P. gingivalis FLL460 (DeltaPG1181::ermF) and FLL461 (DeltaPG1178-81::ermF) were black-pigmented, with gingipain and hemolytic activities comparable to that of the wild-type strain. Whereas the recovery of these isogenic mutants from NO stress was comparable to the wild-type, there was increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide-induced stress. RNA-Seq analysis under conditions of NO stress showed that approximately 5 and 8% of the genome was modulated in P. gingivalis FLL460 and FLL461, respectively. The PG1178-81 gene cluster was shown to be part of the same transcriptional unit and is inducible in response to NO stress. In the presence of NO, PG1181, a putative transcriptional regulator, was shown to bind to its own promoter region and that of several other NO responsive genes including PG0214 an extracytoplasmic function sigma factor, PG0893 and PG1236. Taken together, the data suggest that PG1181 is a NO responsive transcriptional regulator that may play an important role in the NO stress resistance regulatory network in P. gingivalis.
