BACKGROUND: With the emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria reaching alarming levels and the year-long developmental void of new antimicrobial drugs, the rational and appropriate use of antibiotics is of paramount importance. The number of surgical interventions is still increasing so that surgical site infections represent the most frequent form of nosocomial infection. METHOD: Fundamental hygiene measures as well as aseptic and tissue-preserving surgical techniques are supported by perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent surgical site infections. This is accomplished by a single short-term antibiotic administration at the beginning of or at the latest during the operative intervention. Due to its contribution to the total consumption of antibiotics and when misused to the development of multidrug resistance, an appropriate and controlled perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis is mandatory. INDICATION: The indications for perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis depend on the type of surgical procedure, the classification of operative wounds as well as individual patient and operation-related risk factors.
