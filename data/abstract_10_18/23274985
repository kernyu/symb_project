Quorum sensing (QS) has been a novel target for the treatment of infectious diseases. Here structural analogs of Pseudomonas aeruginosa autoinducer N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) were investigated for QS inhibitor (QSI) activity and a novel QSI was discovered, N-decanoyl-L-homoserine benzyl ester (C2). Virulence assays showed that C2 down-regulated total protease and elastase activities, as well as the production of rhamnolipid, that are controlled by QS in P. aeruginosa wild-type strain PAO1 without affecting growth. C2 was also shown to inhibit swarming motility of PAO1. Using a microdilution checkerboard method, we identified synergistic interactions between C2 and several antibiotics, tobramycin, gentamycin, cefepime, and meropenem. Data from real-time RT-PCR suggested that C2 inhibited the expression of lasR (29.67%), lasI (21.57%), rhlR (28.20%), and rhlI (29.03%).
