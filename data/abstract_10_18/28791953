The effectiveness of carbapenems, considered as last-resort antimicrobials in severe infections, becomes compromised by bacterial resistance. The production of metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) is the most significant threat to carbapenems activity among Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The aim of this study was to assess the presence and type of MBLs genes in carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa clinical strains, to identify the location of MBLs genes and to determine genetic relatedness between MBL-producers using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The first identified MBL-positive (with blaVIM genes) P. aeruginosa strains were isolated from patients hospitalized in the University Clinical Hospital of Bialystok in the period from September 2012 to December 2013. Variants of MBLs genes and variable integron regions were characterized by PCR and sequencing. PFGE was performed after digesting of bacterial genomes by XbaI enzyme. By MLST seven housekeeping genes were analyzed for the determination of sequence type (ST). Three strains carried the blaVIM-2 gene and one harbored the blaVIM-4 gene. The blaVIM genes resided within class 1 integrons. PCR mapping of integrons revealed the presence of four different cassette arrays. Genetic relatedness analysis by PFGE classified VIM-positive strains into four unrelated pulsotypes (A-D). MLST demonstrated the presence of four (ST 111, ST27, and ST17) different sequence type including one previously undescribed new type of ST 2342. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that VIM-positive strains were resistant to carbapenems, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and quinolones, intermediate to aztreonam, and susceptible only to colistin. Integrons mapping, PFGE, and MLST results may point to different origin of these strains and independent introduction into hospitalized patients.
