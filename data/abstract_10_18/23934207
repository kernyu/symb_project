Community-associated (CA)-Staphylococcus aureus (CA-methicillin-resistant S. aureus in 57%) infections were reviewed in 179 infants (0-60 days) from June 2006 to June 2011. CA-MSSA accounted for 16 of 44 (36%) in year 1 up to 12 of 25 (48%) in year 5 (P = 0.08). Abscess/cellulitis infections were more likely (P = 0.006) to be caused by CA-methicillin-resistant S. aureus (67%) versus other manifestations of infections (46%). Among 160 isolates, 13% were clindamycin resistant and 63% were USA300.
