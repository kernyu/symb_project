UNLABELLED: We identified three nonpeptidic HIV-1 protease inhibitors (PIs), GRL-015, -085, and -097, containing tetrahydropyrano-tetrahydrofuran (Tp-THF) with a C-5 hydroxyl. The three compounds were potent against a wild-type laboratory HIV-1 strain (HIV-1(WT)), with 50% effective concentrations (EC50s) of 3.0 to 49 nM, and exhibited minimal cytotoxicity, with 50% cytotoxic concentrations (CC50) for GRL-015, -085, and -097 of 80, >100, and >100 muM, respectively. All the three compounds potently inhibited the replication of highly PI-resistant HIV-1 variants selected with each of the currently available PIs and recombinant clinical HIV-1 isolates obtained from patients harboring multidrug-resistant HIV-1 variants (HIVMDR). Importantly, darunavir (DRV) was >1,000 times less active against a highly DRV-resistant HIV-1 variant (HIV-1DRV(R) P51); the three compounds remained active against HIV-1DRV(R) P51 with only a 6.8- to 68-fold reduction. Moreover, the emergence of HIV-1 variants resistant to the three compounds was considerably delayed compared to the case of DRV. In particular, HIV-1 variants resistant to GRL-085 and -097 did not emerge even when two different highly DRV-resistant HIV-1 variants were used as a starting population. In the structural analyses, Tp-THF of GRL-015, -085, and -097 showed strong hydrogen bond interactions with the backbone atoms of active-site amino acid residues (Asp29 and Asp30) of HIV-1 protease. A strong hydrogen bonding formation between the hydroxyl moiety of Tp-THF and a carbonyl oxygen atom of Gly48 was newly identified. The present findings indicate that the three compounds warrant further study as possible therapeutic agents for treating individuals harboring wild-type HIV and/or HIVMDR. IMPORTANCE: Darunavir (DRV) inhibits the replication of most existing multidrug-resistant HIV-1 strains and has a high genetic barrier. However, the emergence of highly DRV-resistant HIV-1 strains (HIVDRV(R) ) has recently been observed in vivo and in vitro. Here, we identified three novel HIV-1 protease inhibitors (PIs) containing a tetrahydropyrano-tetrahydrofuran (Tp-THF) moiety with a C-5 hydroxyl (GRL-015, -085, and -097) which potently suppress the replication of HIVDRV(R) . Moreover, the emergence of HIV-1 strains resistant to the three compounds was considerably delayed compared to the case of DRV. The C-5 hydroxyl formed a strong hydrogen bonding interaction with the carbonyl oxygen atom of Gly48 of protease as examined in the structural analyses. Interestingly, a compound with Tp-THF lacking the hydroxyl moiety substantially decreased activity against HIVDRV(R) . The three novel compounds should be further developed as potential drugs for treating individuals harboring wild-type and multi-PI-resistant HIV variants as well as HIVDRV(R) .
