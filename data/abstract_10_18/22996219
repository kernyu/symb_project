The prevalence of ceftriaxone resistance and the associated genes encoding extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) was determined in 149 non-duplicate non-typhoidal Salmonella isolated in 2008-2009 from patients in a tertiary care hospital in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The resistance rate to ceftriaxone was 2.7% (2/74) in 2008, 4.0% (3/75) in 2009, and 3.4% (5/149) overall. CTX-M ESBL genes were detected in 2 of the 5 ceftriaxone-resistant isolates. The prevalence of ceftriaxone resistance, although low, is a concern because it limits therapeutic options. Continued surveillance of ceftriaxone resistance is important to monitor its trends.
