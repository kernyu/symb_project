OBJECTIVE: To compare the antimycobacterial activities of rifampicin (RFP) and rifabutin (RBT), and to evaluate the correlation between RBT resistance and genetic alterations in the rpoB gene. METHODS: The microplate-based alamar blue assay (MABA) method was performed to detect the antimycobacterial activities of RFP and RBT in 168 strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis). Meanwhile, we also analyzed the 81 bp core region of rpoB gene by DNA sequencing. The rate of gene mutations was analyzed by chi-square test. RESULTS: RBT was sensitive for all of the 66 RFP-sensitive strains with no mutations in 81 bp core region of rpoB gene. But of the 102 RFP-resistant strains, 76 strains were also resistant to RBT. Cross resistance between RFP and RBT was 74.5% (76/102). Alterations at codons 516, 526, 531 in the rpoB gene correlated with resistance to both RFP and RBT. While point mutations at codons 511 and 533 possibly influenced the susceptibility to RFP but not to RBT. The mutation rate (92.1%, 70/76) of rpoB gene of RBT-resistant strains was significantly higher than that (23.9%, 22/92) of RBT-sensitive strains (chi(2) = 78.12, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: RBT was more active against M. tuberculosis as compared to RFP. The RFP-resistant strains with MIC </= 4 mg/L were still susceptible to RBT. Our results suggest that analysis of genetic alterations in the rpoB gene is useful for predicting RFP-resistance, and may have implications for evaluating RBT-resistance.
