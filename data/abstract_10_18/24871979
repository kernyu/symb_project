Influenza virus infection causes thousands of deaths and millions of hospitalizations worldwide every year and the emergence of resistance to anti-influenza drugs has prompted scientists to seek new natural antiviral materials. In this study, we screened 13 different flavonoids from various flavonoid groups to identify the most potent antiviral flavonoid against human influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1). The 3-hydroxyl group flavonoids, including 3,2dihydroxyflavone (3,2DHF) and 3,4dihydroxyflavone (3,4DHF), showed potent anti-influenza activity. They inhibited viral neuraminidase activity and viral adsorption onto cells. To confirm the anti-influenza activity of these flavonoids, we used an in vivo mouse model. In mice infected with human influenza, oral administration of 3,4DHF significantly decreased virus titers and pathological changes in the lung and reduced body weight loss and death. Our data suggest that 3-hydroxyl group flavonoids, particularly 3,4DHF, have potent antiviral activity against human influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) in vitro and in vivo. Further clinical studies are needed to investigate the therapeutic and prophylactic potential of the 3-hydroxyl group flavonoids in treating influenza pandemics.
