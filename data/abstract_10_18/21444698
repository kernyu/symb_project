Each year, infections with the protozoan parasite Plasmodium falciparum kill 1 million people, mostly children in Africa. Intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) reduces the incidence of malaria and aims to prevent mortality in infants, children, and pregnant women. There is contradictory evidence as to whether this strategy may generate additional protection against reinfection beyond the limited duration of the intervention. Previous work established that ablation of either liver-stage maturation or subsequent life cycle conversion by causal prophylactic drugs elicits protective immune responses against reinfections when drugs are no longer present. Here we show in the rodent malaria model that pyrimethamine, a component of SP, inhibits liver-stage development in vitro and in vivo, confirming the causal prophylactic activity of pyrimethamine. Repeated exposure to high doses of Plasmodium berghei sporozoites during pyrimethamine prophylaxis induced complete protection in C57BL/6 mice against challenge with high doses of sporozoites delivered intravenously 35 to 199 days later. Immunizations by infectious mosquito bites induced limited, inoculation-dependent protection against subsequent challenge by infected mosquito bites but provided partial protection against experimental cerebral malaria. Short-term pyrimethamine prophylaxis during intravenous transmission of sporozoites from a pyrimethamine-resistant strain delayed, but did not prevent, blood-stage infection. Our data provide a rationale for the notion of sustained protective efficacy of IPT based on the capacity of arrested, drug-sensitive liver-stage and/or suppressed blood-stage parasites to mount lasting protection.
