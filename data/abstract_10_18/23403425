Prophylactic mupirocin for peritoneal catheter exit sites reduces exit site infection (ESI) risk but engenders antibiotic resistance. We present early interim safety analysis of an open-label randomized study comparing polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) and mupirocin. A total of 106 patients randomized to 53 in each group were followed up for a mean of 12.68 months per patient. On safety analysis, the PHMB group had a significantly greater ESI rate than the mupirocin group (odds ratio [OR], 0.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.09 to 0.80), leading to discontinuation of the trial.
