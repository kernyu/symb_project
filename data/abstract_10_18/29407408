Toxigenic and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and genetic relatedness of 42 non-O1/O139 V. cholerae strains, the majority of them isolated from seafood and marine water of the Adriatic sea, Italy, and 9 clinical strains, two of which with seawater of the Adriatic as the source of infection, were studied. All strains had hlyA El Tor gene but lacked ctxA gene. Four and two isolates, respectively, also had stn/sto and tcpA Class genes. More than 90% of strains showed susceptibility to cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, cloramphenicol, tetracycline, trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole and intermediate or full resistance to tetracycline and erythromycin. Six strains of seafood and clinical source were multi-drug resistant. PFGE analysis allowed to type all the strains with 50 banding patterns. Twenty-one strains, 11 and 8 from seafood and seawater, respectively, and 2 of clinical origin, were grouped into 9 different clusters. We report the presence of toxigenic and multidrug resistant non-O1/O139 V. cholerae strains in Adriatic, some of which genetically related, and support that they represent a potential reservoir of toxin and antibiotic resistance genes.
