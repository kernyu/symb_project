Difficulties in distinguishing species of the Elizabethkingia genus by MALDI-TOF prompted use of rpoB sequencing to investigate species distribution among 44 isolates from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Forty-three isolates from 38 patients formed a cluster comprising E. miricola and proposed novel species E. bruuniana sp. nov., the exception clustering with proposed species E. ursingii sp. nov., also part of this wider cluster. All 44 isolates were PCR-positive for urease gene ureG, whereas only one of 23 E. anophelis isolates from non-CF patients was positive, suggesting that this gene is largely associated with the E. miricola cluster. Antibiotic susceptibilities of 12 CF isolates revealed all were resistant to beta-lactams with the exception of piperacillin-tazobactam, and were only susceptible to minocycline and co-trimoxazole. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis revealed 4 shared strains among 17 CF patients in one pediatric clinic, but epidemiological investigations did not support patient-to-patient transmission except between one sibling pair.
