In dogs, Staphylococcus pseudintermedius is a common colonizer and is associated with pyoderma, otitis externa, and urinary tract infections. In the current study, nasal, pharyngeal, and rectal swabs were taken from 175 healthy dogs and cultured for S. pseudintermedius. The organism was found in 153 dogs (87.4%), including individuals in which it exclusively colonized in the nares (n = 1), pharynx (n = 16), and rectum (n = 17). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that a remarkably susceptible population, 46.4% of isolates, was susceptible to all drugs tested, and resistance to penicillin (39.9%) and tetracycline (23.5%) were most common. No methicillin (oxacillin)-resistant isolates were identified. Although 3.3% of isolates were erythromycin resistant, no inducible clindamycin resistance was found. The data provide a baseline for future resistance surveillance and indicate that multiple body sites, including at least the pharynx and rectum, should be tested.
