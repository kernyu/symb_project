Sickle cell anaemia (SCA) is a haemoglobin disorder that alters the deformability of erythrocytes through abnormal polymerization of haemoglobin. Children with SCA have an increased risk of infections with encapsulated bacteria. To guide the antibiotic prophylaxis and vaccinations in children with SCA in Gabon, we characterized Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae from children with and without SCA. We performed a cross-sectional study and compared nasal and pharyngeal S. pneumoniae, Staph. aureus and H. influenzae isolates from SCA children (n = 73) with comparators matched for age, residence and sex (n = 143) in a matched-comparison analysis. The resistance pattern and capsular type were identified for each isolate. The total carriage rate for S. pneumoniae, Staph. aureus and H. influenzae was 13.8%, 46.7% and 12.5%, respectively, and did not differ between groups (p >0.05). The mean number of days under antibiotic treatment in the past year was higher in children with SCA than in controls (penicillin: 70.1 vs 0.1 days, p 0.00002). The total non-susceptibility rate was 30% for oral and parenteral (meningitis) penicillin in S. pneumoniae, resistance rates were 1.6% for oxacillin in Staph. aureus and 14.8% for ampicillin in H. influenzae. Susceptibility to antibiotic agents and distribution of capsular types did not differ significantly between both groups. In conclusion, carriage and resistance rates are similar in children with and without SCA. Our data provide the basis to guide empiric therapy of invasive diseases caused by S. pneumoniae, Staph. aureus and H. influenza in children in Gabon.
