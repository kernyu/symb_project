Tellurite-based selective growth media are used for several bacterial pathogens. We found that, in Klebsiella pneumoniae, tellurite resistance is strongly associated with hypervirulent clonal group 23 (CG23), CG65, and CG86, providing a novel approach for screening environmental or carriage samples. The terW gene was also associated with these groups.
