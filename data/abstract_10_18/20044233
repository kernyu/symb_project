BACKGROUND: We explored the addition of rituximab to high-dose cytarabine (ara-C), oxaliplatin (L-OHP), and dexamethasone [R-DHAOx], in resistant and relapsed patients with CD20-positive follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. METHODS: Twenty-two patients were included; they were treated previously with one to five chemotherapy regimens, including 13 patients who had also received rituximab. R-DHAOx consisted of rituximab, 375mg/m(2), day 1; dexamethasone, 40mg/d, days one to four; L-OHP, 130mg/m(2), day 1; and ara-C, 2000mg/m(2) every 12 h, day 2. Courses were repeated every 21 days for eight courses. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (95%) achieved a complete response and one had a partial response. Responses were obtained in patients with and without resistance to prior treatment, either alone or combined with rituximab. The median follow-up time was 58.3 months (range, 8.7-92.6 months). Progression-free survival reached a plateau at 84% at 38.2 months. Only two of the 21 complete responders have relapsed. Tumor molecular markers disappeared in all 10 complete responders whose markers were found before treatment. Peripheral neuropathy related to the cumulative dose of L-OHP, and myelosuppression were the most prominent toxic effects. CONCLUSIONS: R-DHAOx is highly active for salvage treatment of patients with follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and it produces long-term antitumor efficacy.
