The aims of this study were to ascertain the presence and spread of class 1 integrons amongst environmental and clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and to characterise their variable regions. A total of 76 isolates (56 clinical and 20 environmental) were studied. The presence of plasmids was explored, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for integron detection. All amplicons were sequenced. PCR detected class 1 integrons in 26 of the 56 clinical isolates; environmental isolates were integron-free. No plasmids were found, thus all the integrons found are possibly on the chromosome. Most isolates presented one amplicon, except PA110514 and PA116136, which showed two PCR products each. Variable regions revealed that 18 strains carried only one gene involved in aminoglycoside resistance, whereas in 3 strains gene cassettes were not found. The most prevalent cassettes amongst isolates were those encoding aminoglycoside adenyltransferase B (aadB). Several of the strains had acquired the same or a highly similar cassette array as those detected in geographically distant P. aeruginosa. This finding suggests that contact with bacterial reservoirs contributes to the evolution of this pathogen towards multiresistance. Empty structures found may represent a reservoir increasing the capacity to adapt to the environment. However, these integrons are not retained when the selective pressure disappears. It is hypothesised that integrons containing gene cassettes are crucial vehicles for the rapid horizontal transfer of resistance. If this is so, reduced use of antibiotics may lead to a significant decrease in the carriage of integrons amongst P. aeruginosa strains.
