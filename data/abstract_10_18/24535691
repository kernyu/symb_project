Acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is common in immunocompromised patients, but the course of such infection is little known. We describe the long-term follow-up of HIV-infected patients diagnosed once with acyclovir-resistant HSV infections. We retrospectively studied all HIV-infected patients between 2000 and 2010 diagnosed with virologically confirmed acyclovir-resistant HSV infection. Patients' socio-demographic and immunovirological characteristics were described. Response to foscarnet or cidofovir and recurrences were reported. Among 5295 HIV-infected patients, 13 (0.2%) were once diagnosed with an acyclovir-resistant HSV infection. Twelve patients were men, nine patients were of African origin. All patients reported previous acyclovir exposure and median CD4 count was 183 cells/mm(3) Ten patients presented exclusively with cutaneous lesions. Initially, 11 patients were treated with foscarnet and two with cidofovir. The median follow-up was 67 months (6-145). All patients recurred, 10 presenting at least one acyclovir-resistant HSV recurrence. The median number of acyclovir-resistant HSV recurrences per patient was 2 (0 - 5). Regarding the first and second recurrences, 7/13 (54%) and 5/11 (45%) HSV clinical isolates exhibited resistance to acyclovir, respectively. Acyclovir-resistant HSV infection prevalence was low in our cohort. The rate of acyclovir-resistant HSV episodes averaged 50% during the two first recurrences.
