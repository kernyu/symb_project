The correct surveillance and control of infection caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) needs of update knowledge of its specific properties in each place. Our study aims to describe the current characteristics of infection due to MRSA in Extremadura. During 2010, 309 MRSA were collected from clinical samples in our region. A susceptibility test that included 17 antibiotics tested by AST -588 card Vitek 2 (R) and E -test method was performed on all isolates. A sample of 100 strains, selected by stratified random sampling, were genotyped by pulsed field electrophoresis (PFGE). The prevalence of MRSA in Extremadura was 20.2%. Don Benito-Villanueva area showed the most prevalence and a higher incidence. Merida reported the most favourable situation, with a relatively low ratios of prevalence and incidence. The community acquired reached 44 % in the region, showing predominantly in less populated areas (Navalmoral and Coria). The most common multiresistant pattern was tobramycin-levofloxacin-erythromycin (44%), followed tobramycin-erythromycin-clindamycin (20%). No linezolid, daptomycin and tigecycline resistant strains were observed, but 42 % of the MRSA strains showed decreased susceptibility vancomycin (DSV). PFGE analysis reported 27 genotypes, with 3 major genotypes: E8a (25%), E7b (17%) and E7a (12%). The post-hoc statistical analysis did not reveal significant differences in the distribution of genotypes between different areas. However it revealed some trends that should be considered.
