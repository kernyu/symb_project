We present a case of post-neurosurgical ventriculitis caused by carbapenemase-producing Enterobacter cloacae successfully treated with intraventricular colistin. Enterobacter spp are intrinsically resistant to aminopenicillins, cefazolin, and cefoxitin due to the production of constitutive chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamases. Moreover, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacter spp have been identified in the USA and Europe, and carbapenems are considered the drug of choice in these cases. Our isolate was sensitive only to fosfomycin, tigecycline, and colistin, and 6 days of intravenous colistin had failed to eradicate the infection. This case provides clinical evidence to support the administration of intraventricular colistin in such patients.
