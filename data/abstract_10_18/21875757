Physiologic and phenotypic alterations in the context of antibiotic resistance have been extensively studied in some bacteria. However there are not enough data addressing these alterations due to macrolide resistance in Campylobacter jejuni. The present study examined the fitness cost imposed by different macrolide resistance mutations and the phenotypic alterations due to exposure to macrolides in C. jejuni. C. jejuni was induced with different macrolide agents to obtain different macrolide resistance mutations. The results revealed that the mutations significantly imposed defect variations on the doubling time and the relative fitness in the resistant strains when competed against the susceptible strain. Furthermore macrolides through induction or exposure to sub-MIC concentrations impaired the motility of C. jejuni in 0.4% MH agar plates. Electron microscope analysis revealed the absence of flagellar filaments from strains exposed to macrolides. SDS-PAGE demonstrated that macrolides have no effect on protein synthesis and immunoblotting analysis further confirmed that flagellin was fully synthesized within C. jejuni strains exposed to macrolides. Nevertheless C. jejuni strains exposed to macrolides demonstrated defect in their excreted flagellin into the supernatant compared to strains not exposed to macrolides. Accordingly we speculated that macrolides inhibited flagellar filament formation in the strains exposed to macrolides via affecting the secretion of flagellin without affecting the amount synthesized within the bacteria. Taken together these findings demonstrated that different macrolide resistance mutations imposed different fitness costs and exposure to macrolides resulted in phenotypic alterations such as inhibition of flagellar filament formation and loss of motility in C. jejuni.
