BACKGROUND: Acute infectious diarrhea is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to characterize antimicrobial resistant diarrheagenic Escherichia coli strains isolated from diarrheic children in Tehran, IR Iran. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In total, 550 stool samples from diarrheic pediatric patients, aged less than 60 months, were collected and immediately transferred to the laboratory. Isolation and identification of E. coli strains was done using bacteriological methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the disk diffusion technique. Multiplex PCR was used to detect aadA1, tetA, tetB, dfrA1, qnr, aac (3)-IV, sul1, blaSHV, CITM, cat1, and cmlA antibiotic resistance genes. RESULTS: From the total of 550 fecal samples examined, 154 samples (28%) were positive for diarraheagenic E. coli. High rates of antibiotic resistance were seen against penicillin 100%), ampicillin 89.6% and tetracycline 83.1%. Resistance against ciprofloxacin was low 28.6%. The prevalence of different resistance genes in the studied strains varied from 96.10% for aadA1 gene to 40.25% for sul1 gene. The frequencies of aadA1, tetA, tetB, dfrA1, qnr, aac(3)-IV, sul1, blaSHV, CITM, cat1, and cmlA genes were 96.10%, 85.06%, 84.41%, 51.94%, 72.07%, 54.54%, 40.25%, 57.79%, 90.25%, 59.74% and 60.38%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that antibiotic resistance is increasing in diarraheagenic E. coli strains in Iran. It is imperative to develop strategies for prevention and control of resistant organisms. Changes in patterns of resistance against commonly used antibiotics in Iran indicate that an applied surveillance system and introduction of guidelines for appropriate antibiotic prescription are necessary.
