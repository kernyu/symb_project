This study investigated the effects of choline on intestinal mucosal immune and the possible mechanisms in fish by feeding juvenile Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var. Jian) with graded levels of dietary choline (165-1820 mg/kg diet) for 65 days. The results firstly showed that choline deficiency induced inflammatory infiltration in the proximal intestine (PI), mid intestine (MI) and distal intestine (DI) of fish. Meanwhile, compared with the optimal choline group, choline deficiency decreased the activities of lysozyme and acid phosphatase, contents of complement 3 and IgM in the intestine, downregulated the mRNA levels of antimicrobial peptides (liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide (LEAP) 2A and defensin-3 in the PI and MI, LEAP-2B and hepcidin in the PI, MI and DI), anti-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL) 10 and transforming growth factor beta2 in the PI, MI and DI), and signaling molecule IkappaB in the PI, MI and DI; while upregulated the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6a and tumor necrosis factor alpha in the MI and DI, interferon gamma2b in the PI and MI, IL-1beta and IL-6b in the PI, MI and DI), and signaling molecules (Toll-like receptor 4 in the MI, myeloid differentiation primary response 88 in the PI and MI, Janus kinase 3 and tyrosine kinase 2 in the MI and DI, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 4 and STAT5 in the PI, MI and DI) of juvenile Jian carp, further indicating that choline deficiency caused inflammation and immunity depression in the intestine of fish. But choline deficiency decreased the PI IL-6a mRNA level, and increased the DI LEAP-2A and defensin-3 mRNA levels with unknown reasons. Furthermore, dietary choline deficiency downregulated mRNA levels of tight junction (TJ) proteins (claudin 3c in the PI and MI, claudin 7, claudin 11 and occludin in the PI, MI and DI) and signaling molecule mitogen-activated protein kinases p38 in the PI, MI and DI of juvenile Jian carp, whereas upregulated the mRNA levels of claudin 3b in the MI and DI, and claudin 3c in the DI. Moreover, the excessive choline exhibited negative effects on intestinal immunity and TJ proteins that were similar to the choline deficiency. In summary, dietary choline deficiency or excess caused the depression of intestinal mucosal immune by inducing inflammation and dysfunction of the intestinal physical barrier, and regulating related signaling molecules of fish.
