Of 137 Staphylococcus lugdunensis isolates collected from two nephrology centers in Hong Kong, 10 (7.3%) and 3 (2.2%) isolates had high-level and low-level mupirocin resistance, respectively. Isolates with high-level resistance contained the plasmid-mediated ileS2 gene, while isolates with low-level resistance contained the mutation V588F within the chromosomal ileS gene. All but one of the ileS2-positive isolates belong to the predominating clone HKU1. Plasmids carrying the ileS2 gene were mosaic and also cocarry multiple other resistance determinants.
