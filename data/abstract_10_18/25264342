Aliskiren is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and is metabolized via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). The aim of the present study was to assess whether P-gp influenced the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren and also if drug-drug interactions (DDIs) mediated through P-gp could be reproduced in cynomolgus monkeys. The study investigated the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren in mdr1a/1b gene-deficient (P-gp KO) and wild-type (WT) mice. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) following the oral administration of aliskiren was 6.9-fold higher in P-gp KO mice than in WT mice, while no significant differences were observed in the AUC or total plasma clearance following the intravenous administration of aliskiren to P-gp KO mice. Then the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated and DDIs between aliskiren and P-gp inhibitors, such as cyclosporin A (CsA) and zosuquidar, examined in cynomolgus monkeys. The AUC for aliskiren were 8.3- and 42.1-fold higher after the oral administration of aliskiren with the concomitant oral administration of zosuquidar and CsA at doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg, respectively. In contrast, the AUC after the intravenous and oral administration of aliskiren was not significantly affected by the oral administration of zosuquidar or intravenous administration of CsA, respectively. These results indicated that P-gp strictly limited the intestinal absorption of aliskiren in mice and monkeys, and also that the effects of intestinal P-gp inhibition by CsA or zosuquidar on the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were sensitively reproduced in monkeys. In conclusion, aliskiren can be used as a sensitive substrate to evaluate intestinal P-gp inhibition in monkeys.
