Two erythromycin-resistant strains of Bordetella pertussis were isolated from nasopharyngeal specimens of two asymptomatic schoolchildren in China. High-resolution melting and sequencing analyses confirmed the homogeneous A2047G mutation in 23S rRNA genes of the two isolates. High-resolution melting (HRM) analysis is a useful assay for the rapid detection of erythromycin-resistant B. pertussis. The appearance of erythromycin-resistant B. pertussis strains in China is alarming.
