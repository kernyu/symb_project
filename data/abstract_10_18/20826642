In this study, the susceptibilities of 35 multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates to second-line drugs, including kanamycin (KM), rifabutin (RBU), ofloxacin (OFX), p-aminosalicylic acid (PAS), capreomycin (CAP), clofazimine (CFM), and ethionamide (ETH), were investigated on blood agar according to CLSI recommendations. Compared with the results of the Bactec 460 TB system, agreement was 100, 100, 97, 100, 100, 100, and 86% for KM, RBU, OFX, PAS, CAP, CFM, and ETH, respectively. Compared with the results of the proportion method, agreement was 100, 100, 97, 100, 97, 100, and 77% for KM, RBU, OFX, PAS, CAP, CFM, and ETH, respectively.
