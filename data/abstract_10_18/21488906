Flavobacterium columnare is divided into three genetic groups or genomovars, genomovar II being highly virulent for channel catfish. A modified live vaccine is currently available to prevent columnaris disease under the licensed name Aquavac-Col((R)) . The strain of F. columnare used to generate the avirulent rifampicin-resistant mutant used in Aquavac-Col((R)) belonged to genomovar I, the less virulent group towards channel catfish. In this study, we describe the generation and characterization of rifampicin-resistant mutants from genomovar II strains. A total of 13 new mutants were obtained, and eight of them (two from each parent strain) were genetically and phenotypically characterized. Highly conserved regions within the ribosomal operons were identical between parent and mutant strains. Genetic differences between mutants and their parent strains were revealed by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). Genetic changes were distinctive among different mutants. Analysis of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) showed that while some mutants lacked a few molecular bands of the LPS, some exhibited the same LPS profiles as their parent strains. Comparison between immunogenic proteins from mutants and parents was carried out by immunoblot analysis and further confirmed the uniqueness of individual mutants. A complete set of rifampicin-resistant mutants with different genetic and immunogenic properties from the highly virulent genomovar II has been created. These mutants may have the potential of becoming vaccine candidates against columnaris disease.
