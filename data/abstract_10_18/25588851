The aim of the study was to investigate the antiasthmatic effects of eugenol (EUG) and the possible mechanisms. Asthma model was established by ovalbumin induction. A total of 50 mice were randomly assigned to five experimental groups: control, OVA, OVA + dexamethasone (2 mg/kg), OVA + EUG (10 mg/kg), and OVA + EUG (20 mg/kg). Airway resistance (Raw) were measured, histological studies were evaluated by the hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-5 (IL-5) were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Vitamin D3 upregulated protein 1 (VDUP1), IkappaBalpha, P-IkappaBalpha, NF-kappaBP65, and p-NF-kappaBP65 were measured by Western blotting. Our study demonstrated that EUG inhibited OVA-induced increases in Raw and eosinophil count; IL-4 and IL-5 were recovered. Histological studies demonstrated that EUG substantially inhibited OVA-induced eosinophilia in the lung tissue. Western blotting studies demonstrated that EUG substantially inhibited P-IkappaBalpha, NF-kappaBP65, and p-NF-kappaBP65 protein levels and increased VDUP1 and IkappaBalpha protein levels. These findings suggest that EUG may effectively ameliorate the progression of asthma and could be used as a therapy for patients with allergic asthma.
