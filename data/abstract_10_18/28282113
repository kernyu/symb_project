To combat the spread of antibiotic resistance, methods that quantitatively assess the metabolism-inhibiting effects of drugs in a rapid and culture-independent manner are urgently needed. Here using four oral bacteria as models, we show that heavy water (D2O)-based single-cell Raman microspectroscopy (D2O-Raman) can probe bacterial response to different drugs using the Raman shift at the C-D (carbon-deuterium vibration) band in 2040 to 2300 cm(-1) as a universal biomarker for metabolic activity at single-bacterial-cell resolution. The "minimum inhibitory concentration based on metabolic activity" (MIC-MA), defined as the minimal dose under which the median DeltaC-D-ratio at 8 h of drug exposure is </=0 and the standard deviation (SD) of the DeltaC-D ratio among individual cells is </=0.005, was proposed to evaluate the metabolism-inhibiting efficacy of drugs. In addition, heterogeneity index of MIC-MA (MIC-MA-HI), defined as SD of C-D ratio among individual cells, quantitatively assesses the among-cell heterogeneity of metabolic activity after drug regimens. When exposed to 1x MIC of sodium fluoride (NaF), 1x MIC of chlorhexidine (CHX), or 60x MIC of ampicillin, the cariogenic oral pathogen Streptococcus mutans UA159 ceased propagation yet remained metabolically highly active. This underscores the advantage of MIC-MA over the growth-based MIC in being able to detect the "nongrowing but metabolically active" (NGMA) cells that underlie many latent or recurring infections. Moreover, antibiotic susceptible and resistant S. mutans strains can be readily discriminated at as early as 0.5 h. Thus, D2O-Raman can serve as a universal method for rapid and quantitative assessment of antimicrobial effects based on general metabolic activity at single-cell resolution.
