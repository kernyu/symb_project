Copper (Cu) has garnered increasing interest due to its excellent antimicrobial activity and important roles in human metabolism. Although the biological effects of Cu have been studied, the effects of Cu nanoparticles (NPs) on cell behavior are not well understood. In this study, porous TiO2 coatings doped with different amounts of Cu NPs (designated as 0 Cu, 0.3 Cu, and 3.0 Cu) are deposited on titanium by micro-arc oxidation (MAO). The Cu NPs coated samples exhibit excellent antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). In vitro cytocompatibility evaluation discloses that 0 Cu and 0.3 Cu have no toxicity to osteoblasts but 3.0 Cu shows cytotoxicity. 0.3 Cu promotes proliferation and adhesion of osteoblasts and enhances extracellular matrix mineralization (ECM), but has little effects on the alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) and collagen secretion. Surprisingly, the Cu NPs coated samples show a different behavior with endothelial cells. Both 0.3 Cu and 3.0 Cu show no cytotoxicity on endothelial cells and promote cell proliferation. Production of nitric oxide (NO) and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by the endothelial cells are observed from the Cu NPs doped TiO2 coatings.
