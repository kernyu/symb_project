It is unclear whether the use of moxifloxacin (MFX), a newer synthetic fluoroquinolone, results in better outcomes in patients with ofloxacin (OFX)-resistant multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). During the period from April 2006 to December 2013, a total of 2,511 patients with culture-confirmed tuberculosis (TB) were treated at a TB referral hospital in southern Taiwan. Of the 2,511 patients, 325 (12.9%) had MDR-TB, and of those 325 patients, 81 (24.9%) had OFX-resistant MDR-TB and were included in the study. Among the 81 patients with OFX-resistant MDR-TB, 50 (61.7%) were successfully treated and 31 (38.3%) had unfavorable outcomes, including treatment failure (n = 25; 30.9%), loss to follow-up (n = 2; 2.5%), and death (n = 4; 4.9%). Patients treated with MFX had a significantly higher rate of treatment success (77.3% versus 43.2%; odds ratio [OR] = 4.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.710 to 11.646, P = 0.002) than patients not treated with MFX, especially among those infected with MFX-susceptible isolates (40.7%) or isolates with low-level resistance to MFX (28.4%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that treatment with MFX (adjusted odds ratio = 6.54, 95% CI = 1.44 to 29.59, P = 0.015) was the only independent factor associated with treatment success. Mutation at codon 94 in the gyrA gene was the most frequent mutation (68.0%) associated with high-level MFX resistance. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed that treatment with MFX was also an independent factor associated with early culture conversion (hazard ratio = 3.12, 95% CI = 1.48 to 6.54, P = 0.003). Our results show that a significant proportion of OFX-resistant MDR-TB isolates were susceptible or had low-level resistance to MFX, indicating that patients with OFX-resistant MDR-TB benefit from treatment with MFX.
