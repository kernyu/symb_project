Benzamides and tryptamine are biologically significant compounds, therefore, various benzamide analogous of tryptamine have been efficiently synthesized using tryptamine and different benzoyl chlorides, in order to find new biologically active compounds. The resulting products were then characterized by melting point determination, calculation of Rf values and LC-MS techniques. At last, structure activity relationship (SAR) of the synthesized compounds was evaluated against two microbial strains; Bacillus subtilis and Aspergillus niger. All the five prepared products have shown high yield, sharp characterization and significant resistance against the growth of tested microorganism, providing a new range of tryptamine based benzamide derivatives having significant antimicrobial activities.
