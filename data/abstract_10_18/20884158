Increase in multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter poses a serious problem in Korea. In this study, 190 imipenem (IPM)-nonsusceptible (NS) Acinetobacter isolates from 12 Korean hospitals in 2007 were used to determine species, prevalence, and antimicrobial susceptibility of OXA carbapenemase- and metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing isolates. bla(OXA)-(2)(3)-like and ISAba1-asssociated bla(OXA)-(5)(1)-like genes were detected in 80% and 12% of 178 IPM-NS Acinetobacter baumannii isolates, respectively. A novel bla(OXA)-(1)(8)(2) was detected in 12 IPM-NS A. baumannii isolates. Twelve out of 14 MBL-producing isolates were non-baumanniiAcinetobacter. A. baumannii isolates with OXA carbapenemase were more often resistant to aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin, and tigecycline than non-baumannii Acinetobacter isolates with MBL. Identical pulsed- field gel electrophoresis patterns were observed in 89% of A. baumannii isolates with bla(OXA)-(2)(3)-like gene. In conclusion, extremely rapid increase of IPM-NS A. baumannii in previous Korean studies was mainly due to clonal spread of OXA-23-producing A. baumannii isolates. A novel OXA-182 emerged in Korea.
