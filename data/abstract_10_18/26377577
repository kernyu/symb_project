BACKGROUND: We previously demonstrated that hyperglycemia could suppress apolipoprotein M (apoM) synthesis both in vivo and in vitro; however, the mechanism of hyperglycemia-induced downregulation of apoM expression is unknown yet. METHODS: In the present study we further examined if hexosamine pathway, one of the most important pathways of glucose turnover, being involved in modulating apoM expression in the hyperglycemia condition. We examined the effect of glucosamine, a prominent component of hexosamine pathway and intracellular mediator of insulin resistance, on apoM expression in HepG2 cells and in rat's models. In the present study we also determined apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1) as a control gene. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that glucosamine could even up-regulate both apoM and apoA1 expressions in HepG2 cell cultures. The glucosamine induced upregulation of apoM expression could be blocked by addition of azaserine, an inhibitor of hexosamine pathway. Moreover, intravenous infusion of glucosamine could enhance hepatic apoM expression in rats, although serum apoM levels were not significantly influences. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that both exogenous and endogenous glucosamine were essential for the over-expression of apoM, which may suggest that the increased intracellular content of glucosamine does not be responsible for the depressed apoM expression at hyperglycemia condition.
