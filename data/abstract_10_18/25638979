The aim of this study was to determine the percentage of participation of particular species of microorganisms, isolated from the uterus of cows with endometritis and from cows without inflammatory lesions of the uterus, in the same postpartum period. The aim of the study was also to examine how long after parturition non-treated endometritis persists. Moreover, antibiotic susceptibility tests were carried out of the bacterial isolates dominating in the uterus. Forty cows were included in the study: 20 cows with endometritis (experimental group) and 20 cows without any inflammatory condition of the uterus (control group). The material for cytological and bacteriological tests was collected on the 5th, 26th, 40th and 60th day after parturition, using an intrauterine brush adapted for cows. The total number of collected isolates was 149, including 120 isolates from the uterus of cows with endometritis and 29 isolates from the uterus of cows without endometritis. The following species of microorganisms were isolated from the material collected from cows with endometritis: T. pyogenes (49.2%), E.coli (22.5%), F. necrophorum (11.7%), Staphylococcus sp. (6.7%), B. melaninogenicus (5.8%), and Streptococcus sp. (4.1%). The participation percentage of particular species of bacteria in the material collected from the uterus of cows without endometritis was as follows: T. pyogenes (27.6%), E.coli (24.2%), Staphylococcus sp. (20.7%), Streptococcus sp. (20.7%), B. melaninogenicus (3.4%) and F. necrophorum (3.4%). The highest percentage of T. pyogenes isolates was susceptible to ceftiofur (89.6%); cefoperazone (85.1%) and amoxicillin combined with clavulanic acid (79.1%). E. coli isolates were most susceptible to amoxicillin combined with clavulanic acid (100%), cefoperazone (94.1%) and oxytetracycline (82.3%).
