It is imperative to research the treatment strategy for infections caused by multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria, as there are increasing reports showing that more and more patients are decimated by the infections of MDR bacteria and the development of antimicrobial drugs is in downturn. Current researches mainly focus on the following three aspects: developing new antimicrobial agents with the aid of basic scientific achievements in finding new antibacterial targets, achieving antimicrobial purpose by specific lysis of host bacteria with phages of high specificity, and killing bacteria potently by destroying its cytomembrane using broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptides.
