Optimal defense theory predicts that induction of defensive secondary metabolites in plants will be inversely correlated with constitutive expression of those compounds. Here, we asked whether camalexin, an important defense against fungal and bacterial pathogens, support this prediction in structured natural populations of Arabidopsis thaliana from the Iberian Peninsula. In common garden experiments, we found that genotypes from the VIE population constitutively hyper-accumulated camalexin. Camalexin concentrations were not induced significantly when plants were exposed to a temperature of 10 degrees C for 48h. However, they were induced when plants were exposed to 48h of infection by the virulent bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000. Genotypes from the VIE population with the hyper-accumulation of camalexin were significantly more resistant to bacterial growth. Induction of camalexin was negatively correlated with constitutive camalexin concentrations following log transformation and two different corrections for autocorrelation, thus supporting the tradeoff predicted by optimal defense theory. Constitutive overexpression of camalexin was not explained by the only known natural genetic polymorphism at the Accelerated Cell Death 6, ACD6, locus. Collectively, the results support an important role of camalexin in defense against P. syringae as well as significant structured variation in defense levels within wild populations.
