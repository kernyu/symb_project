OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to provide a rapid, accurate and cost-effective diagnostic real time polymerase chain reaction-high resolution melting curve assay (PCR-HRM) to identify and distinguish between four different mycoplasmas and Acholeplasma laidlawii isolated at cow-level from a single commercial dairy farm in South Australia. One set of genus-level universal primers was designed targeting the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. RESULTS: Real time PCR-HRM analysis was able to identify and distinguish between five different mollicutes, namely A. laidlawii, M. arginini, M. bovirhinis, M. bovis and uncultured Mycoplasma. Results were confirmed through sequencing. Our developed assay provides rapid and accurate screening for Mycoplasma mastitis detection.
