OBJECTIVE: To study a cohort of patients with intra-abdominal postsurgical infection treated with tigecycline to analyze its effectiveness and mortality related factors. METHODS: Prospective study of patients with intra-abdominal postsurgical infection with microbiological isolation and treated with tigecycline. RESULTS: Out of 103 patients only 61 full fit inclusion criteria. Mean age was 67 year-old and 72% were male. Charlson score was >/= 3 in 65.5%, being diabetes and colon cancer the most prevalent diseases. Cancer surgery was the most frequent procedure (n=44, 72%) and previous antibiotic administration was present in 43 cases (69%). Pitt score was >/= 3 in 69% and most prevalent bacteria were Escherichia coli (38 %), Enterococcus spp. (34%; mainly Enterococcus faecium) and Klebsiella pneumoniae together with Enterobacter cloacae (28%). Tigecycline was prescribed alone (17; 28%) or in combination with other antibiotics (44; 72%), mainly meropenem (25; 57%) or amikacin (19, 43%). 11 patients died (18%), all of which suffered extended cancer surgery and isolation of extended-spectrum betalactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae. Factors statistically associated to death in univariate analysis were Charlson score >3, pH <7.3 and leucocyte count >20.000 cells/mm3. CONCLUSIONS: As being a cohort of patients treated with tigecycline, E. faecium isolation was very frequent. Non-fatal evolution was achieved in 82% cases, being tigecycline a potentially good option in the empiric treatment of very severe infections.
