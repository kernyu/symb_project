Objective: To study the infection status, serotypes, drug resistance and molecular characteristics of Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio parahemolyticus, enterotoxigenic Escherichia (E.) coli (ETEC), pathogenic E. coli (EPEC), Shiga Toxin producing E. coli (STEC) and Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) collected from diarrhea patients in Guangdong. Methods: The strains of Salmonella, Shigella, V. parahemolyticus and 4 kinds of E. coli isolated from foodborne diseases surveillance during 2013-2014 were collected to conduct serotyping, drug resistance test and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Results: A total of 3 372 stains of pathogens were isolated from 57 834 stool samples during 2013-2014, the overall positive rate was 5.83% and the positive rate of Salmonella was highest, followed by that of V. parahemolyticus, 4 kinds of E. coli and Shigella. And 3 213 strains of Salmonella were divided into 143 serotypes. The most prevalent serotypes were Salmonella typhimurium, 4, 5, 12: i:-, Enteritidis, Stanley and Derby. Salmonella was sensitive to cephalosporin and fluoroquinolones, and showed significant differences in drug resistance rate among different serotypes. In top 10 common serotypes, S. enteritidis and S. derby were most resistant to cephalosporin and ciprofloxacin respectively. PFGE was performed for 2 289 strains of Salmonella, showing distribution diversity and significant fingerprint polymorphisms. The 85 strains of V. parahemolyticus were divided into 10 serotypes, O3ratioK6 (61.18%) was the most common serotype, followed by O4ratioK8. The results showed that the carrying rate of virulence genes tdh (81.18%) was high, while the carrying rate of trh was low (7.06%), and there were 10 strains carrying no the two kinds of virulence genes. The sensitive rate of V. parahemolyticus to imipenem, nalidixic acid, SMZ-TMP, chloramphenicol and tetracycline were more than 95%. Thirteen strains of Shigella were detected, including 9 strains of Shigella sonnei, 3 strains of Shigella flexneri and 1 strains of Shigella bogdii. The strains all showed sensitivity to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and chloramphenicol (76.92%). There were 86 strains of E. coli detected, including 29 strains of ETEC (33.72%), 27 strains of EPEC (31.39%), 27 strains of STEC (31.39%) and 3 strains of EIEC (3.48%). Conclusions: In the active etiological surveillance for foodborne diseases in Guangdong during 2013-2014, the detection rate of Salmonella was highest (5.57% ), followed by that of V. parahemolyticus, 4 kinds of E. coli and Shigella. Salmonella, V. parahemolyticus and Shigella were sensitive to cephalosporin and fluoroquinolones. Clustered cases of Salmonella infection were found in the surveillance, but no outbreaks occurred.
