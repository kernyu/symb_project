The ability to sense and respond to the environment is essential for the survival of all living organisms. Bacterial pathogens such as Salmonella enterica are of particular interest due to their ability to sense and adapt to the diverse range of conditions they encounter, both in vivo and in environmental reservoirs. During this cycling from host to non-host environments, Salmonella encounter a variety of environmental insults ranging from temperature fluctuations, nutrient availability and changes in osmolarity, to the presence of antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species. Such fluctuating conditions impact on various areas of bacterial physiology including virulence, growth and antimicrobial resistance. A key component of the success of any bacterial pathogen is the ability to recognize and mount a suitable response to the discrete chemical and physical stresses elicited by the host. Such responses occur through a coordinated and complex programme of gene expression and protein activity, involving a range of transcriptional regulators, sigma factors and two component regulatory systems. This review briefly outlines the various stresses encountered throughout the Salmonella life cycle and the repertoire of regulatory responses with which Salmonella counters. In particular, how these Gram-negative bacteria are able to alleviate disruption in periplasmic envelope homeostasis through a group of stress responses, known collectively as the Envelope Stress Responses, alongside the mechanisms used to overcome nitrosative stress, will be examined in more detail.
