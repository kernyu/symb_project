UNLABELLED: Introduction : One of the major worldwide public health problems today are the infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), among which carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP), constitutes one of the most common pathogens causing nosocomial infection. OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed at describing the dissemination of KPC-3 enzyme-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in clinical isolates from hospitals in Bogota. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-two CRKP isolates collected from 10 hospitals in Bogota from 2008-2010 were analysed; disk diffusion and microdilution were used for phenotypic detection of enzymes and PCR for genotyping. Automated and manual methods were used for determining profiles for antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) with 13 agents. PFGE was used for obtaining the isolates genetic relationship. RESULTS: This study gives an overview of CRKP patterns in 10 hospitals in Bogota which were found to present resistance to multiple antibiotic families. The CRKPs were grouped in different clones, each having different subtypes, and were spread in the 10 hospitals over the three-year period (2008-2010). CONCLUSIONS: The dissemination of KPC-3-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae nosocomial isolates in Bogota highlights the need for strengthening epidemiological surveillance against this type of microorganism and the development of specific priority activities for preventing and controlling such infection.
