AIM: Study the possibility of formation of induced resistance of purulent-septic infection (PSI) causative agents against disinfectants (DI) in bactericidal concentrations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Daily exposure to bactericidal concentrations of preparations from the group of quaternary ammonium compounds (QAC) on Enterobacter cloacae strain that has incomplete sensitivity to the same disinfectants on the same test objects was carried out in experiments on test objects from wood and plastic. Exposure was carried out until the moment of transition from incomplete sensitivity to resistance. RESULTS: E. cloacae strain that initially had incomplete sensitivity to various disinfectants of the QAC group in antibacterial concentrations according to manuals acquires resistance on test objects from wood and plastic after 2 - 12 exposures to the preparations. CONCLUSION: The data obtained give evidence that the resistance of PSI causative agents to disinfectants can take place not only under the influence of low concentrations of the preparations but also during use of disinfectants at bactericidal concentrations.
