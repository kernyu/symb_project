A series of C-12 pyrazolinyl spiro ketolide derivatives were designed and synthesized. The C-12 modifications involved replacing the natural C-12 methyl group in clarithromycin core with different pyrazolinyl spiros via chemical synthesis. Potential anti-bacterial activities against both erythromycin-susceptible and erythromycin-resistant bacteria were reported.
