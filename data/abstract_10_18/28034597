Worldwide increasing emergence of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. has rendered the limited availability of effective antimicrobial agents and has become a major public health concern. In this study, we report the draft genome sequence of A. pittii TCM156, a multidrug-resistant isolate that harbored the blaOXA-357 gene. The genome sequence was further analyzed by various bioinformatics methods. The genome size was estimated to be 3,807,313bp with 3508 predicted coding regions and G+C content is 38.7%. These findings have raised awareness of the possible emergence of OXA-type enzyme-producing A. pittii isolate in China.
