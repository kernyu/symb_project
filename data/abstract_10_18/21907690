PURPOSE: Pneumonia is the most common infectious complication of drowning. Pneumonia is potentially life threatening and should be treated by effective antibiotic therapy. However the risk factors, microbiological causes, diagnostic approach and appropriate therapy for pneumonia associated with drowning are not well described. The microbiological ecology of the body of water where immersion occurred could be of import. The aim of this study was to report on microorganisms involved in pneumonia associated with drowning and out of hospital cardiac arrest after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Additionally, we retrieved and undertook microbiological analysis on samples of water from our local river. METHODS: This retrospective study included all patients having suffered an out of hospital cardiac arrest due to drowning and admitted to our tertiary care academic hospital between 2002 and 2010. Data concerning bacteriological lung samples (tracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage) at admission were reported and compared to bacteriological samples obtained from our local river (the river Seine). RESULTS: A total of thirty-seven patients were included in the study. Lung samples were obtained for twenty-one of these patients. Lung samples were positive in nineteen cases, with a high frequency of multi-drug resistant bacteria. Samples from the Seine River found microorganisms similar to those found in drowning associated pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Drowning associated pneumonia can be due to multi drug resistant bacteria. When treating drowning associated pneumonia, antibiotics should be effective against bacteria similar to those found in the body of water where immersion occurred.
