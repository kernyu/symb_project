We describe the case of NDM-1-producing Leclercia adecarboxylata recovered from the clinical sample of a patient hospitalized for a trauma-related injury to his foot. The isolate was resistant to all beta-lactams, quinolones, trimetroprim-sulfametoxazol, gentamicin and tobramicyn. The blaNDM-1 gene was located in a conjugative plasmid that also contained the blaSHV-12 gene and was preceded by a disrupted insertion sequence of ISAba125. The plasmid belongs to the incompatibility group X3, which is known to be an important vector for NDM-1 dissemination in China. This is the first reported case of NDM-1L. adecarboxylata in our country and evidences that species of uncertain clinical relevance can act as hidden sources of clinically important resistance determinants.
