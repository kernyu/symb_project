Multidrug/multixenobiotic resistance (MDR/MXR) confers resistance to a diverse range of potentially toxic pharmaceuticals and environmental contaminants through a cellular response that involves the coordinated induction and activity of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and the Phase I metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A). In mammals, ligand-mediated pregnane X receptor (PXR) transcriptional activity regulates the induction of P-gp and CYP3A; however, this mechanism has not been well-characterized in piscine species. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) treated with the Pxr agonist pregnenolone 16alpha-carbonitrile (PCN) showed decreased P-gp (zebrafish Abcb4) and CYP3A (zebrafish Cyp3a65) mRNA levels after 48h exposure; however, treatment with PCN also resulted in increased hepatic MDR/MXR functional activity (i.e. increased Rhodamine 123 efflux) in vivo. Consistent with mammalian-like MDR/MXR regulated by PXR, the PCN-mediated modulation of hepatic Abcb4 and Cyp3a65 mRNA levels and MDR/MXR functional activity was attenuated by co-treatment with PCN and the mammalian PXR antagonist, ketoconazole (KTC). These results provide evidence that zebrafish Pxr may play a role in MDR/MXR through transcriptional regulation of abcb4 and cyp3a65 gene expression.
