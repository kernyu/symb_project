To determine whether spatiotemporal information could help predict multidrug resistance at the time of tuberculosis diagnosis, we investigated tuberculosis patients who underwent drug susceptibility testing in Lima, Peru, during 2005-2007. We found that crude representation of spatial location at the level of the health center improved prediction of multidrug resistance.
