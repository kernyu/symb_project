Mycoplasma genitalium is a significant pathogen for which first-line treatment is becoming less effective due to increased resistance to macrolides. As conventional culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing is not feasible for routine detection of this pathogen, molecular markers such as detection of mutations in the 23S rRNA gene have been described to predict resistance. Recently, a novel multiplex quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay, ResistancePlus MG, has been described for the simultaneous detection of Mycoplasma genitalium and macrolide resistance. In the current study, the clinical performance of the assay was evaluated on 1,089 consecutive urine and anogenital swab samples in symptomatic and asymptomatic male and female patients. Overall, 6.0% were positive for M. genitalium, with 63.1% having macrolide resistance-associated mutations. Compared to the laboratory-validated qPCR method targeting the 16S rRNA gene and Sanger sequencing to determine 23S rRNA mutations, the sensitivity and specificity of M. genitalium detection were 98.5% and 100% and for detection of macrolide resistance mutations were 100.0% and 96.2%, respectively. This assay offers a considerable advantage in clinical settings for M. genitalium testing by making the results of macrolide resistance and mutation analyses simultaneously available, which is increasingly important with escalating macrolide resistance.
