The growing use of immunosuppressive therapies has resulted in a dramatic increased incidence of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, a common pathogen, and is also associated with a high mortality rate. Azoles are the primary guideline-recommended therapy agents for first-line treatment and prevention of IFIs. However, increased azole usage in medicinal and agricultural settings has caused azole-resistant isolates to repeatedly emerge in the environment, resulting in a significant threat to human health. In this review, we present and summarize current research on the resistance mechanisms of azoles in A. fumigatus as well as efficient susceptibility testing methods. Moreover, we analyze and discuss the putative clinical (bedside) indication of these findings from bench work.
