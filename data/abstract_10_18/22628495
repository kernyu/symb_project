Propionibacterium acnes, a non-spore-forming, anaerobic gram-positive bacterium, is most notably recognized for its association with acne vulgaris (I. Kurokawa et al., Exp. Dermatol. 18:821-832, 2009). We now present the draft genome sequence of an antibiotic-resistant P. acnes strain, PRP-38, isolated from an acne patient in the United Kingdom and belonging to the novel type IC cluster.
