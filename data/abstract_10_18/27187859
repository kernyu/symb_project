The development of treatments for influenza that inhibit the M2 proton channel without being susceptible to the widespread resistance mechanisms associated with the adamantanes is an ongoing challenge. Using a yeast high-throughput yeast growth restoration assay designed to identify M2 channel inhibitors, a single screening hit was uncovered. This compound (3), whose structure was incorrectly identified in the literature, is an inhibitor with similar potency to amantadine against WT M2. A library of derivatives of 3 was prepared and activity against WT M2 and the two principal mutant strains (V27A and S31N) was assessed in the yeast assay. The best compounds were further evaluated in an antiviral plaque reduction assay using engineered WT, V27A and S31N M2 influenza A strains with otherwise identical genetic background. Compound 63 was found to inhibit all three virus strains in this cell based antiviral assay at micromolar concentrations, possibly through a mechanism other than M2 inhibition.
