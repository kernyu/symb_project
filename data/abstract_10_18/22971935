Enterobacteriaceae, carrying the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) gene (bla (NDM-1)), have emerged and posed a threat since 2006. In Japan, bla (NDM-1)-carrying Escherichia coli was first described in 2010. In this study, we characterized NDM-1-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae strain 419 in Japan, which was isolated from the urine of a 90-year-old Japanese patient who had never been to the Indian subcontinent. K. pneumoniae 419 belonged to ST42. It possessed a surface capsule (with untypeable capsular PCR types) and was resistant to serum killing. K. pneumoniae 419 cells were occasionally flagellated or piliated and autoaggregated. K. pneumoniae 419 was resistant to beta-lactams (including carbapenems), aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones, and was susceptible to imipenem (or biapenem), aztreonam, polymixin B, and colistin. It possessed at least eight plasmids; of those, a 74-kb plasmid (pKPJ1) of the replicon FIIA carried bla (NDM-1) and was conjugally transferred to E. coli strains, with a 71-kb transferable azithromycin-resistant (mphA (+)) plasmid of the replicon F (pKPJ2), as a large (145-kb) plasmid (pKPJF100) through a transposition event. In addition to bla (NDM-1), pKPJ1 carried arr-2, pKPJ2 carried mphA, and pKPJF100 carried both. They were negative for the 16S rRNA methylase gene, e.g., which is frequently associated with bla (NDM-1). The data demonstrate that K. pneumoniae 419 possessed virulence- and fitness-associated surface structures, was resistant to serum killing, and possessed a unique (or rare) genetic background in terms of ST type and bla (NDM-1)-carrying plasmid.
