BACKGROUND: Although treatment-emergent NS3/4A protease inhibitor (PI)-resistant variants typically decrease in frequency after cessation of PI therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, HCV susceptibility to PIs in patients who have not responded to previous PI therapy has not been addressed. METHODS: Patients with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection were treated either with simeprevir plus interferon or with daclatasvir plus asunaprevir. Frequencies of drug-resistant mutations among patients with treatment failure were analyzed by deep sequencing. Human hepatocyte chimeric mice were injected with serum samples obtained from either treatment-naive patients or nonresponders to treatment with daclatasvir plus asunaprevir and then were treated with simeprevir and sofosbuvir. RESULTS: Virological response to daclatasvir plus asunaprevir treatment was significantly lower in patients with simeprevir treatment failure as compared to those without previous treatment. Deep-sequencing analysis showed that the frequency of PI treatment-emergent NS3-D168 mutations gradually decreased and were completely replaced by wild-type genes after cessation of therapy. However, mice injected with serum obtained from a patient with PI treatment failure rapidly developed NS3-D168 mutations at significantly higher frequencies following either simeprevir or sofosbuvir treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The virological response to daclatasvir plus asunaprevir treatment was low in patients with simeprevir treatment failure. PI resistance remains even after disappearance of mutant strains by deep sequencing.
