AIMS: Obesity is a major risk for hypertension. Endothelial dysfunction contributes to increased peripheral vascular resistance and subsequent hypertension. Autophagy regulates endothelial function, however, whether autophagy is related to hypertension in obesity remains largely unclear. We wished to ascertain: (i) the role of autophagy in obesity-induced hypertension and the underlying mechanisms; (ii) if tetrahydroxystilbene glycoside (TSG) influences endothelial dysfunction and obesity-associated hypertension. METHODS: (TSG-treated) male Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats and cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were used. Blood pressure was measured non-invasively with a tail-cuff system. Westernblotting was performed to determine the expression of autophagy-associated proteins. Autophagy flux was assessed by transfection HUVECs with the Ad-mGFP-RFP-LC3. RESULTS: Compared with their lean counterparts, obese ZDF rats exhibited hypertension and endothelial dysfunction, along with impaired Akt/mTOR signaling and upregulated expression of autophagy-associated proteins beclin1, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 II/I, autophagy protein (ATG)5 and ATG7. Two-week TSG administration restored blood pressure and endothelial function, reactivated Akt/mTOR pathway and decreased endothelial autophagy in ZDF rats. Rapamycin pretreatment blocked the hypotensive effect of TSG in ZDF rats. Suppression of Akt/mTOR expression with siRNA significantly blunted the anti-autophagic effect of TSG in HUVECs as evidenced by abnormal autophagic flux and increased expression of autophagy-associated proteins. CONCLUSION: Endothelial dysfunction in ZDF rats is partially attributable to excessive autophagy. TSG improves endothelial function and exerts hypotensive effects via regulation of endothelial autophagy.
