Macrolide antimicrobials are commonly prescribed, specifically for the treatment of respiratory tract infections. Although still effective, the development of widespread macrolide resistance has limited their use. Aside from their antimicrobial effects, macrolides are also known to possess immune-modulatory properties which may confer a survival benefit in both acute and chronic inflammatory states. This review discusses the efficacy, potential mechanisms, and adverse effects of macrolide therapy specifically in community-acquired pneumonia in outpatients, hospitalized ward patients, and those requiring intensive care unit admission. Challenges for ongoing research in this field are discussed and treatment recommendations offered.
