The mouse lymphoma L5178Y Tk(+/-) assay is broadly used in toxicology to assess genotoxicity because of its known sensitivity to genotoxicants that act through a variety of mechanisms, which may include epigenetic DNA methylation. This brief article highlights the studies that have contributed to this conjecture and suggests an addition to the experimental design that could identify if the test substance is a potential epimutagen acting via hypermethylation.
