Pegylated interferon (IFN) alpha-2a or 2b in combination with ribavirin for children aged 3 years and older is the standard treatment for paediatric chronic hepatitis C. This treatment regimen was developed firstly in adults. In recent years, a number of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) are under development for treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. These agents block viral replication inhibiting directly one of the several steps of HCV lifecycle. DAAs are classified into several categories based on their molecular target: HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitors, HCV NS5B polymerase inhibitors and HCV NS5A inhibitors. Other promising compounds are cyclophilin A inhibitors, mi-RNA122 and IFN-lambda. Several new drugs associations will be developed in the near future starting from the actual standard of care. IFN-based and IFN-free regimens are being studied in adults. In this constantly evolving scenario new drug regimens targeted and suitable for children would be possible in the next future. Especially for children, it is crucial to identify the right combination of drugs with the highest potency, barrier to resistance and the best safety profile.
