The prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) remains problematic in both hospital and community settings. Investigations of MRSA existing in the local area are necessary to understand the detailed epidemiology of healthcare-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA). In the present study, molecular epidemiological analysis was performed on 584 MRSA isolated from four hospitals in Tokyo, Japan. In the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis, four epidemic pulsotypes (I to IV) were found. The isolates of the epidemic pulsotype I mainly consisted of the SCCmec type II, toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 gene (tst)-negative, spa type t002, and ST764 clones. The ST764 clone, which is a novel hybrid variant of the ST5 HA-MRSA lineage with the arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME), was first found in Niigata, Japan. However, no ACME genes were detected in the isolates of the epidemic pulsotype I. In contrast, the other isolates of the epidemic pulsotypes mainly consisted of the SCCmec type II, tst-positive, spa type t002, and ST5 clones, which are the most predominant clones of HA-MRSA in Japan. Resistance rates of non-beta-lactams for the isolates of the epidemic pulsotype I were higher than those of the other epidemic pulsotypes. Our data showed that the novel ACME-negative ST764 clones are being distributed throughout multiple hospitals in Tokyo. The ST764 clones in Tokyo have the potential to acquire ACME in the future, because the ACME-positive ST764 clones have already been found in both hospital and community settings in other areas of Japan.
