This review focuses on the virulence arsenal of the most pathogenic species among Gram positive anaerobic cocci, Finegoldia magna according to recently published data from 2012 to 2016. Virulence factors like sortase dependent pili and F. magna adhesion factor (FAF) facilitate the start of the infection. Albumin binding protein (PAB) enhances F. magna survival. FAF, subtilisin-like extracellular serine protease (SufA) and superantigen protein L protect the bacteria from factors of innate defense system. SufA, capsule and tissue-destroying enzymes provide a deep penetration or spread of the infections and the protein L is associated with infection severity. Biofilm production results in infection chronification and complicated treatment as well as to persistence of multi-species biofilms. Resistance rates to quinolones (13.0->70%) and clindamycin (0-40.0%) are important, and resistance to penicillins (<4%), chloramphenicol (7.0%) and metronidazole (<7%) has been reported. F. magna should not be overlooked when present in monoinfections or mixed infections in humans.
