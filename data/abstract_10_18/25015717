This study was designed to evaluate the combined effect of probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus and bacteriophage SA11 on the control of antibiotic-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (ASSA) and antibiotic-resistant S. aureus (ARSA) under the simulated intestinal conditions. The survivability of ASSA and ARSA were determined in the simulated phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-, trypticase soy broth (TSB)-, and milk-based gastric juices adjusted to pH 2.0, 3.0, and 5.0 at 37 degrees C for 30 min. The inhibitory effect of bacteriophage SA11 and probiotic on the growth of ASSA and ARSA was evaluated in the simulated intestinal juices at 37 degrees C for 20 h. The least reductions in the numbers of ASSA and ARSA were observed in the milk-based gastric juices at pH 2.0 (<1 log). No significant changes in the teichoic acid-mediated sliding motility were observed for ASSA and ARSA after 30-min exposure to the simulated gastric juices (pH 2.0, 3.0, and 5.0), responsible for the enhanced bacterial attachment to the epithelial cells. The bacteriophage SA11 was stable down to pH 5.0 and up to 0.06 % bile salts. The bacteriophage SA11 combined with probiotic effectively inhibited the growth of ASSA and ARSA in the simulated intestinal conditions, showing more than 4 log reduction. The relative expression levels of adhesion-related genes (clfA, eno, and fnbA) and efflux-related genes (mdeA, norB, and norC) were less decreased in ARSA than in ASSA after exposure to the simulated gastrointestinal conditions. These results might shed light on the application of bacteriophage to control the ingested antibiotic-resistant foodborne pathogens in the intestinal tract.
