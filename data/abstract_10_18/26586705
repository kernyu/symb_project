BACKGROUND: The Genotype MTBDRsl is a new-generation PCR-based line-probe assay for rapid identification of the resistance to the second-line antituberculosis drugs with a single strip. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the performance of Genotype MTBDRsl in detecting drug resistance to fluoroquinolones, amikacin, capreomycin, kanamycin and ethambutol in comparison with the phenotypic drug susceptibility test. DESIGN: We searched Pubmed, Embase and the Cochrane Library and calculated the sensitivity, the specificity, the positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI), and the area under the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves (AUC), and tested heterogeneity in accuracy estimates with the Spearman correlation coefficient and Chi-square. RESULTS: The summarized sensitivity (95% CI), specificity (95% CI), and AUC (standard error) were 0.869 (0.847-0.890), 0.973 (0.965-0.979) and 0.9690 (0.0188) for fluoroquinolones, 0.868 (0.829-0.900), 0.998 (0.994-0.999) and 0.9944 (0.0050) for amikacin, 0.879 (0.838-0.914), 0.970 (0.958-0.978) and 0.9791 (0.0120) for capreomycin, 0.501 (0.461-0.541), 0.991 (0.983-0.996) and 0.9814 (0.0114) for kanamycin and 0.686 (0.663-0.709), 0.871 (0.852-0.888) and 0.7349 (0.0639) for ethambutol, respectively. CONCLUSION: The genotype MTBDRsl demonstrate excellent accuracy for detecting drug resistance to fluoroquinolones, amikacin, and capreomycin, but it may not be an appropriate choice for detection of kanamycin and ethambutol.
