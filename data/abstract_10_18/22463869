Fifteen isolates with reduced susceptibility to meropenem were obtained from hospital sewage. They contained bla(KPC-2) and belonged to multiple clones of Citrobacter freundii or Enterobacter cloacae. bla(KPC-2) was commonly carried by self-transmissible plasmids with different EcoRI-restricted patterns. Tn2 was identified upstream of bla(KPC-2), while ISKpn6 lay downstream. Hospital sewage could be an important reservoir of bla(KPC-2) and warrants more studies.
