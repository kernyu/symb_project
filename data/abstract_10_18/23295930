Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is a multidrug-resistant organism increasingly isolated from the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. One hundred twenty-five S. maltophilia isolates from 85 CF patients underwent planktonic and biofilm susceptibility testing against 9 different antibiotics, alone and in double antibiotic combinations. When S. maltophilia isolates were grown as a biofilm, 4 of the 10 most effective antibiotic combinations included high-dose levofloxacin and 7 of the 10 combinations included colistin at doses achievable by aerosolization.
