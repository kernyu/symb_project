Antiviral effect of interferon is mediated by the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). However, because of the difficulty in obtaining paired liver biopsies before and after interferon treatment, the key ISGs expressed in human hepatocytes and responsible for interferon-based antiviral activities in chronic hepatitis C remain illusive. Prior to a standard course of peginterferon plus ribavirin therapy, 104 patients underwent a liver biopsy. A small piece of the liver biopsy sample from each patient was submitted for ex vivo tissue culture in the presence or absence of interferon. Hepatic expression of 8 ISGs was detected by RT-PCR. The ISG expression patterns and clinicopathological variables were correlated with subsequent treatment outcomes. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that hepatic MxA expression (P = 0.008) and leucocyte count (P = 0.040) independently predicted the end of therapeutic virological response, while hepatic OAS1 expression (P = 0.003), genotype 1 (P = 0.002), HCV-RNA level (P = 0.007), AST/ALT ratio (P = 0.004) and leucocyte count (P = 0.034) independently predicted the sustained virological response. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that interferon-induced OAS1 expression localized to the hepatocytes. In conclusion, hepatic MxA and OAS1 expression predicted, respectively, the end of therapeutic and sustained virological responses in interferon-based treatment of chronic hepatitis C.
