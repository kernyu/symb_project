Influenza epidemics and pandemics are constant threats to human health. The application of antiviral drugs provides an immediate and direct control of influenza virus infection. At present, the major strategy for managing patients with influenza is through targeting conserved viral proteins critical for viral replication. Two classes of conventional antiviral drugs, the M2 ion channel blockers and the neuraminidase inhibitors, are frequently used. In recent years, increasing levels of resistance to both drug classes has become a major public health concern, highlighting the urgent need for the development of alternative treatments. Novel classes of antiviral compounds or biomolecules targeting viral replication mechanism are under development, using approaches including high-throughput small-molecule screening platforms and structure-based designs. In response to influenza virus infection, host cellular mechanisms are triggered to defend against the invaders. At the same time, viruses as obligate intracellular pathogens have evolved to exploit cellular responses in support of their efficient replication, including antagonizing the host type I interferon response as well as activation of specific cellular pathways at different stages of the replication cycle. Numerous studies have highlighted the possibility of targeting virus-host interactions and host cellular mechanisms to develop new treatment regimens. This review aims to give an overview of current and novel concepts targeting the virus and the host for managing influenza.
