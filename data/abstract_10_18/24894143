Poorly controlled HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy, especially the use of protease inhibitors, are among the causes that contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease in people living with HIV (PLWH). Poor lifestyle choices (smoking, lack of physical activity, poor diet) and individual factors such as high stress, physical or emotional trauma, depression, and so forth contribute to the overall risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The purpose of this review was to critically evaluate the more recent aerobic and resistance exercise studies and their impact on cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors in PLWH.
