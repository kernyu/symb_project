BACKGROUND: Recent analysis of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia has identified a novel family of resistance genes (Smqnr) encoding pentapeptide repeat proteins, which confer low-level resistance to quinolones. This study describes further novel variants present in clinical isolates of S. maltophilia and investigates their effect on resistance to a number of quinolones in an Escherichia coli host. METHODS: PCR for Smqnr alleles was carried out on a selection of S. maltophilia from clinical specimens, and amplicons were cloned and transformed in E. coli TOP10 cells. Transformed colonies carrying the plasmid were tested for susceptibility to a range of quinolones by MIC determination. DNA sequences were determined and translated peptide sequences compared with known SmQnr sequences. RESULTS: Thirteen isolates were found to contain Smqnr alleles, of which six corresponded to previously identified Smqnr sequences, while seven were novel variants. Increases in quinolone MICs compared with wild-type E. coli TOP10 were seen for all strains transformed with Smqnr alleles. CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable diversity within Smqnr alleles. S. maltophilia may be a significant reservoir for the dissemination of quinolone resistance elements to Enterobacteriaceae.
