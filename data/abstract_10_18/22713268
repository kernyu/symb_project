Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients have risk factors for acquisition of antibiotic-resistant organisms such as MRSA. In a recent study, we have shown a rising prevalence of MRSA infection among hospitalized IBD patients. This population is at increased risk of infection and its associated mortality. These findings underscore the need for infection control measures in the hospital setting.
