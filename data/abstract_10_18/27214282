The multidrug-resistant sequence type 131 (ST131) Escherichia coli is a spreading epidemiological burden particularly among isolates resistant to fluoroquinolones. We aimed to evaluate the commonality of ST131-O25b and ST131-O16 among fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli isolates causing community-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs) at Fayoum University Hospital, in Egypt. Ninety-two fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli isolates were subjected to multiplex PCR for detection of ST131 of either O25b or O16 subgroups. Positive isolates were then assessed for antimicrobial susceptibility and virulence genotyping. Out of 92 fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli isolates, 56 (60.9%) isolates were O25b/O16 subgroups of ST131, including 44 (78.6%) ST131-O25b and 12 (21.4%) ST131-O16 subgroups. All the O25b/O16 ST131 isolates were sensitive to meropenem, where ST131-O25b isolates were significantly more resistant to extended spectrum cephalosporins compared to S131-O16 strains. All the O25b/O16 ST131 isolates harbored three or more of the virulence factors associated with extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli status. ST131-O16 showed a significantly higher virulence score than ST131-O25b isolates. Our results bring to highlight the emergence of O25b/O16 ST131 isolates between community acquired UTIs among Egyptian patients. This is the first report for the presence of O16 isolates in Egypt, showing a lower predominance than the O25b subgroup. The high prevalence of O25b/O16 ST131 isolates requires strict stewardship on antimicrobial use, notably fluoroquinolones, to control the endemicity of such emerging multidrug-resistant clone in the community.
