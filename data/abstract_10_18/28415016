Antibiotics are used in ethanol production to discourage the growth of bacteria that would result in lower ethanol content and a lower quality product. A survey conducted by the FDA (FY 2010 Nationwide Survey of Distillers Grains for Antibiotic Residues, 2009 [1]) revealed that the residues of these antibiotics can remain in the distillers grains (DG) by-product, which is used as an animal feed ingredient. The low levels of antibiotic residues in DG could be a public health concern, as they could lead to antimicrobial resistance. To enable the quantitative determination of these antibiotics (erythromycin, penicillin G, virginiamycin M1 and virginiamycin S1), we developed a sensitive LC-MS/MS method. The residues were extracted from distillers grains with a mixture of acetonitrile and buffer followed by acetonitrile. The combined extract was diluted with water and washed with hexane. An aliquot was cleaned up on an Oasis HLB solid phase extraction cartridge. Extracts were analyzed by LC-tandem mass spectrometry. The method was successfully validated using a variety of different matrices such as corn DG, corn & milo DG, and deoiled corn DG. Absolute recoveries of the analytes ranged from 53 to 106%. Accuracy ranged from 90 to 101% based on calibration by matrix standards. The limits of quantitation and relative standard deviation were all satisfactory to support future surveillance studies.
