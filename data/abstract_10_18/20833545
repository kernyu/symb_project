Novel bottromycin derivatives were synthesized from bottromycin A(2) via a hydrazide derivative as a common intermediate. Seventeen derivatives were subjected to in vitro evaluation against drug-resistant gram-positive bacteria. Some compounds showed potent anti-MRSA and anti-VRE activity, as did bottromycin A(2). Notably, a propyl ketone derivative exhibited good antibacterial activity with excellent metabolite stability.
