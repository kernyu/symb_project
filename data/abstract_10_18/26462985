OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were: to examine trends in the use of prescription antibiotics overall and by population subgroups between 1999 and 2012; and to examine trends in the use of categories of antibiotics and individual antibiotics. METHODS: Use of antibiotics was examined among 71 444 participants in the nationally representative National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES; 1999-2012). Use of an antibiotic in the past 30 days was the main outcome variable. Analyses of trends were conducted overall and separately by population subgroups (i.e. age, sex, race/Hispanic origin, health insurance status and respiratory conditions) across four time periods (1999-2002, 2003-06, 2007-10 and 2011-12). RESULTS: The percentage of the US population that used a prescription antibiotic in the past 30 days significantly declined from 6.1% in 1999-2002 to 4.1% in 2011-12 (P < 0.001). Declines were also identified for five age groups (0-1 year, 6-11 years, 12-17 years, 18-39 years and 40-59 years), both sexes, non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black persons, persons with and without insurance and among those who currently had asthma. Significant declines were also observed for three categories of antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins and macrolide derivatives). Of the most common antibiotics prescribed, only amoxicillin use decreased significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there was a significant decline in the use of antibiotics between 1999-2002 and 2011-12. Due to concerns about antimicrobial resistance, it is important to continue monitoring the use of antibiotics.
