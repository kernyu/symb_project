We evaluated the resistance to complement-mediated killing of a collection of isogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains expressing different antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. Only the nfxB mutant demonstrated increased susceptibility to complement compared with that for the wild-type strain. This increment was due to the overexpression of MexCD-OprJ, which led to increased C3 opsonization and a reduced ability to infect the lungs of mice. Our results show that the acquisition of antibiotic resistance may alter the interplay of P. aeruginosa with the host immune system.
