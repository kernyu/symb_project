Sonodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy (SACT) is a novel modality, which uses ultrasound to kill bacteria by the activation of molecules termed sonosensitisers (SS) to produce reactive oxygen species that are toxic to microorganism although microbial resistance to this modality has been reported. There are a growing number of SS being reported with the dual ability to be activated by both ultrasound and light, and we hypothesis that a novel antimicrobial strategy, potentially known as sonophotodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy (SPACT), could be developed based on these agents. SPACT offers advantages over SACT and could constitute a new weapon in the fight against the growing global threat posed by microbial infections.
