Multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria are an important issue in intensive care units worldwide. Colistin, one of the earliest polymyxin antibiotics, was once widely used for the treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections. However, its use is now limited due to concerns over nephrotoxicity. The appearance of multidrug-resistant species, including A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa, has led to the re-emergence of this class of drugs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the susceptibility of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa isolates to colistin and other antibiotics. The antimicrobial susceptibility of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa isolates to colistin and other antibiotics was evaluated between January 2011 and October 2012 at Tepecik Education and Research Hospital in Izmir, Turkey. Clinical isolates were identified using an automatized Vitek 2.0 system. Colistin susceptibility was measured by E-test; the susceptibility profiles of other antibiotics were evaluated using the Kirby Bauer disk-diffusion method. A total of 149 isolates were included in the study, consisting of 98 A. baumannii and 51 P. aeruginosa isolates. The MICs of colistin against A. baumannii were 0.125-2.0 mcg/mL, and 0.25-2.0 mcg/mL against P. aeruginosa; all multidrug-resistant strains examined in this study were susceptible to colistin. Recently, colistin has re-emerged as an effective treatment for infections due to multidrug-resistant A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. All isolates examined in this study were susceptible to colistin, suggesting it could be a viable alternative for the treatment of infections with multidrug-resistant strains.
