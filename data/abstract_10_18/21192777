Although carbapenem antibiotics are one of the most effective agents in the treatment of nosocomial infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria, their use is threatened by the emergence of antibiotic resistance. The bacterial resistance to carbapenems parallels their increasing use and has dramatic clinical implications such as increase in mortality and cost of care. This article reviews recently published patents claiming for carbapenem antibacterial agents. New forms including crystalline forms with high oral bioavailability and modified spectrum including methicillin-resistant Staphylococci are some of new patents described in this review.
