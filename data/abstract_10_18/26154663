Antibiotic resistance remains a major health threat and the overuse of antimicrobials contributes to this serious problem. Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) are effective in decreasing the inappropriate use of antimicrobials. The development of pediatric ASPs is increasing and these programs have proven effective in optimizing antimicrobial use in children. The value of ASPs is gaining recognition and the expansion of stewardship into additional health care settings is expected. Collaborative efforts are underway among pediatric ASPs to enhance best practices and develop efficient and effective strategies to minimize unnecessary antimicrobial use in children.
