The horizontal transmission of methicillin resistance to Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in hospital and community settings, and growing prevalence of these strains, presents a significant clinical challenge to the management of serious infections worldwide. While infection control initiatives have stemmed the rising prevalence, MRSA remains a significant pathogen. More recently, evidence that MRSA is becoming resistant to glycopeptides and newer therapies raises concern about the use of these therapies in clinical practice. Vancomycin resistance has become evident in select clinical settings through rising MICs, growing awareness of heteroresistance, and emergence of intermediate-resistant and fully resistant strains. While resistance to linezolid and daptomycin remains low overall, point mutations leading to resistance have been described for linezolid, and horizontal transmission of cfr-mediated resistance to linezolid has been reported in clinical isolates. These resistance trends for newer therapies highlight the ongoing need for new and more potent antimicrobial therapies.
