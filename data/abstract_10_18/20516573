Plans are outlined for a new database for hepatitis antiviral drug resistance mutations that will be closely linked to existing sequence databases. The new database will contain an infrastructure to store all available information on drug resistance mutations for the virus and a mutation can be searched by itself or in conjunction with the sequence information. Self-maintaining and self-updating sequence databases already exist for several viruses. The resistance mutation database would be annotated by authorized users, recruited from among clinicians and researchers familiar with each virus. The new database would provide a central location to find known drug resistance mutations for HBV and HCV; the ability to search the sequence database for each (combination of) mutations, retrieve alignments of relevant sections, and analyse mutation context and other background information; and rapid inclusion of newly found mutations without the need to wait for a publication.
