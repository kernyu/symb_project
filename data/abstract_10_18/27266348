OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical features of Escherichia coli bloodstream infection. METHODS: The clinical data of underlying diseases, antimicrobial susceptibility, temperature at blood sampling, results of routine blood tests, venous catheterization, therapy and prognosis of Escherichia coli bloodstream infection in the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from January 2007 to December 2014 were analyzed retrospectively. The pathogens were routinely isolated and identified. Susceptibilities against antimicrobial agents were determined by Kirby-Bauer methods. RESULTS: All patients had at least one underlying disease. Most of the basic diseases were hematological malignancies, malignant solid tumors, pneumonia and so on. Body temperature was normal in 40 patients (6.4%), fever in 587 patients (93.5%) and low temperature in 1 patient. There were 252 patients with leukopenia (40.1%), 237 patients with granulocytopenia (37.7%) and 216 patients with agranulocytosis. The resistance rate to imipenem was 3.3%, which was the lowest among the total antimicrobial susceptibilities of 628 Escherichia Coli. The extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains accounted for 53.8% among the total patients. The resistance rates of ESBLs-producing-Escherichia coli for the Sulfamethoxazole, Ampicillin, Gentamicin, Cefazolin, Cefuroxime, Cefotaxime, Ceftriaxone, Cefepime, Ceftazidime, Cefoperazone, Piperacillin and Ciprofloxacin were 80.2%, 100.0%, 62.4%, 99.1%, 99.1%, 98.8%, 98.2%, 48.5%, 50.6%, 95.0%, 98.2%, 79.6%, respectively, which were higher than that of non-ESBLs-producing-Escherichia coli (67.9%, 79.7%, 47.6%, 50.0%, 47.2%, 41.0%, 40.3%, 27.2%, 24.1%, 40.0%, 56.2%, 58.3%, respectively), the differences were significant statistically (chi(2)=12.33, 75.90, 13.92, 209.00, 224.94, 259.25, 256.59, 27.79, 46.19, 222.85, 165.08, 33.59, all P<0.05). One hundred and seventy eight patients received venous catheterization when blood culture were performed. All the patients received antimicrobial treatment, mainly including carbapenem antibiotics and beta-lactamase inhibitors combinations. Of which 533 patients were improved, the improvement rate was 84.9%. CONCLUSIONS: There are many risk factors in relation to Escherichia coli bloodstream infection. The antimicrobial resistance rate of ESBLs-producing-Escherichia coli is higher than that of none-ESBLs-producing-Escherichia coli. Individualized strategies should be based on antimicrobial sensitivity.
