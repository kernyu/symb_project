A novel metallo-beta-lactamase, NDM-8, was identified in a multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli isolate, IOMTU11 (NCGM37), obtained from the respiratory tract of a patient in Nepal. The amino acid sequence of NDM-8 has substitutions at positions 130 (Asp to Gly) and 154 (Met to Leu) compared with NDM-1. NDM-8 showed enzymatic activities against beta-lactams similar to those of NDM-1.
