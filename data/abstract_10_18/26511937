The aim of this work was to study the potential of delivering clindamycin phosphate, as an efficient antibiotic drug, into a more absorbed, elastic ultradeformable form, transfersomes (TRSs). These vesicles showed an enhanced penetration through ex vivo permeation characters. TRSs were prepared using thin-film hydration method. Furthermore, they were evaluated for their entrapment efficiency, size, zeta potential, and morphology. Also, the prepared TRSs were converted into suitable gel formulation using carbopol 934 and were evaluated for their gel characteristics like pH, viscosity, spreadability, homogeneity, skin irritation, in vitro release, stability, and ex vivo permeation studies in rats. TRSs were efficiently formulated in a stable bilayer vesicle structure. Furthermore, clindamycin phosphate showed higher entrapment efficiency within the TRSs reaching about 93.3% +/- 0.8 and has a uniform particle size. Moreover, the TRSs surface had a high negative charge which indicated the stability of the produced vesicles and resistance of aggregation. Clindamycin phosphate showed a significantly higher in vitro release (p < 0.05; ANOVA/Tukey) compared with the control carbopol gel. Furthermore, the transfersomal gel showed a significantly higher (p < 0.05; ANOVA/Tukey) cumulative amount of drug permeation and flux than both the transfersomal suspension and the control carbopol gel. In conclusion, the produced results suggest that TRS-loaded clindamycin are promising carriers for enhanced dermal delivery of clindamycin phosphate.
