Twelve non-replicate Acinetobacter baumannii isolates from five European hospitals, Kuwait, and the US military healthcare system collected between 1980 and 2005 revealed a new clone, CC32. These included representative isolates of outbreaks/cross-infections. Antimicrobial susceptibility and carbapenem-resistant genetic traits varied. The widespread occurrence, the association with an outbreak and the carbapenem resistance indicate that CC32 has epidemic potential.
