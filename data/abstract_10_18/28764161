Providencia rettgeri (P. rettgeri) is an ubiquitous organism but is seldom associated with human disease. We report the isolation of P. rettgeri from the urine sample of a 39-year-old male patient on prolonged Foley's catheterisation following a severe head injury. Identification of this organism was done by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) based systems. P. rettgeri is an emerging pathogen among long term catheterised patients. It reflects its ability to form biofilm on the surface of the indwelling catheter as well as the inherent urease producing property of the pathogen in question as a possible mechanism of pathogenesis.
