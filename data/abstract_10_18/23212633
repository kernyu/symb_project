A new triterpenoid, named alisol Q 23-acetate, as well as fourteen known terpenes, alisol B 23-acetate (2), alisol B (3), alismol (4), 10-O-methyl-alismoxide (5), alismoxide (6), 11-deoxyalisol C (7), 13beta,17beta-epoxyalisol B 23-acetate (8), 4beta,12-dihydroxyguaian-6,10-diene (9), alisol C 23-acetate (10), alisolide (11), 16beta-methoxyalisol B monoacetate (12), alisol A (13), 16beta-hydroxyalisol B 23-acetate (14), alisol A 24-acetate (15) were isolated from the rhizomes of Alisma orientale. The structures of compounds (1-15) were identified based on 1D and 2D NMR, including (1)H-(1)H COSY, HSQC, HMBC and NOESY spectroscopic analyses. Among these isolates, antibacterial effect of compounds 2, 3, 10, and 15, major constituents of A. orientale was examined. The MIC values of compounds 2, 10, and 15 were 5-10 betag/mL against eight antibiotic resistant strains, which were lower than those from the positive controls (MICs of chloramphenicol and ampicillin were 5-80 mug/mL). Therefore, compounds 2, 10 and 15 exhibited the potent antibacterial activity.
