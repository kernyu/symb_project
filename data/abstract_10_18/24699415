The transcription factor nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) regulates multiple antioxidants, Phase II detoxification enzymes and other cytoprotective enzymes in cells. Activation of Nrf2 is recognised as being of potential therapeutic benefit in inflammatory-diseases whereas more recently, it has become clear that the inhibition of Nrf2 may have benefit in the alleviation of resistance in some tumour types. A potential G-quadruplex forming sequence was identified in the promoter region of Nrf2, close to a number of putative transcription factor binding sites. Characterisation of the sequence 5'-d[GGGAAGGGAGCAAGGGCGGGAGGG]-3' using CD spectroscopy, imino proton NMR resonances and UV melting experiments demonstrated the formation of a parallel intramolecular G-quadruplex in the presence of K(+) ions. Incubation with 9-aminoacridine ligands induced a switch from antiparallel to parallel forms. The presence of a G-quadruplex forming sequence in the promoter region of Nrf2 suggests an approach to targeting the production of the protein through stabilisation of the structure, thereby avoiding resistance to antitumour drugs.
