PURPOSE: To report the use of hyperdried cross-linked (HDCL) amniotic membrane (AM) patching with tissue adhesive as an initial therapy for corneal perforations. METHODS: Cryopreserved AM was cross-linked with 0.1% glutaraldehyde and then dried using far-infrared rays and microwaves (hyperdry method). Three eyes of three patients with corneal perforations of up to 3 mm in diameter were included in this study. They were treated with a single-layer patch of HDCL-AM applied with a tissue adhesive (2-octyl-cyanoacrylate). We also evaluated the resistance of HDCL-AM to collagenases during in vitro digestion testing. RESULTS: In all three cases, the corneal perforations were repaired within 28 days (range, 17-28 days). No recurrence occurred during the follow-up period (3-6 months). In the collagenase digestion testing, the HDCL-AM did not dissolve until 48 h, whereas the cryopreserved AM completely dissolved within 60 min. CONCLUSIONS: Three cases of corneal perforations were successfully managed using HDCL-AM patching with tissue adhesive. The HDCL-AM was resistant to collagenases during in vitro digestion testing. The HDCL-AM was a useful substrate for corneal perforations. This simple surgical technique may be one of the initial therapeutic options for corneal perforations.
