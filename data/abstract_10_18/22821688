Bacterial biofilms are ubiquitous in nature, industry, and medicine, and understanding their development and cellular structure is critical in controlling the unwanted consequences of biofilm growth. Here, we report the ultrastructure of a novel bacterial form observed by scanning electron microscopy in the luminal vegetations of catheters from patients with active Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. This novel structure had the general appearance of a normal staphylococcal cell but up to 10 to 15 times as large. Transmission electron microscopy indicated that these structures appeared as sacs enclosing multiple normal-sized (~0.6 microm) staphylococcal forms. Using in vitro cultivated biofilms, cytochemical studies using fluorescent reagents revealed that these structures were rich in lipids and appeared within 15 min after S. aureus inoculation onto clinically relevant abiotic surfaces. Because they appeared early in biofilm development, these novel bacterial forms may represent an unappreciated mechanism for biofilm surface adherence, and their prominent lipid expression levels could explain the perplexing increased antimicrobial resistance of biofilm-associated bacteria.
