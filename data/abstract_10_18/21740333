OBJECTIVE: Antimicrobial resistance is one of the biggest problem in medicine at the beginning of the third millennium. Antibiotic resistance is frequently associated with significant morbidity, longer hospitalization, excess costs and mortality. METHODS: In this work we discussed the role of clinical microbiology laboratory as an essential part for an effective infection control program, especially in management and treatment of "difficult infections". RESULTS: At present time, laboratory personnel have a broad range of new technologies that they can use to support and enhance the efforts of the infection control staff. In addition a network of established experts in the determination of antimicrobial breakpoints and in antimicrobial susceptibility testing has been constituted in Europe under the auspices of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). CONCLUSION: Qualified personnel and new strategies to overcome drug resistance can contribute to solve the microbial infections problems.
