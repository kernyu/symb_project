To highlight the global need for effective antibiotics and explore possible concerted actions for change, cross-cutting plenary sessions served to frame the program of the conference. These sessions contained presentations on the present state of antibacterial resistance and the availability, the use and misuse of antibiotics. A number of possible actions were discussed, such as rational use of and access to antibiotics from various perspectives. The roles of vaccines and diagnostics were touched upon and followed by in depth discussions on supply-side bottlenecks with their scientific, regulatory and financial challenges. The value chain for research and development (R&D) of antibiotics has to be reengineered if we are to realize the development of much needed new antibiotics. This challenge will require a multitude of actions, some of which are related to changing the financial realities of antibiotics and interventions by global and regional institutions.
