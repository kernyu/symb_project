Drug-resistant cytomegalovirus appears during prolonged anti-cytomegalovirus therapy. Assays for human cytomegalovirus viral protein kinase (UL97) and viral DNA polymerase (UL54) gene mutations conferring drug resistance have been used rather than susceptibility assays to assess clinical specimens. In this study a sensitive system for genotype assay of UL97 and UL54 in clinical specimens with as few as six copies/microg of DNA was developed.
