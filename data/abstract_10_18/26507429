The emergence of MDR-TB is a cause of great concern due to difficulties in patient management and poor treatment outcomes. Currently the duration of treatment and the choice of drugs for patients with MDR-TB are standardized in many countries. This might not be the best approach since the optimal therapy may depend on different pathogen- and host-related features. Combining the introduction of technological innovations such as whole bacillary genome sequencing for the identification of drug-resistance-associated mutations, therapeutic drug monitoring and host-directed therapies with an individualized approach to MDR-TB management will likely lead to more tolerable, shorter and more efficient treatment regimens and an increase in the quality of life of those affected by MDR-TB.
