HIV type-1 (HIV-1) non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are key drugs of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the clinical management of AIDS/HIV infection. NNRTI-based HAART regimes effectively suppress viral reproduction, are not cytotoxic and show favourable pharmacokinetic properties. First-generation NNRTIs suffer the rapid selection of viral variants, hampering the binding of inhibitors into the reverse transcriptase (RT) non-nucleoside binding site (NNBS). Efforts to improve these first inhibitors led to the discovery of second-generation NNRTIs that proved to be effective against the drug-resistant mutant HIV-1 strains. The success of such agents launched a new season of NNRTI design and synthesis. This paper reviews the characteristics of second-generation NNRTIs, including etravirine, rilpivirine, RDEA-806, UK-453061, BIRL 355 BS, IDX 899, MK-4965 and HBY 097. In particular, the binding modes of these inhibitors into the NNBS of the HIV-1 RT and the most clinically relevant mutant RTs are analysed and discussed.
