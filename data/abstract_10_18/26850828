The emergence of infections by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria, which is accompanied by considerable mortality due to inappropriate therapy, led to the investigation of whether adjunctive treatment with one polyclonal IgM-enriched immunoglobulin preparation (IgGAM) would improve outcomes. One hundred patients in Greece with microbiologically confirmed severe infections by MDR Gram-negative bacteria acquired after admission to the Intensive Care Unit and treated with IgGAM were retrospectively analysed from a large prospective multicentre cohort. A similar number of patient comparators well-matched for stage of sepsis, source of infection, appropriateness of antimicrobials and co-morbidities coming from the same cohort were selected. All-cause 28-day mortality was the primary end point; mortality by extensively drug-resistant (XDR) pathogens and time to breakthrough bacteraemia were the secondary end points. Fifty-eight of the comparators and 39 of the IgGAM-treated cases died by day 28 (p 0.011). The OR for death under IgGAM treatment was 0.46 (95% CI 0.26-0.85). Stepwise regression analysis revealed that IgGAM was associated with favourable outcome whereas acute coagulopathy, cardiovascular failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic renal disease were associated with unfavourable outcome. Thirty-nine of 62 comparators (62.9%) were infected by XDR Gram-negative bacteria and died by day 28 compared with 25 of 65 cases treated with IgGAM (38.5%) (p 0.008). Median times to breakthrough bacteraemia were 4 days and 10 days, respectively (p <0.0001). Results favour the use of IgGAM as an adjunct to antimicrobial treatment for the management of septic shock caused by MDR Gram-negative bacteria. A prospective randomized trial is warranted.
