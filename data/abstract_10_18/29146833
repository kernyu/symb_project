Here, we present the draft genome sequences of eight streptogramin-resistant Enterococcus species isolated from animals and an environmental source in the United States from 2001 to 2004. Antimicrobial resistance genes were identified conferring resistance to the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramins, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, beta-lactams, and glycopeptides.
