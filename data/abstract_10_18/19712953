Instead of relying on drugs to reduce the parasite burden of leishmaniasis, and waiting for the effector immune response to develop in time to control the parasites, immunotherapy in conjunction with chemotherapy can rapidly induce the effector immune response. With a safe and potent drug plus an affordable therapeutic vaccine (immunostimulant), which remains to be developed, a single visit by patients with visceral or cutaneous leishmaniasis might be sufficient to induce a quick and lasting recovery. Drug toxicity and the emergence of resistance could also be dramatically reduced compared with present long-term monotherapy. Immunotherapy could be an effective addition to chemotherapy for leishmaniasis.
