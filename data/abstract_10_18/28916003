We here report the occurrence of S. aureus in wild boars and characterize isolates genotypically and phenotypically in order to get knowledge about the occurrence of clonal lineages and genotypes in free-living wild animals. Forty-one S. aureus isolates obtained from 111 wild boars hunted in Lower Saxony, Germany, were investigated and compared to human and livestock isolates. The S. aureus belonged to multilocus sequence types ST1, ST7, ST30, ST133, ST425, ST804, ST890 and to the new ST3237, ST3238, ST3255 and ST3369. The livestock associated CC398-MRSA lineage, however, was not found. In addition to well-known spa types, the new types t14999, t15000, t15001 and t15002 were detected. Macrorestriction analysis revealed a variety of different SmaI fragment patterns. Most isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobials tested, including methicillin, and resistance was detected only to ampicillin, penicillin and erythromycin. PCR analysis confirmed the presence of staphylococcal enterotoxin genes (seh) in all t127-ST1 isolates. A high degree of genetic diversity was detected with many spa types and clonal lineages previously reported in humans and livestock animals.
