The Alliance to Save our Antibiotics, which is made up of the Soil Association, Sustain and Compassion in World Farming, held a meeting in London recently to discuss issues surrounding the use of antibiotics on farms. Before the meeting, Jan Dahl, chief adviser to the Danish Agriculture and Food Council, spoke to Veterinary Record about the regulation of antimicrobial use in food-producing animals in Denmark, and the possibility of a similar system working in the UK.
