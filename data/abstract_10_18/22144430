Tanzania implemented artemether-lumefantrine (AL) as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in November of 2006 because of resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. AL remains highly efficacious, but widespread use may soon facilitate emergence of artemisinin tolerance/resistance, which initially may be detected at the molecular level as temporal changes in the frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Pfmdr-1 gene associated with AL resistance. In Tanzania, 830 Plasmodium falciparum-positive samples collected between 2003 and 2010 were examined for SNPs of Pfmdr-1 at codons 86, 184, and 1246. Both the N86 and 184F increased from 2006 to 2010 (logistic regression; N86: odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 1.35 [1.07-1.71], P = 0.01; 184F: odds ratio = 1.42 [1.07-1.88], P = 0.02), and no change was found for D1246 (odds ratio = 1.01 [0.80-1.28], P = 0.9). The observed changes may be because of introduction of AL, and if so, this finding gives cause for concern and argues for continued surveillance of these molecular markers.
