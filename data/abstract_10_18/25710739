The design, synthesis, and SAR studies of novel inhibitors of HCV NS4B based on the imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole scaffold were described. Optimization of potency with respect to genotype 1b resulted in the discovery of two potent leads 26f (EC50 = 16 nM) and 28g (EC50 = 31 nM). The resistance profile studies revealed that 26f and 28g targeted HCV NS4B, more precisely the second amphipathic alpha helix of NS4B (4BAH2). Cross-resistance between our 4BAH2 inhibitors and other direct-acting antiviral agents targeting NS3/4A, NS5A, and NS5B was not observed. For the first time, the synergism of a series of combinations based on 4BAH2 inhibitors was evaluated. The results demonstrated that our 4BAH2 inhibitor 26f was synergistic with NS3/4A inhibitor simeprevir, NS5A inhibitor daclatasvir, and NS5B inhibitor sofosbuvir, and it could also reduce the dose of these drugs at almost all effect levels. Our study suggested that favorable effects could be achieved by combining 4BAH2 inhibitors such as 26f with these approved drugs and that new all-oral antiviral combinations based on 4BAH2 inhibitors were worth developing to supplement or even replace current treatment regimens for curing HCV infection.
