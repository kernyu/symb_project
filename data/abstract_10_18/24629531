Antimicrobial resistance towards antibiotics is an increasing issue for the international society. A Cochrane meta-analysis regarding procalcitonin (PCT) as guidance for initiating and discontinuation of antibiotic treatment in respiratory tract infections in a total of 4,221 patients in various care settings has shown promising results for guiding treatment with a PCT cut-off of 0.25 ng/ml, although more research is needed to clarify possible risks to the approach, especially in intensive care units.
