AIM: Characterize persistence properties and antibiotic sensitivity of Corynebacterium non diphtheriae circulating in Rostov-on-Don and Rostov Region. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNase, anti-immunoglobulin activity, hemagglutinating activity, antagonistic properties and antibiotic sensitivity of Corynebacterium non diphtheriae strains isolated from patients with inflammatory diseases of urogenital tract, pregnant women and individuals undertaking prophylactic examination were studied. RESULTS: Lack of antagonistic interactions of C. non diphtheriae with members of opportunistic microorganisms, high anti-immunoglobulin activity against IgM and IgA, lack of hemagglutinating activity were established. Cefazolin and benzylpenicillin had the highest antibacterial activity against C. non diphtheriae, azithromycin and lincomycin--the lowest. CONCLUSION: Population level of C. non diphtheriae during urogenital tract disease diagnostics is necessary. Determination of their sensitivity to a wide specter of antibacterial preparations is reasonable for optimal selection of therapeutic agents.
