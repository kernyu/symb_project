Compared to culture-based method, the sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values of the GenoType((R)) HelicoDR for detecting Helicobacter pylori resistance were, respectively, 100, 86.2, 89.7%, and 100% to clarithromycin as well as 82.6, 95.1, 90.5%, and 90.7% to fluoroquinolones. This molecular assay detected a mixture of genotypes and could successfully analyze biopsies without transport/storage limitations.
