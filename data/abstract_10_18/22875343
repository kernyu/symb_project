Delocalized lipophilic cations, such as dequalinium (DQA), selectively accumulate in mitochondria and display anticancer activity in cells from different malignancies. Previous studies in K562 human leukemic cells indicate that DQA causes cell damage as a consequence of an early disturbance in the mitochondrial function, inducing oxidative stress. These cells turned out to be resistant to apoptosis and died by necrosis when treated with high DQA concentrations (20 mumol/L) for long time periods (48 h). Resistance of K562 cells to DQA-induced apoptosis could be eliminated by inhibition of the kinase activity of the Bcr-Abl protein with imatinib. In this paper, we have studied the effect of DQA on the Raf/MEK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signal transduction pathways in K562 cells. Our data suggest a DQA downregulatory activity on both ERK1/2 and PI3K protein kinase activity supporting an interaction between both proteins. Moreover, inhibition of ERK1/2 with U0126 enhanced the ability of DQA to potentiate imatinib-induced apoptosis, suggesting a role of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway and the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase in the K562 cell survival. This study contributes to a better understanding of the action mechanism of DQA on K562 cells and encourages the study of DQA in combination with other agents for improving the efficacy of targeted therapies and overcoming resistance to chemotherapeutic agents.
