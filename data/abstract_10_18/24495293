Treatment adherence is generally regarded as an important factor in achieving optimal outcomes across many disease states; in the treatment of HIV, poor adherence to treatment has the potential to impact outcomes on multiple levels. Poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is associated with less effective viral suppression, which risks the immediate health of the patient, but also risks creating permanent treatment resistance to that particular agent or group of agents within a given combination therapy regimen. This may have downstream effects on treatment costs as well as therapeutic options. The causes of poor adherence to ART are extremely diverse, and include complexity of therapeutic regimens (eg, pill burden and dosing frequency), treatment side effects, poor health literacy, poor patient-physician relationship, and limited access to ART as a result of formulary restrictions or copayment costs. Treatment approaches, such as the use of fixed-dose combinations of ART agents to reduce dosing complexity, as well as educational interventions, such as medication therapy management initiatives, have been shown to improve adherence to therapy in HIV. It is important that all members of the healthcare team address potential barriers to adherence in order to achieve viral suppression and optimize outcomes in patients with HIV.
