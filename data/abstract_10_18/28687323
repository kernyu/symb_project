The present study is aimed to assess the role of glutathione S-transferase (GST) in antibiotic resistance among the bacteria isolated from the poultry litter and to identify the effect of GST to reduce the antimicrobial activity of antibiotics. Induction of various antibiotics to Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Micrococcus sp. isolated from the poultry litter showed that the activity of GST was three to four folds higher than those of control. Analysis of the isozyme pattern of GST revealed that variation in the expression may be due to antibiotic resistance. The results concluded that GST might play an important role in the protection against the toxic effect of the antimicrobial agents which leads bacteria to become resistant to antibiotics.
