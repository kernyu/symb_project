Fluorine-containing nucleoside analogs (NAs) represent a significant class of the US FDA-approved chemotherapeutics widely used in the clinic. The incorporation of fluorine into drug-like agents modulates lipophilic, electronic and steric parameters, thus influencing pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of drugs. Fluorine can block oxidative metabolism of drugs and the formation of undesired metabolites by changing H-bonding interactions. In this review, we focus our attention on chemical fluorination reagents and methods used in the NAs field, including positron emission tomography radiochemistry. We briefly discuss both the cellular biology and clinical properties of FDA-approved and fluorine-containing nucleoside/nucleotide analogs in development as well as common resistance mechanisms associated with their use. Finally, we emphasize pronucleotide strategies used to improve therapeutic outcome of NAs in the clinic.
