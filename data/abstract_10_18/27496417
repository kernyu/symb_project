BACKGROUND: Blood infections with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative carbapenem-resistant bacilli are particularly dangerous and challenging to treat in organ transplant recipients. Resistance to carbapenems may be acquired, for example, in Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas, or Acinetobacter spp. or innate, for example, in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The purpose of this study was to analyze blood infections caused by S maltophilia in organ transplant recipients and to compare drug susceptibility of these bacteria and the same species isolated from the blood of other inpatients. METHODS: A total of 26 S maltophilia strains isolated from blood samples of 26 patients (including 14 liver or kidney transplant recipients) hospitalized during 2011 to 2014 were evaluated in this study. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined via E-test and disk diffusion methods. RESULTS: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains isolated from blood exhibited sensitivity to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (100%), levofloxacin (96.2%), ciprofloxacin (92.3%), ticarcillin/clavulanic acid (80.8%), and ceftazidime (53.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Because appropriate antibiotic therapy in the case of S maltophilia differs from the standard empirical therapy administered in the case of most other Gram-negative bacilli, early identification of this pathogen is of particular significance. The use of antibiotics to which this pathogen is sensitive eliminates the infection and helps avoid graft loss.
