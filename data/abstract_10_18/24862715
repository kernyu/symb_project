INTRODUCTION: Vertical root fracture is a common finding in endodontically treated teeth, notably oval roots. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of instrumentation kinematics and the material of instrument construction of single-file systems on dentin walls and fracture resistance of oval roots. METHODS: Sixty-five roots with oval canals were allocated into a control group (n = 5) and 3 experimental groups of 20 roots each. Group WO was instrumented with the WaveOne primary file (Dentsply Maillefer, Baillagues, Switzerland), group PT-Rec was prepared with F2 ProTaper files (Dentsply Maillefer, Baillagues, Switzerland) used in a reciprocating motion, and group PT-Rot was prepared with F2 ProTaper files used in a rotation motion. For crack evaluation, half of the samples (n = 30) were embedded in acrylic resin, and the blocks were sectioned at 3, 6, and 9 mm from the apex. The sections were examined under a stereomicroscope and scored for crack presence. The other half of the specimens (n = 30) were obturated using lateral condensation of gutta-percha and AdSeal sealer (Meta Biomed Co, Ltd, Chungbuk, Korea). The specimens were then subjected to a load of 1 mm/min to determine the force required to fracture the roots. RESULTS: WaveOne instruments induced the least amount of cracks and exhibited greatest resistance to fracture compared with ProTaper F2 files whether used in reciprocating or rotating motions. CONCLUSIONS: The alloy from which the material is manufactured is a more important factor determining the dentin damaging potential of single-file instruments than the motion of instrumentation.
