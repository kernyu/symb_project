BACKGROUND: Selenoprotein S (SelS) is an important endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane-located selenoprotein implicated in inflammatory responses and insulin resistance. However, the effects of SelS on endothelial cells (ECs) have not been reported. In the present study, the role of SelS in oxidative stress and the underlying mechanism were investigated in human ECs. METHODS: A SelS over-expression plasmid (pc-SelS) and a SelS-siRNA plasmid were transfected into human umbilical vein endothelial cells (American Type Culture Collection, USA). The cells were divided into four groups: control, SelS over-expression (transfected with pc-SelS), vector control, and SelS knockdown (transfected with siRNA-SelS). After treating the cells with H2O2, the effects of oxidative stress and the expression of caveolin-1 (Cav-1) and protein kinase Calpha (PKCalpha) were investigated. RESULTS: Following treatment with H2O2, over-expression of SelS significantly increased cell viability and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) production and Cav-1 gene and protein expression. However, no effects on PKCalpha were observed. In contrast, knockdown of SelS significantly decreased cell viability, SOD activity, and PKCalpha gene and protein expression, and increased MDA production and Cav-1 gene and protein expression. CONCLUSIONS: SelS protects ECs from oxidative stress by inhibiting the expression of Cav-1 and PKCalpha.
