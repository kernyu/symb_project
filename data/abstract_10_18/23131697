BACKGROUND: Mycophenolic acid (MPA) exposure in pediatric patients with kidney transplant receiving body surface area (BSA)-based dosing exhibits large variability. Several genetic variants in glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) and of multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) have independently been suggested to predict MPA exposure in adult patients with varying results. Here, the combined contribution of these genetic variants to MPA pharmacokinetic variability was investigated in pediatric renal transplant recipients who were on mycophenolic mofetil maintenance therapy. METHODS: MPA and MPA-glucuronide concentrations from 32 patients were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography. MPA exposure (AUC) was estimated using a 4-point abbreviated sampling strategy (predose/trough and 20 minutes, 1 hour, and 3 hours after dose) using a validated pediatric Bayesian estimator. Genotyping was performed for all of the following single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): UGT1A8 830G>A(*3), UGT1A9 98T>C(*3), UGT1A9-440C>T, UGT1A9-2152C>T, UGT1A9-275T>A, UGT2B7-900A>G, and MRP2-24T>C. RESULTS: Recipients heterozygous for MRP2-24T>C who also had UGT1A9-440C>T or UGT2B7-900A>G (n = 4), and MRP2-24T>C-negative recipients having both UGT1A9-440C>T and UGT2B7-900A>G (n = 5) showed a 2.2 and 1.7 times higher dose-dependent and BSA-normalized MPA-AUC compared with carriers of no or only 1 UGT-SNP (P < 0.001 and P = 0.01, respectively) (n = 7). Dose-dependent and BSA-normalized predose MPA concentrations were 3.0 and 2.4 times higher, respectively (P < 0.001). Interindividual variability in peak concentrations could be explained by the presence of the UGT1A9-440C>T genotype (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our preliminary study demonstrates that combined UGT1A9-440C>T, UGT2B7-900A>G, and MRP2-24T>C polymorphisms can be important predictors of interindividual variability in MPA exposure in the pediatric population.
