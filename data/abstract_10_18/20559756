There have been no new antituberculous drugs since the introduction of rifampin in 1952. The collision of the HIV and tuberculosis (TB) epidemics in developing regions of the world together with the emergence of multidrug resistance and extensively drug-resistant strains of TB has emphasized the urgent need for newer antituberculous drugs. There is a need for drugs that are safe, effective against resistant strains, are able to shorten the course of treatment, are effective for latent TB infection, and that have minimal interactions with antiretroviral drugs. Drugs that are currently in phase 3 development are moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin. In phase 2 development are PA-824 and TMC207; and in phase 1 are SQ109, AZD5847, and linezolid. Nanotechnology holds future promise for targeted drug delivery. Immunotherapy such as new vaccines and vitamin D may serve as adjunctive treatment for prevention and active disease, together with shortening the course of treatment. Bringing newer and more effective antituberculous drugs to market is a global priority and the process must be accelerated.
