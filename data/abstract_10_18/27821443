The HIV protease inhibitor lopinavir inhibits Plasmodium falciparum aspartic proteases (plasmepsins) and parasite development, and children receiving lopinavir-ritonavir experienced fewer episodes of malaria than those receiving other antiretroviral regimens. Resistance to lopinavir was selected in vitro over approximately 9 months, with approximately 4-fold decreased sensitivity. Whole-genome sequencing of resistant parasites showed a mutation and increased copy number in pfmdr1 and a mutation in a protein of unknown function, but no polymorphisms in plasmepsin genes.
