Drug resistance in HIV-infected children is one of the main contributors to antiretroviral treatment (ART) failure, especially in developing countries. Sub-Saharan Africa has the largest burden of pediatric HIV infection in the world. Herein, we systematically review the current status of ART failure in HIV-infected African children. A literature search for publications within 10 years was performed through PubMed to identify relevant articles. Included studies examined the impact of timing of ART initiation, criteria for diagnosing therapeutic failure, predictors of therapeutic failure, management strategies and future directions to minimize failure rates in these pediatric populations. Although there is scale-up of ART programs in Africa, novel therapeutic and management strategies are needed to overcome current challenges.
