The lack or absence of social and political interest in the problem of antibiotic resistance, the difficulty in identifying active molecules against new targets, and above all, low profitability in comparison to other types of drugs, as well as uncertainty and the arbitrary nature of regulatory authorities in terms of assessing effectiveness, all contribute to a significant slowdown in the marketing of new antibiotics. Current conditions do not favor investment in new antibiotics by the pharmaceutical industry, which has available therapeutic areas with far greater profit potential, and other problems of its own to handle. Since we cannot force the industry to develop antibiotics, it is necessary to implement policies as soon as possible that stimulate interest in developing them, or find a way for the states and regulatory authorities to replace the pharmaceutical industry in this task.
