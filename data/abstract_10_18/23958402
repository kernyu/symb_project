Data regarding the susceptibility of Conidiobolus lamprauges is limited and there is no consensus about the optimal treatment for infections caused by Conidiobolus spp. In this context, the objective of this study was to evaluate the in vitro susceptibility of six C. lamprauges strains isolated from sheep conidiobolomycosis to amphotericin B, ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, anidulafungin, caspofungin, micafungin, flucytosine, and terbinafine using the CLSI M38-A2 microdilution technique. Terbinafine was the most active (MIC range <0.06-0.5 mug/mL). Resistance or reduced susceptibility was observed for amphotericin B and azole and echinocandin antifungals. Additional studies are necessary to determine the therapeutic potential of terbinafine as monotherapy or in combination therapy with other antifungals.
