The new integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) dolutegravir (DTG) displays limited cross-resistance with older drugs of this class and selects for the R263K substitution in treatment-experienced patients. We performed tissue culture selections with DTG, using viruses resistant to older INSTIs and infectivity and resistance assays, and showed that the presence of the E92Q or N155H substitution was compatible with the emergence of R263K, whereas the G140S Q148R, E92Q N155H, G140S, Y143R, and Q148R substitutions were not.
