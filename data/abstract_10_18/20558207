Macrophages represent an important site for productive infection of HIV-1 and the evaluation of integrase (IN) inhibitors on this cell subset is of fundamental importance. In this report, preclinical evaluation of IN inhibitors on primary human macrophages was attempted successfully using a 96-well microtiter phenotypic assay developed recently for the evaluation of IN inhibitors in a cell-based system by taking advantage of HIV-derived lentiviral vectors expressing luciferase. IN inhibitors were also tested using a lentiviral vector containing an IN with introduced T66I/S153Y mutations, known to affect the activity of azido-group-containing diketo acid (DKA) IN inhibitors. Utilizing different classes of HIV integrase inhibitors against the wild-type IN and the mutant mentioned above, some of the IN inhibitors used were also active on this particular mutant, suggesting that should HIV-1 develop additional or different mutations to become resistant to such anti-IN drugs, new drugs can be developed with a better resistance profile. This assay provides a standardized method for the preclinical evaluation of the efficacy of IN inhibitors on wild-type and mutated IN that can be adapted easily for the evaluation of anti-IN activity on IN sequences derived from patients.
