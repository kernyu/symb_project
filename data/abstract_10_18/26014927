We report the first OXA-181-producing strain in China. blaOXA-181 was found in sequence type 410 (ST410) Escherichia coli strain WCHEC14828 from a Chinese patient without recent travel history. Genome sequencing and conjugation experiments were performed. blaOXA-181 was carried on a 51-kb self-transmissible IncX3 plasmid and was linked with qnrS1, a quinolone resistance gene. blaOXA-181 was introduced onto the IncX3 plasmid from a ColE2-type plasmid, and IncX3 plasmids have the potential to mediate the dissemination of blaOXA-181.
