BACKGROUND: Superimposed infections/sepsis are the major cause of morbidity/mortality in Stevens-Johnson syndrome/Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (SJS/TEN). It is a delicate balance between avoiding new pharmaceuticals and prophylactically treat an incipient infection. The objective of this study was to investigate the rates and types of infection-microbials and antibiotics involved in SJS/TEN patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Microbiology and clinical data were collected for SJS/TEN patients admitted to our Burn Center from January 2010 through January 2016. RESULTS: A total of 24 patients were admitted over the study period. There were 303 bacterial cultures taken whereof 113 (37.3%) were positive (median of 4.4 per patient). Twenty-two (91.7%) patients had at least 1 positive sample recorded. Fifteen (62.5%) patients had a confirmed episode of sepsis with skin being the most common source of colonization (77.8%). Eleven (45.8%) patients received empiric antibiotic therapy at referral facility/prior to admission to our Center. Patients who grew a higher number of different species were significantly less likely to have received early empiric antimicrobial therapy (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Secondary bacterial infection and sepsis were a highly common finding in our patient population. Despite the risk of resistance and further immunological provocation, empirical antibiotic treatment might have a place in clinical management.
