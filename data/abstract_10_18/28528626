Colloidal particles are being extensively studied in various antimicrobial applications due to their small size to volume ratio and ability to exhibit a wide spectrum of antibacterial, antifungal, antialgal and antiviral action. The present review focuses on various nanoparticles (NPs) of inorganic, organic and hybrid materials, and discusses some of the methods for their preparation as well as mechanisms of their antimicrobial action. We consider the antimicrobial applications of metal oxide nanoparticles (ZnO, MgO, CuO, Cu2O, Al2O3, TiO2, CeO2 and Y2O3), metal nanoparticles (NPs), such as copper, silver and gold, metal hydroxide NPs such as Mg(OH)2 as well as hybrid NPs made from biodegradable materials, such as chitosan, lignin and dextran, loaded with other antimicrobial agents. Recent developments for targeted delivery of antimicrobials by using colloid antibodies for microbial cell shape and surface recognition are also discussed. We also consider recent advances in the functionalization of nanoparticles and their potential antimicrobial applications as a viable alternative of conventional antibiotics and antiseptic agents which can help to tackle antimicrobial resistance. The review also covers the recently developed environmentally benign NPs (EbNPs) as a "safer-by-design" green chemistry solution of the post use fate of antimicrobial nanomaterials.
