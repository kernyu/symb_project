Whilst anthelminthic resistance of small strongyles is well documented, anthelmintic failures against infections with Oxyuris equi have scarcely been published so far. We describe two cases of equine oxyurosis and the anthelminthic failure of macrocyclic lactones (moxidectin, ivermectin) resulting in persistent O. equi infections with continuous egg shedding. The horses were kept in two different herds in the federal state of Hessia, Germany. Herd A kept two geldings: an 8-year-old Welsh-Cob-Mix and a 7-year-old Haflinger. Herd B was composed of four animals: 2 Connemara-mares, 31 and 19 years old, one 18-year-old Connemara-gelding and a 27-year-old Norwegian Fjord mare. All animals had a case history of various anthelmintic treatments with macrocyclic lactones (moxidectin and ivermectin alternating irregulary) in 2010 and 2011, nonetheless, they continued to shed O. equi nematodes and eggs. Animals were treated anew with moxidectin by members of the institute and were continuously monitored on a daily base by adhesive tape samples. Follow-up examinations for the reappearance of eggs were performed for 30 days in Herd A and 57 days in Herd B. In total, recurrence of O. equi egg shedding was detected in three out of six horses within 1-4 weeks after treatment. In both herds accompanying horses sharing the same stable and paddock remained negative for detection of O. equi-eggs or worms throughout the whole observation period. This is the first report in Europe showing inefficacy of commercial ivermectin compounds and furthermore the first report at all documenting ineffectiveness of moxidectin compounds in the treatment of O. equi-infections in horses indicating a possible development of resistance or confirming an existing incomplete oxyuricidal efficacy.
