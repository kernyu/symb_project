The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of the bla (SHV) gene in Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from hospital and community infections and from the normal microbiota of healthy individuals in Recife, PE, Brazil. Fifty-two K. pneumoniae isolates were analyzed regarding the presence of the bla (SHV) gene, using PCR, and eight isolates were analyzed by DNA sequencing. This gene was detected in 16 isolates from hospital infections, four from community infections, and nine from the normal microbiota. This was the first study to find the bla (SHV) gene in K. pneumoniae isolates from the normal microbiota. Through DNA sequencing of eight K. pneumoniae isolates from hospital and community infections, with a resistance phenotype indicative of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production, a new SHV variant named SHV-122 was found. We also detected the presence of bla (SHV-1), bla (SHV-11), bla (SHV-28), and bla (SHV-108). The results show that in Recife, Brazil, K. pneumoniae isolates that presented resistance to oxyimino-beta-lactams had high prevalence and diversity of the bla (SHV) gene. We also conclude that there was a high presence of the bla (SHV) gene among isolates from the normal microbiota of healthy individuals.
