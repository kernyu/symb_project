Flavusides A (1) and B (2), two new antibacterial cerebroside derivatives, and the previously described phomaligol A (3), kojic acid (4), methyl kojic acid (5), and dimethyl kojic acid (6) have been isolated from the extract of a marine isolate of the fungus Aspergillus flavus. The structure and absolute stereochemistry of two cerebrosides were assigned on the basis of NMR and Tandem FAB-MS/MS experiments. Compounds 1, 2, and 3 exhibited a mild antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and multidrug-resistant S. aureus. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for each strain are as follows: compounds 1 and 2 showed 15.6 mug/ml for S. aureus and 31.2 mug/ml for methicillin-resistant S. aureus and multidrug-resistant S. aureus, and compound 3 exhibited 31.2 mug/ml for S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus and 62.5 mug/ml for multidrug-resistant S. aureus.
