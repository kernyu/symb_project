We are pleased to dedicate this paper to Dr Julian E Davies. Julian is a giant among microbial biochemists. He began his professional career as an organic chemistry PhD student at Nottingham University, moved on to a postdoctoral fellowship at Columbia University, then became a lecturer at the University of Manchester, followed by a fellowship in microbial biochemistry at Harvard Medical School. In 1965, he studied genetics at the Pasteur Institute, and 2 years later joined the University of Wisconsin in the Department of Biochemistry. He later became part of Biogen as Research Director and then President. After Biogen, Julian became Chair of the Department of Microbiology at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, where he has contributed in a major way to the reputation of this department for many years. He also served as an Adjunct Professor at the University of Geneva. Among Julian's areas of study and accomplishment are fungal toxins including alpha-sarcin, chemical synthesis of triterpenes, mode of action of streptomycin and other aminoglycoside antibiotics, biochemical mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in clinical isolates of bacteria harboring resistance plasmids, their origins and evolution, secondary metabolism of microorganisms, structure and function of bacterial ribosomes, antibiotic resistance mutations in yeast ribosomes, cloning of resistance genes from an antibiotic-producing microbe, gene cloning for industrial purposes, engineering of herbicide resistance in useful crops, bleomycin-resistance gene in clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and many other topics. He has been an excellent teacher, lecturing in both English and French around the world, and has organized international courses. Julian has also served on the NIH study sections, as Editor for several international journals, and was one of the founders of the journal Plasmid. We expect the impact of Julian's accomplishments to continue into the future.
