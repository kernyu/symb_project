OBJECTIVES: In this study we aimed to verify a real-time trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) monitoring system in a Caco-2 monolayer and to investigate the therapeutic effect of partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG), a dietary fiber, against interferon (IFN)-gamma-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction using this monitoring system. METHODS: We measured TEER using a real-time monitoring system and evaluated epithelial paracellular permeability using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated dextran (4 kDa; FD4) in Caco-2 monolayers treated with IFN-gamma for 48 h. The expression and distribution of tight junction (TJ)-associated proteins, ZO-1 and occludin, were analyzed by Western blot and immunocytochemistry, respectively. In some experiments PHGG was added prior to IFN-gamma treatment in order to investigate its protective effect on barrier function. RESULTS: IFN-gamma treatment significantly decreased TEER and increased FD4 flux across Caco-2 monolayers, indicating a great influence of IFN-gamma on the intestinal epithelial paracellular permeability. In contrast, the pretreatment of PHGG significantly reduced the IFN-gamma-induced increment of FD4 flux without affecting TEER. Neither IFN-gamma nor PHGG treatment affected the expressions of TJ-associated proteins, while immunocytochemistry showed that IFN-gamma-induced redistribution of occludin was clearly restored by PHGG. CONCLUSIONS: Real-time TEER monitoring enabled us to evaluate the dynamic changes of intestinal epithelial barrier function. PHGG may have a protective effect against IFN-gamma-induced barrier dysfunction by attenuating the paracellular hyperpermeability; thus, its promotion as a functional food is anticipated.
