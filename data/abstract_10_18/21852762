BACKGROUND: A small group of children have second and even more cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt infections (SIs). We sought to describe the treatment approaches used for, and the microbiology of, repeated SIs. METHODS: The study population included 31 children with second shunt infection (SI-2) among those undergoing initial CSF shunt placement and treatment for initial infection at Primary Children's Medical Center. CSF SI was defined as follows: (1) presence of bacteria in Gram stain and/or culture of CSF, wound, and/or pseudocyst; (2) visible hardware; (3) abdominal pseudocyst; or (4) presence of bacteria in a blood culture in children with a ventriculoatrial shunt. Infection rates were generated using per-patient denominators, and the concordance of organisms across infections was summarized. RESULTS: Of the 31 children with SI-2, most were less than 6 months of age at initial shunt placement (81%), male (77%), and with ventriculoperitoneal shunts (71%). Of total, 18 developed SI-3 and 8 developed SI-4. Infection rates were 60% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 42%-75%, n = 18/30) for SI-3 and 47% (95% CI: 26%-69%, n = 8/17) for SI-4. The median time to SI-3 was 477 days (range, 5-828) and to SI-4 it was 2137 days (range, 9-2137). Gram-positive organisms predominated (93% of SI-2, 94% of SI-3). The majority of SI-2 demonstrated Gram-stain concordance with both the initial (first) SI (58%, 95% CI: 41%-74%) and with the following (third) SI (78%, 95% CI: 55%-91%). CONCLUSIONS: Children with SI-2 experience high subsequent reinfection rates with a long time to reinfection.
