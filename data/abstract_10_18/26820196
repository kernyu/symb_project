BACKGROUND: The treatment of nosocomial infections is hindered by the increasing antimicrobial resistance pattern of germs that cause them. The objective was to assess trends in resistance of bacteria isolated from nosocomial infections. METHODS: Retrospective study from 2009 to 2012 on a third level hospital in Chiapas. RESULTS: 1300 germs were obtained, 62.3 % Gram negative bacteria, 22.8 % Gram positive and 14.9 % yeasts; imipenem resistance of P. aeruginosa went from 47.1 to 60.5 %, E. coli showed an increased resistance to aztreonam, cefepime and ceftazidime, A. baumannii increased resistance to amikacin, cefepime, ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin. Klebsiella pneumoniae decreased its resistance to amikacin and piperacillin/tazobactam; vancomycin resistance ranges from 3.6 to 25.5 %. CONCLUSION: Gram negative organisms predominated, showing increasing trends in antimicrobial resistance. There was a proportional increase in the incidence of infection from E. coli, C. tropicalis and S. haemolyticus. It is essential to have programs and plans for the rational and evidence-based use of antimicrobials, as well as dissemination and adherence to clinical practice guidelines and the implementation of innovative programs for the prevention and control of nosocomial infections, isolation techniques and general care.
