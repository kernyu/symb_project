Skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) due to Alcaligenes faecalis is very rare and has never been studied. The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical and microbiological characteristics of this infection. We conducted a retrospective review of 5 cases that occurred at our institution over a period of 6 years. All patients had underlying diseases, and infection was secondary to vascular disease or recent surgery in 4 of them. The most common clinical presentations were vascular ulcer infection and surgical site infection. The clinical outcome was uniformly good after treatment, except in 1 patient. In conclusion, A. faecalis should be considered a potential pathogen of SSTI, particularly in patients with vascular diseases or after surgery. The history of contact with water or aqueous solutions should be investigated in all cases. The clinical outcome is usually good, but treatment can be difficult in some cases due to the high level of resistance to commonly used antibiotics.
