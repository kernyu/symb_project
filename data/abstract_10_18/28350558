PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of clinical burden in the United States and worldwide, as a percentage of patients can develop complications such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. RECENT FINDINGS: Therapy for chronic HCV infection was previously interferon-based, but with the advent of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), there has been a dramatic improvement in eradicating the virus with favourable side effect profiles. SUMMARY: Emerging data are demonstrating new successful agents in difficult-to-manage populations. This review is aimed to provide a brief overview of currently accepted therapy, as well providing new information on upcoming therapeutic agents available for practioners going forward.
