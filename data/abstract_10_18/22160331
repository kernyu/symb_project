Bacterial biofilms are associated with chronic infections due to their resistance to antimicrobial agents. Staphylococcus aureus is a versatile human pathogen and can form biofilms on human tissues and diverse medical devices. To identify novel biofilm inhibitors of S. aureus, the supernatants from a library of 458 Actinomycetes strains were screened. The culture supernatants (1% v/v) of more than 10 Actinomycetes strains inhibited S. aureus biofilm formation by more than 80% without affecting the growth. The culture supernatants of these biofilm-reducing Actinomycetes strains contained a protease (equivalent to 0.1 mug proteinase K ml(-1)), which both inhibited S. aureus biofilm formation and detached pre-existing S. aureus biofilms. This study suggests that protease treatment could be a feasible tool to reduce and eradicate S. aureus biofilms.
