OBJECTIVE: The study intended to investigate the effect and mechanism of endoplasmic reticulum stress on cisplatin resistance in ovarian carcinoma. METHODS: RT-PCR and Western blot were used to test the expression of mTOR and Beclin1 mRNA and protein in ovarian cancer SKOV3 cells after saquinavir induction. MTT assay was used to analyze the influence of saquinavir on cisplatin sensitivity in SKOV3 cells. RESULTS: The IC50 of SKOV3 cells was (5.490 +/- 1.148) microg/ml. After induced by Saquinavair 10 micromol/L and 20 micromol/L, the IC50 of SKOV3 cells was increased to (11.199 +/- 0.984) microg/ml and (14.906 +/- 2.015) microg/ml, respectively. It suggested that the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin was decreased significantly (P = 0.001). The expression of mTOR and Beclin1 mRNA and protein was significantly different among the five groups: the (Saquinavair+DDP) group of, Saquinavair group, LY294002 group, DDP group and control group (P < 0.001) . The expressions of mTOR and Beclin1 mRNA were highest in the (Saquinavair+DDP) group, 0.684 +/- 0.072 and 0.647 +/- 0.047, respectively; Secondly, the Saquinavair group, 0.577 +/- 0.016 and 0.565 +/- 0.037, respectively. The expressions of mTOR and Beclin1 proteins were also highest in the (Saquinavair+DDP) group, 0.624 +/- 0.058 and 0.924 +/- 0.033, respectively, followed by the Saquinavair group, 0.544 +/- 0.019 and 0.712 +/- 0.024. 3-MA inhibited the autophagy and restored cisplatin sensitivity in the SKOV3 cells after Saquinavir induced ER stress (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Saquinavir can effectively induce endoplasmic reticulum stress in SKOV3 cells. Endoplasmic reticulum stress can decrease the sensitivity to cisplatin in SKOV3 cells. The mechanism of the decrease of sensitivity to cisplatin in SKOV3 cells may be that ERS regulates cell autophagy through the mTOR and Beclin1 pathways. ERS of tumor cells and autophagy may become a new target to improve the therapeutic effect of chemotherapy and to reverse the drug resistance in tumor treatment.
