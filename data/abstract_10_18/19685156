Some antifungal agents have shown to exert effects on expression of virulent factors of Candida as the production of secretory aspartyl proteinase (Sap). In this study, we sought to determine and to compare the influence of fluconazole and voriconazole in proteinase activity of this microorganism. Thirty-one isolates obtained from oral mucosa of human immunodeficiency virus positive (HIV) patients were used in this study. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of fluconazole and voriconazole were determined using the broth microdilution method with RPMI 1640 medium and with yeast carbon base-bovine serum albumin (YCB-BSA) medium. The Sap activity following by digestion of BSA as substrate was determined for four Candida albicans strains arbitrarily chosen according to susceptibility (susceptible or resistant) to fluconazole or voriconazole. Besides, the SAP1 to SAP7 genes were screened by PCR for the same isolates that were determined by the Sap activity. In vitro susceptibility testing using the two media presented similar MIC values. Increased Sap activity was observed in resistant isolates on presence of drugs, but the Sap activity by susceptible isolates to azoles showed different behavior on the presence of drug. We detected the presence of SAP1 to SAP7 genes from all susceptible or resistant C. albicans isolates. The present study provides important data about the proteinase activity and the presence of genes of SAP family in fluconazole and voriconazole susceptible or resistant C. albicans isolates.
