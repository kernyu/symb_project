Antimicrobial stewardship programmes are increasingly being used to improve the quality of antimicrobial prescribing, with the dual aim of optimizing clinical outcomes and minimizing the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance. The Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (JAC) is celebrating its 40th anniversary and, as part of activities to commemorate this event, this article highlights the contribution of JAC to antimicrobial stewardship. Papers published in JAC have contributed to the evidence base for stewardship, have highlighted educational and behavioural change initiatives aimed at improving antibiotic prescribing practice, and have actively sought to foster the practice of antimicrobial stewardship amongst its readers.
