The immunomodulatory effect of Siegesbeckia glabrescens extract-supplementation diets on innate immune response and disease resistance of kelp grouper, Epinephelus bruneus against Vibrio parahaemolyticus at weeks 1, 2, and 4 is reported. The serum lysozyme activity was significantly enhanced with any enriched diet from weeks 1-4 when compared to control diet (0%). The alternative complement haemolytic activities significantly were enhanced with all enriched diets on weeks 2 and 4 whereas the cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was significantly enhanced only with 1.0% and 2.0% diets. The reactive nitrogen intermediate (RNI) value was significantly enhanced with any enriched diet on weeks 2 and 4, but on first week it did not differ from control. The myeloperoxidase (MPO) production significantly increased with 1.0% and 2.0% diets from second week onwards; with other enriched diets the increase manifested on fourth week; but during first week it did not vary from that of the control with any enriched diet. The protection in terms of cumulative mortality was the least being 25% and 20% when fed with 1.0% and 2.0% diets. The present results indicate that feeding kelp grouper with S. glabrescens extract enriched diet at 1.0% and 2.0% levels significantly enhance the immunological parameters, increase the disease resistance and minimize the cumulative mortality in E. bruneus against V. parahaemolyticus.
