We collected 97 non-repetitive carbapenemases-sensitive clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Human Province, China, during the period of October 2006 to January 2007. From these isolates, we identified two novel oxacillin-hydrolysing (OXA) type extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases (ESBLs): bla OXA-128 and bla OXA-129, which contain the mutations of I89V from bla OXA-56 and K134N from bla OXA-10, respectively. Clinical isolates containing either bla OXA-128 or bla OXA-129 show resistance to cephamycin-class antibiotics but sensitive to carbapenem-class antibiotics. The occurrence of novel OXA-type lactamases suggests a regional prevalent pattern of ESBLs Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this area.
