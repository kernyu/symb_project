Knowledge of epidemiology and microbial resistance helps clinicians carry out appropriate infection control strategies. A retrospective study in a comprehensive hospital, including a burn center, and using CHINET (the surveillance system for bacterial epidemiology and resistance in China) from 2007-2013 revealed that gram-negative Acinetobacter baumannii in the burn center demonstrated higher resistance rates to ceftazidime, amikacin, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, and cefoperazone-sulbactam compared with the hospital and CHINET data. The high rate of antibiotic use in the burn center may have contributed to these results.
