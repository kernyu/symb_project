Plasmid-mediated and chromosomally-encoded colistin resistance is increasingly being reported worldwide. We aimed to determine the prevalence of faecal carriage of colistin-resistant Gram-negative rod isolates in a university hospital in western France. From February to May 2016, rectal swabs from 653 patients hospitalized in various clinical settings were recovered and subsequently screened for colistin resistance using the SuperPolymyxin medium. Antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined according to EUCAST guidelines. Genetic detection of plasmid-mediated colistin resistance was performed by PCR. The faecal carriage with intrinsic colistin-resistant isolates was high (23 %), while the faecal carriage with Gram-negative rods showing acquired resistance was low (1.4 %). No isolate carried the plasmid-mediated mcr-1/mcr-2 genes. It was noteworthy that none of the patients carrying isolates with acquired colistin resistance had previously received a colistin-based treatment, while these isolates were not multidrug resistant.
