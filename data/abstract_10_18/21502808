Cancer stem cells are defined as a subpopulation of cancer cells with the capacity to self-renew and differentiate, which may play critical roles in tumor initiation, progress and resistance to current treatments. It has been reported that Dendritic cells (DCs) transfected with total tumor RNA could induce strong antitumor T-cell responses both in vivo and in vitro. In the study, we investigated the characteristics of 9L tumor spheres, and evaluated the antitumor effects of DCs transfected with 9L tumor spheres RNA in vivo. The results showed that 9L tumor spheres have the properties of cancer stem cells, and the majority of 9L cells were positive for CD133 and nestin. DCs transfected with 9L tumor spheres RNA can significantly inhibit glioma growth and prolong the survival of 9L glioma-bearing rats. These results demonstrated that 9L cancer stem like cells were enriched in tumor spheres, and they were a part of CD133+ cells, DCs transfected with cancer stem cells RNA may be an effective therapy for glioma.
