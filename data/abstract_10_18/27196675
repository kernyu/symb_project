High rates of sustained virologic response (SVR) has been achieved in Japanese patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype (GT)1 and GT2 infection treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) +/-ribavirin (RBV) and SOF+RBV, respectively. We evaluated the effect of baseline HCV NS5A and NS5B resistance-associated variants (RAVs) on treatment outcome and characterized variants at virologic failure. Baseline deep sequencing for NS5A and NS5B genes was performed for all GT1 patients. Deep sequencing of NS5A (GT1 only) and NS5B (GT1 and GT2) was performed for patients who failed treatment or discontinued early with detectable HCV RNA (i.e., >25 IU/mL). In patients with HCV GT1 infection, 22.3% (GT1a: 2/11; GT1b: 74/330) had >/=1 baseline NS5A RAV. The most frequent NS5A RAVs in GT1b were Y93H (17.9%, 59/330) and L31M (2.4%, 8/330). Despite the presence of NS5A RAVs at baseline, 100% and 97% of patients achieved SVR12, compared with 100% and 99% for those with no NS5A RAVs with LDV/SOF and LDV/SOF+RBV, respectively. All patients with NS5B RAVs at baseline achieved SVR12. Of the 153 patients with GT2 infection (GT2a 60.1%, GT2b 39.9%), 3.3% (5/153) experienced viral relapse. No S282T or other NS5B RAVs were detected at baseline or relapse; no change in susceptibility to SOF or RBV was observed at relapse. In conclusion, LDV/SOF and SOF+RBV demonstrate a high barrier to resistance in Japanese patients with HCV GT1 and GT2 infection. The presence of baseline NS5A RAVs did not impact treatment outcome in GT1 Japanese patients treated with LDV/SOF for 12 weeks.
