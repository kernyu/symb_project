Colistin-resistant mutants were obtained from 17 colistin-susceptible strains of Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. The stability of colistin resistance in these mutants was investigated. Three of four colistin-resistant P. aeruginosa mutants recovered colistin susceptibility in colistin-free medium; however, colistin-susceptible revertants were obtained from only one strain each of A. baumannii and E. coli. No susceptible revertants were obtained from K. pneumoniae mutants.
