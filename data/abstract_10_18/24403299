Thirty-two carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, representative of different resistance mechanisms and clonal lineages, were analyzed with the Pathogenica HAI BioDetection system, based on targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. With most strains, the system simultaneously yielded comprehensive information on relevant beta-lactam resistance determinants and accurate discrimination of clonal lineages, in a shorter time frame and in a less labor-intensive manner than currently available methods for molecular epidemiology analysis. Results supported the usefulness of targeted NGS-based technologies for similar applications.
