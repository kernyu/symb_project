Twenty of 1,279 nontyphoid Salmonella strains isolated from food animals and humans produced CTX-M-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. All expressed CTX-M-15, except two which coexpressed CTX-M-14 and TEM-1. Insertion sequence ISEcp1 was identified upstream of bla(CTX-M) genes. The bla(CTX-M-15) and bla(CTX-M-14) genes were disseminated by large conjugative IncFIIs and IncI1-Igamma plasmids, respectively.
