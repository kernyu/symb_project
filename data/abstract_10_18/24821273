BACKGROUND: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a devastating pathogen that is associated with high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Livestock are a well-known reservoir for this pathogen, which poses substantial health risks for livestock workers. Little is known about the epidemiology of livestock-associated MRSA (LA-MRSA) among livestock workers in Eastern Europe. METHODS: To study the epidemiology of LA-MRSA among swine workers in Romania, we collected and characterized nasal and oropharygneal samples from swine workers on commercial pig farms. A survey that included questions about work-related tasks, biosafety practices, contact with animals, and health status was used to assess the risk factors that were potentially associated with LA-MRSA colonization. RESULTS: The prevalence of MRSA colonization among swine workers was 6.8%. Two LA-MRSA strains with the spa types t034 and t011 and one likely community-associated MRSA strain with the spa type t321 were isolated from workers on five farms. Interestingly, all MRSA carriers worked on farms that imported animals from other production facilities. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to confirm the presence of LA-MRSA among swine workers in Romania and suggests the need to minimize the risk of LA-MRSA-related infections in swine workers and their community contacts. The findings also suggest a link between the commercial movement of swine and the introduction of LA-MRSA.
