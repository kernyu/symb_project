This study demonstrated a direct correlation between Acinetobacter baumannii clusters carrying the ISAba1/blaOXA-23 gene and increased minimal inhibitory concentrations for carbapenems and greater clonal diversity. Our findings showed that clusters carrying ISAba1 are widely distributed in our hospital, further complicating the treatment and control of infections caused by A baumannii.
