OBJECTIVES: Acinetobacter baumannii is an important opportunistic pathogen and multidrug-resistant isolate. Although tigecycline is a potent antibiotic for treating infections with multidrug-resistant isolates, resistance is becoming a problem. This study aimed to explore the mechanism of tigecycline resistance in A. baumannii. METHODS: A serial passage experiment was performed to collect isolates selected by tigecycline. The expression of efflux pumps was quantified in the final selected isolate, 19606-T8. The whole genome of 19606-T8 was sequenced and the putative mutations were confirmed using PCR and Sanger sequencing. A complementation experiment was performed to evaluate the contribution of the mutations to decreased susceptibility to tigecycline. The significance of a deletion mutation was further investigated in terms of growth rate and antibiotic susceptibilities. RESULTS: We collected serial isolates by selective pressure of tigecycline, and designated them 19606-T1 to 19606-T8. The efflux pumps AdeABC, AdeFGH and AdeIJK were not overexpressed in 19606-T8, which had decreased susceptibility to tigecycline. Isolate 19606-T8 carried one deletion mutation in trm and three non-synonymous substitutions in msbA (A84V), lolA (P91L) and filC (N168K). The deletion mutation in trm (encoding S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase) resulted in decreased susceptibility to tigecycline as well as to minocycline and doxycycline. In complementation experiments, the MICs of tigecycline, minocycline and doxycycline in a tigecycline-resistant isolate were restored by complementation with wild-type trm. CONCLUSIONS: Given that the deletion mutation in trm was associated with decreased susceptibility to tigecycline and that a wild-type trm plasmid could restore the susceptibility, trm is considered to play an important role in decreased susceptibility to tigecycline in A. baumannii.
