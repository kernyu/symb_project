There are growing concerns about the coselection of resistance against antibiotics and disinfectants in bacterial pathogens. The aim of this study was to characterize the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes (PMQRs), and quaternary ammonium compound resistance genes (QACs) in Escherichia coli isolated from ready-to-eat (RTE) meat products obtained in Guangzhou, China, and to determine whether these genes were colocalized in the isolates. A total of 64 E. coli isolates were obtained from 720 RTE meat samples. Multidrug resistance was observed in 70.3% of the isolates. A 100% of the isolates were resistant to benzalkonium chloride. Four types of beta-lactamase genes were identified in the 16 ESBL-producing E. coli isolates: blaSHV (9.4%), blaTEM (7.8%), blaCTX-M-15 (1.6%), and blaCTX-M-9 (1.6%). PMQRs were present in nine isolates (14.1%), with aac(6')-Ib-cr and qnrD detected in eight (12.5%) and one isolate (1.6%), respectively. The QACs ydgE/ydgF were most commonly present (60.9%), while qacF, mdfA, sugE(p), emrE, qacG, sugE(c), and qacE were less prevalent (1.6%-18.8%). Coexistence of ESBLs and/or PMQRs with QACs was found in 21 isolates (32.8%). The aac(6')-Ib-cr and blaCTX-M-15 genes were found to be cotransferred with qacF in one isolate. The data obtained in this study indicate that ESBLs and/or PMQRs with QACs can not only be colocalized but can also be cotransferred in E. coli isolates from RTE meat products. The E. coli isolates with multiple antimicrobial resistance genes may transmit to humans through food chain and thus require further investigation and increased awareness.
