OBJECTIVE: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotyping and detection of resistance to drugs have become essential in epidemiological and clinical diagnosis. Our main objective was to determine the prevalence of HBV genotypes and drug-resistance mutations in chronic asymptomatic carriers and chronic HBV sufferers comparing 2 detection assays. METHODS: Serum samples from 28 chronic HBV patients and 22 chronic asymptomatic carriers were analyzed. For HBV genotyping, the INNO-LIPA and TRUGENE HBV genotyping kits were evaluated. For drug-resistance mutations, INNO-LIPA DR v2 and INNO-LIPA DR v3 prototype and the TRUGENE HBV genotyping kit were evaluated. RESULTS: In HBV genotyping, concordant results were 98% and both assays were able to detect more than one genotype. Different genotypes were detected, the most prevalent being D (46%) and A (26%). In relation to drug-resistance mutations, the sensitivity of the line probe assay was lower than TRUGENE because INNO-LIPA could not detect two mutations (S202G and V214A). CONCLUSIONS: Both assays are easy and suitable for detecting HBV genotype and drug-resistance mutations and for routine laboratory use. However, TRUGENE presented better sensitivity in both analyses and it is possible to conduct both on the same sample. This assay is also able to detect primary and secondary mutations.
