OBJECTIVE: To study the cross-resistance between rifampin and rifabutin in multidrug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex strains, and therefore to provide laboratory data for using rifabutin in the treatment of multidrug resistant tuberculosis. METHODS: The MIC(90) of rifabutin and rifampin against 99 multidrug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical strains were determined by microplate assays. Statistical analysis was performed by using the chi(2) test and the t test. RESULTS: The cross-resistance rate between rifampicin and rifabutin was 85.9% (85/99), but the MIC(90) of rifabutin (</= 16 mg/L, median 2 mg/L) was significantly lower than that of rifampicin (>/= 2 mg/L, median > 32 mg/L). The cross-resistance rate increased with the resistance level of rifampicin. The cross-resistance strains in the lower and the medium groups were 0/9 and 5/9 respectively, while the strains of the high rifampicin-resistant group were almost all cross-resistant (98.8%, 80/81). CONCLUSION: Rifabutin had activities against rifampin resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex strains in vitro, and therefore may be used as an alternative for the treatment of multidrug resistant tuberculosis.
