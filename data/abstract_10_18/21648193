The new hybrid drugs combining in a single molecule triazine ring attached to phosphonium salt were prepared and their bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus ATCC43300 (MRSA - methycyline resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain) two Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli CCUG31997 serotype O153 (EPEC - enteropathogenic Escherichia coli strain), Proteus mirabilis 1784 (MDR - multidrug resistant clinical strain) were determined using microdilution method.
