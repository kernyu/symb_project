Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 258 Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates by Etest determined that 60.1% were multidrug resistant (MDR), while 5% of the strains had decreased susceptibility to currently recommended extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs). Among these, 84.5% of MDR strains and 76.9% of strains that had decreased susceptibility to ESCs were susceptible to gentamicin. No MDR isolate was resistant to gentamicin. These in vitro results suggest that gentamicin might be an effective treatment option for the MDR strains and in dual therapy for gonorrhea. However, further research regarding the clinical treatment outcomes is essential.
