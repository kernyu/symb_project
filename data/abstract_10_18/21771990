Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) both emerged in the second half of the 20th century, and chronic infection with these agents is among the greatest challenges facing health care in the United States and worldwide. Despite tremendous advances in treatment and management of HIV and HCV, individuals with HIV/HCV coinfection experience a more complicated disease course and treatment. Recognition of the important role that host factors, such as IL28B genotype, have in response to HCV therapy and the emergence of new effective therapies for HCV are actively reshaping the standard of care. These advances may translate into more effective treatment and management of patients with chronic HCV and HIV coinfection in the years ahead.
