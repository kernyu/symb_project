In New Caledonia, South Pacific, Acinetobacter baumannii is a nosocomial pathogen. OXA-23 carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) has been ranked third among all multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria at the main hospital of Noumea in New Caledonia (24.8%, 50/202 isolates). In the present study, risk factors and outcomes for 50 patients with CRAB infection were compared with those of 152 patients infected with other MDR bacteria. Independent risk factors for infection with CRAB were respiratory ward admission (odds ratio 2.8, 95% confidence interval 1.1-7.1) and previous treatment with quinolones, beta-lactams and anti-MRSA antibiotics. The 30-day mortality was higher for CRAB infections compared with other MDR infections (14% vs 3.3%, p = 0.006). These findings highlight the importance of knowing specific local characteristics relating to the ecology and patterns of resistance of MDR bacteria so as to avoid the emergence of unexpected pan-resistant bacteria.
