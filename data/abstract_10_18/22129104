Aminosterols possessing potent fungicidal activity are attractive alternatives to currently available antifungals. Although their precise mechanism of action is not fully understood, the effect of 7-aminocholesterol (7-ACH) involves a partial block of Delta8-Delta7 isomerase and C-14 reductase. The function of RTA1 encoding the 7-transmembrane helix protein, cloned as the multicopy suppressor of 7-ACH toxicity in yeast, remains unclear. In this report, we show that Rta1p is localized in the plasma membrane and has a high rate of metabolic turnover, as revealed by fluorescence microscopy, cell fractionation and pulse-chase experiments. Analysis of the RTA1-lacZ reporter activity and deletion mapping of the promoter allowed the identification of the regions responsible for negative regulation by Tup1 and the two synergistically acting repressors of hypoxic genes, Rox1p and Mot3p. This was in line with increased RTA1-mediated resistance to 7-ACH under hypoxic conditions, associated with increased Rta1p level. Overexpression of RTA1 also affected the response to the signalling sphingolipid precursor phytosphingosine. Positive inputs of two transcriptional activators Pdr1p and Upc2p were also detected, indicating a regulatory link common to sterol biosynthetic genes as well as those involved in pleiotropic drug resistance and sphingolipid metabolism.
