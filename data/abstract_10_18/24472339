In 2012, the Dutch Working Party on Antibiotic Policy (SWAB) published a vision document to counteract the rise in antibiotic use and resistance. An Antibiotic Stewardship Programme (ASP) will be implemented by a multidisciplinary antibiotics team (A-team). In 2012 University Medical Centre Groningen (UMCG) in the Netherlands started an Antibiotic Stewardship Programme (ASP) pilot project at the trauma surgery ward. The focus is on providing bedside consultation for patients based on the day 2 bundle. Implementation of the ASP on the basis of a day 2 bundle resulted in an intervention percentage of 75%. The pilot project was a success and will be extended to other wards.
