OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to conduct a comparative analysis with reported IncR plasmids of a Klebsiella pneumoniae IncR plasmid carrying an MDR region. METHODS: MDR K. pneumoniae isolates were serially identified from two inpatients at a hospital in the USA in 2014. MDR plasmid pYDC676 was fully sequenced, annotated and compared with related plasmids. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, PFGE and MLST were also conducted. RESULTS: The K. pneumoniae isolates were identical by PFGE, belonged to ST37 and harboured an identical approximately 50 kb IncR plasmid (pYDC676). pYDC676 possessed the backbone and multi-IS loci closely related to IncR plasmids reported from aquatic bacteria, as well as animal and human K. pneumoniae strains, and carried an MDR region consisting of armA, blaDHA-1 and qnrB4, a combination that has been reported in IncR plasmids from K. pneumoniae ST11 strains in Europe and Asia. A plasmid with the identical IncR backbone and a similar MDR region containing blaDHA-1 and qnrB4 has also been reported in ST37 strains from Europe, suggesting potential dissemination of this lineage of IncR plasmids in K. pneumoniae ST37. CONCLUSIONS: K. pneumoniae ST37 strains with an MDR IncR plasmid carrying armA, blaDHA-1 and qnrB4 were identified in a hospital in the USA, where these resistance genes remain rare. The IncR backbone may play a role in the global dissemination of these resistance genes.
