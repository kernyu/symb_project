This study aimed to assess the economic burden of infection control measures that succeeded in eradicating multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) in emerging epidemic contexts in hospital settings. The MEDLINE, EMBASE and Ovid databases were systematically interrogated for original English-language articles detailing costs associated with strict measures to eradicate MDROs published between 1 January 1974 and 2 November 2014. This study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Overall, 13 original articles were retrieved reporting data on several MDROs, including glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (n = 5), carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriacae (n = 1), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (n = 5), and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 2). Overall, the cost of strict measures to eradicate MDROs ranged from euro285 to euro57 532 per positive patient. The major component of these overall costs was related to interruption of new admissions, representing euro2466 to euro47 093 per positive patient (69% of the overall mean cost; range, 13-100%), followed by mean laboratory costs of euro628 to euro5849 (24%; range, 3.3-56.7%), staff reinforcement costs of euro6204 to euro148 381 (22%; range, 3.3-52%), and contact precautions costs of euro166 to euro10 438 per positive patient (18%; range, 0.7-43.3%). Published data on the economic burden of strict measures to eradicate MDROs are limited, heterogeneous, and weakened by several methodological flaws. Novel economic studies should be performed to assess the financial impact of current policies, and to identify the most cost-effective strategies to eradicate emerging MDROs in healthcare facilities.
