Based on estimates from the World Health Organization (WHO), there were 8.7 million new cases of tuberculosis (TB) and 1.4 million deaths globally in 2011. In Germany, TB has become a rare disease (incidence 5.3/100,000). Therefore, experience regarding the management and treatment of TB patients is decreasing. In this review, standard therapy of TB and the drugs administered are described. Prior to initiation of therapy, a thorough patient history must be taken to evaluate the risk factors for a drug-resistant TB. In addition, bacterial confirmation via microscopic and culture analyses and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing are also recommended. Treatment of TB is always based on combined antibiotic therapy. The selection of the drugs is determined by the resistance status of the strains. For detailed recommendations refer to the current recommendations of the German Central Committee against Tuberculosis e. V. (DZK) and the German Respiratory Society (DGP).
