Vapor sensitive transducer films consisting of chitosan grafted (CNT-CS) and chitosan-co-polycaprolactone grafted (CNT-CS-PCL) multiwalled carbon nanotubes were prepared using a spray layer-by-layer technique. The synthesized materials (CNT-CS and CNT-CS-PCL) were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, 13C CP/MAS solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. Both CNT-CS and CNT-CS-PCL transducers were analyzed for the response of volatile organic compounds and toluene vapors. The ranking of the relative resistance (A(r)) for both chitosan based transducers were as follows: toluene < chloroform < ethanol < methanol. The CNT transducer (CNT-CS) was correlated selectively with an exponential law to the inverse of Flory-Huggins interaction parameters, chi12. Dosing the films on the interdigitated electrodes with methanol, ethanol, chloroform and toluene vapors increased the film resistance of CNT-CS but decreased the resistance of CNT-CS-PCL compared to that of the reported transducers.
