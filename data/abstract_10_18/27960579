PURPOSE: To investigate the genus distribution of bacteria and fungi associated with keratitis in a large eye center located in Southern China and to compare the results with existing data from other areas in China. METHODS: All results of corneal microbiological examinations from 2009 to 2013 of patients who had been clinically diagnosed with bacterial or fungal keratitis were obtained chronologically and anonymously from the microbiology database at Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center. Smear/culture data were reviewed and analyzed. Antibiotic resistance of the harvested bacteria was also evaluated. RESULTS: Of 2973 samples, the microbial detection rate was 46.05%; in which 759 eyes (25.5%) were positive for bacteria, 796 eyes (26.8%) were positive for fungi, and 186 eyes (6.3%) were co-infected with both fungi and bacteria. The most common type of bacteria isolated was Staphylococcus epidermidis (31.9%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.4%). The most common type of fungus was Fusarium species (29.3%), followed by Aspergillus species (24.1%). For the bacteria harvested, mean antibiotic resistance was chloromycetin (34.6%), cephalosporins (20.0%), fluoroquinolones (18.6%), and aminoglycosides (10.5%). CONCLUSION: The genus distribution of organisms detected in keratitis cases in the largest eye center located in Southern China differs from those in other areas in China. In Southern China during the time period studied, S. epidermidis and Fusarium sp. were the most common pathogens of infectious keratitis. Monitoring the changing trend of pathogens as well as antibiotic resistance are warranted.
