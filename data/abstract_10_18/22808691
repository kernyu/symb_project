We investigated the susceptibility to antibacterial agents of 334 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from medical facilities in Gifu and Aichi prefectures from May to September 2008. For the beta-lactams, meropenem (MEPM) and doripenem (DRPM) gave the lowest MIC50 at 0.5 microg/mL, and tazobactam/piperacillin (TAZ/PIPC) gave the highest susceptible rate of the breakpoint by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) at 93.1%. For the quinolones, ciprofloxacin (CPFX) gave the lowest MIC50 at 0.25 microg/mL, followed by pazufloxacin (PZFX) at 0.5 microg/mL, and levofloxacin (LVFX) at 1 microg/mL, and susceptible rate was 76.0% for CPFX and 73.4% for LVFX. Susceptible rates to amikacin (AMK) and tobramycin (TOB) of aminoglycocides and colistin (CL) of polypeptides were 98.2%, 97.6% and 96.4%. In 334 strains, IMP-1 MBL producing P. aeruginosa was 1 strain, and the strain showed resistance to all antibacterial agents except AMK and CL used in this study. The strains isolated from urine were lower susceptible rate in comparison with those from sputum, notably the susceptible rate to CPFX from urine was less over 30% than those from sputum. Because the results of the susceptibility test against P. aeruginosa were different in each area, it is important for us to pay attention to the susceptibility to antibacterial agents and the emergence of resistance in the clinical strains through continuous susceptibility surveillance.
