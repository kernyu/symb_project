In order to investigate the mutation of HBV polymerase gene reverse transcription conserved region (P region) in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, 212 CHB patients who took antiretroviral treatment with nucleotide analogues were chosen. The drug resistance mutations of HBV P region and HBV genotype were detected by Pyrosequencing. Sequence analysis showed that the drug resistance sites of HBV P region located at sites 173; 180; 181; 184; 204; 236 and 250. The main site of HBV P region drug resistance was 204 and 180, accounting for 35.8% and 23.5%, respectively. There were significant differences in the mutation rate of site 180 among different age groups. There were also significant differences in the mutation rate of site 204 among younger than 30 age group, 41 to 50 age group and 51 to 60 age group. (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). The mutation rate of site 180 combined with site 204 was 66.6%. The mutation rate of site 181 combined with site 236 was 23.3%. The age of C genotype infected patients was significantly older than B genotype infected patients (P < 0.01). M204V/I mutation mostly existed in the form of joint L180M mutation, the mutation rate was age-related. The detection of HBV genotypes and drug resistance sites of HBV P region have important clinical implications for the treatment and prognosis of patients with CHB.
