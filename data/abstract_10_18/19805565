The resistance mechanism of 49 Enterobacteriaceae isolates with decreased susceptibility to carbapenems collected from 2004 to 2008 at 16 teaching hospitals in China was investigated. Moderate- to high-level carbapenem resistance in most isolates was more closely associated with loss or decreased expression of both major porins combined with production of AmpC or extended-spectrum beta-lactamase enzymes, while KPC-2, IMP-4, and IMP-8 carbapenemase production may lead to a low to moderate level of carbapenem resistance in Enterobacteriaceae in China.
