We investigated the efficacy of colistin combined with teicoplanin or daptomycin in an experimental mouse model of multiresistant Acinetobacter baumannii infection. Animal received intraperitoneally 1ml saline containing 2x10(10)CFU of A. baumannii. Colistin, daptomycin, teicoplanin, and colistin plus daptomycin or teicoplanin were given by intraperitoneal administration 2h after bacterial challenge. A control group received sodium chloride solution. In the in vitro study A. baumannii showed to be susceptible only to colistin with MIC of 2mg/l. In the in vivo study, colistin alone showed a good antimicrobial efficacy. When combined with teicoplanin or daptomycin, colistin produced the lowest bacterial and the best survival rates. In immunological studies, when colistin was associated to daptomycin or teicoplanin, both the number and the cytotoxic activity of NK cells increased. In conclusion, colistin combined with teicoplanin or daptomycin may improve the therapy of multiresistant A. baumannii infection.
