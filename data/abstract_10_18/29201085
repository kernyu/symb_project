Infections are one of the most important causes of death, disability and inappropriate conditions for millions of people around the world. Therefore, the development in prognosis, prevention and treatment of infectious diseases made a considerable progress in designing and synthesis of new antimicrobial drugs. Nowadays, due to the increase in microbial resistance, discovery of new compounds with broad spectrum effects is granted. 4H-pyran derivatives and spiro compounds are the most important fragments in some effective drugs with antimicrobial activity. Therefore, in this study, 6 compounds with spiro-4H-pyran core were synthesized and evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against four different bacterial species using microbroth dilution and disk diffusion methods. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) has been measured for each compound and also for the standard antibiotic, gentamicin, and they were all compared together. According to our result, one of the spiropyran derivative (5d) containing both the indole and the cytosine ring, has been shown good antibacterial effects against standard and clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.
