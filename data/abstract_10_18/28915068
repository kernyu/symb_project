Transmission of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) from animal production systems to humans through the food supply is a public health concern. Currently, little is known about the prevalence of AMR among veal calves in the United States. Therefore, the objective of this prospective cohort study was to estimate the prevalence of AMR and multidrug resistance (MDR) among Escherichia coli within a vertically integrated production system. In addition, this study aimed to identify genes associated with phenotypic resistance to third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins (3GC and 4GC). Calves from four veal cohorts were randomly sampled resulting in a total of 166 farm fecal samples, 159 harvest fecal swabs, 164 preevisceration swabs, and 122 final carcass swabs. The prevalence of MDR among random-pick E. coli isolates recovered from the respective samples was 97% (161/166), 35% (55/159), 61% (51/84), and 24% (5/21). A selective isolation protocol found cefotaxime (a 3GC)-resistant isolates in 91% (127/140) of farm fecal samples, 34% (55/164) of preevisceration swabs, and 19% (23/122) of final carcass swabs tested. Isolates resistant to cefepime, a 4GC, were found among 24% (33/140), 6.7% (11/164), and 0.8% (1/122) of the same, respective samples. Isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, were recovered from 75% (73/98) of farm fecal samples, 23% (38/164) of preevisceration swabs, and 6.6% (8/122) of final carcass swabs. The blaCMY-2 and blaCTX-M resistance genes were found in 89% (93/105) and 100% (42/42) of tested subsets of 3GC- and 4GC-resistant isolates, respectively. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis conducted on 3GC- and fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates showed three indistinguishable PFGE patterns from cefotaxime-resistant isolates recovered at farm and from two preevisceration carcass swabs. Although the prevalence of resistance declined between initial farm fecal samples and final carcass swabs, resistant bacteria recovered from carcasses illustrate the potential transmission of AMR to the human food supply.
