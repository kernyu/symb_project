Black rot of sweet potato caused by pathogenic fungus Ceratocystis fimbriata severely deteriorates both growth of plants and post-harvest storage. Antimicrobial peptides from various organisms have broad range activities of killing bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi. Plant thionin peptide exhibited anti-fungal activity against C. fimbriata. A gene for barley alpha-hordothionin (alphaHT) was placed downstream of a strong constitutive promoter of E12Omega or the promoter of a sweet potato gene for beta-amylase of storage roots, and introduced into sweet potato commercial cultivar Kokei No. 14. Transgenic E12Omega:alphaHT plants showed high-level expression of alphaHT mRNA in both leaves and storage roots. Transgenic beta-Amy:alphaHT plants showed sucrose-inducible expression of alphaHT mRNA in leaves, in addition to expression in storage roots. Leaves of E12Omega:alphaHT plants exhibited reduced yellowing upon infection by C. fimbriata compared to leaves of non-transgenic Kokei No. 14, although the level of resistance was weaker than resistance cultivar Tamayutaka. Storage roots of both E12Omega:alphaHT and beta-Amy:alphaHT plants exhibited reduced lesion areas around the site inoculated with C. fimbriata spores compared to Kokei No. 14, and some of the transgenic lines showed resistance level similar to Tamayutaka. Growth of plants and production of storage roots of these transgenic plants were not significantly different from non-transgenic plants. These results highlight the usefulness of transgenic sweet potato expressing antimicrobial peptide to reduce damages of sweet potato from the black rot disease and to reduce the use of agricultural chemicals.
