We analyse the diversity of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), antibiotic resistance genes, and plasmid content among Escherichia coli from a community and a hospital setting in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. ESBL producers (CTX-M-2, CTX-M-9, CTX-M-59) belonged to different phylogroups/sequence types, and bla(CTX-M) were identified in IncA/C plasmids, reinforcing the possible intraplasmid evolution of bla(CTX-M-59) from bla(CTX-M-2) and the implication of IncA/C on bla(CTX-M) spread.
