P128 is an antistaphylococcal protein, comprising a cell wall-degrading enzymatic region and a Staphylococcus-specific binding region, which possesses specific and potent bactericidal activity against sensitive and drug-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus To explore P128's ability to kill S. aureus in a range of environments relevant to clinical infection, we investigated the anti-S. aureus activity of P128 alone and in combination with standard-of-care antibiotics on planktonic and biofilm-embedded cells. P128 was found to have potent antibiofilm activity on preformed S. aureus biofilms as detected by CFU reduction and a colorimetric minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration (MBIC) assay. Scanning electron microscopic images of biofilms formed on the surfaces of microtiter plates and on catheters showed that P128 at low concentrations could destroy the biofilm structure and lyse the cells. When it was tested in combination with antibiotics which are known to be poor inhibitors of S. aureus in biofilms, such as vancomycin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, linezolid, and daptomycin, P128 showed highly synergistic antibiofilm activity that resulted in much reduced MBIC values for P128 and the individual antibiotics. The synergistic effect was seen for both sensitive and resistant isolates of S. aureus Additionally, in an in vitro mixed-biofilm model mimicking the wound infection environment, P128 was able to prevent biofilm formation by virtue of its anti-Staphylococcus activity. The potent S. aureus biofilm-inhibiting activity of P128 both alone and in combination with antibiotics is an encouraging sign for the development of P128 for treatment of complicated S. aureus infections involving biofilms.
