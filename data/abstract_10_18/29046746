Non-neoformans Cryptococcus species, including C. laurentii and C. albidus, have historically been classified as exclusively saprophytic. However, recent studies have increasingly implicated these organisms as the causative agent of opportunistic infections in humans. Herein, the case is presented of C. laurentii meningitis in a critically ill patient receiving corticosteroids. C. laurentii has been implicated in an additional 18 cases of opportunistic infection, predominantly of the skin, bloodstream, and central nervous system. The most clinically significant risk factors for non-neoformans cryptococcal infections include: impaired cell-mediated immunity, recent corticosteroid use, and invasive catheter placement. This article provides a comprehensive review of the clinical relevance, pathogenesis, risk factors, and treatment of non-neoformans Cryptococcus species.
