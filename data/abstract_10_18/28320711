Virulence plasmids and antibiotic resistance plasmids are usually maintained separately in Salmonella spp.; however, we report an instance of a hybrid plasmid (pN13-01125) in Salmonella enterica serovar Dublin. Review of the complete sequence of the 172,265-bp plasmid suggests that pN13-01125 is comprised of the previously described pSDVr and pSH696_135 plasmids and that the mechanism of hybridization likely involves IS6 (IS26) insertion sequence elements. The plasmid has a low conjugation frequency, confers resistance to six classes of antimicrobials, and contains a complete spv virulence operon.
