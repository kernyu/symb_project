Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) is an increasing global threat. Here, we describe the prevalence and impact of tigecycline use in a cohort of patients with CRKP bacteriuria nested within a multicentre, prospective study. In the 21-month study period, 260 unique patients were included. Tigecycline was given to 80 (31%) patients. The use of tigecycline during the index hospitalization was significantly associated with the subsequent development of tigecycline resistance in the same patient (OR, 6.13; 95% CI, 1.15-48.65; p 0.03). In conclusion, the use of tigecycline with CRKP bacteriuria is common, and is associated with the subsequent development of tigecycline resistance.
