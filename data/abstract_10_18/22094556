Staphylococcus aureus is the leading cause of infection in orthopedic implants and of osteomyelitis consequent to it. Here we focus on the wide array of virulence factors that endow S. aureus with its abilities to colonize peri-prosthesis tissues and to attack and damage them. Following an infective strategy orchestrated by agr locus, Staphylococcus aureus first deploys virulence factors for adhesion to the prosthesis and peri-prosthesis tissues and then launches its attack by delivering destructive factors.
