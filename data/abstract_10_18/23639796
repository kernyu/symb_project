Among 82 clinical isolates of the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex recovered in 13 hospitals of Sichuan, China, in 2011, 13 were Acinetobacter pittii and 2 were Acinetobacter nosocomialis. Multilocus sequence typing revealed a novel sequence type (ST) of A. nosocomialis and 7 novel STs of A. pittii. Most isolates were hospital-acquired and colonized in the respiratory tract, while 6 cases with pneumonia due to A. pittii were identified. This study provided a snapshot of the local incidence of A. pittii and A. nosocomialis.
