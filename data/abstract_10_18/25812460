The inappropriate use of antibiotics has severe global health and economic consequences, including the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. A major driver of antibiotic misuse is the inability to accurately distinguish between bacterial and viral infections based on currently available diagnostic solutions. A multifaceted 'omics' approach that integrates personalized patient data such as genetic predisposition to infections (genomics), natural microbiota composition and immune response to infection (proteomics and transcriptomics) together with comprehensive pathogen profiling has the potential to help physicians improve their antimicrobial prescribing practices. In this respect, the EU has funded a multidisciplinary project (TAILORED-Treatment) that will develop novel omics-based personalized treatment schemes that have the potential to reduce antibiotic consumption, and help limiting the spread of antibiotic resistance.
