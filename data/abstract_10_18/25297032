In India, extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) accounts for 10 - 15% of all types of tuberculosis. To identify and compare predominant spoligotypes and drug-resistance patterns in strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from extrapulmonary and pulmonary specimens in central India, drug susceptibility testing and spoligotyping were carried out. Spoligotyping data was analyzed using SITVIT2 database. ST11/EAI3_Ind with 33% isolates among extrapulmonary specimens and ST26/CAS1_DEL with 28% isolates among pulmonary specimens were the most predominant lineages. Multidrug resistance was found in 5.5% of the strains isolated from extrapulmonary specimens in contrast to 17% isolated from pulmonary specimens.
