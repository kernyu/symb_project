N-phosphonium chitosans (NPCSs) with different degrees of substitution (3%, 13% and 21%) were synthesized and evaluated as novel polymeric antibacterial agents. Their antibacterial activities compared with hydroxypropyltrimethyl ammonium chloride chitosan (HACC), parent chitosan and (5-carboxypentyl) triphenylphosphonium bromide (CTPB) were tested against Escherichia coli and two strains of drug-resistance Staphylococcus aureus by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and biofilm prevention assays. The results show that the NPCS with 3% or 13% substitution has lower MIC and MBC values and stronger ability to inhibit biofilm formation of all the three bacteria than HACC, chitosan and CTPB. In addition, the antibacterial activity of NPCSs increases with their substitution decreasing from 21% to 3%. Overall, the antibacterial activity of NPCS with 3% or 13% substitution is better than that of NPCS with 21% substitution, HACC with 22% substitution, chitosan and CTPB. It can be considered that NPCS with appropriate degree of substitution has favorable antibacterial activity and is a potential polymeric antibacterial agent.
