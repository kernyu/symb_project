Bacterial infections were once a major obstacle to the treatment of acute leukaemia. Improvement in management strategies, including the use of broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs targeting Gram-negative bacteria, has reduced the mortality in neutropenic patients developing blood stream infections and other severe infections. In many countries these achievements are threatened by development of multi-resistant bacteria, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. This review addresses the epidemiology, clinical importance and possible management of these multi-resistant organisms.
