Multidrug resistant enterococci are major causes of nosocomial infections. Prior therapy with cephalosporins increases the risk of developing an enterococcal infection due to the intrinsic resistance of enterococci to these antibiotics. While progress has been made toward understanding the genetic and biochemical mechanisms of cephalosporin resistance, available data indicate that as-yet-unidentified resistance factors must exist. Here, we describe results of a screen to identify small molecules capable of sensitizing enterococci to broad-spectrum cephalosporins. We found that both Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium were sensitized to broad and expanded-spectrum cephalosporins when thymidylate production was impaired, whether by direct inhibition of thymidylate synthase, or by limiting production of cofactors required for its activity. Cephalosporin potentiation is the result of altered exopolysaccharide production due to reduced dTDP-glucose synthesis. Hence, exopolysaccharide production is a previously undescribed contributor to the intrinsic cephalosporin resistance of enterococci and serves as a new target for antienterococcal therapeutics.
