BACKGROUND: The antimicrobial resistance capability of Helicobacter pylori is one of the critical factors in the failure to treat this pathogen. The purpose of this study was to investigate the changing pattern of primary antibiotic resistance rates in children in the southern central part of South Korea from 1990 to 2009. METHODS: H. pylori strains were isolated from children who had undergone upper endoscopy at Gyeongsang National University Hospital, including 58 children from 1990-1994 and 33 children from 2005-2009. The susceptibility of H. pylori strains to erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, amoxicillin, tetracycline, metronidazole, furazolidone, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and rifabutin was tested using the serial twofold agar dilution method. RESULTS: The resistance rate to erythromycin increased significantly from 13.8% in 1990-1994 to 33.3% in 2005-2009 (P = 0.032). Clarithromycin resistance increased from 6.9% to 18.2%. Metronidazole resistance decreased from 32.8% to 27.3%. The minimum inhibitory concentration of azithromycin and erythromycin showed definite shifts to higher concentrations in 2005-2009 compared with the strains sampled in 1990-1994 (P = 0.021 and P = 0.025, respectively). The frequency of both macrolide- and metronidazole-resistant strains was 13.8% in 1990-1994 and 15.2% in 2005-2009. No associations were detected between multidrug-resistant strains and the two study periods. CONCLUSIONS: The antibiotic resistance rates of H. pylori in Jinju had a different pattern to other regions. The antibiotic resistance rates of H. pylori showed geographic variation, and local data should be provided as a guideline for treating H. pylori infection.
