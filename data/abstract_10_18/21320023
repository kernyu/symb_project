INTRODUCTION: The use of artemisinin combination therapies to treat uncomplicated malaria is growing and, therefore, so is the number of children exposed to these agents. As a result, there is a huge drive to develop paediatric formulations. However, relatively limited data exist regarding the pharmacokinetic properties of these drugs in this vulnerable population. AREAS COVERED: The article reviews the pharmacokinetic data for artemisinin drugs used for the treatment of malaria in paediatric populations. The authors discuss how developmental and environmental factors can produce significant variation in the pharmacokinetic properties of artemisinin drugs. The authors also discuss how this variation may lead to suboptimal therapeutic drug concentrations with implications on efficacy, safety and the development of parasite resistance to these drugs. EXPERT OPINION: There is currently a lack of published studies on the pharmacokinetics of artemisinin drugs in children and this subject is complicated by several interdependent variables. Therefore, the construction of a systems-based model of this subject should be a priority area in order to identify gaps in current knowledge to ensure their continued effective and safe use.
