PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of fluoroquinolone-based antibacterial ophthalmic solutions on cell proliferation in vitro and corneal wound healing in vivo. METHODS: Staten's Serum institute rabbit corneal cells were exposed to phosphate-buffered saline, 1.5% and 0.5% levofloxacin, 0.5% moxifloxacin, and 0.3% gatifloxacin, for 2 min, following which the cells were incubated without the drug. The cell viability was evaluated after 24 or 72 h of incubation. Rabbit corneal epithelial abrasion models created using n-heptanol were instilled with saline or fluoroquinolone-based solutions 7 times at 30-min intervals, following which corneal epithelial wound healing was evaluated from 30 min to 48 h by the measurement of electrical corneal resistance (CR) ratios. RESULTS: The cell viability decreased over time; the lowest values were observed with 1.5% levofloxacin. Significant differences in cell viability were observed among the 4 solutions at 72 h (P<0.05); the cell viabilities of 1.5% and 0.5% levofloxacin, 0.5% moxifloxacin, and 0.3% gatifloxacin were 21.6%, 97.9%, 39.1%, and 67.5%, respectively. The electrical CR ratios at 48 h after instillation were 103.8% (saline), 78.2% (1.5% levofloxacin), 105.0% (0.5% levofloxacin), 74.9% (0.5% moxifloxacin), and 87.7% (0.3% gatifloxacin); the difference was significant between 1.5% levofloxacin or 0.5% moxifloxacin and saline (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The cytotoxicities of 1.5% and 0.5% levofloxacin, 0.5% moxifloxacin, and 0.3% gatifloxacin were different, and 1.5% levofloxacin and 0.5% moxifloxacin resulted in delayed corneal wound healing. The results suggest that 1.5% levofloxacin exerts the greatest influence on corneal wound healing.
