Background. According to the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network, Romania reports an increasing number of resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strains from invasive infections every year. Material and Method. We analyzed the antimicrobial susceptibility of Klebsiella pneumoniae strains isolated from blood in 2010 and 2015 in "Matei Bals" National Institute of Infectious Diseases, in order to identify any significant changes in the last five years. Results. We identified 18 strains in 2010 and 37 strains in 2015. Although the resistance to aminopenicillin-betalactamase inhibitors association, piperacillin-tazobactam, third generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, gentamicin, amikacin and the combined resistance decreased between these two time frames, this evolution was statistically non-significant. The same was noticed for the increased resistance rates to carbapenems. Conclusions. Antimicrobial resistance of Klebsiella pneumoniae may become a major problem for the public health and the hospital-acquired infections control. Therefore, it needs further monitoring and efforts must be made in order to limit the increase of the resistance.
