The aim of the present report was to evaluate antimicrobial/anti-biofilm activity of 7-(2-oxohexyl)-taxodione, a novel taxodione derivative isolated from n-hexane extract of Salvia austriaca hairy roots. Antimicrobial assays showed that 7-(2-oxohexyl)-taxodione was at least 4 times more active than taxodione against methicillin-susceptible as well against methicillin-resistant staphylococci with MIC of 1.25-2.5 mugml(-1). This compound was less active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), on the same level as taxodione (MIC ranged 10.0-20.0 mugml(-1)). The presence of 7-(2-oxohexyl)-taxodione in the culture medium (at MIC, (1/2) MIC or (1/4) MIC) decreased adhesion of staphylococci to abiotic surfaces, which in turn caused a reduction in biofilm formation during 24h, by approximately 25-30%. Also, the extent of established biofilm eradication was found to be significant, although it required an increased concentration of the compound. This is the first report on the antimicrobial activity of this, up to now not known compound, isolated from transformed roots of S. austriaca.
