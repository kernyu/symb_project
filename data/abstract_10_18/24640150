The use of reamberin for prophylaxis of side effects was estimated in 257 patients with tuberculosis of the respiratory organs under the chemotherapy. The reference group involved 241 patients treated with the chemotherapeutics alone. Reamberin in the treatment of the patients, including subjects with multidrug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis, promoted a 2-fold decrease in the frequency of the intoxication syndrome during the first month of the treatment. Adverse reactions (toxic, allergic) to the antituberculosis chemotherapeuties were 2.4 times less frequent in the patients additionally treated with reamberin. Positive effect of reamberin on the activity of AIAT and AsAT was observed, the effect being higher, when the pathogen was susceptible to the drugs.
