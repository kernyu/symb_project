Antibacterial peptides, magainin I and nisin were covalently bound to stainless steel surfaces. Several procedures of surface functionalisation processes have been investigated and optimized, each step being characterized by polarization modulation reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (PM-RAIRS) and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS). Grafting of antibacterial peptides was successfully achieved by a 3 steps functionalisation process on a chitosan polymeric layer. The antibacterial activity of the anchored magainin and nisin was tested against a gram-positive bacteria, Listeria ivanovii, i.e., the possible survival and attachment of this bacteria, was characterized on modified stainless steel surfaces. The results revealed that the adsorbed peptides reduced the adhesion of bacteria on the functionalised stainless steel surface.
