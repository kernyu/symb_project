Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an increasing cause of serious infection, both in the community and hospital settings. Despite sophisticated strategies and efforts, the antibiotic options for treating MRSA infection have been narrowed due to the limited number of newly developed antimicrobials. Herein, we analyze the completely sequenced genome of a novel virulent phage YMC/09/04/R1988 MRSA BP as a potential alternative anti-MRSA agent, which lysed clinical isolates from a patient admitted to the hospital due to hip disarticulation. The phage contains a linear double-stranded DNA genome of 44,459 bp in length, with 33.37% GC content, 62 predicted open reading frames (ORFs), and annotated functions of only 23 ORFs that are associated with structural assembly, host lysis, DNA replication, and modification. It showed a broad host range (17 of 30 strains) against MRSA strains in clinical isolates. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
