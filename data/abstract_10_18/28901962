Polymer prodrugs can considerably improve the treatment of tumors with multidrug resistance, often caused by overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Here, we present the effect of the N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide-based polymer conjugate with P-gp inhibitor ritonavir (RIT) on the increase of free doxorubicin (DOX) and polymer-bound DOX cytotoxicity in the human neuroblastoma 4 cell line and its resistant clones to different cytostatics. The increase in cytotoxicity after polymer-RIT conjugate pretreatment was higher for the lines overexpressing P-gp and less pronounced for those with decreased P-gp levels. Moreover, the effect of polymer conjugate containing inhibitor and DOX on the same polymer chain was lower than that of two individual polymer conjugates used sequentially. In conclusion, the polymer-RIT conjugate can significantly increase the cytotoxicity of free DOX and polymer-DOX conjugates in cells with various multidrug resistance origins and can thus be considered a suitable therapeutic enhancer of polymer prodrugs.
