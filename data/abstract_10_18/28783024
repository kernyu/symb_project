AIMS: To determine the prevalence of nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae in healthy children aged 0-6 years who were vaccinated with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 150 healthy Turkish children between 1 month and 6 years of age. Serotyping was performed and risk factors of carriage were evaluated. RESULTS: The overall carriage rate was 14%. Vaccine type serotypes were determined in 17 (12.6%) children who received full-dose PCV13 vaccine. The highest carriage rate was observed among children younger than 24 months (76.2%). In multivariate analysis, respiratory infection in recent months, age, attendance at a day-care center and antibiotic usage were not statistically significant risk factors for carriage. Overall, S. pneumoniae strains were considered as penicillin susceptible and antimicrobial resistance was limited. CONCLUSION: We observed a low rate of pneumococcal carriage in children after PCV13 implementation compared with that of children receiving PCV7. Although it was reduced, vaccine serotype colonization in PCV13-vaccinated children remains persistent.
