As a growing number of therapeutic antibodies are developed, robust methods to efficiently improve the affinity and/or specificity of antibody candidates are needed. Here we describe our powerful platform that combines scFv affinity maturation and IgG high-throughput screening. After creating diversity with our random mutagenesis technology (MutaGen), the scFv libraries are fully cleaned using a fusion system introducing the beta-lactamase gene to select in-frame and stop codon free variants on the basis of ampicillin resistance. The high-quality scFv libraries thereby constructed are then selected on the target in vitro using phage display technology. Contrary to standard procedures, instead of producing a limited number of affinity matured scFv as IgG molecules, we developed a cloning system to directly transfer the entire pool of selected scFv into an IgG expression vector permitting rapid IgG small-scale production (96 wells) in mammalian cells. Our integrated process allows us to generate high-quality scFv libraries and test numerous IgG variants, increasing the chances to select the best therapeutic antibody candidate.
