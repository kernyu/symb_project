Interferon alpha (IFN) induces variable responses in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), with 8-30% of early chronic phase cases achieving a complete cytogenetic response. We hypothesized that polymorphic differences in genes encoding IFN signal transduction components might account for different patient responses. We studied 174 IFN-treated patients, of whom 79 achieved less than 35% Philadelphia-chromosome (Ph) positive metaphases (responders) and 95 failed to show any cytogenetic response (more than 95% Ph-positive metaphases; non-responders). We compared 17 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at IFNAR1, IFNAR2, JAK1, TYK2, STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5a/b between the two groups and found a significant difference for rs6503691, a SNP tightly linked to STAT5a, STAT5b and STAT3 (minor allele frequency 0.16 for non-responders; 0.06 for responders, P=0.007). Levels of STAT3 mRNA correlated with rs6503691 genotype (P<0.001) as assessed by real time quantitative PCR and therefore we conclude that rs6503691 is associated with the STAT3 expression levels and response of CML patients to IFN.
