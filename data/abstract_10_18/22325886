Effects of transgenic expression of dual positional maize lipoxygenase-1 on the defense system were analyzed in rice. The activities of hydroperoxidelyase and antioxidative enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase) were increased and high levels of aldehydes including malondialdehyde were produced. The constitutive level of jasmonic was slightly increased and the constitutive salicylic acid level was decreased. Kinetic analysis of wound response indicated that the levels of jasmonic acid and salicylic acid are inversely correlated in nully transgenic rice plants, suggesting that there is an antagonistic interaction between jasmonic acid and salicylic acid. Microarray analysis indicated that several defense-related genes encoding antioxidative enzymes and pathogen-related proteins were up-regulated, and the resistance to rice blast fungus was enhanced in transgenic rice. Taken together, our results suggest that maize lipoxygenase-1 expressed in the cytoplasm plays an important role for the regulation of defense system including the antioxidative enzymes in transgenic rice, and that these effects may be mediated by reactive oxygen species generated through the enzyme-initiated catalytic peroxidation mechanism of maize lipoxygenase-1.
