In an effort to develop new inhibitors of metallo-beta-lactamases (MbetaLs), twenty-eight azolylthioacetamides were synthesized and assayed against MbetaLs. The obtained benzimidazolyl and benzioxazolyl substituted 1-19 specifically inhibited the enzyme ImiS, and 10 was found to be the most potent inhibitor of ImiS with an IC50 value of 15nM. The nitrobenzimidazolyl substituted 20-28 specifically inhibited NDM-1, with 27 being the most potent inhibitor with an IC50 value of 170nM. Further studies with 10, 11, and 27 revealed a mixed inhibition mode with competitive and uncompetitive inhibition constants in a similar range as the IC50 values. These inhibitors resulted in a 2-4-fold decrease in imipenem MIC values using E. coli cells producing ImiS or NDM-1. While the source of uncompetitive (possibly allosteric) inhibition remains unclear, docking studies indicate that 10 and 11 may interact orthosterically with Zn2 in the active site of CphA, while 27 could bridge the two Zn(II) ions in the active site of NDM-1 via its nitro group.
