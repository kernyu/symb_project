In general, new technologies usually increase laboratory costs due to the need for an initial investment. However, as occurred with MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight) mass spectrometry, this increase is subsequently offset by the discontinued use of traditional technologies and by the benefits to patients of the new information generated. In the clinical microbiology laboratory, the identification time is reduced with the use of MALDI-TOF (by at least 24 hours) and turnaround is improved, allowing faster production of the microbiological report. This beneficial effect has mainly been studied with blood cultures in patients with bacteraemia. In these patients, the length of hospital stay has been reduced by 1.6-6.6 days, depending on the type of patient and the appropriateness of treatment. This leads to better antimicrobial use and a reduction in total hospital cost of up to 43% per patient. Another factor that has been analysed is the decrease in mortality due to better management of antimicrobial therapy. Future multicentre studies should include other factors such as hospital organisation changes and clinical activity arising in response to the efforts of the clinical microbiology laboratory to rapidly obtain information of clinical value.
