Opportunistic infections remain a major problem across a broad spectrum of immunocompromised haematological patient groups, with viruses, bacteria, fungi and protozoa all presenting significant challenges. Given the major difficulties in treating many of these infections with the currently available antimicrobial chemotherapeutic arsenal, and the rapid emergence of antimicrobial resistance amongst all of the microbial kingdoms, novel strategies that enable host control or elimination of infection are urgently required. Recently, major progress has been made in our understanding of host immunocompromise in the haematological patient. In addition, a wide range of novel immunomodulatory strategies for infectious diseases have been developed. Here we discuss the major and wide-ranging areas of progress that have been made for host-directed immunotherapies in the context of infectious diseases, with relevance to haematological immunocompromise.
