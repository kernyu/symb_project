BACKGROUND AND METHOD: Surgical infection remains a main cause of death after heart surgery, despite advances in pharmacological therapy. Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic, useful in gram-positive organisms resistant to standard treatment, including vancomycin. The aim of this study was to describe the use of daptomycin regarding efficacy, efficiency and safety in patients with gram-positive infections after heart surgery using a retrospective analysis on 49 adult patients. CONCLUSION: Daptomycin shows excellent in vitro and in vivo activity against gram-positive organisms, such as Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, especially MRSA. Daptomycin is also effective against increasing vancomycin-resistant or vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus.
