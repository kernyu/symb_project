Staphylococcus aureus is the leading cause of many human infectious diseases. Besides infectious dangers, S. aureus is well-known for the quickly developed drug resistance. Although great efforts have been made, mechanisms underlying the antibiotic effects of S. aureus are still not well clarified. Recently, reports have shown that oxidative stress connects with bactericidal antibiotics [Dwyer et al. (2009) Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 12: , 482-489]. Based on this point, we demonstrate that reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by sublethal vancomycin may be partly responsible for the antibiotic resistance in heterogeneous vancomycin resistant S. aureus (hVRSA). Sublethal vancomycin treatment may induce protective ROS productions in hVRSA, whereas reduction in ROS level in hVRSA strains may increase their vancomycin susceptibility. Moreover, low dose of ROS in VSSA (vancomycin susceptible S. aureus) strains may promote their survival under vancomycin conditions. Our findings reveal that modest ROS generation may be protective for vancomycin resistance in hVRSA. These results recover novel insights into the relationship between oxidative stress and bacterial resistance, which has important applications for further use of antibiotics and development of therapeutics strategies for hVRSA.
