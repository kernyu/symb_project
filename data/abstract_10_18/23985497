The Bacteroides fragilis group consists of species of obligate anaerobic bacteria that inhabit the human gut. They are among the leading pathogens isolated in the setting of intra-abdominal infections. B. fragilis strains, especially in the United States, are virtually always susceptible to metronidazole, carbapenems, and beta-lactam antibiotics. Although isolated cases of resistance to single agents have been reported, multidrug-resistant (MDR) B. fragilis strains are exceptionally rare. In May 2013, an MDR B. fragilis strain was isolated from the bloodstream and intra-abdominal abscesses of a patient who had recently received health care in India. This is only the second published case of MDR B. fragilis in the United States. This report summarizes the case and highlights the need for awareness of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) in returning travelers who have received inpatient medical care outside the United States, both for timely implementation of proper infection control measures and to ensure administration of appropriate antimicrobials.
