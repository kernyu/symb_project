Tenofovir disoproxyl fumarate is a known cause of kidney tubular dysfunction in HIV-infected patients. Recent studies reported significant association between specific allelic variants in ABCC2, ABCC4 and/or ABCC10 genes and the development of kidney tubular dysfunction in HIV-infected adults. We describe the first 2 cases of vertically HIV-infected patients affected by kidney tubular dysfunction associated with polymorphisms in the ABCC genes.
