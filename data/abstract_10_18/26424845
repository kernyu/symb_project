Vancomycin-variable enterococcus (VVE) is an emerging pathogen. VVE isolates initially appear phenotypically susceptible to vancomycin but possesses the vanA gene and can develop in vitro and in vivo resistance to vancomycin. We report a case of VVE bacteremia and describe how VVE poses diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas.
