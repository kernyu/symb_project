BACKGROUND: Whereas street vended foods are readily available sources of meals for many people across the world, the microbial safety of such food is always uncertain. In developing countries the major sources of food-borne illnesses are street vended foods. The aim of this study was thus to assess the prevalence and antibiogram of bacteria from white lupin in Bahir Dar Town. METHODS: A total of 40 samples were processed for detection of indicator bacteria and pathogens from December, 2011 to February, 2012 using standard bacteriological techniques. Antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. RESULTS: The total coliform counts were 954.2+/-385 and 756.2+/-447.3 at the surface and the core of white lupin, respectively. On the other hand, the fecal coliform counts were 880.9+/-396.6 and 662.1+/-461.9 at surface and the core, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference in total colifoms and fecal coliform counts between the surface and core of white lupin (p <0.05). Escherichia coli 29 (72.5%), Salmonella spp. 23 (57.5%) and Shigella spp. 8 (20%) were the pathogens isolated. Most bacterial isolates were resistant to tetracycline, cotriamoxazole and erythromycin whereas many of them were sensitive to chloramphenicol, nalidixic acid, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin. The overall multiple antimicrobial resistances rate was 75%. CONCLUSION: This study revealed contamination of white lupin and a potential health to consumers, and the bacteria isolated showed high rates of multiple drug resistance. Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance should be done on food borne pathogens. In addition, further studies should be conducted on the bacteriological quality of waters used for soaking white lupin.
