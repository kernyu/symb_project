Ceftaroline is a novel cephalosporin recently approved in children for treatment of acute bacterial skin and soft tissue infections and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and other susceptible bacteria. With a favorable tolerability profile and efficacy proven in pediatric patients and excellent in vitro activity against resistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, ceftaroline may serve as a therapeutic option for polymicrobial infections, CABP caused by penicillin- and ceftriaxone-resistant S. pneumoniae and resistant Gram-positive infections that fail first-line antimicrobial agents. However, limited data are available on tolerability in neonates and infants younger than 2 months of age, and on pharmacokinetic characteristics in children with chronic medical conditions and those with invasive, complicated infections. In this review, the microbiological profile of ceftaroline, its mechanism of action, and pharmacokinetic profile will be presented. Additionally, clinical evidence for use in pediatric patients and proposed place in therapy is discussed.
