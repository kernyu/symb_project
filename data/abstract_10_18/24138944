A phase I study utilizing decitabine (DAC) followed by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, rapamycin, in patients with relapsed/refractory adult AML was undertaken to assess safety and feasibility. Patients received DAC 20mg/m(2) intravenously daily for 5 days followed by rapamycin from day 6 to day 25 at doses of 2 mg, 4 mg, and 6 mg/day in a standard 3+3 dose escalation design. Twelve patients completed treatment for safety evaluation. Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached, and except for grade 3 mucositis in 4 patients, no other significant unexpected non-hematologic toxicities have occurred indicating safety of this regimen. This trial is registered at clinical trials.gov as NCT00861874.
