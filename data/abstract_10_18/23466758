OBJECTIVES: To identify the common bacteria of otorhinolaryngological (ORL) infection in three general hospitals in the state of Sarawak, East Malaysia and to determine the antibiotic sensitivity of the common bacteria to update local antibiotic policy. METHODS: All specimens with positive monoclonal culture, received from inpatient and outpatient Otorhinolaryngology Department in the year 2009 and 2010 were included in the study. Patients' demographics, nature of specimens, bacterial isolates and antibiotic sensitivity were analysed by using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). RESULTS: A total 244 positive monoclonal cultures were identified. Staphylococcus species and Gram negative bacilli were the commonest bacteria of ORL infections. Common ORL bacteria remain sensitive to our front line antibiotics. There are a number of multi-drug resistant isolates of MRSA, ESBL Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumanii in the hospital-acquired infections. CONCLUSION: Although resistance to antimicrobial agents is growing worldwide, first line antibiotics still show significant therapeutic advantage in our local setting. The low resistance of bacterial isolates in our community reflects judicious use of antibiotics in our routine clinical practices.
