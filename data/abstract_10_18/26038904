Staphylococcus aureus is a known major cause of foodborne illnesses, and raw milk and dairy products are often contaminated by enterotoxigenic and antimicrobial-resistant S. aureus strains. In the present study, 35 S. aureus strains were isolated from 383 raw milk samples collected from various dairy herds in the province of Milan (northern Italy). The isolates were characterized based on their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and the presence of genes encoding staphylococcal enterotoxins (sea, seb, sec, sed, and see). About half (45.7%) of the strains were enterotoxigenic, and 37.1% were resistant to at least one of the antimicrobial drugs tested. Seven (20%) of 35 isolates were identified as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and SCCmec typing performed with a multiplex PCR assay revealed the presence of gene cassettes IV and V, typical of community-acquired MRSA, and I and II, characteristic of health care-associated MRSA. The MRSA strains were evaluated for the presence of the Panton-Valentine leukocidin gene, but this gene was not found. The results of the present study revealed the presence of toxin-producing S. aureus and MRSA strains in raw milk. MRSA and enterotoxigenic S. aureus in dairy farms are an important risk factor for the spread of staphylococcal infections; therefore, further studies are needed to find strategies for monitoring and controlling the presence of S. aureus, especially MRSA, in dairy products.
