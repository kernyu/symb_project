BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Visceral fat obesity plays an essential role in the clustering of cardiovascular risk factors. This study aimed to clarify the effects of miglitol, alpha-glycosidase inhibitor, on body weight, fat distribution and cardiovascular risk factors in patients with the metabolic syndrome. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and eleven drug naive patients with the metabolic syndrome were continuously recruited and randomly allocated to a group of life style modification (LSM) alone or a group of LSM with miglitol per os 50 mg x 3 (LSM+miglitol). After 12 weeks of treatment, body weight (5.1%), body mass index (4.9%) and waist circumference were greatly reduced in miglitol group (n=42) than in LSM group (n=43). Plasma levels of insulin and glucose during an oral 75 g glucose loading were decreased only in miglitol group. Visceral fat area, determined by abdominal computed tomography, was greatly reduced in miglitol group (baseline 188 vs 12 weeks 161 cm(2), p<0.0001) than in LSM group (184 vs 174 cm(2), p<0.05). Subcutaneous fat area was reduced only in miglitol group (p<0.001). Systolic blood pressure was reduced in miglitol group (142 vs 133 mm Hg, p<0.001), but not in control group (137 vs 134 mm Hg). Serum levels of triglyceride, LDL-cholesterol, gamma-GTP, and high-sensitive CRP were decreased and adiponectin was increased only in miglitol group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that miglitol showed an anti-obesity potential, which was achieved by reducing abdominal fat accumulation and/or enhanced insulin requirement, and then corrected both the metabolic and hemodynamic aberrations seen in patients with the metabolic syndrome (UMIN Clinical Trial Registry UMIN000007650).
