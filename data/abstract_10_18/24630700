Multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms in ventilator-associated pneumonia were found in 49 of 107 patients and were associated with home antibiotics, pre-ventilator-associated pneumonia hospital stay, and health care exposure. Overall, MDR organisms were associated with increased mortality (P = .006). On multivariate analysis, MDR status was modulated by organism class. In nonfermenting gram-negative rods, no association between MDR and mortality was found, but, in all other organisms, MDR was associated with increased mortality risk (hazard ratio, 6.15; 95% confidence interval: 1.80-21.05, P = .004).
