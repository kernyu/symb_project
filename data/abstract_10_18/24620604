Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are emerging microbial hazards threatening human health. Many factors, including urban and agricultural activities and water environment changes, can significantly impact the variations of ARGs. An investigation on the occurrence and variations of ARGs in the Jiulong River was done in this study. The water samples were collected from 16 sites ranging from the upper branch to the river mouth of the Jiulong River, in both low- and high-flow periods. Eleven ARG families were tested and quantified by real-time PCR (SYBR Green) methods, and detection assays were conducted for tetA, tetG, aacC1, strA, ermB, cmlA5, vanA, dfrA1, sulll, blaTEM-1 and blaoxa-1 genes. Results showed that nine ARG families were found, then the swine industry and urban activities, including sewage discharge, might be responsible for the high levels of concentrations and relative abundances of ARGs, and the increase of salinity might decrease the relative abundances of ARGs. In addition, some ARG abundances were significantly correlated to the concentrations of NH4+ and PO4(3-), particularly in the high-flow period. The human activities were important sources for ARGs in the Jiulong River, which have already become a threat to the safety of drinking water for the nearby cities.
