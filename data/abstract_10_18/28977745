The eight enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of the three branched-chain amino acids (l-isoleucine, l-leucine, and l-valine) were identified decades ago using classical genetic approaches based on amino acid auxotrophy. This review will highlight the recent progress in the determination of the three-dimensional structures of these enzymes, their chemical mechanisms, and insights into their suitability as targets for the development of antibacterial agents. Given the enormous rise in bacterial drug resistance to every major class of antibacterial compound, there is a clear and present need for the identification of new antibacterial compounds with nonoverlapping targets to currently used antibacterials that target cell wall, protein, mRNA, and DNA synthesis.
