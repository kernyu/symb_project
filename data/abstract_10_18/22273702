Preoperative diagnosis of periprosthetic infections is particularly important before revision of knee and hip arthroplasties because of the therapeutic consequences. Therefore, periprosthetic infections should be ruled out before any revision surgery is performed. Of the different diagnostic methods direct techniques which allow the direct detection of microorganisms with testing of antibiotic sensitivity are recommended. This allows microorganism-specific systemic and local antibiotic therapies and helps to reduce the risk of development of resistance. In our studies it could be shown that the time for incubation to detect microorganisms should be 14 days and that biopsy of periprosthetic tissues is superior to aspiration alone because it combines several diagnostic methods (microbiological and histological). It is preferable to repeating an aspiration when data are unclear, i.e. in cases of potentially false positives or negatives results of aspiration.
