BACKGROUND: Some difficult cases of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (NS) have been treated with a HIV protease inhibitor provided with proteasome-inhibiting activity. The objective of this study was to limit nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation which is up-regulated in these patients, aiming at decreasing proteinuria and prednisone need. METHODS: Ten cases with long-lasting (up to 15 years) history of NS with steroid dependence (six cases, of which three with secondary steroid resistance) or resistance to steroids (four cases) unsuccessfully treated with multiple immunosuppressive drugs, accepted a treatment with the protease inhibitor saquinavir. p50/p65 NF-kappaB nuclear localization and immunoproteasome/proteasome messenger RNA (mRNA) were monitored in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The effects of saquinavir on NF-kappaB nuclear localization in cultured PBMCs and in immortalized human podocytes were assessed. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 14.7 months (6-68.7), 1/4 primary steroid-resistant NS (SRNS) and 5/6 steroid-dependent NS or secondary SRNS became infrequent (5) or frequent (1) relapsers, with 63% prednisone reduction (from 25.3 to 8.4 mg/kg/month, P = 0.015). Saquinavir was effective in association with low doses of calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine 2 mg/kg/day or tacrolimus 0.01-0.06 mg/kg/day). No side effects were observed apart from transitory mild diarrhoea. In PBMCs, NF-kappaB was down-regulated, while MECL-1 immunoproteasome/beta2 proteasome mRNA ratio was reversed to normal values. In culture, saquinavir blunted NF-kappaB activation in human podocytes and in PBMCs. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, a HIV antiprotease drug reduced proteinuria and had a steroid-sparing effect in some multidrug-resistant/-dependent NS. This observation warrants further investigation.
