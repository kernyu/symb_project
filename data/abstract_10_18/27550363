Despite current prophylactic strategies, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) remain significant contributors to global health challenges, spurring the development of new multipurpose delivery technologies to protect individuals from and treat virus infections. However, there are few methods currently available to prevent and no method to date that cures human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or combinations of STIs. While current oral and topical preexposure prophylaxes have protected against HIV infection, they have primarily relied on antiretrovirals (ARVs) to inhibit infection. Yet continued challenges with ARVs include user adherence to daily treatment regimens and the potential toxicity and antiviral resistance associated with chronic use. The integration of new biological agents may avert some of these adverse effects while also providing new mechanisms to prevent infection. Of the biologic-based antivirals, griffithsin (GRFT) has demonstrated potent inhibition of HIV-1 (and a multitude of other viruses) by adhering to and inactivating HIV-1 immediately upon contact. In parallel with the development of GRFT, electrospun fibers (EFs) have emerged as a promising platform for the delivery of agents active against HIV infection. In the study described here, our goal was to extend the mechanistic diversity of active agents and electrospun fibers by incorporating the biologic GRFT on the EF surface rather than within the EFs to inactivate HIV prior to cellular entry. We fabricated and characterized GRFT-modified EFs (GRFT-EFs) with different surface modification densities of GRFT and demonstrated their safety and efficacy against HIV-1 infection in vitro We believe that EFs are a unique platform that may be enhanced by incorporation of additional antiviral agents to prevent STIs via multiple mechanisms.
