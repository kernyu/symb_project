OBJECTIVES: Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Suboptimal treatment has been associated with poor patient outcomes. Our antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) evaluated SAB management based on predefined performance measures both prior to and after instituting a "care package" intervention led by clinical pharmacists and infectious diseases physicians. The primary outcome included a 4-point "optimal care score" (OCS) consisting of targeted antibiotic therapy within 24hours, repeating blood cultures, antibiotic duration assessment, and appropriate duration of therapy. The presence of an ID consult, SAB readmission and mortality were also assessed. METHODS: This was a quasi-experimental, propensity score matched study of SAB management. Adult patients were retrospectively evaluated from October 2011 - October 2012, and intervention took place from November 2013 - December 2015. Intervention consisted of a clinical pharmacist contacting the primary team after identification of SAB to recommend (1) appropriate antibiotics within 24hours, (2) repeat blood cultures to document clearance, (3) assessment for metastatic infection, (4) and appropriate duration of therapy. These constituted the 4-point OCS. ID consult was also recommended. Patients were propensity score matched 1:2 based on age, diabetes, presence of hardware, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolate, and stratified infectious source. Patients >/=18 with SAB were included. RESULTS: Intervention was associated with improved adherence to each metric within the OCS, and more patients in the intervention cohort achieved a perfect OCS of 4. Intervention was associated with a lower rate of readmission and mortality. CONCLUSION: A pharmacist-driven, ASP intervention on SAB therapy was associated with increased adherence to core SAB care metrics and reduced relapse and mortality.
