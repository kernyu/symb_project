Limited information is available regarding AmpC beta-lactamase (ABL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae compared to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteria. Since ABL-producing organisms are often resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents, therapeutic options against these pathogens are limited. Among 230 clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates, 64 (27.8%) were found to produce ABL in our study. Escherichia coli (83.9%) was a predominant pathogen, followed by Citrobacter freundii (5.2%). A significant proportion of ABL-producing isolates (81.3%) were found to be multidrug resistant against commonly used antibiotics. Univariate analysis showed that prior history of taking antibiotics (odds ratio [OR], 5.278; confidence interval [CI], 2.838-9.817; p<0.001) and being inpatients (OR, 4.587; CI, 2.132-9.9; p<0.001) were associated with ABL positivity. Regular antimicrobial resistance surveillance for ABL-producing Enterobacteriaceae is warranted for proper antimicrobial treatment strategy and policy making due to ABL-positive infections.
