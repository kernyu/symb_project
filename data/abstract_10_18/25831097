This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro antifungal susceptibility of Candida species of head-and-neck-irradiated patients (Group 1), non-institutionalized (Group 2) and institutionalized elders (Group 3) using Etest(R) methodology. Candida was isolated from saliva and presumptively identified by CHROMagar Candida(r), confirmed by morphological criteria, carbohydrate assimilation (API 20C AUX(R)) and genetic typing (OPE 18). The collection was made from 29, 34 and 29 individuals (Groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively) with 67 isolates. Etest(R) strips (ketoconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole, amphotericin B and flucytosine) on RPMI (Roswell Park Memorial Institute) agar, on duplicate, were used to evaluate susceptibility. ATTC (American Type Culture Collection) 10231 (Candida albicans) was used as quality control. Among the 67 isolates of Candida species, most were susceptible to azoles, flucytosine and amphotericin B. None of the isolates showed resistance and dose-dependent susceptibility to amphotericin B. There were nine strains resistant to itraconazole, six to fluconazole and two to ketoconazole and ten dose-dependent, mainly to flucytocine. The highest MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) to C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis was 2.671 mug.mL-1, 8.104 mug.mL-1, 4.429 mug.mL-1, all for flucytosine. C. krusei and C. glabrata were associated with higher MIC for azoles and C. glabrata with higher MIC to flucytosine. In summary, susceptibility to all tested antifungal agents was evident. The isolates were more resistant to itraconazole and dose-dependent to flucytosine. A comparison of C. albicans in the three groups showed no outliers. Higher MIC was associated with C. krusei and C. glabrata.
