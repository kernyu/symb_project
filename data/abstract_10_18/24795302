The aim of the study was to determine the in vitro susceptibility of 85 Aspergillus fumigatus strains isolated from domestic geese and from their environment to amphotericin B, clotrimazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, enilconazole, miconazole, ketoconazole, and tioconazole. Samples were collected from clinically healthy birds (oral cavity) and from birds with aspergillosis (lungs and air sacs). The study was carried out using the disk diffusion method according to the Clinical Laboratory and Standards Institute (CLSI) M44-A2 procedure in parallel with the microdilution broth method according to CLSI M38-A2. The disk diffusion method showed that the all of the strains, irrespective of source, were resistant to miconazole. Resistance to the remaining azoles and amphotericin B ranged from 90.6 to 70.6%. Complete susceptibility was noted for voriconazole and enilconazole. Determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) confirmed the high resistance of the strains tested to clotrimazole (MIC90 = 16 microg*mL(-1)), amphotericin B (MIC90 = 16 microg*mL(-1)), varied susceptibility to itraconazole (MIC 0.5-8 microg*mL(-1)), and 100% susceptibility to enilconazole and voriconazole. A correlation was noted between the susceptibility of the strains and their source. The highest percentage of resistant strains was noted in isolates from the lungs (100% for amphotericin B and clotrimazole and 35.7% for itraconazole). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first monitoring conducted in Poland in this area of research.
