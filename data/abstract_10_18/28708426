Salmonella enterica serotype Derby is among the three most common serotypes of nontyphoidal Salmonella isolated from patients with diarrhea in China. In this study, 133 Salmonella Derby isolates from human patients (n = 74) and foods of animal origin (n = 59) in Shanghai, China, between September 2013 and December 2014, were selected to study its phenotypic characteristics and genetic diversity. The isolates were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, plasmid replicon typing, virulence profile determination, and molecular subtyping by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Isolates were frequently resistant to tetracycline (87.22%), sulfisoxazole (74.44%), and streptomycin (62.41%), and a low frequency of resistance was found toward ofloxacin (3.01%), ceftazidime (2.26%), and cefepime (1.50%); in addition, 93 (69.92%) isolates were multidrug resistant. The most common plasmid incompatibility replicon types were the IncF family (FIA, 51.31%; FIC, 27.82%; and FIB, 21.80%) and IncP types (35.34%): these plasmid types may be associated with the spread of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes. All isolates were positive for the Salmonella pathogenicity island (SPI) gene avrA and the fimbrial gene bcfC from among the 10 virulence genes detected, and most of them carried ssaQ (99.25%), mgtC (97.74%), siiD (98.50%), sopB (97.74%), and sopE (96.99%). PFGE showed 68 patterns in nine main clusters at an 85% similarity threshold. Most of the isolates from different sources possessed the same fingerprints or molecular profiles in each cluster, which strongly suggests the possibility that foods of animal origin, especially pork, serve as an important source for human infection. Moreover, this diversity may suggest strains originating from multiple clones. Therefore, surveillance on this serotype should be strengthened to prevent transmission of Salmonella Derby from foods of animal origin, especially pork, to humans.
