The treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) has hinged primarily on supportive care (ie, blood transfusions, colony stimulating agents, iron chelation, etc.) and the US Food and Drug Administration-approved agents, including 5-azacytidine, deoxyazacytidine, and lenalidomide. For patients no longer benefitting from these agents, there is a paucity of effective therapies. The challenges at this time include our limited understanding of the mechanisms of resistance to these therapies and the variables employed to select next best therapies for patients based on: (1) their performance status and medical comorbidities; (2) the molecular feature(s) of their MDS; (3) the prior treatments they have received; and (4) the long-term goal(s)/possibilities for their future treatment (ie, transplant vs no transplant).
