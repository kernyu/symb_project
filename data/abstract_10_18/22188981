Parasitic infections with gastrointestinal nematodes (GINs) represent a major pathological threat associated with the outdoor production of various livestock species. Up to now, the control of these parasitic diseases essentially relied on the use of commercial anthelmintic drugs. However, resistance to anthelmintics is nowadays widespread in worm populations. Recent results indicate that bioactive tanniniferous plants represent a valuable option as an alternative to commercial drugs for the control of GINs. The pertinent use of tannin-containing fodders as nutraceuticals supposes a clear understanding of the mode of action against the worms. The objectives of this paper are: (1) to discuss the nature and quantity of the active molecules involved in the anthelmintic activity; and (2) to review and analyze the changes provoked to the various parasitic stages. The possible involvement of some main polyphenols to explain the bioactivity of some tannin-rich plants will be discussed as well as the possible effects on the various nematode stages, relying on data obtained either with the temperate forage, sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifoliae) or with the tropical legume tree (Lysiloma latisiliquum). The information on the mode of action will be related to the potential consequences for better field applications under entirely different environmental and ecological conditions of productions.
