BACKGROUND: Antibiotics are frequently used to treat acute rhinosinusitis (ARS; acute sinusitis), although many episodes are viral. Because of community resistance concerns, current evidence provides limited support for the use of antibiotics in ARS. We conducted a retrospective comparative effectiveness outcomes assessment of the nasal steroid mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS) versus antibiotics among ARS patients in clinical practice. METHODS: Using the General Practice Research Database (United Kingdom), the earliest ARS event between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2008 (index event) for patients aged 12-75 years and an antibiotic or MFNS prescription +/-2 days was identified. Treatment cohorts were MFNS monotherapy (MM), MFNS + antibiotic (MAT), and antibiotic monotherapy (AM). Logistic regression adjusted for potential confounders and compared odds of rhinosinusitis-related medical encounters and related prescriptions in the 3- to 30-day postindex period. RESULTS: There were 12,679 eligible patients (651 MM; 2285 MAT; 9743 AM). Compared with the reference cohort AM, during the 3- to 30-day postindex period, lower adjusted odds (p < 0.001) of having one or more rhinosinusitis-related medical encounters was observed for MM (odds ratio [OR] = 0.39; 95% CI, 0.26-0.58) and MAT (OR = 0.51; 95% CI, 0.42-0.62); having one or more rhinosinusitis-related prescriptions for MM (OR = 0.51; 95% CI, 0.42-0.63) and MAT (OR = 0.58; 95% CI, 0.52-0.65); having one or more antibiotic, nasal steroid, or oral steroid prescriptions for MM (OR = 0.36; 95% CI, 0.28-0.46) and MAT (OR = 0.51; 95% CI, 0.46-0.58); and having one or more antibiotic prescriptions for MM (OR = 0.43; 95% CI, 0.33-0.58) and MAT (OR = 0.63; 95% CI, (0.55-0.72). CONCLUSION: Compared with AM, using MFNS for initial ARS treatment, alone or with an antibiotic, is associated with a decreased likelihood of both subsequent rhinosinusitis-related medical encounters and use of related prescriptions.
