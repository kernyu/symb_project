BACKGROUND: To investigate antibiotic resistance, the occurrence and distribution of class 1 and 2 integrons in multidrug- resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates from hospitals in Tehran, Iran. The isolates were examined for susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. The mecA gene, class 1 and 2 integrons were detected by PCR. Integrase positive strains were further analysed for the presence of resistance gene cassettes using specific primers and were sequenced. RESULTS: Among 139 S.aureus isolates, 109 (78.4 %) and 112 (80.5 %) strains were considered as multidrug resistant and mecA positive, respectively. Class 1 integrons and internal variable regions were found in 72.6 % (101/139) and 97 % (98/101) and class 2 integrons and variable regions also in 35.2 % (49/139) and 65.3 % (32/49) of S.aureus clinical isolates, respectively. Twelve distinct cassette arrays were found, containing genes encoding resistance to beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, streptothricin, trimethoprim, chloramphenicol,a putative glucose dehydrogenase precursor and a protein with unknown function. Gene cassette arrays aadB, aadA2 and dhfrA1-sat2-aadA1 were common in S.aureus isolates. We detected a completely new gene cassettes which contained aadB, oxa2, aacA4, orfD-aacA4-catB8, aadB-catB3, orfD-aacA4 and aadB-aadA1-cmlA6 of class 1 and dhfrA1-sat2-aadA1, dhfrA11, dhfrA1-sat2 of class 2 integrons. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to report carriage of class 1 and 2 integrons and associated gene cassettes among in S.aureus isolates from Iran.
