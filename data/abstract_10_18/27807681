epsilon-Poly-L-lysine (epsilon-PL), as a food additive, has been widely used in many countries. However, its production still needs to be improved. We successfully enhanced epsilon-PL production of Streptomyces albulus FEEL-1 by introducing mutations related to antibiotics, such as streptomycin, gentamicin, and rifampin. Single- and double-resistant mutants (S-88 and SG-31) were finally screened with the improved epsilon-PL productions of 2.81 and 3.83 g/L, 1.75- to 2.39-fold compared with that of initial strain FEEL-1. Then, the performances of mutants S-88 and SG-31 were compared with the parent strain FEEL-1 in a 5-L bioreactor under the optimal condition for epsilon-PL production. After 174-h fed-batch fermentation, the epsilon-PL production and productivity of hyper-strain SG-31 reached the maximum of 59.50 g/L and 8.21 g/L/day, respectively, which was 138 and 105% higher than that of FEEL-1. Analysis of streptomycin-resistant mutants demonstrated that a point mutation occurred in rpsL gene (encoding the ribosomal protein S12). These single and double mutants displayed remarkable increases of the activities and transcriptional levels of key enzymes in epsilon-PL biosynthesis pathway, which may be responsible for the enhanced mycelia viability, respiratory activity, and epsilon-PL productions of SG-31. These results showed that the new breeding method, called ribosome engineering, could be a novel and effective breeding strategy for the evolution of epsilon-PL-producing strains.
