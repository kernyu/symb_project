We performed a nested case-control study (ratio of 1:4) on the emergence of tigecycline-resistant multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (TR-MDRKP) isolates among patients who initially presented with a tigecycline-susceptible MDRKP isolate. Out of 260 patients, 24 (9%) had a subsequent clinical culture positive for a TR-MDRKP isolate within the 90-day follow-up period. On logistic regression analyses, receipt of tigecycline (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 5.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.80 to 14.23; P = 0.002) was the only independent predictor of subsequent isolation of a TR strain.
