The IncQ is a group of non-conjugative but mobilisable plasmids that are found and stably maintained in a wide range of bacteria contributing to the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes and to the insurgence of multidrug resistant bacteria. Here we report the identification, in clinical Salmonella Typhimurium strains, of an IncQ1 plasmid (pNUC) which confers resistance to sulfamethoxazole, streptomycin and tetracycline through the presence of sul2, strAB and tetA genes, respectively. pNUC was detected in five multidrug resistant S. Typhimurium strains collected in Southern Italy from various hospitals and years of isolation. Bioinformatics analyses highlighted the presence of pNUC-like plasmids in pathogenic bacteria of various Enterobacteriaceae genera or species. Taken as a whole, these plasmids constitute a novel group of IncQ1 plasmids that might have originated through recombination events between a tetR-tetA gene cluster (possibly derived from a Tn1721) and a recipient IncQ1 plasmid related to RSF1010. Our findings raise concerns regarding the possible contribution of the newly identified group of IncQ1 plasmids to the spread of tetracycline resistance.
