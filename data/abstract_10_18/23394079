Given international interest in "treatment as prevention" (TasP) and the pertinence of optimizing antiretroviral treatment (ART) regimens for TasP, 19 French HIV experts were interviewed on their criteria for ART if used specifically for prevention with HIV-positive persons. Through content analysis of the interview material, nine criteria were identified. The most endorsed criteria, collectively, suggest a choice of treatment based on "minimal interference" where negative impacts of ART are minimized and ease of treatment integration maximized in the lives of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) for both the short and long term. These criteria were the tolerance, side effects, and/or toxicity profile of ART, simplicity (e.g., of treatment schedule, dosage form) and the individualization of treatment (e.g., adapted to lifestyle). While virologic efficacy (i.e., a durable, undetectable viral load) was also deemed important, several experts specified that it was virtually assured with current treatments. To a much lesser extent, experts endorsed diffusion of ART into the genital compartments, a strong genetic barrier (against resistance), validated treatments (as opposed to new classes of ART), a rapid reduction in HIV viral load, and treatment cost. Pharmacologically, minimal interference calls for further improvements in the tolerance, side effects and toxicity profile of ART and in the simplicity of ART administration. Clinically, it means avoiding a one-size-fits-all approach to ART in TasP and engagement with and of PLHIV in ART selection and side effects management. Strategically, it emphasises keeping the health and quality of life of PLHIV at the forefront of a TasP-oriented public health intervention.
