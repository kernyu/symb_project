Metabolism and deposition of exogenous gene and protein from transgenic glyphosate herbicide-tolerant soybean meal in SD rats were studied in the experiment. The transgenic soybean GTS40-3-2 meal and its non-transgenic counterpart (parent A5403) were fed to the generation and the second generation Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (Rattus norvegicus). The study added the genetically modified (GM) soybean meal and its non-transgenic control soybean meal (parent A5403) in a ratio of 20% respectively to the feeds. By using qualitative, quantitative PCR and ELISA methods to detect transgenic soybean residues of metabolism ingredients in rats, the safety and influence of GM soybean were evaluated. The results showed that the intestinal fecal and cecum contents of rats were detected with residues of GM ingredients, intestinal flora and organs were not found related genes and protein. These results indicated that transgenic glyphosate herbicide-tolerant soybean GTS40-3-2 meal was as safe as its non-GM soybean meal in long-term feeding study.
