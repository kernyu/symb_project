Repeat HAIs among frequently hospitalized patients may be contributing to the high rates of antibiotic resistance seen in gram-negative bacteria (GNB) in hospital settings. This systematic review examines the state of the literature assessing the association between repeat GNB HAIs and changes in antibiotic susceptibility patterns. A systematic search of English language published literature was conducted to identify studies in peer-reviewed journals from 2000 to 2015. Studies must have assessed drug resistance in repeat GNB infections longitudinally at the patient level. Two researchers independently reviewed search results for papers meeting inclusion criteria and extracted data. Risk of bias was assessed using a modified quality assessment tool based on the Checklist for Measuring Study Quality and the Quality Assessment Checklist for Cases Series. From 3385 articles identified in the search, seven met inclusion criteria. Five reported lower antibiotic susceptibility in repeated infections, one found a change but did not specify in which direction, and one reported no change. All studies were of low to average quality. Despite the dearth of studies examining repeat GNB infections, evidence suggests that repeat infections result in lower antibiotic susceptibility among hospitalized patients. Larger scale studies with strong methodology are warranted.
