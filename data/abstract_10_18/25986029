The in vitro activities of isavuconazole, micafungin, and 8 comparator antifungal agents were determined for 1613 clinical isolates of fungi (1320 isolates of Candida spp., 155 of Aspergillus spp., 103 of non-Candida yeasts, and 35 non-Aspergillus molds) collected during a global survey conducted in 2013. The vast majority of the isolates of the 21 different species of Candida, with the exception of Candida glabrata (MIC90, 2 mug/mL), Candida krusei (MIC90, 1 mug/mL), and Candida guilliermondii (MIC90, 8 mug/mL), were inhibited by </=0.25 mug/mL of isavuconazole. C. glabrata and C. krusei were largely inhibited by </=1 mug/mL of isavuconazole. Resistance to fluconazole was seen in 0.5% of Candida albicans isolates, 11.1% of C. glabrata isolates, 2.5% of Candida parapsilosis isolates, 4.5% of Candida tropicalis isolates, and 20.0% of C. guilliermondii isolates. Resistance to the echinocandins was restricted to C. glabrata (1.3-2.1%) and C. tropicalis (0.9-1.8%). All agents except for the echinocandins were active against 69 Cryptococcus neoformans isolates, and the triazoles, including isavuconazole, were active against the other yeasts. Both the mold active triazoles as well as the echinocandins were active against 155 Aspergillus spp. isolates belonging to 10 species/species complex. In general, there was low resistance levels to the available systemically active antifungal agents in a large, contemporary (2013), global collection of molecularly characterized yeasts and molds. Resistance to azoles and echinocandins was most prominent among isolates of C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, and C. guilliermondii.
