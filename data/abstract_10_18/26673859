OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the distribution of serotypes and the antimicrobial susceptibilities of Streptococcus pneumoniae clinical isolates causing invasive and non-invasive disease in children aged </=60 days in hospitals in Mexico. METHODS: A 15-year retrospective study was conducted for the period 2000 to 2014. Pneumococcal clinical isolates were serotyped by Quellung reaction, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed with the broth microdilution method. RESULTS: A total of 126 pneumococcal isolates were collected. Pneumonia was the most frequent diagnosis (40.5%), followed by meningitis (29.4%), septicemia (16.7%), and other clinical entities, including otitis media and conjunctivitis (13.5%). The most frequent serotypes before the introduction of heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) were 19F, 23F, 7F, and 35B. Serotypes 3, 6A, 10A, 12F, and 15A/B increased after the introduction of PCV7. Serotype 19A was isolated most frequently in the pneumonia and meningitis cases only after the introduction of PCV7, and it displayed a high resistance to penicillin. CONCLUSIONS: Although the number of infections in infants aged </=60 days was low, such infections were not unusual events. New vaccination strategies should be evaluated to limit the risks in this age group.
