OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing K. pneumoniae (ESBL-KP) strains in the National Bone Marrow Transplant Center of Tunis between 2002 and 2011, their associated antibiotics resistance patterns and their molecular features. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the disk diffusion method according to CA-SFM guidelines. All the strains were screened for beta-lactamase genes, plasmidic AmpC genes and integrons. For strains showing reduced susceptibility to ertapenem, carbapenemase genes were analyzed by PCR and sequencing. Genetic relatedness was determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multi-locus sequencing typing. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty eight non repetitive ESBL-KP strains, responsible for infection or colonization, were recovered among 548K. pneumoniae strains. They were also multi-drug resistant. The molecular analysis revealed the prevalence of blaSHV-type (92.18%), followed by blaOXA-1 (81.25%) and blaCTX-M-1 (73.43%). Four ertapenem resistant ESBL-KP strains carried the blaOXA-48 gene associated to blaCTX-M-15 gene (3.12%). Class 1 integrons was the most prevalent among our isolates (85.15%). High diversity was demonstrated by PFGE with limited clonal dissemination of one major (n=13 strains) and 11 minor clusters (each comprising 2 to 3 strains). MLST of representative strains showed also high diversity with two main epidemic clones: ST15, associated to the major cluster and ST101, associated to five minor clusters (n=12 strains). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides relevant information on the ESBL-KP strains epidemiology in onco-hematology patients of which 19.53% belonged to the specific CTX-M-15K. pneumoniae clones ST15 and ST101.
