The rising prevalence of multiresistant bacteria has become a major clinical concern. Yet, the prognostic impact is not well elucidated. A growing number of studies have found associations between acquired resistance, inappropriate therapy and mortality. The key underlying factors seem to be delay of appropriate antibiotic therapy and possibly use of more toxic therapy. However, methodological issues including control group selection and adjustment for potential confounders must be taken into consideration when assessing outcome studies for patients infected with resistant microorganisms.
