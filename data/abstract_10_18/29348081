Biologically, screening of medicinal plants extracts have been since pre-historic to determine the antioxidants and antimicrobial profile. The present study was aimed to investigate and evaluate crude extract and different fractions of Bergenia ciliata Sternb (rhizome) for bioactivity which is most considerable medicinal plants. The chloroform fraction was found to be highly anti-oxidative with the IC50 value (4.15+/-0.82) as compare to ethyl acetate and n-hexane fraction. In addition, neither crude extract nor any fraction showed inhibition against fungal strains, i.e. Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger. Furthermore, the crude extract and fractions of B. ciliata (rhizome) exhibiting promising activities against Bacillus atrophoeus, Bacillus subtilis, Kleibsiella pneumonia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. In summary, B. ciliata is recommended as a source of bioactive compounds which might be used against oxidative stress and drug resistance bacteria.
