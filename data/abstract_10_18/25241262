The prevalence of Escherichia coli sequence type 131 (ST131) and its subclone H30 was assessed among a collection of 490 E. coli isolated in 2013 in a French university hospital. The prevalence of ST131 was 4% among bloodstream isolates (regardless of antimicrobial resistance) and 17.2% among extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing isolates. Although a much lower prevalence of ST131 was found among bloodstream E. coli isolates compared with other countries, a large predominance of H30 subclone within ST131 was confirmed. It was also confirmed that, among ESBL-producing E. coli, ST131 isolates were more frequently resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides than non-ST131 isolates.
