CONTEXT: Infection caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) producing organism is a major problem regarding antibiotic resistance. AIMS: The aim of this study was to find out the antibiogram of ESBL producing organisms isolated from various samples. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This cross-sectional study was carried out in the Department of Microbiology of a Tertiary Care Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh from January to June 2014. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: One Hundred and seventy-nine ESBL producing Gram-negative organisms detected phenotypically by double-disc synergy test were enrolled in this study. Required data were collected from the records of the Microbiology laboratory. RESULTS: ESBL production was detected in 16.07% (179/1114) of isolated organism. Of Escherichia coli, 15.75% were ESBL producers; 14.01% Pseudomonas spp., 36.84% Proteus spp., 18.57% Klebsiella spp., and 21.05% of Acinetobacter spp., were ESBL producers. Maximum (43.58%) ESBL producers were isolated from surgery departments, and wound swabs yielded majority (53%) of them. About 13% ESBL producers were isolated in outdoor patients mostly from community-acquired infections. Most ESBL producers were resistant to commonly used antibiotics. Carbapenems especially imipenem was the most effective drug showing excellent sensitivity; colistin and piperacillin/tazobactam also had better sensitivity result. Most of the ESBL producers showed a good sensitivity to amikacin, but all of them were highly resistant to ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: ESBL production should be detected routinely in all Microbiology laboratories. Infection control, rational use of antibiotics must be done promptly to prevent the development and spread of ESBL producing organisms.
