The house fly, Musca domestica L., is one of the major pests in dairy operations that has developed resistance to a number of insecticides with different modes of action. Adult house fly populations from six dairies in Punjab, Pakistan were evaluated for resistance to insecticides with novel modes of action (abamectin, emamectin benzoate, fipronil, imidacloprid, indoxacarb, and spinosad). Significant levels of resistance to most of the insecticides tested were observed in the present study. For avermectins at LC50 level, the resistance ratios were in the range of 38.40 to 94.44-fold for abamectin and 13.16 to 36.30-fold for emamectin benzoate. Fipronil LC50 resistance ratios exceeded 10-fold in three house fly populations, while all the populations had >10-fold resistance ratios for imidacloprid. Indoxacarb and spinosad had the lowest resistance ratios that ranged from 3.02 to 7.12-fold for indoxacarb and 2.91 to 9.0-fold for spinosad. As the resistance to fipronil, indoxacarb, and spinosad are emerging, therefore these chemicals should be used cautiously in management programs to retain the efficacy for longer times.
