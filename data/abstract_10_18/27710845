Flocculation as the core technology of sludge pretreatment can improve the dewatering performance of sludge that enables to reduce the cost of sludge transportation and the subsequent disposal costs. Therefore, synthesis of high-efficiency and economic flocculant is remarkably desired in this field. This study presents a cationic polyacrylamide (CPAM) flocculant with microblock structure synthesized through ultraviolet (UV)-initiated template copolymerization by using acrylamide (AM) and methacrylamido propyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (MAPTAC) as monomers, sodium polyacrylate (PAAS) as template, and 2,2'-azobis [2-(2-imidazolin-2-yl) propane] dihydrochloride (VA-044) as photoinitiator. The microblock structure of the CPAM was observed through nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H NMR and (13)C NMR) spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses. Furthermore, thermogravimetric/differential scanning calorimetry (TG/DSC) analysis was used to evaluate its thermal decomposition property. The copolymerization mechanism was investigated through the determination of the binding constant MK and study on polymerization kinetics. Results showed that the copolymerization was conducted in accordance with the I (ZIP) template polymerization mechanism, and revealed the coexistence of bimolecular termination free-radical reaction and mono-radical termination in the polymerization process. Results of sludge dewatering tests indicated the superior flocculation performance of microblock flocculant than random distributed CPAM. The residual turbidity, filter cake moisture content, and specific resistance to filtration reached 9.37 NTU, 68.01%, and 6.24 (10(12) m kg(-1)), respectively, at 40 mg L(-1) of template poly(AM-MAPTAC) and pH 6.0. Furthermore, all flocculant except commercial CPAM showed a wide scope of pH application.
