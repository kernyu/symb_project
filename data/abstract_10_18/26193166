A method for the preparation of 3,5-bridged piperazin-2-ones from a tryptophan-proline-based diketopiperazine is described using diphosgene to induce the ring closure. Density functional theory calculations were conducted to study the mechanism of this C-C bond formation. Several derivatives of the thus obtained alpha-chloroamine were synthesized by substitution of the chlorine atom using a range of O-, N-, S-, and C-nucleophiles. This novel class of brevianamide F analogues possess interesting breast cancer resistance protein inhibitory activity.
