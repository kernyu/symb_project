OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of Lamivudine on chronic hepatitis B patients with chemotherapy or immunosuppressive agents therapy, and research the drug resistance. METHODS: Thirty-one cases of chronic hepatitis B patients who needed chemotherapy or immunosuppressive agents therapy were enrolled and divided into two group, HBeAg-positive group (n = 20) and HBeAg-negative group (n = 11), then given Lamivudine for preventive treatment. Virus response, biochemical response and serum response were evaluated as effective index, and analyzed the difference between the two groups for statistical significance. Meanwhile, drug resistance rate, impact factor of resistance and security were analyzed. RESULTS: At the end of 48 weeks' treatment, the rate of HBV DNA under the detection limit was 41.94%, and the decline of HBV DNA compared with baseline was 2.35 lg. The normalization rate of ALT, the negative rate of HbeAg and the seroconversion rate of HBeAg/HBeAb were 92.31%, 25% and 20% respectively. HBeAg-positive group and HBeAg-negative group patients in the complete virus response, the decline of HBV DNA compared with baseline and the resistance rate had no statistics significance (P > 0.05). At the same time, virology breakthrough occurred in four patients, and resistance mutation was detected in three cases among them. The resistance rate was 9.68%. The type of genotype mutation were all rtM204I. Multi-factor regression analysis showed that the baseline factors including age, gender, HBeAg status, baseline HBV DNA level and baseline ALT had no significant compact on drug resistance. Serious adverse reactions were not found in all patients. CONCLUSION: For chronic hepatitis B patients who needed chemotherapy or immunosuppressive agents treatment, Lamivudine for preventive antiviral therapy is a good option with good antiviral effect and safety. It is necessary to pay attention to the occurrence of drug resistance.
