OBJECTIVES: This study aimed at assessing the epidemiology and genetic diversity of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus sciuri (MRSS) from different farm animal species. METHODS: Nasal swabs were collected from 200 pigs, 100 dairy cows, 100 beef cows, 150 veal calves and 200 broilers. Colonies were isolated on selective media containing cefoxitin and the mecA gene was detected by PCR. Antimicrobial resistance was determined by broth microdilution. The genetic diversity was assessed by PFGE and resistance and virulence genes were detected by microarray analysis. RESULTS: The total MRSS prevalence at the animal level was estimated at 9.5%, varying from approximately 10% in veal (13.3%), broilers (12.5%) and dairy cows (10.0%) to 6.5% in pigs and 3.0% in beef cows. mecA was detected in all isolates. SCCmec elements of type III and non-typeable ones were seen most frequently. More than 90% of isolates were non-wild-type (NWT) for gentamicin, penicillin, tiamulin, clindamycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin. The frequency of NWT isolates for fusidic acid and trimethoprim ranged between 78% and 87%. PFGE analysis allowed distinction between two major clusters. Most isolates tested by microarray carried erm and tet genes. Virulence genes were also detected, including an isa gene encoding an immune-evasion factor and the hsdS2 gene encoding a site-specific deoxyribonuclease. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that multiresistant MRSS is carried by different farm animal species. Although some animals shared the same strain, PFGE showed different patterns, indicating high diversity among the MRSS isolates recovered. The absence of clusters associated with a certain animal species suggests low host specificity.
