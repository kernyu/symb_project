Multidrug-resistant and New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) -producing Acinetobacter baumannii are increasingly reported. A collection of five NDM-1-positive A. baumannii isolates recovered in four European countries were analysed. Genotyping was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, multiplex PCR sequence typing, Diversilab and multilocus sequence typing. Three distinct sequence types were identified. All isolates harboured a chromosomally located bla(NDM-1) gene within a Tn125-like transposon. One isolate co-expressed another unrelated carbapenemase OXA-23. This report constitutes the first epidemiological study of NDM-1-producing A. baumannii from four countries.
