OBJECTIVE: To assess the current microbiological profile and sensitivity to antibiotics in patients with acute bacterial prostatitis (ABP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the period 2003-2010, we treated 192 ABP patients, aged from 18 to 85 years (average 56.3 years). We performed a biochemical examination including a microbiological urine examination. After admission, we immediately began the empirical antibacterial treatment. RESULTS: The clinical picture was dominated by pain, prostate enlargement and failure of micturition in 185 (96.4%) patients; 14 (7.3%) patients had acute urinary retention where epicystostomy was necessary. Fever occurred in 177 (92.2%) patients and Escherichia coli was the most frequent etiological agent detected in 103 (53.7%) patients followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella species. In 16 (8.3%) patients we found 2 bacteriological strains. Sterile urine was found in 65 (33.8%) patients. Fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and cephalosporins were used most frequently. 147 (76.6%) patients were treated according to the microbiological results. Overview of resistance shows an increase in resistance to fluoroquinolones. In 14 (7.3%) patients there was progression to urosepsis. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should consider local drug-resistance patterns when choosing antibiotics and should adjust the therapy on the basis of bacterial cultures and local sensitivity to antibiotics.
