The prevalence and genetic basis of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in Klebsiella pneumoniae remains unclear in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, this study was devoted to determine the prevalence and characterize ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae in Al-Qassim area, Saudi Arabia. A total of 430 isolates of K. pneumoniae isolated from clinical samples were collected over 6 months from January to June 2008. These isolates were screened for the presence of ESBLs by double-disk synergy test and re-evaluated by E-test ESBL method. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of 15 antibiotics against ESBL-positive strains were determined by E-test strips. The beta-lactamases involved were characterized by polymerase chain reaction assays and DNA sequencing. Conjugation experiments were done and ISEcp1 elements were tested among CTX-M positive isolates. The prevalence of ESBL was 25.6% (110/430) and all ESBL-positive isolates were sensitive to imipenem and tigecycline; however, the resistance rate to gentamicin, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin was 87.3%, 10%, and 9.1%, respectively. Of these, 89.1% produced SHV, 70.9% produced TEM, and 36.4% were CTX-M-producing strains. The prevalence of ESBL SHV SHV-12 and SHV-5 was of 60% and 18.2%, respectively, and various non-ESBL SHV, including SHV-1 (5.5%), -11 (3.6%), and -85 (1.8%), was detected. However, the prevalence of CTX-M-15 and CTX-M-14 was 34.5% and 1.8%, respectively. ISEcp1 element was detected in 60% of bla(CTX-M-15) genes. All bla(CTX-M) genes were transferable; however, most of bla(SHV-12) and bla(SHV-5) were not transferable. TEM-type ESBLs were not detected in any of the isolates. This is the first description of CTX-M-14, SHV-5, SHV-11, and SHV-85 in Saudi Arabia. We have documented the dominance of K. pneumoniae SHV-12 and highlighted the emergence of CTX-M-15 in Saudi Arabia.
