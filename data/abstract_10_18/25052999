BACKGROUND: Calf diarrhea is a major economic concern in bovine industry all around the world. This study was carried out in order to investigate distribution of virulence genes, pathotypes, serogroups and antibiotic resistance properties of Escherichia coli isolated from diarrheic calves. RESULTS: Totally, 76.45% of 824 diarrheic fecal samples collected from Isfahan, Chaharmahal, Fars and Khuzestan provinces, Iran were positive for E. coli and all of them were also positive for cnf2, hlyA, cdtIII, f17c, lt, st, stx1, eae, ehly, stx2 and cnf1 virulence genes. Chaharmahal had the highest prevalence of STEC (84.61%), while Isfahan had the lowest (71.95%). E. coli serogroups had the highest frequency in 1-7 days old calves and winter season. Distribution of ETEC, EHEC, AEEC and NTEC pathotypes among E. coli isolates were 28.41%, 5.07%, 29.52% and 3.49%, respectively. Statistical analyses were significant for presence of bacteria between various seasons and ages. All isolates had the high resistance to penicillin (100%), streptomycin (98.25%) and tetracycline (98.09%) antibiotics. The most commonly detected resistance genes were aadA1, sul1, aac[3]-IV, CITM, and dfrA1. The most prevalent serogroup among STEC was O26. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings should raise awareness about antibiotic resistance in diarrheic calves in Iran. Clinicians should exercise caution when prescribing antibiotics.
