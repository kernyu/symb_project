The incidence of endophthalmitis after pars plana vitrectomy is low. Silicone oil is a tamponading agent which has anti-microbial activity. Post-operative endophthalmitis following vitrectomy with silicone oil tamponade has been rarely reported. We describe the case of a young male who underwent pars plana vitrectomy with silicone oil for retinal detachment with a giant retinal tear. He developed a clinical picture suggestive of endophthalmitis on the first post-operative day, and vitreous culture grew multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. He was treated with intravitreal piperacillin/tazobactam, along with appropriate surgical management. This was followed by resolution of the infection with a remarkable improvement in visual acuity. This is the first case of multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa endophthalmitis following pars plana vitrectomy with silicone oil treated successfully with piperacillin/tazobactam.
