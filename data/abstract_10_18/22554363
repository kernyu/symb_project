INTRODUCTION: Non-tuberculosis mycobacterium is especially seen in AIDS and non-immunosuppressant patients. This study was designed to evaluate data relating to non-tuberculosis mycobacterium content in patients' sputum for the clinical importance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: During 2009-2010 at Sureyyapasa Chest Diseases and Chest Surgery Training and Research Hospital clinics, 75 patients [30 women (40%) and 45 men (69%); mean age (SD): 48.7 (15.9) years] with non-tuberculosis mycobacterium were determined by the rapid test and NAP test in Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT), which had atypical growth in 51.864 Lowenstein-Jensen. Identification was done with Hsp65PCRREA methods in 32 (43%) cases. Treatment management, radiology, bacteriology, co-morbidity, treatment outcomes were evaluated from medical records, calling patients and from tuberculosis dispensaries. RESULTS: In 9 (28%) patients Mycobacterium abscessus, in 8 (25%) patients Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), in 5 (16%) patients Mycobacterium kansasii was found with identification Hsp65PCRREA methods. In 18 (24%) of 75 cases with American Thoracic Society definition and treatment criteria, treatment was administered using major and minor drugs. Standard tuberculosis treatment was administered in 25 (33%) of the 75 cases. In 8 of 25 (32%) cases identification of non-tuberculosis mycobacterium was evident. In 32 of 75 cases follow up was performed with no treatment. One positive atypical growth culture was identified in 23 (72%) of 32 patients. Treatment was administered in 43 cases while 25 (58%) of 43 were cured, 3 (7%) of 43 were default and 3 (7%) died. Drug resistance was the outcome in 36 cases. While 31 (86%) had any drug resistance, 27 (75%) had HR drug resistance. Past history of tuberculosis treatment was evident in 20 (40%) cases. Respiratory and non-respiratory diseases were identified equally in 18 (38%) cases. Radiological consolidation in 28 (65%), and cavity in 16 (37%) cases were determined. CONCLUSION: In order to carry out the right treatment and epidemiologic evaluation, it is important to identify non-tuberculosis mycobacterium by culture methods.
