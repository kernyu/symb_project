BACKGROUND: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains were isolated and characterized from environmental surfaces of two fire stations from two independent districts in the northwestern United States. After the first sampling and before the second sampling, education was provided, additional signage was added, and changes in disinfection protocols were put in place. Nasal carriage of MRSA was determined at the second sampling. METHODS: Environmental samples were collected using SANICULT swabs and RODAC plates. Biochemical tests and 16S rRNA sequencing confirmed MRSA isolates. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed, and the mecA gene, multilocus sequence typing, and SCCmec typing were determined by polymerase chain reaction, sequencing, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis. RESULTS: MRSA was isolated from 44 of 1,064 samples examined (4.1%) and included USA300 isolates. The same strains of MRSA were found in both the garage (ie, medic and fire trucks and protective clothing) and the living quarters. Nasal carriage of MRSA from one fire district was 22.5%. CONCLUSION: Community-like and hospital-like MRSA were isolated from the environmental samples. The majority of the nasal MRSA/S aureus isolates were genetically related to the environmental MRSA strains, suggesting possible transmission between personnel and the environmental surfaces. Further research is needed to verify this hypothesis.
