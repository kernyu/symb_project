The purpose of this study was to survey Salmonella enterica serotype Virchow phage type 19 (S. Virchow PT19) strains submitted to the Spanish National Reference Laboratory for Salmonella (SNRLS) from 2002 to 2006 in order to determine the rate type and genetic background of beta-lactam resistance and to further identify the associated resistances. Ninety-nine S. Virchow PT19 strains were analysed. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the disk diffusion method using Mueller-Hinton agar medium. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and, later, sequencing of the obtained fragments were performed for the molecular characterisation of the resistances. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and plasmid analysis (using conjugation, Southern blot hybridisation and replicon typing) were used for characterisation. The characterisation of S. Virchow PT19 strains allowed the identification of a clonal multiresistant S. Virchow PT19 harbouring an IncH12 plasmid with the bla (CTX-M-9) gene within the complex integron In60 distributed across Spain. An IncH12 plasmid widely reported and studied in Enterobacteria is described in a clonal multiresistant S. Virchow PT19 which has successfully spread throughout Spain.
