The entire plasmid content of a multidrug-resistant, CTX-M-15-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae ST416 clone was investigated. Two FII(K) plasmids, pKDO1 (127 kb) and pKPN-CZ (207 kb), were identified and found to carry a formidable set of genes conferring resistance to toxic compounds, metals, and antimicrobial drugs and exhibiting novel features putatively associated with adaptation and fitness of the bacterium in the human host.
