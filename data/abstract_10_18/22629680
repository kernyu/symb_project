The oligotrophic bacterium Ancylobacter vacuolatus contains two large plasmids pREV1 and pREV2 (about 150 and 250 kb, respectively). Plasmid pREV1 carries the genes responsible for resistance to chloramphenicol, trimethoprim and y-irradiation. Plasmid pREV2 carries the genes responsible for resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics and formation of gas vacuoles. The ability to grow under oligotrophic conditions did not depend directly on either plasmid and was probably chromosome-encoded. Nevertheless, strains lacking the pREV2 plasmid had an improved capacity for growth in enriched media, as is evident from the following findings: 1) the growth rate of the strains lacking pREV2 was about 60% higher with an induction time of about two times less than those for strains carrying the plasmid; 2) the overall cell yield in rich media and colony size on non-oligotrophic agarized media increased with removal of pREV2; 3) the characteristic change in cell morphology occurring in the wild type ofA. vacuolatus when switched from oligotrophic to eutrophic growth conditions was not observed in the strains lacking pREV2; 4) bacterial strains lacking pREV2 exhibited significantly higher rRNA content than the parent strain. As a possible explanation for these phenomena, we suggest that the pREV2 plasmid carries gene(s) for protein(s) acting as repressor(s) of expression of some enzymes involved in eutrophic metabolism. Such protein(s) probably participate in switching between the oligotrophic and eutrophic types of metabolism in response to changing nutrient supply in the environment.
