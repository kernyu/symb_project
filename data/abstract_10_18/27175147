The present study was conducted to detect the occurrence, serotype, genotype, phylogenetic relationship and antimicrobial resistance pattern of STEC from healthy goats of West Bengal, India. From the 125 faecal samples collected from healthy goats, 245 isolates were identified as Escherichia coli. The E. coli harbouring any gene for Shiga toxins (stx 1/stx 2) was detected in 36 (14.7%) of the 245 E. coli isolates. These STEC strains belonged to 22 different serogroups (O2, O5, O20, O21, O22, O25, O41, O44, O45, O60, O71, O76, O84, O85, O87, O91, O103, O112, O113, O120, O156, and O158) and three were untypeable. The stx 1 and stx 2 was detected in 26 (72.2%) and 21 (58.3%) of Shiga toxin producing-E. coli (STEC) isolates, respectively. Further, E. coli harbouring eaeA only (Enteropathogenic E. coli) and ehxA was detected in 22 (61.1%) and 28 (77.7%) isolates, respectively. Whereas the saa was present in 8 (22.2%) E. coli isolates. The subtyping of the 26 E. coli strains possessing stx 1 showed that 73.% (19/26) of these isolates were positive for stx 1C subtype. Of the 21 isolates with the stx 2 gene, 42.8% (9/21) were positive for stx 2C, and 38.1% (8/21) were positive for stx 2d gene. The phylogenetic analysis of STEC strains after RAPD reveals eight major clusters. However, no serogroup specific cluster was observed. Resistance was observed most frequently to erythromycin (80.5%), amikacin (52.7%), cephalothin (50%), kanamycin (41.6%), neomycin (36.1%) and gentamycin (36.1%) and less frequently to norfloxacin (2.7%), enrofloxacin (2.7%), and ciprofloxacin (2.7%). Multidrug resistance was observed in eleven STEC isolates.
