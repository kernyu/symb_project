BACKGROUND: We investigated the efficacy of rituximab and low-dose cyclosporine combination therapy for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) in children with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS). METHODS: Five FSGS children with SRNS were treated twice with rituximab and low-dose cyclosporine (CyA) combination therapy (RTX-CyAT). The clinical features and laboratory data were investigated before and after RTX-CyAT, and the outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: Prednisolone (PSL) was discontinued 3 months after RTX-CyAT in all patients. The number of CD19-positive cells decreased to <1% of all white blood cells in all patients at 1 month after RTX-CyAT, and was maintained at this level for 259.6 +/- 68.2 days. All patients remained in remission for the duration of the decrease in CD19-positive cells to <1%. Two patients also remained in remission throughout the observation period, with three patients having a single relapse at 333 +/- 89 days (range, 231-376 days) after RTX-CyAT. In all patients, the mean steroid and CyA doses after RTX-CyAT were lower than those before RTX-CyAT. CONCLUSIONS: RTX-CyAT is effective in FSGS patients with SRNS and may ameliorate the side-effects of PSL and immunosuppressive drugs.
