Leishmaniasis is a group of diseases that presents various clinical manifestations. Many studies have shown that the parasite plays an important role in the clinical manifestations and prognosis of this disease. The cutaneous and mucosal forms of American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL) are associated with Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis, which exhibits intraspecific genetic polymorphisms and various clinical manifestations. The present study focused on four different L. braziliensis strains that were isolated from patients with distinct Glucantime((R)) treatment responses. The isolates were described based on their molecular, biological, and infective characteristics. Growth patterns in culture medium and different grow phases were analyzed, MID-Logarithimic (Mid-LOG), Logarithimic (LOG) and Stationary (STAT) phases. Complement resistance was evaluated using guinea pig serum. Infection to murine peritoneal macrophages, cytokine and nitric oxide were analyzed. Ultrastructural features were determined by transmission electron microscopy, and molecular characteristics were determined based on random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). All of the L. braziliensis isolates showed typical growth and similar complement sensitivity patterns. Markedly lower infectivity indexes were observed for all strains in the LOG phase, with different cytokine profiles. The ultrastructure analysis revealed distinct differences between the MID-LOG, LOG, and STAT phases. The RAPD results showed a divergence between the isolates of the L. braziliensis. The in vitro characterization of L. braziliensis isolates from humans with different treatment responses using various parameters enabled us to observe differences among the isolates. Molecular and in vivo characterizations are currently under study to improve understanding of the parasite-host interaction that can imply in the clinical manifestation differences.
