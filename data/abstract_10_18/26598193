PURPOSE: To evaluate postoperative infection patterns of patients suffering from oral and maxillofacial neoplasms. The risk factors giving rise to postoperative infections were analyzed. Infection bacteria and antibiotic resistance were investigated. METHODS: Fifty-three cases suffering from postoperative infection were selected during 2007.12-2012.12 at the Department of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery, West China College of Stomatology. The relationship between infections and factors including patients' sex, age, type of tumor, operation time and methods were evaluated with Excel and SPSS 21.0 software package, putting emphasis on infection bacteria and drug-resistance. RESULTS: Postoperative infection mainly occurred in patients with oral malignant tumors. Operation types and time had important influence on postoperative infection. The infection bacteria included gram-positive (59.5%) and gram-negative ones (40.5%). Streptococcus pyogenes accounted for the majority of G- bacteria, which was very sensitive to beta-lactam antibiotics. Pseudomonas aeruginosa were multi-drug resistant G- bacteria, which brought difficulties to the treatment of the infection. CONCLUSIONS: Integrant bacterial culture and drug sensitivity test should be performed to choose appropriate antibiotics, and monitor multi-drug resistant bacteria, so as to improve the control rates of postoperative infection.
