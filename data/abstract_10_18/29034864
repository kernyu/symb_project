The implementation of PCR for the detection of carbapenemase genes enables rapid results with significant epidemiological implications. Two commercial real-time PCR assays, the Hylabs Hy-CRE and Sacace MDR MBL+KPC/OXA, were evaluated for the detection of the genes blaKPC, blaVIM, blaNDM, blaIMP and blaOXA-48-carbapenemasein a collection of 96 carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae strains with different resistant mechanisms. Both assays exhibited excellent diagnostic performance, with 100 % sensitivity and specificity.
