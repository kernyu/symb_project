The 19th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) highlighted new information and provided in-depth discussion on advances in antiretroviral therapy (ART). Data regarding investigational drugs, including integrase strand transfer inhibitors (InSTIs) and zinc-finger nucleases disrupting CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), were presented. Treatment trials in treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients added to the knowledge base of which antiretroviral agents to initiate and when. Data from trials and observational cohorts suggested that, for patients on successful ART in resource-rich settings, mortality from non-HIV-related diseases may surpass that from HIV-related diseases, and overall lifespan may be nearing that of people without HIV infection. In resource-limited settings (RLS), prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) and ART scale-up remained priorities. New data on antiretroviral resistance in RLS and on the implications of low-frequency mutations were presented.
