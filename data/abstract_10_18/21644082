Acinetobacter baumannii which is one of the most frequent nosocomial pathogens, has drawn attention in the last years owing to multi-drug resistant strains. A.baumannii may give rise to nosocomial epidemics especially in intensive care units and may lead to treatment failure due to its increasing antimicrobial resistance. These gram-negative non-fermentative coccobacilli may be encountered also in community associated infections. However, they are frequently isolated in pneumonia, urinary tract infection, bacteremia, meningitis and wound infections that develop in patients hospitalized for serious diseases. Although detailed data about the epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance patterns related to this bacteria exist, relatively limited data is present about the virulence factors and environmental physiology of A.baumannii. The role of some bacterial virulence factors in the pathogenesis of Acinetobacter infections have been enlightened by recent investigations. Among these virulence factors, production of extracellular enzymes with lipolytic and cytolytic activities, outer membrane protein (AbOmpA) with apoptotic effects on epithelial cells, adhesion molecules (fimbria and AbOmpA) that function during attachment to epithelial cells, K1 type capsular structure, type-1 pili and AbOmpA induced biofilm formation, siderophore (acinetobactin) or hemin mediated iron acquisition mechanisms, quorum sensing system that functions by the help of N-acyl homoserine lacton signal molecules and cellular components that enable Acinetobacter species to live under inappropriate environmental conditions like dryness, low temperature, restricted nutritional elements, can be counted. New information about the virulence factors will help better understanding of the adaptive response of A.baumannii in the host setting. This review is focused on the current information about the virulence factors of of A.baumannii.
