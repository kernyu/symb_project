INTRODUCTION: This study investigated the antimicrobial resistance and clonality of Salmonella enterica serotype Kentucky in poultry and poultry sources in Nigeria, and compared the isolates with the clone of S. Kentucky STI98-X1 CIPR using (PFGE) and (MIC). METHODOLOGY: Fecal samples from chickens and poultry sources (litter, water, rodent and lizard fecal samples) were collected from fourteen (14) poultry farms in 2007, 2010 and 2011 and were analyzed for S. Kentucky. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Six percent of the samples were positive for S. Kentucky - all resistant to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin. The isolates are grouped within the PFGE cluster X1 of S. Kentucky STI98 CIPR, indicating the association to the emerging and widely spread CIPR S. Kentucky clone with poultry and poultry sources.
