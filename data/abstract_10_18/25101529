This July 2014 edition of the IAS-USA drug resistance mutations list updates the figures last published in March 2013. The following mutations have been added to existing classes or drugs: K65E/N has been added to the bars for the nucleoside and nucleotide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nRTIs) abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, and tenofovir; L100I has been added to the bar for the nonnucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) rilpivirine; and F121Y has been added to the bars for the integrase strand transfer inhibitors (InSTIs) dolutegravir, elvitegravir, and raltegravir. With regard to protease inhibitors (PIs), it cannot be excluded that drug resistance may be selected for outside the protease encoding region.
