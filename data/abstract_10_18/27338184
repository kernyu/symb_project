Helminth parasites cause significant morbidity and mortality in endemic countries. Given the severity of symptoms that helminths may elicit in the host, intervention with prophylactic and therapeutic measures is imperative. Treatment with benzimidazoles is the most widely used means of combatting these parasites. However, widespread use of these drugs can select for drug-resistant parasite strains. In this review, we approach the problem of benzimidazole resistance in helminths in both humans and animals, focusing on the properties of the drug, the molecular mechanisms of drug resistance and how resistance is diagnosed.
