We investigated the prevalence of Salmonella in chicken meat from northern, central, and southern Japan. Between 2006 and 2008, 821 samples from these three regions were collected and examined. Salmonella isolates were detected in 164 (20.0%) of these samples, with 15 (10.0%) of 150, 113 (27.5%) of 411, and 36 (13.8%) of 260 recovered from the northern, central, and southern regions, respectively. We recovered 452 Salmonella isolates. From the isolates, 27 serovars were identified; the predominant serovars isolated were Salmonella Infantis (n=81), Salmonella Kalamu (n=56), and Salmonella Schwarzengrund (n=43). Of the 452 isolates, 443 (98.0%) were resistant to one or more antibiotics, and 221 (48.9%) showed multiple-antibiotic resistance, thereby implying that multiple-antibiotic resistant Salmonella organisms are widespread in chicken meat in Japan. Resistance to oxytetracycline was most common (72.6%), followed by dihydrostreptomycin (69.2%) and bicozamycin (49.1%). This study, the first to report Salmonella prevalence in chicken meat throughout Japan, could provide valuable data for monitoring and controlling Salmonella infection in the future.
