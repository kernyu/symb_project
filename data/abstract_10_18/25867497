Worldwide, the most highly consumed meat is of porcine origin. The production and distribution of swine meat are affected by diverse health matters, such as influenza and diarrhea, which cause head losses and require the use of antibiotics and other drugs in hog farms. To stimulate newborn piglet immune responses and increase resistance to infections, we developed a spray-drying technique to produce dried swine dialyzable spleen extract (sDSE), an immunomodulator. Based on the size-exclusion ultra performance liquid chromatography quantitative analysis, it was possible to recover up to 58% of the product after the drying process. The biological activity of orally administered dried sDSE increased mouse survival and induced cytokine production in a herpes infection model.
