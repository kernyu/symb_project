AIM: Comparative characteristic of diagnostic value of main cultural-biological characteristics of Burkholderiae pseudomallei group. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 59 strains of B. pseudomallei, 14 --B. mallei and 5--B. thailandensis were used in the study. Biochemical characteristics were studied by generally accepted methods, antigenic properties were evaluated in agglutination reaction and immunoelectrophoresis, virulence was determined by Dlm for laboratory animals, antibiotic sensitivity was verified by disc-diffusion method. RESULTS: Passaging of B. pseudomallei and B. mallei in mice results in increase of virulence, preservation of initial sensitivity to antibiotics, contraction of precipitogen specter. During therapy of experimental melioidosis in guinea pigs resistance to chemopreparations of various groups is formed. Varying degree of virulence and sensitivity to antibiotics of various B. thailandensis strains was established. Dependence of sensitivity on in vitro cultivation was not detected. CONCLUSION: Stability of diagnostically significant tests used for identification of Burkholderiae pseudomallei group was established. Relevance of attribute set expansion that facilitates their differentiation is justified.
