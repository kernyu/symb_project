AIMS: The purpose of this study was to characterize the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) strains isolated in the South Moravia region of the Czech Republic. RESULTS: Out of 109 ESBL-producing UPEC isolates, the CTX-M-15-producing E. coli O25b-ST131 was detected in 55 (50.5%) and the CTX-M-27-producing E. coli O25b-ST131 in 40 isolates (36.7%). Most isolates were distributed among three pulsed-field gel electrophoresis clusters and were characterized by low variability relative to antibiotic resistance patterns, in E. coli phylogroups and by the prevalence of virulence and bacteriocin determinants. Despite this, 14 groups of identical isolates (comprising a total of 41 isolates) were identified when all tested parameters of E. coli were combined. CONCLUSIONS: Since the occurrence of E. coli B2-O25b-ST131 CTX-M-27 was only recently described in Asia, the frequent isolation of this lineage among patients in South Moravia suggests an efficient transfer of this clone from Asian countries. The limited variability of detected parameters of ESBL-producing UPEC strains is consistent with a common origin of the analyzed isolates, in which there is an ongoing process of genetic diversification.
