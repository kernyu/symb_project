To increase understanding of community-acquired resistance, stool samples from 477 nonhospitalized persons in Maryland and Michigan, from 2004 to 2008, were screened for ceftriaxone resistance. Seven (1.5%) yielded ceftriaxone-resistant Escherichia coli; one isolate was resistant to all eight antimicrobial classes routinely tested: aminoglycosides, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, cephems, penicillins, folate pathway inhibitors, phenicols, quinolones, and tetracyclines. The extensively resistant isolate was from a 50-year-old woman who denied antimicrobial use, hospitalization, or international travel within 6 months. Meat (beef, chicken, and pork) and eggs were consumed within 1 month before stool collection. Further studies are warranted to understand potential sources, including the food supply, of resistant E. coli.
