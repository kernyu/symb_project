We characterized 53 OXA-48-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (OXA-48-Kp) isolated between 2011 and 2013 in 21 French hospitals. All the isolates were genotyped using MLST and PFGE and the population structure of the species was determined by a nucleotide-based analysis of the entire K. pneumoniae MLST database. Most of the OXA-48-Kp isolates also produced CTX-M-15 and remained susceptible to imipenem and meropenem. The isolates were distributed into 20 STs, of which five were dominant (ST15, ST101, ST147, ST395 and ST405). All the OXA-48-Kp clustered in the major clade of K. pneumoniae KpI.
