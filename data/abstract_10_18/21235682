The application of antimicrobials in the management of wounds is a complex procedure requiring appropriate clinical decision making, judgment and a thorough understanding of antimicrobial therapies, together with their potential disadvantages. There is considerable direct and indirect evidence for the presence of bacterial biofilms in the chronic wound bed, and it has been demonstrated that bacteria within these biofilms may exhibit both specific and nonspecific antimicrobial tolerance. The antimicrobial tolerance of biofilms is a major concern in the treatment of both infected and nonhealing chronic wounds and an understanding of the mechanisms involved is of fundamental importance in managing wound infections and developing future wound management strategies. The aim of this review is therefore to provide an overview of our current understanding of the mechanisms by which bacteria in wound biofilms can resist conventional antibiotic and antibacterial therapies which is very important to wound healing.
