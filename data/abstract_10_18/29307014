PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics and antimicrobial patterns of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia bloodstream infections (BSI) and pneumonia episodes in patients with cancer. METHODS: Patients with S. maltophilia BSI or pneumonia admitted from 1 Jan. 2000 to 31 Dec. 2016 were identified at the Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia (INCan), a tertiary-care oncology hospital in Mexico City. RESULTS: During the study period, there were 171 isolates identified. The mean age of the whole group was 46.9 +/- 17.4 years; 99 (57.9%) were women. There were 95 BSI: 64 ambulatory catheter-related BSI (CRBSI), 20 nosocomial CRBSI, and 11 secondary BSI. Mortality was higher in nosocomial CRBSI (40%) vs. that in ambulatory CRBSI (7.8%) (p = 0.001). There were 76 pneumonia episodes; all were nosocomial acquired; 46 (60.5%) ventilator-associated. From all the group, nine strains (5.2%) were resistant to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim/(SMX/TMP). At the first month, 54 patients (31.6%) have died, 38 due to pneumonia (70%) and 16 due to BSI (30%, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that removal of central venous catheter was associated with a favorable outcome in patients with bacteremia. For patients with pneumonia, age >/= 65 years and inappropriate antimicrobial treatment were risk factors associated with 30-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: S. maltophilia related with ambulatory CRBSI have a better prognosis than other sources of BSI. Older patients with pneumonia who do not receive appropriate antibiotics have higher mortality. SMX/TMP is still the antibiotic of choice.
