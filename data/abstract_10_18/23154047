INTRODUCTION: Acinetobacter spp. have emerged as notorious pathogens involved in healthcare-associated infections. Carbapenems are important antimicrobial agents for treating infections due to multidrug resistant Acinetobacter spp. Different mechanisms may confer resistance to these drugs in the genus, particularly production of class D carbapenemases. OXA-23-like family has been pointed out as one of the predominant carbapenamases among Acinetobacter. The present work aimed to investigate the occurrence of OXA-23-like carbapenemases among Acinetobacter isolates recovered from patients of a university hospital in Niteroi, RJ, Brazil. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were determined by disk-diffusion. Imipenem resistant isolates were submitted to Modified Hodge Test in order to screen for carbapenemase production, and later to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to investigate the presence of bla(OXA-23). RESULTS: Imipenem and meropenem resistance rates were 71.4% and 69.7%, respectively. The Modified Hodge Test revealed carbapenemase production among 76 (89.4%) of the 85 imipenem resistant isolates analyzed; according to PCR results, 81 isolates (95.4%) carried the bla(OXA-23) gene. CONCLUSIONS: OXA-23-like enzymes may be an important mechanism of carbapenem resistance among isolates present in the hospital studied.
