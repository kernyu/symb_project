BACKGROUND: Shigella flexneri serotype 1c emerged as a critical isolate from children in Egypt and Pakistan. The pattern of antimicrobial susceptibility (AMS) and resistance genes of this serotype have yet to be characterized. FINDINGS: Sixty nine S. flexneri 1c isolates isolates were identified from both Egypt (n-46) and Pakistan (n = 23) and tested for AMS by disk diffusion method and minimal inhibitory concentrations were also determined. Isolates were genotyped by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and five relevant resistance genes (bla(TEM), bla(SHV), bla(OXA), sulI and sulII) were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. High resistance was observed in all isolates for ampicillin (AM >96%); trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole and tetracycline (>88%). Most AM-resistant isolates from Egypt (70%) harbored bla(TEM) resistance, while 52% of isolates from Pakistan expressed bla(OXA). All isolates were closely related by PFGE, irrespective of source or time of collection. The sulII gene was present in 100% of isolates from pediatric cases in Egypt, 65% of Pakistan isolates, and 53% of isolates from older Egyptian patients. CONCLUSIONS: While different Shigella serotypes gathered in specific genotypic groups, 1c serotype isolates formed multiple clusters. Although AMS was considerably high to most commonly used drugs, genetic determinants were variable between countries over time. The data stress the need for a more careful selection of antibiotics in the treatment of shigellosis.
