Emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria is important in solid organ transplant recipients, because it can jeopardize patient and graft survival. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections are not rare in kidney transplant recipients. On the other hand, infections related to community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) strains are seldom reported in the literature. Herein, we report the first patient, to our knowledge, with CA-MRSA renal graft abscess who was successfully treated with drainage and parenteral antibiotics.
