Virus resistance to antiviral therapies is an increasing concern that makes the development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs urgent. Targeting of the viral envelope, a component shared by a large number of viruses, emerges as a promising strategy to overcome this problem. Natural and synthetic porphyrins are good candidates for antiviral development due to their relative hydrophobicity and pro-oxidant character. In the present work, we characterized the antiviral activities of protoprophyrin IX (PPIX), Zn-protoporphyrin IX (ZnPPIX), and mesoporphyrin IX (MPIX) against vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and evaluated the mechanisms involved in this activity. Treatment of VSV with PPIX, ZnPPIX, and MPIX promoted dose-dependent virus inactivation, which was potentiated by porphyrin photoactivation. All three porphyrins inserted into lipid vesicles and disturbed the viral membrane organization. In addition, the porphyrins also affected viral proteins, inducing VSV glycoprotein cross-linking, which was enhanced by porphyrin photoactivation. Virus incubation with sodium azide and alpha-tocopherol partially protected VSV from inactivation by porphyrins, suggesting that singlet oxygen ((1)O2) was the main reactive oxygen species produced by photoactivation of these molecules. Furthermore, (1)O2 was detected by 9,10-dimethylanthracene oxidation in photoactivated porphyrin samples, reinforcing this hypothesis. These results reveal the potential therapeutic application of PPIX, ZnPPIX, and MPIX as good models for broad antiviral drug design.
