BACKGROUND: Various studies have indicated Escherichia coli to be the most prevalent pathogen isolated in urine specimens. OBJECTIVES: This study was therefore conducted to find out whether the same holds in this environment. The study will also determine the resistance pattern of uropathogenic Escherichia coli isolates to available antibiotics. METHODS: Two hundred consecutive urine samples collected from patients with clinical diagnosis of urinary tract infections (UTI) and which have significant bacteriuria were included in this study. These were analysed using standard bacteriological techniques. Escherichia coli isolated from the urine specimens were subjected to antibiotic susceptibility testing because many cases of resistance to commonly available antibiotics here have been encountered in the course of management of patients with UTI. RESULTS: Klebsiella species (40%) were found to be the most prevalent uropathogen in this environment, followed by E. coli (25%), Staphylococcus aureus (25%), Proteus species (4%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.5%), and Enterococcus faecalis (3.5%). Resistance of E. coli to antibiotics commonly used in our environment for UTI, namely, amoxicillin/ clavulanate, cotrimoxazole and amoxicillin were 100% each. Resistance rates to other antibiotics such as ofloxacin, gentamycin, nalidixic acid and tetracycline were 70%, 92%, 96% and 88% respectively. CONCLUSION: The high antibiotic resistance rates recorded in this study therefore calls for urgent review of existing and implementation of effective antibiotic policy in this community.
