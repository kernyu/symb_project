The present study aims to detect the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) by enterobacteria isolated from samples of fresh shrimp and fish obtained from the retail trade of the city of Sobral, Ceara State, Brazil. All bacterial isolates were submitted to identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing using aminopenicillin, beta-lactamase inhibitors, carbapenem, 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th generation cephalosporins, and monobactam. Three types of beta-lactamases - ESBL, AmpC and KPC - were investigated. 103 strains were identified, and the most frequent species in shrimp and fish samples was Enterobacter cloacae (n = 54). All the strains were resistant to penicillin and more than 50% of the isolates were resistant to ampicillin and cephalothin. Resistance to three 3rd generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime) and one fourth generation cephalosporin (cefepime) was detected in two isolates of E. cloacae from shrimp samples. Phenotypic detection of AmpC was confirmed in seven strains. The ESBL was detected in two strains of E. cloacae from shrimp samples. No strain showed KPC production. These data can be considered alarming, since food (shrimp and fish) may be carriers of enterobacteria resistant to drugs of clinical interest.
