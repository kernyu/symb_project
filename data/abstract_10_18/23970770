The clinical utility of genotypic drug resistance testing (DRT) in HIV-infected children on antiretroviral therapy (ART) is not well understood. HIV-infected patients aged <19 years undergoing DRT for virological failure were retrospectively enrolled. Indications for DRT and changes in HIV RNA load were recorded. Between January 2000 and December 2006, 57 patients had DRT. The most common indication for DRT was poor ART adherence (57.7% of patients). ART was changed in 50.9% of patients after DRT. Poor adherence was cited by clinicians for not changing ART significantly more often than any other reason (47.3%, P < 0.001). After DRT, significant improvement in HIV RNA load occurred independent of ART changes, though patients whose ART was modified were more likely to become undetectable (31.5% versus 7.0%, P < 0.001). Poor adherence was a significant factor for ordering DRT and for not changing ART in HIV-infected children.
