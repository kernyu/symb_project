The study investigated some anticoccidial resistance for Amprol, Toltrazuril and sulfaclozine in experimental infected broiler. Eimeria identification depended on necropsy and coproscopic examination. 140 day-old chicks allotted into 7 groups and infected with Eimeria in 2nd day of age. G1: neither infected nor treated (negative control), G2: infected but not treated (positive control), Infected and treated with toltrazuril (G3), or with Amprol+Allicin (G4), or with Amprol+ethobabate (G5), or with Amprol (G6) or with Sulfaclozine (G7). Eimeria infection caused decrease in body gain, total protein, albumin but increase in FCR, ALT, AST, Uric acid, Creatinine. Treatment decreased the harmful effect of infection but some significant differences were between infected treated groups and non infected non-treated one.
