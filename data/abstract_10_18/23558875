BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to investigate the association between plasma concentrations of salicylic acid (SA) and other minor acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) metabolites and high on ASA platelet reactivity assessed with different methods in type 2 diabetic patients (T2DM). METHODS: Study cohort consisted of 293 T2DM patients on chronic ASA therapy. Platelet function inhibition was analyzed using measurements of serum thromboxane B2 (S-TxB2), VerifyNow Aspirin and Platelet Function Analyzer (PFA)-100 assays. The concentration of ASA metabolites in plasma was measured with a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). RESULTS: In logistic regression analysis both ASA dose/kg of body weight and plasma SA concentration were found to be predictive of S-TxB2 concentrations above 0.72 ng/mL cut-off point (OR 16.9, 95% CI 2.29-125.8, p = 0.006 and OR 5.34, 95% CI 2.67-10.68, p < 0.001, respectively). When using the VerifyNow Aspirin Assay, the concentrations of SA were significantly lower (p = 0.007) in the group with high on ASA platelet reactivity when compared with the group with normal on ASA platelet reactivity. In logistic regression analysis plasma SA concentration was found to be predictive of VerifyNow Aspirin Reaction Units (ARU) >/= 550 (OR 3.86, 95% CI 1.86-8.00, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that disturbances of pharmacokinetic mechanisms might contribute to lower plasma SA levels, and subsequently incomplete inhibition of thromboxane A2 synthesis as measured with S-TxB2 concentrations and increased platelet reactivity measured with VerifyNow in T2DM patients.
