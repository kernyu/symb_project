Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) belongs to commodity polymer materials applied in biomedical applications due to its favorable mechanical and chemical properties. The main disadvantage of LDPE in biomedical applications is low resistance to bacterial infections. An antibacterial modification of LDPE appears to be a solution to this problem. In this paper, the chitosan and chitosan/pectin multilayer was immobilized via polyacrylic acid (PAA) brushes grafted on the LDPE surface. The grafting was initiated by a low-temperature plasma treatment of the LDPE surface. Surface and adhesive properties of the samples prepared were investigated by surface analysis techniques. An antibacterial effect was confirmed by inhibition zone measurements of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). The chitosan treatment of LDPE led to the highest and most clear inhibition zones (35 mm(2) for E. coli and 275 mm(2) for S. aureus).
