Antimicrobial research is increasingly being focused on the problem of resistance and biofilm formation. Hamamelitannin (HAM) was recently identified as an antimicrobial potentiator for conventional antibiotics towards Staphylococcus aureus. This paper describes the synthesis and biological evaluation of novel hamamelitannin analogues with alternative central scaffolds. Via a ligand-based approach, several interesting compounds with improved synthetic accessibility were identified as potentiators for vancomycin in the treatment of MRSA infections.
