BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Shrimp culture has been expanded rapidly in recent years in coastal wetland zone of Vietnam due to favorable natural conditions. However, this industry has caused several negative impacts to the environment. One of the critical issues is the excessive application of antibiotics including human medicines. These chemicals could be released from shrimp ponds and then accumulated and contaminated of the ecosystem. This review article discusses a whole range of findings that address various aspects of the usage, occurrence and potentially environmental risks of antibiotics released from shrimp farming, with emphasis on the South Vietnam coastal wetland. METHODS: The published information on the usage and occurrence of antibiotics in Vietnamese shrimp farming has been reviewed. A global comparison was also carried out. This follows by a brief overview of the transport and fate of these antibiotics in the environment. RESULTS: Several antibiotics commonly used in Vietnamese shrimp culture have been detected in wastewater and sediment of the ponds, as well as in surrounding coastal wetlands, resulting in the existence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. However, their transport and fate could not be clearly defined. CONCLUSIONS: The well-documented accumulation of antibiotics in mud and sediments in Vietnamese coastal wetlands potentially poses serious risks for the local wetland ecosystems. Thus, research on the transport and fate of antibiotics' residues from the ponds into the surrounding environment is urgently needed.
