Growing evidence suggests that deregulation of signalling elements of Notch and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways contribute to tumorigenesis. These signals play important roles in cellular functions and malignancies. Their tumorigenic role in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) is well known; however, their potential interactions and functions are poorly characterized in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). The aim of our study was to characterize mTOR and Notch signalling elements in HL cell lines (DEV, L1236, KMH2) and human biopsies and to investigate their cross-talk in the tumorous process. High mTOR activity and constitutive NOTCH1 activation was confirmed in HL cell lines, without any known oncogenic mutations in key elements, including those common to both pathways. The anti-tumour effect of Notch inhibitors are well known from several preclinical models but resistance and side effects occur in many cases. Here, we tested mTOR and Notch inhibitors and their combinations in gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI) resistant HL cells in vitro and in vivo. mTOR inhibitor alone or in combination was able to reduce tumour growth; furthermore, it was more effective in xenograft models in vivo. Based on these results, we suggest that constitutively activated NOTCH1 may be a potential target in HL therapy; furthermore, mTOR inhibitors may be effective for decreasing tumour growth if resistance to Notch inhibitors develop.
