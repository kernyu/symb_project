Salmonella is one of the most dangerous and common food-borne pathogens. The overuse of antibiotics for disease prevention has led to the development of multidrug resistant Salmonella. Now, more than ever, there is a need for new antimicrobial drugs to combat these resistant bacteria. Aptamers have grown in popularity since their discovery, and their properties make them attractive candidates for therapeutic use. In this work, we describe the selection of highly specific DNA aptamers to S. enteritidis and S. typhimurium. To evolve species-specific aptamers, twelve rounds of selection to live S. enteritidis and S. typhimurium were performed, alternating with a negative selection against a mixture of related pathogens. Studies have shown that synthetic pools combined from individual aptamers have the capacity to inhibit growth of S. enteritidis and S. typhimurium in bacterial cultures; this was the result of a decrease in their membrane potential.
