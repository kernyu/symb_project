Testing of rapidly growing species of mycobacteria (RGM) against antibacterial agents has been shown to have some clinical utility. This work establishes the MICs of seven antimicrobial agents following the guidelines set forth by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) against eighteen isolates of Mycobacterium massiliense recovered from wound samples of patients submitted to minimally invasive surgery such as arthroscopy and laparoscopy. The isolates showed susceptibility to amikacin (MIC(90) = 4 mug/mL) and clarithromycin (MIC(90) < 1 mug/mL) but resistance to ciprofloxacin (MIC(90) > 16 mug/mL), doxycycline (MIC(90) > 32 mug/mL), sulfamethoxazole (MIC(90) > 128 mug/mL), and tobramycin (MIC(90) = 32 mug/mL), and intermediate profile to cefoxitin (MIC(90) = 64 mug/mL). Therefore, we suggest that the antimicrobial susceptibilities of any clinically significant RGM isolate should be performed.
