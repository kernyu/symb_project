Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTI) are rare but carry high mortality rates. NSTI with Klebsiella species have been previously described as associated with Klebsiella liver abscesses and endophthalmitis. Here, we describe 6 cases of NSTI in liver transplant recipients associated with Klebsiella pneumoniae, 4 of which were K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae (CRKP). Increased awareness of this emerging pathogen and its association with necrotizing skin and soft tissue infection is critical, as early recognition and debridement may improve survival. Antimicrobial treatment of CRKP infections remains an ongoing challenge and implementation of enhanced infection control measures is essential.
