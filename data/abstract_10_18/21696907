The in vitro activity of the novel antifungal agent E1210 and four comparators (caspofungin, fluconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole) was determined against 90 clinical isolates of Candida using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute methods. The collection was composed of 21 Candida albicans, 20 C. glabrata, 25 C. parapsilosis, and 24 C. tropicals, and also included 21 fluconazole-resistant and 15 caspofungin-resistant strains. E1210 was highly active against all the species tested and was more potent than all comparators. The MIC(90) results (mug/mL) for E1210, caspofungin, fluconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole, respectively, were as follows by species: C. albicans (0.06, 4, >/=64, 0.5, 0.5), C. glabrata (0.06, 2, 32, 1, 1), C. parapsilosis (0.06, 4, 16, 0.12, 0.25), and C. tropicalis (0.06, 4, >/=64, 0.5, 2). E1210 was also the most active agent against fluconazole-resistant strains of C. albicans (MIC range, 0.015-0.12 mug/mL), C. glabrata (0.06 mug/mL), C. parapsilosis (MIC range, 0.06-0.05 mug/mL), and C. tropicalis (MIC range, 0.008-0.06 mug/mL), and was the most potent agent tested against caspofungin-resistant strains of C. albicans (MIC range, 0.008-0.12 mug/mL), C. glabrata (MIC range, 0.03-0.06 mug/mL), and C. tropicalis (MIC range, 0.015-0.06 mug/mL).
