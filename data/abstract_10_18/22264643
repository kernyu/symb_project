Given the significance of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections for both horses and staff in equine veterinary hospitals, protocols are required to minimise the risk of nosocomial transmission, including the screening of the skin and nasal chambers of equine patients for evidence of infection. The objective of this study was to clarify the potential existence and extent of MRSA on the skin of horses requiring long-term hospitalisation (>/= 6 months). Thirty such horses were sampled at eight different locations on their skin and from their nasal chambers. MRSA was isolated from 12 animals (40%), with all sample sites testing positive on at least one occasion. Organisms were most frequently detected in the nasal chambers (relative sensitivity, 83.3%; 34.5% positive horses; isolation rate 33.3%). Skin presence was found in 30% of animals with the highest isolation rates found at the carpus (16.7%), neck, withers and croup (13.3% each). To achieve a relative screening sensitivity of >90%, at least one skin site was required in addition to nasal sampling. This evidence of skin as well as nasal reservoirs of MRSA in long-term hospitalised horses should facilitate the design of effective screening and containment protocols.
