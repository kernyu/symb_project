OBJECTIVES: Dolutegravir is a second-generation integrase strand transfer inhibitor (InSTI) that has been recently approved by the FDA to treat antiretroviral therapy-naive as well as treatment-experienced HIV-infected individuals, including those already exposed to the first-generation InSTI. Despite having a different mutational profile, some cross-resistance mutations may influence its susceptibility. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of a raltegravir-containing salvage regimen on dolutegravir activity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Blood samples of 92 HIV-infected individuals with virological failure (two or more viral loads >50 copies/mL after 6 months of treatment) using raltegravir with optimized background therapy were sequenced and evaluated according to the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database algorithm. RESULTS: Among the 92 patients analysed, 32 (35%) showed resistance to dolutegravir, in most cases associated with the combination of Q148H/R/K with G140S/A mutations. At genotyping, patients with resistance to dolutegravir had viral load values closer to the highest previously documented viral load. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in viraemia during virological failure may indicate the evolution of raltegravir resistance and may predict the emergence of secondary mutations that are associated with a decrease in dolutegravir susceptibility. Early discontinuation of raltegravir from failing regimens might favour subsequent salvage with dolutegravir, but further studies are necessary to evaluate this issue.
