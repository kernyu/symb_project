Nematodes are believed to have originated 1000 million years ago as free living anaerobic benthic organisms. Modern anthelmintic drugs have been in use but the worms have created resistance to most of the broad spectrum anthelmintics such as benzimidazoles, levamisole, avermectins, etc. However, these drugs cause side effects. More recently, plant extracts have been reported as having developed resistance against anthelmintics. A study using earthworms to determine the activity has been developed and explained in a well-defined manner in this chapter.
