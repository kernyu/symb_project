Inhaled antimicrobials have been extremely beneficial in treating respiratory infections, particularly chronic infections in a lung with cystic fibrosis. The pulmonary delivery of antibiotics has been demonstrated to improve treatment efficacy, reduce systemic side effects and, critically, reduce drug exposure to commensal bacteria compared with systemic administration, reducing selective pressure for antimicrobial resistance. This review will explore the specific challenges of pulmonary delivery of a number of differing antimicrobial molecules, and the formulation and technological approaches that have been used to overcome these difficulties. It will also explore the future challenges being faced in the development of inhaled products and respiratory infection treatment, and identify future directions of innovation, with a particular focus on respiratory infections caused by multiple drug-resistant pathogens.
