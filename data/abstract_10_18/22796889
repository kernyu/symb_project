OBJECTIVES: To detect carbapenemases in clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae collected from patients in a university hospital in Thailand between October 2010 and August 2011. METHODS: A total of 4818 Enterobacteriaceae isolates were screened for the presence of carbapenemases by ertapenem and imipenem disc diffusion tests. All positive screening isolates were subjected to modified Hodge test, phenylboronic acid- and EDTA-carbapenem combined disc tests and two multiplex PCRs of bla(IMP), bla(VIM), bla(SPM), bla(SIM) and bla(GIM), and of bla(KPC), bla(NDM) and bla(OXA-48). Carbapenemase-producing isolates were typed by PFGE and then characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility tests. Conjugation was performed using a broth culture mating method. RESULTS: Two isolates each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Citrobacter freundii produced NDM-1, whereas two other isolates of K. pneumoniae produced IMP-14a. DNA fingerprints revealed that the metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing isolates were of different strains except for clonal strains of C. freundii. In vitro transfer of carbapenem resistance was successful for the eight MBL-producing isolates. All MBL producers were susceptible to colistin and tigecycline. The six NDM-producing isolates were recovered from the urine of three patients, who had no history of travel outside Thailand. Interestingly, one patient had chronic urinary tract infections caused by a K. pneumoniae strain and two strains of E. coli producing NDM-1. CONCLUSIONS: Surveillance of carbapenemases, particularly NDM-1, in Enterobacteriaceae is urgently needed to control and prevent the spread of these resistance determinants in our country.
