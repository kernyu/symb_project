Resistance to IFN-I-induced antineoplastic effects has been reported in many tumors and arises, in part, from epigenetic silencing of IFN-stimulated genes by DNA methylation. We hypothesized that restoration of IFN-stimulated genes by co-administration of the demethylating drug 5-aza-2'-deoxycitidine (decitabine [DAC]) may enhance the susceptibility to IFN-I-mediated antitumoral effects in melanoma. We show that combined administration of IFN-I and DAC significantly inhibits the growth of murine and human melanoma cells, both in vitro and in vivo. Compared with controls, DAC/IFN-I-treated melanoma cells exhibited reduced cell growth, augmented apoptosis, and diminished migration. Moreover, IFN-I and DAC synergized to suppress the growth of three-dimensional human melanoma spheroids, altering tumor architecture. These direct antitumor effects correlated with induction of the IFN-stimulated gene Mx1. In vivo, DAC/IFN-I significantly reduced melanoma growth via stimulation of adaptive immunity, promoting tumor-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells while inhibiting the homing of immunosuppressive CD11b(+) myeloid cells and regulatory T cells. Accordingly, exposure of human melanoma cells to DAC/IFN-I induced the recruitment of immune cells toward the tumor in a Matrigel (Corning Life Sciences, Kennebunkport, ME)-based microfluidic device. Our findings underscore a beneficial effect of DAC plus IFN-I combined treatment against melanoma through both direct and immune-mediated anti-tumor effects.
