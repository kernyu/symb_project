Malignant melanoma biologically can be divided into non-metastatic and metastatic forms which cannot be predicted precisely using classical clinicopathological parameters, therefore studies on novel genetic or protein markers are abundant in the literature. These studies did not result in clinically useful markers because mostly ignored the results of studies on the genetic basis of metastatic potential of malignant melanoma. Accordingly, the list of promising novel markers is short (BCL2, CDK2, MART-1, OPN). Similar to other solid malignancies, introduction of targeted therapy into clinical practice of melanoma turned the attention toward the genetic basis of resistance to chemo- and targeted therapies. These novel data could lead to the development of molecular diagnostics which can help in designing more effective therapeutic strategies of malignant melanoma.
