UNLABELLED: S. aureus is capable of producing a wide spectrum of diseases and can quickly develop resistance to antibiotics. These features require a careful monitoring of these organisms, by detection of resistance genes and virulence factors, such as Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL). AIM: To determine the presence of mecA and pvl genes in S. aureus isolates by a Real Time-PCR technique (RT-PCR) in order to shorten the detection time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We tested 119 strains isolated from pus, using phenotypic methods for methicillin resistance characterization, according to CLSI 2008-2010 guidelines. Detection of mecA and pvl genes was done with hydrolysis probes. RESULTS: The prevalence rate of methicilin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was 40,33%, and pvl was detected in 52,08% of those strains. The results of the conventional methods for methicillin resistance detection were validated by those obtained by RT-PCR CONCLUSIONS: RT-PCR is useful in epidemiological surveillance of MRSA and PVL-producing strains and validation of test results for phenotypic resistance to oxacillin.
