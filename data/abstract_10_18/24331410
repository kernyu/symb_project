OBJECTIVES: Although nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt-mTOR comprise key pathways, their interrelationship in lung cancer cell survival is poorly understood and needs further analyses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined the activation of the NF-kappaB and Akt-mTORC1-p70 S6 kinase (S6K) pathways and the effect of inhibitors for NF-kappaB, mTORC1, and Akt using fresh lung adenocarcinoma cells. RESULTS: The cases used for this study showed constitutive NF-kappaB activity; however, all cases but one showed resistance to NF-kappaB inhibition. Further examination revealed that the resistant cases were also active in the Akt-mTORC1-S6K pathway. These cases were insensitive to mTORC1 inhibition but sensitive to Akt inhibition. Akt inhibition recovered sensitivity to NF-kappaB inhibition and dual inhibition showed a synergistic effect on apoptosis induction. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the activation of Akt involves resistance to NF-kappaB inhibition and both pathways synergistically support the survival of lung adenocarcinoma cells. The results also indicate that inhibition of the mTORC1-S6K pathway does not inhibit the survival of these cells.
