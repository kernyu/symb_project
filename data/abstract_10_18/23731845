Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a leading cause of corneal blindness. Acyclovir (ACV) constitutes the standard treatment of HSV infections including herpetic keratitis (HK). HSV resistance to ACV is mainly described in immunocompromised patients. We describe two cases of ACV-resistant corneal HSV-1 in immunocompetent individuals with recurrent HK.
