PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review presents current data regarding the use of collagen cross-linking in the management of corneal infections. Infectious keratitis can lead to blindness without proper antimicrobial therapy. The disease can still progress and lead to corneal melt despite early detection and management. The aggressive nature of corneal pathogens and the threat of antibiotic-resistance make it necessary to develop newer ways of managing this rapidly progressive condition. RECENT FINDINGS: Collagen cross-linking is a noninvasive ocular surface procedure that is used to effectively strengthen the cornea. This technique presents as a novel treatment option to halt the progression of keratoconus and ectasia. More recently, however, several articles have demonstrated the effectiveness of cross-linking in treating infectious keratitis via direct microbiologic cure and possibly, inhibition of corneal enzymatic degradation by common pathogenic organisms. SUMMARY: Current literature reveals that corneal collagen cross-linking holds promise in treating infectious keratitis. However, larger-scale, randomized, controlled trials comparing cross-linking to standard antibiotic therapy are still warranted to support these findings.
