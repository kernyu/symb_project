AIMS: The present study was designed to assess the phenotypic traits and virulence determinants of vegetables/fruits-origin E. coli and Salmonella strains. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 520 fresh vegetables/fruits samples were analyzed for the presence of E. coli, including Shiga-toxin producing E. coli (STEC), and Salmonella. The vegetables/fruits-origin E. coli and Salmonella strains were further assessed for antimicrobial resistance, biofilm formation, extracellular matrix production, and in-vitro invasion/intracellular survivability assays. A total of 73 E. coli, including 4 STEC, and 26 Salmonella strains were recovered from vegetables/fruits in the present study. Most of the E. coli and Salmonella isolates were able to form biofilm with higher production of cellulose/curli-fimbriae. Further, more resistance was observed in E. coli isolates (61.6%) than in Salmonella isolates (38.5%) against tested antimicrobials. Additionally, invasion/intracellular survival results showed that majority of the E. coli and Salmonella isolates were able to efficiently invade/replicate intracellularly in the human epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that vegetables/fruits-origin E. coli and Salmonella significantly exhibited distinct phenotypic/virulence traits which could be linked to their plant-associated lifestyle with food safety issues. SIGNIFICANCE: The present study provides valuable baseline information that E. coli and Salmonella may use plants as alternative host with significant clinical importance.
