Antimicrobial susceptibilities of contemporary Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates were determined from the CAPITAL 2010 surveillance program. Isolates were collected from 100 sites throughout the USA and Puerto Rico, and included isolates representing a range of patient demographics and infection types. A total of 2722 isolates were tested for susceptibility to a broad spectrum of agents, with susceptibilities ranging from 98.8% for colistin to 74% for levofloxacin. Doripenem was the most active carbapenem agent, with 88.6% of isolates susceptible, in comparison with 78.1% and 84.6% for imipenem and meropenem, respectively. Lower respiratory tract isolates and isolates from the intensive care unit setting were the least susceptible overall. Resistance rates were typically highest in lower respiratory tract isolates, with the exception of urinary tract isolates, which displayed the highest resistance for levofloxacin. Overall, multidrug-resistant isolates comprised 14.8% of the total sample population.
