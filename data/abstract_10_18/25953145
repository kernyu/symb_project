We evaluated a new phenotypic test for carbapenemase detection. A total of 100 Enterobacteriaceae isolates were selected. The test was compared with conventional PCR for bla(KPC) and bla(NDM) detection. We found 100% sensitivity and specificity, suggesting that this test may be a feasible alternative for rapid carbapenemase detection.
