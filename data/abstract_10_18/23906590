Laribacter hongkongensis is a food-borne bacterium associated with community-acquired gastroenteritis and diarrhoea. Quinolone resistance was recently reported in bacterial isolates from aquatic products, but the molecular mechanisms for resistance were still unknown. In this study, a total of 157 L. hongkongensis strains were isolated from grass carps (n = 443) and Chinese tiger frogs (n = 171). Twenty-one ciprofloxacin-resistant strains were analysed for mutations in quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDR), acquired quinolone resistance (AQR) genes and the role of efflux pumps in resistance. All QRDR mutations in gyrA (codons 85 and 89) and parC (codons 83 and 231) were found to be closely associated with ciprofloxacin resistance. The AQR gene aac(6')-Ib-cr was found in 42.9% (9/21) of the resistant strains, but qnrA, qnrB, qnrC, qnrD, qnrS and qepA were not detected. No significant change of MICs to ciprofloxacin was observed in the presence of an efflux pump inhibitor, indicating the role of efflux pump was probably absent. All 21 ciprofloxacin-resistant strains showed different electrophoretic patterns, which suggested they were not genetically related. These data highlight the importance of QRDR mutations and the AQR gene aac(6')-Ib-cr during the development of quinolone resistance in a heterogeneous population of L. hongkongensis.
