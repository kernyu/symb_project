Epidemiological data on carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria on the African continent are limited. Here, we report the identification of VIM-2-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates in Tanzania. Eight out of 90 clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa from a tertiary care hospital in Dar es Salaam were shown to harbor bla(VIM-2). The bla(VIM-2)-positive isolates belonged to two different sequence types (ST), ST244 and ST640, with bla(VIM-2) located in an unusual integron structure lacking the 3' conserved region of qacDeltaE1-sul1.
