All cells are subjected to oxidative stress, a condition under which reactive oxygen species (ROS) production exceeds elimination. Bacterial defences against ROS include synthesis of antioxidant enzymes like peroxidases and catalases. Vibrio cholerae can produce two distinct catalases, KatB and KatG, which contribute to ROS homeostasis. In this study, we analysed the mechanism behind katG and katB expression in two V. cholerae O1 pandemic strains, O395 and N16961, of classical and El Tor biotypes, respectively. Both strains express these genes, especially at stationary phase. However, El Tor N16961 produces higher KatB and KatG levels and is much more resistant to peroxide challenge than the classical strain, confirming a direct relationship between catalase activity and oxidative stress resistance. Moreover, we showed that katG and katB expression levels depend on inorganic phosphate (Pi) availability, in contrast to other bacterial species. In N16961, katB and katG expression is reduced under Pi limitation relative to Pi abundance. Total catalase activity in N16961 and its phoB mutant cells was similar, independently of growth conditions, indicating that the PhoB/PhoR system is not required for katB and katG expression. However, N16961 cells from Pi-limited cultures were 50-100-fold more resistant to H2O2 challenge and accumulated less ROS than phoB mutant cells. Together, these findings suggest that, besides KatB and KatG, the PhoB/PhoR system is an important protective factor against ROS in V. cholerae N16961. They also corroborate previous results from our and other groups, suggesting that the PhoB/PhoR system is fundamental for V. cholerae biology.
