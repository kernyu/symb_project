The mechanism for improved therapeutic efficacy of the combination therapy with nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nAb-PTX) and gemcitabine (gem) for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has been ascribed to enhanced gem transport by nAb-PTX. Here, we used an orthotopic mouse model of gem-resistant human PDAC in which increasing gem transport would not improve the efficacy, thus revealing the importance of nAb-PTX transport. We aimed to evaluate therapeutic outcomes and transport of nAb-PTX to PDAC as a result of (1) encapsulating nAb-PTX in multistage nanovectors (MSV); (2) effect of gem on caveolin-1 expression. Treatment with MSV/nAb-PTX + gem was highly efficient in prolonging animal survival in comparison to other therapeutic regimens. MSV/nAb-PTX + gem also caused a substantial increase in tumor PTX accumulation, significantly reduced tumor growth and tumor cell proliferation, and increased apoptosis. Moreover, gem enhanced caveolin-1 expression in vitro and in vivo, thereby improving transport of nAb-PTX to PDAC. This data was confirmed by analysis of PDACs from patients who received gem-based neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. In conclusion, we found that nAb-PTX treatment of gem-resistant PDAC can be enhanced by (1) gem through up-regulation of caveolin-1 and (2) MSV through increasing accumulation of nAb-PTX in the tumor.
