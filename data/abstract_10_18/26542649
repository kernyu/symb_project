BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to describe clinical characteristics of Salmonella bacteremia in adult patients and analyze ciprofloxacin-nonsusceptible isolates. METHODS: A total of 101 Salmonella blood isolates from adult patients were collected from January 2011 to December 2013 in MacKay Memorial Hospital. Eight ciprofloxacin-nonsusceptible Salmonella blood isolates were screened for carbapenemase and other beta lactamase genes. Isolates were examined by PCR for the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) of all subunits for DNA gyrase (gyrA and gyrB) genes and topoisomerase IV (parC and parE) genes. RESULTS: There were 22 (21.78%) S. enterica serovar B, 5 (4.95%) S. enterica serovar C1, 7 (6.93%) S. enterica serovar C2, 65 (64.36%) S. enterica serovar D, and 2 (1.98%) S. enterica serovar Typhi (S. typhi) isolates. beta-lactamase gene screening and sequencing yielded only one blaCMY-2-positive isolate. In multivariate risk factor analysis, renal insufficiency [odds ratio (OR) 3.774; p = 0.020] and heart disease (OR 2.922; p = 0.027) were more common among elderly patients (>/=65 years). Independent risk factors for ciprofloxacin-nonsusceptible strains included S. enterica serovar C2 (OR 28.430; p = 0.032), renal insufficiency (OR 13.927; p = 0.032), and immunosuppression agent usage (OR 60.082; p = 0.006). 87.50% (7/8) of isolates had gyrA mutation, 62.50% (5/8) had parC mutation, and none had gyrB and parE mutations. Isolates with both Ser83Phe/Asp87Asn gyrA and Thr57Ser/Ser80Ile parC mutation genes were highly ciprofloxacin-resistant (minimum inhibitory concentration >/=4 mg/L). CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients with renal insufficiency and heart disease were at risk for Salmonella bacteremia. Those for ciprofloxacin-nonsusceptible strains included S. enterica serovar C2, renal insufficiency, and immunosuppression agent usage. The 8 ciprofloxacin-nonsusceptible isolates carried gyrA and parC mutations, which cause resistance that poses a major concern.
