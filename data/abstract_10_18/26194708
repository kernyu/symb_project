The acquisition of plasmids has led to a significant increase in antimicrobial resistance within the staphylococci. In order to study these plasmids effectively, one must be able move the plasmid DNA into genetically clean backgrounds. While the smaller staphylococcal class I (1-5 kb) and class II (10-30 kb) plasmids are readily transferred using bacteriophage transduction or electroporation, these methods are inefficient at moving the larger class III (30-60 kb) plasmids. This review describes methods to transfer class III plasmids via conjugative mobilization.
