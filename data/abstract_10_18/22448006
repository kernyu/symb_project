Emergence of resistance is a major concern in influenza antiviral treatment and prophylaxis. Combination antiviral therapy might overcome this problem. Here, we estimate that all possible single mutants and a sizeable fraction of double mutants are generated during an uncomplicated influenza infection. While most of them may sustain a fitness cost, some variants may confer drug resistance and be selected during therapy. We argue that a triple combination regimen would markedly reduce the risk of antiviral resistance emergence in seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses, especially in seriously ill or immunocompromised hosts.
