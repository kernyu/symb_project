New and active infections of tuberculosis continue to increase globally. Although antibiotic susceptible infections can be readily cured with isoniazide and rifampicin, infections resistant to these two antibiotics, named Multi-Drug Resistant TB (MDR TB), are problematic for therapy, extol high costs in terms of human suffering and finances, and when these MDR infections progress to Extensive Drug Resistant TB (XDR TB) status, they are not only difficult to treat, they produce high levels of mortality regardless of therapeutic modality employed. The neuroleptic thioridazine (TZ) has been shown to have wide spectrum in vitro and ex vivo activities against antibiotic susceptible, MDR and XDR strains, and has been successfully used for curing mice of active tuberculosis produced by antibiotic susceptible and MDR strains, and has cured 10 out of 12 XDR TB patients when used in combination with three antibiotics to which the XDR TB patients were non-responsive. Mycobacterium tuberculosis TZ has been recommended for "Compassionate Therapy" of MDR/XDR TB infections whose prognoses are significantly serious and anticipated to result in mortality. This review of TZ activity and its potential to cure MDR/XDR TB supports the contention that this neuroleptic offers patenting opportunities for "New Use". The motivation for patents therefore is expected to rapidly bring TZ to the forefront for therapy of MDR/XDR TB and therefore, the striving for new patents is expected to contribute to the prevention of new infections of antibiotic resistant tuberculosis.
