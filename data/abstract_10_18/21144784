Owing to rising drug-resistant Helicobacter species infections in people and animals, currently therapies are losing their efficacy; therefore, regimens efficacious in the presence of drug resistance are needed. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of a 14-day quadruple Helicobacter species therapy in cats with naturally acquired infection. Thirteen asymptomatic adult stray cats with Helicobacter species infection (identified by analysis of gastric biopsies using polymerase chain reaction and Helicobacter-specific primers) received omeprazole 0.7mg/kg q 8h plus amoxicillin 20mg/kg q 12h, metronidazole 20mg/kg q 12h and clarithromycin 7.5mg/kg q 12h, for 14 days. Second molecular analysis of gastric biopsies revealed persistence of Helicobacter species DNA in four cats that were negative on quantitative urease testing, cytology and histopathology. Our results suggest that antibiotic regimens that are effective against Helicobacter pylori in people cannot eradicate Helicobacter species in cats with naturally acquired infection, although transient suppression may occur.
