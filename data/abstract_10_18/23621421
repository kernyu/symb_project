The prevalence of drug resistance associated with the failure of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimens and the predictors of resistance to Etravirine (ETR) were assessed in 2854 subjects: 39 < 18 (paediatric) and 2815 >/= 18 (adult) years old. These subjects failed to respond to their current NNRTI treatment, were three-class experienced and had been exposed to NNRTI for >/=3 months. A total of 1827 adult (64.9%) and 32 paediatric subjects (82.1%) harboured the virus with at least one ETR mutation. V179I, Y181C and G190A were the most frequent mutations in both groups. A significantly increased risk of ETR resistance with all three algorithms (Monogram (MGR) >3, Tibotec (TBT) >2 and enhanced MGR (ENH) >/=4) emerged in the paediatric population. Multivariate analysis revealed an increased risk of developing TBT >2 for NNRTI exposure, ENH >/=4 for NNRTI and EFV exposure in paediatric subjects; NVP exposure and higher (>/=3.5 log10) HIV-RNA values for all three algorithms in adult subjects, whereas CD4 >/= 200/muL appeared to be protective. The risk of being ETR resistant was more than doubled for paediatric vs. adult subjects, probably due to a more extensive use of NNRTI and an incomplete virological control.
