Osteosarcoma is a common primary bone tumor in children and adolescents. The drug resistance of osteosarcoma leads to high lethality. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an inflammation-related cytokine implicated in the chemoresistance of breast cancer. In this study, we isolated a novel androstenedione derivative identified as 3,4-dihydroxy-9,10-secoandrosta-1,3,5,7-tetraene-9,17-dione (DSTD). DSTD could inhibit MIF expression in MG-63 and U2OS cells. The inhibition of MIF by DSTD promoted autophagy by inducing Bcl-2 downregulation and the translocation of HMGB1. N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and 3-methyladenine (3-MA) attenuated DSTD-induced autophagy but promoted cell death, suggesting that DSTD induced ROS-mediated autophagy to rescue cell death. However, in the presence of chemotherapy drugs, DSTD enhanced the chemosensitivity by decreasing the HMGB1 level. Our data suggest MIF inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for overcoming drug resistance in osteosarcoma.
