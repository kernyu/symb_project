The dynamics of expression of PR1 and PR6 genes, which are involved in the defense response of plants infected with the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita, was studied in the "tomato-root-knot nematode" parasitic system. The invasion of the resistant plants was accompanied by an increased accumulation of transcripts of PR genes, which reflects their fast response to the penetration of nematode juveniles with subsequent development of an adequate defense response. In the susceptible plants, changes in the PR1 and PR6 gene activity induced by the nematode invasion were insignificant, which may be one of the causes of the disease. An exogenous salicylic acid treatment of the susceptible plants increased the PR1 and PR6 genes activity and led to the development of resistance of these plants to nematode invasion.
