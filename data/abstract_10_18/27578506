BACKGROUND: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are important pathogens causing nosocomial infections in Korean hospitals. This study aimed to investigate the epidemiological and genetic diversity of clinical S. aureus isolates in healthcare settings from 2001 to 2008. METHODS: Samples and data were obtained from 986 individuals as part of the National Antimicrobial Surveillance Project, involving 10 regions nationwide. Molecular typing studies, including multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing were performed, and a representative clone of Korean MRSA was classified by combinational grouping using a DiversiLab (DL; bioMerieux, France) repetitive element polymerase chain reaction (rep-PCR) system. RESULTS: Nine Korean MRSA clones (KMRSA-1 to -9) were identified by analysis of genetic backgrounds and molecular characteristics. KMRSA-1 to -3, expressing clonal complex (CC) 5 (carrying SCCmec II), CC8 (carrying SCCmec III), and CC72 (carrying SCCmec IV) were spread nationwide. In contrast, KMRSA-6 was highly prevalent in Gyeongsangnam-do, and KMRSA-4 was highly prevalent in Jeollanam-do and Jeollabuk-do. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemic KMRSA clones were genetically similar to major clones identified from the USA, with the exception of KMRSA-2, which had the SCCmec III type. Our results provide important insights into the distribution and molecular genetics of MRSA strains in Korea and may aid in the monitoring of MRSA spread throughout the country.
