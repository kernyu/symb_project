Glyoxal oxidase (GLOX), an extracellular H(2)O(2)-producing enzyme, has been reported in Phanerochaete chrysosporium and Ustilago maydis. We previously isolated a grapevine GLOX gene from the highly resistant to Erysiphe necator Chinese wild Vitis pseudoreticulata accession Baihe-35-1 and designated it as VpGLOX (GenBank accession no. DQ201181). Transient expression of VpGLOX can suppress Powdery Mildew in susceptible genotype were studied. To further investigate the function of the VpGLOX gene, real-time PCR and Western blot analysis were performed to examine expression patterns at transcriptional and translational levels, respectively. The results showed that VpGLOX expression at the transcriptional level increased significantly in the disease-resistant accession Baihe-35-1 after Erysiphe necator inoculation, but no significant changes in the susceptible accession, V. pseudoreticulata accession Guangxi-2 could be observed. As evident from a Western blot analysis, VpGLOX protein increased slightly in Baihe-35-1 after E. necator inoculation, but not statistical significant difference changes in Guangxi-2. The immunolocalization via immunogold electron microscopy showed that VpGLOX was mainly located in the adaxial epidermal cell wall of E. necator-inoculated leaves of both Baihe-35-1 and Guangxi-2. Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression assays revealed that VpGLOX expression could produce H(2)O(2), which may directly play a role in defense mechanism during plant-pathogen interactions. Our results could provide further insight into the biological role of VpGLOX in the defense response against E. necator in V. pseudoreticulata.
