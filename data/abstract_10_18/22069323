Human LL-37 is a multifunctional antimicrobial peptide that promotes inflammation, angiogenesis, wound healing, and tumor metastasis. Most effects of LL-37 are mediated via the activation of the cell surface G protein-coupled receptor FPR2 on leukocytes and endothelial cells. Although LL-37 induces chemotaxis, degranulation, and chemokine production in mast cells, the receptor involved and the mechanism of its regulation remain unknown. MrgX2 is a member of Mas-related genes that is primarily expressed in human dorsal root ganglia and mast cells. We found that a human mast cell line LAD2 and CD34(+) cell-derived primary mast cells, which natively express MrgX2, responded to LL-37 for sustained Ca(2+) mobilization and substantial degranulation. However, an immature human mast cell line, HMC-1, that lacks functional MrgX2 did not respond to LL-37. shRNA-mediated knockdown of MrgX2 in LAD2 mast cell line and primary CD34(+) cell-derived mast cells caused a substantial reduction in LL-37-induced degranulation. Furthermore, mast cell lines stably expressing MrgX2 responded to LL-37 for chemotaxis, degranulation, and CCL4 production. Surprisingly, MrgX2 was resistant to LL-37-induced phosphorylation, desensitization, and internalization. In addition, shRNA-mediated knockdown of the G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRK2 and GRK3) had no effect on LL-37-induced mast cell degranulation. This study identified MrgX2 as a novel G protein-coupled receptor for the antibacterial peptide LL-37 and demonstrated that unlike most G protein-coupled receptors it is resistant to agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation, desensitization, and internalization.
