BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among uropathogens contributes to treatment failure. Research in AMR among uropathogens is important to establish treatment. The aim of this study was to assess global research trends in AMR among uropathogens. METHODS: Sciverse Scopus was used to retrieve relevant documents for the period from 2002 to 2016. Only journal articles were included in the analysis. Analysis of author keywords was carried out using VOSviewer. RESULTS: A total of 1087 journal articles were retrieved with an h-index of 50. Number of publications increased noticeably in the past decade. Analysis of subject areas of retrieved documents showed that 275 (25.3%) articles were in molecular biology/genetics/microbiology/immunology, 197 (18.1%) articles were in pharmacological/therapeutic approach for treatment of UTI, and 615 (56.6%) articles were in epidemiology/public health. Terms such as multi-drug resistant and extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) appeared more frequently in documents published in the period from 2012 to 2016. The mean number of authors per article was 5.3. Most active authors in this field were from Japan. The USA ranked first with 148 (13.6%) documents followed by India (97; 8.9%) and Iran (84; 7.7%). The top productive institution was Tehran University of Medical Sciences (21 publications) followed by Kobe University in Japan (20 publications). The Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy ranked first with 33 publications. CONCLUSION: Research in AMR among uropathogens showed a noticeable increase in the past decade. Reports of increasing incidence of resistance among uropathogens were being published from different parts of the world. Empiric therapy should be based on updated research in AMR.
