Carbapenems, a more recent beta-lactam class, represent a unique anti-tuberculosis option, as emerging evidence demonstrates that they target the Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell wall and beta-lactamase. This provides a potentially new agent against M. tuberculosis, in particular for multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB), where options are limited. In this review, we examine the current evidence on the activity of carbapenems against M. tuberculosis. The predominance of work is in vitro, and suggests that carbapenems kill M. tuberculosis at least in the active phase, with possible greater potency with the addition of a beta-lactamase inhibitor. The few in vivo and clinical studies suggest that there are benefits and that they are generally tolerated, although the variability in duration, dosing, and background regimen and lack of pharmacokinetic analyses limit interpretation of efficacy. We outline further areas of research to better understand the role of carbapenems to add a needed new agent to the treatment of MDR- and XDR-TB.
