BACKGROUND/AIM: Infections are one of the most important causes of mortality and morbidity after liver transplantation as in all transplantations. Infectious complications are known to be among the preventable causes with appropriate diagnosis and treatment. So early prediction of the risk of infections will provide an effective approach to determine the local antimicrobial resistance and prevention of specific risk factors. The aim of this study was to deterimne whether specific markers are useful or not to deterimne a suspected infection in patients that have undergone liver transplantation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 65 patients with liver transplantation admitted to emergency room with suspicion of infection. These patient's CRP, procalsitonin (PCT), lactate, SAA and IL-6 levels were initially measured in the emergency department. The patients were classified to three categories according to culture results; culture-negative, culture-positive and control group. Studying parameters were investigated according to whether the culture was positive or negative in these patients. RESULTS: CRP, PCT, lactate, SAA and IL-6 levels were significanlty high in patients with suspected infeciton when compared to the control group (p<0.05). CRP, PCT and IL-6 levels were higher in the culture-positive group than in the culture-negative group and there was a significant variation (p<0.05). When suspecting an infection evaluating the parameters CRP, PCT and IL-6 was very meaningfull (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: We can use CRP, PCT, lactate, SAA and IL-6 parameters to identify presence of infection at the liver transplantation patients admitted to the emergency department with suspected infection. If CRP, PCT and IL-6 levels are significantly high we can guess the patient's positive culture.
