Mallard ducks have demonstrated to be a likely reservoir for zoonotic E. coli strains; thus, it is possible that these ducks could also act as a reservoir for other Enterobacteriaceae members. The present study was initiated to evaluate the species distribution of Enterobacteriaceae other than E. coli in 175 fresh faecal samples collected from a population of mallard ducks. Sixty-four samples displayed detectable colonies of Enterobacteriaceae (excluding E. coli), which resulted in 75 pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) types. Seventy-five single representatives of each PFGE type were subjected to identification with API 32NE and MALDI TOF MS systems due to the practical difficulties in species differentiation of Enterobacteriaceae. Those isolated were found to be from nine genera: Buttiauxella (15 %), Citrobacter (5 %), Enterobacter (32 %), Hafnia (1 %), Leclercia (1 %), Pantoea (7 %), Raoultella (21 %), Rahnella (7 %) and Serratia (11 %). Evaluation of antimicrobial resistance phenotypes using the disc method and detection of resistance genes using the microarray method revealed that these microbes possess resistance to beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, macrolides, quinolones, rifamycine, sulphonamides, streptogramins and diaminopyrimidines. In conclusion, mallard ducks harbour a variety of non-pathogenic and pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae species like Enterobacter cloacae and Enterobacter amnigenus in their intestine and could act as a reservoir of resistant Enterobacteriaceae.
