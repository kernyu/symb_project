Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important nosocomial pathogen. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of P. aeruginosa clinical isolates obtained from inpatients and outpatients at hospitals across Canada from January 2008 to December 2015 (CANWARD Study). Susceptibility testing was performed using broth microdilution, as described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. In total, 2906 P. aeruginosa isolates were evaluated. The percentage of isolates susceptible to common antipseudomonal antimicrobials was: colistin 94.9%, amikacin 93.2%, piperacillin-tazobactam 84.3%, ceftazidime 83.1%, gentamicin 82.7%, meropenem 80.5%, ciprofloxacin 76.5%. In general, susceptibility to the antipseudomonal antimicrobials tested remained fairly stable or slightly improved (ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, colistin) over the 8year study period. Multidrug-resistant (MDR = non-susceptible to at least one antimicrobial from >/=3 classes) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR = non-susceptible to at least one antimicrobial from 5 classes) P. aeruginosa accounted for 14.5% and 2.6% of the isolates, respectively. Colistin remained active against 92.9% of MDR and 88.3% of XDR P. aeruginosa.
