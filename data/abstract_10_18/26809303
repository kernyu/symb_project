Gemcitabine, a pyrimidine nucleoside analogue, is gaining recognition as a potential therapeutic agent for advanced-stage and refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). We report of 2 patients whose advanced-stage mycosis fungoides was not sufficiently controlled by prior CHOP therapy. Both patients showed great improvement in the skin lesions with weekly gemcitabine therapy (1,000-1,200 mg/m2). The patients received four and 8 cycles of gemcitabine monotherapy, respectively, and no grade 3-4 hematological or hepatic adverse events occurred. This is the first report of the efficacy of gemcitabine for CTCL in Japan. Gemcitabine is well tolerated and is an effective monotherapy for CTCL.
