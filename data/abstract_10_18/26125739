The increased incidence of fungal infections and the development of drug resistance have led to the search for microorganisms capable of producing bioactive metabolites with antifungal activity. Among these microorganisms, Streptomyces spp are distinguished mainly owing to their potential to secrete bioactive molecules. The aim of this study was to evaluate the production of secondary metabolites by Streptomyces sp TUR-10 against 12 fungal clinical isolates (yeast and filamentous fungi). In the preliminary screening, Streptomyces sp TUR-10 showed activity against 75% of the clinical isolates, and was selected for fermentation. In this assay, we tested three different media (MPE, M1, and ISP-4) for 96 h at pH 7.0 and 30 degrees C for the production of bioactive metabolites. Increased production of bioactive compounds was observed when using the MPE medium for 48 h, with good activity against Candida pelliculosa. The minimum inhibitory concentration showed significant antifungal activity values ranging from 15.6 to 250 mug/mL. The actinobacterium was characterized by 16S rRNA analysis and the pattern suggested that the isolate studied belonged to the species Streptomyces ansochromogenes. The biotechnological potential of this strain was also demonstrated by the detection of the nrps and pks genes. These results indicate the production of secondary metabolites of biotechnological interest by actinobacteria from the rhizosphere, suggesting great potential for further research.
