The establishment of high-efficiency Agrobacterium-mediated transformation techniques could improve the production of Dioscorea zingiberensis, a medicinal species with a high diosgenin content. We co-cultivated embryogenic calli induced from mature seeds with A. tumefaciens strain EHA105. A binary vector, pCAMBIA1381, which contains the gfp and hpt genes under the control of the ubiquitin promoter and the CaMV 35S promoter, respectively, was used for transformation. Pre-culture, basic medium, acetosyringone, and bacterial density were evaluated to establish the most efficient protocol. The optimal conditions consisted of MS medium without CaCl(2) for pre- and co-cultivation, three days for pre-culture, addition of 200 muM AS, and an OD(600) of 0.5. The transgenic plants grown under selection were confirmed by PCR analysis and Southern blot analysis. This protocol produced transgenic D. zingiberensis plants in seven months, with a transformation efficiency of 6%.
