With a decreasing pipeline of novel antibiotics and increasing antibacterial resistance, the need to optimise the current antibiotics in our armamentarium has become vitally important. Daptomycin is a novel lipopeptide antibiotic that exhibits concentration-dependent activity. Currently, the daptomycin dosage is 4 mg/kg/day for treatment of complicated skin and soft-tissue infections and 6 mg/kg/day for Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections, including those with right-sided endocarditis, however higher doses (>6 mg/kg/day) have been explored as a possible alternative. A comprehensive review of published data identified through a MEDLINE search of the literature from 1967-2011 and a manual search of references was performed with the primary objective of critically evaluating the safety and efficacy of high-dose daptomycin. Search results yielded two prospective trials, three retrospective reviews, case reports and in vitro simulation studies on high-dose daptomycin. To date, clinical trials, retrospective reviews, case reports and in vitro simulation models have documented the safety and tolerability of high-dose daptomycin, even when administered for a prolonged duration. Additionally, in vitro benefits observed include suppression of the emergence of daptomycin resistance and increased rapidity of bactericidal activity.
