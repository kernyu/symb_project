Enterobacter cloacae strain G6809 with reduced susceptibility to carbapenems was identified from a patient in a long-term acute care hospital in Kentucky. G6809 belonged to sequence type (ST) 88 and carried two carbapenemase genes, bla(KPC-18) and bla(VIM-1). Whole-genome sequencing localized bla(KPC-18) to the chromosome and bla(VIM-1) to a 58-kb plasmid. The strain was highly resistant to ceftazidime-avibactam. Insidious coproduction of metallo-beta-lactamase with KPC-type carbapenemase has implications for the use of next-generation beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.
