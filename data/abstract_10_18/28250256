Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains are responsible for high rates of mortality and thus pose a substantial burden to public health worldwide. Here, we investigated the antimicrobial susceptibility and molecular characteristics of MRSA isolated from child patients at Shenzhen Children's Hospital. We characterized 140 MRSA strains through antimicrobial susceptibility testing. We further performed spa typing, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) analysis, pvl gene analysis, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The analyzed MRSA strains were found to be sensitive to most non-beta-lactam antimicrobial agents. Sequence type (ST) 59 was found to be the most common MLST lineage (54.3%). Most MRSA isolates belonged to the SCCmec IV (64.3%) and V (22.8%) types. The MRSA-ST59-SCCmec IV-t437 clone was the most predominant strain that infected 28.6% of all patients studied. Moreover, 50.7% of MRSA isolates were found to be pvl-positive. We report preliminary data on the prevalence and distribution of MRSA genotypes in Shenzhen Children's Hospital. We characterized MRSA colonization dynamics in child patients in China, and our findings can serve as the basis for the development of strategies to prevent MRSA infection and transmission.
