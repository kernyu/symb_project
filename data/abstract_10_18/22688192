In this study, our aim is to compare the efficacy of different topical antibacterial agents in a rat model contaminated with a multi drug resistant (MDR) standard Acinetobacter baumannii strain. The study was carried out on 40 Sprague-Dawley rats of 250-300 g each. For the purposes of this study, the rats were divided into 5 groups, with 8 rats in each group: Group 1 control; Group 2 silver sulfadiazine; Group 3 mupirocin; Group 4 Acticoat group; and Group 5 octenidine dihydrochloride group. Following to the formation of the full-thickness burn areas in rats, the MDR A. baumannii standard strain was inoculated into the burned area. The rats in all the groups were sacrificed at the end of the 10th day and subjected to histopathological and microbiological evaluation. In the histopathological evaluation, the lowest inflammatory cell response and bacterial density in the eschar and muscle tissues were observed in the Acticoat group. While these results were found to be statistically significant compared to the silver sulfadiazine group, only the bacterial density in the muscle tissue was found as significant in comparison to the mupirocin and octenidine groups. In the microbiological evaluation, the lowest growth in the muscle tissue culture among all the groups was observed in the Acticoat group. The growth in the eschar tissue culture was significantly lower in the Acticoat and octenidine groups in comparison to the silver sulfadiazine group. At the end of the study, it has been observed that Acticoat was effective both in eschar and muscle, while octenidine was effective in eschar tissues in a rat burn model contaminated with MDR A. baumannii.
