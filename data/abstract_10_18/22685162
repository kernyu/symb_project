OBJECTIVES: To study the impact of qnrA1, qnrB19 and qnrS1 on the ciprofloxacin treatment of urinary tract infection (UTI). METHODS: From a wild-type (wt) Escherichia coli UTI isolate, three isogenic strains were constructed carrying low-level ciprofloxacin resistance genes qnrA1, qnrB19 or qnrS1 (ciprofloxacin MIC range: 0.19-0.38 mg/L). Time-kill studies were performed for all four isogenic strains at the following concentrations: 1x, 2x, 4x, 8x and 16x MIC. Ciprofloxacin serum and urine pharmacokinetics was determined to calculate a murine dose equivalent (AUC(24)) to the standard human dose of 500 mg twice daily, which corresponded to 0.2 mg/mouse four times daily. In the murine UTI model, mice infected with each of the isogenic qnr strains or the wt strain were treated with ciprofloxacin (0.2 mg/mouse) or saline (only the E. coli wt) subcutaneously four times daily for 3 days starting 24 h after bacterial inoculation. RESULTS: In vitro, the strains responded to ciprofloxacin concentrations of 4-16x MIC by several log(10) reductions. In vivo, despite ciprofloxacin reaching urine concentrations far exceeding the MICs for the strains (500 mg/L), ciprofloxacin was significantly less efficient at reducing the urine and bladder bacterial counts of qnrA1-, qnrB19- and qnrS1-positive strains compared with the ciprofloxacin-treated wt strain (P < 0.05). None of the four strains infected the kidneys well, with median cfu counts of <1 log(10). CONCLUSIONS: Although qnr genes only confer low levels of resistance to ciprofloxacin, a reduced bactericidal activity of ciprofloxacin was observed in both urine and bladder in the murine model of UTI.
