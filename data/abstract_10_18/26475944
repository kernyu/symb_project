Funguria, and particularly candiduria, is an increasingly common problem encountered by the practicing urologist and is associated with high-acuity care, indwelling catheters, diabetes mellitus, antibiotic and steroid use, and urinary tract disease. In most cases, candiduria is asymptomatic and follows a benign clinical course with antifungal therapy only required in symptomatic or high-risk cases, because spontaneous resolution is common in patients with asymptomatic colonization. Rarely, invasive infections can occur (such as fungus balls or renal abscesses) and may require percutaneous and endoscopic interventions. This article highlights the workup and treatment of funguria and its related urologic manifestations.
