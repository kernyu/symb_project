In recent years in France, England, Wales, Denmark and the USA about 500 human infections occurred, which were caused by multidrug-resistant Salmonella enterica Serovar (S.) Kentucky isolates displaying high-level resistance to fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, MIC > or = 4 mg/l). The responsible clone was referred to as ST198-X1.To determine whether this clone is also present in German S. Kentucky isolates, the National Reference Laboratory for Salmonella (NRL-Salm) at the BfR analyzed the trend of S. Kentucky isolates received over the past years. Since 2010 the first entries of highly ciprofloxacin resistant S. Kentucky isolates, especially from turkey meat products, were recorded. 15 isolates originating from animal or food as well as one human isolate displayed MIC values of > or = 8 mg/l to ciprofloxacin. Molecular biological typing methods showed the in Germany isolated S. Kentucky isolates to be identical to the clone described by Le Hello et al. (2011) and to carry a multidrug resistance conferring region (SGI1). Since fluoroquinolones are considered by the WHO in human and veterinary medicine as drugs of critical importance, this trend demands attention. The implementation of mitigation strategies for this highly resistant clone seems to be required.
