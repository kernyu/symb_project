Erlotinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been shown to have benefits for non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer patients; however, almost all patients develop progressive disease during the therapy. On the other hand, it has been reported that a tumor continues to express epidermal growth factor receptor even after developing progressive disease. To demonstrate the clinical relevance of erlotinib treatment after progressive disease, we investigated whether continuous administration of erlotinib in combination with chemotherapy has a useful effect on progressive disease development during erlotinib treatment. For this purpose, we examined the antitumor effect of a combination therapy of a chemotherapeutic agent with erlotinib using two types of erlotinib-resistant tumor xenograft models: a non-small cell lung cancer model, in which EBC-1, H1975 and HCC827TR3 tumors were implanted, and an HPAC pancreatic cancer cell xenograft which generates erlotinib-resistant tumors in vivo. As a result, the combination therapy showed a significantly higher antitumor activity compared with chemomonotherapy in all xenograft models except the H1975 xenografts. Furthermore, erlotinib alone suppressed the phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor in HPAC tumors and the two non-small cell lung cancer cell lines other than H1975. Therefore, combination therapy which uses erlotinib can be considered effective if epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylation is inhibited by erlotinib, even in erlotinib-resistant tumor xenograft models. Our results suggest that the continuous inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylation by erlotinib after progressive disease enhances the antitumor activity of chemotherapy.
