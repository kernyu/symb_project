We investigated the genetic relatedness, antibiotic resistance and biofilm-producing ability of 114 strains of Salmonella, belonged to three serotypes (Corvallis, Brancaster and Albany), isolated from naturally contaminated poultry and their environment in wet markets and smale-scale processing plant from northern Malaysia. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed that Salmonella strains isolated from various wet markets were clonally related, suggesting the widespread dissemination of these three serotypes in northern Malaysia. All except one strain of Salmonella were resistant to more than two classes of antibiotics, hence regarded as multidrug resistant (MDR). Resistance to sulphonamide (96.5%), ampicillin (89.5%), tetracycline (85.1%), chloramphenicol (75.4%), trimethoprim (68.4%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (67.5%), streptomycin (58.8%) and nalidixic acid (44.4%) were observed. Resistance determinants, floR, cmlA, tetA, tetB, tetG, temB, blaPSE-1, sul1, sul2, qnrA, qnrS, strA and aadA were detected by PCR among MDR Salmonella strains. Seventy-six strains (66.7%) harboured class-I integrons. The gene cassettes identified were dfrA1, dfrA12, aadA2 and an open reading frame orfC with unknown function. All Salmonella strains produced biofilm and 69.3% of them were strong biofilm-producers. Our findings suggested that most likely, persistent Salmonella colonises various sites in the processing environment by producing biofilm, which leads to their widespread dissemination in wet markets located in northern Malaysia.
