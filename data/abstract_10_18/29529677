AIM: This study was carried out to record the sensitivity/resistance pattern of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae towards antimicrobial drugs prescribed to urinary tract infection (UTI) patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 68 bacteriologically proven simple UTI patients were included in the study, based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects demographics, antibiotics prescribed, sensitivity pattern of antibiotics towards the urinary pathogens were recorded in drug utilization and documentation form. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 29.32 years. The maximum number of patients fell under the age group 21-30 years. The maximum no of male and female patients belonged to the age group 21-30 years, 82.35% were females and 17.64% were males. E. coli found to be the most common uropathogens followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae. Nitrofurantoin was the most commonly prescribed drug followed by ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and amikacin. E. coli isolates showed high resistance for ampicillin followed by cotrimoxazole, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, tetracycline and ceftazidime and least resistance to amikacin, nitrofurantoin. Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were highly resistant against ceftazidime, ampicilline, cotrimoxazole, nitrofurantoin, gentamicin, amoxicillin + sulbactam. Overall, the antibiotic against with high resistance found was ampicillin followed by cotrimoxazole, gentamicin, ceftazidime, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, levofloxacin, cefepime and least resistance to amikacin, netilmicin and nitrofurantoin. CONCLUSION: Majority of UTIs in this study were caused by E. coli followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae. The high resistance was found with ampicillin (75%). Nitrofurantoin was the most commonly prescribed drug followed by other flouroquinolones.
