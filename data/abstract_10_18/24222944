Accumulating evidence has implicated Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection in extragastrointestinal diseases, including obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and liver disease. Recently, there has been a special focus on H. pylori infection as a risk factor for the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is currently considered to be the most common liver disorder in western countries, and is rapidly becoming a serious threat to public health. The mechanisms of pathogenesis underlying NAFLD remain unclear at present and therapeutic options are limited. The growing awareness of the role of H. pylori in NAFLD is thus important to aid the development of novel intervention and prevention strategies, because the eradication of H. pylori is easy and much less expensive than long-term treatment of the other risk factors. H. pylori infection is involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance (IR), which is closely linked with NAFLD. It provides a new insight into the pathogenesis of NAFLD. This review probes the possible relationship between H. pylori and NAFLD, from the perspective of the potential mechanism of how H. pylori infection brings about IR and other aspects concerning this correlation.
