Some beta-1,3-glucans and particularly sulfated laminarin (PS3) are known as resistance inducers (RIs) in grapevine against the downy mildew. However, their efficacy in vineyard is still often too low, which might be caused by a limited penetration through the leaf cuticle following spray application. We used (14) C-sucrose uptake experiments with grapevine leaves in order to select a surfactant as saccharide penetration enhancer. Our results showed that although sucrose foliar uptake was low, it was strongly enhanced by Dehscofix CO125 (DE), a highly ethoxylated surfactant. Fluorescent saccharides were then produced and laser scanning microscopy was used to analyze their foliar diffusion pattern in Arabidopsis thaliana and grapevine. Interestingly, sucrose and PS3 were seemingly able to penetrate the leaf cuticle only when formulated with DE. Diffusion could preferentially occur via stomata, anticlinal cell walls and trichomes. In grapevine, PS3 penetration rate was much higher on the stomateous abaxial surface of the leaf than on the adaxial surface. Finally, using DE allowed a higher level of downy mildew control by PS3, which corroborated diffusion observations. Our results have practical consequences for the improvement of treatments with saccharidic inducers on grape. That is, formulation of such RIs plays a critical role for their cuticular diffusion and consequently their efficacy. Also, spray application should preferentially target the abaxial surface of the leaves in order to maximize their penetration.
