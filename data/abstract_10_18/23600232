OBJECTIVE: To learn about the clinical distribution and drug resistance of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) isolated from inpatients and provide evidence for clinically reasonable use of antibiotics. METHODS: Data including clinical features and drug sensitivity of S. aureus isolated from hospitalized patients in the last two years were analyzed. RESULTS: 248 S. aureus strains were isolated from inpatients of our hospital in the last 2 years. The most common disease caused by S. aureus was pneumonia with a total of 163 patients. The second was skin and soft tissue infection with 21 patients in total. Sepsis occurred in 11 patients. The most commonly used antibiotics included oxacillin, nafcillin, cefathiamidine and vancomycin. The average course of antibiotic was 12.48 days. Treatment course of pneumonia and sepsis was 13.71 and 15.11 respectively. 96.31% (235/244) of S. aureus were resistant to penicillin. Vancomycin-resistant S. aureus has not been isolated. CONCLUSION: S. aureus pneumonia is the leading cause of hospitalization of children with S. aureus infection. S. aureus is highly resistant to commonly used antibiotics and related infections need longer therapy. Clinicians should pay more attention to S. aureus infection.
