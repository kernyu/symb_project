PURPOSE: Antituberculosis drug-induced liver injury (ATDILI) is one of the most deleterious side effects associated with chemotherapy against tuberculosis (TB). In this study, our objective was to determine the incidence, risk factors, and management of ATDILI and analyze its impact on the treatment outcome in patients receiving standard anti-TB chemotherapy. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of ATDILI prevalence was conducted in 938 enrolled patients of the 1426 TB cases in Shanghai from March 2011 to September 2012. Patients were followed up until February 2014. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine the risk factors of ATDILI. Successful therapeutic outcome, rates of drug resistance conversion, sputum smear/culture conversion, and lung cavity closure were analyzed. RESULTS: Hepatitis B surface antigen/hepatitis B e antigen-positive hepatitis B carriers, complicated with systemic lupus erythematosus, albumin </= 25 g/L, and chronic alcoholism were independent risk factors for ATDILI. Of the 121 cases with ATDILI (incidence rate of 12.9%), 84 (69.4%) used modified anti-TB therapy after recovery of liver function. Compared with the non-ATDILI group, patients with ATDILI exhibited remarkably decreased lung cavity closure rate (84.6% vs. 93.0%, P < 0.001) along with significantly reduced sputum smear/culture conversion rate (85.4% vs. 94.0%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that 12.9% patients developed ATDILI during standard anti-TB therapy, resulting in poor therapeutic outcome. Hepatitis B carriers with systemic lupus erythematosus, albumin </= 25 g/L, and chronic alcoholism manifested increased risks for ATDILI. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
