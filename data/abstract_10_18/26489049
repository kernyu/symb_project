Salmonella is commonly found in a variety of food products and is a major cause of bacterial foodborne illness throughout the world. In this study, we investigated the prevalence and diversity of Salmonella in eight different food types: sheep ground meat, cow ground meat, chicken meat, cow offal, traditional Sanliurfa cheese, unripened feta cheese, pistachios, and isot (a spice blend of dried red peppers specific to Sanliurfa), traditionally and commonly consumed in Turkey. Among 192 food samples, Salmonella was detected in 59 samples, with the highest prevalence in raw poultry parts (58%) and offal (58%) samples, while Salmonella was not detected in pistachios and dried red pepper. Resultant Salmonella isolates were characterized by serotyping, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Ten different serotypes represented 10 MLST sequence types (STs) with 1 novel ST and 17 PFGE types. Antimicrobial resistance profiling revealed that 30.5% of the isolates were resistant to two or more antimicrobials. Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serotype Telaviv, which is rare throughout the world, was the second most common serotype isolated from food samples in this study, suggesting that this serotype might be one of the subtypes that is endemic to Turkey.
