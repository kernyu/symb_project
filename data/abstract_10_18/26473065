BACKGROUND: Despite all advances in neurological sciences, there are unknown aspects in the epidemiology of multiple sclerosis (MS). Based on this hypothesis, the enterotoxigenic strains of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) are possible risk factors for exacerbations of MS. OBJECTIVES: The present study was carried out to investigate the role of resistant strains of enterotoxigenic S. aureus in MS exacerbation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two-hundred nasal swab samples were collected from non-MS (n = 80), MS stable (n = 60) and MS exacerbation (n = 60) groups. Samples were cultured and those that were S. aureus-positive were analyzed for the presence of enterotoxins, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Antimicrobial susceptibility was performed using disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Ninety out of 200 nasal samples (45%) were positive for S. aureus. The highest levels of nasal colonization were seen in MS exacerbation group (68.33%). The most commonly detected enterotoxins were sea (30%), sec (15.55%) and seb (11.11%). There were significant differences between S. aureus colonization and type of samples (P = 0.026) and, also, between type of samples and prevalence of enterotoxins (P = 0.022). The highest levels of enterotoxigenic genes were seen in MS exacerbation group. The S. aureus strains had the highest levels of resistance against tetracycline (80%), ampicillin (72.22%), methicillin (66.66%), erythromycin (66.66%), oxacillin (63.33%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (61.11%) and cotrimoxazole (55.55%). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings should raise awareness about the role of sea and sec enterotoxins, in resistant strains of S. aureus, as a risk factor for MS exacerbation. It is better to keep MS patients away from polluted environments of hospitals and health centers.
