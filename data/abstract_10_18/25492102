Iranian Tissue Bank established in 1994 provides soft tissues for implantation in Iran. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of decontamination process of cardiac and soft tissues in Iranian Tissue Bank. In this bank after initial assessments, the tissues were incubated in a 5-antibiotic cocktail at room temperature for 24 h and then at 4 degrees C for 14 days. Contamination status was compared before and after antibiotic cocktail incubation. Of 3,315 assessed tissues, 1,057 were pericardia, 1,051 were fascia and 1,207 were other soft tissues including tibialis and aorta. The initial contamination rate was 36.86%. Pericardia showed the highest contamination rate. Klebsiella species was the most prevalent organism causing contamination. Decontamination rate after antibiotic incubation was 86.91% with the highest successful decontamination rate for fascia tissue. Klebsiella species was the major source of contamination in tissues that remained contaminated after antibiotic incubation. This may be due to resistance of this organism to applied antibiotics in the decontamination cocktail possibly due to a negative drug interaction between aminoglycoside and penicillin derivatives in this antibiotic cocktail. In conclusion collected data shows comparable efficacy of the decontamination process that is used in ITB compared with homograft banks of other countries.
