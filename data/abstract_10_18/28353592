BACKGROUND: Several studies have reported that multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1) C3435T polymorphism was associated with the rate of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication in proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-based triple therapy. However, the conclusions were inconsistent. Therefore, this meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the impact of MDR1 C3435T polymorphism on H. pylori eradication by PPI-based triple therapy. METHODS: Seven eligible studies published up to August 2016 and including 1019 patients were identified by searching the Chinese Biomedical Literature database, Wan fang, PubMed, and the Web of Science electronic databases. Consequently, a meta-analysis was conducted with STATA software, using summary odds ratios (OR) and a 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Overall, there was no significant difference between MDR1 C3435T polymorphism and the eradication rate of H. pylori in the entire genetic model, irrespective of the PPI used. Furthermore, in Asian populations, the TT genotype decreased H. pylori eradication (TT vs CT+CC: OR=0.411, 95% CI = 0.280-0.602, P = 0.000). In addition, a significantly low eradication rate was observed in a recessive model, in which either lansoprazole (TT vs CT+CC: OR = 0.305, 95% CI = 0.184-0.504, P = 0.000) or omeprazole (TT vs CT+CC: OR = 0.229, 95% CI = 0.069-0.763, P = 0.016) was taken, in a subanalysis of individual PPIs. In the analyses that were stratified by disease type, no significant difference was observed in the peptic ulcer group and the combined diseases subgroup. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis indicated that the TT genotype of the MDR1 C3435T polymorphism decreased H. pylori eradication in Asian populations and was also associated with a low cure rate of H. pylori in patients taking lansoprazole- and omeprazole-based triple therapies. However, future studies using larger sample sizes are required.
