In the era of increasing antibiotic resistance, development of new agents that could provide therapeutic options for difficult to treat pathogens is vital. Dalbavancin is a new lipoglycopeptide recently approved by the US FDA for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections. A derivative of the older glycopeptide class, chemical structure alterations resulted in a molecule with a similar mechanism of action, however, with a comparatively increased activity as reflected by organism MICs. These modifications also resulted in an antibiotic with distinctive properties that allow for once-weekly dosing in the treatment of Gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and drug resistant Streptococcus spp. As the first of these long acting compounds, understanding the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of agents like dalbavancin is essential for determining a place in therapy.
