The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), mutation prevention concentrations (MPCs) and contribution of quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) mutations to fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin and orbifloxacin) susceptibility in 23 Pasteurella multocida (Pm) isolates were investigated. Fluoroquinolone-susceptible isolates (MICs </=0.25 microg/ml, 9 isolates) had no QRDR mutations, and their respective MPCs were low. Fluoroquinolone-intermediate isolates (MICs=0.5 microg/ml, 14 isolates) had QRDR mutations (Asp87 to Asn or Ala84 to Pro in gyrA), and their respective MPCs were high (4-32 microg/ml). First-step mutants (n=5) and laboratory-derived highly resistant fluoroquinolone mutants (n=5) also had QRDR mutations. The MICs of fluoroquinolones for mutant-derived strains were decreased in the presence of efflux inhibitors. The results indicated that the fluoroquinolone resistance of Pm is mainly due to multiple target gene mutations in gyrA and parC and the overexpression of efflux pump genes.
