Interferons (IFNs) are the first line of defense against viral infections in vertebrates. Type III interferon (IFN-lambda) is recognized for its key role in innate immunity of tissues of epithelial origin. Here we describe the identification of the Pekin duck IFN-lambda ortholog (duIFN-lambda). The predicted duIFN-lambda protein has an amino acid identity of 63%, 38%, 37% and 33% with chicken IFN-lambda and human IFN-lambda3, IFN-lambda2 and IFN-lambda1, respectively. The duck genome contains a single IFN-lambda gene that is comprised of five exons and four introns. Recombinant duIFN-lambda up-regulated OASL and Mx-1 mRNA in primary duck hepatocytes. Our observations suggest evolutionary conservation of genomic organization and structural features implicated in receptor binding and antiviral activity. The identification and expression of duIFN-lambda will facilitate further study of the role of type III IFN in antiviral defense and inflammatory responses of the Pekin duck, a non-mammalian vertebrate and pathogen host with relevance for human and animal health.
