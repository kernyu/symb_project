Antibacterial effects of the electromagnetic irradiation (EMI) of 51.8 and 53 GHz frequencies with low intensity (the flux capacity of 0.06 mW/cm(2)) and non-thermal action were investigated upon direct irradiation of E. coli K12. Significant decrease in bacterial growth rate and in the number of viable cells, marked change in H(+) and K(+) transport across membrane were shown. Subsequent addition of kanamycin or ceftriaxone (15 or 0.4 muM, respectively) enhanced the effects of irradiation. This was maximally achieved at the frequency of 53 GHz. These all might reveal membrane as probable target for antibacterial effects. Apparently, the action of EMI on bacteria might lead to changed membrane properties and to antibiotic resistance. The results should improve using extremely high frequency EMI in combination with antibiotics in biotechnology, therapeutic practice, and food industry.
