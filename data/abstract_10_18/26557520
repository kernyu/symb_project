INTRODUCTION: Surgical site infections (SSI) constitute a major public health problem worldwide and are the second most frequently reported nosocomial infections. They are responsible for increasing the treatment cost, length of hospital stay and significant morbidity and mortality. AIM: To determine the incidence of SSIs and the prevalence of aerobic bacterial pathogens involved with their antibiogram. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples were collected using sterile cotton swabs from 137 patients clinically diagnosed of having SSIs and were processed as per standard microbiological techniques. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done using modified Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. This cross sectional study was conducted for a period of six months (January 2013 to June 2013) in the Department of Microbiology at a rural tertiary care hospital of Uttarakhand state, India. RESULTS: Out of 768 patients, 137 (17.8%) were found to have SSIs and samples were collected from them. Out of total 137 samples, 132 (96.4%) yielded bacterial growth and 139 bacterial isolates were obtained. Staphylococcus aureus (50.4%) was the commonest organism followed by Escherichia coli (23.02%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.9%) and Citrobacter species (7.9%). Antimicrobial profile of gram positive isolates revealed maximum sensitivity to vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid, whereas among gram negative isolates meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, and amikacin were found to be most sensitive. CONCLUSION: The rate of SSI observed in this study was comparable to other similar studies, however we observed a higher degree of antimicrobial resistance. Adherence to strict infection control measures, maintenance of proper hand hygiene and optimal preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative patient care will surely reduce the incidence of SSIs.
