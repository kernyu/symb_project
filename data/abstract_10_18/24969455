OBJECTIVE: To study resistance evolution pathway of HIV-1 CRF_BC under drug selection pressure, and compare with B subtype. METHODS: Based on the reverse transcriptase region of CRF_ 97BC HIV-1 from 588 treatment-naive and 274 treatment patients, selection pressure based method was used to select resistance-associated mutations, and Bayesian network was used to construct the resistance evolutionary pathway under antiretroviral therapy. Meanwhile, it was constructed that the resistance evolutionary pathway for B subtype with the same regimens using the data from HIV resistance database, and made a comparison with CRF_07BC. RESULTS: The major resistance mutations for CRF_07BC were identified including K103N, Q197K, V179D and Y188L. While for B subtype, the major resistance mutations include M184V, K103N,Y181C, T69N,G190A, K238T,Y188H and P225H. Much difference was observed between these two classes. However, the classical TMA1 (41L, 210W and 215Y) and TMA2 (67N, 70R and 219E/Q) pathways exist in both pathways. As different from B subtype, the predicted major drug resistance mutations for CRF_07BC did not contain TAM-related mutations, and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-related mutations and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-related mutations were mutually depending on each other. CONCLUSION: HIV-1 CRF_07BC showed distinctive resistance evolutionary pathway, the mutations K103N,Q197K,V179D and Y188L were the major resistance mutations, and different resistance evolutionary pathways were observed between HIV-1 CRF_07BC and B subtype.
