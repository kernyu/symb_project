Despite continuous efforts to control cariogenic dental biofilms, very few effective antimicrobial treatments exist. In this study, we characterized the activity of the novel synthetic cyclic lipopeptide 4 (CLP-4), derived from fusaricidin, against the cariogenic pathogen Streptococcus mutans UA159. We determined CLP-4's MIC, minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), and spontaneous resistance frequency, and we performed time-kill assays. Additionally, we assessed CLP-4's potential to inhibit biofilm formation and eradicate preformed biofilms. Our results demonstrate that CLP-4 has strong antibacterial activity in vitro and is a potent bactericidal agent with low spontaneous resistance frequency. At a low concentration of 5 mug/ml, CLP-4 completely inhibited S. mutans UA159 biofilm formation, and at 50 mug/ml, it reduced the viability of established biofilms by >99.99%. We also assessed CLP-4's cytotoxicity and stability against proteolytic digestion. CLP-4 withstood trypsin or chymotrypsin digestion even after treatment for 24 h, and our toxicity studies showed that CLP-4 effective concentrations had negligible effects on hemolysis and the viability of human oral fibroblasts. In summary, our findings showed that CLP-4 is a potent antibacterial and antibiofilm agent with remarkable stability and low nonspecific cytotoxicity. Hence, CLP-4 is a promising novel antimicrobial peptide with potential for clinical application in the prevention and treatment of dental caries.
