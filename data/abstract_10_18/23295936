Antibiotic resistance is a growing public health crisis. To address the development of bacterial resistance, the use of antibiotics has to be minimized for nonsystemic applications in humans, as well as in animals and plants. Possible substitutes with low potential for developing resistance are active chlorine compounds that have been in clinical use for over 180 years. These agents are characterized by pronounced differences in their chlorinating and/or oxidizing activity, with hypochlorous acid (HOCl) as the strongest and organic chloramines as the weakest members. Bacterial killing in clinical practice is often associated with unwanted side effects such as chlorine consumption, tissue irritation, and pain, increasing proportionally with the chlorinating/oxidizing potency. Since the chloramines are able to effectively kill pathogens (bacteria, fungi, viruses, protozoa), their application as anti-infectives is advisable, all the more so as they exhibit additional beneficial properties such as destruction of toxins, degradation of biofilms, and anticoagulative and anti-inflammatory activities. Within the ample field of chloramines, the stable N-chloro derivatives of beta-aminosulfonic acids are most therapeutically advanced. Being available as sodium salts, they distinguish themselves by good solubility and absence of smell. Important representatives are N-chlorotaurine, a natural compound occurring in the human immune system, and novel mono- and dichloro derivatives of dimethyltaurine, which feature improved stability.
