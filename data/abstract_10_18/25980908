Series of 4-(5-aryl-2H-tetrazol-2-yl)butan-2-ol, 1-(5-aryl-2H-tetrazol-2-yl)propan-2-ol and their acetates have been screened against Candida albicans. Among the tested compounds, (+/-)-1-[5-(2-chlorophenyl)-2H-tetrazol-2-yl]propan-2-yl acetate (E5) proved to be the most effective inhibitor of fungal growth and was further evaluated against young (adhesion phase) and mature biofilm in vitro. The activity exhibited by the tested tetrazole derivatives against C. albicans associated with minor cytotoxicity towards Vero epithelial cells make us suggest that E5 could be a promising structure in the development of new antifungals. Serine protease Kex2 appeared essential for the resistance mechanism. Further investigations of in vivo activity, drug interactions, and E5 structure optimization are needed.
