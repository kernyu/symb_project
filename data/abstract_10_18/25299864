We linked results from the Fourth Botswana National Drug Resistance Survey (DRS), 2007-2008, to patient records from the national Electronic Tuberculosis Registry to determine treatment outcomes. Of 915 new patients, 651 (71%) had treatment data available. Completion or cure was achieved for 10/15 (67%, 95%CI 42-85) with isoniazid monoresistance, (6/16, 38%, 95%CI 18-61) with multidrug resistance, while 73% (391/537, 95%CI 69-76) were susceptible to first-line drugs. The analysis was limited because of unavailable treatment records and undocumented outcomes. Prospective analyses following DRSs should be considered to ensure adequate outcome data.
