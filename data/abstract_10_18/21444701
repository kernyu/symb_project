In this study, the first such study in Greece, we used polyphasic identification combined with antifungal susceptibility study to analyze Aspergillus clinical isolates comprising 102 common and rare members of sections Fumigati, Flavi, Terrei, Nidulantes, Nigri, Circumdati, Versicolores, and Usti. High amphotericin B MICs (>2 mug/ml) were found for 17.6% of strains. Itraconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole MICs of >4 mug/ml were shown in 1%, 5%, and 0% of the isolates, respectively. Anidulafungin, micafungin, and caspofungin minimum effective concentrations (MECs) of >/=2 mug/ml were correspondingly recorded for 4%, 9%, and 33%, respectively, of the strains.
