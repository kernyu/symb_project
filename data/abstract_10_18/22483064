Rhodiola rosea is a commonly used folk medicine for the treatment of high altitude sickness, mountain malhypoxia, and anoxia. Its active ingredient, salidroside [2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl beta-D-glucopyranoside (1)], has been reported to have a broad spectrum of biological effects. However, the protective role of 1 in human erythrocytes remains unclear. This study therefore has investigated the effects of 1 on oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in human erythrocytes (also known as eryptosis or erythroptosis). Compound 1 increased cell survival significantly and prevented human erythrocytes from undergoing eryptosis/erythroptosis mediated by H(2)O(2), as confirmed by the decreased expression of phosphatidylserine on the cell surface and reduced leakage of calcein through the damaged membrane. Mechanistically, 1 was found to exert its protective effects through its antioxidative activity and the inhibition of caspase-3 activation and stress-induced intracellular Ca(2+) rise in a dose-dependent manner. Compound 1 is a protective agent in human erythrocytes against oxidative stress and may be a good adaptogen to enhance the body's resistance to stress and fatigue.
