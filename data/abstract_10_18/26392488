A total of 421 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clinical isolates were tested for ceftaroline susceptibility by Etest (bioMerieux). A multidrug resistant phenotype was found in 40.9%, and clonal complex 239 (CC239) was found in 33.5%. Ceftaroline nonsusceptibility (MIC, >1.0 mug/ml) was 16.9% overall. Nonsusceptibility was significantly higher in CC239 (41.1%, 58/141) and in isolates with a multidrug resistant phenotype (35.5%, 61/172) compared with comparators (P < 0.0001). Nonsusceptibility of common multidrug resistant MRSA clones limits the empirical use of ceftaroline for these infections.
