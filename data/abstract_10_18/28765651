Agonist interaction with Toll-like receptors (TLRs) induces T cell-mediated immunity, which is effective against intracellular pathogens. Consequently, TLR agonists are being tried as immunomodulatory agents. The lectin ArtinM targets TLR2 N-glycans on macrophages, induces cytokines production, and promotes T helper-1 immunity, a process that culminates in resistance to several parasitic and fungal infections in vivo. Because co-receptors influence agonist binding to TLRs, we investigated whether CD14 is required for macrophage activation induced by ArtinM. Macrophages from wild-type mice stimulated by ArtinM not only produced cytokines but also had the following activation profile: (i) expression of M1 polarization markers; (ii) nitrite oxide production; (iii) cellular migration; (iv) enhanced phagocytic and fungicide activity; (v) modulation of TLR2 expression; and (vi) activation of NF-kappaB pathway. This activation profile induced by ArtinM was evaluated in macrophages lacking CD14 that showed none of the ArtinM effects. We demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and sugar inhibition assays the physical interaction of ArtinM, TLR2, and CD14, which depends on recognition of the trimannoside that constitutes the core of N-glycans. Thus, our study showed that CD14 is critical for ArtinM-induced macrophage activation, providing fundamental insight into the design of anti-infective therapies based on carbohydrate recognition.
