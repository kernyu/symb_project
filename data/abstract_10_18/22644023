LFF571 is a novel semisynthetic thiopeptide and potent inhibitor of Gram-positive bacteria. We report that the antibacterial activity of LFF571 against Clostridium difficile is due to inhibition of translation. Single-step mutants of C. difficile with reduced susceptibility to LFF571 were selected at frequencies of <4.5 x 10(-11) to 1.2 x 10(-9). Sequencing revealed a G260E substitution in the thiopeptide-binding pocket of elongation factor Tu. Importantly, this mutation did not confer cross-resistance to clinically used antimicrobials. These results support the development of LFF571 as a treatment for C. difficile infection.
