An outbreak of intravascular catheter-related infections by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli in calves in an animal teaching hospital is reported. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used for strain typing to determine the origin and dissemination of these strains. All 19 strains harboured the blaCTX-M-14, and six strains also overexpressed their chromosomal AmpC gene. Evidence on the introduction of the strain from a beef herd, experiencing neonatal diarrhoea and increased mortality, to the clinic through admission of diarrhoeic calves was provided. Strains isolated from phlebitis cases from other herds up to 5 months later showed a high similarity with the initial strain, suggesting that the strain had become nosocomial. The catheter infections with ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli resulted in a prolonged hospitalization, increased anti-microbial use and mortality. This report points towards the potential dangers of the emergence of ESBL/AmpC-producing bacteria in susceptible food animals and warns farmers and veterinarians for the facility by which they are introduced into another environment.
