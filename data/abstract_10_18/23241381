An outbreak of multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRPA) infections in a university hospital is described. Phenotypic and genotypic analysis of 240 isolates revealed that 152 patients, mainly in the intensive care unit (ICU), were colonized or infected with MDRPA, the majority with O11. All metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-positive isolates carried the bla(VIM-2) or bla(VIM-1) gene. One or more type III secretion system toxin genes were detected in most isolates. Five dominant pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) types were characterized, associated with ST235, ST111, ST253, ST309, and ST639.
