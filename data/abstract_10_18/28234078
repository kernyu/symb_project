SETTING: In 2012, Peru's National TB Program (NTP) reported approximately 2400 incident cases of tuberculosis (TB) disease in children aged <15 years. Peru's TB burden is concentrated in the Lima metropolitan area, particularly in poor districts such as El Agustino and La Victoria, where this study was conducted. OBJECTIVE: To identify barriers to the treatment of childhood tuberculous infection and TB disease in Lima from the perspective of front-line providers and patients' families. DESIGN: We conducted 10 semi-structured focus groups with 53 purposefully sampled primary care providers, community health workers, and parents/guardians of pediatric TB patients. We also completed nine in-depth interviews with National TB Program administrators and pulmonologists specializing in TB. Two authors performed inductive thematic analysis and identified emerging themes. RESULTS: Four main treatment barriers emerged from the data: 1) dosing errors, 2) time- and labor-intensive preparation and administration of medications, 3) provider concern that isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) generates isoniazid resistance, and 4) poor adherence to IPT. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the urgent need for child-friendly formulations, provider and parent/guardian education about IPT, and strategies to promote adherence to IPT, including support and supervision by health workers and/or regimens with fewer doses.
