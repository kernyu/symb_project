BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance is an emerging phenomenon in kidney transplantation (KT). METHODS: We compared species distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in 1052 isolates from urine cultures obtained in 2 different cohorts of kidney transplant recipients in a single center (Cohort A: 189 patients undergoing KT between January 2002 and December 2004 [336 isolates]; Cohort B: 115 patients undergoing KT between January 2011 and December 2013 [716 isolates]). RESULTS: Asymptomatic bacteriuria accounted for most of the isolates (86.9% in Cohort A and 92.3% in Cohort B). Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.5% vs. 15.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.8% vs. 7.9%), and Enterobacter cloacae (0.6% vs. 3.1%) were significantly more common in Cohort B. The isolation of K. pneumoniae in Cohort B was associated with the occurrence of acute pyelonephritis (9.8% of all K. pneumoniae isolates vs. 2.8% of the remaining uropathogens; P = 0.001). Non-susceptibility rates among Enterobacteriaceae in Cohort B were higher for every class of antibiotics (P </= 0.003) with the exception of fosfomycin. Compared to Cohort A, significant increases were seen in isolates from Cohort B for multidrug-resistant (MDR) (43.9% vs. 67.8%, respectively; P = 0.001), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing (6.6% vs. 26.1%; P = 0.001), and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae strains (0.0% vs. 5.0%; P = 0.001). Such differences were mostly attributable to K. pneumoniae (as 54.5% and 13.4% of isolates in Cohort B were ESBL-producing and carbapenemase-producing, respectively). MDR isolates were responsible for 69.1% of episodes of symptomatic urinary tract infection in Cohort B. CONCLUSION: The increase in resistance rates among Enterobacteriaceae uropathogens is significant and may have an effect on KT programs.
