Colistin is a venerable antibiotic whose fortunes have been revived by its excellent activity, the diminishing output of novel clinically effective antibiotics and the increasing importance of MDR infection in burn surgery, both in the civilian and military arenas. This review synthesizes current evidence on the usage of colistin in burn surgery including the structure-activity relationship; dosing, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD), analytic methods, resistance and current research efforts into the redevelopment of this antibiotic, to distil recommendations for future research and clinical efficacy.
