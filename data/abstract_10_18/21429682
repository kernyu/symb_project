UNLABELLED: The aim of this study was to investigate the nasal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) and Haemophilus influenzae (HI) in children. METHODS: Nasal samples were swabbed from children 3 months to 3 years of age, between December 2006 and April 2007, in 10 day-care centers in Dijon. RESULTS: Three hundred and eighty-five children, 22.7 +/- 8.4 months, were included. All were vaccinated against H1 and 92% had received at least one dose of PCV7 vaccine. HI colonization (55%) was associated with young age and concomitant pneumococcal carriage (52.4% vs. 39%). Amoxicillin/clavulanate and cefotaxime resistance rates were 17% and 0.5%. Pneumococcal carriage (48%) was increased in case of prior hospitalization. The rate of PDSP, 50%, was increased in case of recent infection (91% vs. 81%), previous antibiotherapy (64% vs. 41%), and decreased if PCV7 was completed (40.2% vs. 61,8%). There was no resistance to amoxicillin. The erythromycin resistance rate was 50.5%. 15% of the strains were vaccinal serotypes. Thirty-six and 41% of the strains were related and non-related to vaccine serotypes. Twenty-four and 11.6% of the strains were serotypes 19A and 6A respectively. CONCLUSION: Over the last 10 years the global antibiotic resistance in children decreased for SP (22.9%) but nasal colonization remained stable due to the increase of some serotypes, such as 19A, most often resistant to antibiotics. The vaccine effectiveness against HI is optimal since no HIb serotypes were detected; resistance to betalactam is currently due equally to enzymatic mechanism and alteration of protein binding penicillin.
