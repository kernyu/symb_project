In yeasts, the PDR16 gene encodes a phosphatidylinositol transfer protein which belongs to the Sec14 homologue (SFH) family and localizes to lipid droplets, microsomes and at the cell periphery. The loss of its function alters the lipid droplet metabolism and plasma membrane properties, and renders yeast cells more sensitive to azole antimycotics. In this study, the entire chromosomal CgPDR16 ORF was replaced by the ScURA3 gene both in azole sensitive and azole resistant strains of Candida glabrata bearing a gain-of-function mutation in the CgPDR1 gene, and their responses to different stresses were assessed. The CgPDR16 deletion was found to sensitize the mutant strains to azole antifungals without changes in their osmo- and halotolerance. Fluconazole treated pdr16Delta mutant strains displayed a reduced expression of several genes involved in azole tolerance. The gain-of-function CgPDR1 allele as well as the cycloheximide and hydrogen peroxide treatments of cells enhanced the expression of the CgPDR16 gene. The results indicate that CgPDR16 belongs to genes whose expression is induced by chemical and oxidative stresses. The loss of its function can attenuate the expression of drug efflux pump encoding genes that might also contribute to the decreased azole tolerance in pdr16Delta mutant cells.
