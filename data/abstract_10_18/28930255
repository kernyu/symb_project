Antimicrobial resistance is a major global health issue that has the potential to reverse the substantial progress made against infectious diseases over the past several decades. We need strategic measures to deal with this challenge, including an intensification of public funding for research into anti-microbial agents and their alternatives, stricter mechanisms to minimize antimicrobial misuse within both clinical and non-clinical settings, and support for the development of country-level initiatives. Only with sustained, concerted, and coordinated global efforts are we likely to overcome the current and future challenges posed by these emerging "superbugs".
