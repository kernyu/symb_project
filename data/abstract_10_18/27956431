Infections caused by multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRPA) present a major problem for therapeutic management. We report here our experience with 12 patients with a severe MDRPA infection (6 of which were pneumonia) who received salvage therapy with ceftolozane-tazobactam after inappropriate empirical treatment and/or suboptimal targeted treatment. Although 10 of the 12 patients (83.3%) experienced septic shock, only 3 patients (25%) died during the follow-up period. Microbiological cure in 7 patients (58.3%) was observed.
