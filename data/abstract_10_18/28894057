A 68-year-old woman underwent replacement of the ascending aorta for acute type A aortic dissection. She was then diagnosed with postoperative methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection, and the infected aortic graft was replaced with a rifampicin-soaked vascular prosthesis, which was followed by continuous irrigation using a 0.1% povidone-iodine solution. The postoperative course was uneventful, and she has been doing well for 5 years with no recurrence of infection. Prosthetic graft replacement using a rifampicin-soaked graft followed by continuous irrigation with povidone-iodine is useful for treatment of an MRSA-infected prosthetic vascular graft.
