The German STI guidelines for gonococcal and chlamydial infections were recently updated. Representing the German Society of Urology (DGU) in these guidelines consensus processes, the authors summarize the recommendations regarding screening, appropriate laboratory diagnostics and dose-increased dual antimicrobial therapy of urethritis caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. Urologists need to be informed about an approaching era of untreatable gonorrhea. Although of limited use, whenever possible Neisseria gonorrhoeae cultures are required to monitor developing resistance to current treatment regimes. Recommendations for the use of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for detection of chlamydia and gonorrhea as the standard laboratory test remain. Because the majority of persons infected by Chlamydia trachomatis are not aware of the infection, untreated infection can lead to serious complications later on with the burden of disease and infertility sequelae considered to be a predominantly female problem. Principally, both partners should be treated simultaneously in order to prevent re-infection. Furthermore, therapy control is recommended for every gonorrhea.
