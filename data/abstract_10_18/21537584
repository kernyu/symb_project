This study evaluated the fracture resistance of teeth submitted to internal bleaching and restored with different procedures. Forty maxillary incisors were endodontically treated and assigned to 4 groups (n=10): G1- restored with composite resin (CR), G2- bleached with hydrogen peroxide (HP) and restored with CR, G3- restored with CR and fiberglass posts (CR + posts) and G4- bleached and restored with CR + posts. HP was applied in the buccal surface and pulp chamber 3 times at each one of 2 sessions with an interval of 7 days between them. Additional 10 sound incisors were subjected to fracture strength test (gold standard). The fracture strength (kN) was determined in an Instron machine. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer test (alpha=0.05). The untreated teeth (gold standard) showed the highest (p.
