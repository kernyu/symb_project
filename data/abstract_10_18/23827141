The intestinal opportunistic pathogen Bacteroides fragilis is among the most aerotolerant species of strict anaerobic bacteria and survives exposure to atmospheric oxygen for up to 72h. Under these circumstances, a strong oxygen stress response (OSR) mechanism is activated and the expression of as much as 45% of B. fragilis genes is altered. One of the most important regulators of this response is the product of the oxyR gene, but other regulation systems are in place during the OSR. The MarR family of transcriptional regulators has been shown to control several physiological events in bacteria, including response to stress conditions. In B. fragilis, at least three homologs of MarR regulators are present, one of which, bmoR, is upregulated during oxidative stress independently of oxyR. In this study, we demonstrate that the inactivation of the bmoR gene in B. fragilis diminishes its ability to withstand oxidative stress caused either by exposure to atmospheric oxygen or hydrogen peroxide. Recovery of growth rate on pre-oxidized media under anaerobiosis is slower than that observed in parental strain. Addition of hydrogen peroxide has a similar effect on the growth rate. Complementation of the mutant strain partially recovered the oxygen resistance phenotype, but the overexpression of the gene in the parental strain was also deleterious to a lesser extent. Our results indicate that BmoR has a role in the OSR in B. fragilis, particularly in the initial stages of oxygen exposure.
