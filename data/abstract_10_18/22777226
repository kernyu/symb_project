The pathophysiology of papulopustular rosacea (PPR) is primarily characterized by inflammation associated with several factors such as abnormal innate immune response, neurovascular dysregulation, stratum corneum barrier dysfunction, and depletion of antioxidant reserve, with no definitive evidence supporting an underlying microbial etiology. Several molecular inflammatory pathways have now been identified that enable the development of therapeutic agents that target the signs and symptoms of disease by modifying specific pathophysiological mechanisms. Available evidence demonstrates that topical and oral agents commonly used to treat PPR appear to modify some of these pathophysiological mechanisms and may prove to be complimentary when used in combination potentially leading to better therapeutic outcomes. During the past two decades, six clinical studies have been published on the benefits of combining oral and topical therapies for PPR. Four studies suggest that doxycycline, including anti-inflammatory dose doxycycline (doxycycline 40 mg modified-release capsule once daily) can be combined with topical metronidazole or azelaic acid in patients with PPR to achieve more rapid control of a flare. At present, subantimicrobial dosing of a tetracycline agent that also maintains anti-inflammatory activity has only been established with doxycycline. Although antibiotic doses of tetracycline agents (such as doxycycline, minocycline, and tetracycline) are known to be effective for PPR, the use of subantimicrobial dosing of doxycycline avoids the risk of antibiotic resistance.
