Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers, gastric cancer and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. The limitations of current therapies for H. pylori infection include poor compliance and antibiotic resistance. Therefore, an effective anti-H. pylori vaccine would be an alternative or complement to antibiotic treatment. Urease B (UreB) is considered an ideal vaccine antigen against H. pylori infection. In this study, cholera toxin B subunit (CTB), a mucosal adjuvant, was used to enhance the immunogenicity of a novel Bacillus subtilis spore vaccine expressing CTB-UreB, along with the B. subtilis spore coat protein CotC as a fusion protein. Oral administration of B. subtilis spores expressing CotC-UreB or CotC-CTB-UreB led to increased levels of UreB-specific IgG in serum and UreB-specific IgA in faeces, as well as elevated levels of IL-10 and IFN-gamma in splenocytes. In addition, oral administration of CotC-UreB or CotC-CTB-UreB spores induced significant reductions (80.0 and 90.5 %, respectively) in gastric H. pylori bacterial load (1.11+/-0.36x105 and 0.53+/-0.21x105 c.f.u., respectively) compared to that of the CotC control group (5.56+/-1.64x105 c.f.u., P<0.01). Moreover, CotC-CTB-UreB spores were significantly more effective at reducing the bacterial load than CotC-UreB spores (P<0.05). These results indicate that CotC-CTB-UreB-expressing B. subtilis spores are a potential vaccine candidate for the control of H. pylori infection.
