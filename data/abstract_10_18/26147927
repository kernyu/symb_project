Novel antimicrobials that effectively inhibit bacterial growth are essential to fight the growing threat of antibiotic resistance. A promising target is the bacterial ribosome, a 2.5 MDa organelle susceptible to several biorthogonal modes of action used by different classes of antibiotics. To promote the discovery of unique inhibitors, we have miniaturized a coupled transcription/translation assay using E. coli and applied it to screen a natural product library of ~30 000 extracts. We significantly reduced the scale of the assay to 2 muL in a 1536-well plate format and decreased the effective concentration of costly reagents. The improved assay returned 1327 hits (4.6% hit rate) with %CV and Z' values of 8.5% and 0.74, respectively. This assay represents a significant advance in molecular screening, both in miniaturization and its application to a natural product extract library, and we intend to apply it to a broad array of pathogenic microbes in the search for novel anti-infective agents.
