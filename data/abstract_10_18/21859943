Drug resistance surveillance identified six untreated leprosy patients in the Philippines with Mycobacterium leprae folP1 mutations which confer dapsone resistance. Five patients share a village of residence; four who carried the mutation, Thr53Val, were also linked by M. leprae variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) strain types. In India, folP1 mutations were detected in two relapse patients with a history of dapsone treatment. Mutations were not found in the rifampin target gene rpoB. These findings indicate that dapsone resistance is being transmitted.
