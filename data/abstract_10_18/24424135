A series of 1H-1,2,3-triazole-tethered isatin-7-chloroquinoline and 3-hydroxy-indole-7-chloroquinoline conjugates have been synthesized and evaluated for their antimalarial activity against chloroquine-resistant W2 strain of Plasmodium falciparum. The most potent of the test compound with an optimum combination of 3-hydroxy-indole ring and a n-butyl linker displayed an IC50 value of 69 nM.
