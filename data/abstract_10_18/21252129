QUESTION: With the influenza season reaching a peak, I see numerous children in my clinic with fever and influenza-like illnesses. Parents are concerned and at times ask for antibiotic treatment in hopes that the treatment will shorten the duration of illness. What strategies can I use in order to minimize inappropriate prescription of antibiotics during the influenza season? ANSWER: Use of antibiotics for treatment of viral infections such as influenza contributes to the emergence of resistant bacteria strains. Misuse and overuse of antibiotics can be reduced by preventing the infection and its complications through vaccination, point-of-care rapid influenza testing, and early antiviral treatment when appropriate, as well as constantly increasing the knowledge of both physicians and families regarding the appropriate use of antibiotics.
