This study aimed to characterize CTX-M producers of urinary E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates and to determine the prevalence of plasmid-mediated antimicrobial resistance genes among them. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined, and PCR and sequencing were performed. Among the 42 (82.3%) E. coli and 24 (77.4%) K. pneumoniae isolates containing bla(CTX-M), bla(CTX-M-14) and bla(CTX-M-15) were detected in 23 and 19 E. coli isolates, respectively, and in 7 and 17 K. pneumoniae isolates, respectively. CTX-M producers of urinary E. coli and K. pneumoniae were resistant to multiple antibiotics and contained other antimicrobial resistance genes. CTX-M-15 producers contained more antimicrobial resistance genes than did CTX-M-14 producers.
