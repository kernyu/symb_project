AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the proportion of common clarithromycin-resistant mutation types present in the 23S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene of H. pylori strains in Sri Lanka. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: The study was a cross-sectional, descriptive study where 76 dyspeptic patients who were required to undergo endoscopy examination were included. The study was carried out at a Teaching Hospital in Sri Lanka. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In-house urease test and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the glmM gene of H. pylori was performed to confirm the H. pylori infection. Analysis of point mutations in 23S rRNA gene strains were performed by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). RESULTS: Of the 16 urease-positive biopsies, 94% (n=15) were positive by PCR using the glmM primer. All H. pylori strains yeilded a point mutation at A2142G site of the 23S rRNA gene, while A2143G mutation was not detected. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time in Sri Lanka, we reported predominance of A2142G point mutation associated with claritromycin resistance of H. pylori in a Sri Lankan population.
