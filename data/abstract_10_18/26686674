PURPOSE: Post-operative surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most significant complications after instrumented spinal surgery. However, implant retention feasibility for early-onset multidrug-resistant SSI is still controversial. We aimed to verify our therapeutic strategy, surgical debridement with implant retention and long-term antimicrobial therapy for post-operative early-onset multidrug-resistant SSI. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical course of 11 cases [eight men and three women, with a mean age of 70.4 (54-82) years] with early-onset multidrug-resistant SSI out of 409 consecutive cases of spinal instrumentation surgery performed between 2007 and 2013 at our institution. RESULTS: The median duration of follow-up was 868 (178-1,922) days. All SSIs were controlled, without recurrence during follow-up. The microbial pathogens were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (seven cases), multidrug-resistant Corynebacterium (two cases), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (one case), and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus (one case). The mean duration from SSI diagnosis to surgery was 2.9 (1-6) days. Ten patients underwent surgical debridement with implant retention. No patients required multiple operations. All patients were given antimicrobial treatments. Mean duration of intravenous antimicrobials (vancomycin, vancomycin+ piperacillin/tazobactam, or gentamicin) was 66.5 (12-352) days and 336 (89-1,673) days for oral antimicrobials (rifampicin + sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, or minomycin). The mean duration of clinical signs and symptom recovery was 31.0 (7-73) days, and the mean time for normalization of C-reactive protein was 54.5 (7-105) days. CONCLUSIONS: Early-onset multidrug-resistant SSI was successfully treated by surgical debridement with implant retention and long-term antimicrobial therapy.
