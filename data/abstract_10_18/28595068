The control of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) seems to have come to an impasse. The use and abuse of antibacterial drugs has had major consequences on the genetic mutability of both pathogenic and nonpathogenic microorganisms, leading to the development of new highly resistant strains. Because of the complexity of this situation, an in silico strategy based on QSAR molecular topology was devised to identify synthetic molecules as antimicrobial agents not susceptible to one or several mechanisms of resistance such as: biofilms formation (BF), ionophore (IA) activity, epimerase (EI) activity or SOS system (RecA inhibition). After selecting a group of 19 compounds, five of them showed significant antimicrobial activity against several strains of Staphylococcus (2 S. aureus, including 1 methicillin resistant, and 1 S. epidermidis), with MIC values between 16 and 32 mg/L. Among the compounds active on RecA, one showed a marked activity in decreasing RecA gene expression in Escherichia coli.
