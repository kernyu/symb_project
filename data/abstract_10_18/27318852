The naturally high minimum inhibitory concentration exhibited by echinocandins against Candida parapsilosis has been known since the first introduction of these antifungal agents. Despite this awareness, clinical failures have not been reported; consequently, the resistance of C. parapsilosis to echinocandins remains unexplored. We exposed 30 isolates of C. parapsilosis to echinocandins (caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin) in vitro and studied the effects of this exposure. After 60 exposures, 80, 67, and 60 % of the isolates changed from susceptible to non-susceptible to caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin, respectively. In addition, four strains exhibited cross-resistance to all three echinocandins. Based on the M27-A3 (CLSI, 2008) and M27-S4 (CLSI, 2012) techniques, the susceptibility of the resistant strains to other antifungal agents was assayed. All of the tested echinocandin-resistant strains were susceptible to amphotericin B, and the resistance rate to fluconazole, voriconazole, and flucytosine was 73.3, 43.3, and 20 %, respectively. The exposure of C. parapsilosis to the three echinocandins generated cross-resistant strains and an unexpected in vitro resistance to azoles and flucytosine.
