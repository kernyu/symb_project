BACKGROUND: Multidrug resistance in Salmonella enteritidis isolates is a public health problem worldwide; the present study, therefore, was designed for antimicrobial-resistance determination in this strain. METHODS: Salmonella strains isolated from poultry samples by biochemical positive and negative tests were subjected to PCR and identified as Salmonella enteritidis. For detection and identification of Salmonella enteritidis isolates, sdfI gene-specific primers were used. RESULTS: We found that 100% of isolates were resistant to ampicillin, 90% were resistant to cephalothin and streptomycin, 70% were resistant to cefotaxime, and 60% were resistant to kanamycin and gentamicin. CONCLUSION: Salmonella enteritidis isolates had antimicrobial resistance to mentioned antibiotics.
