Antibiotic prescription for acute diarrhea is not devoid of risks. There are individual risks for the patient, such as allergy, gastrointestinal side effects, Clostridium difficile infection. There is also a risk of selection of antibiotic resistance in the digestive microbiota, leading to the emergence of multiresistant isolates such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase or carbapenemase producing Enterobacteriaceae, which are able to disseminate worldwide. Antibiotic prescriptions may thus be limited to patients with entero-invasive or severe choleriform diarrhea.
