Five blaOXA-48-like-carrying Enterobacteriaceae isolates collected from two Thai patients in December 2012 were characterized. Three Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates giving two different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns and sequence types (ST11 and ST37) from patient 1 harbored blaOXA-48 locating on Tn1999.2, whereas two Escherichia coli isolates with the same pulsotype and ST5 from Patient 2 carried ISEcp1-associated blaOXA-181. One K. pneumoniae strain had blaSHV-12, blaDHA-1, qnrB, and qnrS, while another strain harbored blaCTX-M-15, qnrS and aac(6')-Ib-cr. The E. coli strain contained blaCTX-M-15, blaCMY-2, qnrS, and aac(6')-Ib-cr. Interestingly, the OXA-48 producers with a novel OmpK36 variant by a substitution of Gly to Asp in the L3 loop-borne PEFXG motif exhibited high-level resistance to ertapenem, imipenem, and meropenem. In contrast, the OXA-181 producer with non-porin-deficient background showed low-level resistance to ertapenem only. Both patients died because of either septic shock or pneumonia. This study showed the impact of OXA-48-like carbapenemases in porin-defective clinical isolate background, which may lead to serious therapeutic problems in the near future.
