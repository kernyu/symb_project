We report a case in which an antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive patient diagnosed with HIV-1 subtype B presented with baseline genotype and phenotype resistance tests, confirming a V106V/I/M nucleoside resistance mutation. The V106V/I/M mutation represents a mixture of virus strains conferring resistance to the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor antiretrovirals efavirenz and nevirapine. V106M mutation is not often observed as a primary resistance mutation in patients infected with HIV-1 subtype B. The patient responded well to an ART regimen consisting of tenofovir-emtricitabine and raltegravir, achieving and maintaining an undetectable HIV RNA.
