OBJECTIVES: Few studies have examined Escherichia coli antimicrobial resistance across age groups over time. The objective of this study was to compare urinary E. coli antimicrobial resistance trends among adult and geriatric outpatients from 2000 to 2010. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility results for E. coli urine isolates from adult (aged 16-64 years) and geriatric (aged >/=65 years) outpatients were analysed using data from The Surveillance Network Database-USA. RESULTS: Susceptibility test results from adult (n = 6 412 025) and geriatric (n = 3 395 297) outpatients showed that E. coli antimicrobial resistance increased faster among geriatric outpatients for all agents studied. The greatest increases in resistance over the study time period were for ciprofloxacin (9.4% and 23.5% increases among adult and geriatric individuals, respectively), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (4.3% and 10.5%) and ampicillin (2.0% and 13.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Urinary E. coli antimicrobial resistance increased faster among geriatric outpatients than adult outpatients in the USA. Rising antimicrobial resistance disproportionately affects geriatric populations and presents a threat to public health.
