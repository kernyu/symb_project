The tet(X) gene encodes a flavin-dependent monooxygenase that confers resistance to all clinically relevant tetracycline antibiotics including tigecycline. It has only previously been identified in environmental and non-human pathogenic bacteria. To investigate levels of multidrug resistance in Bo, Sierra Leone, a molecular epidemiological study was conducted using an antimicrobial resistance determinant microarray (ARDM), PCR and DNA sequencing. The study found that 21% of isolates from Mercy Hospital (Bo, Sierra Leone) were tet(X)-positive, all of which originated from urinary specimens. Use of molecular epidemiological surveillance tools has provided the first evidence of tet(X)-containing multidrug-resistant Gram-negative hospital isolates in a hospital in Sierra Leone.
