Infections caused by Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) have emerged as a knotty clinical problem in the burn wards due to its omni-resistance to antibiotics and high prevalence. Although our knowledge in regard to the pathogenesis and the resistance mechanisms of AB is increasing, the available treatment remains much limited. Measures to effectively control nosocomial infection are warranted. Meanwhile, development of novel therapeutic agents or combination of antibiotics should be considered.
