Twenty-nine Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, which are resistant to carbapenems but susceptible to ceftazidime or/and cefepime, were recovered from our hospital from July 2011 to October 2011. The results of Western blotting showed that the OprD was reduced or lost. None of the 29 clinical isolates produced carbapenemases, extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, or Ambler class C beta-lactamases enzymes by the modified 3-dimensional test. The sequencing of oprD for these isolates showed that there are multiple point mutations, large fragment substitutions, deletions, and insertions. It showed that the expression of oprD decreased while mexA and mexX increased by real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR. These results suggested that the loss of OprD and overexpression of mexXY-OprM and mexAB-OprM are associated with carbapenem resistance in cephalosporin-susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
