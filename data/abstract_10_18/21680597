Antibiotic abuse and misuse have been recognized as important factors in the development and spread of antibiotic resistance. To prevent the further dissemination of resistance and to develop effective strategies to foster appropriate antibiotic consumption in all European countries, international cooperation is necessary. In comparison with some European countries, Spain shows high percentages of antibiotic resistance in several community-associated bacterial pathogens. In recent years, the health education of children has become a powerful tool for the promotion of healthy lifestyles. The e-Bug Project is a promising approach to improve the prudent use of antibiotics and hygiene habits, and to prevent disease transmission. It is expected that this project will influence Spanish children and young people, so that the adults of the future may follow healthier lifestyles and misuse antibiotics less. The implementation of the e-Bug Project in Spain is explained in this article, including an additional activity of the Ministry of Education related to the European Antibiotic Awareness Day.
