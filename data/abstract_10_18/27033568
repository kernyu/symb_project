OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the photodynamic therapy (PDT) against multi-antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (S.epidermidis) obtained from patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). METHODS: Forty-five CRS patients who had been given medical treatment but still needed endoscopic surgery were included in this study. The mucus from middle meatus was collected from these patients during surgery, followed by separation of S. aureus and S. epidermidis and drug sensitive test. The strains which could form biofilm were selected. Light emitting diode (LED) array with a major wavelength of (633+/-10) nm was used as light source and 5-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) was used as photosensitizer in this PDT experiment. The safe range of LED dose and ALA concentration which were not toxic to bacteria by themselves were confirmed, and then did PDT experiment on S. aureus and S. epidermidis. The data of bacterial colony forming unit were transformed to lgCFU before statistical analysis.The Graph Pad Prism 5 software was used to analyzed the data. RESULTS: Thirteen S. aureus and 16 S. epidermidis were included in this experiment(from 45 patients), all of them were multi-antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and four of S. aureus and five of S. epidermidis could form biofilm in each group. In planktonic S. aureus experiment, the mean lgCFU was 8.32+/-0.31 in control group whereas the experiment group was 6.47+/-0.67 (t=9.01, P<0.01), and in planktonic S. epidermidis experiment the final data was 8.34+/-0.20 (control group) and 6.97+/-0.59 (experiment group) (t=8.84, P<0.01). In biofilm S. aureus experiment, the mean lgCFU was 8.68+/-0.05 (control group), 6.90+/-0.96(experiment group) (t=3.68, P<0.05); and in biofilm S. epidermidis experiment the data was 8.67+/-0.05 (control group), 7.29+/-0.61 (experiment group, t=5.07, P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that ALA-mediated PDT on multi-antibiotic-resistant S. aureus and S. epidermidis from CRS patients was effective in vitro. Additional work defining if the PDT treatment would damage the nasal mucosa and further checking the effectiveness of PDT in vivo is still needed.
