Detection of drug resistance plays a critical role in tuberculosis treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of GenoType Mycobacteria Drug Resistance (MTBDR) assay (Hain Lifescience, Germany) and to compare it with radiometric BACTEC 460 TB system (Becton Dickinson, USA) for the detection of rifampicin (RIF) and isoniazid (INH) resistance in 84 Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) isolates. RIF resistance was identified in 6 of 7 (85.7%) isolates and INH resistance was identified in 8 of 14 (57.1%) isolates by the GenoType MTBDR assay. Compared with BACTEC system, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive values were 85.7%, 98.7%, 85.7% and 98.7% for RIF resistance; and 57.1%, 100%, 100% and 92.1% for INH resistance, respectively. GenoType MTBDR assay is reliable when tested specimen is resistant to the tested drugs. Although test was more successful in the detection of RIF resistance, it exhibited low sensitivity for the detection of INH resistance.
