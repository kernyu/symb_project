We report the first case of recurrent intravascular-catheter-related bacteremia in a pediatric hemodialysis patient caused by Delftia acidovorans, previously called Comamonas acidovorans or Pseudomonas acidovorans. The patient had a history of multiple infections of central vascular catheters with other organisms, requiring courses of antibiotics and catheter replacements. Previously reported cases of D. acidovorans infections are reviewed. The isolate appeared to become resistant to cephalosporins after antibiotic treatment, but resistance could not be confirmed with additional testing. In vitro susceptibility testing for cephalosporins is not reliable for this organism.
