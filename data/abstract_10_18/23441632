This work describes how to tune the amphiphilic conformation of alpha-mangostin, a natural compound that contains a hydrophobic xanthone scaffold, to improve its antimicrobial activity and selectivity for Gram-positive bacteria. A series of xanthone derivatives was obtained by cationic modification of the free C3 and C6 hydroxyl groups of alpha-mangostin with amine groups of different pKa values. Modified structures using moieties with high pKa values, such as AM-0016 (3b), exhibited potent antimicrobial properties against Gram-positive bacteria. Compound 3b also killed bacteria rapidly without inducing drug resistance and was nontoxic when applied topically. Biophysical studies and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that 3b targets the bacterial inner membrane, forming an amphiphilic conformation at the hydrophobic-water interface. In contrast, moieties with low pKa values reduced the antimicrobial activity of the parent compound when conjugated to the xanthone scaffold. This strategy provides a new way to improve "hits" for the development of membrane-active antibiotics that target drug-resistant pathogens.
