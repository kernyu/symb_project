The II Conference of the Group for the Study of Viral Hepatitis (GEHEP) (29 September-1 October, Spain) updated epidemiological, diagnostic and treatment aspects on viral hepatitis. The conference was mostly focused on the latest news related to HCV infection, including the successes achieved since the implementation of direct-acting antiviral agents for HCV therapy, but also in the new, future challenges for a real HCV eradication. The scenario for chronic HCV infection has dramatically changed in the last two years and most patients have been cured after 12 weeks of therapy with minimal side effects. However, as the experience of treatment increases, new challenges have emerged for the maximum optimization and success of therapy. Moreover, different issues need to be resolved for a real HCV eradication (i.e. unmasking HCV infection, prevention and diagnosis of HCV reinfections, diagnostic tools for treatment optimization). The latest advances in the knowledge on these topics were presented and discussed at this conference. Also, some interesting studies related to viral hepatitis E were addressed. This review summarizes some of the major findings reported and discussed during the GEHEP Conference.
