Being an important clinical fungal pathogen, Aspergillus (A.) fumigatus can cause fatal invasive fungal infections. Azoles are the first line drugs in treating various Aspergillus-caused diseases. Worldwidely, reports related to azole resistance in A. fumigatus have been increasing which posing a threat on the effectiveness of clinically used azole and agricultural fungicides. Currently, it has become an important public health issue. In this review, we summarize findings from literature regarding the following areas: the occurrence of azole resistance in A. fumigatus, the molecular mechanisms of resistance, contributing factors for the emergence of azole resistance, evolution of resistant strains and related control and prevention measures.
