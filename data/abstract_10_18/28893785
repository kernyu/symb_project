We evaluated the activity of the novel semisynthetic pleuromutilin lefamulin, inhibiting protein synthesis and growth, and the effect of efflux pump inactivation on clinical gonococcal isolates and reference strains (n = 251), including numerous multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant isolates. Lefamulin showed potent activity against all gonococcal isolates, and no significant cross-resistance to other antimicrobials was identified. Further studies of lefamulin are warranted, including in vitro selection and mechanisms of resistance, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, optimal dosing, and performance in randomized controlled trials.
