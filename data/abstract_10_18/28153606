Human herpesviruses are large double-stranded DNA viruses belonging to the Herpesviridae family. These viruses have the ability to establish lifelong latency into the host and to periodically reactivate. Primary infections and reactivations of herpesviruses cause a large spectrum of diseases and may lead to severe complications in immunocompromised patients. The viral DNA polymerase is a key enzyme in the lytic phase of the infection by herpesviruses. This review focuses on the structures and functions of viral DNA polymerases of herpes simplex virus (HSV) and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). DNA polymerases of HSV (UL30) and HCMV (UL54) belong to B family DNA polymerases with which they share seven regions of homology numbered I to VII as well as a delta-region C which is homologous to DNA polymerases delta. These DNA polymerases are multi-functional enzymes exhibiting polymerase, 3'-5' exonuclease proofreading and ribonuclease H activities. Furthermore, UL30 and UL54 DNA polymerases form a complex with UL42 and UL44 processivity factors, respectively. The mechanisms involved in their polymerisation activity have been elucidated based on structural analyses of the DNA polymerase of bacteriophage RB69 crystallized under different conformations, i.e. the enzyme alone or in complex with DNA and with both DNA and incoming nucleotide. All antiviral agents currently used for the prevention or treatment of HSV and HCMV infections target the viral DNA polymerases. However, long-term administration of these antivirals may lead to the emergence of drug-resistant isolates harboring mutations in genes encoding viral enzymes that phosphorylate drugs (i.e., nucleoside analogues) and/or DNA polymerases.
