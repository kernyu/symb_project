New antimalarial drugs are urgently needed to combat emerging multidrug resistant strains of malaria parasites. This Highlight focuses on plant-derived natural products that are of interest as potential leads towards new antimalarial drugs including synthetic analogues of natural compounds, with the exception of artemisinin derivatives, which are not included due to limited space. Since effective antimalarial treatment is often unavailable or unaffordable to many of those who need it, there is increasing interest in the development of locally produced herbal medicines; recent progress in this area will also be reviewed in this Highlight.
