PURPOSE: To determine the ocular toxicity of intravitreally injected daptomycin, a novel antibiotic for treatment of vancomycin-resistant organisms, and its efficacy in treating intraocular infection with coagulase-negative Staphylococcus epidermidis. METHODS: Four doses of intravitreal daptomycin were injected (75, 188, 375, and 750 mug) into 1 eye of Dutch belted rabbits (n = 3 per dose). Clinical examination, electroretinography, and histologic analysis were performed preinjection and 2 weeks after injection and compared with the fellow eye that received only intravitreal balanced salt solution. Experimental S epidermidis endophthalmitis was induced in Dutch belted rabbits (n = 24), and the ability of 200 mug of intravitreal daptomycin to result in culture-negative vitreous samples was measured at 24 hours and 48 hours. RESULTS: Seventy-five micrograms and 188 mug of daptomycin demonstrated acceptable safety profiles when injected intravitreally in Dutch belted rabbits. There was a dose-dependent increase in cataract formation, electroretinogram suppression, and photoreceptor damage with higher doses. Two hundred micrograms of intravitreal daptomycin resulted in near-complete vitreous sterilization 24 hours after treatment. Vitreous sterilization was complete by 48 hours. CONCLUSION: A dose of 200 mug of intravitreal daptomycin appears to be safe and efficacious in a rabbit model of bacterial endophthalmitis. Future investigations should focus on daptomycin as a therapeutic option for treating intraocular infection caused by vancomycin-resistant organisms.
