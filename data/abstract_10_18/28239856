BACKGROUND: This study was performed to investigate the efficacy of a morantel-abamectin combination for the treatment of macrocyclic lactone (ML)-resistant Parascaris spp. infections in foals. METHODS: Foals on five properties with a Parascaris faecal egg count (FEC) > 50 eggs per gram were used to estimate the FEC reduction (FECR) and efficacy of the anthelmintic combination. RESULTS & CONCLUSION: On all properties, resistance to ivermectin and abamectin was present and the Parascaris FECR in foals administered the morantel-abamectin combination was > 99%, indicating that this combination effectively controlled ML-resistant parasites.
