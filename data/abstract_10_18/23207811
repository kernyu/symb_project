Urinary tract infections are a real public health problem. They are a frequent reason for consultation as they entail a significant and sometimes inappropriate prescription of antibiotics. This is a retrospective study which involved 1,334 patients between October 2007 and February 2011. Enterobacteriaceae accounted for 85% of isolated bacteria, predominantly Escherichia coli (60%). Gram-positive bacteria account for only 11%. The highest rate of acquired resistance of Escherichia coli was observed with ampicillin (70%). This study give an idea on the rates of antibiotic resistance of the main bacteria involved in urinary tract infections and illustrate the importance of the proper use of antibiotics coupled to surveillance in order to control the spread of these resistances.
