We investigated whether raising HDL-cholesterol levels with cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibition improves glucose homeostasis in dyslipidemic and insulin resistant hamsters. Compared with vehicle, torcetrapib 30 mg/kg/day (TOR) administered for 10 days significantly increased by approximately 40% both HDL-cholesterol levels and 3H-tracer appearance in HDL after 3H-cholesterol labeled macrophages i.p. injection. TOR significantly reduced fasting plasma triglycerides, glycerol and free fatty acids levels by 65%, 31% and 23%, respectively. TOR also reduced blood glucose levels and plasma insulin by 20% and 49% respectively, which led to a 60% reduction in HOMA-IR index (all p<0.01). After 3H-2-deoxyglucose and insulin injection, TOR significantly increased glucose uptake in oxidative soleus muscle, liver and heart by 26, 33 and 70%, respectively. Raising HDL levels with the CETP inhibitor torcetrapib improves glucose homeostasis in dyslipidemic and insulin resistant hamsters. Whether similar effect would be observed with other CETP inhibitors should be investigated.
