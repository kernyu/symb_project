OBJECTIVE: To determine the resistance patterns of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to currently available anti-pseudomonal drugs and frequency of nosocomial infections caused by multi drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in hospitals. METHODS: Clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were collected from patients admitted in different hospitals of Karachi between July 2012 and June 2013. The isolates were identified by conventional and Analytical Profile Index 20NE kit methods while the antibiograms of these isolates were determined by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. RESULTS: Of the 204 isolates, 79(39%) were obtained from intensive care units: Overall, 135(66%) isolates belonged to men, and 35(17.2%) belonged to 10-15 year age group. The overall antibiogram pattern showed high resistance to commonly used antibiotics like Ofloxacin 125(61.3%), Cefepime 117(57.3%), Ceftazidime 110(53.9%), Amikacin 108(53%). Of all the isolates, 129(63.2%) were considered multidrug resistant. The most effective antibiotics were Colistin, Polymyxin B and Meropenem. CONCLUSION: Increasing multidrug resistance among nosocomial pathogens is an alarming situation in a hospital setting and requires prompt management of these cases.
