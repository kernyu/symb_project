We report the complete nucleotide sequence of the pKpS90 plasmid, carrying the bla(KPC-2) and bla(SHV-12) genes. This plasmid was isolated from a sequence type 258 (ST258) Klebsiella pneumoniae strain responsible for an outbreak in a French university hospital in 2009. pKpS90 is a 53,286-bp plasmid that belongs to the IncX incompatibility group. pKpS90 consists of a backbone from IncX plasmids, in which the KPC-2-encoding Tn4401 transposon and a bla(SHV-12)-encoding region have been inserted.
