beta-Lactamases are the most important mechanisms of resistance to the beta-lactam antibacterials. There are two mechanistic classes of beta-lactamases: the serine beta-lactamases (SBLs) and the zinc-dependent metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs). Avibactam, the first clinically useful non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor, is a broad-spectrum SBL inhibitor, which is used in combination with a cephalosporin antibiotic (ceftazidime). There are multiple reports on the interaction of avibactam with SBLs but few such studies with MBLs. We report biochemical and biophysical studies on the binding and reactivity of avibactam with representatives from all 3 MBL subfamilies (B1, B2, and B3). Avibactam has only limited or no activity versus MBL-mediated resistance in pathogens. Avibactam does not inhibit MBLs and binds only weakly to most of the MBLs tested; in some cases, avibactam undergoes slow hydrolysis of one of its urea N-CO bonds followed by loss of CO2, in a process different from that observed with the SBLs studied. The results suggest that while the evolution of MBLs that more efficiently catalyze avibactam hydrolysis should be anticipated, pursuing the development of dual-action SBL and MBL inhibitors based on the diazabicyclooctane core of avibactam may be productive.
