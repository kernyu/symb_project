OBJECTIVE: To explore the differences in sensitivity to rapamycin of five esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines with different differentiation and the changes of sensitivity of the cells after siRNA-interfered expression of p70S6K. METHODS: Effects of rapamycin on proliferation of ESCC cell lines with different differentiation, EC9706, TE-1, Eca109, KYSE790 and KYSE450 cells, were investigated using cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8) assay, and according to the above results, the EC9706 cells non-sensitive to rapamycin were chosen to be transfected with p70S6K-siRNA. The changes in sensitivity of cells to rapamycin were measured in vitro and in vivo using CCK-8 kit, flow cytometry and tumor formation in nude mice. RESULTS: CCK-8 results showed that all the five cell line cells were sensitive to low concentration of rapamycin (<100 nmol/L), but TE-1 and EC9706 cells, which were with poor differentiation, showed resistance to high concentration of rapamycin. After EC9706 cells were treated with 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1 000 nmol/L rapamycin and p70S6K-siRNA, the proliferation rates of EC9706 cells were (48.67 +/- 1.68)%, (15.45 +/- 1.54)%, (14.00 +/- 0.91)%, (10.97 +/- 0.72)% and (2.70 +/- 0.32)%, respectively, and were significantly lower than that of cells treated with 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1 000 nmol/L rapamycin and control siRNA [(74.53 +/- 1.71)%, (68.27 +/- 1.35)%, (71.74 +/- 2.44)%, (76.23 +/- 1.02)% and (80.21 +/- 2.77)%] (P<0.05 for all). The results of flow cytometry showed that the ratios of cells in G1 phase of the p70S6K-siRNA, rapamycin and p70S6K-siRNA+ rapamycin groups were (53.82 +/- 1.78)%, (57.87 +/- 4.01)% and (73.73 +/- 3.68)%, respectively, significantly higher than that in the control group (46.09 +/- 2.31)% (P<0.05 for all). The results of tumor formation test in vivo showed that the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on tumor growth was stronger after the cells were transfected with p70S6K-siRNA, and the inhibition rate was 96.5%. CONCLUSION: ESCC cells with different differentiation have different sensitivity to rapamycin, and p70S6K-siRNA can improve the sensitivity of cells to rapamycin in vitro and in vivo.
