AZD5099 (compound 63) is an antibacterial agent that entered phase 1 clinical trials targeting infections caused by Gram-positive and fastidious Gram-negative bacteria. It was derived from previously reported pyrrolamide antibacterials and a fragment-based approach targeting the ATP binding site of bacterial type II topoisomerases. The program described herein varied a 3-piperidine substituent and incorporated 4-thiazole substituents that form a seven-membered ring intramolecular hydrogen bond with a 5-position carboxylic acid. Improved antibacterial activity and lower in vivo clearances were achieved. The lower clearances were attributed, in part, to reduced recognition by the multidrug resistant transporter Mrp2. Compound 63 showed notable efficacy in a mouse neutropenic Staphylococcus aureus infection model. Resistance frequency versus the drug was low, and reports of clinical resistance due to alteration of the target are few. Hence, 63 could offer a novel treatment for serious issues of resistance to currently used antibacterials.
