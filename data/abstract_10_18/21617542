BACKGROUND/AIM: Clevudine and entecavir are highly potent antiviral agents being used in treatment of chronic hepatitis B. However, no data comparing clinical efficacy and safety of these 2 drugs over a long-term period is available. The aims of this study are to compare virologic, biochemical, and serologic response rates of clevudine and entecavir, as well as treatment failure rates up to 2 years. METHODS: Data of patients who started clevudine (n = 86) or entecavir (n = 159) as a primary treatment for chronic hepatitis B at Korea University Ansan or Guro Hospital between January 2007 and June 2008 were analyzed. RESULTS: Treatment responses were compared at 3-month intervals up to 24 months. Per protocol analysis showed no difference in virologic responses between the 2 groups at all time points, except at 18 months. When analyzed on intention-to-treat basis for virologic response at 24 months, the response rates were 45.3% in the clevudine group and 72.3% in the entecavir group, which are significantly different (P < 0.001). Rates of biochemical response and HBeAg seroconversion were not significantly different between the groups at all time points. Up to 24 months, antiviral resistance developed in 18 patients (24.4%) in the clevudine group. Clevudine was discontinued owing to muscle-related problems in 10 patients (11.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Although both drugs showed potent antiviral activity, entecavir showed better virologic response at 24 months, primarily owing to treatment failures in the clevudine group that were associated with development of drug resistance and muscle-related problems.
