OBJECTIVE: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most important causes of nosocomial infections and can acquire resistant to many antimicrobials, including beta-lactams. The aim of this study was to detect the prevalence of SHV type extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), antimicrobial resistance patterns of the P. aeroginusa and risk factors in hospitalized patients in two teaching hospitals in Sanandaj, Iran. METHODOLOGY: 123 P. aeruginosa were isolated from various clinical specimens. All samples were prepared for double-disk synergy test on the isolates for detection of ESBL. SHV was confirmed by PCR method. Risk factors were evaluated for infection due to P. aeruginosa. RESULTS: The incidence of multiple drug resistance (MDR) in P. aeroginusa isolates was 3.85%. The prevalence of ESBL-SHV gene was 10.57%. Days of hospitalization (OR=14.34 CI95% 2.87-25.8), ICU hospitalization (OR=3.4 CI95% 1.24- 9.29), presence of catheter (OR=3.63 CI 95% 1.34-9.84), use of antimicrobials within previous two weeks (OR=5.51 CI95% 1.85-16.43) and use of ventilator (OR=3.7557 CI95%1.29-9) were risk factors for Pseudomonas nosocomial infection SHV positive ESBL. CONCLUSION: In this study Prevalence of ESBL, SHV gene and MDR in P. aeroginosa infection was lower than the prevalence reported from other studies in Iran and this indicated appropriate antimicrobial managements strategies and infection control. In addition, our research data indicate that risk factors such as use of ventilator, use of antimicrobials and ICU hospitalization can be effective in managing Pseudomonas infection.
