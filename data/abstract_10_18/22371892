We sequenced the full lengths of the gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE genes in 13 fluoroquinolone-resistant Ureaplasma isolates (levofloxacin MICs, 4 to 32 mug/ml) and 10 susceptible isolates (MICs </= 2 mug/ml). Mutations were detected in all resistant isolates but in none of the susceptible isolates. The most prevalent mutation was the S83L substitution in the ParC protein. No plasmid-mediated fluoroquinolone resistance genes were detected.
