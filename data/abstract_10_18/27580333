INTRODUCTION: Infections involving methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) remain a serious threat to hospitalized patients worldwide. MRSA is characterized by recalcitrance to antimicrobial therapy, which is a function not only of widespread antimicrobial resistance, but also the capacity to form biofilms. The present study evaluated the presence of genes encoding adhesion factors and the biofilm-forming capacity in MRSA. METHODOLOGY: In this study, 53 isolates of MRSA, recovered from December 2010 to May 2014 in a mother and child hospital, CHU Mohamed VI in Marrakech, Morocco, were screened for the presence of bap and ica genes associated with biofilm formation, and for bbp, cna, ebpS, eno, fib, fnbA, fnbB, clfA, and clfB genes that encode microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMMs). The biofilm formation assay was performed in 96-well microtiter polystyrene plates. The presence of genes was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: An association was found between icaD gene detection and biofilm formation; 100% of the strains harbored icaD and produced biofilm. None of the isolates harbored bap or bbp. Furthermore, 96.23% isolates were positive for fnbA, 60.37% for eno, 43.39% for clfA and clfB, 11.32% for cna, 9.34% for ebpS, 5.66% for fib, and 1.89% for fnbA. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that the MRSA carriage in Marrakech children was high. The genetic variations of adhesion genes require further investigation.
