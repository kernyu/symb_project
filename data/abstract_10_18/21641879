The development of new antiplasmodial drugs is of primary importance due to the growing problem of multi-drug resistance of malaria parasites. Spilanthes acmella, a plant traditionally used for the treatment of toothache, was targeted as a lead for its potential antiplasmodial activity. A systematic approach for investigating a suitable centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC) solvent system for N-alkylamides separation was reported. The partition behavior of three N-alkylamides has been studied using several biphasic solvent mixtures in search of an adequate CPC solvent system for this class of compounds. Major N-alkylamides in S. acmella were isolated from a methanolic crude extract of flowers by CPC with the solvent system heptanes-ethyl acetate-methanol-water (3:2:3:2, v/v/v/v). Four N-alkylamides were purified and the structures were illustrated by electrospray ionization-ion trap-time of flight-mass spectrometry (ESI-IT-TOF-MS), (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H NMR) and (1)(3)C nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)(3)C NMR). The CPC fractions, which contained natural mixtures of phytochemicals, demonstrated significantly higher antiplasmodial activity compared to corresponding purified N-alkylamides, thus suggesting that interactions between these N-alkylamides may potentiate antiplasmodial bioactivity.
