Using crude whole-genome assemblies, we analyzed 25 isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae by using a high-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) approach for nine housekeeping genes, characterizing penA alleles, and antimicrobial susceptibility phenotypes coupled with population structure analysis. Two clonal complexes, characterized by their spatial and geographical persistence, were identified. In addition, the clonal spread of penicillin-resistant/intermediate phenotypes and a novel introduction of the azithromycin resistance phenotype in Saskatchewan, Canada, were ascertained using this method.
