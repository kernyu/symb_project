INTRODUCTION: Resistances to antimicrobials pose serious public health challenges. This issue concerns both human and veterinary medicine and can only be solved by a multidisciplinary approach. A comprehensive concept is, therefore, being worked out within the StAR (strategy antibiotic resistance) program in order to preserve the effectiveness of antibiotics for humans as well as animals. In this context, the AntibioticScout (www.AntibioticScout. ch) offers a new online tool for the prudent use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine. By involving all stakeholders, the guidelines included in the AntibioticScout will result in a nationwide accepted standard for the treatment of bacterial infections in animals. An additional system for the rapid reporting of cases of suspected lack of efficacy of antimicrobials is integrated to allow early detection of emerging resistance and the immediate launch of risk mitigation measures. A first version of the AntibioticScout for the treatment of dogs, cats and horses is available by the end of 2016. All stakeholders are now invited to contribute to the development of the AntibioticScout decision support.
