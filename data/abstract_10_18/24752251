Salmonella infection is an important public health issue for which the needs of antimicrobial treatment are increasing. A total of 546 human clinical S. enterica serovar Typhimurium isolates were recovered from patients in hospitals in China during the period of 2005 to approximately 2011. Twenty percent of the isolates exhibited resistance to ciprofloxacin, and 4% were resistant to ceftriaxone. Importantly, for the first time, 12 (2%) S. Typhimurium isolates resistant to both ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone were recovered; among these 12 isolates, two were also resistant to azithromycin, and one was resistant to all other drugs tested. The combined effects of various transferrable extended-spectrum beta-lactamase determinants and a novel efflux-based ciprofloxacin resistance mechanism encoded by the mobile efflux gene oqxAB were responsible for the emergence of these extremely (highly) drug-resistant (XDR) S. Typhimurium isolates. The dissemination of resistance genes, such as those encoding ESBLs and the OqxAB pump, among Salmonella organisms will speed up the selection of XDR Salmonella, posing a huge threat to public health and Salmonella infection control.
