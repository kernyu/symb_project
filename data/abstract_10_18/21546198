The recently determined serotypes 6C and 6D Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as subtypes 6B-I and 6B-II, were not reported in China. Among the 171 invasive isolates, 19 were identified as serogroup 6. There were equal distribution (42.1%) of 6B-I and 6B-II, 15.8% of 6A and lack of 6C and 6D. Among 1662 noninvasive isolates, 210 were identified as serogroup 6. The rates of types 6A, 6B-I, 6B-II, 6C, and 6D were 42.4%, 21.0%, 29.1%, 4.8%, and 2.9%, respectively. Subtype 6B-II was more resistant to antibiotics than others. The main sequence types (STs) of serotype 6C and 6D isolates were ST2912 and ST982, respectively. These results suggested that all recognized types of serogroup 6 can be found in China and that subtype 6B-II was more drug resistant. The epidemic STs of serotype 6C and 6D did not show genetic association with the STs spreading in other countries.
