The formation of metal nanoparticles is one of the most vast and intensifying research areas in favor of prospective applications for the advancement of new technologies. It is a well-founded, significant feature of green chemistry that making marvelous interconnection between nano-biotechnology and microbial biotechnology. In the present research, the aqueous extract of medicinally important plant Coptis Chinensis (in Chinese called "gold thread") was applied for the synthesis of gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs). The crystalline structure, size, shape and dispersion of Au-NPs were confirmed by using various characterization techniques i.e. X-ray Diffraction (XRD), High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope (HRTEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX). Well dispersed face centered cubic crystalline structures were obtained in the this contribution. The possible phyto-chemicals involved in the reduction and stabilization of Au-NPs were confirmed by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR). The prepared NPs were tested against highly drug resistance bacterium Escherichia coli both in light and dark. The results illustrated that the antibacterial efficiency of photo irradiated Au-NPs was several times higher than in dark Au-NPs. The zone of inhibition for irradiated Au-NPs was19 +/- 0.5 mm, which was higher than in dark 14 +/- 0.4 mm. This high antibacterial activity of photo irradiated Au-NPs are due to the production of reactive oxygen species which is responsible for the inhibition of bacteria.
