AIM: To determine changes in the antibiotic resistance of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) in southern Taiwan after failure of first-line standard triple therapy. METHODS: We analyzed 137 H. pylori-infected isolates from patients who experienced eradication failure after standard first-line triple therapy from January 2010 to December 2014. The H. pylori strains were tested for susceptibility to amoxicillin, clarithromycin, levofloxacin, metronidazole and tetracycline using the E-test method. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by the agar dilution test. MIC values of >/= 0.5, >/= 1, >/= 1, >/= 4 and >/= 8 mg/L were considered to be the resistance breakpoints for amoxicillin, clarithromycin, levofloxacin, tetracycline and metronidazole, respectively. RESULTS: A high resistance rate was found for clarithromycin (65%-75%) and metronidazole (30%-40%) among patients who failed first-line standard therapy. The resistance levels to amoxicillin and tetracycline remained very low; however, levofloxacin resistance was as high as 37.5% in 2010 but did not increase any further during the past 5 years. The rates of resistance to these antibiotics did not show a statistically significant upward or downward trend. CONCLUSION: Antibiotic resistance of H. pylori remains a problem for the effective eradication of this pathogen and its associated diseases in Taiwan. High clarithromycin resistance indicated that this antibiotic should not be prescribed as a second-line H. pylori eradication therapy. Moreover, levofloxacin-based second-line therapy should be used cautiously, and the local resistance rates should be carefully monitored.
