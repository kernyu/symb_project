Ciprofloxacin (CP) is a fluoroquinolone that is highly active against diverse microorganisms. At concentrations less than 1 microg/ml it is active against a diverse types of bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillius subtilius, Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In addition, it has shown to be effective against other diseases such as malaria, cancer and AIDS. The extended antimicrobial activity, lack of plasmid-mediated resistance, large volume of distribution and minimal adverse effects of CP are therapeutically advantageous. In the pursuit of increasing their effectiveness against these diseases and prevent unwanted resistance, researchers have begun to synthesize a class of organic, inorganic and organometallic derivatives, which have displayed interesting activities. This review describes the development and recent advances on the evaluation of CP and its derivatives as a new class of drugs with potential for clinical development.
