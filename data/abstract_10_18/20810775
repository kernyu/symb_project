Mupirocin is widely used to decolonize patients carrying Staphylococcus aureus, especially methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). The aim of this study was to determine the presence of high-level mupirocin resistance by a new commercially available mupA genotypic diagnostic product, mupA EVIGENE assay (AdvanDx).
