The antimicrobial resistance patterns to 15 antimicrobial agents of Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio alginolyticus isolated from farmed fishes, including olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus), black rockfish (Sebastes schlegeli), red sea bream (Pagrus major), and sea bass (Lateolabrax japonicus), were investigated from 2005 through 2007. A total of 218 V. parahaemolyticus isolates and 153 V. alginolyticus isolates were obtained from the 180 fish samples collected from fish farms located along the southern coast of Korea. We found that 65.1% of V. parahaemolyticus and 85.6% of V. alginolyticus isolates showed antimicrobial resistance against more than one antimicrobial agent. The prevalence of resistance in V. parahaemolyticus isolates to ampicillin was highest (57.8%), followed by resistance to rifampin (11.9%), streptomycin (8.7%), and trimethoprim (6.4%). V. alginolyticus isolates were also most resistant to ampicillin (75.2%), followed by tetracycline (15.0%), trimethoprim (12.4%), and rifampin (9.8%). The prevalence of multiresistance to four or more antimicrobials was higher in V. alginolyticus (11.1%) than in V. parahaemolyticus (5%). Antimicrobial resistance rates per isolate of V. parahaemolyticus and V. alginolyticus possessing virulence genes were not different from those of the rest of the isolates.
