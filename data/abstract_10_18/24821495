Bacterial resistance to antibiotics has become a public health issue. Over the years, pathogenic organisms with resistance traits have been studied due to the threat they pose to human well-being. However, several studies raised awareness to the often disregarded importance of environmental bacteria as sources of resistance mechanisms. In this work, we analyze the diversity of antibiotic-resistant bacteria occurring in aquatic environments of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, that are subjected to distinct degrees of anthropogenic impacts. We access the diversity of aquatic bacteria capable of growing in increasing ampicillin concentrations through 16S rRNA gene libraries. This analysis is complemented by the characterization of antibiotic resistance profiles of isolates obtained from urban aquatic environments. We detect communities capable of tolerating antibiotic concentrations up to 600 times higher than the clinical levels. Among the resistant organisms are included potentially pathogenic species, some of them classified as multiresistant. Our results extend the knowledge of the diversity of antibiotic resistance among environmental microorganisms and provide evidence that the diversity of drug-resistant bacteria in aquatic habitats can be influenced by pollution.
