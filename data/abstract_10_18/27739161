BACKGROUND: The use of photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy (PACT) to treat localized Candida infections is an emerging and promising therapeutic approach. AIM: To assess the photodynamic inactivation (PDI) efficacy of haematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME) on the biofilms produced by standard (ATCC 10231) and fluconazole-resistant Candida albicans strains. METHODS: The PDI efficacy was evaluated by incubating C. albicans biofilms with 0.01-10 mumol/L HMME for 30 min in the dark, followed by irradiation with 400-800 nm light for 30 min. RESULTS: HMME inactivated the biofilms in a concentration-dependent manner in the presence of light, but it exhibited no significant toxicity without light. After treatment with 10 mumol/L HMME and irradiation for 30 min, 2.47 and 3.26 log10 reductions in survival were achieved for C. albicans ATCC 10231 and fluconazole-resistant C. albicans, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Biofilms formed by the two strains were sensitive to HMME-mediated PDI.
