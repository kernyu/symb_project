Antibiotic susceptibility of 119 coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated at hospitals of St. Petersburg and Moscow was investigated and estimated at the local laboratories as oxacillin resistant. The following species were identified: Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. hominis, S.capitis, S. simulans, S. pettenkoferi, S. lentus, S. carnosus and S. warneri. The oxacillin resistance was confirmed in 79.8% of the isolates. The frequency of the associated resistance to non-beta-lactams was much higher in the oxacillin resistant isolates vs. the oxacillin susceptible ones. When the CLSI and EUCAST susceptibility criteria were used, 1-3% difference in the resistance levels was recorded. Among the oxacillin resistant isolates the frequency of resistance to gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, moxifloxacin, tetracycline and clindamycin equaled 90, 88, 88, 63, 43 and 26% respectively. Two linezolid resistant isolates of S. epidermidis with lower susceptibility to tedizolid were isolated. Eight isolates of S. epidermidis showed lower resistance to mupirocin. The MIC of ceftarolin for oxacillin resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci varied from 0.5 to 2.0 mcg/ml, while for the oxacillin susceptible ones it was lower than 0.25 mcg/ml. No resistance to tigecyclin and vancomycin was observed.
