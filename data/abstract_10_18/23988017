Integrons are important genetic elements implicated in acquisition and expression of antimicrobial resistance genes. Gene cassettes of class 1 integrons may be differently expressed depending on the Pc promoter variant. Thirty-four Escherichia coli isolates (carrying 38 class 1 integrons), recovered from poultry meat in previous studies in Tunisia and selected by their specific traits, were further characterized in this study. Integron promoter variants and the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of isolates were determined. Three types of promoter variants were identified among the 38 class 1 integrons (PcW, PcH1, and PcS); the weak promoters were the most predominant. A high clonal diversity of the E. coli strains was demonstrated by PFGE or by MLST. Fifteen PFGE profiles were detected among 19 integron-positive isolates of phylogroup B2, and 12 different sequence types were identified by MLST among the remaining 15 isolates (ST48, ST88, ST101, ST117, ST155, ST189, ST351, ST359, ST410, ST641, ST665, and one new ST). These data reflect that the presence of integrons in these isolates is not due to the clonal dispersion but to dissemination of genetic structures carrying integrons in different clones. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report examining the gene cassette promoter variants in class 1 integrons of E. coli isolates from poultry meat origin. The predominance of promoters implicated in weak expression/high excision activity of gene cassette arrays is of interest because they could theoretically enhance the capacity of integrons to adapt to antibiotic pressure.
