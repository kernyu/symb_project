The treatment of Gram-negative infections is increasingly compromised by the spread of resistance. With few agents currently in development, clinicians are now considering the use of unorthodox combination therapies for multidrug-resistant strains. Here we assessed the in vitro activity of the novel lipoglycopeptide telavancin (TLV) when combined with colistin (COL) versus 13 Gram-negative type strains and 66 clinical isolates. Marked synergy was observed in either checkerboard (fractional inhibitory concentration index [FICI], <0.5; susceptibility breakpoint index [SBPI], >2) or time-kill assays (>2-log reduction in viable counts compared with starting inocula at 24 h) versus the majority of COL-susceptible enterobacteria, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Acinetobacter baumannii isolates, but only limited effects were seen against Pseudomonas aeruginosa or strains with COL resistance. Using an Etest/agar dilution method, the activity of TLV was potentiated by relatively low concentrations of COL (0.25 to 0.75 mug/ml), reducing the MIC of TLV from >32 mug/ml to </= 1 mug/ml for 35% of the clinical isolates. This provides further evidence that glycopeptide-polymyxin combinations may be a useful therapeutic option in the treatment of Gram-negative infections.
