INTRODUCTION: The rise in antimicrobial resistance is a major global concern and requires new treatment strategies. The use of helper compounds, such as thioridazine (TDZ), an antipsychotic drug, in combination with traditional antibiotics must be investigated. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of TDZ as a helper compound for dicloxacillin (DCX) against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in vivo, and compare the combination treatment of DCX+TDZ with vancomycin (VAN). METHODS: Mice were inoculated with an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of MRSA (108 CFU) and treated in a 12-hour cycle for 48 hours. By termination, bacterial quantities in a peritoneal flush, spleen and kidneys were obtained. In the main trial the drugs were administered subcutaneously in five treatment groups: 1) DCX, 2) TDZ, 3) DCX+TDZ, 4) VAN, 5) SALINE. Additional smaller studies with IP administration and higher subcutaneous dosages (x1.5 and x4) of the drugs were subsequently performed. RESULTS: In the main trial no significant differences were found between DCX+TDZ and DCX or TDZ alone (p>/=0.121-0.999). VAN performed significantly better than DCX+TDZ on all bacteriological endpoints (p<0.001). Higher subcutaneous dosages of DCX and TDZ improved the antibacterial efficacy, but the combination treatment was still not significantly better than monotherapy. IP drug administration of DCX+TDZ revealed a significantly better antibacterial effect than DCX or TDZ alone (p<0.001) but not significantly different from VAN (p>0.999). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, TDZ did not prove to be a viable helper compound for dicloxacillin against MRSA in subcutaneous systemic treatment. However, IP-administration of DCX+TDZ, directly at the infection site resulted in a synergetic effect, with efficacy comparable to that of VAN.
