Novel agents such as thalidomide, bortezomib, and lenalidomide have improved outcomes and extended survival in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). These agents appear to be most effective when used at first relapse rather than later in the treatment sequence; however, the optimal duration of therapy has not been defined. Continuous therapy from relapse to disease progression may be able to maintain suppression of residual disease, thereby extending overall survival. This article reviews the currently available data on treatments, including novel agents for patients with RRMM, focusing on the duration of therapy required to improve clinical outcomes.
