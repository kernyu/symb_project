BACKGROUND: The occurrence of urinary tract infection (UTI) in children with nephrotic syndrome (NS) has been widely reported by various workers, but not much has been documented about its occurrence among children with acute glomerulonephritis (AGN). Hence, the level of susceptibility to UTI by both diseases has not been compared. OBJECTIVE: To determine and compare the prevalence of UTI in children newly diagnosed of AGN or NS. METHODS: Urinary microscopy, culture and sensitivity of all children admitted with a diagnosis of NS and AGN between 1996-2004 were reviewed. Children with NS who had a relapse or were commenced on steroids, cytotoxic agents or antibiotics before admission were excluded from the study. RESULTS: A total of 35 and 32 children diagnosed of AGN and NS respectively met the study criteria. Urinary tract infection occurred in three (9%) children with AGN and one (3%) of the children with NS. The organisms isolated among the AGN patients included Coliforms, Klebsiella, and Staphylococcus aureus while Coliform was isolated in the only NS patient with UTI. CONCLUSION: There is a low prevalence of UTI in children newly diagnosed of AGN and NS.
