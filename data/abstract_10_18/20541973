Expanding drug resistance could become a major problem in malaria treatment, as only a limited number of effective antimalarials are available. Drug resistance has been associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms and an increased copy number of multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1), an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein family member. Many ABC transport proteins are membrane transporters that actively translocate a wide range of structurally and functionally diverse amphipathic compounds. The Plasmodium falciparum ABC family consists of 16 members and current knowledge of their physiological function and contribution to antimalarial drug resistance is limited. Here, we give an overview of the Plasmodium ABC family members with reference to their possible role in multidrug resistance.
