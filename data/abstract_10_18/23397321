The present study attempted to comparatively assess and establish a suitable detection method of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) from previously treated TB cases in Bangladesh. Of 130 Zeihl-Neelsen smear-positive fresh sputum specimens, 112 samples were found to contain viable bacilli as visualized under the light-emitting diode fluorescence microscope after fluorescein di-acetate staining, and 109 positive cases were detected through Lowenstein-Jensen culture. The samples were further tested to survey the drug resistance both by slide drug susceptibility test (DST) and by conventional DST: 94 MDR-TB cases were detected within 10 days through the slide DST, whereas 82 cases were observed through the conventional DST, requiring about 3 months. Because the rapidity, sensitivity and accuracy of the slide DST method were found to be comparatively satisfactory when compared to the conventional DST method; we recommend the slide DST method as the standard diagnostic tool in perspective of Bangladesh for the detection of MDR-TB.
