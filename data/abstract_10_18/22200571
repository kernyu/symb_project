Previously, we demonstrated that an inhibitor of ganglioside biosynthesis, d-PDMP, could restore impaired insulin signaling in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha)-treated adipocytes by blocking the increase of GM3 ganglioside. Here, we analyzed the interaction between insulin receptor (IR) and GM3 in the plasma membranes using immunoelectron microscopy. In normal adipocytes, most GM3 molecules localized at planar and non-caveolar regions. Approximately 19% of IR molecules were detected in caveolar regions. The relative ratio of IRs associated with caveolae in TNFalpha-treated adipocytes was decreased to one-fifth of that in normal adipocytes, but this decrease was restored by d-PDMP. Thus, we could obtain direct evidence that insulin resistance is a membrane microdomain disorder caused by aberrant expression of ganglioside.
