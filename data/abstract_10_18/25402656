RATIONALE: Timely and appropriate empiric antibiotics can improve outcomes in critically ill patients with infection. Evidence and guidelines to guide empiric antibiotic decisions are lacking for critically ill children. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of an empiric antibiotic protocol on appropriateness of initial antibiotics and time to appropriate antibiotics in critically ill children with suspected infection. METHODS: A computer order entry-based, pediatric intensive care unit-specific, empiric antibiotic protocol including risk stratification for healthcare-associated infections was implemented in a tertiary pediatric intensive care unit. Antibiotic and culture data were evaluated for a total of 556 infectious episodes in 491 patients from 2004 (preprotocol, n = 252) and 2007 (protocol, n = 304) with suspected infection. Antibiotics appropriateness based on risk factors and culture results was assessed, as was time from initial culture to appropriate antibiotics. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients treated using the protocols were more likely to receive appropriate empiric antibiotics based on risk factors (76 vs. 15%; P < 0.0001) and culture results (89 vs. 64%; P < 0.0001). Patients treated after protocol implementation had a shorter time to appropriate antibiotics (median, 5.9 vs. 9.6 h; P < 0.0001), particularly in those who grew healthcare-associated pathogens (5.8 vs. 24 h; P = 0.0001). No significant baseline characteristic differences were seen. CONCLUSIONS: An empiric antibiotic protocol in the pediatric intensive care unit incorporating risk stratification for healthcare-associated infections resulted in increased appropriateness of empiric antibiotics and in decreased time to appropriate antibiotics in critically ill children with infection.
