The clinical and microbial efficacy of antimicrobial treatments of avian colibacillosis was studied, using an experimental model on chickens previously inoculated with multiresistant commensal Escherichia coli strains. One E. coli with pMG252 plasmid containing bla(FOX5) and qnrA1 genes and another E. coli with pMG298 plasmid containing bla(CTX-M15) and qnrB1 genes were first orally inoculated to chickens Both isolates were also resistant to chloramphenicol, sulphamethoxazole, trimethoprim, streptomycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, and tetracycline. The birds were then experimentally infected with an avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC), via the air sac. Treatments (oxytetracycline (OTC), trimethoprim-sulfadimethoxin (SXT), amoxicillin (AMX) or enrofloxacin (ENR) were then offered at the therapeutic doses. Symptoms, lesions in dead or sacrificed birds, and isolation and characterization of APEC from internal organs were studied. Results showed that OTC, SXT or ENR treatments could control the pathology. AMX worsened the disease, possibly due to endotoxin shock. All APEC re-isolated from internal organs showed the same antimicrobial susceptibility as the APEC inoculated strain, except for one APEC isolate from an infected OTC-treated bird, which acquired tetracycline resistance only, and one APEC isolate recovered from the air sacs of a chicken in the infected SXT-treated group, which acquired the pMG252 plasmid and became multi-resistant. Thus three antimicrobials could control the disease but the experimental model enabled, to our knowledge, the first observation of plasmid transfer from a bacterium of the intestinal tract to a pathogenic isolate from the respiratory tract.
