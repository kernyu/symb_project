Knowledge of the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of genital Mollicutes is crucial to offer guidelines for empirical treatments. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and the resistance profile of Mycoplasma hominis (MH) and Ureaplasma urealyticum/Ureaplasma parvum (UU/UP) in genital samples over a two-year period in Bologna, Italy. From January 2015 to December 2016, data on all the subjects providing uro-genital specimens for Mollicutes detection by culture were analyzed. A total of 4660 subjects (84.4% females) were enrolled and an overall Mollicutes prevalence of 30.9% was found. Women turned positive for Mollicutes infection twice as often as men (33.3% vs 17.8%) and the detection rate progressively decreased with increasing age. Ureaplasmas represented the commonest species isolated (overall prevalence: 24.2%), whereas mixed infections (6.5%) and MH single infections (3.9%) were far less common. Ureaplasma species showed significant levels of quinolone resistance, especially to ciprofloxacin (77%), whereas MH strains were non-susceptible to azithromycin and roxithromycin in about 90% of cases. Mollicutes co-infections showed a more severe resistance pattern than single infections. Over time, the resistance rate for azithromycin and roxithromycin increased significantly. Globally, our results revealed that minocycline and doxycycline can still be first-line drugs for Mollicutes treatment.
