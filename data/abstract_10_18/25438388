Antiretroviral therapy reduces AIDS morbidity and mortality as well as decreases HIV transmission by reducing the viral load (VL). We aimed to determine the rate of immunological and virological failure that reflects antiretroviral treatment (ART) effectiveness among the patients of the Kyiv City AIDS Centre and may lead to ART switch in the future. In 59% of patients the prescribed ATR regimen was regarded as successful, in 37% as unsuccessful and 4% of patients were excluded for lacking sufficient follow-up time. Among the cases of unsuccessful ART, the largest part of patients was experiencing secondary immunological failure, on the second place was primary immunological failure. The temporal distribution of primary and secondary failures was also defined. It was shown that the number of patients with treatment failure increases steadily Drug resistance testing is able to reduce the number of unsuccessful ART regimens, but such testing is not a part of the routine testing in Ukraine.
