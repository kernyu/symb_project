The shelf-life of fresh carcasses and produce depends on the chemical and physical properties of antimicrobials currently used for treatment. For many years the gold standard of these antimicrobials has been Cetylpyridinium Chloride (CPC) a quaternary ammonium compound (QAC). CPC is very effective at removing bacterial pathogens from the surface of chicken but has not been approved for other products due to a toxic residue left behind after treatment. Currently there is also a rising trend in QAC resistant bacteria. In order to find new compounds that can combat both antimicrobial resistance and the toxic residue we have developed two Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models for Salmonella typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes. These models have been shown to be accurate and reliable through multiple internal and external validation techniques. In processing these models we have also identified important descriptors and structures that may be key in producing a viable compound. With these models, development and testing of new compounds should be greatly simplified.
