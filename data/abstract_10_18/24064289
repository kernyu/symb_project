BACKGROUND: Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as an important cause of nosocomial infections with high morbidity and mortality. The carbapenemases, especially class D carbapenem-hydrolyzing oxacillinases (CHDLs), play an important role, but the relationship between their prevalence trend and carbapenem resistance remains unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1995 and 2012, we collected 667 isolates of A. baumannii from a single medical center in northern Taiwan. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to determine clonality. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined. Carbapenemase genes and associated genetic structures were detected by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Isolates were heterogeneous on PFGE. Susceptibility to carbapenem decreased steadily over the study period from 88.1% (2001-2003) to <25% (2010-2012), whereas the isolates remained susceptible to colistin (nearly 100%) and partially susceptible to tigecycline (80%). Starting in 2001, isolates carrying the ISAba1-blaOXA-51-like allele were consistently identified. Isolates containing the transposons Tn2006 or Tn2008 first appeared in 2007 with increasing carriage rates from 17.5% (2007-2009) to 50.0% (2010-2012). The IS1008-DeltaISAba3-blaOXA-58-like, blaOXA-72 and metallo-beta-lactamase genes were detected only sporadically. Isolates carrying CHDL genes were resistant to multiple drugs, including carbapenem, but remained susceptible to colistin (100.0%). CONCLUSION: Increased carbapenem resistance in A. baumannii may be caused by the increased prevalence of isolates containing the ISAba1-blaOXA-51-like allele and the transposons Tn2006 and Tn2008.
