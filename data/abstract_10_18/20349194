There is a considerable interest in developing new anthelmintic drugs including those from medicinal plants due to increasing evidence of parasitic resistance against present anthelmintic drugs and decreasing activity against encapsulated larval stages of parasites. This study was carried out to assess, for the first time, the effectiveness of methanolic extract of Balanites aegyptiaca (BAE) fruits against different stages (pre-adult, migrating larvae, and encysted larvae) of Trichinella spiralis in rats compared with commonly used anthelmintic albendazole. Oral administration of BAE at a dose of 1,000 mg/kg b.wt. for five successive days throughout the parasite life cycle led to a marked reduction of migrating and encysted larval rate by 81.7% and 61.7%, respectively, in the muscular tissue. This treatment was less effective against adults in the gut (47.8%). Albendazole treatment at a dose of 10 mg/kg b.wt. for five successive days resulted in a marked eradication of T. spiralis adult worms (94.4%) and less reduction of migrating and encysted larval infections of skeletal muscles (62.2% and 26.4%, respectively). BAE-treated groups showed marked decreases in serum-glucose levels, triglyceride concentrations, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) activities, and lipid peroxide products (malondialdehyde, MDA) as well as an increase in glutathione level in both serum and muscular tissue compared to albendazole-treated- and infected-untreated groups. This result was confirmed by few numbers of living- and dead-encysted larvae and less destruction of the diaphragm and skeletal muscle tissues in BAE-treated groups compared to other treated groups. It can be concluded that the methanolic extract of B. aegyptiaca fruits has high effectiveness against parenteral stages of T. spiralis than albendazole. Albendazole is more effective against enteral stage of T. spiralis than the extract.
