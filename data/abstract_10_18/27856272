Despite their commensal status, staphylococci can become problematic pathogens expressing multiple and redundant virulence factors. This study aimed to evaluate aggressiveness markers comparatively in staphylococcal strains isolated from severe infections versus asymptomatic carriage in order to identify clinically relevant bacterial traits that could easily be detected in clinical practice and could be suggestive for particular host-pathogen interactions such as cyto-adhesion or biofilm formation, ultimately orienting the clinical decision-making process. We have used in vitro phenotypic methods to assess adhesion to and invasion of eukaryotic cells, biofilm development, and expression of soluble virulence factors in 92 Staphylococcus spp. strains. The adhesion index, invasion capacity, biofilm formation and expression of soluble factors did not differ significantly between clinical and commensal strains. The major bacterial traits we found to be significantly more prevalent in clinical staphylococci were the aggregative adhesion pattern (P = 0.012), cluster adhesion (P = 0.001) and tetrad morphology (P = 0.018). The aggregative adhesion pattern was correlated with higher cyto-adhesion (P < 0.001), higher invasion capacity (P = 0.003) and lower Carmeli scores (P = 0.002). Three major bacterial traits, namely tetrad morphology, aggregative adhesion pattern, and resistance to methicillin (acronym: TAM), can be used to compute an aggressiveness score (SAS) predictive of the staphylococcal strain's virulence and capacity to initiate and develop a biofilm-driven chronic infectious process versus a fulminant acute infection, in a susceptible host.
