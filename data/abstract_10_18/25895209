Influenza virus is a leading causing factor of infectious respiratory human pathology. The search and development of novel anti-influenza drugs with a wide spectrum of activity is an important goal for medical science. In addition to specific anti-viral activity of the compound, its way of application is of great importance. In this work, we present the results of the study of the activity of a combination of glutamyl-tryptophan with glycirrhyzic acid (GTGA) against oseltamivir-resistant strain of the virus A/Vladivostok/2/09 (H1N1) at per os application on the model of the lethal influenza infection in white mice. The application of the GTGA was shown to decrease the specific mortality of animals (index of protection 43-50%), to increase the mean day of death to 2.5-3.9 days, and to reduce the infectious titer of the virus in the lung tissue to 1.5-1.9 Ig EID50/20 mg. The corresponding values for the reference compound oseltamivir were 14-25%, 1.1-1.9 days and 0.7 Ig EID50/20 mg, respectively, depending on the dose of the virus. The use of the GTGA also led to a reliable increase of the titers of interferon in the blood from 44.3 to 66.3 ME/mL. Morphological analysis revealed that GTGA lead to normalization of the structure of the lung tissue restricting the level of the cytodestruction and inflammation. The results obtained in this work allow the combination studied to be suggested as a promising anti-influenza drug that is active against the drug-resistant virus strains and can be applied orally.
