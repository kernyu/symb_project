We explored the mechanism of the development from sensitivity to resistance to carbapenem in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Two P. aeruginosa strains were collected during treatment with carbapenem. Strain homology was investigated using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Porin oprD2 expression was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of imipenem and meropenem with or without MC207110 were determined using the agar dilution method. The expression level of efflux pump mRNA was tested using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Metallo-lactamases (MBLs) were screened using the EDTA-disk synergy test. Genes encoding MBLs were amplified and then analyzed by DNA sequencing. The two treated strains belonged to the same pulsed-field gel electrophoresis type. The SDS-PAGE profile of the P. aeruginosa strains revealed that the 46-kDa membrane protein OprD2 of IMP(R)MEM(R) type strains was lost, whereas OprD2 of 1 IMP(S)MEM(S) strain was normal. With or without MC207110 treatment, the MIC of carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa decreased by 4-fold, while the MIC of carbapenem-sensitive P. aeruginosa did not. Compared with the carbapenem-sensitive strain, MexX mRNA expression in the carbapenem-resistant strain increased by 102.5-fold, while the mRNA expression of other efflux pumps did not markedly increase. Neither carbapenem-resistant nor carbapenem-sensitive P. aeruginosa produced MBL. The mechanism of development from sensitivity to resistance of P. aeruginosa to carbapenem during carbapenem treatment is due to porin oprD2 loss and an increased expression level of MexXY-OprM.
