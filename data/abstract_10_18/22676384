Bacterial resistance to classical antibiotics is a serious medical problem, which continues to grow. Small antimicrobial peptides represent a potential solution and are increasingly being developed as novel therapeutic agents. Many of these peptides owe their antibacterial activity to the formation of trans-membrane ion-channels resulting in cell lysis. However, to further develop the field of peptide antibiotics, a thorough understanding of their mechanism of action is needed. Alamethicin belongs to a class of peptides called peptaibols and represents one of these antimicrobial peptides. To examine the dynamics of assembly and to facilitate a thorough structural evaluation of the alamethicin ion-channels, we have applied click chemistry for the synthesis of templated alamethicin multimers covalently attached to cyclodextrin-scaffolds. Using oriented circular dichroism, calcein release assays, and single-channel current measurements, the alpha-helices of the templated multimers were demonstrated to insert into lipid bilayers forming highly efficient and remarkably stable ion-channels.
