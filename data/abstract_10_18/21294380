OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical course, serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance patterns of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) cases in a public hospital. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Retrospective review of IPD cases occurring from January 2004 through December 2008 was performed. Antibiotic susceptibility testing and serotyping were performed for available isolates. RESULTS: Fifty one IPD cases occurred during the study period, of which 47 had medical records available for review. The majority of cases occurred among children under 5 years of age (23.4%) and adults over 60 years of age (36.1%). Underlying diseases were identified in 72.3% of patients. Fifty-three percent of cases were associated with pneumonia, while 17% had meningitis, and 15% had isolated bacteremia. Serotype could be determined for 15 (31.9%) isolates, and 6B was most common. Based on current antibiotic susceptibility breakpoints for meningitis, 4 of the 7 available isolates from meningitis cases were penicillin resistant and one had reduced susceptibility to cefotaxime. Among non-meningitis isolates, 96.7% were penicillin susceptible and 3.3% had intermediate susceptibility to penicillin. Overall case fatality proportion was 19%. CONCLUSION: At this tertiary care hospital in Bangkok, IPD has disproportionately affected young children and the elderly. High rates of penicillin resistance among meningitis cases, the most severe form of IPD, underscore the need of appropriate treatment strategies and vaccine usage.
