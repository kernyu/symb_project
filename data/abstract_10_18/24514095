In Spain, rates of ciprofloxacin resistance in pneumococci were low during the last decade (2.6% in 2002 and 2.3% in 2006). In 2012, the rate remained at 2.3%, equivalent to 83 of 3,621 isolates. Of the 83 resistant isolates, 15 showed a low level (MIC of 4 to 8 mug/ml) and 68 a high level (MIC of 16 to 128 mug/ml) of ciprofloxacin resistance. Thirteen low-level-resistant isolates had single changes in ParC, one had a single ParE change, and one did not present any mutations. High-level-resistant isolates had GyrA changes plus additional ParC and/or ParE changes: 51, 15, and 2 isolates had 2, 3, or 4 mutations, respectively. Although 24 different serotypes were observed, 6 serotypes accounted for 51.8% of ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates: 8 (14.5%), 19A (10.8%), 11A (7.2%), 23A (7.2%), 15A (6.0%), and 6B (6.0%). A decrease in pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV7) serotypes was observed from 2006 (35.7%) to 2012 (16.9%), especially of serotype 14 (from 16.3% to 2.4%; P<0.001). In comparison with findings in 2006, multidrug resistance was greater in 2012 (P=0.296), mainly due to the increased presence and/or emergence of clonal complexes associated with non-PCV7 serotypes: CC63 expressing serotypes 8, 15A, and 19A; CC320 (with serotype 19A); and CC42 (with serotype 23A). Although rates of ciprofloxacin resistance remained low and stable throughout the last decade, changes in serotype and genotype distributions were observed in 2012, notably the expansion of a preexisting multidrug-resistant clone, CC63, and the emergence of the CC156 clone expressing serotype 11A.
