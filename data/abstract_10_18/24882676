3-Arylfuran-2(5H)-one, a novel antibacterial pharmacophore targeting tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS), was hybridized with the clinically used fluoroquinolones to give a series of novel multi-target antimicrobial agents. Thus, twenty seven 3-arylfuran-2(5H)-one-fluoroquinolone hybrids were synthesized and evaluated for their antimicrobial activities. Some of the hybrids exhibited merits from both parents, displaying a broad spectrum of activity against resistant strains including both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The most potent compound (11) in antibacterial assay shows MIC50 of 0.11mug/mL against Multiple drug resistant Escherichia coli, being about 51-fold more potent than ciprofloxacin. The enzyme assays reveal that 11 is a potent multi-target inhibitor with IC50 of 1.15+/-0.07muM against DNA gyrase and 0.12+/-0.04muM against TyrRS, respectively. Its excellent inhibitory activities against isolated enzymes and intact cells strongly suggest that 11 deserves to further research as a novel antibiotic.
