Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of nosocomial diarrhea. CDI is known to develop after antibiotic administration, but anti-tuberculosis agents have rarely been implicated. We documented an outbreak caused by a highly rifampicin-resistant C. difficile strain of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ribotype 046 in patients with active tuberculosis.
