Forty years after the discovery of acyclovir (ACV), it remains the mainstay of therapy for herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections. Since then, other antiviral agents have also been added to the armamentarium for these infections but ACV remains the therapy of choice. As the efficacy of ACV is reassessed, however, it is apparent that a therapy with increased efficacy, reduced potential for resistance, and improved pharmacokinetics would improve clinical outcome, particularly in high risk patients. Inhibitors of viral targets other than the DNA polymerase, such as the helicase primase complex, are of particular interest and will be valuable as new therapeutic approaches are conceived. This review focuses on currently approved HSV therapies as well as new systemic therapies in development.
