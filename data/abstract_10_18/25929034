The activity of the phosphite of acycloguanosine (P-ACG) and six antivirals was tested individually and in double and triple combinations on two strains of the herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 (sensitive to acyclovir and resistant to acyclovir) using the CPE inhibition method in the Vero E6 cell microcultures. These are: phosphite of acycloguanosine (P-ACG), Ara-A, cidofovir (CDV), ribavirin (Rib), phosphonoformate (PFA), glycyrrhizic acid (GLN) and alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN). All studied double combinations and triple combinations including P-ACV inhibited replication of both HSV strains more effectively than any drug alone. Various types of interactions depending on the virus type were observed in both viral models: synergistic (double combinations P-ACG with PFA, CDV, Rib, alpha-IFN and triple combinations P-ACG with alpha-IFN +PFA, alpha-IFN +AraA, alpha-IFN +CDV, PFA+CDV, PFA+Rib, CDV+AraA, CDV+Rib, CDV+GLN,PFA+AraA) and additive (P-ACG with AraA and PFA+GLN). Neither antagonism nor interference was noted for any combinations. Adduced results suggest that these combinations might be clinically useful for the treatment of certain herpes simplex virus type 1 infections.
