Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were collected form a Turkish hospital. Antimicrobial susceptibility was performed using the Vitek 2 Compact system, and 24 isolates were categorized as multidrug resistant (n = 18), extensively-drug resistant (n = 5), or pan-drug resistant (n = 1). PCR and DNA sequence analysis revealed that 1 strain possessed the blaGES-5 and another carried a novel blaVIM variant, named VIM-38. This new gene exhibited 1 amino acid substitution (Ala265Val) in comparison to its closest variant, VIM-5. Both VIM encoding genes were clones and demonstrated similar susceptibility profile when expressed in identical background. The presence of VIM-38 increases the diversity of carbapenemases in Turkey.
