INTRODUCTION: Antimicrobial resistance among bacteria that cause urinary tract infection (UTI) has been increasing since the introduction of chemotherapy. This study was aimed to assess the types of isolates from patients with UTI and to determine their current antimicrobial susceptibility profile. METHODS: A record based retrospective analysis of bacterial uropathogens processed in the period of January 2012 to December 2014 at Bahir Dar Health Research Laboratory Center (BRHRLC) was determined. According to standard microbiological procedures, midstream urine samples were collected and processed with conventional culture and biochemical tests. Isolates were tested against commonly used antibiotics by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion methods. Chi-square test was calculated to compare the proportion of bacterial isolates between sex and age and statistical significance was set at p value < 0.05. RESULTS: Out of 446 patients, female constituted at 299 (67%). Significant bacteriuria was reported on 30.5% (95% CI: 26.4-34.9%) cultures. Of these, 78% (95% CI: 71.0-84.7%) were from females. Age and sex were found associated with significant bacteriuria at p=0.046 and p=0.001 respectively. The most commonly identified isolates were Escherichia coli, at 72 (49 %) followed by Klebshella pneumonia at 20 (13.6%) and Pseudomonas aureginosa at 11 (7.5%). The overall antimicrobial susceptibility profile showed that Trimetoprim-sulphamethoxazole, amoxicillin/clavulanate and ampicillin revealed high level of resistance, at 84(66.7%), 61(79.2%), 106(91.4% respectively. Conversely, 64.2-100% sensitivity rate was documented for ciprofloxacin, gentamycin and pepracillin. CONCLUSION: UTI associated with multiple drug resistant bacteria is an important health concern of the study population. Therefore, ongoing surveillance of the types of uropathogens and their up-to-date antimicrobial resistance profile is crucial for better management of patients.
