The study was an analysis of the frequency of urine bacterial isolation in hospitalized children as well as an evaluation of their susceptibility to antibiotics used in urinary tract infections (UTI). The analysis focused on microbiological urine tests carried out between January 2006 and December 2008. Altogether, 311 strains were obtained, of which E. coli (50.8%) and E. faecalis (13.5%) were the most frequently isolates. The highest percentage of Enterobacteriaceae were sensitive to ceftazidime (92%); to a lesser degree to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (85%), to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (84%), to nitrofurantoin (82%), to cefuroxime (81%), to cefalotin (66%) whereas only 24% were sensitive to ampicillin. ESBLs were produced by 8% of all Enterobacteriaceae strains. P. aeruginosa strains were totally sensitive to ceftazidime; over 90% - to piperacillin and aminoglycosides, and 77% to carbenicillin. Staphylococci manifested 100% sensitivity to nitrofurantoin. Only 20% of S. aureus were sensitive to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and to trimethoprim; in the case of S. epidermidis: 83% and 67% respectively. No resistant strains were found among S. agalactiae and E. faecalis. E. faecium strains, in turn, were resistant to ampicillin and often to nitrofurantoin (64%), to vancomycin (VanB; 45%) and to high aminoglycoside concentrations (HLAR; 45%).
