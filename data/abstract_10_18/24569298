The effectiveness of fosfomycin was examined across 31 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) strains by agar dilution. Prevalence of the fosfomycin-resistance determinant gene, fosB, was assessed by PCR analysis. Results found that 84% of isolates were fosfomycin-susceptible. Interestingly, 87% of isolates possessed fosB, indicating no association between this putative staphylococci resistance gene and phenotypic resistance. Further evaluation of fosfomycin as a potential treatment of MRSP in dogs is warranted.
