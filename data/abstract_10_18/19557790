The susceptibility of meniscus allografts to enzymatic degradation may be reduced through tissue stabilization. We have previously reported on an epoxide-based crosslinker, triglycidyl amine (TGA), which can be used alone or with a bisphosphonate (MABP) to stabilize heterograft heart valves and reduce their pathologic calcification. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of TGA and TGA-MABP pretreatment on an orthopedic allograft involving meniscus crosslinking, degradation, calcification, and compressive properties. Ovine menisci treated with TGA or TGA-MABP for up to seven days and glutaraldehyde crosslinked controls were examined in vitro for degree of crosslinking, resistance to degradation by collagenase, and material property changes. Likewise treated menisci were implanted in rats for eight weeks and examined for calcium content and biomechanical changes. TGA treatment for three days significantly reduced collagen loss by 88% and increased thermal denaturation temperatures (Ts) above 80 degrees C versus Ts of 70 degrees C or less for non-crosslinked meniscus. In vitro, TGA and TGA-MABP significantly increased aggregate modulus by 19% and 32% compared to native controls, respectively. TGA decreased permeability by 53% while TGA-MABP increased it by 303%. In vivo, TGA significantly reduced explant calcification by 42% compared to glutaraldehyde, and including MABP reduced it by 90%. Analyses revealed that TGA and TGA-MABP stabilized menisci had significantly lower modulus and permeability values than glutaraldehyde controls by at least 28% and 86%, respectively. It is concluded that TGA crosslinking of meniscus increases resistance to both collagenase degradation and pathologic calcification, while demonstrating comparable or improved biomechanical properties versus glutaraldehyde controls.
