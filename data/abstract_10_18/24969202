Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is the most common childhood vasculitis. Renal involvement in HSP is one of the major causes of chronic renal failure in children. It is important to start effective and relatively safe medication to prevent end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) appears to be a promising therapeutic agent in many autoimmune diseases such as lupus nephritis and vasculitis. Herein, we describe the treatment with MMF of three patients with HSP nephritis. In two cases with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis without response to steroid, after treatment with MMF, significant improvement in kidney function and proteinuria were observed. In another patient with HSP nephritic-nephrotic syndrome who showed resistance to steroid, MMF offered a favorable effect. MMF seems to be a promising therapeutic agent in the treatment of the severe HSP nephritis.
