Despite concerns about its nephrotoxicity, colistin often remains the only effective agent for treating multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections. Published studies have reported a wide range of nephrotoxicity risk factors. To assess the clinical utility of various models, we compared their performances for predicting the risk of nephrotoxicity. We identified a model demonstrating reasonable overall risk assessment, with an observed/expected ratio of 1.29 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68 to 1.90) and a positive predictive value of 87.5% for identifying patients at high risk of developing nephrotoxicity.
