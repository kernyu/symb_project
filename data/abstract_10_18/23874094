BACKGROUND: Antibiotic treatment is one of the major pharmacologic treatments for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). However, the choice of antibiotic depends on the local resistance pattern. A multicenter, randomized, controlled trial was done in patients with AECOPD to compare the efficacy of levofloxacin with that of cefuroxime axetil. METHODS: Patients with AECOPD and without radiographic evidence of pneumonia were enrolled and randomized to either levofloxacin 500 mg daily or cefuroxime 250 mg twice daily in the mildmoderate exacerbation group, or 500 mg twice daily in the severe exacerbation group, for seven days. Clinical efficacy and microbiologic response were evaluated 5-7 days after the last dose. RESULTS: Treatment was clinically successful in 90.4% of patients in the levofloxacin group, and in 90.6% of patients in the cefuroxime group (95% confidence interval -9.40 to 10.91), within a noninferiority margin of 10%. The microbiologic response appeared to be higher in the levofloxacin group, but the difference was not statistically significant. The safety profile was similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: Levofloxacin is not inferior to cefuroxime with regard to clinical efficacy in treating AECOPD.
