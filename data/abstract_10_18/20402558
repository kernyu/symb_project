IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: The emergence of resistance in treatment-experienced HIV patients often limits therapeutic success of the currently available antiretroviral drugs. New drug classes are thus required. Maraviroc is the first chemokine receptor 5 antagonist approved for use in treatment experienced HIV patients with a R5-tropic virus. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: For this review, data from pharmacokinetic, Phase II and III clinical trials were reviewed. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: The objectives of this review were to discuss the pharmacokinetics and clinical efficacy and safety of maraviroc in treatment-experienced and -naive HIV patients with R5-tropic virus. Additionally, tropism testing was discussed. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Maraviroc is effective in previously treated patients with R5-tropic virus only. Also, maraviroc will be an attractive option for HIV-1-infected treatment-naive patients with R5-tropic viruses only, once genotypic assays have been validated.
