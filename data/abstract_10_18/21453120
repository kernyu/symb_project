Since Staphylococcus aureus can cause several types of diseases, the development of antibiotic resistance poses an even greater threat to public health. S. aureus is known to possess the adaptive capability to promptly respond to antibiotics, making it resistant and increasingly difficult to treat; methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus are a major concern with regard to this species. Previous studies reported the identification of methicillin-resistant S. aureus in food, demonstrating that this can represent a source of S. aureus which may carry the mecA gene. Fifty-seven S. aureus isolates, previously obtained from different types of food, were screened by polymerase chain reaction with specific primers for the mecA gene, which mediates methicillin resistance. Five (9%) isolates showed the presence of mecA gene, demonstrating that food may contain microorganisms possessing resistance genes. This study emphasizes the need to include food as a possible source of S. aureus carrying mecA gene and the need to monitor these products. Moreover, this is the first report of the presence of mecA genes in S. aureus isolated from ready-to-eat food in Brazil and Latin America.
