Mycobacterium chelonae lung infection is rare and has long been recognized as an enigmatic infection resistant to medical therapy. Recently, we encountered a patient who underwent pulmonary resection for Mycobacterium chelonae infection. A 46-year-old man with no medical history was found to have an abnormal shadow in the left upper lung field on chest X-ray. Computed tomography showed a nodular shadow in the left upper lobe and disseminated shadows around it. Mycobacterium chelonae was detected from cultures of the sputum, bronchial washings, bronchoscopic biopsy specimens, and gastric fluid, and pulmonary infection with Mycobacterium chelonae was diagnosed. The shadow did not decrease in size despite antibiotic treatment. Since the lesion was confined to the left upper segment, we judged that a complete resection was possible, and performed left upper division segmentectomy. After surgery, no new foci of infection were observed in the lung. No effective therapy for Mycobacterium chelonae lung infection has been established to date, and reported cases of pulmonary resection for the treatment of Mycobacterium chelonae infection are extremely rare. However, surgery should be considered in patients in whom complete resection is deemed possible.
