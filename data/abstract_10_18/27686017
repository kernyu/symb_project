The current standard of care for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) consists of interferon-free direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens, including combinations of DAAs and fixed-dose combination pills. DAAs for HCV are likely to be heralded as one of medicine's greatest advancements. Viral eradication rates are pushing 100% for many HCV-infected populations, including patients with HIV/HCV coinfection, decompensated cirrhosis, liver and kidney transplants, and end-stage liver disease. We highlight the greatest successes of combination DAA therapies, discuss the ongoing challenges, and identify the remaining patient subgroups with unmet medical needs.
