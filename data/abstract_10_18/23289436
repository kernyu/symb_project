Campylobacter are the most commonly reported bacterial causes of human gastroenteritis, and they are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics, including macrolides and fluoroquinolones, those most frequently used for the treatment of campylobacteriosis. Active efflux mechanisms are involved in resistance of Campylobacter to a broad spectrum of antimicrobials, and are also essential for Campylobacter colonization in the animal intestine, through mediation of bile resistance. Acquisition of antibiotic resistance through resistance-conferring mutations can impose a fitness cost of Campylobacter. The aim of the present study was to determine whether macrolide and fluoroquinolone resistance in Campylobacter affects their tolerance to bile salts and sodium deoxycholate through the most frequent resistance-conferring mutations. Antimicrobial efflux was studied on the basis of restored sensitivity in the presence of the efflux-pump inhibitors (EPIs) phenylalanine-arginine beta-naphthylamide (PAbetaN) and 1-(1-naphthylmethyl)-piperazine. In the 15 Campylobacter jejuni and 23 Campylobacter coli strains examined here, both of these EPIs partially reversed the resistance to bile salts and sodium deoxycholate. Erythromycin-sensitive C. coli strains were more resistant to bile salts and sodium deoxycholate than erythromycin-resistant strains. PAbetaN had greater effects on bile salt and sodium deoxycholate resistance in these erythromycin-resistant strains compared to erythromycin-sensitive strains. However, no differences were seen between the ciprofloxacin-sensitive and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains.
