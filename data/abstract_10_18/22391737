NAC (for NAM, ATAF1, 2, and CUC2) family genes encode plant-specific transcription factors that play important roles in plant development regulation and in abiotic and biotic stresses. However, the function of NAC genes in grapevines is not clear. A novel NAC transcription factor, designated as VpNAC1, was isolated from Chinese wild Vitis pseudoreticulata. It belongs to the TERN subgroup and is a nuclear-targeting protein and functions as a transcriptional activator. Moreover, VpNAC1 was induced by the fungus Erysiphe necator and the exogenous hormones, particularly salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate and ethylene. Over-expression of VpNAC1 in tobacco plants enhanced their resistance to Erysiphe cichoracearum and Phytophthora parasitica var. nicotianae Tucker. These results suggest that VpNAC1 acts as a positive regulator in biotic stresses.
