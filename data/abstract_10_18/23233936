Influenza viruses are highly contagious for human population and result in acute respiratory infectious diseases ranging from mild to severe. Neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (NAIs) (oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir and laninamivir), which target the NA glycoproteins of influenza A and B viruses are widely used in the prophylaxis and treatment of influenza virus infection. However, the substitutions of amino acids in NA or HA gene may lead to resistances to NAIs. NAI-resistance-related substitutions are typically specific to certain NA type or subtype. The sensitivity for NAI-resistance detection is affected by different assays used.
