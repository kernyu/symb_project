The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between the concentration of Pluronic P123/F127 block copolymers and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitory potency. Modulation of multidrug resistance (MDR) by Pluronic P123/F127 was evaluated in P-gp over-expressing human breast cancer cell line MCF-7/ADR and its non-P-gp over-expressing counterpart MCF-7 cells. Four different probes (known as P-gp substrates) including rhodamine 123 (R-123), rhodamine 6G (R-6G), doxorubicin (DOX), and paclitaxel (PTX) were applied to investigate the impact of Pluronic P123/F127 copolymers with different concentrations on the intracellular accumulation of these probes. Additionally, the intracellular ATP and mitochondrial transmembrane potential in MCF-7/ADR cells were determined over a wide concentration range of Pluronic P123/F127. Furthermore, the endocytic mechanisms of Pluronic micelles were performed. It was suggested that P-gp substrate hydrophobicity and the concentration of P123/F127 copolymers had little impact on P-gp inhibitory activity of Pluronic P123/F127 itself. Intracellular ATP depletion was the main mechanism of Pluronic P123/F127 for P-gp inhibition. In vitro cytotoxicity study was also conducted in order to compare cytotoxic effect among different PTX formulations. It indicated that the IC50 of PTX-loaded Pluronic P123/F127 mixed micelles was 6.3-fold lower than free PTX and 2.3-fold lower than Taxol, respectively. Therefore, Pluronic P123/F127 polymeric micelles could be considered a promising drug delivery system to overcome MDR in cancer therapy.
