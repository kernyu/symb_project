Patients with cancer or hematologic diseases are particularly at risk of infection leading to high morbidity, mortality and costs. Extensive data show that optimization of the administration of antimicrobials according to their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters improves clinical outcome. Evidence is growing that when pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters are used to target not only clinical cure but also eradication, the selection resistance is also contained. This is of particular importance in patients with neutropenia in whom increasing rates of drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria have been reported, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Based on experimental and clinical studies, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters are discussed in this review for each antibiotic used in febrile neutropenia in order to help physicians improve dosing and optimization of antimicrobial agents.
