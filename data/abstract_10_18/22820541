BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection increases the risk of poor outcomes in active tuberculosis. We updated a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the effects of duration of rifamycins, schedule of dosing, and antiretroviral therapy (ART) on failure, relapse, death during treatment, and acquired drug resistance (ADR) in patients with HIV and active tuberculosis. METHODS: We searched for randomized control trials (RCTs) and observational studies published between January 2008 and November 2011. We pooled risk differences (RD) from RCTs comparing rifampin for >/=9 months and 6 months. Within strata of the 3 treatment covariates, we calculated pooled risks and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) using outcomes from RCTs and observational studies. RESULTS: After screening 2293 citations, 7 studies were added in the update. Risk of relapse was lowered with rifampin treatment for >/=9 months compared with 6 months (pooled RD = -9.1%; 95% CI, -16.5, -1.8). Odds of relapse were higher with shorter durations of rifamycins (aOR 2 vs >/=8 months = 5.0 [1.9, 13.2]; 6 vs >/=8 months = 2.4 [1.2, 5.0]) and in the absence of ART (aOR = 14.3, [2.1, 97.8]). Post hoc meta-regression restricted to arms with ART demonstrated no associations between rifamycin duration, dosing schedule, and outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with HIV and active tuberculosis, ART reduces the risk of TB relapse. Use of rifamycins for >/=8 months and daily dosing in the intensive phase also improve TB treatment outcomes; however, a paucity of evidence makes their importance less clear for patients on ART. There is an urgent need to increase the number of coinfected patients receiving ART.
