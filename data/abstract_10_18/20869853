The objectives of this study were to compare the incidence of nosocomial infections (NIs) and the distribution of resistant nosocomial pathogens in adult Intensive Care Units (ICUs) and two respiratory care facilities for prolonged mechanically ventilated patients [i.e. the respiratory care centre (RCC) and the respiratory care ward (RCW)] in a 1100-bed tertiary care hospital in Taiwan from 2003 to 2006. The overall incidences of NI for adult ICUs, the RCC and the RCW were 14.0, 10.3 and 5.0 per 1000 patient-days, respectively. Urinary tract infections, bloodstream infections and pneumonias occurred most frequently. The most common reported microorganisms in adult ICUs were non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli (NFGNB) (33.0%), Enterobacteriaceae (26.5%), Candida spp. (18.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (8.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (4.9%) and enterococci (4.5%). In comparison, RCW patients had a higher proportion of NIs caused by S. aureus [odds ratio (OR)=1.9], enterococci (OR=2.2) and Enterobacteriaceae (OR=2.2), but a lower proportion of CoNS (OR=0.3), NFGNB (OR=0.5) and Candida spp. (OR=0.2). RCW patients had higher incidence rates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (OR=4.91) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (OR=4.06) than ICU patients. Further study is needed to delineate the mechanisms responsible for the differences in resistance profile amongst pathogens associated with nosocomial infection in ICUs, RCCs and RCWs.
