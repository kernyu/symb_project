OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to assess the presence of mcr-1 in Shigella sonnei isolated in Vietnam. METHODS: WGS data were analysed for the presence of the mcr-1 gene sequence. The association of mcr-1 with a plasmid was assessed by PCR and by conjugation. RESULTS: Through genome sequencing we identified a plasmid-associated inactive form of mcr-1 in a 2008 Vietnamese isolate of Shigella sonnei. The plasmid was conjugated into Escherichia coli and mcr-1 was activated upon exposure to colistin, resulting in highly colistin-resistant transconjugants. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first description of the mcr-1 gene in Shigella, which is atypical given that colistin is not ordinarily used to treat diarrhoea. Our data suggest the mcr-1 gene has been circulating in human-restricted pathogens for some time but likely carries a selective fitness cost.
