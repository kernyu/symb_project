OBJECTIVE: To explore the mechanism governing the reversal of multidrug resistance in human breast carcinoma cells by chelerythrine. METHODS: Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot were used to determine the expressions of protein kinase Calpha (PKCalpha) and multidrug resistance-related genes ABCG2, ABCC1, MDR1, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in MCF-7Taxol cells after treatment with chelerythrine and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA). Also, the antitumor effect of PMA or chelerythrine and effects of PKCalpha activator or inhibitor in combination with paclitaxel or adriamycin on multidrug resistance in MCF-7Taxol cells were evaluated by MTT. RESULTS: RT-PCR or Western blot showed that the expressions of MDR1 and P-gp were significantly higher in MCF-7Taxol cells exposed to PMA stimuli (both P0.05). CONCLUSION: PKCalpha inhibitor chelerythrine can reverse multidrug resistance in breast carcinoma cells by inhibiting the expressions of MDR1 and P-gp expression in vitro.
