Photodynamic therapy (PDT), utilizing photosensitizers and light, has received considerable interests for its potential to treat microbial infections. The advantages of antimicrobial PDT include a broad spectrum of action, efficient killing against wild-type as well as drug-resistant pathogens. Therefore, antimicrobial PDT could be valuable to rapidly reduce the microbial burden during the management of local infections, especially for the antibiotic resistance. A variety of photosensitizers have been examined its efficacy against pathogens. To increase the efficacy of photosensitizers, various drug delivery systems have been developed. Among these carrier systems, liposomes showed their PDT efficacy and safety in delivering photosensitizers. This review is focused on the application of liposomes mediated photodynamic inactivation of bacteria along with the discussion of few of recent patents.
