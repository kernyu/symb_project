OBJECTIVES: To describe the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among commensal Escherichia coli isolates on household and small-scale chicken farms, common in southern Vietnam, and to investigate the association of antimicrobial resistance with farming practices and antimicrobial usage. METHODS: We collected data on farming and antimicrobial usage from 208 chicken farms. E. coli was isolated from boot swab samples using MacConkey agar (MA) and MA with ceftazidime, nalidixic acid or gentamicin. Isolates were tested for their susceptibility to 11 antimicrobials and for ESBL production. Risk factor analyses were carried out, using logistic regression, at both the bacterial population and farm levels. RESULTS: E. coli resistant to gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and third-generation cephalosporins was detected on 201 (96.6%), 191 (91.8%) and 77 (37.0%) of the farms, respectively. Of the 895 E. coli isolates, resistance to gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and third-generation cephalosporins was detected in 178 (19.9%), 291 (32.5%) and 29 (3.2%) of the isolates, respectively. Ciprofloxacin resistance was significantly associated with quinolone usage (OR = 2.26) and tetracycline usage (OR = 1.70). ESBL-producing E. coli were associated with farms containing fish ponds (OR = 4.82). CONCLUSIONS: Household and small farms showed frequent antimicrobial usage associated with a high prevalence of resistance to the most commonly used antimicrobials. Given the weak biocontainment, the high prevalence of resistant E. coli could represent a risk to the environment and to humans.
