Cold atmospheric plasma science is an innovative upcoming technology for the medical sector. The plasma composition and subsequent effects on cells, tissues and pathogens can vary enormously depending on the plasma source, the plasma settings and the ambient conditions. Cold atmospheric plasmas consist of a highly reactive mix of ions and electrons, reactive molecules, excited species, electric fields and to some extent also UV radiation. In the last year, this partly ionized gas has been demonstrated to have a broad antimicrobial activity, while resistance and resistance development are unlikely. Furthermore, recent research has indicated that plasmas also have a strong influence on various cell lines and cell functions, including anticancer properties. This review summarizes the major plasma designs available and their main benefits, as well as assessing possible risks of this new technology.
