PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this study is to explore the latest developments in the risk factors, prevention and treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in immunocompromised children, including those with congenital immunodeficiency or iatrogenic immune suppression related to solid organ transplantation (SOT) or haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). RECENT FINDINGS: CMV viral load measurements now have international standards, allowing for more reliable comparison across sites and within individuals. Preemptive and prophylactic therapy with routine CMV monitoring in transplant patients has yielded significant reduction in CMV morbidity and mortality in these patients. The majority of U.S. states have adopted routine newborn screening for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Viral infections, including CMV, are a major obstacle preventing optimal curative transplantation in these patients. Several new antiviral agents are currently being investigated for CMV infection in immunocompromised patients. Knowledge on CMV drug resistance in children is emerging and requires further study. SUMMARY: Conditions that diminish cell-mediated immunity impact the development of CMV infection and disease. These conditions include certain congenital immunodeficiencies and SOT and HCT. Infants identified as having SCID should be screened for CMV risk factors. A preemptive or prophylactic strategy should be chosen for CMV management in children who are high risk posttransplantation. In those who develop disease, viral loads should be monitored and resistance testing considered if response is not deemed adequate. Oral valganciclovir is being used as an alternative to ganciclovir in children, although pharmacokinetic data are limited. Other oral antiviral agents under development are promising future options for paediatric CMV therapy.
