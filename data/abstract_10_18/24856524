Survival has improved in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), in part because of aggressive antimicrobial management. Two multidrug-resistant environmental bacteria, the Burkholderia cepacia group and nontuberculous mycobacteria, have emerged. Improving genomic and proteomic technologies are allowing better identification of bacteria and fungi found in the CF lung and detection of viral agents that may be associated with pulmonary exacerbations. Anaerobic bacteria and Streptococcus angionsus group organisms may play a role in chronic CF lung infections. The diversity of organisms declines perhaps as a result of aggressive antimicrobial therapy, and an apex predator, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, may emerge in many patients with CF.
