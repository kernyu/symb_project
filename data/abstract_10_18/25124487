UNLABELLED: Antibiotics overuse is linked to elevated antimicrobial resistance. In Aragon, Spain, the highest antibiotic prescription rates occur among children from 1 to 4 years old. The rate of use in this age group is over 60%. AIM: To evaluate the effect of multi-faceted intervention on Primary Care paediatricians to reduce antibiotic use and to improve antibiotic prescribing for paediatric outpatients. METHODS: Outpatient antimicrobial prescribing was analysed before and after an intervention in paediatricians. The intervention included a clinical education session about diagnosis and treatment in the most prevalent paediatric infectious diseases, a clinical interview and communication skills, a workshop on rapid Streptococcus antigen detection test and patient information leaflets and useful internet websites for parents. The control group included paediatricians without this educational intervention on antibiotics. RESULTS: Antibiotic prescribing decreased from 19.17 defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants/day (DID) to 14.36 DID among intervention paediatricians vs 19.84 DID to 16.02 DID in controls. The decreasing was higher in the intervention group, but the effect was not statistically significant. Macrolides and broad-spectrum penicillins prescribing decreased in both groups. CONCLUSION: Antibiotic prescribing decreased, but there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups. The high satisfaction of paediatricians in the intervention group makes it necessary to continue with these kinds of strategies to improve antibiotic use in outpatients.
