We analyzed the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) types of 143 fusidic acid- and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates. The most frequent SCCmec type was SCCmec III/SCCHg (53%), followed by SCCmec IV (29%). Clonal spreading of SCCmec III/SCCHg strains contributed to the increased prevalence of SCCmec III. A novel non-mec SCC structure, SCC7684, adjacent to SCCmec III, which carries a new ccrC allotype (ccrC3 allele 1) and contains heavy metal resistance genes, was identified in 14 isolates.
