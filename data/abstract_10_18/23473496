Due to their role in cellular energetics and metabolism, skeletal muscle mitochondria appear to play a key role in the development of insulin resistance and type II diabetes. High-fat diet can induce higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), evidenced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) emission from mitochondria, which may be causal for insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. The underlying mechanisms are unclear. Recent published data on single substrate (pyruvate, succinate, fat) metabolism in both normal diet (CON) and high-fat diet (HFD) states of skeletal muscle allowed us to develop an integrated mathematical model of skeletal muscle mitochondrial metabolism. Model simulations suggested that long-term HFD may affect specific metabolic reaction/pathways by altering enzyme activities. Our model allows us to predict oxygen consumption and ROS generation for any combination of substrates. In particular, we predict a synergy between (iso-membrane potential) combinations of pyruvate and fat in ROS production compared to the sum of ROS production with each substrate singly in both CON and HFD states. This synergy is blunted in the HFD state.
