The artemisinin (ART), discovered in China, has been widely used against malaria in China over the last 30 years. Understanding the emergence and origin of ART resistance in China is therefore of great interest. We analyzed 111 culture-adapted isolates of P. falciparum from China-Myanmar (CM) border for their susceptibility to dihydroartemisinin using the ring stage survival assay (RSA0-3h) and genotyped their K13 genes. Of the isolates, 59 had a wild type of the K13 marker and a median ring survival rate of 0.26% (P95 = 1.005%). Among the remaining isolates harboring single mutations in the K13 marker, 26 survived at >P95(median survival rate = 2.95%). Further, we genotyped the K13 gene of 693 isolates collected from different regions in China and China-Myanmar/Thai-Cambodia/Thai-Myanmar (CM/TC/TM) borders, 308 (44.4%) had K13 mutations and marked differences in the patterns of K13 mutations were observed between the CM and the TC/TM borders. A network diagram showed that majority of the K13 mutant alleles from the CM border clustered together including those harboring the high resistant-associated R539T mutations. The resistant parasites carrying distinct halplotypes suggested the multiple indigenous origins of the resistant alleles, which highlight the importance of surveillance of resistance in all malaria endemic areas where ART has been introduced.
