I-type lysozyme is considered to play crucial roles in both anti-bacteria and digestion function of the bivalve, which signifies that it is related to both immunity and growth. In this study, based on the principle of case-control association analysis, using the stock materials with different vibrio-resistance profile obtained by selective breeding, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the DNA partial sequence of an i-type lysozyme of Meretrix meretrix (MmeLys) were discovered and examined for their association with vibrio-resistance and growth. Twenty-seven SNPs were detected and fifteen of them were genotyped in clam stocks with different resistance to Vibrio harveyi (09-C and 09-R) and to Vibrio parahaemolyticus (11-S and 11-R). Allele frequency distribution among different stocks was compared. And wet weight of clams with different genotype at each SNP locus was compared. The results indicated that SNP locus 9 was associated with V. harveyi and V. parahaemolyticus resistance and growth of M. meretrix. Loci 12 and 14 were associated with both V. parahaemolyticus-resistance and growth, and also have the potential to be related with V. harveyi-resistance of M. meretrix. Therefore these three SNPs especially locus 9 were the potential markers which may be involved in assisting resistance selective breeding. In addition, this study showed evidence that improvements in clam resistance to vibriosis could be achieved through selective breeding. All results provided encouragement for the continuation of the selective breeding program for vibrio-resistance gain in clam M. meretrix and the application of polymorphisms in MmeLys to the future marker assisted selection.
