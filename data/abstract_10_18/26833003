OBJECTIVE: To study the condition of HIV-1 drug resistance mutation among failures of first-line antiretroviral therapy in Henan province. METHOD: The sub platform of China's legal infectious disease monitoring information reporting system-HIV/AIDS integrated prevention and control data information management system was used to collect the information of patients experiencing first-line antiretroviral treatment failure (virus load >/= 1 000 copies/ml) more than one year among nine cities of Henan in 2011. A total of 40 cases with no information and 212 cases with incomplete drug resistance results were deleted, and 1 922 cases were included in this study and genotype resistance testing was carried out. Non-conditional logistic regression analysis was used to analyse the influencing factors of drug resistance mutation. RESULTS: A total of 1 922 cases were included in the analysis. 1 039 cases were males, 833 cases were females, the age was (45.7 +/- 12.1) years, 82.73% (1 590) were married, and 87.93% (1 690) were transmitted by blood. 64.20% (1 234) patients acquired drug resistance. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) and protease inhibitor (PI) resistance mutations were found in 62.59% (1 203), 49.74% (956) and 0.94% (18) of subjects, respectively. 42.09% (809) of patients harbored NRTI and NNRTI resistance mutations synchronously. >/= 1TAM was the most commonly emerged NRTI resistance mutation (41.94% (806)), the prevalences of TAM-1 and TAM-2 were 8.48% (163) and 4.24% (81), respectively. K65R/N and Q151M complex existed in 23 and 4 patients, respectively. K103N/S was the most commonly emerged NNRTI resistance mutation (34.32% (659)). Non-conditional logistic regression analysis showed that, factors associated with high drug resistance were the following: transmitted by mother to child (OR = 9.05, 95% CI: 1.14-72.12), clinical stage was IV (OR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.09-2.66) and 5-year-treated (OR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.03-2.47). Factors associated with low drug resistance were the following: 1-year-treated (OR = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.13-0.27). CONCLUSION: Complex patterns of HIV-1 drug resistance mutations were identified among individuals experiencing failure of first-line antiretroviral therapy in Henan province. Factors associated with high drug resistance were lived in Luohe, Shangqiu, Nanyang, Xinyang, transmitted by mother to child, clinical stage was IV, and 5-year-treated.
