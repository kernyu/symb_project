Dermatologists frequently create cutaneous defects that heal by second intention, yet there is no universal protocol for wound care in this setting. Several ointments commonly used for wound healing are not cost effective as they contain known contact allergens, contribute to antimicrobial resistance, and do not enhance the healing process. Recent studies indicate that Bensal HP, a commercially available ointment used for a variety of dermatologic conditions, may be useful for wound healing; although clinical data is currently limited. In this single-center open-label pilot study, Bensal HP was evaluated for second intention healing over 8 weeks following either Mohs micrographic surgery or shave skin biopsy in 20 patients. Results indicate that Bensal HP is effective for second intention healing as demonstrated by increased Global Assessment of Efficacy scores and decreased wound measurements, with 16 patients achieving full closure. Patient symptoms overall improved over the study period, and Bensal HP was well tolerated with no adverse effects associated with its use. By providing critical data regarding the safety and efficacy of Bensal HP, this study may provide useful information to guide further assessment in future large-scale comparative wound healing studies. <br /><br /> <em>J Drugs Dermatol.</em> 2016;15(10):1197-1202.
