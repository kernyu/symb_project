Effects of nisin and lysozyme on growth inhibition and biofilm formation capacity of 25 Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from raw milk (13 strains) and cheese (12 strains) were studied. Nisin was tested at concentrations between 0.5 and 25 mug/ml; the growth of all strains was inhibited at 25 mug/ml, but the resistances of strains showed a great variation at lower nisin concentrations. In contrast, lysozyme tested at concentrations up to 5.0 mg/ml showed no inhibition on the growth of strains. Nisin used at the growth inhibitory concentration prevented the biofilm formation of strains, but strains continued biofilm formation at subinhibitory nisin concentrations. Lysozyme did not affect the biofilm formation of 19 of the strains, but it caused a considerable activation in the biofilm formation capacity of six strains. Twelve of the strains contained both biofilm-related protease genes (sspA, sspB, and aur) and active proteases; eight of these strains were nisin resistant. These results suggest a potential risk of S. aureus growth and biofilm formation when lysozyme is used in the biopreservation of dairy products. Nisin can be used to control growth and biofilm formation of foodborne S. aureus, unless resistance against this biopreservative develops.
