The in vitro activity of azithromycin against 1,237 nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica isolates collected from Finnish patients between 2003 and 2008 was investigated. Only 24 (1.9%) of the isolates tested and 15 (5.1%) of the 294 isolates with reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility had azithromycin MICs of >or=32 microg/ml. These data show that azithromycin has good in vitro activity against nontyphoidal S. enterica, and thus, it may be a good candidate for clinical treatment studies of salmonellosis.
