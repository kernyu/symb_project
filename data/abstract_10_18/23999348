PURPOSE: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a significant cause of burn wound infections and, skin and soft tissue infections. The antiseptic management is an integral part of the management of wound infections and is essential to control wound infection. Although commonly used, concerns have been raised. RESULTS: Available experimental data suggest that many commonly used antiseptic agents may be toxic to the cells involved in wound healing process and may affect the process of normal tissue repair. In view of this, the present review summarized the various organic acids commonly used as a substitute for antiseptics to control pseudomonal wound infections with special reference to acetic acid and their role in the process of wound healing. CONCLUSION: Acetic acid is to be kept in mind as one of the alternatives when infection is caused by multiple antibiotic resistant strains of P. aeruginosa. At a time when bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a matter of increasing concern, the value of topical agents such as acetic acid should not be forgotten.
