Contaminated environmental surfaces are important reservoirs in the transmission of many human pathogens. Although several options exist for disinfecting contaminated environmental surfaces, few are compatible with use on both hard smooth non-porous (hard) and soft porous surfaces (soft) while still offering significant disinfection of the contaminating organisms. This study evaluated the efficacy of mist application of a stabilized chlorine dioxide and quaternary ammonium compound-based disinfectant (Cryocide20) for inactivation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) on various environmental surfaces. MRSA and VRE were applied to hard and soft surfaces (glass, steel, tile, carpet, and cotton fabric), allowed to dry, and exposed to a uniform mist application of the disinfectant solution. After 1 hr of contact time, the residual disinfectant was neutralized, and the bacteria were recovered and enumerated on brain heart infusion (BHI) agar. Reduction of both test bacteria was observed on most of the hard and soft surfaces tested. Log(10) reduction of the organisms tended to be higher on steel, tile, and carpet than glass or cotton. Overall, these results suggest that mist application of Cryocide20 disinfectant may be an effective option for reduction of low levels of infectious bacterial pathogens from contaminated environmental surfaces.
