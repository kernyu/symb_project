Bacterial infections have been a major challenge to health studies, facing the increasingly resistance to antimicrobial agents, which according to World Health Organization, could be the major death cause until 2050. Photodynamic therapy emerges as an alternative in microbial inactivation, due to its selectivity and to decreasing or dismissing the antibiotic use. This study aimed at evaluating, in vitro, the internalization of the Methylene Blue and its photodynamic activity against a clinical and ATCC strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphyloccocus aureus. Thus, the strains were incubated with MB in concentrations of 100, 300 e 500mug/mL and then irradiated with a LED (+/-660nm) at fluency of 10 and 25J/cm(2). The MB internalization was evaluated using a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 700), to capture the MB and the DAPI (for DNA staining). It was possible to observe that the MB was internalized by the bacterial cells, in all concentrations tested. The CFU/ml count demonstrated significant reduction (p</=0,01) at the average 5.0 logs comparing with control group for the two species in all the tested concentrations. In conclusion, the strains tested were capable of internalizing the MB. The PDT with the MB were able to decrease the growth of the tested strains in vitro, being a promising alternative to the future treatment of infections caused by these species.
