Treatment strategies in paediatric patients have to face with specific challenges associated with selection of a successful antiretroviral drug regimen, long-lasting maintenance of adherence to therapy, short and long-term drug-related toxicities and emerging of extensive drug resistance. This review shows an up-to-date picture of the ultimate advances of antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected children.
