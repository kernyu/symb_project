Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is responsible for difficult-to-treat and relapsing infections and constitutes one of the most problematic pathogens due to its multiple resistances to clinically available antibiotics. Additionally, the ability of S. aureus to develop small-colony variants is associated with a reduced susceptibility to aminoglycoside antibiotics and in vivo persistence. We have recently demonstrated that tomatidine, a steroid alkaloid isolated from tomato plants, possesses anti-virulence activity against normal strains of S. aureus as well as the ability to potentiate the effect of aminoglycoside antibiotics. In addition, tomatidine has shown antibiotic activity against small-colony variants of S. aureus. We herein report the first study of the structure-activity relationship of tomatidine against S. aureus.
