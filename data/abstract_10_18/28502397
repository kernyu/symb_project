The Check-MDR CT103XL beta-lactamase assay was validated for use in the clinical microbiology laboratory using two CDC-FDA Antimicrobial Resistant Isolate Bank panels (133 gram-negative bacilli known beta-lactamase genes). The CT103XL detected most reported resistance genes (123 of 136 genes) and additionally identified several resistance genes not reported by the CDC. Discrepant results were confirmed via whole genome sequencing.
