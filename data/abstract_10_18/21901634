From 1994 to 2009, the incidence of invasive serotype 19A pneumococci isolated from adults in Barcelona and San Sebastian almost doubled every 4 years. Genotyping of the 167 invasive isolates studied showed serotype 19A to be highly heterogeneous, with 35 different sequence types (STs) and a different clonal structure in each region and time period. Multiresistance, defined as non-susceptibility to three or more antimicrobials, was found in 86 (51.5%) isolates. The most frequent ST was the multidrug-resistant ST276 (n = 28), which is a single-locus variant of the Denmark(14)-ST230 global clone. The ST276 clone, only present in San Sebastian before 2001, was successfully disseminated from 2002 in both cities and was the main contributor to the overall increase of serotype 19A infections.
