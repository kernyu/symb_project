BACKGROUND: Acinetobacter baumannii has been associated with high morbidity and mortality rates, even in pediatric patients. Therapeutic options are limited, especially when the strain is multidrug resistant. METHODS: Clinical and microbiological analyses of 4 cases of systemic infections caused by multi drug resistant A. baumannii treated with colistin/vancomycin combination at a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit were performed in order to explore the potential synergistic activity of colistin plus vancomycin. All the patients were treated with colistin, meropenem and vancomycin. RESULTS: Four severe infections due to MDR A. baumannii were observed. All patients treated with colistin/vancomycin combination had a positive outcome with no infection relapses. Most importantly, no significant adverse events related to the simultaneous administration of COL plus VAN were observed. In our in-vitro experiments, the synergistic effect of the combination COL plus VAN showed an early bactericidal activity even at VAN concentration of 16 mg/L, which reflects the serum trough concentrations obtained in patients. DISCUSSION: An antimicrobial strategy based on the activity of colistin plus vancomycin was in-vitro and in-vivo effective in life-threatening infections caused by multidrug-resistant A. baumannii in a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, in the absence of adverse effects. Colistin plus vancomycin were highly synergic and bactericidal against carbapenem-resistant, colistin sensitive A. baumannii whereas the addition of meropenem did not enhance the in-vitro activity of colistin plus vancomycin. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm existing data on the potential synergistic activity of a therapeutic strategy including colistin plus vancomycin and provide important new clinical information for its potential use as a therapeutic option against MDR A. baumannii infections, especially in the pediatric population.
