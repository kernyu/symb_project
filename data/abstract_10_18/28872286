This paper is the fifth part of the series concerning the search for new preparations for antibacterial therapy and discussing new compounds belonging to the oxazolidinone class of antibacterial chemotherapeutics. This article presents five new substances that are currently at the stage of clinical trials (radezolid, sutezolid, posizolid, LCB01-0371 and MRX-I). The intensive search for new antibiotics and antibacterial chemotherapeutics with effective antibacterial activity is aimed at overcoming the existing resistance mechanisms in order to effectively fight against multidrug-resistant bacteria, which pose a real threat to public health. The crisis of antibiotic resistance can be overcome by the proper use of these drugs, based on bacteriological and pharmacological knowledge. Oxazolidinones, with their unique mechanism of action and favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters, represent an alternative way to effectively treat serious infections caused by Gram-positive microorganisms.
