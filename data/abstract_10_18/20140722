Three Lactobacillus strains (LOCK 0900, LOCK 0908, LOCK 0919) out of twenty-four isolates were selected according to their antagonistic activity against pathogenic bacteria, resistance to low pH and milieu of bile salts. Intragastric administration of a mixture of these strains to Balb/c mice affected cytokine T(H)1-T(H)2 balance toward nonallergic T(H)1 response. Spleen cells, isolated from lactobacilli-treated mice and re-stimulated in vitro with the mixture of heat-inactivated tested strains, produced significantly higher amounts of anti-allergic tumor necrosis factor- and interferon-gamma than control animals whereas the level of pro-allergic interleukin-5 was significantly lower. Lactobacillus cells did not translocate through the intestinal barrier into blood, liver and spleen; a few Lactobacillus cells found in mesenteric lymph nodes could create antigenic reservoir activating the immune system. The mixture of Lactobacillus LOCK 0900, LOCK 0908 and LOCK 0919 strains represents a probiotic bacterial preparation with possible use in prophylaxis and/or therapy of allergic diseases.
