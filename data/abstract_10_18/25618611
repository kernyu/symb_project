OBJECTIVES: (a) Compare utilization of vancomycin in the ED prior to and after implementation of standardized treatment guideline and order template (STGOT); (b) assess the appropriate use as initial therapy based on indication versus admitting diagnosis. METHODS: Chart audits on all patients who received vancomycin and were admitted. Overall utilization and appropriateness of starting therapy were compared pre-and post-STGOT implementation. RESULTS: Overall utilization of vancomycin was 4% pre-STGOT compared to 3% post-STGOT; 98% of patients pre-STGOT compared to 99% post-STGOT received vancomycin appropriately. CONCLUSION: There was no difference in vancomycin utilization and appropriateness of initiating therapy after STGOT implementation.
