OBJECTIVES: Macrolides, such as azithromycin and erythromycin, are the first line drug for (prophylactic) treatment of pertussis. This study was aimed to screen for macrolide, quinolone, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistant strains among Finnish Bordetella pertussis isolates. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on 148 B. pertussis strains isolated during 2006-2017. Isolates were analysed with the allele-specific PCR for detection of macrolide resistance associated mutation A2047G in the 23S rRNA gene. The gyrA gene was sequenced for detection of the A260G mutation associated with quinolone resistance. For phenotyping, a random selection was made by selecting every third isolate (N=50) for testing by the minimum inhibitory concentration method for erythromycin and azithromycin (E-test, bioMerieux) and by single disk diffusion (inhibition zone size) of quinolone nalidixic acid (NAL, OXOID, United Kingdom), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX, OXOID, United Kingdom). RESULTS: Neither the macrolide resistance associated mutation A2047G nor the quinolone resistance associated mutation A260G were detected in any of the isolates. Minimum inhibitory concentration of azithromycin and erythromycin ranged between 0.016 and 0.19mug/ml and 0.016 and 0.25mug/ml respectively. The size of the inhibition zone surrounding the nalidixic acid disk ranged between 22 and 27mm in diameter. The inhibition zone surrounding the TMP/SMX disk ranged between 24 and 37mm in diameter. Isolates resistant to any of the tested antibiotics were not identified. CONCLUSIONS: The allele specific PCR is a simple and useful tool for screening of B. pertussis resistance to macrolides. All Finnish isolates tested were sensitive to macrolide, quinolone and TMP/SMX.
