The increase of antibiotic resistance amongst Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains has become one of the most pressing problems of modern medicine. Therefore, the search of antibiotics against M. tuberculosis with novel mechanisms of action is very important. We have identified inhibitors of M. tuberculosis leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) among the derivatives of 5-phenylamino-2H-[1,2,4]triazin-3-one. The most active compounds 5-(5-chloro-2-hydroxy-phenylamino)-6-methyl-2H-[1,2,4]triazin-3-one and 5-(5-chloro-2-hydroxy-phenylamino)-2H-[1,2,4]triazin-3-one inhibit M. tuberculosis LeuRS with IC50 of 7.6 mucapital EM, Cyrillic and 7.2 mucapital EM, Cyrillic, respectively. It was established that the inhibitory activity of compounds against pathogenic LeuRS is 10-fold better, than for human enzyme.
