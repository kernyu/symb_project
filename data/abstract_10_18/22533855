The objective of this study was to validate the use of pftetQ and pfmdt genes as molecular markers of decreased in vitro susceptibility to doxycycline in 113 Plasmodium falciparum isolates from Dakar, Senegal. The results show that copy numbers of pftetQ and pfmdt, estimated by TaqMan real-time PCR, are not significantly associated with reduced susceptibility to doxycycline in vitro; however, the number of samples with a high doxycycline IC(50) was likely to be too low to derive statistically significant results. Thus, no definitive conclusions could be drawn. The markers should be further tested by analysing more isolates.
