Objective: To analyze the antimicrobial resistance profile in Chinese children. Methods: This was a prevalence survey. From January 1 through December 31, 2016, the isolates were collected from 10 tertiary children hospitals in China. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out by routine laboratory methods. The penicillin susceptibility of streptococcus pneumonia and Meropenem susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria were detected by E-test and disk diffusion method respectively. Antimicrobial susceptibility results were interpreted according to the criteria of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) Guideline 2016. The data of antimicrobial susceptibility testing of isolates from either the different patients (neonatal group and non-neonatal group) or various sources were analyzed by WHONET 5.6 software. Results: A total of 56 241 isolates were collected, of which 41.5% (23 328 isolates) were gram-positive organisms and 58.5% (32 886 isolates) gram-negative organisms. The five leading pathogens were Escherichia coli (7 995/56 214, 14.2%), Straphylococcus aureus (6 468/56 214, 11.5%), Streptococcus pneumonia (6 225/56 214, 11.1%), Haemophilus influenza (5 435/56 214, 9.7%) and Klebsiella pneumonia (4 523/56 214, 8.0%). The Meropenem resistance rates of Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coil, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumonia isolates were 27.4% (326/1 189) , 8.1% (29/358) , 2.0% (27/1 362) , 19.5% (34/174) , 49.7% (230/463) in neonatal group and 15.4% (512/3 327) , 4.8% (40/841) , 2.3% (151/6 564) , 13.7% (252/1 840) , and 53.4% (860/1 611) in non-neonatal group. The Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) rates of neonatal group and non-neonatal group were 46.2% (649/1 404) and 33.3% (1 668/5 010) . The penicillin non-susceptible rates of Streptococcus pneumonia in the two groups were 17.6% (6/34) and 18.2% (1 121/6 158) respectively. The beta-lactamase positive rates of Haemophilus pneumonia isolates in the neonatal group and non-neonatal groups were 33.8% (47/139) and 44.4% (2 345/5 282) respectively. Conclusion: This investigation highlights the worrisome trend of antimicrobial resistance in children, especially among neonatal patients in China.
