A panel of 16 HIV-1 isolates was designed. Those isolates were isolated from patients undergoing HAART and developing resistance to the antiretroviral drugs. It was shown that the isolates were resistant to nucleoside RT inhibitors (retrovir, epivir) and non-nucleoside inhibitors (viramun). Isolates had stable replication activity. Average rate of cells expressing viral Ag was 14-20%. The infectious titer was 2.4 Ig TCID50. The sequencing showed that all isolates were of the subtype A dominating in the major part of Russian Federation. This panel could be used as the biotechnological base for studying antiretroviral drugs of new generation and for the design of experimental vaccines.
