BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori eradication rates have tended to decrease recently, mostly due to antibiotic resistance. In the present study, our aim was to determine Hp eradication rate with the LAC plus tid metronidazole regimen and the secondary objective of this study was to identify an effective regimen for our population. METHODS: Eighty-four Hp-positive patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia were assigned into the same group. Patients were administered the classical LAC protocole (lansoprazole 30 mg bid, amoxicillin 1 g bid and claritromycin 500 mg bid for 14 days) plus metronidazole 500 mg tid for 14 days. Gastroscopy and histopathological assessment were performed before enrollment and C(14) urea breath test and stool antigen test were performed 6 weeks after treatment. RESULTS: All 84 patients completed the study. No patient left the study because of drug side effect. Total eradication rate was 75% (63/84). CONCLUSION: Although LAC plus tid metronidazole regimen achieved a much better eradication rate compared with the standard LAC regimen; this is the first study that has a relatively low success with a concomitant therapy. So in areas of high resistance like Turkey, one cannot expect a high success with any clarithromycin containing regimen and those should be avoided.
