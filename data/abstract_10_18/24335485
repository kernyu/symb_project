OBJECTIVES: Artemisinin and artemisinin semi-synthetic derivatives (collectively known as endoperoxides) are first-line antimalarials for the treatment of uncomplicated and severe malaria. Endoperoxides display very fast killing rates and are generally recalcitrant to parasite resistance development. These key pharmacodynamic features are a result of a complex mechanism of action, the details of which lack consensus. Here, we report on the primary physiological events leading to parasite death. METHODS: Parasite mitochondrial (DeltaPsim) and plasma membrane (DeltaPsip) electrochemical potentials were measured using real-time single-cell imaging following exposure to pharmacologically relevant concentrations of endoperoxides (artemisinin, dihydroartemisinin, artesunate and the synthetic tetraoxane RKA182). In addition, mitochondrial electron transport chain components NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (alternative complex I), bc1 (complex III) and cytochrome oxidase (complex IV) were investigated to determine their functional sensitivity to the various endoperoxides. RESULTS: Parasite exposure to endoperoxides resulted in rapid depolarization of parasite DeltaPsim and DeltaPsip. The rate of depolarization was decreased in the presence of a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger and Fe(3+) chelators. Depolarization of DeltaPsim by endoperoxides is not believed to be through the inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport chain components, owing to the lack of significant inhibition when assayed directly. CONCLUSIONS: The depolarization of DeltaPsim and DeltaPsip is shown to be mediated via the generation of ROS that are initiated by iron bioactivation of endoperoxides and/or catalysed by iron-dependent oxidative stress. These data are discussed in the context of current hypotheses concerning the mode of action of endoperoxides.
