We identified a ceftriaxone-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolate in a patient in Canada. This isolate carried the penA-60 allele, which differs substantially from its closest relative, mosaic penA XXVII (80% nucleotide identity). Epidemiologic and genomic data suggest spread from Asia. Antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance helps prevent spread of highly resistant N. gonorrhoeae strains.
