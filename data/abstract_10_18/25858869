Sepsis is an important cause of worldwide morbidity and mortality. Early recognition and diagnosis are keys to achieving improved outcomes. Procalcitonin has been widely investigated as a potential biomarker for sepsis. Furthermore, management of sepsis and other infectious disease is becoming increasingly complicated by the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains of pathogens. Good antibiotic governance is important in reducing the risk of the development of further antibiotic resistance. We reviewed the current literature on the use of procalcitonin in sepsis to determine whether it should be recommended for use in either of these roles. Procalcitonin should not be used as a stand-alone diagnostic test to rule-in or rule-out sepsis or bacterial infection, or for prognostication, in the absence of clinical judgment. Used as part of a clinical algorithm, however, it has been shown to reduce antibiotic prescribing in critical care environments and for respiratory tract infections.
