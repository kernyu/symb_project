Resistance of sublethally injured cells (SICs) of Escherichia coli O157:H7 induced by high pressure carbon dioxide (HPCD) to salt, low temperature, mild heat, nisin, acids and low pHs was investigated in this study. The SICs of E. coli were obtained following HPCD at 5MPa and 25 degrees C for 40-60min or 5MPa and 45 degrees C for 20min. The untreated cells could survive normally while the HPCD-treated cells showed 2.87log10cycles' reduction on tryptic soy agar (TSA) with 3% NaCl. The counts of the untreated cells were not significantly changed during 5h incubation at 4 degrees C or 40min incubation at 45 degrees C, and the HPCD-treated cells were also not affected by 5h incubation at 4 degrees C but showed 1.75log10cycles' reduction at 45 degrees C for 40min. The antimicrobial nisin caused an extra 0.25-1.0log10cycles' reduction of the HPCD-treated cells while the untreated cells was not inactivated by nisin. Except for oxalic acid (OA), citric acid (CA), malic acid (MA), tartaric acid (TA), lactic acid (LA), acetic acid (AA) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) did not inactivate the untreated cells, but all these seven acids caused a 0.74-1.53log10cycles' reduction of HPCD-treated cells. These results indicated that HPCD-induced SICs had a decreased resistance to salt, mild heat, nisin and acids. Moreover, the recovery test was used to investigate the sensitivity of the SICs to different pHs. Results showed that the SICs could not recover below or equal to pH4.0. These promising results would open up the possibility of exploring the combination of other technologies (eg. mild heat, nisin and acids) with HPCD as hurdle approaches to inactivate target pathogens in foods.
