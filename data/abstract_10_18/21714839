AIMS: To determine the effects of Mn levels in Bacillus megaterium sporulation and spores on spore resistance. METHODS AND RESULTS: Bacillus megaterium was sporulated with no added MnCl(2) and up to 1 mmol l(-1) MnCl(2). The resultant spores were purified and loosely bound Mn removed, and spore Mn levels were found to vary c. 100-fold. The Mn level had no effect on spore gamma-radiation resistance, but B. megaterium spores with elevated Mn levels had higher resistance to UVC radiation (as did Bacillus subtilis spores), wet and dry heat and H(2)O(2). However, levels of dipicolinic acid and the DNA-protective alpha/beta-type small, acid-soluble spore proteins were the same in spores with high and low Mn levels. CONCLUSIONS: Mn levels either in sporulation or in spores are important factors in determining levels of B. megaterium spore resistance to many agents, with the exception of gamma-radiation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The Mn level in sporulation is an important factor to consider when resistance properties of B. megaterium spores are examined, and will influence the UV resistance of B. subtilis spores, some of which are used as biological dosimeters.
