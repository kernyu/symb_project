INTRODUCTION: Culture is regarded as the gold standard for the detection of genital mycoplasma in clinical samples. Commercially available diagnostic kits, based on liquid broth cultures, provide interesting alternatives to conventional culture. We assessed the laboratory performances of Mycoplasma IES (IES), the Mycofast Revolution (REV) and Mycoplasma IST 2 (IST2) compared to A7 agar plates for the detection of Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis in clinical samples. METHODOLOGY: From April to July 2013, endocervical or vaginal samples were collected from sexually active women with abnormal vaginal discharge. Each specimen was tested in parallel using the three commercial kits and the A7 agar plates. RESULTS: A total of 303 samples were included in this study, 35.6% (108/303) of which were positive on A7 plates. Sensitivities for the detection of U. urealyticum of IES, REV and IST2 were 100%, 96.2% and 95.3%, respectively while those for M. hominis were of 92.8%, 92.8% and 85.7%, respectively. Specificity was 100% for the 3 methods. Concerning antimicrobial susceptibility testing, full agreement between IES and REV was documented. CONCLUSIONS: The Mycoplasma IES kit was found to be equivalent or superior compared to other commercial culture-based assays for a rapid and accurate identification of U. urealyticum and M. hominis and detection of resistance. It might be considered a cost-effective tool for detection of these organisms, particularly attractive in developing countries.
