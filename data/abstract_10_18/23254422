While reports of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) production among Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains have emerged from a number of countries worldwide, outcome data are lacking. This is the first report evaluating how KPC production in P. aeruginosa impacts the efficacy of carbapenems by using the murine thigh infection model. Our findings suggest that the impact of KPC-2 in vivo is less pronounced than would be anticipated based on the in vitro potency.
