Emerging resistance to "last-resort" polymyxin antibiotics in Gram-negative bacteria is a significant threat to public health. We identified the Acinetobacter baumannii NaxD deacetylase as a critical mediator of lipid A modification resulting in polymyxin resistance and demonstrated that naxD is regulated by the sensor kinase PmrB. This represents the first description of a specific PmrB-regulated gene contributing to polymyxin resistance in A. baumannii and highlights NaxD as a putative drug target to reverse polymyxin resistance.
