For the purpose of optimization of antibacterial treatment of urinary tract infection in 700young patients under the condition of North it was examined the responsivity of urinary tract pathogens to antibiotics in 1998-2009. The most effective group of antibiotics is revealed. The most frequent types of urinary tract pathogens are: in men - S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, S. aureus; in women with non-complicated UTI - E. coli, S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus u S. aureus; with complicated - E. coli, S. saprophyticus, S. epidermidis. The abovementioned pathogens showed the low antibiotic resistance (in vitro) to gentamicin and ofloxacin; high antibiotic resistance to cephalosporin (3rd generation) and ciprofloxacin. It is better to prescribe ofloxacin and cefotaxime for patients with complicated UTI; for women with non-complicated UTI - ofloxacin and ceftriaxone. It is necessary to consider nephrotoxicity and low compliance before prescription of gentamicin.
