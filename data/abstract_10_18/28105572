Xanthomonas translucens pv. undulosa (Xtu) causes Bacterial Leaf Streak disease in the staple food crops such as wheat and barley. The survival strategies of pathogen and host are determined by the complex interactions occurring between the host plants and the pathogenic microbes. Iron binding proteins are important in the plant-microbe interactions as they are indulged in enzyme catalysis, virulence, metabolic and transport activities. In the presented study, we have identified that ~9.8% of Xtu proteome possess iron binding sequence motifs. Further, the analysis of Xtu proteome for secretory iron binding virulent proteins (IBVPs) revealed the fact that iron co-regulate the function of secretory proteins in virulence. We have found 26 secretory IBVPs and observed that these proteins are diverse in their biological functions ranging from transport to antimicrobial resistance, Reactive oxygen species detoxification and carbohydrate catabolism. The inferences may instigate to design the new strategies to combat and control the microbial diseases of staple food crops.
