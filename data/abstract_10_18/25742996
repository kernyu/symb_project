The in vitro activity of ravuconazole (RVCZ) was compared with those of itraconazole (ITCZ) and terbinafine (TBF) against 73 dermatophyte isolates and 18 Candida spp. isolates recovered from patients with dermatomycosis at 4 dermatological clinics in Japan in 2011. The dermatophyte isolates consisted of Trichophyton rubrum (n=51), Trichophyton mentagrophytes (n=20 : these strains were not identified by molecular phylogenetic analysis.), Trichophyton tonsurans (n=1), and Microsporum canis (n=1). The Candida spp. isolates comprised C. albicans (n=11), C. parapsilosis (n=5), C. guilliermondii (n=1), and C. pseudohaemulonii (n=1). RVCZ was highly active against all dermatophytes and all Candida spp. : the geometric mean (GM) MICs for T. rubrum and T. mentagrophytes were 0.035 mug/mL and MICs for T. tonsurans and M. canis were </= 0.03 mug/mL, and GM MICs for C. albicans and C. parapsilosis were </= 0.03 mug/mL and MICs for C. guilliermondii and C. pseudohaemulonii were 0.25 and </= 0.03 mug/mL, respectively. Compared to RVCZ, ITCZ showed similar anti-dermatophytic and anti-Candida activities, while TBF had a slightly higher anti-dermatophytic but a markedly lower anti-Candida activity. These results suggest that RVCZ is a potential candidate systemic antifungal therapy against onychomycosis and other dermatomycoses that are refractory to topical antifungal therapy.
