Streptococcus pyogenes is a notorious human pathogen responsible for a wide array of infections. The ability of S. pyogenes to form biofilms is an innate property during the pathogenesis of invasive infections. From the eleven M serotypes tested: M56, M74, M100, M65, M89 and st38 formed dense biofilms in 48 h. The present study is the first of its kind to report about the biofilm formation in the serotypes M56, M65 M74 M100 and st38. XTT reduction assay of the biofilms showed decreased metabolic activity with increase in incubation time. The surface architecture of the biofilms when observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed the microcolony formation. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to compare the surface topography and thickness of biofilms between the biofilm formers with and without the addition of glucose. Interestingly a non-biofilm former (st2147) was induced to form biofilms with the addition of glucose. On correlating the drug (erythromycin) resistance of the various M serotypes with their biofilm forming ability we noticed that erythromycin sensitive strains were found to be good biofilm formers. We also noticed that biofilm formation in S. pyogenes is independent of sil gene.
