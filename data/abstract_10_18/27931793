The proliferation of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens has been exacerbated by a lack of novel agents in current development by pharmaceutical companies. Ceftolozane/tazobactam was recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections and complicated urinary tract infections. In the present study, the activity of ceftolozane/tazobactam against four isogenic Escherichia coli strains was investigated in a hollow-fibre infection model simulating various clinical dosing regimens. The four investigational E. coli strains included #2805 (no beta-lactamase), #2890 (AmpC beta-lactamase), #2842 (CMY-10 beta-lactamase) and #2807 (CTX-M-15 beta-lactamase). Each strain was exposed to regimens simulating 1 g ceftolozane, 2 g ceftolozane, 1 g ceftolozane/0.5 g tazobactam, and 2 g ceftolozane/1 g tazobactam utilising a starting inoculum of ca. 10(6) CFU/mL. Whereas 1 g of ceftolozane eradicated strains #2805 and #2842 without subsequent regrowth, 1 g ceftolozane/0.5 g tazobactam was required to eradicate strain #2890. For strain #2890, ceftolozane monotherapy led to bacterial growth on plates impregnated with 20 mg/L ceftolozane by 24 h, whilst combination treatment with tazobactam completely suppressed the development of ceftolozane resistance. In contrast, none of the regimens, including 2 g ceftolozane/1 g tazobactam, were able to entirely suppress bacterial growth in strain #2807, with bacterial counts exceeding 10(8) CFU/mL by 48 h and ceftolozane-resistant populations being amplified after 24 h. Thus, the combination of ceftolozane and tazobactam achieved bactericidal activity followed by sustained killing over 10 days for three of four isogenic E. coli strains. Ceftolozane/tazobactam is a promising new agent to counter multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.
