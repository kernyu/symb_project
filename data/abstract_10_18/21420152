OBJECTIVES: To report the sensitivity and resistance of Escherichia coli in patients with infectious complications after prostate biopsy in a North American cohort. Increasing antibiotic-resistant E. coli has been observed worldwide. METHODS: Data were available for 1446 patients who had undergone transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy from 2001 to 2010. Of the 1446 patients, 932 were administered 500 mg of ciprofloxacin 1 hour before prostate biopsy and 514 were administered a 3-day course of ciprofloxacin starting 1 day before biopsy plus an enema the night before. The sensitivity and resistance of E. coli were attained through the analysis of the blood and urine cultures of patients with suspected infection. RESULTS: Of the 1446 patients, 40 (2.77%) developed an infection after biopsy. Of these 40 patients, 31 (2.14%) had a febrile urinary tract infection and 9 (0.62%) were diagnosed with sepsis requiring hospitalization. Of the 40 patients, 20 (50%) had urine cultures positive for E. coli. Of these 20 patients, 11 (55%) had fluoroquinolone-resistant infection and 9 had fluoroquinolone-sensitive E. coli. Of the remaining 20 patients, culture was not obtained for 9, and 5 had negative urine culture findings. Of the 7 patients (78%) with sepsis had blood cultures positive for E. Coli; 4 (57.1%) of which were fluoroquinolone-resistant and 3 were fluoroquinolone-sensitive. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, a significant risk of fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli was observed in patients with both febrile urinary tract infection and sepsis after prostate biopsy. Alternative prophylactic antibiotics should be researched further, and postbiopsy infections developing after standard quinolone prophylaxis should be treated with cephalosporins until culture findings are available to guide therapy.
