Due to the indiscriminate use of antibiotics, resistance to antibiotics has increased remarkably in Staphylococcus aureus. Vancomycin is the final drug to treat the S. aureus infection, but nowadays, resistance to this antibiotic is also increasing. So, the investigation of antibiotic resistance pattern is important. As there is already resistance to vancomycin, there is an urgent need to develop a new kind of antimicrobial to treat S. aureus infection. Eugenol may be the new drug of choice. This study was conducted to evaluate the antibacterial activity of eugenol against vancomycin-resistant S. aureus isolated from clinical pus samples. Thirty six pus samples were included in the study. Samples were isolated, identified and antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed as per routine laboratory protocol. The antimicrobial activity and mechanisms of killing of eugenol were studied. Out of 36 pus samples, only 20 isolates were confirmed as S. aureus strains and 6 isolates exhibited vancomycin resistance. Eugenol successfully destroyed the vancomycin-resistant strains via reactive oxygen species generation and membrane damage. The prevalence of vancomycin resistance is increased day by day in different countries, and necessary steps to prevent the spread and emergence of resistance should be taken. The findings of the study suggested that eugenol might be used to treat vancomycin-resistant S. aureus.
