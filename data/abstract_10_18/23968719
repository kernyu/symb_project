A rapid and simple method for the detection of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis is critical for the efficient treatment and control of this pathogen in developing country. Here we developed a single multiplex amplification refractory mutation system (M-ARMS) PCR, in which chimeric-primer and temperature switch PCR (TSP) strategy were included. Using this method, we detected rifampin resistance-associated mutations at codons 511, 516, 526 and 531 in the rifampin resistance-determining region of rpoB gene. The performance of M-ARMS-PCR assay was evaluated with 135 cultured isolates of M. tuberculosis. The sensitivity and specificity were 94.2% and 100%, respectively, compared with direct DNA sequencing, and 86.67% and 89.71%, respectively, compared with culture-based phenotypic drug susceptibility testing. Therefore, this newly-developed M-ARMS-PCR method is useful and efficient with an intended application in provincial Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for rapid detection of rifampin resistance-associated mutations.
