The prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphyloccoccus aureus (MRSA) strains has presented a new challenge in antimicrobial medication. Linezolid is a new drug with potent activity on Gram-positive pathogens such as MRSA. The aim of the study was to investigate the in vitro activity of linezolid alone and in combination with imipenem, vancomycin or rifampicin to determine the most active therapy against MRSA strains. Twenty clinical MRSA strains were isolated from patients admitted to inpatient departments and outpatient clinics of Theodor Bilharz Research Institute. Standard strain MRSA ATCC 43300 was included as a control. The MICs of MRSA strains to linezolid, vancomycin, imipenem and rifampicin were evaluated using E test. Time-kill curve were used to assess the in vitro activity of linezolid (at 8x MIC) alone and in combination with imipenem (at 32x MIC), vancomycin or rifampicin (at 8x MIC). Scanning and transmission electron microscopy were performed to compare bacterial morphological alterations owing to the different combi- nations. Time-kill studies showed synergistic effect when linezolid combined with imipenem was tested against all the MRSA strains. Linezolid plus vancomycin or rifampicin combinations did not display any synergism or antagonism. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy observations confirmed the interactions observed in time kill experiments. Linezolid in combination with subinhibitory concentrations of imipenem can be bactericidal against MRSA strains and appears to be a promising combination for the treatment of MRSA infections. No synergistic activity was seen when the linezolid and vancomycin or rifampicin were combined. Linezolid could prevent the emergence of mutants resistant to rifampicin
