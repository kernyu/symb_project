Neonatal Sepsis is one of the most common reasons for admission to neonatal units in developing countries. It is also a major cause of mortality in both developed and developing countries. Identification of the common bacteria and risk factors causing such infections and their susceptibility patterns will provide necessary information for timely intervention. This study was carried out to determine the bacteriological profile and associated risk factors of neonatal sepsis in Paropakar Maternity and Women's hospital. A cross-sectional prospective study was conducted among neonates suspected of neonatal sepsis. Blood culture was performed and organisms were identified and antibiotic susceptibility was carried out with standard microbiological methods. Data were analysed by using SPSS. Ver. 16 software. The positive yield of blood culture was 21%. The most common isolates were Staphylococcus epidermidis, E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas spp. In Antibiotic susceptibility pattern Gentamycin showed the highest sensitivity to all types of isolated organisms. Vancomycin sensitivity was highest for Gram positive organism and Ciprofloxacin was most effective for Gram negative organisms isolated. Ampicillin and Amoxycillin were the least effective drug. Multiple drug resistance was observed in 77.15% of isolates. Prematurity, low birth weight and maternal pyrexia before delivery were found to be strongly associated with neonatal sepsis. Gram positive organisms were more prevalent than gram negative organisms.
