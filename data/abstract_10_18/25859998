BACKGROUND: Little is known about drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) and its transmission in Papua, which has one of the highest rates of TB in Indonesia. DESIGN: We examined genotypic drug resistance patterns using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and the degree of molecular clustering using 24-locus mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units-variable number of tandem repeats (MIRU-VNTR) among 199 consecutive pulmonary TB patients in Jayapura, Papua. RESULTS: Drug resistance mutations were present in 30/198 (15.2%) patients: 16/144 (11.1%) primary cases and 14/51 (27.5%) retreatment cases. Genotypic resistance to rifampicin was found in 15 (7.6%) patients, to isoniazid in 19 (9.6%), to ethambutol in 7 (3.5%), and to streptomycin and second-line injectable drugs in 5 (2.5%) patients. Eight (4.0%) patients had multidrug-resistant TB, while no mutations were found for fluoroquinolones. The most common lineage found among all isolates was East-African Indian (n = 66, 33.7%), followed by Euro-American (n = 38, 19.4%). Drug resistance mutations were more common among Beijing strains than other lineages. Of the 30 drug-resistant isolates, 12 (40.0%) fell into four clusters that were separate from drug-susceptible clusters as determined using MIRU-VNTR. CONCLUSIONS: These are the first genotypic drug resistance data from Jayapura, Papua, showing moderate rates of resistance to first-line drugs and likely transmission of drug-resistant TB.
