AIM: Study the main surface parameters of milled polyacrylic materials using atomic force microscopy and primary microbial adhesion of periodontopathogenic group bacteria and Candida albicans fungi taking into consideration the method of sample polishing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Studied samples: mill-treated without polishing (control); ergobox polished; polished in dental laboratory conditions; polished by a rubber brush in dentists' office. Microbial strains belonging to periodontopathogenic species (clinical isolates) that had been isolated from periodontal pockets of periodontitis patients: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus sanguis, C. albicans fungi were used for modelling experiments of primary adhesion of microbes to the material samples. RESULTS: S. sanguis had the highest degree of adhesion to polymer after milling, P. gingivalis, C. albicans--medium, F. nucleatum--low. A significant reduction of adhesion is observed during polishing in dental laboratory conditions or ergobox, less significant--during polishing in dental office. CONCLUSION: The data obtained allow to make a conclusion that the samples from polymer materials for preparation of prosthesis basis have varying degree of intensity of microbial adhesion of members of periodontopathogenic microflora and C. albicans fungi that depends on the polishing method, that accordingly determined the differences in colonization resistance against formation of microbial biofilm during polymer use in clinical conditions. . ,
