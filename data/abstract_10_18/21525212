Several plus-strand RNA viruses encode proteins containing macrodomains. These domains possess ADP-ribose-1''-phosphatase (ADRP) activity and/or bind poly(ADP-ribose), poly(A) or poly(G). The relevance of these activities in the viral life cycle has not yet been resolved. Here, we report that genetically engineered mutants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) expressing ADRP-deficient macrodomains displayed an increased sensitivity to the antiviral effect of alpha interferon compared with their wild-type counterparts. The data suggest that macrodomain-associated ADRP activities may have a role in viral escape from the innate immune responses of the host.
