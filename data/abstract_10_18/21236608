OBJECTIVE: We aimed to attract our colleagues' attention to the oropharyngeal tularemia, which has been an infrequently diagnosed disease in otolaryngology clinics also becoming widespread in Turkey. METHODS: A retrospective review of database of 3 patients was performed to find patients with Tularemia. The medical files, treatment charts, serological and PCR findings and radiological (magnetic resonance imaging), histopathological records of these patients were reviewed. RESULTS: The study group consisted of 3 oropharyngeal tularemia patients. All of them presented with tonsillopharyngitis and cervical lymphadenitis and all were resistant to beta lactam or cephalosporin group antibiotics. Two patients had magnetic resonance imaging findings. All patients had positive serological tests. Strongly positive serological tests led to the diagnosis of tularemia. All patients had positive PCR and direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test. All patients responded to systemic streptomycin treatment. CONCLUSION: In the daily practice of an otolaryngologist, it is not usual to diagnose a patient with oropharyngeal tularemia. Tularemia should be considered in the differential diagnosis of massive adenotonsillar enlargement and extensive necrotic cervical lymphadenopathy not responding to beta lactam antibiotics as a result of the rising number of tularemia outbreaks outside the classic endemic areas.
