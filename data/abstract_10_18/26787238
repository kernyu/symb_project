BACKGROUND: The IFM2009-02 trial studied pomalidomide (4 mg daily, 21/28 versus 28/28) and dexamethasone in very advanced relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). We observed that 40% of patients had a prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) and subsequently overall survival (OS). We sought to analyze the characteristics of these patients and study the effect of long exposure to pomalidomide. DESIGN: We separated the studied population into two groups: 3 months to 1 year (<1 year) and more than 1 year (>/=1 year) of treatment with pomalidomide and dexamethasone based on clinical judgment and historical control studies. We then analyzed the characteristics of patients according to duration of treatment. RESULTS: The overall response rate (ORR) for the <1-year group was 43%, the median PFS 4.6 months [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 3.8-6.4] with only 6% at 12 months, and the median OS was 15 months (11.7-20.3) and 40% at 18 months. For the >/=1-year group, the response rate and survival were strikingly different, ORR at 83%, median PFS 20.7 months (14.7-35.4), median OS not reached, and 91% at 18 months. CONCLUSION: Pomalidomide and dexamethasone favored prolonged and safe exposure to treatment in 40% of heavily treated and end-stage RRMM, a paradigm shift in the natural history of RRMM characterized with a succession of shorter disease-free intervals and ultimately shorter survival. Although an optimization of pomalidomide-dexamethasone regimen is warranted in advanced RRMM, we claim that pomalidomide has proven once more to change the natural history of myeloma in this series, which should be confirmed in a larger study.
