Crotalicidin (Ctn), a 34-residue cathelicidin from a South American rattlesnake, and its fragment (Ctn[15-34]) have shown anti-infective and cytotoxic activities against Gram-negative bacteria and certain tumor lines, respectively. The extent of such effects has been related to physicochemical characteristics such as helicity and hydrophobicity. We now report the anti-fungal activity of Ctn and its fragments (Ctn[1-14]) and (Ctn[15-34]). MIC determination and luminescent cell viability assays were used to evaluate the anti-infective activity of Ctn and its fragments (Ctn[1-14]) and (Ctn[15-34]) as anti-fungal agents against opportunistic yeast and dermatophytes. Cytotoxicity towards healthy eukaryotic cells was assessed in vitro with healthy human kidney-2 (HK-2) cells and erythrocytes. The checkerboard technique was performed to estimate the effects of combining either one of the peptides with amphotericin B. Ctn was the most active peptide against dermatophytes and also the most toxic to healthy eukaryotic cells. Fragments Ctn[1-14] and Ctn[15-35] lost activity against dermatophytes, but became more active against pathogenic yeasts, including several Candida species, both clinical isolates and standard strains, with MICs as low as 5 mum. Interestingly, the two peptide fragments were less cytotoxic to healthy HK-2 cells and less hemolytic to human erythrocytes than the standard-of-care amphotericin B. Also noteworthy was the synergy between Ctn peptides and amphotericin B, with consequent reduction in MICs of both drug and peptides. Altogether, Ctn and its fragments, particularly Ctn[15-34], are promising leads, either alone or in combined regimen with amphotericin B, for the treatment of fungal diseases.
