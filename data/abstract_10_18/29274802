A nationwide study was developed to evaluate the ability of 60 Spanish clinical microbiology laboratories to predict the underlying beta-lactam resistance mechanisms of 12 Enterobacteriaceae strains (CCS01-CCS12). Results obtained by two reference laboratories were compared with those reported by the participant laboratories that used their own routine susceptibility testing methodology. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) interpretive criteria were used in 53.3% of centres, whilst 46.7% used European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) criteria. Overall categorical agreement (CA) was 85.5%. Rates of very major errors (VME), minor errors (MinE) and major errors (ME) were 5%, 9.7% and 5.5%, respectively. The lowest CA values were obtained for carbapenems (56.7-78.1%). beta-Lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors were also problematic compounds: VME for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid were 8% (EUCAST criteria) and MinE for piperacillin/tazobactam were 45.7% (CLSI criteria). OXA-48 (CCS02, CCS10, CCS11), VIM-1 (CCS09) and KPC-3 (CCS05) were correctly identified by 75-87%, 65% and 71% of centres, respectively. Strains with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) plus a carbapenemase (CCS03, CCS04, CCS06) were correctly detected in 32-68% of centres. Seven percent correct identifications were recorded for CCS08 (chromosomal K1 beta-lactamase hyperexpression plus IMP-8). Strains with permeability deficiencies [CCS07 (ACT-1 plus porin deficit) and CCS12 (TEM-24 plus porin deficit)] were correctly detected in 17% and 10% of centres, respectively. The TEM-1-producer (CCS01) was detected in 40% of centres. Microbiologists should be aware of new antibiotic resistance mechanisms, and these surveillance studies are particularly useful for this purpose and for the communication of such traits.
