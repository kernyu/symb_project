Treatment of chronic hepatitis C with pegylated interferon-a and ribavirin is now adapted individually based on the virological response on treatment. This approach should improve the tolerability while maintaining or even improving in some patients the efficacy of antiviral therapy. Several new antiviral drugs are currently being evaluated in advanced clinical trials, with very promising results. These new drugs should greatly broaden treatment options for chronic hepatitis C in the near future.
