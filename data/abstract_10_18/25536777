AIM: Analysis of antibiotic resistance profiles of Vibrio cholerae O1 strains isolated from the environmental objects in the territory of Russia in 2005 - 2012. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antibiotocograms of 52 strains of V. cholerae were determined by serial dilution method in dense nutrient medium. Interpretation of the results was carried out in accordance with guidelines MI 4.2.2495-09 (2009). RESULTS: All the cultures turned out to be sensitive to tetracyclines, ciprofloxacin, cephalosporins: Isolates from Stavropol region were resistant to furazolidone (33.3%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (100%). Strains resistant to ampicillin, streptomycin, rifampicin (7%), furazolidone (43%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (100%) were isolated in Primorsky region. In Irkutsk region and Kalmykia--to furazolidone and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (11 - 89%), ampicillin (8.3 - 11%). Analysis of antibioticograms gives evidence on the occurrence in the studied strains of 1 to 5 r-determinants of antibiotic resistance in various combinations. CONCLUSION: The data obtained give evidence on preservation of the tendency to expand the specter of antibiotic resistance in V. cholerae O1 isolated from environmental objects that necessitates a more rational and effective use of antibacterial preparations, determination of antiobioticogram for every isolated culture, strict bacteriologic control during the course of etiotropic therapy for the prevention of increase of number of resistant strains.
