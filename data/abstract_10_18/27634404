A novel HIV-1 inhibitor, 6-(tert-butyl)-4-phenyl-4-(trifluoromethyl)-1H,3H-1,3,5-triazin-2-one (compound 1), was identified from a compound library screened for the ability to inhibit HIV-1 replication. EC50 values of compound 1 were found to range from 107.9 to 145.4 nm against primary HIV-1 clinical isolates. In in vitro assays, HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) activity was inhibited by compound 1 with an EC50 of 4.3 mum. An assay for resistance to compound 1 selected a variant of HIV-1 with a RT mutation (RT(L100I) ); this frequently identified mutation confers mild resistance to non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs). A recombinant HIV-1 bearing RT(L100I) exhibited a 41-fold greater resistance to compound 1 than the wild-type virus. Compound 1 was also effective against HIV-1 with RT(K103N) , one of the major mutations that confers substantial resistance to NNRTIs. Computer-assisted docking simulations indicated that compound 1 binds to the RT NNRTI binding pocket in a manner similar to that of efavirenz; however, the putative compound 1 binding site is located further from RT(K103) than that of efavirenz. Compound 1 is a novel NNRTI with a unique drug-resistance profile.
