OBJECTIVE: To explore the antibiotic resistance of Brucella melitensis and instruct rational use of antimicrobial agents in clinical treatment of Brucella infection. METHODS: Bacteria were cultured and identified by BACTEC9120 and VITEK II automicrobic system. E-test was used to detect the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antimicrobial agents in the drug susceptivity experiment. RESULTS: A total of 19 brucella strains (all Brucella melitensis) were isolated from 19 patients, who had fever between January 2010 and June 2012, and 17 samples were blood, one was bone marrow, the other sample was cerebrospinal fluid. The MIC range of ceftazidime was 2.0-8.0 mg/L, rifampicin was 0.06-2.0 mg/L, amikacin was 4.0-12.0 mg/L, levofloxacin was 2.0-8.0 mg/L, doxycycline was 8.0-32.0 mg/L, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim was 4.0-16.0 mg/L, ampicillin was 1.5-2.0 mg/L and gentamicin was 0.50-0.75 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: The drugs used in this experiment cover common drugs for treating Brucella. Meanwhile, the results are consistent with clinical efficacy. It is suggested personalized regimen according to patients' status in treatment of Brucella.
