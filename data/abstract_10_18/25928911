Arcobacter butzleri and A. cryaerophilus are considered potential foodborne pathogens. Consumption of Arcobacter-contaminated food is regarded the most likely source of human poisoning. We investigated the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of Arcobacter isolates in 210 retail meat samples. Seventy-nine A. butzleri and 6 A. cryaerophilus were isolated from pork, beef and chicken meat. Incidence ofA. butzleri was found to be the highest in chicken meat (83%). Less of A. butzleri was isolated from beef (16%) and pork (14%). Most of the A. butzleri isolates were resistant to beta-lactams, like ampicillin (85%), amoxicillin with clavulonic acid (63%), cefotaxime (66%) and mac- rolides, i.e., erythromycin (62%). In contrast, all except one A. cryaerophilus isolates were susceptible to erythromycin. Tetracycline and aminoglycosides showed the highest efficacy against A. butzleri and A. cryaerophilus since almost 80% of their population was susceptible to these agents. All, except one A. cryaerophilus and the majority ofA. butzleri isolates (70%) were susceptible to fluoroquinolones. The incidence of multiresistant isolates was found in forty two (53%) A. butzleri, and one (16%) A. cryaerophilus isolates Eight A. butzleri isolates were resistant to all antimicrobials tested. These results indicate significant incidence of potential foodborne zoonotic agents, i.e. A. butzleri and A. cryaerophilus including multiresistant isolates in retail meat in Poland.
