Thyme oil (TO) fumigation (96mull(-1)) to cv. Hass and Ryan avocados significantly reduced anthracnose incidence compared to prochloraz and the untreated control. Also, enhanced activities of beta-1,3-glucanase, chitinase were noted in both cultivars. TO fumigation induced the expression of both beta-1,3-glucanase and chitinase genes in naturally infected fruit of both cultivars, during storage at 7 or 7.5 degrees C for up to 21d and during subsequent simulated market shelf conditions at 20 degrees C for 5d. However, the impact of TO fumigation on the beta-1,3-glucanase gene expression was higher in both cultivars. Higher gene regulation and beta-1,3-glucanase, chitinase activities were observed in cv. Ryan compared to Hass. Although TO fumigation significantly reduced anthracnose incidence in both naturally infected cultivars, the inhibitory effect was slightly higher in cv. Ryan than Hass. Thus, postharvest TO fumigation had positive effects on enhancing anthracnose disease resistance during storage and also gave a residual effect during the simulated shelf life.
