OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of Telbivudine (LDT) Tablet combined with Jianpi Bushen Recipe (JBR) on serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and HBeAg seroconversion in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. METHODS: Totally 90 HBeAg-positive and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2 positive CHB patients were randomly assigned to the treatment group and the control group, 45 cases in each group. Patients in the treatment group took LDT Tablet (600 mg, once per day) combined with JBR granule (twice per day), while those in the control group took LDT Tablet alone. The therapeutic course for all was one year. HBV DNA negative conversion rate, HBeAg seroconversion rate, and level of HBV specific CTL were compared after 1 year treatment; liver function, drug resistance mutations, and adverse reactions were also compared between the two groups. RESULTS: After 1 year treatment, HBV DNA negative conversion rate and HBeAg seroconversion rate were 88.89% (40/45) and 40.00% (18/45) in the treatment group, higher than those of the control group [68.89% (31/45) and 20.00% (9/45)], with statistical difference (P < 0.05). Level of HBV specific CTL in the treatment group was 0.78% +/- 0.09% after treatment, higher than that of the control group after 1 year treatment (0.54% +/- 0.11%) and that before treatment (0.36% +/- 0.07%), with statistical difference (P < 0.01). Level of HBV specific CTL in 27 patients with HBeAg seroconversion was 0.81% 0.10%, higher than that of 63 patients without HBeAg seroconversion (0.60% +/- 0.09%), with statistical difference (P < 0.01). ALT returned to normal in 44 cases of the treatment group (97.78%), while it was 42 cases (93.33%) of the control group, with no statistical difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). Total bilirubin (TBil) in the two groups all turned to normal. rtM204I variation occurred in 1 case (2.22%) of the treatment group and 2 cases (4.44%) in the control group. No obvious adverse reaction occurred in the two groups. CONCLUSION: LDT Tablet combined with JBR could elevate levels of HBV specific CTL and HBeAg seroconversion in CHB patients.
