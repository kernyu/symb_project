We present 2 cases of a 3-month-old girl and boy who were diagnosed with an infected pseudoaneurysm 2 months after undergoing left-sided modified Blalock-Taussig shunt (mBTS) operations for pulmonary atresia. Because the shunts in both cases were nearly obstructed, they underwent a 2-stage surgical approach: classic BTS operations through a right thoracotomy to establish sufficient pulmonary flow and infected graft removal through a median sternotomy after close observation of the state of the aneurysms. By utilizing autologous tissue from a different thoracic entry, both patients were successfully managed and recovered without any recurrence of infection.
