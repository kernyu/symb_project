Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a leading cause of neonatal bacterial infections in developed countries. Early-onset disease (EOD) occurs at day 0-6 and late-onset disease occurs at day 7-89. Currently, the prevention of EOD relies upon intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) given to women who are GBS positive at prenatal screening or women with risk factors for EOD. Although successfully implemented, IAP has not fully eradicated EOD, and incidence rates of late-onset disease remain unchanged. Furthermore, antibiotic resistance may result from widespread antibiotic use. New prophylactic strategies are therefore of critical importance. A vaccine active against GBS, administered during pregnancy and combined with targeted IAP, could overcome these problems and reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with invasive diseases.
