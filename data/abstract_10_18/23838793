This study elucidated the importance of two critical enzymes in the regulation of butanol production in Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824. Overexpression of both the 6-phosphofructokinase (pfkA) and pyruvate kinase (pykA) genes increased intracellular concentrations of ATP and NADH and also resistance to butanol toxicity. Marked increases of butanol and ethanol production, but not acetone, were also observed in batch fermentation. The butanol and ethanol concentrations were 29.4 and 85.5 % higher, respectively, in the fermentation by double-overexpressed C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824/pfkA+pykA than the wild-type strain. Furthermore, when fed-batch fermentation using glucose was carried out, the butanol and total solvent (acetone, butanol, and ethanol) concentrations reached as high as 19.12 and 28.02 g/L, respectively. The reason for improved butanol formation was attributed to the enhanced NADH and ATP concentrations and increased tolerance to butanol in the double-overexpressed strain.
