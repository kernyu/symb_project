Estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRalpha) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily controlling energy homeostasis; however, its precise role in regulating antiviral innate immunity remains to be clarified. Here, we showed that ERRalpha deficiency conferred resistance to viral infection both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, ERRalpha inhibited the production of type-I interferon (IFN-I) and the expression of multiple interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Furthermore, we found that viral infection induced TBK1-dependent ERRalpha stabilization, which in turn associated with TBK1 and IRF3 to impede the formation of TBK1-IRF3, IRF3 phosphorylation, IRF3 dimerization, and the DNA binding affinity of IRF3. The effect of ERRalpha on IFN-I production was independent of its transcriptional activity and PCG-1alpha. Notably, ERRalpha chemical inhibitor XCT790 has broad antiviral potency. This work not only identifies ERRalpha as a critical negative regulator of antiviral signaling, but also provides a potential target for future antiviral therapy.
