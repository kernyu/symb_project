Salmonella spp are among the main causative agents of foodborne diseases. Some phenotypes associated with increased drug resistance and virulence are regulated by quorum sensing (QS). In the present study, the autoinducer (AI)-1- and -2-mediated QS mechanisms were characterized in Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis PT4 for the first time. Salmonella Enteritidis did not produce AI-1. Phylogenetic analysis of nucleotides encoding the SdiA protein, the response regulator of AI-1-mediated QS, and comparative alignment of its amino acids showed that the gene and protein are conserved within the same bacterial genus. Thus, bacteria of the same genus respond to the same AIs. However, this finding did not preclude the possibility that Salmonella Enteritidis might respond to AIs released from bacteria of a different genus, which might confer a competitive advantage to this pathogen. We found that the regulation of AI-2-mediated QS in Salmonella Enteritidis is similar to that in serovar Typhimurium. The elucidation of the AI-1- and AI-2-mediated QS mechanisms in Salmonella Enteritidis will contribute to the development of new control strategies for this pathogen by indicating new targets for antimicrobial drugs.
