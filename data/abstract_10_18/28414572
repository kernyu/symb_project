OBJECTIVE: The objective was to characterize a group of clinical isolates of fluoroquinolone-resistant Haemophilus parainfluenzae collected in Northern Spain (March-December 2014). METHODS: Twelve clinical isolates of H. parainfluenzae were studied by performing antimicrobial susceptibility testing and PCR amplification and nucleotide sequencing of the QRDR (quinolone resistance-determining region) of gyrA, parC, gyrB, and parE genes. Screening for plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) was also studied. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used for molecular typing. RESULTS: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that all the isolates were resistant to the fluoroquinolones tested (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, norfloxacin, and moxifloxacin). Analysis of the QRDR demonstrated that all the isolates presented mutations in gyrA and parC. A Glu88Lys substitution in ParC is reported for the first time in H. parainfluenzae. No PMQR gene was detected. PFGE results showed that isolates were not clonally related. CONCLUSION: Multiple H. parainfluenzae fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates grouped in the same area in a short period of time showed diverse substitutions in QRDR of gyrA/parC and were not clonally related, indicating individual emergence. In addition, we described the first report of Glu88Lys substitution in ParC.
