INTRODUCTION: There has been a striking increase in the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens in recent times. Delafloxacin is a novel, broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone with antimicrobial activity against resistant Gram-positive, Gram-negative and anaerobic organisms. It has the potential to treat a variety of infections including complicated skin and skin structure infections and respiratory tract infections. AREAS COVERED: In this review, the authors report the microbiological spectrum of activity of delafloxacin as well as its pharmacokinetic characteristics. They also report the results of recent studies investigating its safety and efficacy. EXPERT OPINION: The profile of delafloxacin offers several advantages. Delafloxacin presents a broad spectrum of activity against pathogens involved in respiratory infections and complicated skin and skin structure infections (SSSIs), including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. It has also shown activity against Gram-negative pathogens, such as quinolone-susceptible and -resistant strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae and quinolone-susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The availability of an oral formulation supports its use in sequential therapy. The efficacy and tolerability of delafloxacin have been demonstrated in Phase II clinical trials in comparison with moxifloxacin for respiratory infections and linezolid and vancomycin in SSSIs. Compared with other quinolones such as moxifloxacin, delafloxacin showed comparable efficacy and a lower rate of adverse effects. The results of new Phase III studies are awaited to confirm delafloxacin's future applications in the treatment of SSSIs.
