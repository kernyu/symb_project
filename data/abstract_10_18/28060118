Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a frequent complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplant in pediatric patients, with significant morbidity and mortality. Antiviral drugs are used as prophylactic, preemptive or therapeutic medicines; however, no uniform guidelines exist for the best strategy to prevent CMV disease. Resistance to standard antiviral therapies can lead to further difficulty in managing CMV disease. Studies for investigational therapies are underway and could provide options for treatment of resistant CMV, while limiting toxicities associated with currently used antiviral therapies.
