The emergence of oseltamivir resistance in seasonal and pandemic influenza A/H1N1 has created challenges for diagnosis and clinical management. This review discusses how clinical virology laboratories have handled diagnosis of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 and what we have learned from clinical studies and case series. Immunocompetent patients infected with oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 have similar outcomes as patients infected with oseltamivir-susceptible H1N1. However, immunocompromised patients infected with oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 experience potentially more risks of complication and transmissibility with few therapeutic options.
