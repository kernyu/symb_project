Herpes simplex virus (HSV) resistance to antivirals constitutes a therapeutic challenge, especially among immunocompromised patients. This observational survey on HSV resistance to antivirals was conducted retrospectively over a 4-year period (2008-2012). A total of 211 HSV-positive clinical samples (94 HSV-1 and 117 HSV-2) recovered from 139 patients (11 immunocompetent patients, 85 immunocompromised patients, and 43 patients with unknown immune status) with suspected HSV drug-resistance were analyzed for acyclovir and foscarnet susceptibility. Antiviral resistance testing consisted in a two-step procedure including a first-step genotypic assay, based on UL23 (thymidine kinase, TK) and UL30 (Pol) gene sequencing, and a second-step phenotypic assay (i.e., plaque reduction assay) performed when unpreviously described mutations were detected. As a whole, susceptibility and resistance to antivirals were evidenced for 58 (30.7%) and 86 (45.5%) HSV, respectively, whereas antiviral profile remained undetermined for 45 (23.8%) HSV. The prevalence of drug resistance was significantly higher among HSV-2 isolates than among HSV-1 isolates (53.8% vs. 34.9%; p=0.012). The majority (i.e., 79.7%) of cases of ACV resistance conferred by TK mutations resulted from UL23 gene frameshift reading. Apart from the changes surely related to natural polymorphism or drug-resistance, 91 unpreviously reported mutations were identified in TK and Pol, including 51 potential natural polymorphisms, 22 mutations likely conferring resistance to antivirals, and 18 mutations of unclear significance.
