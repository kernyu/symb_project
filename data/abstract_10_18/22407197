Overuse of broad-spectrum antimicrobials has resulted in bacterial resistance and increasing use of relatively expensive antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We hypothesized that CAP requiring parenteral medication is still curable with narrow-spectrum and inexpensive penicillin G. A prospective, randomized study was performed on 58 children aged 3 months to 15 years with CAP. Children were randomly assigned to receive low-dose penicillin G, high penicillin G, or cefuroxime intravenously for 4-7 days. The course of illness was monitored clinically and with predetermined laboratory and radiological indices for 30 days. The children recovered at the same rate with no significant differences in time to defervescence or duration of hospitalization. Observed differences in leukocyte counts and C-reactive protein at discharge were of questionable clinical significance. Penicillin G is as effective and safe as cefuroxime for CAP in otherwise healthy children, even in moderate doses.
