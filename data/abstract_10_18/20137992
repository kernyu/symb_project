We describe the clinical course of a previously healthy 20-month-old toddler admitted with high fever and leukocytosis. Blood culture grew Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 19A, belonging to the ST663 clone, highly resistant to penicillin, ceftriaxone, and erythromycin. The same clone with identical antibiogram was isolated from the nasopharynx of another three of the other five healthy children attending the same daycare center as the patient. This case exemplifies the potential problems posed by highly-resistant S. pneumoniae serotype 19A, an emerging pathogen worldwide.
