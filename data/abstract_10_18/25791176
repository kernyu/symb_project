BACKGROUND: Recent advances in interferon-free treatment could lead to the eradication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) from patients infected with HCV. One of the direct-acting anti-viral agents, HCV NS5A inhibitor, is available for these combination therapies. However, naturally occurring resistance-associated variants (RAVs) to HCV NS5A inhibitors in treatment-naive patients chronically infected with HCV genotype 1b are still unknown. METHODS: We performed ultra-deep sequencing and analysed previously reported RAVs in a total 132 HCV genotype 1b-infected Japanese patients who had never used HCV NS5A inhibitors. We also performed direct-sequencing by Sanger method in consecutively selected 50 of the total 132 samples, and the differences between the results of the two methods were compared. RESULTS: In the comparison of the variant frequencies of ultra-deep sequencing with RAVs of direct-sequencing by Sanger method in 50 patients, we identified 32 RAVs by direct-sequencing with the Sanger method; minimum variant frequency was shown by ultra-deep sequencing to be 9%. A total of 110 RAVs were identified only by ultra-deep sequencing. In the samples from all 132 patients, L31W (2.3%), L31V (49.2%), L31F (41.7%), L31M (1.5%), L31I (5.3%), L31S (2.0%), L31P (3.0%) and L31R (0.8%), and Y93N (2.3%), Y93H (25%), Y93C (0.8%), Y93P (2.3%) and Y93D (0.8%) were identified. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated naturally-occurring RAVs of HCV NS5A inhibitors by ultra-deep sequencing and that several mutations including Y93H are common in HCV NS5A inhibitor-treatment-naive patients with chronic HCV genotype 1b. Careful attention should be paid to these RAVs, and further improvement of treatment options might be needed.
