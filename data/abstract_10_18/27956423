A novel 4-aminoquinoline derivative [(S)-7-chloro-N-(4-methyl-1-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)pentan-2-yl)-quinolin-4-amine triphosphate] exhibiting curative activity against chloroquine-resistant malaria parasites has been identified for preclinical development as a blood schizonticidal agent. The lead molecule selected after detailed structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies has good solid-state properties and promising activity against in vitro and in vivo experimental malaria models. The in vitro absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) parameters indicate a favorable drug-like profile.
