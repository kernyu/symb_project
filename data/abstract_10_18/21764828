OBJECTIVES: Because of the spread of drug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria, the use of linezolid for treating severe infections is increasing. However, clinical experience in the paediatric population is still limited. We undertook a multicentre study to analyse the use of linezolid in children. METHODS: Hospitalized children treated with linezolid for a suspected or proven Gram-positive or mycobacterial infection were analysed retrospectively. Side effects were investigated, focusing on younger children and long-term treatments. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients (mean age 6.8 years, range 7 days to 17 years) were studied. Mean +/- SD linezolid treatment duration was 26.13 +/- 17 days. Clinical cure was achieved in 74.7% of patients. The most frequent adverse events were diarrhoea and vomiting. Two patients had severe anaemia, two neutropenia and one thrombocytopenia. Two cases of grade 3 liver function test elevation and one case of pancreatitis were reported. The overall frequency of adverse events was similar between patients treated for >28 days and those receiving shorter treatments (30.8% versus 28.6%, P = 0.84). Children aged <2 years received linezolid for a shorter duration than older children (21.2 days versus 28.4 days, P = 0.05), whereas the frequency of adverse events was similar in the two age groups. CONCLUSIONS: In our paediatric population, linezolid appeared safe and effective for the treatment of selected Gram-positive and mycobacterial infections. The adverse reactions encountered were reversible and appeared comparable to those reported in paediatric clinical trials. Nevertheless, the potential for haematological toxicity of linezolid in children means that careful monitoring is required during treatment.
