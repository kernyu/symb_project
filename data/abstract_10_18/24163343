Although fosfomycin is an old antibiotic, it has resurfaced with particular interest. The antibiotic is still effective against many pathogens that are resistant to other commonly used antibiotics. We have found that fosfomycin resistance of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 is controlled by the bacterial two-component signal transduction system CpxAR. A cpxA mutant lacking its phosphatase activity results in constitutive activation of its cognate response regulator, CpxR, and fosfomycin resistance. We have shown that fosfomycin resistance requires CpxR because deletion of the cpxR gene in the cpxA mutant restores fosfomycin sensitivity. We have also shown that CpxR directly represses the expression of two genes, glpT and uhpT, which encode transporters that cotransport fosfomycin with their native substrates glycerol-3-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate, and repression of these genes leads to a decrease in fosfomycin transport into the cpxA mutant. However, the cpxA mutant had an impaired growth phenotype when cultured with glycerol-3-phosphate or glucose-6-phosphate as a sole carbon substrate and was outcompeted by the parent strain, even in nutrient-rich medium. This suggests a trade-off between fosfomycin resistance and the biological fitness associated with carbon substrate uptake. We propose a role for the CpxAR system in the reversible control of fosfomycin resistance. This may be a beneficial strategy for bacteria to relieve the fitness burden that results from fosfomycin resistance in the absence of fosfomycin.
