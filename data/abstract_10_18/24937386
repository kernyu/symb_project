Diminished insulin sensitivity is a characteristic feature of various pathological conditions such as hypertension and activation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) has been shown to enhance insulin resistance and reduce capacity for glucose uptake in muscles. The present study was designed to evaluate the interactions of PPARalpha and GLUT4 in a model of hypertensive renal injury by studying deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt induced hypertension in wild-type (WT) and PPARalpha knockout (KO) mice. PPARalpha WT and KO mice were uninephrectomized (UNx) and implanted subcutaneously DOCA and drank 1% sodium chloride/1% potassium chloride with or without a GLUT4 antagonist, indinavir (20 mg/kg/day, s.c) or PPARalpha ligand, fenofibrate (100 mg/kg/day, orally). DOCA/salt treatment increased urinary sodium excretion and urine volume (p&lt;0.05) in PPARalpha KO mice compared to WT littermates. Indinavir increased proteinuria (p&lt;0.01) in DOCA/salt-treated PPARalpha KO mice compared to WT littermates but did not affect heart and kidney weight index in DOCA/salt KO or WT-treated mice. Urinary sodium excretion (UNaV) and urine volume (UV) were increased by indinavir (p&lt;0.01) and fenofibrate (p&lt;0.05) in DOCA/salt-treated PPARalpha KO mice compared to WT mice. Urinary nitric oxide was greater in both fenofibrate (p&lt;0.05) and indinavir-treated WT mice (p&lt;0.05) compared to KO mice. These data suggest that in hypertensive nephropathy, GLUT4 probably exerts a renoprotective role that was enhanced with the activation of PPARalpha receptors by a mechanism that may be related to increased nitric oxide production.
