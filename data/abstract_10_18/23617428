BACKGROUND: The ability of boron-containing compounds to undergo a number of novel binding interactions with drug target functional groups has recently been described. In an extension of this work, we have incorporated a boron-containing scaffold, the benzoxaborole, into several glycopeptides antibiotics. The aim of this work is to exploit the inherent reactivity of boron to gain additional interactions with the bacterial cell wall components to improve binding affinity and to thereby overcome resistance. RESULTS: Three antibacterial glycopeptides (vancomycin, eremomycin and teicoplanin aglycone) have been selected for the construction of a series of 12 new benzoxaborole-glycopeptide conjugates. The hybrid antibiotics, in which the benzoxaborole and glycopeptide moieties were separated by a linker, exhibited excellent antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including those with intermediate susceptibility to glycopeptides. Some analogs also demonstrated activity against vancomycin-resistant enterococci. CONCLUSION: Conjugation of antibiotics with benzoxaborole derivatives provides antibiotics with new and useful properties. Teicoplanin aglycone-benzoxaborole derivatives overcome resistance of Gram-positive bacteria to vancomycin.
