We hypothesized that prostacyclin (PGI2) protects vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) against apoptosis and phenotypic switch through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha) activation and 14-3-3 upregulation. Here we showed that transfection of rat aortic VSMC, A-10, with PGI2-producing vectors, Ad-COPI, resulted in attenuated H2O2-induced apoptosis accompanied by a selective increase in 14-3-3beta and 14-3-3theta expression. Carbaprostacyclin (cPGI2) and Wy14,643 exerted a similar effect. The effects of PGI2 were abrogated by MK886, a PPARalpha antagonist, but not GSK3787, a PPARdelta antagonist. PPARalpha transfection upregulated 14-3-3beta and theta expression and attenuated H2O2-induced apoptosis. H2O2-induced 14-3-3beta but not 14-3-3theta degradation was blocked by a caspase 3 inhibitor. Furthermore, 14-3-3beta but not 14-3-3theta overexpression reduced, while 14-3-3beta siRNA aggravated apoptosis. VSMC contractile proteins and serum response factor (SRF) were reduced in H2O2-treated A-10 cells which were concurrently prevented by caspase 3 inhibitor. By contrast, PGI2 prevented H2O2-induced SM22alpha and Calponin-1 degradation without influencing SRF. cPGI2 and Wy14,643 also effectively blocked VSMC phenotypic switch induced by growth factors (GFs). GFs suppressed 14-3-3beta, theta, epsilon and eta isoforms and cPGI2 prevented the decline of beta, theta and eta, but not epsilon. 14-3-3theta siRNA abrogated the protective effect of cPGI2 on SM22alpha and Calponin-1 while 14-3-3 theta or 14-3-3beta overexpression partially restored SM22alpha. These results indicated that PGI2 protects VSMCs via PPARalpha by upregulating 14-3-3beta and 14-3-3theta. 14-3-3beta upregulation confers resistance to apoptosis whereas 14-3-3theta and beta upregulation protects SM22alpha and Calponin-1 from degradation.
