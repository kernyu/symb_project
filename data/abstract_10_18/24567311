Neonatal Candida infections are the leading cause of invasive fungal infections that might cause severe morbidity or mortality in a large majority of those affected. Although Candida albicans has been the most common species, Candida parapsilosis is increasingly being recognized as an important cause of invasive candidiasis in neonates. Among the Candida species, C. parapsilosis has been commonly isolated and shown to be less susceptible in vitro to echinocandins than other Candida species. We report an infant who had refractory C. parapsilosis septicemia cured with caspofungin.
