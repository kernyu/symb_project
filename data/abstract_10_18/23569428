Nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) lead to viral suppression and undetectable hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA in some individuals infected with HBV, but the rate of virological rebound has been unknown in such patients. We examined the prevalence of virological rebound of HBV DNA among NA-treated patients with undetectable HBV DNA. We retrospectively analyzed 303 consecutive patients [158 entecavir (ETV)- and 145 lamivudine (LAM)-treated] who achieved HBV DNA negativity, defined as HBV DNA < 3.7 log IU/mL for at least 3 months. They were followed up and their features, including their rates of viral breakthrough, were determined. Viral rebound after HBV DNA negativity was not observed in the ETV-group. Viral rebound after HBV DNA negativity occurred in 38.7% of 62 HBe antigen-positive patients in the LAM-group. On multivariate analysis, age was an independent factor for viral breakthrough among these patients (P = 0.035). Viral rebound after HBV DNA negativity occurred in 29.1% of 79 HBe antigen-negative patients in the LAM-group. Differently from LAM, ETV could inhibit HBV replication once HBV DNA negativity was achieved. In contrast, LAM could not inhibit HBV replication even if HBV negativity was achieved in the early phase. Attention should be paid to these features in clinical practice.
