Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-drug resistance mutations (DRM) are increasingly reported in Africans failing their first antiretroviral regimen. The Phidisa II trial randomized treatment-naive participants to lopinavir/ritonavir or efavirenz with stavudine + lamivudine or zidovudine + didanosine. We report the prevalence of DRM in subjects who achieved HIV RNA <400 copies per milliliter at 6 months, but subsequently had 2 consecutive HIV RNA >1000 copies per milliliter. Sixty-eight participants fulfilled the inclusion criteria. nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-DRM were found in 17 of 36 (47.2%) efavirenz recipients, and M184V/I mutation in 14 of 40 (35.0%) lamivudine recipients. No protease inhibitor mutation was identified in 38 lopinavir/ritonavir recipients. This is one of the first studies in Africa confirming the paucity of protease inhibitor-associated DRM despite virologic failure.
