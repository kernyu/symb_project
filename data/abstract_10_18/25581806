BACKGROUND: Periodic etiological surveillance of sexually transmitted infection (STI) syndromes is required to validate treatment algorithms used to control STIs. However, such surveys have not been performed in Zimbabwe over the past decade. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was used to determine the prevalence of the key STI etiological agents causing male urethral discharge (MUD). Urethral swab specimens were collected for molecular analysis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolation from consenting men 18 years and older who presented with MUD to the 12 clinics in Harare, Zimbabwe, between November 2010 and May 2011. A validated in-house multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay was used to detect the presence of N. gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Mycoplasma genitalium. Gonococci were cultured on selective media, and antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined locally for ciprofloxacin, kanamycin, ceftriaxone, and cefixime using Etest strips, and minimum inhibitory concentrations were reported using defined breakpoints. RESULTS: Among 130 participants, N. gonorrhoeae was the most frequent pathogen detected (106; 82.8%), followed by C. trachomatis (15; 11.7%), M. genitalium (6; 4.7%), and T. vaginalis (2; 1.6%). Four (6.1%) of the 66 gonococci isolated were resistant to fluoroquinolones, whereas all viable isolates were susceptible to kanamycin, cefixime, and ceftriaxone. CONCLUSIONS: Gonorrhea is the most important cause of MUD in men in Harare, and our study highlights the emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae. Further STI surveys are required in other regions of Zimbabwe to obtain a nationally representative picture of gonococcal burden and antimicrobial resistance among MUD patients.
