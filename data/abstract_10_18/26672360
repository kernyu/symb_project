As an important aminoglycosides antibiotic, gentamicin has been used clinically over decades. With the development in modern biological technology, the mechanisms of gentamicin action and resistance, its biosynthesis and structural modification were studied in great depth. Meanwhile, its emerging novel bioactivities and potential applications are also under extensive exploration. Here we summarize the latest progresses and prospects towards the future development of gentamicin for more efficient and effective uses.
