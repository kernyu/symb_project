Using the enzymatic transglycosylation reaction beta-d-ribo- and 2'-deoxyribofuranosides of 2-amino-5,6-difluorobenzimidazole nucleosides have been synthesized. 2-Amino-5,6-difluoro-benzimidazole riboside proved to exhibit a selective antiviral activity (selectivity index >32) against a wild strain of the herpes simplex virus type 1, as well as towards virus strains that are resistant to acyclovir, cidofovir, and foscarnet. We believe that this compound might be used for treatment of herpes infections in those cases, when acyclovir is not efficient.
