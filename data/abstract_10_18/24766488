Efflux pumps are membrane proteins involved in the active extrusion of a wide range of structurally dissimilar substrates from cells. A multidrug efflux pump named TetA belonging to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of transporters was identified in the Streptococcus thermophilus DSM 20617(T) genome. The tetA-like gene was found in the genomes of a number of S. thermophilus strains sequenced to date and in Streptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198, suggesting a possible horizontal gene transfer event between these two Streptococcus species, which are both adapted to the milk environment. Flow cytometry (single-cell) analysis revealed bistable TetA activity in the S. thermophilus population, and tetA-like gene over-expression resulted in a reduced susceptibility to ethidium bromide, tetracycline, and other toxic compounds even when the efflux pump was over-expressed in a strain naturally lacking tetA-like gene.
