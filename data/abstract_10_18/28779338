One of the reasons for increased antibiotic resistance in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi Ty2 is the influx of heavy metal ions in the sewage, from where the infection is transmitted. Therefore, curbing these selective agents could be one of the strategies to manage the emergence of multidrug resistance in the pathogen. As observed in our earlier study, the present study also confirmed the links between cadmium accumulation and antibiotic resistance in Salmonella. Therefore, the potential of a chemically-synthesised compound 2, 2'-dipyridyl diselane (DPDS) was explored to combat the metal-induced antibiotic resistance. Its metal chelating and antimicrobial properties were evidenced by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and microbroth dilution method. Owing to these properties of DPDS, further, this compound was evaluated for its potential to be used in combination with conventional antibiotics. The data revealed effective synergism at much lower concentrations of both the agents. Thus, it is indicated from the study that the combination of these two agents at their lower effective doses might reduce the chances of emergence of antibiotic resistance, which can be ascribed to the multi-pronged action of the agents.
