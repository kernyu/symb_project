The burden of community-associated methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is on the rise in population and clinical settings on account of the adaptability and virulence traits of this pathogen. We characterized 45 non-duplicate CA-MRSA strains implicated mainly in skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) in a tertiary care hospital in Mysore, South India. All the isolates were genotyped by staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing, staphylococcal protein A (spa) typing, accessory gene regulator (agr) typing, and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). Four sequence types (STs) belonging to three major clonal complexes (CCs) were identified among the isolates: CC22 (ST2371 and ST22), CC1 (ST772) and CC8 (ST8). The majority (53.3%) of the isolates was of the genotype ST2371-t852-SCCmec IV [sequence type-spa type-SCCmec type], followed by ST22-t852-SCCmec IV (22.2%), ST772-t657-SCCmec V (13.3%) and ST8-t008-SCCmec IV (11.1%). ST237I, a single locus variant of ST22 (EMRSA-15 clone), has not been reported previously from any of the Asian countries. Our study also documents for the first time, the appearance of ST8-SCCmec IV (USA300) strains in India. Representative strains of the STs were further analyzed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). agr typing detected type I or II alleles in the majority of the isolates. All the isolates were positive for the leukotoxin gene, pvl (Panton-Valentine leukocidin) and the staphylococcal enterotoxin gene cluster, egc. Interestingly, multidrug resistance (resistance to 3 classes of non-beta-lactam antibiotics) was observed in 77.8% (n=35) of the isolates. The highest (75.5%) resistance was recorded for ciprofloxacin, followed by erythromycin (53.3%), and quinupristin-dalfopristin (51.1%). Inducible clindamycin-resistance was identified in 37.7% of the isolates and it was attributed to the presence of erm(A), erm(C) and a combination of erm(A) and erm(C) genes. Isolates which showed a phenotypic pattern of M(R)/L(S) (macrolide-resistance/lincosamide-sensitivity) harbored the msr(A) gene. In conclusion, we report a high rate of multidrug resistance among Indian strains of CA-MRSA and the emergence of the lineages ST2371 and ST8 in India.
