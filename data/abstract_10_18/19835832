Plasmodium vivax is the second most important cause of morbidity in Ethiopia. There is, however, little information on P. vivax resistance to chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment although these drugs have been used as the first line treatment for over 50 years. We assessed the efficacy of standard chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment for P. vivax infections in a randomized open-label comparative study in Debre Zeit and Nazareth in East Shoa, Ethiopia. A total of 290 patients with microscopically confirmed P. vivax malaria who presented to the outpatient settings of the two laboratory centers were enrolled: 145 patients were randomized to receive CQ and 145 to receive CQ+PQ treatment. Participants were followed-up for 28-157 days according to the WHO procedures. There were 12 (6.5%) lost to follow-up patients and 9 (3.1%) withdrawals. In all, 96% (277/290) of patients were analysed at day 28. Baseline characteristics were similar in all treatment groups. In all, 98.6% (275/277) of patients had cleared their parasitemia on day 3 with no difference in mean parasite clearance time between regimens (48.34+/-17.68, 50.67+/-15.70 h for the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively, P=0.25). The cumulative incidence of therapeutic failure at day 28 by a life-table analysis method was 5.76% (95% CI: 2.2-14.61) and 0.75% (95% CI: 0.11-5.2%) in the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively (P=0.19). The relapse rate was 8% (9/108) for the CQ group and 3% (4/132) for the comparison group (P=0.07). The cumulative risk of relapse at day 157 by a life-table method was 61.8% (95% CI: 20.1-98.4%) in the CQ group, compared with 26.3% (95% CI: 7.5-29.4%) in the CQ+PQ group (P=0.0038). The study confirms the emergence of CQ and PQ resistance/treatment failure in P. vivax malaria in Ethiopia. Although treatment failures were detected, they were similar between the treatment groups. We recommend regular monitoring and periodic evaluation of the efficacy of these antimalarial drugs in systematically selected sentinel sites to detect further development of resistance and to make timely national antimalarial drug policy changes.
