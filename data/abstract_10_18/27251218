As an ancient disease, tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health threat. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an effective and safe anti-TB vaccine. In the current study, a delivery system of Fc domain of mouse IgG2a and early secreted antigenic target protein 6 (ESAT-6) was evaluated for the selective uptake of antigens by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Thus, it was based on the immunogenicity of a fusion protein. The study was initiated by the transfer of recombinant expression vectors of pPICZalphaA-ESAT-6:Fcgamma2a and pPICZalphaA-ESAT-6: His into Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris). Recombinant proteins were assessed for immunogenicity following the immunoblotting analysis. High levels of IFN-gamma and IL-12 were produced to induce Th1-type cellular responses through vaccination with both recombinant proteins [ESAT-6:Fcgamma2a (EF) and ESAT-6:His (EH)]. The Fc-tagged recombinant protein induced more effective Th1-type cellular responses with a low increment in IL-4 compared to PBS, BCG, and EH groups. Although in all the immunized groups, the ratio of IFN-gamma/IL-4 was in favor of Th1 responses, the highest Th1/Th2 balance was observed in EF immunized group. Fc fragment of mouse IgG2a may induce a selective uptake of APCs towards the cross-presentation and formation of Th1 responses in favor of an appropriate protective anti-tuberculosis reaction. Thus, further research on Fc-fusion proteins is required to develop Fc-based TB vaccines.
