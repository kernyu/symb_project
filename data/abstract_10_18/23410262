A total of 123 Shigella isolates were collected from SiXian area in Anhui, China. Screening was carried out by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) determinants. Different beta-blactamases genes, plasmid-borne bla(AmpC), 16S rRNA methylase genes, integrons, and mutations in quinolone resistance-determining regions were analysed by PCR for the PMQR-positive isolates.
