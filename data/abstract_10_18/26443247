BACKGROUND: The worldwide emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria in recent years has caused many problems for hospitals and patients, especially intensive care unit patients. Among these clinically important MDR bacteria are Acinetobacter baumannii complex species (A. baumannii, Acinetobacter genomic species 3 and Acinetobacter genomic species 13TU) that cause a wide range of infections. METHODS: The sequencing and bioinformatics analysis of a part of the Zone 1 of rpoB gene was performed for species identification of Acinetobacter isolates obtained from ICU patients with infected burns hospitalized in a hospital in Isfahan, Iran, over a 9-month period. Antibiotic sensitivity of Acinetobacter isolates was investigated using the disk diffusion method and different classes of antibiotics including amikacin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, imipenem and piperacillin. RESULTS: Acinetobacter spp. were isolated from 10 of 80 (12.5%) investigated patients. All of the 10 Acinetobacter isolates were identified as Acinetobacter baumannii and multi-drug resistant according to antibiotic susceptibility tests. CONCLUSION: Of the Acinetobacter baumannii complex members, only A. baumannii species was identified among the isolates obtained from patients with infected burns in an Isfahan hospital over a 9-month period.
