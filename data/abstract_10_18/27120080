Antibiotics are routinely used in modern livestock farming. The manure from medicated animals is used for the fertilization of arable crops, which in turn leads to the accumulation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment. This is a potentially serious public health issue, yet the identities of the bacterial taxa involved in ARG persistence are as yet undetermined. Using soil-manure microcosm experiments, we investigated the relationship between (i) the persistence of diverse ARGs and (ii) the dynamics of bacterial community members. We were able to identify, for the first time, the bacterial taxa involved in ARG enrichment in manured soils. They were gut-associated Clostridium species, and environmental species of Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas genera, all of them closely related to important nosocomial pathogens. Our data provide new clues on the routes by which ARGs may spread from farms to medical clinics.
