Due to the rapidly growing bacterial antibiotic-resistance and the scarcity of novel agents in development, bacterial infection is still a global problem. Therefore, new types of antibacterial agents, which are effective both alone and in combination with traditional antibiotics, are urgently needed. In this paper, a series of antibacterial ocotillol-type C-24 epimers modified from natural 20(S)-protopanaxadiol were synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial activity. According to the screening results of Gram-positive bacteria (B. subtilis 168 and MRSA USA300) and Gram-negative bacteria (P. aer PAO1 and A. baum ATCC19606) in vitro, the derivatives exhibited good antibacterial activity, particularly against Gram-positive bacteria with an minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) value of 2-16 microg/mL. The subsequent synergistic antibacterial assay showed that derivatives 5c and 6c enhanced the susceptibility of B. subtilis 168 and MRSA USA300 to chloramphenicol (CHL) and kanamycin (KAN) (FICI < 0.5). Our data showed that ocotillol-type derivatives with long-chain amino acid substituents at C-3 were good leads against antibiotic-resistant pathogens MRSA USA300, which could improve the ability of KAN and CHL to exhibit antibacterial activity at much lower concentrations with reduced toxicity.
