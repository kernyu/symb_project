We characterised by pyrosequencing, the dynamics of cytomegalovirus populations harbouring mutations A594V in gene UL97 and A834P and Q578H in gene UL54 in a haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipient. Unexpected re-emergence of A594V and decrease of A834P under CMX001 were shown to depend on both the selection pressure exerted by the antiviral treatments and the immune response.
