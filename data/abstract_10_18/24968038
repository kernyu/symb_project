INTRODUCTION: Preventing healthcare associated infections, especially for resistant microorganisms, is a priority. In Colombia, the surveillance of such events was started through a national pilot study. OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiology of device-associated infections, bacterial resistance and antibiotic consumption patterns in institutions with intensive care units (ICU), 2011. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Descriptive observational study in 10 health institutions from three Colombian provinces: Antioquia, Valle del Cauca, and Bogota. Surveillance protocols were designed and implemented by trained health professionals in each hospital. A web tool was designed for data reporting and analysis. Infection rates, device-use percentages and antibiotics defined daily dose (DDD) were calculated. Bacterial resistance phenotypes and profiles were reported and analyzed using Whonet 5.6. RESULTS: The most common event was bloodstream infection (rate > 4.8/1000 catheter-days) followed by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related urinary tract infection, showing a wide variability among institutions. A high consumption of meropenem in the ICU (DDD 22.5/100 beds-day) was observed, as well as a high carbapenem resistance (> 11.6%) and a high frequency of third generation cephalosporins resistance (> 25.6%) in Enterobacteriaceae in ICUs and hospitalization wards. The percentage of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was higher in hospitalization wards (34.3%). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first experience in measuring these events in Colombia. It is necessary to implement a national surveillance system aimed at guiding governmental and institutional actions oriented to infection prevention and control, to resistance management and to the promotion of antibiotics rational use, along with a follow-up and monitoring process.
