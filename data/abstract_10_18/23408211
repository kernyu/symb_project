Macrolides are widely used at low dosage for long-term therapy of chronic sinusitis. Twenty clinical macrolide-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains were morphologically compared with 10 clinical macrolide-sensitive strains. PCR amplification was performed to determine the presence of four known macrolide resistance genes. Transmission electron microscopy revealed significantly thicker cell walls in clinical macrolide-resistant strains. Even though the ultrastructural characteristics were shared by all macrolide-resistant strains, they were not associated with the presence or absence of the known macrolide-resistance genes. We also demonstrated that macrolide-resistant mutant strains derived in vitro from a macrolide-sensitive parent strain had thickened cell walls and did not harbor the known macrolide-resistance genes. These results, therefore, revealed that macrolide-resistant S. aureus strains have thickened cell walls as a common ultrastructural characteristic and that cell wall thickening is likely mediated by an unknown gene which is unrelated to any known macrolide resistance gene.
