Acute myeloid leukemia is a clonal but heterogeneous disease differing in molecular pathogenesis, clinical features and response to chemotherapy. This latter frequently consists of a combination of cytarabine and anthracyclines, although etoposide, demethylating agents, and other drugs are also used. Unfortunately, chemoresistance is a common and serious problem. Multiple mechanisms account for impaired effectiveness of drugs and reduced levels of active agents in target cells. The latter can be due to lower drug uptake, increased export or decreased intracellular proportion of active/inactive agent due to changes in the expression/function of enzymes responsible for the activation of pro-drugs and the inactivation of active agents. Characterization of the "resistome", or profile of expressed genes accounting for multi-drug resistance (MDR) phenotype, would permit to predict the lack of response to chemotherapy and would help in the selection of the best pharmacological regime for each patient and moment, and to develop strategies of chemosensitization.
