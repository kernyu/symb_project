INTRODUCTION: The proportion of HIV-infected patients with overweight/obesity has increased in recent years. These patients have an increased metabolic/cardiovascular risk compared with non-obese patients. Modulation of gut microbiota composition arises as a promising tool to prevent the development of obesity and associated disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the impacts of maraviroc (MVC), a CCR5 antagonist approved for clinical use in HIV-infected patients, on gut microbiota composition in a mouse model of obesity. METHODS: Thirty two male C57BL/6 mice were assigned to:a) Control (chow diet), b) MVC (chow diet plus 300 mg/L MVC), c) High-fat diet (HFD) or d) HFD/MVC (HFD plus 300 mg/L MVC) groups. Body weight and food intake was recorded every 2-3 days. Mice were euthanized after 16 weeks of treatment and cecal contents were removed to analyse by real-time PCR four bacterial orders from the most dominant phyla in gut. RESULTS: Mice fed with a HFD showed a significant increase in Enterobacteriales (p<0.001 vs. control). MVC treatment induced a significant decrease in control (p<0.05) and HFD fed mice (p<0.001). Interestingly, this order was positively associated with body weight gain, insulin resistance and fatty liver. HFD induced a significant decrease in Bacteroidales and Clostridiales levels (p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively). MVC decreased the presence of Bacteroidales (p<0.05 vs. control) while an increase was observed in HFD/MVC mice (p=0.01 vs. HFD). No direct effects of MVC were observed on Clostridiales and Lactobacillales. CONCLUSIONS: MVC may constitute a new therapeutic option to prevent obesity and related disorders in HIV-infected patients.
