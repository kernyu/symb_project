Bioleaching combined with Fenton-like oxidation was used to condition sewage sludge. The results showed that it took approximately 1 d to decrease pH from 6.9 to 2.5 by bioleaching, with fixed sulfur power and FeSO4 x 7H2O dosages of 3 g x L(-1) and 8 g x L(-1), respectively. After bioleaching, the volatile solids(VS) reduction was 13.4%, and the specific resistance to filtration(SRF) dropped from 3.1 x 10(9)s2 x g(-1) to 1.5 x 10(9)s2 x g(-1) with a reduction of 51.6%, but the bioleached sludge was still difficult to be dewatered. The bioleached sludge was further oxidized by Fenton-like oxidation. The results indicated that the optimal H2O2 dosage and reaction time were 3.3 g x L(-1) and 60 min, respectively. Under the optimal conditions, VS reduction was 30.8%, SRF was declined to 1.9 x 10(8) s2 x g(-1) with a reduction of 93.9%, and the moisture of sludge cake was 76.9%. After treated by bioleaching combined with Fenton-like oxidation, the dewaterability and stability of sewage sludge were significantly improved. Besides, the combined technology was more efficient in conditioning sewage sludge than single Fenton-like oxidation.
