This study describes the molecular characterization of an NDM-7 carbapenemase-producing Escherichia coli strain Ec188, recovered from a rectal swab of a male patient who had travelled to Pakistan before his hospitalization at the Hospital del Mar in Barcelona, Spain. The Ec188 isolate, assigned to a new multilocus sequence type ST679, was resistant to all beta-lactams, aminoglycosides (gentamicin, tobramycin, and with reduced susceptibility to amikacin), and ciprofloxacin. The blaNDM-7 gene was located on a 50 kb IncX4 plasmid (pEc188-NDM7), both in the original and transconjugant strains. In addition, blaCTX-M-15 was located on a 150 kb IncFIA plasmid and blaCMY-2 on a 95 kb undetermined plasmid type, only in the wild-type strain. The immediate genetic surroundings of blaNDM-7 included the bleo, trpf, and dsbC genes, and it was flanked by the insertion sequences IS26 and ISAba125, which appeared interrupted by IS5. The res and parA genes were found in the same orientation downstream of the IS26 element. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an NDM-7-carbapenemase carried on an IncX4 plasmid, as well as the first E. coli strain belonging to ST679 harboring an NDM beta-lactamase, possibly associated with previous travel to Pakistan. In addition, this study highlights the dissemination of NDM variants accompanied by IncX-type plasmids.
