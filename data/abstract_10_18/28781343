Day-old chicks from 3 hatcheries were placed on bedding paper and brought to a commercial broiler farm between January and July 2016. Sixty-six samples of the paper, which were stained with meconium droppings of the chicks, were collected and examined for isolation of cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. Cefotaxime (CTX)-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (1 isolate) and Enterobacter cloacae (4 isolates) were isolated from 5 (7.58%) of the 66 samples. Conjugation experiments revealed that the blaCTX-M-25 gene conferring CTX resistance was transferred from the K. pneumoniae isolate and 2 of the 4 E. cloacae isolates to Escherichia coli DH5alpha via IncA/C plasmids carrying the gene. Our results suggested that the blaCTX-M-25 gene originating from chicks may be spread among commercial broiler farms.
