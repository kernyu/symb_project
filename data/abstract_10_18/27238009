Haemonchus contortus has shown a great ability to develop resistance to anthelmintic drugs. In many instances, resistance has appeared less than 10years after the introduction of a new drug class. Field populations of this species now show resistance to all major anthelmintic drug classes, including benzimidazoles (BZs), imidazothiazoles and macrocyclic lactones. In addition, resistance to the recently introduced amino-acetonitrile derivative class (monepantel) has already been reported. The existence of field populations showing resistance to all three major drug classes, and the early appearance of resistance to monepantel, threatens the sustainability of sheep and goat production systems worldwide. This chapter reviews the history of the development of resistance to the various anthelmintics in H. contortus and examines the mechanisms utilized by this species to resist the effects of these drugs. Some of these mechanisms are well understood, particularly for BZ drugs, while our knowledge and understanding of others are increasing. Finally, we summarize methods available for the diagnosis of resistance. While such diagnosis currently relies largely on the faecal egg count reduction test, which suffers from issues of expense and sensitivity, we describe past and current efforts to utilize cheaper and less laborious phenotypic assays with free-living life stages, and then describe progress on the development of molecular assays to provide sensitive resistance-detection tests.
