INTRODUCTION: Community acquired pneumonia is one of the main infections, remaining as a global cause of considerable morbidity and mortality. Successful treatment hinges on expedient delivery of appropriate antibiotic therapy tailored to both the likely pathogens and the severity of disease. Although antibiotic resistance is increasing and pharmaceutical companies continue to debate the profitability of introducing new antibacterial agents, an encouraging number of new molecules have recently been unveiled which target multidrug-resistant bacteria. Areas covered: Herein, the authors summarize the actual situation of novel antibiotics for CAP in phase I & II of development. For each set of compounds, the medical significance and possible clinical placement are discussed. Current treatment options from the most important international guidelines are also reviewed. Expert opinion: Our review shows that the new antibiotics in the pipeline belong to existing antibiotic classes as beta-lactams, macrolides, quinolones, oxazolidinones, tetracyclines, lipoglycopeptides, and cyclic lipopeptides and a few with a narrow spectrum of activity are novel compounds directed against novel targets. With rising outpatient antibiotic resistance in pneumonia, some of the compounds discussed are being considered for more rapid advancement in the pipeline, helping to increase the number of agents in later stages of development.
