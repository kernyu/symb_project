Salmonella enterica is a pathogen of significant public health importance that is frequently associated with foodborne illness. We report the whole-genome sequences of four multidrug-resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi B and Heidelberg strains, isolated from the Colombian poultry chain. The isolates contain a variety of antimicrobial resistance genes for aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, sulfonamides, tetracycline, and trimethoprim.
