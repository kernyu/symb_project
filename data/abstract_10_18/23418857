BACKGROUND: The resistance of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) to antibiotics is increasing worldwide, lowering its efficacy in current eradication therapies. This study evaluated H. pylori resistance to antibiotics in the southeast coastal region of China and suggests appropriate alternatives. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventeen thousand seven hundred and thirty one H. pylori strains were collected from eight areas of two provinces in coastal southeast China from 2010 to 2012. The resistance of these strains to six antibiotics was tested using the agar dilution method. RESULTS: The resistance rates to clarithromycin, metronidazole, levofloxacin, amoxicillin, gentamicin and furazolidone were 21.5, 95.4, 20.6, 0.1, 0.1 and 0.1%, respectively. Double, triple and quadruple antibacterial resistant percentages were 25.5, 7.5 and 0.1%, respectively. A positive association between the resistance to levofloxacin and to clarithromycin was found, but there was a negative correlation in the resistances to levofloxacin and to metronidazole. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of H. pylori resistance to clarithromycin, metronidazole, levofloxacin and multiple antibiotics in coastal southeast China is high. Choice of therapy should be individualized based on a susceptibility test in this region of the country.
