The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and transferability of resistance in tetracycline-resistant Escherichia coli isolates recovered from beef cattle in South Korea. A total of 155 E. coli isolates were collected from feces in South Korea, and 146 were confirmed to be resistant to tetracycline. The tetracycline resistance gene tet(A) (46.5%) was the most prevalent, followed by tet(B) (45.1%) and tet(C) (5.8%). Strains carrying tet(A) plus tet(B) and tet(B) plus tet(C) were detected in two isolates each. In terms of phylogenetic grouping, 101 (65.2%) isolates were classified as phylogenetic group B1, followed in decreasing order by D (17.4%), A (14.2%), and B2 (3.2%). Ninety-one (62.3%) isolates were determined to be multidrug resistant by the disk diffusion method. MIC testing using the principal tetracyclines, namely, tetracycline, chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline, doxycycline, and minocycline, revealed that isolates carrying tet(B) had higher MIC values than isolates carrying tet(A). Conjugation assays showed that 121 (82.9%) isolates could transfer a tetracycline resistance gene to a recipient via the IncFIB replicon (65.1%). This study suggests that the high prevalence of tetracycline-resistant E. coli isolates in beef cattle is due to the transferability of tetracycline resistance genes between E. coli populations which have survived the selective pressure caused by the use of antimicrobial agents.
