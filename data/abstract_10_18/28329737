AIMS: This work investigated the relative strengths of different blaSHV promoter-associated sequences and their regulation function in blaSHV expression and beta-lactam resistance. METHODS: Recombinant plasmids with the promoter-associated sequences (P-W, P-S, P-IS, and P-WPD), tac promoter, and combined fragments of promoter and blaSHV were separately constructed and transformed into Escherichia coli DH5alpha. The relative strengths of the promoters indicated by the intensities of green fluorescent protein and the mRNA expression levels of blaSHV were compared. The minimum inhibitory concentration and extended spectrum beta-lactamase phenotypes were evaluated. RESULTS: The relative strengths were ranked as P-tac > P-WPD > P-IS > P-S > P-W. The mRNA expression and beta-lactam resistance levels of the different promoter-associated sequence groups were generally consistent with the strength rank, but the extent of gfp and blaSHV mRNA levels varied significantly in each group. The beta-lactam resistance levels were inconsistent with the strength rank in certain blaSHV groups. In relation to the different promoter-associated sequences, blaSHV-ESBLs displayed significantly different change modes of beta-lactam resistance compared with blaSHV-non-ESBLs. CONCLUSION: The mRNA expression and beta-lactam resistance of the blaSHV showed consistencies and inconsistencies with the strengths of the promoter-associated sequences. The mechanisms accounting for these discrepancies need further investigation.
