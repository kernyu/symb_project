We report on the possibility of obtaining organic polymeric matrixes allowing the development of new high performance fire-resistant products by recycling downsized thermostable waste materials. Phenolic resins have been used as binders for recycled waste. Furthermore, considering that reinforced plastic triturations have superior properties (chemical, mechanical, water resistance, etc.) to wood agglomerates, significant advantages over conventional materials are anticipated. In summary, we propose a viable solution to some of the known problems caused by the consumption of wood and to the needs of strengthened plastic processing engineering. Using resins as a binder, several fire-resistant prototypes were prepared from polyester waste, and their mechanical properties, thermal stability, and fire-resistant properties were analyzed.
