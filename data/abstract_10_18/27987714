The novel Ti-20Zr-5Ta-2Ag alloy was characterised concerning its microstructure, morphology, mechanical properties, its passive film composition and thickness, its long-term electrochemical stability, corrosion resistance, ion release rate in Ringer solution of acid, neutral and alkaline pH values and antibacterial activity. The new alloy has a crystalline alpha microstructure (by XRD). Long-term XPS and SEM analyses show the thickening of the passive film and the deposition of hydroxyapatite in neutral and alkaline Ringer solution. The values of the electrochemical parameters confirm the over time stability of the new alloy passive film. All corrosion parameters have very favourable values in time which attest a high resistance to corrosion. Impedance spectra evinced a bi-layered passive film formed by the barrier, insulating layer and the porous layer. The monitoring of the open circuit potentials indicated the stability of the protective layers and their thickening in time. The new alloy releases (by ICP-MS measurements) very low quantities of Ti, Zr, Ag ions and no Ta ions. The new alloy exhibits a low antibacterial activity.
