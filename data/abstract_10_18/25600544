BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of mortality after kidney transplantation. According to guidelines, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) must be given as preventive antiplatelet therapy, but resistance to this drug is also well-known. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 214 renal transplant patients were included in our study and took 100 mg of ASA q.d. Aggregometry was performed to determine resistance. Twenty-four variables were examined using logistic regression analysis as possible causes of resistance. RESULTS: ASA resistance was observed in 40.18% of the patients. Resistance reduced concomitant statin therapy and significantly increased simultaneous cyclosporine therapy. CONCLUSION: Our study assessed the post-transplant ASA resistance in a large population. Clarification of this matter is crutial, since one of the major preventive pharmacological therapies of cardiovascular mortality is not effective in a significant number of patients.
