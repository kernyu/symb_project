Changes in the antimicrobial susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae causing otitis media were studied in 916 isolates from children <5 years old between 1999 and 2010 in a region of northern Spain. The rate of antimicrobial resistance decreased between the period before the introduction of the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (from 1999 to 2001) and the period from 2005 to 2007. However, in 2008 to 2010, resistance rates increased again due to the spread of serotype 19A, especially the multidrug-resistant ST320 and ST276 clones.
