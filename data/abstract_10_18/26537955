BACKGROUND: Recent publications suggest the distribution of Candida species causing candiduria may vary geographically, which has implications for the continued efficacy of antifungal therapy and emerging resistance. AIM: To investigate the incidence of Candiduria at a university hospital in the UK. Further, to assess the distribution of species and the accompanying antifungal susceptibility profile, in order to monitor the clinical utility of current antifungal treatment guidelines for candiduria so that patients receive the best possible outcomes from the most up to date care. DESIGN: Retrospective audit. METHODS: From 1st January 2005 to 31st October 2014, we retrospectively reviewed 37 538 positive urine cultures recorded in a computerized laboratory results database. Identification and susceptibility testing was performed using the VITEK(R) 2 fungal susceptibility card (bioMerieux, Marcy d'Etoile, France). RESULTS: In total, 96 cultures were positive for Candida species, of which 69 (72%) were C.albicans, which translates to a prevalence of 2.6 per 1000 positive urine cultures. Candiduria was more common in younger patients, males and catheterized females. We report 94 and 73% of isolates of C.albicans and other non-C.albicans Candida species were susceptible to fluconazole. All isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B. CONCLUSIONS: Our results add weight to the evidence supporting current European and North American guidelines recommending fluconazole or amphotericin B for treatment of candiduria, if antifungal treatment is clinically indicated.
