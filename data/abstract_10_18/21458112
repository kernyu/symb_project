Following our search for antimalarial compounds, novel series of ferrocenyl-substituted pyrrolo[1,2-a]quinoxalines 1-2 were synthesized from ferrocene-carboxaldehyde and tested for their in vitro activity upon the erythrocytic development of Plasmodium falciparum strains with different chloroquine-resistance status. The ferrocenic pyrrolo[1,2-a]quinoxalines 1-2 were prepared in 6 or 9 steps through a Barton-Zard reaction. Promising pharmacological results against FcB1, K1 and F32 strains were obtained with ferrocenyl pyrrolo[1,2-a]quinoxalines 1j-l linked by a bis-(3-aminopropyl)piperazine linker substituted by a nitrobenzyl moiety.
