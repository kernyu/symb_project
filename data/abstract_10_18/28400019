Salmonella enterica is a well-known pathogen commonly acquired from the consumption of contaminated food. It has been estimated to affect millions of humans and cause hundreds of thousands of deaths per year globally. Pork, one of the most commonly consumed meats worldwide, has been identified as one of the main sources of human salmonellosis. In this study, we aimed to detect and characterize S. enterica from slaughtered swine and generate antimicrobial resistance profiles of select isolates. Tonsils and jejunum with mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) were collected from a total of 240 swine from eight abattoirs (five accredited and three locally registered abattoirs) across Metro Manila. S. enterica were isolated using conventional culture methods and confirmed by PCR amplification of the invA gene. Isolates were further characterized based on somatic antigen by multiplex PCR. We report that there is no significant difference (P = 0.42) between the incidences of S. enterica in swine slaughtered in accredited (44.0%) and in locally registered abattoirs (46.7%). Most samples were contaminated with S. enterica under serogroup O:3,10. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 183 isolates using the VITEK((R)) 2 system revealed high resistance to ampicillin (67.8%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (80.3%). Multidrug-resistance was found in 124 (67.8%) isolates.
