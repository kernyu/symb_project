The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of cephalosporin-resistant Escherichia coli at the different levels of the Norwegian broiler production pyramid and identify the mechanisms responsible for the resistance phenotype. Samples from all levels of the broiler production pyramid and retail chicken meat (fillets) were included (n=649). The occurrence of cephalosporin-resistant E. coli at the different production levels ranged from 8 to 43%. All these isolates had an AmpC-phenotype, and the majority carried the blaCMY-2 gene. In addition, a few isolates with up-regulated chromosomal ampC were identified. The results show that Norway has a relatively high prevalence of cephalosporin-resistant E. coli in the broiler production chain in spite of a very low consumption of antimicrobial agents. Cephalosporins have not been used in the Norwegian broiler production, and it has been hypothesised that import of breeding animals and hatching eggs may be the source of these resistant bacteria. We demonstrate that these bacteria are disseminated in the production pyramid despite the lack of selection pressure from antimicrobial agents.
