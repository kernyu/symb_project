This study was aimed to investigate the molecular epidemiology, mechanism of carbapenem resistance, and occurrence of class 1 integrons among 13 carbapenem-resistant clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii obtained between 2004 and 2007 from Sweden. Nine isolates were linked with hospitalization abroad. Molecular epidemiology was investigated by multilocus sequence typing, multiplex PCRs for major international clones/sequence groups (SGs), and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. OXA-carbapenemase genes/genetic surroundings and class 1 integrons were examined by PCRs and sequencing. The isolates belonged to sequence type (ST) 2/international clone II (n=6), ST23/SG5 (n=2), ST25 (n=2), ST5/SG7 (n=1), and ST109 (n=2). OXA-58, OXA-23, and OXA-24 were detected in seven, five, and one isolate, respectively. Different genetic structures surrounded the bla(OXA-58-like) and bla(OXA-23-like) genes. Interestingly, ISAba825 was detected upstream bla(OXA-58-like) in two isolates. Class 1 integrons with three different variable regions (VR) were detected. VR1 (aacA4-orfO-bla(OXA-20)) was found in four isolates from ST2/international clone II, with three of them imported from Greece. VR2 (aadB-aadA1-IS) was detected in one ST5 isolate imported from Poland, and VR3 (bla(GES-11)-aacA4-dfrA7) was present in a nonimport ST25 isolate. In conclusion, a variety of clonal lineages, OXA-carbapenemases genes and genetic structures, and class 1 integrons were detected among carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii from Sweden.
