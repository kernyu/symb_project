Acinetobacter baumannii is an important nosocomial pathogen which causes a wide range of infections. In this study, we addressed the role of class 1 integron, ISAba1 and ISAba125 associated with antimicrobial resistance in 72 clinical isolates of A. baumannii collected from clinical settings in Tehran, Iran. Moreover, to study the clonal relatedness of strains, repetitive extragenic palindromic-PCR (rep-PCR) assay was carried out. PCR revealed that blaOXA-51-like, blaOXA-23-like, blaOXA-24/40-like, blaOXA-58-like, blaNDM, integrase gene (intI1), ISAba1, and ISAba125 were present in 86.11% (62/72), 84.72% (61/72), 30.55% (22/72), 0% (0/72), 0% (0/72), 58.33% (42/72), 97.22% (70/72), and 65.27% (47/72) of the strains, respectively. Sequencing of 39 internal variable regions of class 1 integrons showed seven gene cassette arrays, including aadA4-catB8-aadA1 (2.77%), aadA1-aadA4 (1.38%), aacC4-aadA1 (2.77%), aacC4 (22.22%), aadA1 (13.88%), aadA4 (5.55%), and catB8 (5.55%). We detected ISAba1 in the upstream of blaOXA-23-like, blaOXA-51-like, and blaADC in 54.16% (39/72), 9.72% (7/72), and 56.94% (41/72) of the strains, respectively. Whereas, there was a low frequency of disruptions in carO and dacD genes: 5.55% (4/72) and 4.16% (3/72). Rep-PCR analysis revealed that the isolates were genetically diverse. However, Cl-12 and Cl-15 were the largest clusters and they were recovered from various hospitals. Our analysis showed the high rates of class 1 integrons as a repertoire of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes. It seems that linkages of ISAba1-blaOXA-23-like and ISAba1-blaOXA-69, and disruptions in carO or dacD can develop resistance to carbapenems among clinical isolates of A. baumannii.
