Reference methods E.Def 7.1 and M27-A3 detect in vitro resistance; however, they are expensive and very laborious. Thus, their actual use in hospital laboratories is limited. There are commercial techniques available, having easier accessibility and development, which would yield results comparable to those of the reference methods. The objectives of this study were: a) to compare the results of minimal inhibitory concentration of 82 Candida spp. clinic isolates according to reference method E.Def 7.1 and ATB(R) Fungus 3; b) to compare the results of fluconazole susceptibility testing by disk diffusion in agar with Neo-SensitabsTM tablets and Malbran disks with those of the reference methods. Minimal inhibitory concentration for amphotericin B, 5-flucytosine, fluconazole and itraconazole was performed according to the E.Def 7.1 and the ATB Fungus 3 methods and diffusion was carried out with fluconazole disks and tablets. General concordance between the reference method and ATB Fungus 3 was 90.2 % and 96.3 and 92.7% for diffusion with disks and tablets. The ATB Fungus 3 method was effective to determine susceptibility against amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine; however, discrepancies were observed with azole drugs. Disk diffusion methods are useful to determine susceptibility to fluconazole; however, 3 very major, 1 major and 2 minor errors were observed with the tablets, whereas only 3 minor errors were observed with the disks.
