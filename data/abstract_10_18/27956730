Resurgence of Bordetella pertussis in recent years in the United States has coincided with a dramatic rise in pertactin-deficient strains. Limited data exist on detectability by nucleic acid amplification testing and antimicrobial susceptibility of pertactin-deficient B. pertussis. This study compares 15 pertactin-producing and 15 pertactin-deficient B. pertussis isolates. Pertactin-producing and pertactin-deficient strains were equally detected by nucleic acid amplification testing and were susceptible to antibiotics.
