A high prevalence of gonococcal resistance to various antimicrobials as well as Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates exhibiting resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins have been reported in the past few decades. A total of 226 N. gonorrhoeae isolates obtained from the National Taiwan University Hospital from 2001 to 2013 were evaluated. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the isolates to antimicrobials were determined by the agar dilution method and interpreted using the 2017 clinical breakpoints or epidemiological cut-off values recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST). The genetic relatedness of these isolates was determined by multilocus sequence typing. Among these isolates, none was resistant to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime, and the resistance rates to cefixime, spectinomycin, cefpodoxime, ciprofloxacin, and penicillin were 0.4 %, 0.4 %, 13.3 %, 91.6 %, and 87.6 %, respectively. The rate of isolates resistant to azithromycin was 14.6 % (EUCAST criteria), which were higher than those revealed by previous surveillance studies. A total of 57 sequence types (ST) were identified, and ST1901, ST7365, and ST1927 prevailed. Isolates of ST8143 emerged after 2011. ST1901 isolates had relatively higher MIC values for ceftriaxone and azithromycin than those of the other STs. In conclusion, ceftriaxone remains an effective drug of choice for gonorrhoeal management in Taiwan. High rates of azithromycin resistance among N. gonorrhoeae isolates was found. The circulating ST1901 strains with high MIC values for ceftriaxone and azithromycin and the emerging ST8143 strains were alarming.
