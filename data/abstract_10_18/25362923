The central nervous system is one of the locations of extrapulmonary tuberculosis with worse prognosis. The delay in diagnosis and treatment is one of the factors associated with higher mortality and sequelae. The "paradoxical reaction" is described as a variable degree of symptomatic deterioration during the effective treatment of tuberculosis. The increased resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to drugs observed in recent years generates greater concern about the emergence of a paradoxical reaction during treatment. The case of a child with tuberculous meningitis that after one month of treatment presented clinical worsening and new lesions in CT and MRI images of the brain is presented. Comorbidities were excluded, it was verified that taking drugs has been monitored, and the sensitivity of the bacillus to first-line antituberculosis drugs was confirmed. The patient required no change in the pattern of tuberculosis treatment and steroids were administered for symptomatic relief. The paradoxical reaction during antituberculosis treatment is rare and due to a hypersensitivity reaction between the host and the tuberculous bacillus. When it appears you must ensure the effectiveness and compliance of the treatment.
