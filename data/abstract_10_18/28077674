Objectives: To define the population structure of extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) in Japan and its relationship with antimicrobial resistance and the major resistance mechanisms for fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams, we designed a multicentre prospective study. Methods: A total of 329 ExPEC isolates were collected at 10 Japanese acute-care hospitals during December 2014. We defined the clonal groups of ExPEC by fumC and fimH sequencing (CH typing). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 18 agents and the detection of mutations in quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) and beta-lactamases were performed. Results: Among the study isolates, 103 CH types were found, and CH40-30 (25%) and another 10 CH types (35% in total) constituted the major ExPEC population. Ciprofloxacin non-susceptibility, ESBLs and MDR phenotypes were found in 34%, 22% and 33%, respectively. CH40-30, corresponding to the C/H30 clade of the global pandemic ST131 clone, was associated with four QRDR mutations (100%) and bla CTX-M (60%) and was the most frequent type in 15 antimicrobial-non-susceptible populations (dominating 39%-75% of each population, the highest prevalence for ciprofloxacin), the ESBL producers (70%) and the MDR isolates (59%). Isolates that were non-susceptible to nalidixic acid and low-level resistant to ciprofloxacin with one or two QRDR mutations represented 16% of the study isolates and were distributed among the eight major and non-major CH types. Conclusions: More than half of the ExPEC population in Japan consisted of 11 major clones. Of these clones, the CH40-30-ST131-C/H30 clone was the predominant antimicrobial-resistant population. The presence of major clones with low-level ciprofloxacin resistance supports the potential future success of a non-ST131 fluoroquinolone-resistant clone.
