The use of antimicrobial agents for additives or therapeutics is strongly associated with a prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in commensal Enterobacteriaceae. We aimed to characterize integrons in Enterobacteriaceae isolates obtained from chicken cecums in Korea. Moreover, the correlation between integron gene cassettes and antimicrobial resistance was also investigated. A total of 90 isolates the belonged to Enterobacteriaceae were recovered from chickens grown at Gyeongsang and Chungcheong provinces in Korea. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed by the disk diffusion method. PCR and DNA sequencing were also performed to characterize the gene cassette arrays of the integrons. Of the 90 Enterobacteriaceae isolates tested, 39 (43.3%) and 10 (11.1%) isolates carried class 1 and 2 integrons, respectively. Whereas the class 2 integron did not contain gene cassettes, the class 1 integrons carried seven different gene cassette arrays. The class 1 integrons harbored genes encoding resistant determinants to aminoglycosides (aadA1, aadA2, and aadA5), trimethoprim (dfrA1, dfrA12, dfrA17, and dfrA32), lincosamides (linF), and erythromycin (ereA). Moreover, the presence of a class 1 integron was significantly related to a high resistance rate of antimicrobial agents, such as spectinomycin and trimethoprim. We confirmed that diverse class 1 integrons were widely distributed in Enterobacteriaceae isolates from chickens and directly contributed to the resistance to diverse antimicrobial agents in Korea.
