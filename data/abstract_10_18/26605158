Staphylococcus aureus is a common nosocomial pathogen with property to develop resistance to antimicrobial agents. But in the modern era, drug resistance had been developed by microbes due to its continuous usage of antibiotics. This study was carried out to evaluate antibiotic resistant pattern of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) using molecular genotyping. In view of the present problem, the study has been conducted to detect the molecular genotyping of mecA gene from MRSA and confirmation of its restriction sites using EcoRI and BamHI. The pus samples were swabbed out, and clinical strains were isolated using standard microbiological procedures. Then the strains were subjected to in vitro antibiotic susceptibility assay and identified MRSA. Further molecular genotyping of mecA gene was determined by polymerase chain reaction technique. The percentage analysis was done. The clinical strains were isolated from the wound infected patients. A total of 60 samples were collected, of 60 samples, 40 (66.7%) were showed positive to strains of S. aureus. The in vitro antibiotic susceptibility assay was carried to find the drug sensitive and resistant patterns. Further methicillin resistant strains (35%) of S. aureus were screened and subjected to molecular genotyping of mecA gene and was confirmed by restriction digestion. Overall, 70% of plasmids show positive for the presence of mecA gene, although all strains have restriction sites. Hence, the present study revealed that the early detection of antibiotic resistant character using molecular genotyping will help the infected patient to cure short period and will reduce the development of multidrug resistance.
