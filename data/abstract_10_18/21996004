A study was conducted to evaluate the occurrence of resistance against, in particular, ivermectin in cyathostomins in the Netherlands. Seventy horse farms were visited between October 2007 and November 2009. In initial screening, faecal samples were collected 2 weeks after deworming with either ivermectin, moxidectin or doramectin. Pooled faecal samples from a maximum of 10 horses were examined for worm eggs using a modified McMaster technique and for worm larvae after faecal larval cultures. In total 931 horses were involved. On 15 of 70 farms eggs and/or larvae were found. On 8 of these 15 farms a FECRT with ivermectin was performed on 43 horses. Efficacy of ivermectin against cyathostomins of 93% was found in one animal on one farm. Additionally, the strategies and efforts of the horse owners to control cyathostomins, as well as risk factors for the development of macrocyclic lactone resistance were evaluated with a questionnaire. Strikingly, many responders indicated that the control of cyathostomins in horses is achieved through very frequent deworming. Fourteen percent of these owners deworm seven times per year or more. On 34% of the 70 farms treatment was repeated within the Egg Reappearance Period of a product.
