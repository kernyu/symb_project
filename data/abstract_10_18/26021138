Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is a Gram-negative germ, responsible for severe infections. PA infected chronic wounds are a clinically highly relevant topic. PA has a natural resistance to many antibiotics, and there is no consensus on a first-line antibiotic to be used. In the context of chronic ulcers with an unfavorable evolution, we suggest intravenous antibiotic therapy, ideally on an in-patient basis. Given the sparse evidence from clinical trials, we heavily rely on clinical experience when it comes to managing chronic ulcers infected with PA.
