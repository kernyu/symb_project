We report a case series of 11 patients with severe E. faecium infections treated with daptomycin. All strains were resistant to ampicillin (MIC >8 mg/l), but susceptible to vancomycin. Seven out of 11 strains were also highly resistant to gentamicin (MIC >500 mg/l). All patients were treated with multiple broad-spectrum antibiotics prior to isolation of E. faecium and had severe underlying diseases. Our experience suggests that salvage therapy with daptomycin might be a safe and efficacious treatment for E. faecium infections.
