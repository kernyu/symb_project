Objectives: To investigate the context of the ribosomal RNA methyltransferase gene armA in carbapenem-resistant global clone 2 (GC2) Acinetobacter baumannii isolates from Singapore. Methods: Antibiotic resistance was determined using disc diffusion; PCR was used to identify resistance genes. Whole genome sequences were determined and contigs were assembled and ordered using PCR. Resistance regions in unsequenced isolates were mapped. Results: Fifteen GC2 A. baumannii isolated at Singapore General Hospital over the period 2004-11 and found to carry the armA gene were resistant to carbapenems, third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and most aminoglycosides. In these isolates, the armA gene was located in a third chromosomal resistance island, previously designated AbGRI3. In four isolates, armA was in a 19 kb IS 26 -bounded transposon, designated Tn 6180 . In three of them, a 2.7 kb transposon carrying the aphA1b gene, designated Tn 6179 , was found adjacent to and sharing an IS 26 with Tn 6180. However, in these four isolates a 3.1 kb segment of the adjacent chromosomal DNA has been inverted by an IS 26 -mediated event. The remaining 11 isolates all contained a derivative of Tn 6180 that had lost part of the central segment and only one retained Tn 6179 . The chromosomal inversion was present in four of these and in seven the deletion extended beyond the inversion into adjacent chromosomal DNA. AbGRI3 forms were found in available GC2 sequences carrying armA. Conclusions: In GC2 A. baumannii , the armA gene is located in various forms of a third genomic resistance island named AbGRI3. An aphA1b transposon is variably present in AbGRI3.
