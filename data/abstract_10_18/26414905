Asunaprevir, a second-generation NS3 protease inhibitor of hepatitis C virus (HCV), exhibits strong antiviral activity against HCV genotypes 1 and 4, but relatively weak activity against genotypes 2 and 3. For chronic HCV infection, asunaprevir with daclatasvir as an interferon-free dual treatment achieves a sustained virologic response of nearly 90% in genotype 1b, and a triple regimen with beclabuvir achieves an sustained virologic response >90%. Asunaprevir and daclatasvir dual treatment can be safely and effectively administered to liver transplant recipients with recurrent HCV. The major drawback of asunaprevir is its low threshold to resistance, which can be overcome by combining it with other direct-acting antivirals. Further studies of asunaprevir in combination with other direct-acting antivirals for the treatment of patients with HCV genotypes 1 or 4 and renal impairment or end-stage renal disease under hemodialysis, HIV-coinfection and liver and/or kidney transplant recipients are warranted.
