UNLABELLED: Nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus may be responsible for some serious infections among hemodialyzed patients. Its pathogenic potential and commensal nature allows for an easy transmission both in and out of hospital environment. PURPOSE: This study was to assess the prevalence of S. aureus nasal carriage, to determine its frequency and nature in hemodialyzed patients of the Rabat Ibn Sina University hospital, in Morocco. PATIENT AND METHOD: The study began in March 2008 according to the following protocol: screening of nasal carriage with five samplings, performed once a month three times, then once a month two times again after an interruption period of three months. Screening was performed weekly during the first month in hemodialyzed patients treated with mupirocin (Bactroban((R)) 2%), and then monthly, to monitor the kinetics of S. aureus eradication. RESULTS: The study included 54 hemodialyzed patients with a mean 44.16+/-14 years of age, sex ratio of 0.54, and mean hemodialysis duration of 118.7+/-67 months. Permanent and intermittent S. aureus carriage was found in respectively 18.52% and 25.92% of patients. Eighty-one strains of S. aureus were identified, 14.81% of which were methicillin resistant. Eradication was sustained beyond 20 months in patients treated with mupirocin. CONCLUSION: This investigation allowed us to identify hemodialyzed patients at risk, so as to implement the rules of individual and collective hygiene, and to extend mupirocin antibiotic prophylaxis in our hemodialysis unit.
