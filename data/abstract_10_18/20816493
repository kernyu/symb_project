Aminoglycosides are highly potent, broad-spectrum antibiotics that kill bacteria by binding to the ribosomal decoding site and reducing the fidelity of protein synthesis. The emergence of bacterial strains resistant to these drugs, as well as their relative toxicity, have inspired extensive searches toward the goal of obtaining novel molecular designs with improved antibacterial activity and reduced toxicity. In recent years, a new therapeutic approach that employs the ability of certain aminoglycosides to induce mammalian ribosomes to readthrough premature stop codon mutations has emerged. This new and challenging task has introduced fresh research avenues in the field of aminoglycosides research. In this chapter, our recent observations and current challenges in the design of aminoglycosides with improved antibacterial activity and the treatment of human genetic diseases are discussed.
