In the livers of susceptible C57BL/6 (B6) mice infected with Leishmania donovani, CD8(+) T cell mechanisms are required for granuloma assembly, macrophage activation, intracellular parasite killing, and self-cure. Since gene expression of perforin and granzymes A and B (GzmA and GzmB), cytolytic proteins linked to CD8(+) cell effector function, was enhanced in infected liver tissue, B6 mice deficient in these granular proteins were used to gauge host defense roles. Neither perforin nor GzmA was required; however, mice deficient in GzmB (GzmB(-/-), GzmB cluster(-/-), and GzmAxB cluster double knockout [DKO] mice) showed both delayed granuloma assembly and initially impaired control of parasite replication. Since these two defects in B6 mice were limited to early-stage infection, innately resistant 129/Sv mice were also tested. In this genetic setting, expression of both innate and subsequent T (Th1) cell-dependent acquired resistance, including the self-cure phenotype, was entirely derailed in GzmAxB cluster DKO mice. These results, in susceptible B6 mice for GzmB and in resistant 129/Sv mice for GzmA and/or the GzmB cluster, point to granzyme-mediated host defense regulation in the liver in experimental visceral leishmaniasis.
