The long term outcomes and sustainability of antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) in the intensive care unit (ICU) require evaluation. This study analysed the effect of a multimodal ICU AMS introduced in a 15-bed medical-surgical tertiary Australian adult ICU in November, 2008, with interrupted time-series analysis of antibiotic usage, resistance and cost from November 2005-October 2015, including national ICU average usage as a control. Overall ICU mortality, 30-day blood stream infection (BSI) mortality and length of stay (LOS) were compared over the same period. There were 2512 patients admitted to ICU before and 6435 after AMS intervention. Post-AMS there was a reduction in the trend of absolute aminoglycoside usage from 63.3 DDD/1000OBDs/month (-1.1; 95%CI -2.2, -0.1; p=0.033) and relative to the national trend (-1.3%; 95%CI -2.4,-0.3; p=0.016). Vancomycin usage increased from 161.2 DDD/1000 OBD/month (1.8; 95%CI 0.03, 3.6; p=0.046) and relative to the national trend (1.8%; 95%CI -0.3,3.9;p=0.092). Sustained post AMS downward trends in carbapenem, antipseudomonal penicillin, 3rd generation cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone use, which did not reach statistical significance. Post-AMS antipseudomonal penicillin resistance declined (-12.8%; 95%CI -24.9,-0.6; p=0.040). Antimicrobial acquisition costs declined by AUD$0.5/OBD/month (95%CI -1.1, 0.1;p=0.096). Over the study period, severity-adjusted ICU mortality declined from 12.9% to 10.4%; RR 0.92(95%CI: 0.82, 1.03) and BSI 30-day mortality from 37.9% to 26.3%; RR, 0.76(95%CI: 0.56, 1.03). Median ICU LOS for ICU survivors increased from 2.3 to 2.6 days. Multimodal AMS sustainably embedded in ICU was associated with reduced broad-spectrum GN antibiotic use, overall antibiotic costs and GN resistance, without adverse clinical impact.
