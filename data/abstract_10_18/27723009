The spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria is an emerging threat to the environment and public wellness. Inappropriate use and indiscriminate release of antibiotics in the environment through un-metabolized form create a scenario for the emergence of virulent pathogens and MDR bugs in the surroundings. Mechanisms underlying the spread of resistance include horizontal and vertical gene transfers causing the transmittance of MDR genes packed in different host, which pass across different food webs. Several controlling agents have been used for combating pathogens; however, the use of lytic bacteriophages proves to be one of the most eco-friendly due to their specificity, killing only target bacteria without damaging the indigenous beneficial flora of the habitat. Phages are part of the natural microflora present in different environmental niches and are remarkably stable in the environment. Diverse range of phage products, such as phage enzymes, phage peptides having antimicrobial properties, and phage cocktails also have been used to eradicate pathogens along with whole phages. Recently, the ability of phages to control pathogens has extended from the different areas of medicine, agriculture, aquaculture, food industry, and into the environment. To avoid the arrival of pre-antibiotic epoch, phage intervention proves to be a potential option to eradicate harmful pathogens generated by the MDR gene flow which are uneasy to cure by conventional treatments.
