Dealing with carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-Kp) strains, which are generally pan-drug resistant, is an uphill task for health care professionals. Owing to limited therapeutic options and the possibility of development of resistance to commonly used biocides in hospital settings, CR-Kp infections pose a serious threat of emergence of a dreaded pandemic. The aim of the study was to highlight the possibility of emergence of biocide resistance among CR-Kp strains. A case study was conducted in a Super-specialty Hospital in September 2015. A 65-year-old female patient post-laparotomy was admitted to the General Intensive Care Unit of a Super-specialty Hospital. CR-Kp was isolated from the blood and mucus trap samples of this patient. Susceptibility testing of three commonly used biocides in our hospital, namely sodium hypochlorite (4% available chlorine), 5% w/v povidone iodine (0.5% w/v of available iodine) and absolute ethanol (99.9%), respectively, was carried out using K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 as control. The test isolate showed reduced susceptibility to sodium hypochlorite in comparison to K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603. The possibility of emergence of biocide resistance among CR-Kp strains poses a threat of disrupting our ongoing efforts for implementation of effective infection control measures.
