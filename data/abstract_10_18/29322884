Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Abortusequi is frequently reported as a cause of abortion in mares and neonatal septicemia and polyarthritis in Asian and African countries, but only sporadically in Europe and the United States. We report an outbreak of S. Abortusequi in foals in Italy, characterized by high mortality. In a herd of Murgese horses, 10 of 34 newborns died at birth and a further 7 died, after developing severe clinical signs, during the first 10 d of life. Tissue specimens from different organs of 2 dead foals, synovial fluids from 4 sick foals, and vaginal and rectal swabs from their dams were cultured. A total of 16 isolates, all as pure cultures, were obtained and identified as Salmonella. The isolates exhibited the same antimicrobial resistance pattern and the same sequence type, ST251, a type that has been associated with S. Abortusequi. Six of 16 isolates were serotyped and found to be S. Abortusequi 4,12:-:e,n,x. Equine practitioners should be aware of S. Abortusequi infection as a cause of neonatal mortality in foals.
