Quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D) and beta-lactams interact positively against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The effect extends to other inhibitors of protein synthesis, but not to inhibitors of polynucleotide synthesis or assembly, or to Q/D plus non-beta-lactam cell wall inhibitors. Moreover, electron microscopy studies have correlated this effect with a thickened cell wall. In this study, we sought to determine whether inhibitors of protein synthesis might produce a specific peptidoglycan muropeptide signature that would correlate with their positive beta-lactam interaction. The muropeptides of six S. aureus isolates (three methicillin-susceptible and three MRSA) were analysed using high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Exposure to 0.25x the minimum inhibitory concentration of inhibitors of protein synthesis consistently produced three main alterations irrespective of methicillin resistance: (i) an increase in peak 12 (a cyclic dimer of glycine-containing disaccharide-tetrapeptide); (ii) an increase in poorly resolved late-eluting materials; and (iii) a decrease in peak 1 (a disaccharide-pentapeptide). Eventually, the rate of autolysis was also decreased, supporting the structural alteration of the peptidoglycan. Other drug classes did not produce these anomalies. An increase in peak 12 was also observed in staphylococci treated with fosfomycin, which decreases expression of the native penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 2 and 4. Parallel blockage of normal PBPs with beta-lactams abolished the anomalies, indicating that they resulted from altered function of native PBPs. This underlines the potential of inhibiting both protein synthesis and transpeptidation simultaneously and suggests that such a drug combination strategy might be efficaciously exploited.
