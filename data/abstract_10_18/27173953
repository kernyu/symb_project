This in vitro study investigates the modulatory effect of three antibiotics (amoxicillin, enrofloxacin, and rifaximin) on contractility of the bovine uterine tissue, in follicular and luteal phases. The evaluation of the effects of these antibiotics (10(-4) M) was performed on oxytocin-induced contractility. The decision to test these antibiotics with the oxytocin (10(-6) M) comes from the reported ability of these combinations of hinder the antibiotic resistance and the formation of bacterial biofilms. The procedures were carried out in isolated organ bath, and the contractile functionality of the strip throughout the experiment was evaluated after a dose of carbachol (10(-5) M). The results demonstrate the different modulatory activity of these antibiotics, on the plateau of contraction induced by oxytocin, in both phases of the estrus cycle. The differing individual antibiotic effects of our testing made it possible to identify, only in some cases. Rifaximin in the follicular phase and enrofloxacin in both phases of the estrous cycle, induced a synergistic enhancement (potentiation) of uterine strip contraction induced by oxytocin. This result is thought important because these associations might enable, in vivo, a simultaneous increase of uterine cleaning and the antimicrobial action on bacteria in planktonic form and of those organized in biofilms.
