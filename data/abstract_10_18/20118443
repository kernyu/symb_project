BACKGROUND: A high level of adherence to prescribed antiretroviral (ARV) regimens is required to achieve and maintain suppression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication and prevent drug resistance. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the possible relationship between psychopathology and ARV medication adherence in Nigeria. METHOD: Persons with HIV infection (N=182) completed various questionnaires on sociodemographic and clinical details, general psychopathology, self-esteem, and medication adherence. RESULTS: Low medication adherence was reported in 26.9% of the participants; significant correlates included presence of psychopathology and perceived poor social support. CONCLUSION: The success of any intervention policy for HIV-infected persons in sub-Saharan Africa must consider both low level of medication adherence and its associated factors.
