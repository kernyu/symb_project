The resistance of 220 coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CNS) (associated with animal disease) to 13 antibiotics were determined using the disk diffusion method. 35.9% of multidrug-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci (MR-CNS) exhibited resistance to five or more than five antibiotics; all of these bacteria were resistant to methicillin too. The new Streptomyces sp. ABRIINW111 was isolated from the Zagros Mountains Hamadan, Iran. The 16S rDNA sequence of the isolate indicated that it has 98% similarity to S. levis, but some mutations in the alpha and gamma regions of the 16S rDNA sequence emphasize the probability of the existence of a new species. Preliminary and secondary antibacterial screenings revealed that the isolate is active against gram negative and positive bacteria. The diethyl ether extracted metabolite of the Streptomyces sp. ABRIINW111 showed an effective antibacterial activity against MR-CNS. So the diethyl ether extract of the new Streptomyces sp. strain ABRIINW111 can inhibit the MR-CNS in vitro, and it can offer a new approach to treat MR-CNS infectious patients.
