Appropriate prescribing practices for fluoroquinolones are essential as evolving resistance patterns are considered, additional treatment indications are identified, and the toxicity profile of fluoroquinolones in children becomes better defined. Earlier recommendations for systemic therapy remain; expanded uses of fluoroquinolones for the treatment of certain infections are outlined in this report. Although fluoroquinolones are reasonably safe in children, clinicians should be aware of the specific adverse reactions. Use of fluoroquinolones in children should continue to be limited to treatment of infections for which no safe and effective alternative exists.
