OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of long-term fluoroquinolone treatment before the biopsy in terms of post procedure sepsis. Three-week fluoroquinolone management before the biopsy may lower serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels and prevent unnecessary biopsies. METHODS: A total of 558 patients were referred to our clinic for transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsy. Of the patients, 205 had received levofloxacin 500 mg once a day for 3 weeks before the biopsy to lower the serum PSA levels (group 1). A total of 353 patients had not received any antibiotics before the procedure (group 2). In terms of the postbiopsy sepsis rate, group 1 and group 2 as well as patients who underwent biopsies in the early period and the latter period of the study were compared. RESULTS: Sepsis was diagnosed in 17 patients (3.0%) after biopsy. Of these patients, 11 (5.4%) and 6 (1.7%) were in group 1 and group 2, respectively (P = .0297, OR: 3.28, 95% CI: 1.10-10.13). Sepsis was diagnosed in 7 patients (1.9%) and 10 patients (5.0%) in the early and the latter period of the study, respectively (P = .0771, OR: 0.38, 95% CI: .13-1.09). Escherichia coli was the causative agent in all patients with a positive culture. In addition, 1 patient also had meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). All of the E. coli isolates were resistant to fluoroquinolones, and 55.6% were positive for extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term fluoroquinolone use to prevent unnecessary prostate biopsy may result in postbiopsy sepsis caused by fluoroquinolone resistant microorganisms.
