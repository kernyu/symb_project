All 16 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates and both Escherichia coli isolates harbored the bla(OXA-232) and bla(CTX-M-15) genes. Furthermore, all 16 K. pneumoniae isolates belonged to a unique pulsed-field gel electrophoresis clone and were assigned to an identical sequence type (ST14). The 2 E. coli isolates were identified as ST131 and ST457. The bla(OXA-232) gene underwent horizontal transfer to E. coli isolates via a conjugative ColE-type plasmid. The introduction of this K. pneumoniae ST14 strain to the Korean hospital was attributed to an index patient who was likely colonized during a prior hospitalization in India.
