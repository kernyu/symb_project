OBJECTIVES: Tigecycline is a treatment option for infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP). Emerging tigecycline resistance in CRKP represents a growing threat. Knowledge of the clinical, microbiological, and molecular characteristics of tigecycline- and carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (TCRKP) is limited. METHODS: Patients infected with TCRKP were identified from a Taiwanese national surveillance study. Clinical data were collected from medical records. We performed susceptibility tests, carbapenemase gene detection, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Furthermore, we performed quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses to assess the expression levels of the efflux pump genes acrB and oqxB. RESULTS: We identified 16 patients infected with TCRKP, with urinary tract infection (UTI) being the most common type of infection (63%). The all-cause 30-day mortality rate was 44% in patients with TCRKP infection. Patients with a site of infection other than the urinary tract had a significantly higher mortality rate than patients with UTIs (83% vs. 20%, p = 0.035). PFGE and MLST revealed no dominant clone or sequence type. Using qRT-PCR, overexpression of both the acrB and oqxB genes was identified in seven isolates, and overexpression of the oqxB gene was observed in another seven. There was poor correlation between acrB or oqxB expression and tigecycline MICs (r = -0.038 and -0.166, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The mortality rate in patients infected with TCRKP in this study was 44% and this is an important subset of patients. The absence of a linear relationship between efflux pump genes expression and MICs indicates that tigecycline resistance may be mediated by other factors. Continuous monitoring of tigecycline resistance among CRKP isolates and resistance mechanisms are necessary.
