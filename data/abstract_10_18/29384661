Inappropriate and frequent use of antibiotics has led to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which cause infectious diseases that are difficult to treat. With the rising threat of antibiotic resistance, the need to develop effective new antimicrobial agents is prominent. We report antimicrobial metallopolymer nanoparticles, which were prepared by surface-initiated reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization of a cobaltocenium-containing methacrylate monomer from silica nanoparticles. These particles are capable of forming a complex with beta-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin, rejuvenating the bactericidal activity of the antibiotic. Disk diffusion assays showed significantly increased antibacterial activities against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The improved efficiencies were attributed to the inhibition of hydrolysis of the beta-lactam antibiotics and enhancement of local antibiotics concentration on a nanoparticle surface. In addition, hemolysis evaluations demonstrated minimal toxicity to red blood cells.
