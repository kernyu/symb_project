OBJECTIVES: AmpC beta-lactamases are classified as Amber Class C and Bush Group 1. AmpC beta-lactamases can hydrolyze broad and extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and are not inhibited by beta-lactamase inhibitors such as clavulanic acid. This study was conducted to identify DHA-23, a novel plasmid-mediated and inducible AmpC beta-lactamase obtained from Enterobacteriaceae. METHODS: A total of 210 carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates were collected from a medical center (comprising two branches) in Northern Taiwan during 2009-2012. AmpC beta-lactamase genes were analyzed through a polymerase chain reaction using plasmid DNA templates and gene sequencing. The genetic relationships of the isolates were typed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis following the digestion of intact genomic DNA by using XbaI. RESULTS: Three enterobacterial isolates (one Escherichia coli and two Klebsiella pneumoniae) were obtained from three hospitalized patients. All three isolates were resistant or intermediately susceptible to all beta-lactams, and exhibited reduced susceptibility to carbapenems. These three isolates expressed a novel AmpC beta-lactamase, designated DHA-23, approved by the curators of the Lahey website. DHA-23 differs from DHA-1 and DHA-6 by one amino acid substitution (Ser245Ala), exhibiting three amino acid changes compared with DHA-7 and DHA-Morganella morganii; three amino acid changes compared with DHA-3; four amino acid changes compared with DHA-5; and eight amino acid changes compared with DHA-2 (>97% identity). This AmpC beta-lactamase is inducible using a system involving ampR. CONCLUSION: This is the first report to address DHA-23, a novel AmpC beta-lactamase. DHA-type beta-lactamases are continuous threat in Taiwan.
