INTRODUCTION: Following more than 20 years of Interferon (IFN)-based treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV), the understanding of viral life cycle led to the development of new antiviral drugs directly targeting HCV replication steps. Daclatasvir (DCV) is a potent inhibitor of non-structural NS5A HCV protein with pangenotypic activity and low-moderate barrier to resistance suitable for IFN-free combination with other direct acting antivirals (DAAs). AREAS COVERED: The present review summarizes DCV key pharmacokinetic features and results from Phase II and III trials, discussing also NS5A resistance. Main literature articles have been identified through Pubmed and Medline search; moreover, abstracts from recent international meetings on liver disease have been scrutinized. EXPERT OPINION: DCV in combination with other DAAs has provided IFN-free regimens with increased efficacy and tolerability. However, suboptimal barrier to resistance and the rapid development of new second-generation NS5A inhibitors will probably make DCV a relatively short-lived drug.
