Brassica rapa is a crucifer that is grown worldwide, mainly as a vegetable. The quality of B. rapa crops is highly affected by the disease caused by the bacteria Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc). Glucosinolates and phenolic compounds can confer resistance to Brassica crops against pests and diseases, but few works have been done to evaluate their role in Xcc resistance. The objectives of this work were: (1) to evaluate the in vivo and in vitro antibacterial effect of gluconapin, its isothiocyanate and the methanolic extracts of B. rapa against the type 4 of Xcc, and (2) to test if there is induced resistance mediated by glucosinolates or phenolic compounds in two varieties of B. rapa. Gluconapin and its ITC varieties had an antibacterial effect on the development of Xanthomonas and this effect was strongly dependent on the concentration applied. Methanolic extracts from B. rapa, containing glucosinolates and phenolic compounds, inhibited the growth of these bacteria. Concentration of gluconapin is higher in resistant plants than in the susceptible ones and there is an induction of gluconapin, some flavonoids and sinapic acid 48 to 72 h after inoculation. Gluconapin plays a role in the constitutive resistance to Xcc, while gluconapin, some flavonoids and hydroxycinnamic acids are induced by a Xcc infection but it is not clear if this induction confers resistance to this disease.
