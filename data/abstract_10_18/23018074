We report the second imported case of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM-1) Enterobacteriaceae encountered in Hong Kong soon after the patient's arrival in the territory for medical care. As NDM-1 is spreading throughout the world via international travel, being an international city, Hong Kong was always expected to encounter the same public health threat. This case also illustrates the importance of active surveillance of at-risk patients in preventing the spread of this 'superbug'.
