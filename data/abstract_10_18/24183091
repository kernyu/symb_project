OBJECTIVE: To define prescription modalities for the use of antibiotics in urology. METHODS: A bibliographic research was performed using the MEDLINE database concerning all the antibiotics usable in urology. Treatments were classified by families; modes of action, indications in urology and adverse events have been detailed. Administrative files for commercial use have been consulted and associated with literature analysis. RESULTS: About 8 classes of antibiotics are usable in urology in a routine use. How they work, indications in urology and adverse events are discussed. CONCLUSION: Knowing that bacterial resistance to quinilones is increasing dramatically, it seems imperative to control the use of 8 classes of antibiotics.
