We report a novel fusion plasmid pP2-3T co-integrating ST3-IncHI2 with IncFII plasmid backbone mediating multidrug resistance and virulence. Phylogenetic analysis and comparative genomic revealed that pP2-3T and other MDR ST3-IncHI2 plasmids clustered together representing a unique IncHI2 lineage that exhibited high conservation in backbones of plasmid, but possessed highly genetic plasticity in variable regions via acquiring numerous ARGs and fusing with other plasmids. Surveillance studies should be taken to monitor multiresistance IncHI2 plasmids among Enterobacteriaceae.
