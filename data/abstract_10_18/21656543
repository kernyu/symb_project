A series of novel 7-(3-aminopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrazol-5(2H,4H,6H)-yl)-6-fluoro-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoli ne-3-carboxylic acid derivatives was designed, synthesized and characterized by (1)H-NMR, MS and HRMS. These fluoroquinolones were evaluated for their in-vitro antibacterial activity against representative Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains. Generally, all of the target compounds display rather weak potency against the tested Gram-negative strains, but most of them exhibit good potency in inhibiting the growth of S. aureus including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis including methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE) (MIC: 0.125-8 microg/mL). In particular, the compound 9g is 2 to 32 fold more potent than gemifloxacin (GM), moxifloxacin (MX), gatifloxacin (GT), and levofloxacin (LV) against S. pneumoniae 08-3, K. pneumoniae 09-23, and P. aeruginosa ATCC27853, 4 to 32 fold more potent than MX, GM, and LV against K. pneumoniae 09-21, and more active than or comparable to the four reference drugs against P. aeruginosa 09-32.
