To determine the need of isolation precautions upon admission, we created and tested an algorithm based on a total of 474 patients with a history of carriage of an antibiotic-resistant organism. Using the algorithm upon patient admission reduced unnecessary isolations by almost 60% while maintaining a high sensitivity to predict persisting antibiotic-resistant organism colonization.
