Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL)-positive community-associated meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) isolates are widespread in many countries, with varying distribution and epidemiology. The aim of this study was to characterise 10 PVL-positive MRSA isolates collected during February 2010 to January 2011 from skin and soft-tissue infections in the North Italian Province of Bolzano. Accessory gene regulator (agr) typing, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing, staphylococcal protein A (spa) gene typing, multilocus sequence typing, toxin gene profiling, polymerase chain reaction for type I arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME) and antimicrobial resistance typing were applied to the isolates. Eight different CA-MRSA clones were identified, including ST30-IVc, ST772-V, ST80-IVc, ST5-IVc, ST88-IVa, ST93-IVa, ST8-IVc and the type I ACME-positive ST8-IVa. The high heterogeneity of PVL-positive MRSA probably reflects the introduction of different clones by international travellers or immigrants.
