16S ribosomal RNA methylase-mediated high-level resistance to 4-,6-aminoglycosides has been reported in clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli from several countries. Three of 1534 (0.2%) isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae and three of 734 (0.4%) Proteus mirabilis isolates from a university hospital in Athens, Greece, were positive for rmtB and highly resistant to all aminoglycosides tested (MICs >/=256 mg/L). Two of the K. pneumoniae rmtB-bearing isolates, were KPC-2 and OXA-10 producers and the third was a DHA-1 producer. One of the P. mirabilis isolates was a VIM-1 and OXA-10 producer and one was an OXA-10 producer. All rmtB-harbouring isolates were clonally unrelated. None of the E. coli (n = 1398) and Enterobacter spp. (n = 414) isolates were positive for armA, rmtA, rmtB, rmtC or rmtD.
