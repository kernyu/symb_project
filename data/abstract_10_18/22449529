Melioidosis, a disease of public health importance in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia, of late has shown an increasing trend in India, particularly Southern India. We describe a case of a 39-year-old diabetic patient with left elbow septic arthritis, multiple liver, splenic abscesses, pneumonia, pleural effusion, followed by sepsis syndrome. Blood cultures and culture of the joint aspirate yielded pure growth of Burkholderia pseudomallei (B. pesudomallei), sensitive to carbapenem, co-trimoxazole and resistant to ceftazidime. The patient was successfully treated with imipenem- cilastin. He was discharged on co-trimoxazole to complete the 24 weeks course and follow-up has continued to date. The patient continues to remain asymptomatic. The case re-emphasizes the need to monitor the trend of B. pseudomallei in India, particularly the development of ceftazidime resistance, which incidentally is the drug of choice.
