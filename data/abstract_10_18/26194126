BACKGROUND/AIMS: Incidence of pyogenic liver abscess (PLA) has been increasing worldwide, especially in the elderly population. Therefore, the aim of this study is to elucidate the clinical features and outcomes of PLA in elderly patients. METHODS: A total of 602 patients diagnosed with PLA from January 2003 to January 2013 were analyzed retrospectively. The patients were divided according to two age groups;>/= 65 years (n=296) and <65 years (n=306). RESULTS: The mean age was 73.59 +/- 5.98 (range, 65-93) years in the elderly group. Significantly higher incidence of females (52.4% vs. 29.1%, p<0.001), hepatobiliary disease (41.2% vs. 24.8%, p<0.001), hepatobiliary procedure (29.4% vs. 13.7%, p<0.001), underlying malignancy (18.2% vs. 4.6%, p<0.001), culture positivity of resistant organism (20.6% vs. 14.4%, p=0.047), occurrence of complication (19.6% vs. 12.8%, p=0.026), and higher white blood cell (13.44 +/- 6.56 vs. 12.26 +/- 5.89, p=0.021), but lower rates of right lobe abscess (67.2% vs. 80.4%, p<0.001), fever (68.6% vs. 79.3%, p=0.003), and lower CRP (16.79 +/- 9.67 vs. 18.80 +/- 9.86, p=0.012) was observed in elderly PLA patients, compared to younger patients. Regarding complications, elderly patients had higher incidence of septic shock (8.1% vs. 2.3%, p=0.001) and cardiovascular disease (2% vs. 0%, p=0.014). CONCLUSIONS: More atypical presentations and complications tend to occur in elderly PLA patients compared with younger patients. Clinicians should be aware of these age-related differences in PLA and devise management strategies accordingly.
