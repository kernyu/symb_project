Sugarcane bagasse, an agricultural waste, was successfully converted into novel magnetic carbon composites by low temperature hydrothermal carbonization at 230 degrees C for 24h, followed by heat treatment at 400 degrees C for only 1h in air. Effects of NaOH and iron loading on the chemical properties of the composites were studied. In addition, various techniques were employed to investigate the physicochemical properties of the composites. Adsorption kinetics and isotherms were investigated with tetracycline (TC) for the magnetic composites. The magnetic carbon composite exhibited 48.35mg/g maximum adsorption capacity and was highly stable chemically and mechanically, with also good magnetic properties. The adsorption of TC by the magnetic adsorbent was mainly attributed to H-bonds and pi-pi interactions. The results indicate that waste sugarcane bagasse from the sugar industries can be efficiently transformed to a magnetic adsorbent for TC removal via a facile environmentally friendly method.
