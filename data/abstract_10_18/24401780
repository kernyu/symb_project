American foulbrood (AFB) is a bacterial disease caused by the spore-forming, grampositive bacterium Paenibacillus larvae, which affects honeybee broods worldwide. The aim of this work was to compare the Epsilometer test (Etest) to the agar dilution method for testing a collection of 22 P. larvae strains to tetracycline by using MYPGP and Iso- Sensitest agars. Results showed that a categorical agreement of 100% was found when using Iso-Sensitest, while a categorical agreement of 86.36% was found (with 3 minor errors) when MYPGP was tested. In conclusion, the Etest could be a rapid and reliable method for testing MIC values of tetracycline in P. larvae only when used in combination with Iso-Sensitest agar. Nevertheless, these results should be confirmed with future studies involving a larger number of isolates.
