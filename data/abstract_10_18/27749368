PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The present review will discuss recent advances in the development of anti-HIV therapies inspired by studies of the mechanisms of host restriction factor-mediated resistance to HIV infection. RECENT FINDINGS: Manipulating the interplay between host cell restriction factors and viral accessory factors that overcome them can potentially be therapeutically useful. Preliminarily successful therapies - some of which are entering clinical trials - either inhibit the ability of virus to evade restriction factor-mediated immunity, or promote intracellular levels of restriction factors. These aims are achieved by multiple means, which are discussed. SUMMARY: Many restriction factors appear to provide potentially useful targets for anti-HIV therapies, so time and interest should be invested in investigating ways to successfully therapeutically manipulate restriction factor-mediated immunity.
