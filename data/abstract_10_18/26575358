The impact of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases (PMAbetas) of animal origin constitutes a public health concern. In this study, 179 Escherichia coli from food animals and products were analyzed, among which, 15 cephalosporin-resistant isolates harboring ESBL (CTX-M-1 [n = 8], CTX-M-14 [n = 1], SHV-12 [n = 2]) or PMAbeta [CMY-2, n = 5]) were identified in poultry and swine, from different farms of distinct regions of Portugal. The multiple sequence-type IncI1-driven spread of ESBLs and PMAbetas, flanked by widely disseminated mobile elements, was guaranteed by ST26/IncI1-harboring blaSHV-12, ST12/IncI1-harboring blaCMY-2, ST3 and ST38/IncI1-harboring blaCTX-M-1, and ST1/IncI1-harboring blaCTX-M-14. An IS10-disrupted In2-4, presenting a new attI2 recombination site, was also detected in a SHV-12/CTX-M-1-harboring isolate. This study highlights the fact that animals may act as persistent sources of ESBL- and PMAbeta-harboring plasmids genes that might be transferred to humans through direct contact or via the food chain.
