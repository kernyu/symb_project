INTRODUCTION: Acne is the most common skin condition in the US. The mainstay of acne therapy includes: topical retinoids, topical antibiotics, benzoyl peroxide (BP), and oral isotretinoin for severe cases. Although these treatment options are highly effective they do have certain drawbacks. Current acne treatment regimens often require patients to use multiple medications, some of which may have irritating side effects. Furthermore, Propionibacterium acnes resistance to antibiotics has become an increasing problem due to the rise in antibiotic use. AREAS COVERED: New therapies that have either been released onto the market or that are being developed include: adapalene-BP combination agent, dapsone 5% gel, minocycline foam, topical nitric oxide-releasing agent, cortexolone 17 alpha-propionate, and CIP isotretinoin. Some of these new therapies address the challenges faced with existing treatment options. For instance, the relatively new combination therapy, adapalene-BP, limits antibiotic resistance and also helps simplify treatment regimens. The newly developed topical nitric oxide-releasing agent also holds potential in limiting antibiotic resistance. EXPERT OPINION: Many of the new therapies discussed in this paper are still in early stages of testing so it is difficult to predict their outlook; however, based on preliminary findings, these therapies seem to be promising.
