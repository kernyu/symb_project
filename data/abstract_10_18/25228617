We describe the pathogens and their antimicrobial profile causing blood stream infections in children over a 4-year period. The commonest pathogens were: non-fermenting Gram negative bacilli other than Pseudomonas, Salmonella species, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella species. High rates of drug-resistance were observed.
