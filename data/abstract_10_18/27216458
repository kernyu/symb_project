Recent studies have shown that the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB) acts not only as a carrier of energy but also as a signaling molecule that has a role in diverse cellular functions. Circulating levels of ketone bodies have been previously reported to be increased in patients with congestive heart failure (HF). In this study, we investigated regulatory mechanism and pathophysiological role of betaOHB in HF. First, we revealed that betaOHB level was elevated in failing hearts, but not in blood, using pressure-overloaded mice. We also measured cellular betaOHB levels in both cardiomyocytes and non-cardiomyocytes stimulated with or without H2O2 and revealed that increased myocardial betaOHB was derived from cardiomyocytes but not non-cardiomyocytes under pathological states. Next, we sought to elucidate the mechanisms of myocardial betaOHB elevation and its implication under pathological states. The gene and protein expression levels of CoA transferase (SCOT), a key enzyme involved in ketone body oxidation, was decreased in failing hearts. In cardiomyocytes, H2O2 stimulation caused betaOHB accumulation concomitantly with SCOT downregulation, implying that the accumulation of myocardial betaOHB occurs because of the decline in its utilization. Finally, we checked the effects of betaOHB on cardiomyocytes under oxidative stress. We found that betaOHB induced FOXO3a, an oxidative stress resistance gene, and its target enzyme, SOD2 and catalase. Consequently, betaOHB attenuated reactive oxygen species production and alleviated apoptosis induced by oxidative stress. It has been reported that hyperadrenergic state in HF boost lipolysis and result in elevation of circulating free fatty acids, which can lead hepatic ketogenesis for energy metabolism alteration. The present findings suggest that the accumulation of betaOHB also occurs as a compensatory response against oxidative stress in failing hearts.
