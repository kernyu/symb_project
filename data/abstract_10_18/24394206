Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has improved the prognosis of HIV-infected individuals dramatically - which is now close to a normal life expectancy in a significant proportion of treated individuals. However, several factors, such as the presence of transmitted HIV drug resistance, adherence to treatment, co-morbidities, drug-drug interactions and adverse effects may influence the efficacy of cART. Due to newer und better tolerated drugs, a trend towards earlier initiation of cART has occurred over time. Since cART should be taken life-long, it is of paramount importance to adequately prepare and inform the patient, in order to optimize adherence and thus treatment efficacy.
