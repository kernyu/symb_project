BACKGROUND: Conyza bonariensis and C. canadensis are troublesome weeds, particularly in fields with minimum tillage, on roadsides and in perennial crops. The distribution of these difficult-to-control species is further increased by the spread of glyphosate-resistant populations. A preliminary investigation has demonstrated the existence of various degrees of glyphosate tolerance/resistance in these populations, underscoring the need to examine the relationship between glyphosate efficacy and plant growth conditions. RESULTS: In populations exposed to glyphosate at different temperatures, glyphosate tolerance increased linearly as the temperature was increased, whereas when grown under the same temperatures, they largely responded similarly to the herbicide. Furthermore, the sensitivity of plants to glyphosate decreased significantly with plant age and increased following temporal exposure to shading. Dose-response studies confirmed the glyphosate resistance of four C. bonariensis populations that were 8-30 times more resistant to glyphosate than the most glyphosate-sensitive population. These populations retained their characteristic glyphosate resistance even under unfavourable growth conditions. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that the effect of glyphosate on both Conyza species is strongly linked to growing conditions. This has great importance for our understanding of glyphosate resistance and for control of these weeds in agricultural systems. (c) 2015 Society of Chemical Industry.
