Most studies have focused on the role of the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) in neurodegenerative diseases, whereas the function of this ubiquitous protein outside the nervous system remains elusive. Therefore, the anti-apoptotic property of PrP(C) in oral squamous cell carcinoma (HSC-2) and colon adenocarcinoma (LS 174T) was evaluated in this study, by stable shRNA knockdown and overexpression, respectively. PrP(C) confers resistance against oxidative stress-apoptosis as indicated by MTT assay, Annexin V-FITC/PI and DCFH-DA staining, but this property is abolished upon N-glycosylation inhibition by tunicamycin. Our results indicate that the inhibition of glycosylation in cancer cells overexpressing PrP(C) could represent a potential therapeutic target.
