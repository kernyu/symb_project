Soluble forms of tellurium are environmental contaminants that are toxic to microorganisms. While tellurite [Te(IV)] is a well-characterized antimicrobial agent, little is known about the interactions of tellurate [Te(VI)] with bacterial cells. In this study, we investigated the role of sulfate transporters in the uptake of tellurate in Escherichia coli K-12. Mutant strains carrying a deletion of the cysW gene in the CysPUWA sulfate transporter system accumulated less cellular tellurium and exhibited higher resistance to tellurate compared with the wild-type strain. Complementation of the mutation restored tellurate sensitivity and uptake. These results indicate that tellurate enters E. coli cells to cause toxic effects via the CysPUWA sulfate transporter.
