This study evaluated inactivation of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in moisture-enhanced restructured nonintact beef cooked to 65 degrees C using different cooking appliances set at different temperatures. Batches (2 kg) of coarse-ground beef (approximately 5% fat) were mixed with an 8-strain composite (100 mL) of rifampicin-resistant E. coli O157:H7 (6.4 +/- 0.1 log CFU/g) and a solution (100 mL) of sodium chloride plus sodium tripolyphosphate to yield concentrations (wt/wt) of 0.5% and 0.25%, respectively, in the final product. Beef portions of 2.54 cm thickness (15 cm dia) were prepared and were vacuum-packaged and frozen (-20 degrees C, 42 h). Partially thawed (-2.5 +/- 1.0 degrees C) portions were pan-broiled (Presto electric skillet and Sanyo grill) or roasted (Oster toaster oven and Magic Chef kitchen oven) to 65 degrees C. The appliances were set at, and preheated before cooking to 149 or 204 degrees C (electric skillet), 149 or 218 degrees C (grill), 149 or 232 degrees C (toaster oven), and 149, 204, or 260 degrees C (kitchen oven). Temperatures of appliances and beef samples were monitored with thermocouples, and meat samples were analyzed for surviving microbial populations. In general, the higher the appliance temperature setting, the shorter the time needed to reach 65 degrees C, and the higher the edge and surface temperatures of the meat samples. Temperatures of 204 to 260 degrees C, regardless of appliance, resulted in greater (P < 0.05) pathogen reductions (3.3 to 5.5 log CFU/g) than those obtained at 149 degrees C (1.5 to 2.4 log CFU/g). The highest (P < 0.05) reduction (5.5 log CFU/g) was obtained in samples cooked in the kitchen oven set at 260 degrees C. The results should be useful to the food service industry for selection of effective nonintact beef cooking protocols, and for use in risk assessments for nonintact meat products. Practical Application: Results of this study should be useful for developing cooking recommendations to enhance the safety of nonintact beef products, and for use in risk assessments of such products.
