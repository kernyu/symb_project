Two multidrug-resistant Bacteroides fragilis clinical isolates contain and express a novel nim gene, nimJ, that is not recognized by the "universal" nim primers and can confer increased resistance to metronidazole when introduced into a susceptible strain on a multicopy plasmid. HMW615, an appendiceal isolate, contains at least two copies of nimJ on its genome, while HMW616, an isolate from a patient with sepsis, contains one genomic copy of nimJ. B. fragilis NimJ is phylogenetically closer to Prevotella baroniae NimI and Clostridium botulinum NimA than to the other known Bacteroides Nim proteins. The predicted protein structure of NimJ, based on fold recognition analysis, is consistent with the crystal structures derived for known Nim proteins, and specific amino acid residues important for substrate binding in the active site are conserved. This study demonstrates that the "universal" nim primers will not detect all nim genes with the ability to confer metronidazole resistance, but nimJ alone cannot account for the very high metronidazole MICs of these resistant clinical isolates.
