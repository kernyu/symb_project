Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) isolated in neonatal late-onset sepsis are often antibiotic resistant. We analyzed CoNS from skin and feces of neonates during hospitalization. Antibiotic resistance of skin isolates increased during hospitalization, especially in Staphylococcus haemolyticus. Staphylococcus warneri showed low antibiotic resistance. Our data suggest that different CoNS species may play distinct roles in colonization.
