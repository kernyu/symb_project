Recent findings have identified Escherichia coli strains that are pan-beta-lactam susceptible (PBL-S) but piperacillin-tazobactam resistant (TZP-R) in vitro We assessed the in vivo significance of this resistance profile in a neutropenic murine pneumonia model using humanized exposures of TZP with 18 clinical E. coli isolates, 8 TZP-S/PBL-S and 10 genotypically confirmed TZP-R/PBL-S. Despite phenotypically and genotypically defined resistance, TZP displayed efficacy against these isolates. Additional studies are required to define the clinical implications of these TZP-R/PBL-S strains.
