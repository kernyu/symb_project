OBJECTIVE: We determined the macrolide resistance phenotypes and genotypes in Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates in Sousse and assessed the serotype distribution. METHODS: We included S. pneumoniae strains isolated at our laboratory (2010-2013). The antimicrobial susceptibility was tested according to CA-SFM specifications. Serotyping was performed by agglutination of latex particles, to identify a subset of serotypes included in pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. The presence of macrolide resistance genes (ermB, mefA, mel) was detected by PCR. RESULTS: A total of 52.8% of 140 S. pneumoniae isolates were macrolide-resistant: MLSB (89.2%) and M (10.8%). The MLSB phenotypes were genotypically confirmed by ermB gene presence. 62% had decreased susceptibility to penicillin. The serotypes were: 14, 1, 23F, and 19A. Serotype coverage by PCV7, PCV10 and PCV13 was 44.2%, 73.6%, and 75.6% respectively. CONCLUSION: 50% of S. pneumoniae isolates were macrolide resistant. The MLSB phenotype encoded by the ermB gene was the most frequent. Serotype coverage seems inadequate.
