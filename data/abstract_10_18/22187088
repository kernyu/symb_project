Pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins play an important role in the disease resistance response. To better understand the function of rice PR proteins, we examined the expressions of ten PR proteins in rice leaves at different developmental stages with or without the interaction between rice and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). The results showed that most of the PR proteins were expressed in rice leaves in normal growth conditions, suggesting that they play a role in rice growth. Six out of ten PR proteins (PR1, PR2, PR3, PR4b, PR8, and PR-pha) showed enhanced expression in Xa21-mediated resistance responses at late stages after inoculation with Xoo. The remaining four PR proteins (PR5, PR6, PR15, and PR16) did not show changes in expression in the resistance response. The expressions of PR proteins in the resistance reaction were further compared with those in the susceptible reaction and a mock treatment. Interestingly, several of the PR proteins were expressed at the highest levels in the susceptible reaction and at the lowest levels in the mock treatment. Among the other four PR proteins, PR5 and PR16 showed changes in the abundance only in the susceptible response, while PR6 and PR15 showed no detectable difference in expression. These data provide fundamental knowledge about the expression of PR proteins in the interaction between rice and Xoo.
