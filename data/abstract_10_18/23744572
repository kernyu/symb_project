BACKGROUND: HIV-1 drug resistance in treatment-naive patients has a significant impact on the individual patient as well as implications for the wider population. These effects are amplified in the context of resource-limited settings, which are rapidly expanding access to antiretroviral therapy. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey at a single treatment site in Kingston, Jamaica was designed to identify the prevalence of HIV-1 drug-resistant mutations in chronically infected, treatment-naive patients. Mutations were identified using the Stanford HIV database algorithm and the World Health Organization (WHO) HIV Drug Resistance (HIVDR) surveillance mutations. RESULTS: The inclusion of 103 cases in the study resulted in 79 (76.6%) amplifiable samples. Genotype analysis revealed that 12.6% (95% CI 5.3, 19.9) were identified as having clinically significant mutations, while 10.1% (95% CI 3.5, 16.7) had WHO HIVDR surveillance mutations. CONCLUSIONS: According to the WHO standard, this study population has a moderate level of HIVDR in treatment-naive patients and strongly implies the need to introduce HIVDR surveillance in Jamaica.
