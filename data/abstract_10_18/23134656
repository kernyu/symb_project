The discovery and development of antibacterial drugs in the twentieth century were major scientific and medical achievements that have had profound benefits for human society. However, in the twenty-first century the widespread global occurrence of bacteria resistant to the antibiotics and synthetic drugs discovered in the previous century threatens to reverse our ability to treat infectious diseases. Although some new drugs are in development they do not adequately cover growing medical needs. Furthermore, these drugs are mostly derivatives of older classes already in use and therefore prone to existing bacterial resistance mechanisms. Thus, new drug classes are urgently needed. Despite investment in antibacterial drug discovery, no new drug class has been discovered in the past 20 years. In this review, based upon my career as a research scientist in the field of antibacterial drug discovery, I consider some of the technical reasons for the recent failure and look to the future developments that may help to reverse the poor current success rate. Diversification of screening libraries to include new natural products will be important as well as ensuring that the promising drug hits arising from structure-based drug design can achieve effective concentrations at their target sites within the bacterial cell.
