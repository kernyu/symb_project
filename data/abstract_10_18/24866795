Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite of clinical importance, especially in immunocompromised patients. Investigations into the immune response to the parasite found that T cells are the primary effector cells regulating gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-mediated host resistance. However, recent studies have revealed a critical role for the innate immune system in mediating host defense independently of the T cell responses to the parasite. This body of knowledge is put into perspective by the unifying theme that immunity to the protozoan parasite requires a strong IFN-gamma host response. In the following review, we discuss the role of IFN-gamma-producing cells and the signals that regulate IFN-gamma production during T. gondii infection.
