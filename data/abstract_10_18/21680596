In Portugal, the need for health educational campaigns to reduce antibiotic misuse, and the implementation of handwashing and hygiene measures to reduce cross-transmission have become national priorities. The implementation of the e-Bug Project in our country has been conducted by the Directorate-General for Health as the beneficiary entity of the Project, in partnership with the Ministry of Education. The involvement of the operational structures of both ministries in the development of the Project has been guaranteed from the beginning. We have translated and produced 6000 junior and senior e-Bug packs, and started to distribute them to science teachers, health education coordinators and school health teams from all over the country, who were identified as stakeholders and registered as e-Bug users in an e-learning platform from the Ministry of Education. Portugal is deeply interested in the long-term sustainability of the e-Bug Project. Portuguese schools and the Portuguese e-Bug team will continue to support this initiative to benefit the health education of Portuguese children.
