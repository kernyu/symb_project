OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and correlates of pretreatment drug resistance (PDR) to first-line antiretroviral drugs among people initiating therapy for HIV in Vietnam. METHODS: Blood was collected during November 2009 to October 2010 from people consecutively initiating ART in four purposively selected public outpatient clinics in three Vietnamese cities. At each study site, recruitment lasted for 6-10 months until the target sample size (range 120-130 individuals) had been reached. The viral load was measured in 501 samples; 490 samples (viral load >/=1000 copies/mL) were genotyped using a nucleotide population-based sequencing assay. Self-reported demographic and clinical data were elicited through interviews. We classified drug-resistance-associated mutations (DRMs) according to the 2009 WHO surveillance list. RESULTS: DRMs were identified in 17/490 participants (3.5%; 95% CI 2.2%-5.5%). The prevalence of DRMs was 1.6% (8/490) against NRTIs, 1.6% (8/490) against NNRTIs and 0.8% (4/490) against PIs; three (0.6%) participants were resistant to both NRTIs and NNRTIs. The overall prevalence of PDR to first-line drugs was low [2.7% (13/490); 95% CI 1.6%-4.4%]. The prevalence of PDR to first-line drugs was greater among 198 HIV-infected participants who injected drugs than among 286 participants who reported risks for sexually acquired HIV (4.0% versus 1.4%, P = 0.079). Multivariable logistic regression analysis suggested that PDR to first-line drugs was significantly higher among people who injected drugs (OR = 3.94; 95% CI 1.13-13.68). CONCLUSIONS: With low PDR, first-line ART may be effective in Vietnam and pretreatment genotyping may be unnecessary. Continuing strategies for the prevention and surveillance of antiretroviral resistance are important for maintaining a low prevalence of antiretroviral resistance in Vietnam. The association between resistance and injection drug use warrants further research.
