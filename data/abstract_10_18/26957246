OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antimicrobial resistance status and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns of Salmonella Enteritidis (S.Enteritidis) strains in Henan province. METHODS: S. Enteritidis strains were isolated from seven sentinel hospitals from March 2011 to December 2013. According to molecular typing and Salmonella (Kirby-Bauer, K-B) drug susceptibility testing method published by the international PulseNet bacterial infectious disease monitoring network and USA Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), we analyzed drug sensitivity of 8 kinds antibiotics and PFGE molecule characteristics of 120 S. Enteritidis isolates from seven sentinel hospitals. RESULTS: Among 120 strains of S. Enteritidis, 77 were isolated from male patients, 43 from female patients. A total of 78 strains S. Enteritidis were isolated from young children ranged from 0 to 5 years old (65.0%), including 57 strains isolated from 6 months to 2 years old (47.5%). The isolated time mainly centralized on May to October of the year, 11 strains isolated in March-April (9.2%), 48 were in May-July (40.0%),54 in August-October (45.0%), 7 in other months, with a typical summer seasonal characteristics. The resistance rate of 120 strains S. Enteritidis to ampicillin was 50.0% (n=60); to ceftazidime was 14.2% (n=17), to cefotaxime was 18.3% (n=22); to cefepime was 5.8% (n=7); to nalidixic acid was 61.7% (n=74); to ciprofloxacin was 8.3% (n=10), to norfloxacin was 5.8% (n=7); to gentamicin was 42.5% (n=51); to streptomycin was 21.7% (n=26); to chloramphenicol was 30.0% (n=36); resistance to methicillin benzyl ammonium was 11.7% (n=14), compound sulfamethoxazole resistance rate was 71.7% (n=86); the tetracycline resistant rate was 47.5% (n=57). All 120 strains of S. Enteritidis had different levels of resistance to 8 kinds of antibiotics, all strains were multidrug resistant strains, 28 isolates were resistant to 3-4 kinds of antibiotics (23.3%), 38 isolates were resistant to 5-6 kinds of antibiotics (31.7%), 39 isolates were resistant to 7-8 kinds of antibiotics (32.5%). All 120 strains of S. Enteritidis were divided into 44 molecular patterns by digestion with XbaI and pulsed field gel electrophoresis. each pattern contained 1-35 strains with similarity ranged from 54.3%-100%. EN14 and EN19 were the main PFGE types, including 35 and 29 strains respectively. CONCLUSION: The status of drug resistance of clinical isolates of Salmonella in Henan province was rather serious, PFGE patterns showed advantages and partial strain's corresponding resistant spectrum have certain relevance and the same aggregation relationship.
