A total of 1,294 Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates obtained in Changsha, China from 2003 to 2015 were examined for their susceptibility to penicillin (PEN), ciprofloxacin (CIP), spectinomycin (SPT), and ceftriaxone (CRO) using the disc diffusion method. In addition, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of CRO for 460 isolates collected during 2008-2015 was determined by agar dilution method. Isolates with intermediate CRO susceptibility were additionally tested for azithromycin susceptibility. Results demonstrated that the rate of resistance to PEN and CIP were 77.5 % and 94.2 %, respectively. Only 4 SPT-resistant and 2 SPT-intermediate isolates were identified. No CRO-resistant isolates were identified, although the percentage with intermediate susceptibility increased from 1.8% in 2012 to 11.9% in 2015. Among these, 3 isolates showed no susceptibility to azithromycin with 2 isolates showing an MIC of 0.5 mug/mL and 1 isolate showing an MIC of 1.0 mug/mL. We recommend azithromycin for treating strains that demonstrate intermediate susceptible to CRO and azithromycin-susceptible N. gonorrhoeae isolates occurring in Changsha.
