The current study was conducted to assess Salmonella spp. contamination in chicken carcasses produced at major poultry processing plants in South Korea. In total, 120 chicken carcasses were collected through 12 individual trials (10 chickens per trial) from six poultry processing plants in the summer of 2014 and the winter of 2015. Eighteen chicken samples (15%) were contaminated with Salmonella, with a higher rate of contamination observed during summer (14 isolates, 11.7%) than during winter (four isolates, 3.3%). Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium was the most prevalent, followed by Salmonella Hadar, Salmonella Rissen, Salmonella Bareilly, and Salmonella Virchow. Among five multidrug resistant isolates, a single strain was resistant to 10 antibiotics, including third-generation cephalosporins. This cephalosporin-resistant strain exhibited the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) phenotype and harbored the gene encoding CTX-M-15, the most prevalent ESBL enzyme worldwide. Herein, repetitive-sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (rep-PCR) subtyping was conducted to discriminate the isolated Salmonella spp. and the ESBL-producing Salmonella isolate was distinguished by rep-PCR molecular subtyping, showing low genetic similarity in their rep-PCR-banding patterns. Given that poultry processing plants are the last stage in the chicken-production chain, the occurrence of Salmonella spp. including ESBL-producing strain in individually packaged chicken products highlights the necessity for regular monitoring for Salmonella in poultry processing plants.
