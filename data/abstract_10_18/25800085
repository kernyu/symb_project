INTRODUCTION: The global prevalence of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) is estimated to be 80 - 115 million and currently viremic infections account for 350,000 deaths annually. As the knowledge about HCV evolves, new anti-viral treatments have been developed. The primary goal of antiviral therapies has been to eradicate HCV virus from serum and achieve sustained virologic response (SVR). Historically, interferon has been a staple of nearly all HCV treatment regimens, despite significant toxic effects. AREAS COVERED: In recent years, HCV treatment has changed rapidly and significantly. All-oral treatment regimens show promise for treatment with shorter duration and more manageable side effects. New antivirals aimed at improving SVR may provide a cure to nearly all HCV-infected patients. The unique combination of ABT-450 (paritaprevir) and ABT-267 (ombitasvir) provides highly effective treatment for patients with genotype 1 HCV. This review will examine the antiviral properties, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and side effects of these agents. EXPERT OPINION: The combination of ABT-450/r and ABT-267 has improved potency, favorable side effect profile, and low risk of resistance compared to the first-generation protease inhibitors. This combination is likely to be a major part of novel upcoming HCV treatment regimens and is likely to be widely used by clinicians. Additional data is awaited in additional patient populations, and with possible shorter treatment durations.
