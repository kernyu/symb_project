BACKGROUND: Active hexose-correlated compound (AHCC) is an extract of a basidiomycete mushroom that enhances the therapeutic effects and reduces the side-effects of chemotherapy. Our previous studies demonstrated that heat-shock protein 27 (HSP27) was involved in gemcitabine-resistance of pancreatic cancer cells and it was down-regulated by AHCC-treatment. However, how AHCC down-regulated HSP27 is unknown. In the present study, we focused on two transcription factors reported to induce HSP27, heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and investigated the effect of AHCC on their expression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: KLM1-R cells were treated with AHCC and the protein expression of HSF1 and HMGB1 were analyzed by western blotting. RESULTS: The protein expression of HSF1 in KLM1-R was down-regulated by AHCC treatment. On the other hand, the protein expression of HMGB1 was not reduced in KLM1-R cells after AHCC treatment. CONCLUSION: The possibility that AHCC down-regulated HSP27 through down-regulation of the HSF1, was herein shown.
