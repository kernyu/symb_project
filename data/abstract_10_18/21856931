We recently demonstrated that CDR1 overexpression in azole-resistant isolates of Candida albicans is due to its enhanced transcriptional activation and increased mRNA stability. In this study, we provide the first evidence of transcriptional regulation of CDR1 by Ncb2, the beta subunit of NC2, a heterodimeric regulator of transcription. Conditional NCB2 null mutants displayed decreased susceptibility toward azole and an enhanced transcription of CDR1. Interestingly, Ncb2 associated with the CDR1 promoter under both repression and activation; however, an increase in recruitment was observed under both transient and constitutive activation states. By chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we showed the preferential recruitment of Ncb2 to the core TATA region under activation (azole-resistant isolate), while under repression (azole-susceptible isolate) it was present at the TATA upstream region. Further, ChIP analysis revealed that Ncb2 binding was not restricted to the CDR1 gene; instead, it was observed on the promoters of genes coregulated with CDR1 by the transcription activator Tac1. The tac1Delta null mutants, which fail to show the drug-induced transient activation of CDR1, also showed no increase in Ncb2 recruitment at the promoter. Taken together, our results show that Ncb2, in conjunction with Tac1, is involved in the transcriptional activation of CDR1, opening up new therapeutic possibilities to combat multidrug resistance (MDR) in C. albicans.
