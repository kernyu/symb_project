The increase in carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria is a matter of concern due to the limited therapeutic options available. In severe infections caused by these isolates, the rapid detection of the mechanisms of resistance is vital. We described a slightly modified version of the Blue-Carba test, rapid Blue-Carba test, which allows the detection of carbapenemases at 4 h of incubation from a haze of bacterial growth obtained from a positive blood culture. It was able to detect carbapenemase-producing isolates (Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii) with a sensitivity and specificity of 98.1 and 100%, respectively. It is a rapid, easy-to-perform and an inexpensive technique that can be applied to routine laboratories, together with the simultaneous identification by mass spectrometry which would help to screen non-enzymatic carbapenem resistance; this method allows the detection of clinically relevant multidrug-resistant bacteria and the early implementation of accurate therapeutic interventions.
