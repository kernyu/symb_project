H5N1 is a subtype of the influenza A virus that can cause disease in humans and many other animal species. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is a potent and selective antiviral drug employed to fight the flu virus in infected individuals by inhibiting neuraminidase (NA), a flu protein responsible for the release and spread of the progeny virions. However, oseltamivir resistance has become a critical problem. In particular, influenza strains with a R292K NA mutation are highly resistant to the oseltamivir. Though the biological functions of the mutations have previously been characterized, the structural basis behind the reduced catalytic activity and reduced protein level is not clear. In this study, molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) approach were employed to investigate the structural and dynamical effects throughout the protein structure and specifically, at the drug-binding pocket. Furthermore, potential of mean force was analyzed using explicit solvent MD simulations with the umbrella sampling method to explore the free energy of binding. It is believed that this study provides valuable guidance for the resistance management of oseltamivir and designing of more potent antiviral inhibitor.
