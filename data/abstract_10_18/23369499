BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy, safety and treatment satisfaction with inhaled colistin versus tobramycin in the cure of chronic Pseudomonas colonization in cystic fibrosis patients. PATIENTS AND METHOD: A quasi-experimental open paired data trial in which patients with cystic fibrosis and chronic colonization by Pseudomonas aeruginosa were included. Patients performed 2 periods of 6 consecutive months of nebulized antibiotics: inhaled tobramycin at a dose of 300 mg/12 h (Pari LC Plus((R))) and colistimethate (I-neb((R))) at a dose of 1 MIU twice a day. Visits were made monthly and at the beginning and the end of each period; we evaluated the body mass index, lung function, number of exacerbations and sputum microbiology. Patient satisfaction was assessed with 2 questionnaires of satisfaction on the treatment and the inhalation devices. RESULTS: A group of 25 patients (8 men and 6 under 14 years) with a mean age of 21.4 (7.2) years and 59.8 (21.1) % of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) were included. During the second period, clinical benefits were obtained in terms of lung function with an FEV1 gain of 5% at 6 months of treatment and reducing the number of exacerbations (1.84 [1.2] vs 0.8 [0.8]; P=.001). The questionnaire score was higher in period 2. CONCLUSIONS: Colistimethate sodium administered through the misting system I-neb((R)) provides clinical benefits in terms of exacerbations and improvement of lung function and patient satisfaction for the nebulized antibiotic treatment.
