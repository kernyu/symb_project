INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary tuberculosis can rarely lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome and anti-tuberculous therapy initiation depends on this difficult diagnosis in ICU. CASE REPORT: A 50-year-old man presented a septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome with bilateral infiltrates mainly in the upper lobes on chest radiography. Diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis was made 10days after admission on examination of cavitary and diffuse infiltrates on a second CT scan, in addition to presence of acid-fast bacilli on smear examination of bronchial aspirates. Amikacin, with four first-line anti-tuberculous drugs, was started in the case of a resistant strain and seriousness of the illness. After 14weeks, he left on rifampicin and isoniazid treatment. CONCLUSIONS: There are no specific recommendations concerning pulmonary tuberculosis in ICU but a delay in initiation of anti-tuberculous therapy is a factor of poor prognosis. Using a second-line anti-tuberculous drug, like amikacin or/and fluoroquinolones, within initial treatment may accelerate improvement of sepsis and immediately treat resistant strains, when genomic methods for detection of resistance are not available in routine.
