Patients infected with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae often experience delays in initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy and increased mortality. A score was developed to differentiate bloodstream infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (16 patients) versus extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (166 patients). A score of >/= 32 demonstrated high area under the curve of 0.80 (95% confidence interval: 0.68-0.92) and a negative predictive value of 97%.
