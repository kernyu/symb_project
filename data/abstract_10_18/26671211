OBJECTIVE: Studies completed internationally have demonstrated an alarming number of patients believed antibiotics are indicated in the treatment of viral infections and other self-limited illnesses. Evaluation of patient practices relating to antibiotics have also demonstrated inappropriate use. Antibiotic misuse by patients and practitioners has been identified as a factor in the development of resistance. Current knowledge, views and practices relating to antibiotic use in Qatar is unknown. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the general population's current antimicrobial knowledge, views and practices in Qatar. METHODS: This study was designed as a self-administered cross-sectional survey. Eligible participants were residents of Qatar who were over the age of 18 and spoke English or Arabic. The questionnaire was developed based on previously published literature and objectives of this study. Data were collected at community pharmacies in Doha, Qatar. KEY FINDINGS: The majority of participants (95.8%) had taken antibiotics in the past. The median knowledge score of the study population was 4/8. Misconceptions relating to use of antibiotics for treatment of viral infections were common. Inappropriate use as evident by hoarding of antibiotics for future use and sharing antibiotics with family or friends was also identified in this study population. CONCLUSION: Community pharmacists in Qatar have an opportunity to improve knowledge of the general population regarding appropriate indications of antibiotics and risk of resistance with inappropriate use.
