Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae causes serious nosocomial infections and therapeutic options are limited. There is increasing evidence suggesting that combination antibiotic therapy is more effective than monotherapy and leads to better outcomes. However, questions remain about which regimen is optimal and how to balance the potential benefits of combination therapy versus the risks and possible complications (e.g., toxicity, increased costs, Clostridium difficile infection). Well-designed randomized clinical trials are needed to clarify these issues.
