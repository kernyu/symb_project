Recent reports have provided evidence for a new concept that in small resistance arteries alpha1D-adrenoceptor-mediated contraction is intimately linked to pannexin-1 (Px1) hemichannels that open to allow the release of ATP, from the smooth muscle effector cell, that acts back on P2Y purinoceptors to cause contraction. This concept mainly relied on using mefloquine 10-20muM as a putative selective Px1 channel-blocking agent to completely inhibit the contraction to phenylephrine, but not K(+) 40mM. Lower concentrations of mefloquine had no effect. The purpose of the present study was to explore the specificity of mefloquine for Px1 channels and the role of these channels in small artery contraction. In mouse and rat isolated small resistance arteries, either pressurised or set up for wire myography, the effects of mefloquine on contractions to K(+), phenylephrine and a range of vasoconstrictor agents were assessed and compared with the Px1 channel inhibitor carbenoxolone. Mefloquine had a wide range of inhibitory actions at 10-20muM, some 200-fold above the concentrations previously shown to inhibit expressed Px1 channel activity. Mefloquine 3-10muM inhibited phenylephrine, U46619, vasopressin, endothelin-1, sympathetic nerve stimulation and K(+) 40mM-mediated contractions in rat and mouse small mesenteric, and mouse thoracodorsal, arteries. Carbenoxolone 1-100muM did not inhibit the contractile responses to these agents in small resistance arteries. The present study demonstrates that in small resistance arteries there is no evidence that Px1 channels releasing ATP have any role in the constrictor actions of alpha1-adrenoceptor activation.
