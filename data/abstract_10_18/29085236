In their review, Arslan et al([1]) did not describe the status of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) treatment with furazolidone and the resistance to this antibiotic. We have presented different surveys showing the resistance of H. pylori to furazolidone from Asia and South America. The resistance rates varied but were mostly low (< 5%). There are not enough data on its efficacy and resistance in the United States and Europe. H. pylori mutations occurring in the oorD gene, including A041G, A122G, C349A(G), A78G, A112G, A335G, C156T and C165T, and in the porD gene, including G353A, A356G, C357T, C347T, C347G and C346A, have been indicated to be possibly related to the observed resistance. Additionally, to complete Arslan et al's statement regarding levofloxacin resistance, it should be noted that compound mutations of N87A, A88N and V65I at codon Asn-87 were recently observed in the gyrA gene for the first time. However, the results on these topics are not sufficient, and more worldwide studies are suggested.
