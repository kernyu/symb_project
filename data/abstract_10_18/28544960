Nosocomial infections associated with biofilm formation on urinary catheters are among the leading causes of complications due to biofilm characteristics and high antimicrobial resistance. An interesting alternative are natural products, such as Dihydromyricetin (DMY), a flavonoid which presents several pharmacological properties, including strong antimicrobial activity against various microorganisms. However, DMY, has low aqueous solubility and consequently low bioavailability. Nanoencapsulation can contribute to the improvement of characteristics of some drugs, by increasing the apparent solubility and sustained release has been reported among other advantages. The aim of this study was to evaluate, for the first time, the feasibility of DMY nanoencapsulation, and to look at its influence on nanoencapsulation of DMY as well as verify its influence on antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity on urinary catheters infected by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The physicochemical characterization showed an average diameter less than 170nm, low polydispersity index, positive zeta potential (between +11 and +14mV), slightly acidic pH. The values of the stability study results showed that the best condition for suspension storage without losing physical and chemical characteristics was under refrigeration (4+/-2 degrees C). The antibiofilm activity of the formulations resulted in the eradication of biofilms both in free DMY formulations and in nanocapsules of DMY during those periods. However, within 96h the results of the inhibition of biofilm by DMY nanocapsules were more effective compared with free DMY. Thus, the nanocapsule formulation containing DMY can potentially be used as an innovative approach to urinary catheter biofilm treatment or prevention.
