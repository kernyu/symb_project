The multidrug efflux system in bacteria can reduce antibiotic concentration inside the cell, leading to failure in the treatment of bacterial diseases. This study evaluated the influence of two efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs), phenylalanine arginyl ss-naphthylamide (PAssN) and 1-(1-naphthylmethyl)-piperazine (NMP), on the gene expression of three multidrug efflux systems, AcrAB, AcrEF and EmrAB in Escherichia coli bovine mastitis isolates resistant to ampicillin and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim simultaneously. Each isolate had at least three multidrug efflux system genes. The acrA and acrB had the lowest expression levels in all treatments, while the emrA or emrB showed the highest expression levels in the presence of ampicillin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, PAbetaN and NMP. EPIs also contributed to the decrease in arcF expression when used in combination with ampicillin treatment. Since PAssN showed stronger effects than NMP, it may serve as an alternative to assist in the antimicrobial therapy of mastitis.
