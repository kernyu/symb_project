INTRODUCTION: Fluoroquinolone use has dramatically increased since the introduction of the first respiratory fluoroquinolone in the late 1990s. Levofloxacin , like other fluoquinolones, is a potent antibiotic, due to high levels of susceptibility among Gram-negative, Gram-positive (including penicillin-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumonia) and atypical pathogens. Levofloxacin is recommended for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and in the management of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB). Levofloxacin demonstrates good safety, bioavailability and tissue penetration, thus maintaining adequate concentrations at the site of infection. High-dose (750 mg), short-course (5 days) therapy regimens may offer improved treatment, especially in HAP, due to higher drug concentrations, increased adherence and the potential to reduce the development of resistance. AREAS COVERED: This article covers medical literature published in any language since 1990 until November 2011, on 'levofloxacin', identified using PubMed and MEDLINE. The search terms used were 'levofloxacin' and 'community acquired pneumonia', 'hospital pneumonia' or 'AECB'. EXPERT OPINION: Levofloxacin is a valuable antimicrobial agent and an optimal treatment option for AECB, CAP (as a monotherapy) and HAP (as combination therapy at a high-dose regimen). Its improved bioavailability and safety profile makes the possibility of shorter hospital stays a reality.
