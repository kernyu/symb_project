Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance (CQR) transporter point mutation (PfCRT 76T) is known to be the key determinant of CQR. Molecular detection of PfCRT 76T in field samples may be used for the surveillance of CQR in malaria-endemic countries. The genotype-resistance index (GRI), which is obtained as the ratio of the prevalence of PfCRT 76T to the incidence of CQR in a clinical trial, was proposed as a simple and practical molecular-based addition to the tools currently available for monitoring CQR in the field. In order to validate the GRI model across populations, time, and resistance patterns, we compiled data from the literature and generated new data from 12 sites across Mali. We found a mean PfCRT 76T mutation prevalence of 84.5% (range 60.9-95.1%) across all sites. CQR rates predicted from the GRI model were extrapolated onto a map of Mali to show the patterns of resistance throughout the participating regions. We present a comprehensive map of CQR in Mali, which strongly supports recent changes in drug policy away from chloroquine.
