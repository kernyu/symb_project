Methods for susceptibility testing of Aspergillus are developed and validated by the European Committee on Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing Subcommittee on Antifungal Susceptibility Testing. Breakpoints for phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing have been determined by breakpoint committees and as part of regulatory processes for the approval of new drugs. Dosages, pharmacokinetics, resistance mechanisms, MIC distributions, pharmacodynamics and epidemiological cut-off values are used in the breakpoint-setting process. Clinical breakpoints are for everyday use in the clinical laboratory to advise on patient therapy. Resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus has been increasingly reported since standards became available.
