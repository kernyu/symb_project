INTRODUCTION: Infection of prostate gland following biopsy is common complication. Most common pathogen is E.coli. Since fluorochinolones are commonly prescribed as prophylaxis, infection caused by E.coli leads to complicated infections, especially due to fluoroquinolone-resistant species. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of fluoroquinolone-resistant E.coli species in rectal swabs of patients undergoing prostate biopsy and to define appropriate antimicrobial agent as prostate biopsy prophylaxis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Rectal swabs were collected in 159 patients undergoing prostate biopsy. The identification of E.coli was performed using the BBL Crystal E/NF identification (ID) System. RESULTS: In the rectal swab of 112/159 patients E.coli was found. In 47/159 cases after incubation, the microbiological evaluation showed no E.coli in these swabs. Defining the specific resistance to microbiological agents, we obtained that E.coli resistant to ciprofloxacin was found in 40 out of 112 patients (50.9%). Resistance to I and II generation of cephalosporin were found in 7%, and 5%, respectively. In 40 out of 112 (35.7%) E.coli resistant to trimetoprim/sulfametoksazol was reported. E.coli resistant to amoxicillin with clavulonian acid and ampicillin was found in 16 out of 112 (14.28%), and in 67 out of 112 patients (59.8%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In all cases with fluoroquinolone-resistant E.coli species positive rectal swabs I generation of cephalosporin seems to be a best choice for prostate biopsy prophylaxis. Moreover, II generation of cephalosporin should be considered for treatment of the eventual subsequent infection. The evaluation of rectal swabs before prostate biopsy is crucial in determining targeted antimicrobial prophylaxis.
