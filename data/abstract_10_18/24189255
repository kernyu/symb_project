Treatment of tuberculosis (TB) is impaired by the long duration and complexity of therapy and the rising incidence of drug resistance. There is an urgent need for new agents with improved efficacy, safety, and compatibility with combination chemotherapies. Oxazolidinones offer a potential new class of TB drugs, and linezolid-the only currently approved oxazolidinone-has proven highly effective against extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB in experimental trials. However, widespread use of linezolid is prohibited by its significant toxicities. AZD5847, a novel oxazolidinone, demonstrates improved in vitro bactericidal activity against both extracellular and intracellular M. tuberculosis compared to that of linezolid. Killing kinetics in broth media and in macrophages indicate that the rate and extent of kill obtained with AZD5847 are superior to those obtained with linezolid. Moreover, the efficacy of AZD5847 was additive when tested along with a variety of conventional TB agents, indicating that AZD5847 may function well in combination therapies. AZD5847 appears to function similarly to linezolid through impairment of the mycobacterial 50S ribosomal subunit. Future studies should be undertaken to further characterize the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of AZD5847 in both in vitro and animal models as well is in human clinical trials.
