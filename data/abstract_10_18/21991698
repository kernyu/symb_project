Urinary tract infection is one of the common clinical condition in the patients presenting to the clinics and hospitals. Detection of common pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern is mandatory for effective treatment. The present study was conducted to detect common pathogens of urinary tract infection (UTI) and their susceptibility pattern to the commonly used antimicrobial agents in local scenario. We conducted a retrospective study on bacteria isolated from the urine samples submitted in microbiology unit from May 2009 to October 2009 at Chitwan Medical College. Study included total 950 clean catched midstream urine samples which were processed to identify the causative agents and their susceptibility pattern to commonly used antimicrobial agents according to the CLSI guidelines. This study showed UTI is more common in young females. Out of total 950 samples, 237 (24.94%) samples grew potential pathogens causing UTI. Escherichia coli were the predominant 163 (68.77%) isolates followed by Enterobacter spp 33 (13.92%). Most of the urinary isolates showed hundred percent resistant to Ampicillin and high degree of resistance to Nalidixic acid, Nitrofurantoin, Cotrimoxazole followed by Ciprofloxacin and Gentamicin. More than 50% of common pathogens were resistant to Ceftriaxone. Uropathogens were more sensitive to Cephotaxim, Amikacin, Ofloxacin and Norfloxacin. Uropathogens resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporin are increasing. Irrational and repeated use of antibiotics is the main cause of increasing resistant organism of UTI.
