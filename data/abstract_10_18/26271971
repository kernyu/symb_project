OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of over-expression of 23 kDa augmenter of liver regeneration (ALR) on cell proliferation and apoptosis in the normal human hepatic cell line LO2. METHODS: The recombinant plasmid expressing 23 kDa ALR (pcDNA6/23 kDa ALR) was constructed and transfected into LO2 cells with MegaTran 1.0 transfection reagent. The expressions of ALR mRNA and protein in LO2 cells were detected by real-time quantitative PCR and Western blotting, respectively; MTS assay was used to detect the cell proliferation of LO2 cells; cell cycle and apoptosis of LO2 cells were measured by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The recombinant expression plasmid pcDNA6/23 kDa ALR was constructed successfully, and the expression of the target protein 23 kDa ALR increased significantly in the transfected cells. Compared with pcDNA6-myc/HisA group, the transient transfection of pcDNA6/23 kDa ALR into LO2 cells promoted cell proliferation and inhibited cell apoptosis induced by H2O2, however, no significant differences were detected in G0 phase and S phase. CONCLUSION: The over-expression of 23 kDa ALR in LO2 cells promoted the cell proliferation and enhanced cell resistance to H2O2.
