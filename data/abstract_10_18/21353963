Two novel lipoglycopeptides, dalbavancin and telavancin, and relevant comparative agents were tested for in vitro activity against clinical isolates of staphylococci and streptococci collected in the cross-Canada surveillance study, CANWARD, in 2007-2009. The rank order of potency (based on MIC(90) [mug/mL], i.e., the concentration of antimicrobial agent required to inhibit the growth of 90% of isolates tested) of glycopeptides against both Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was dalbavancin (0.06 mug/mL) >telavancin (0.5 mug/mL) > vancomycin (1-2 mug/mL); concurrent susceptibility or resistance to oxacillin in staphylococci did not affect potency of glycopeptides. Dalbavancin and telavancin also demonstrated potent activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant isolates (MIC(90), </= 0.03 mug/mL; </= 0.06 mug/mL), and Streptococcus pyogenes (</= 0.03 mug/mL; 0.06 mug/mL). Based on their robust in vitro activities, dalbavancin and telavancin have the potential to treat Gram-positive infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae.
