Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) threatens the effective prevention and treatment of bacterial diseases in both humans and animals. Globally, there has been much research done regarding resistant bacteria in the livestock industry, but few published resources collate this information. This report discusses a risk assessment (RA) framework and subsequent analysis of data availability for AMR in bacteria from 4 livestock sectors: dairy cattle, beef cattle, pigs and poultry, with particular reference to ESBL-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL E. coli) prevalence in the dairy cattle sector within the United Kingdom. The aim of this assessment was to identify where quality data exist, for the purpose of parameterising a quantitative RA, and where it would be useful to direct future research to provide quality data to improve the current knowledge base. Such research is necessary to support risk modelling and forecasting capability regarding the relative contributions of factors that maintain the emergence and spread of AMR in bacteria. The review suggested that there are data gaps regarding ESBL E. coli occurrence in the following: beef cattle, bulk tank milk and dairy products, animal-by-products, the farm environment (including after flooding) as well as the effect of animal stress on shedding levels. Filling these data gaps prior to undertaking a full quantitative RA would make the assessment more robust and give greater confidence in the final outcome and consequently inform the targeting and prioritising of interventions to minimise spread of AMR in bacteria in farm animals.
