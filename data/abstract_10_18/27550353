Drinking water has rarely been recognized as a source of antimicrobial resistance for humans, and only in low-income countries. Here, a sequence type 48 Escherichia coli isolate carrying the blaCTX-M-1 IncI1/ST3 plasmid was recovered from drinking water in France. This plasmid was similar to other blaCTX-M-1 IncI1/ST3 plasmids found previously in animals and humans. Our findings highlight the possible human transfer of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) genes through drinking water in high-income countries.
