MRSA is becoming increasingly common worldwide. With the emergence of new highly spreadable strains (community associated or CA-MRSA) novel presentation skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) are being seen. Recurrent SSTI, including folliculitis, furunculosis and abscesses account for an increasing proportion of SSTI seen in the emergency department. Empirical antimicrobial management choices can be difficult, but clues to the nature of the MRSA may be gleaned from the history and clinical presentation. More severe SSTI due to necrotising fasciitis and purpura fulminans are emerging and warrant the broadest possible empirical Gram-positive cover, ideally with antimicrobials that stop exotoxin production, and sometimes intravenous immunoglobulin to neutralise exotoxins already produced.
