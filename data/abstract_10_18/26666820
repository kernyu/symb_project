Acquisition of gemcitabine resistance in breast cancer has not been fully clarified. Prior studies suggest that miRNAs are important to chemoresistance in solid tumors and we confirmed that miR-21 is involved in the development of gemcitabine resistance. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and AKT pathway activation were noted to be important to this resistance as well. PTEN, a direct target gene of miR-21, was significantly downregulated in gemcitabine-resistant breast cancer cells and restoration of PTEN expression blocked miR-21-induced EMT and gemcitabine resistance. Our data offer novel insight into gemcitabine resistance in breast cancer and suggest that miR-21 may be used to predict optimal breast cancer therapy and may be a potential therapeutic target for reversing gemcitabine resistance.
