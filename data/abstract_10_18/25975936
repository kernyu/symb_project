Piperaquine-dihydroartemisinin combination is the latest addition to the repertoire of ACTs recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for treatment of falciparum malaria. Due to the increasing resistance to artemisinin derivatives, CSIR-CDRI has developed a prospective short acting, trioxane antimalarial derivative, CDRI 97-78. In the present study, a liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous quantification of piperaquine (PPQ) and 97-63, the active metabolite of CDRI 97-78 found in vivo, was developed and validated in 100 muL rat plasma using halofantrine as internal standard. PPQ and 97-63 were separated using acetonitrile:methanol (50:50, v/v) and ammonium formate buffer (10 mM, pH 4.5) in the ratio of 95:5(v/v) as mobile phase under isocratic conditions at a flow rate of 0.65 mL/min on Waters Atlantis C18 (4.6 x 50 mm, 5.0 microm) column. The extraction recoveries of PPQ and 97-63 ranged from 90.58 to 105.48%, while for the internal standard, it was 94.27%. The method was accurate and precise in the linearity range 3.9-250 ng/mL for both the analytes, with a correlation coefficient (r) of >/= 0.998. The intra- and inter-day assay precision ranged from 2.91 to 8.45% and; intra- and inter-day assay accuracy was between 92.50 and 110.20% for both the analytes. The method was successfully applied to study the effect of oral co-administration of PPQ on the pharmacokinetics of CDRI 97-78 in Sprague-dawley rats and vice versa. The co-administration of CDRI 97-78 caused significant decrease in AUC0-infinity of PPQ from 31.52 +/- 2.68 to 14.84 +/- 4.33 h*microg/mL. However, co-administration of PPQ did not have any significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of CDRI 97-78.
