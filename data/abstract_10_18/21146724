The in vitro activity of 5 novel Microbiotix bis-indole agents (MBXs) (Microbiotix, Worcester, MA) against 30 multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii (including 18 resistant to carbapenems) was evaluated. Overall, MIC(90)'s ranged from 1 to 8 mug/mL, whereas those for imipenem were >64 mug/mL. MBX 1196 was the most potent (MIC(90), 1 mug/mL). MBXs are compounds that are highly effective against MDR A. baumannii.
