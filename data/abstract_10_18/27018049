BACKGROUND: Chronic infection with Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) has a detrimental effect on morbidity and mortality for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). It is therefore logical to attempt to eradicate new isolates however there is a paucity of information to guide treatment. We report the successful eradication of new isolates of BCC in two children with CF. CASE PRESENTATION: Burkholderia cepacia was successfully eradicated in a 14 year old boy with CF and Burkholderia gladioli was successfully eradicated in a six year old girl with CF. In both children two weeks of intravenous (IV) tobramycin, ceftazidime and temocillin were used followed by three months of inhaled tobramycin. Bronchoalveolar lavage samples taken during flexible bronchoscopy were used prior to treatment to exclude spontaneous clearance as well as after treatment to confirm eradication. CONCLUSIONS: New isolates of BCC can be successfully eradicated in children with CF. More research is urgently required in this area to identify the best treatment regimen for BCC eradication.
