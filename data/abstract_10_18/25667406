All clinical isolates of group B Streptococcus (GBS; Streptococcus agalactiae) are considered uniformly susceptible to beta-lactams, including penicillins. However, GBS with reduced penicillin susceptibility (PRGBS) were first identified by our group in Japan and have also been reported from North America. PRGBS are non-susceptible to penicillin because of acquisition of amino acid substitutions near the conserved active-site motifs in PBP2X. In particular, V405A and Q557E are considered the key amino acid substitutions responsible for penicillin non-susceptibility. We revealed that in addition to the substitutions in PBP2X, an amino acid substitution in PBP1A confers high-level cephalosporin resistance in GBS. As the number of publications on GBS with reduced beta-lactam susceptibility (GBS-RBS), especially PRGBS, and concomitantly the need for a systematic classification of GBS-RBS is increasing, we propose here a classification of GBS-RBS based on the amino acid substitutions in their PBPs.
