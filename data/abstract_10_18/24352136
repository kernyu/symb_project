Patients with HIV are at an increased risk for cardiovascular disease, both as a result of treatment with protease inhibitors and from the disease itself. The medication regimens of patients with HIV and cardiovascular comorbidities are complex and require careful assessment for potentially serious drug-drug interactions. We report a case of clopidogrel non-responsiveness in a patient with HIV, latent tuberculosis and cardiovascular disease with a history of myocardial infarction. To our knowledge, this is the first report of significant drug interactions between clopidogrel, isoniazid and ritonavir. This case underscores the importance of a detailed drug interaction screening in infectious disease patients taking complex medication regimens, including clopidogrel.
