The Australian Gonococcal Surveillance Programme monitors antibiotic susceptibility testing of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates in all states and territories. In 2011, the in vitro susceptibility of 4,133 isolates of gonococci from public and private sector sources was determined by standardised methods. Varying antibiotic susceptibility patterns were again reported across jurisdictions and regions. Resistance to the penicillins nationally was 25%, and with the exception of the Northern Territory and Tasmania, ranged from 17% in South Australia and Western Australia, to 44% in Victoria. Quinolone resistance, most at high minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) levels, was 27% nationally (except in the Northern Territory and Tasmania), ranging from 12% in the Australian Capital Territory to 40% in Victoria. Decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone (MIC 0.06 mg/L or more), was found nationally in 3.2% of isolates, a decrease from 4.8% in 2010. There has not been an isolate of N. gonorrhoeae with a ceftriaxone MIC value greater than 0.125 mg/L reported in Australia. Nationally, all isolates remained sensitive to spectinomycin. Azithromycin surveillance was performed in the Australian Capital Territory; New South Wales; Queensland; Western Australia; the Northern Territory and South Australia. Resistance was found in low numbers of gonococci, with MIC values up to 16 mg/L. The source and site of the isolates referred to the program varied by geographic location. In larger urban centres the ratio of male to female cases was high, and rectal and pharyngeal isolates were common in men. In other centres, and in rural Australia, the male to female ratio was lower, and most isolates were from the genital tract.
