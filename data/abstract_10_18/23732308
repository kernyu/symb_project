Invasive fungal infections have increased significantly in the past few decades because of the increase in high-risk populations. To investigate the distribution and drug susceptibilities of such infections, we analyzed all 152 Candida isolates causing candidemia from 2004 to 2006 at the China Medical University Hospital, a medical center in central Taiwan. Candida albicans was the most common species, accounting for 52.6% of the isolates, followed by C. tropicalis (19.7%), C. parapsilosis (14.5%), C. glabrata (8.6%), C. guilliermondii (3.9%), and C. pelliculosa (0.7%). All isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B, anidulafungin, micafungin, and voriconazole according to minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) after a 24-h incubation; 0.7%, 6.6%, and 7.9% of isolates were resistant to amphotericin B, fluconazole, and voriconazole, respectively, after 48-h incubation. Both C. albicans and C. parapsilosis had high degrees of agreement for azoles between 24- and 48-h incubation periods, whereas C. glabrata (38.5-46.2%) and C. tropicalis (56.7-63.3%) did not. The majority of the isolates with high azole MICs displayed a trailing growth phenotype. Hence, the MICs of different drugs after 24-h incubation may be considered for prognosis of candidemia.
