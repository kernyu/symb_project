Candida parapsilosis is the second most prevalent fungal agent causing bloodstream infections. Nevertheless, there is little information about the molecular mechanisms underlying azole resistance in this species. Mutations (G1747A, A2619C, and A3191C) in the MRR1 transcription factor gene were identified in fluconazole- and voriconazole-resistant strains. Independent expression of MRR1 genes harboring these mutations showed that G1747A (G583R) and A2619C (K873N) are gain-of-function mutations responsible for azole resistance, the first described in C. parapsilosis.
