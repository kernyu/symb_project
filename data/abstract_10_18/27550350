Persister cells are highly tolerant to different antibiotics and are associated with relapsing infections. In order to understand this phenomenon further, we exposed a transposon library to a lethal concentration of ampicillin, and mutants that survived were identified by transposon sequencing (Tn-Seq). We determined that mutations related to carbon metabolism, cell envelope (cell wall generation and membrane proteins), and stress response have a role in persister cell generation.
