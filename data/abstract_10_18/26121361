The efficacy of entecavir (ETV) and tenofovir (TDF) for the treatment of nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA)-experienced chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients has been little studied. Here, we compare the efficacy of both ETV and TDF in NA-experienced CHB patients without detectable genotypic resistance. This retrospective cohort study included consecutive NA-experienced patients who had neither current nor previous genotypic resistance and had received ETV or TDF for at least 6 months. Overall, 202 patients (146 patients in the ETV group and 56 in the TDF group) were analyzed. The cumulative probabilities of complete virologic suppression (CVS) at month 12 were 76.1% in the ETV group and 95.0% in the TDF group (P<0.001), respectively. The TDF-treated group achieved CVS more rapidly than the ETV group for both Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative and -positive patients (P = 0.006 and < 0.001, respectively), and for those with both low (< 2,000 IU/mL) and high (>/= 2,000 IU/mL) HBV DNA levels (P = 0.01 and 0.002, respectively). TDF group had an increased probability of achieving CVS (hazard ratio, 2.242; 95% confidence interval, 1.587-3.165; P = 0.001), after adjustment for HBV DNA level, the presence of HBeAg, and a history of CVS during prior treatment. During the treatment period, 23 patients (15.8%) in the ETV group developed virologic breakthrough, compared to none in the TDF group. The cumulative probabilities of developing virologic breakthrough and ETV-resistance at month 24 were 9.7% and 5.3%, respectively. In conclusion, TDF is preferable to ETV for achieving CVS in NA-experienced CHB patients without genotypic resistance.
