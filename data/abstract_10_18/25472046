Microbes commonly infect the female reproductive tract of cattle, causing infertility, abortion and post partum uterine diseases. When organisms reach the uterus, the resistance to disease depends on the balance between the classic triad of the virulence of the microbes, the host defence systems and the environment. The present review considers each aspect of this triad, using postpartum uterine disease as an exemplar for understanding disease resistance. The bacteria that cause postpartum uterine disease are adapted to the endometrium, and their microbial toxins cause tissue damage and inflammation. However, non-specific defence systems counter ascending infections of the female reproductive tract, and inflammatory responses in the endometrium are driven by innate immunity. Disease resistance to bacterial infection involves many genes involved in the maintenance or restoration of tissue homeostasis in the endometrium, including antimicrobial peptides, complement, cytokines, chemokines and Toll-like receptors. The most important environmental factors facilitating the development of postpartum uterine disease are related to trauma of the reproductive tract and to the metabolic stress of lactation in dairy cows. Long-term solutions for uterine disease will include genetic selection for disease resistance and optimising the care of the animal before, during and after parturition.
