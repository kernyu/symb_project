Mupirocin is a topical antibiotic largely used to eradicate staphylococcal nasal carriage. Here, we investigated the prevalence of mupirocin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates recovered from patients in different wards in a hospital (Lyon, France), which were determined both phenotypically with an Epsilometer test (Etest) and genetically by PCR for mupA and mupB.
