Nine bis(tryptophan) derivatives (BTs) and two control compounds were synthesized and tested for antimicrobial activity against two Escherichia coli strains and a Staphylococcus aureus strain. The effects of linker type, shape, and conformational rigidity were manifested in dramatic differences in altering tetracycline potency when coadministered with that antibiotic. A reversal of resistance was observed for an E. coli strain having a TetA efflux pump. Survival of mammalian cells was assayed with good result.
