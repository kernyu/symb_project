This review describes the current state-of-art of carbapenemase detection methods. Identification of carbapenemases is first based on conventional phenotypic tests including antimicrobial susceptibility testing, modified-Hodge test and carbapenemase-inhibitor culture tests. Second, molecular characterization of carbapenemase genes by PCR sequencing is essential. Third, innovative biochemical and spectrometric detection may be applied.
