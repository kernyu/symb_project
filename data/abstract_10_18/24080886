OBJECTIVES: To analyze a cohort of patients with Enterococcus sp. bacteraemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective and observational study of a cohort of non-pediatric in-patients with Enterococcus spp. bacteraemia (June 2007-September 2009). Data collection from clinical records was done according to a standard protocol. We analyzed epidemiological, clinical and microbiological data. Treatment with glycopeptides in non allergic patients or in case of betalactam susceptibility (ampicillin) was considered "optimizable". RESULTS: Three were 106 cases of bacteraemia (2.2/1000 admitted patients; 84% E. faecalis); 83% had an underlying condition; 88% nosocomial or health related cases. Urinary infection was present in 20% and primary bacteraemia in 47%. High level resistance to gentamicin (HLRG) was present in 60%; there was no vancomycin or linezolid resistance. Most frequent empiric treatments were penicillin-betalactamase inhibitor (25%) and glycopeptides (22%). Most frequent definitive treatment was glycopeptides (34%), being "optimized" 21% and 44% of empiric and definitive treatments, respectively. Mortality was 23% (related, 14%). In the multivariate analysis, risk factors associated with HLRG were nosocomial acquired infection (OR 6.083; 95CI% 1.428-25.915) and no-abdominal origin (OR 6.006; 95CI%1.398-25.805). In multivariate analysis, independent risk factors for mortality were: Pitt > 3 (OR 14.405; 95CI%2.236-92.808) and active empiric treatment (OR 8.849; 95CI% 1.101-71.429). Incidence in previous cohort was similar but HLRG rate has increased. CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors associated with HLRG were nosocomial acquired infection and no-abdominal origin. Risk factors for mortality were initial clinical severity and having received active empiric treatment. HLRG rate has increased.
