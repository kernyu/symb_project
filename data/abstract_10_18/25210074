We evaluated the performance of the automated Vitek 2 system against disk diffusion for susceptibility testing of Staphylococcus aureus strains showing various resistance mechanisms to macrolides and lincosamides (ML). The Vitek 2 system showed 100% concordance with the D-zone test in detection of the most common resistance mechanisms to ML, including methylase and efflux systems.
