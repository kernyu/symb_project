The diagnosis "HIV infection" has severe consequences. False positive or false negative HIV results must be avoided. The Swiss Federal Office of Public Health generated a concept for HIV testing which also includes the characterization of HIV for optimal medical care of the HIV-infected patient. This concept requests that the following four questions are answered: 1. Is the patient indeed HIV-infected? 2. Is it HIV-1 or HIV-2, and if the patient is tested positive for HIV-1, what group, M or O? Are drug resistances present? 3. What is the HIV copy number in the blood? 4. What is the percentage of recent HIV-infections (< 12 months) among all tested positive test results? We also present a short summary how to approach the HIV-infected patient at the initial and subsequent visits.
