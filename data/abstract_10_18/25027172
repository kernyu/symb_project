Here, we report a case of non-toxigenic Corynebacterium diphtheriae in a previously healthy 14-year-old girl that was acquired in Ethiopia and presented locally. This is the first clinical case of penicillin-resistant C. diphtheriae in the UK. This is significant finding because penicillin is the recommended first-line agent for the prophylaxis against and treatment of C. diphtheriae in patients who are not allergic to penicillin.
