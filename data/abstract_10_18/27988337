Gemcitabine sensitization is important for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. We have previously shown that DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) over-expression causes Akt activation and gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer cells. Here, we aim to downregulate DNA-PKcs via introduction of micorRNA-101 ("miR-101"). We showed that forced-expression of miR-101 downregulated DNA-PKcs and potentiated gemcitabine-induced PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cell death and apoptosis. Contrarily, miR-101 depletion through expressing antagomiR-101 in PANC-1 cells resulted in DNA-PKcs upregulation and gemcitabine resistance. DNA-PKcs downregulation is the primary reason of gemcitabine-sensitization by miR-101. DNA-PKcs inhibition (by NU7026) or silence (by targeted siRNAs) disabled miR-101-mediaetd gemcitabine sensitization. Significantly, Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation in PANC-1 cells was also inhibited by miR-101, but was augmented with antagomiR-101 expression. Importantly, we showed that miR-101 level was downregulated in gemcitabine-resistant human pancreatic cancer tissues, which was correlated with DNA-PKcs upregulation. Together, these results suggest that miR-101 sensitizes PANC-1 cells to gemcitabine possibly via downregulating DNA-PKcs.
