A combination of chloroquine (CQ) and primaquine (PQ) had been used as the first-line treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Rangamati, Bangladesh until the end of 2004. Doctors or medical staffs had felt that CQ plus PQ had become less effective against uncomplicated falciparum malaria patients, but that it was more effective against the minority-indigenous patients than the Bengali patients. The efficacy of CQ plus PQ and the mutation status of the CQ resistance transporter (pfcrt) gene of infecting P. falciparum were, thus, investigated for 45 uncomplicated falciparum malaria patients in Rangamati in 2004. The total failure rate was 57.8%. One or two pfcrt sequences (CIETH and SMNTH at positions 72, 74-76, and 97, mutation underlined) with K76T mutation known to be related to CQ-resistant phenotype were detected in 38 patients' blood samples. Of the 38 patients, in total 15 patients (14/25 minority-indigenous and 1/13 Bengali patients) resulted in adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). There was a statistically significant difference in ACPR rate between the minority-indigenous patients and the Bengali patients. P. falciparum with mutant or resistant pfcrt (pfcrt-resistant) was detected by PCR in blood samples on day 28 for 10 ACPR minority-indigenous patients but not for the only one Bengali ACPR patient, who all were infected with pfcrt-resistant P. falciparum on day 0. The minority-indigenous patients, but not Bengalis, are suggested to be often cured by CQ plus PQ, leaving a very few parasites detectable only by PCR, even when they are infected with pfcrt-resistant P. falciparum.
