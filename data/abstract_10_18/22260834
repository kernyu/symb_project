BACKGROUND/AIMS: To explore the risk factors of gene-resistant mutations during nucleotide treatment. METHODOLOGY: A total of 320 patients with CHB were randomly divided into lamivudine (LAM, 107 cases), adefovir (ADV, 106 cases) and entecavir (ETV, 107 cases) groups, and P gene mutations of HBV were regularly detected. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis were performed. RESULTS: There was no statistical significance in baseline data between the three groups. The gene-resistant mutation rates were 20.0%, 0.0% and 0.0% one year later, 37.1%, 3.8% and 0.0% two years later, 42.8%, 9.5% and 0.9% three years later, and 64.7%, 25.7% and 0.9% four years later in LAM, ADV and ETV groups, respectively. In LAM group, rtL180M combined with rtM204V mutations accounted for 32.7% and in ADV group, rtN236T mutation accounted for 12.3%. The gene-resistant mutation rate was the most strong in LAM group. CONCLUSIONS: With an extension of time, gene-resistant mutation rates are increased, but it is the highest in LAM group and the lowest in ETV group. Family history, the negative conversion time of HBV DNA and different nucleosides are independent risk factors of gene-resistant mutations.
