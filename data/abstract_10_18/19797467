Kytococcus schroeteri, a Gram-positive coccus, is usually regarded as part of the human skin flora. It has been described in prosthetic valve endocarditis but never as being involved in osteoarticular infections. We report here the first case of a spondylodiscitis due to K. schroeteri identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
