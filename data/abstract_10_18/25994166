A multitarget PCR was developed for the direct detection of penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae (PPNG). The assay was validated by testing 342 PPNG isolates and 415 clinical samples. The method is suitable for routine detection of PPNG strains. Its multitarget approach reduces the potential for false-negative results caused by sequence variations.
