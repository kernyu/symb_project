The clonal distribution of Escherichia coli across an unselected population in the current era of widespread antimicrobial resistance is incompletely defined. In this study, we used a newly described clonal typing strategy based on sequencing of fumC and fimH (i.e., CH typing) to infer multilocus sequence types (STs) for 299 consecutive, nonduplicate extraintestinal E. coli isolates from all cultures submitted to Olmsted County, MN, laboratories in February and March 2011 and then compared STs with epidemiological data. Forty-seven different STs were identified, most commonly ST131 (27%), ST95 (11%), ST73 (8%), ST127 (6%), and ST69 (5%). Isolates from these five STs comprised two-thirds of health care-associated (HA) isolates but only half of community-associated (CA) isolates. ST131 was represented overwhelmingly (88%) by a single recently expanded H30 subclone, which was the most extensively antimicrobial-resistant subclone overall and was especially predominant in HA infections and among adults >50 years old. In contrast, among patients 11 to 50 years old, ST69, -95, and -73 were more common. Because of the preponderance of the H30 subclone of ST131, ST diversity was lower among HA than CA isolates, and among antimicrobial-resistant than antimicrobial-susceptible isolates, which otherwise had similar ST distributions. In conclusion, in this U.S. Midwest region, the distribution and diversity of STs among extraintestinal E. coli clinical isolates vary by patient age, type of infection, and resistance phenotype. ST131 predominates among young children and the elderly, HA infections, and antimicrobial-resistant isolates, whereas other well-known pathogenic lineages are more common among adolescents and young adults, CA infections, and antimicrobial-susceptible isolates.
