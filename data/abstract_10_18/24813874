OBJECTIVES: Limited clinical experience exists regarding the management of prosthetic joint infection (PJI) due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative organisms. We review three cases of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) complicating PJI. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of all patients at a tertiary care institution with CRKP complicating PJI between January 2007 and December 2010. Demographic data, procedures, organisms involved, length of stay, antibiotic treatments, and outcomes were collected. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on CRKP isolates, and the mechanism of resistance was ascertained by PCR. RESULTS: This analysis demonstrated that: (1) the CRKP possessed blaKPC and were difficult to eradicate (persistent) in PJI; (2) multiple surgeries and antibiotic courses were undertaken and patients required a prolonged length of stay; (3) resistance to colistin and amikacin emerged on therapy; (4) the same strain of CRKP may be responsible for relapse of infection; (5) significant morbidity and mortality resulted. CONCLUSIONS: These cases highlight the opportunistic and chronic nature of CRKP in PJIs and the need for aggressive medical and surgical treatment. Further investigations of the management of CRKP PJI and new drug therapies for infections due to MDR Gram-negative organisms are urgently needed.
