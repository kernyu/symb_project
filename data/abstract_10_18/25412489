OBJECTIVES: To monitor the prevalence of Campylobacter spp. in poultry in slaughterhouses, poultry and pork liver at retail, and cows milk in Moravia. To determine the resistance of animal isolates to selected antibiotics; and to compare it with an antibiogram of human strains. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Throughout the year 2013, the following samples were collected in the South Moravian and Olomouc Regions: mixed samples of broiler cecal contents in slaughterhouses, fresh and frozen chickens and pork liver at retail, and raw cows milk from vending machines. The samples were both qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed for the presence of Campylobacter spp. The isolates recovered were tested for resistance to antibiotics. For comparison, antimicrobial resistance was also studied in human isolates from the same regions. RESULTS: A total of 41.8% of the tested food samples were found to contain Campylobacter spp.. The most contaminated (73.2%) were fresh chickens. Campylobacter spp. were not detected in raw cows milk samples. The isolates showed high levels of resistance to quinolone antibiotics and, in the case of C. coli, also to tetracycline and streptomycin. CONCLUSION: The studied commodities were frequently contaminated with Campylobacter spp. The levels of contamination (in CFU/g) varied between commodities and so, evidently, did the real risk for human infections. When antibiotic therapy is needed, quinolone antibiotics cannot be used. Adherence to high standards of consumer safe food handling is crucial for the prevention of diseases.
