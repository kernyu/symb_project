Escherichia coli is a common cause of bovine mastitis, particularly around parturition and early lactation when the host is immunosuppressed. Isolates (n = 37) recovered from cases of clinical mastitis in Ireland were characterised with respect to genotypic diversity, phylogenetic group, virulence gene profile and antimicrobial susceptibility. The isolates were genotypically diverse, belonging to 19 different sequence types. However, the majority (86%) belonged to phylogenetic groups A or B1, groups commonly associated with commensal E. coli. The isolates encoded few virulence genes with iss (increased serum survival, 41%), lpfA (long polar fimbriae, 19%) and astA (enteroaggregative heat-stable toxin, 14%) among the most common virulence genes detected. The only virulence gene to differ in frequency between the phylogenetic groups was lpfA, found exclusively in B1. Resistance to at least one antimicrobial was detected in 16% of isolates. Three isolates were multidrug-resistant, with one resistant to seven antibiotics. There was no relationship between antimicrobial resistance and phylogenetic group. These results indicate that many cases of clinical E. coli mastitis in Ireland may be caused by opportunistic commensal organisms lacking specific virulence genes. However, the organisms represent a reservoir of antimicrobial resistance determinants with the potential to disseminate determinants to other organisms.
