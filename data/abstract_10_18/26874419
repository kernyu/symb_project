A total of 17 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) isolates obtained from 72 cheese samples were included in this study. Coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates obtained in this study comprised 6 (35.3%) Staphylococcus saprophyticus, 3 (17.6%) Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 (11.8%) Staphylococcus hominis, 2 (11.8%) Staphylococcus haemolyticus, 1 (5.9%) Staphylococcus xylosus, 1 (5.9%) Staphylococcus vitulinus, 1 (5.9%) Staphylococcus lentus, and 1 (5.9%) Staphylococcus warneri. The disc diffusion assay revealed that the highest occurrence of resistance was found for penicillin (76.5%), erythromycin (35.3%), tetracycline (29.4%), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (17.6%) among CNS isolates. However, all CNS isolates were found to be susceptible to vancomycin, streptomycin, linezolid, and gentamycin. Of the isolates, 64.7% carried at least one of the following antimicrobial resistance genes: mecA, tet(M), erm(B), blaZ, ant(4')-la, aph(3')-IIIa, and lnu(A). The results suggest that improved hygienic conditions, such as safer handling of raw milk, proper cleaning, and sanitation during the manufacturing in the dairies, are urgently needed in Turkey.
