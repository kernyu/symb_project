Both transgenic as well as traditional breeding approaches have not been completely successful in inducting resistance against geminiviruses in crop plants. This demands the utilization of non-viral, non-plant compounds possessing antiviral characteristics as an alternate and effective strategy for developing durable resistance against geminiviruses. In recent years, several antiviral molecules have been developed for the treatment of plant virus infections. These molecular antiviral compounds target various geminiviral-DNA and -protein via interacting with them or by cleaving viral RNA fragments. Applications of these proteins such as GroEL, g5g and VirE2 have also provided a convincing evidence of resistance against geminiviruses. Taking advantage of this information, we can generate robust resistance against geminiviruses in diverse crop plants. In this context, the present review provides epigrammatic information on these antiviral compounds and their mode of action in modulating virus infection.
