BACKGROUND: The information of the sensitivity pattern of the causative organisms is very important for effective control of septicemia in neonates. OBJECTIVE: To determine the proportion and profile of pathogenic bacteria in the blood cultures of the neonates with clinically suspected septicemia and their susceptibility pattern to antimicrobial agents for developing a unified antibiotic treatment protocol. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted over a period of 3 year and 4 months (39 months). The study included 1000 patients admitted in the selected hospital in Bangladesh. Blood samples for culture were taken aseptically before starting antibiotic therapy. Microorganisms were isolated and identified by standard microbiological processes which include colony morphology, Gram stain, and biochemical profiles. Antimicrobial sensitivity patterns were performed by Kirby-Bauer's disc diffusion method against imipenem, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, chloramphenicol, netilmicin, gentamicin, ceftriaxone, aztreonam, cefotaxime, cephalexin, and ampicillin. RESULTS: Among the patients, 633 (63.3%) were males and 367 (36.7%) were females. Blood cultures were found positive in 194 (19.4%) neonates. The organisms isolated were Pseudomonas spp. (31.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (23.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (12.4%), Escherichia coli (7.2%), Acinatobactor (5.7%), Gram-negative Bacilli (4.1%), Flavobacterium spp. (3.6%), Serratia spp. (5.7%), Citrobacter fruendi (3.1%), Streptococcus species (2.6%), and Enterobacter spp. (1.0%). A majority of the bacterial isolates in neonatal sepsis were found sensitive to imipenem (91.8%) and ciprofloxacin (57.2%) and resistant to commonly used antibiotics, eg. ampicillin (96.4%) and cephalexin (89.2%). CONCLUSION: The problem can be mitigated by careful selection and prudent use of available antibiotics.
