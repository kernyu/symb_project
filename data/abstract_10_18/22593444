BACKGROUND: Exposure to inadequate chemotherapy may alter cancer cell behavior including their metastatic potential. Because the molecular basis of such a phenomenon is largely unclear, we investigated the possible impact of cisplatin on anoikis response on human lung carcinoma cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using molecular and pharmacological tools, Caveolin-1 (CAV1) overexpressing and knock-down H460 cells were generated by stable transfection. The levels of CAV1 were determined by western blotting and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected by specific probes. RESULTS: Sub-toxic concentrations of cisplatin suppressed anoikis response in H460 cells. The anoikis attenuation observed, was found to be caused by CAV1 up-regulation. Exposure to cisplatin induced superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide generation; however, only hydrogen peroxide was found to be responsible for the CAV1 elevation. CONCLUSION: Exposure to cisplatin at sub-toxic concentrations induced hydrogen peroxide generation and the subsequent increase of ROS further regulated CAV1 levels and anoikis resistance. Our findings demonstrate a novel effect of cisplatin treatment on cancer cells which may lead to a better understanding of cancer biology and in the improvement of chemotherapy.
