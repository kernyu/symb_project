INTRODUCTION: The traditional antimicrobial chemotherapy drugs play their effects mostly via bacterial interference with in vivo amino acids, nucleotides, amino sugars and other small molecule synthesis, or interfering the biochemical processes of these small molecules to synthesize nucleic acids, peptidoglycan and other biological macromolecules. In recent years, enzymes with single function in bacterial fatty acid synthetase system have become the genome-driven novel antibacterial drug targets. Among inhibitors of these targets, FabH inhibitors are distinguished, for their target is different from that of existing antibiotics. Therefore, discovery of FabH inhibitors might be a potential orientation to overcome bacterial resistance. AREAS COVERED: This review summarized new patents and articles published on FabH inhibitors from 2000 to 2012. EXPERT OPINION: The review gives a brief understanding about the background and development in the area of FabH inhibitors that aims to solve the bacterial resistance problem. This review puts emphasis on some typical small molecules, which participate in the process of FabH inhibition. Overall, the research scopes of antibacterial agents are getting broad. Fatty acid synthase (FAS) pathway has been proved to be a promising target for the therapy. However, claim of novel antibacterial agents with more active and higher specificity is still continued.
