BACKGROUND: Corticosteroids and azathioprine are widely accepted as the initial therapy for autoimmune hepatitis. However, the disease is refractory to steroids in about 10%-20% of patients, for whom currently there is no standardized treatment. Here we describe our experience with sirolimus in treatment of steroid refractory autoimmune hepatitis. METHODS: This is a longitudinal follow-up study. Between November 2007 and January 2014, 5 subjects with steroid refractory autoimmune hepatitis were treated with sirolimus at our institution. RESULTS: A response, defined as a sustained >50% fall in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, was achieved in 4/5 patients. A complete response, sustained normalization of ALT levels, was achieved in 2/5 patients. The need for steroids was significantly reduced in all patients (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: In this small series, sirolimus appears to be useful in the treatment of patients with steroid refractory autoimmune hepatitis.
