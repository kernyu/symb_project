We report three cases of external ventricular derivation infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative rods and treated successfully with intraventricular colistin. The intrathecal or intraventricular use of colistin have been reported in more than 100 cases without any consensus on dosage, duration and type (monotherapy or combination therapy) of treatment. Based on our comprehensive review of the relevant literature relating to both clinical and pharmacokinetic data, we conclude that the intrathecal/intraventricular administration of colistin is a safe and effective option to treat central nervous system infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.
