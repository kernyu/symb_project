The increasing prevalence of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria is a global health problem that has been exacerbated by the dearth of novel classes of antibiotics entering the clinic over the past 40 years. Herein, we describe recent developments toward combination therapies for the treatment of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. These efforts include antibiotic-antibiotic combinations, and the development of adjuvants that either directly target resistance mechanisms such as the inhibition of beta-lactamase enzymes, or indirectly target resistance by interfering with bacterial signaling pathways such as two-component systems (TCSs). We also discuss screening of libraries of previously approved drugs to identify nonobvious antimicrobial adjuvants.
