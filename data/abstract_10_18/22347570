BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Presence of methicillin and multidrug resistance has associated coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) with high morbidity and mortality worldwide. The present study was carried out to study the susceptibility pattern of CNS to various antimicrobial agents and to determine the prevalence of CNS methicillin resistance in our hospital setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 300 strains of CNS isolated from various clinical specimens were subjected to speciation and their antimicrobial sensitivity testing was studied by Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method. Methicillin resistance was studied by observing minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Oxacillin by macrobroth dilution method and E test. Susceptibility to vancomycin was determined by vancomycin screen agar test and minimum inhibitory concentration by macrobroth dilution test. RESULTS: All the isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, linezolid and teicoplanin in disc diffusion test while maximum resistance was noted against penicillin (100%) followed by ciprofloxacin (36.3%), norfloxacin (34.3%), gentamicin (34%), nitrofurantoin (29.9%), erythromycin (27.9%) and amikacin (22.7%). Fifty two percent (n = 156) of the isolates were found to be resistant to methicillin. A comparison between resistance patterns of methicilin resistant and methicillin sensitive strains showed that methicillin resistant isolates had higher level of resistance to other antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: The high level of resistance among CNS to commonly used antimicrobial agents in our hospital is a matter of great concern and can be prevented by practices of effective infection control measures.
