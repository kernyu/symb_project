In our trial 43 patients with urogenital infections resistant to standard therapy received the same basic therapy (4 tablets of safocid a day for 5 days) which, on demand, was combined with pathogenetic and symptomatic treatment. The effect was achieved by both subjective and objective parameters: pathogenic microflora was not detected after 10 days in 39 (90.7%) patients; none of the patients discharged protozoa, fungi. Tests for chlamidia were negative in all the carriers in 2 months, for ureaplasma--in 94.1% males and 83.3% females, respectively. A significant response was observed in 38 of 43 (88.4%) patients, improvement was seen in 5 (11.6%) patients. The above results persisted for 2 months of follow-up.
