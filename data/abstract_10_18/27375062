Infections caused by Acinetobacter baumannii have become a critical problem for hospital patients worldwide. We investigated the multidrug-resistant A baumannii strain that caused hospital-acquired infections in Uthai Thani Hospital, Thailand, between 2006 and 2014. In summary, the spread of a clonally related multidrug-resistant A baumannii strain was the primary cause of nosocomial infections in Uthai Thani Hospital.
