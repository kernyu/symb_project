Carbapenems are increasingly needed to treat infections caused by drug-resistant gram-negative bacilli (GNB), but carbapenem resistance is increasing. We evaluated the activity of doripenem by broth microdilution against 96 extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from patients with hospital-associated infections. All isolates were non-susceptible to doripenem, but >/= 1 doripenem combination demonstrated synergy (fractional inhibitory concentration index: </= 0.5 for 2 agents, </= 0.75 for 3 agents) against 7 (15%) A. baumannii and 23 (48%) K. pneumoniae isolates; doripenem with rifampin and/or polymyxin B were most active. As doripenem has unique potential for use in prolonged infusions, suggested pharmacodynamic (PD) breakpoints range from 2-8 mug/mL; synergistic activity was found for higher proportions of XDR-GNB at higher PD breakpoints with doripenem with amikacin or with rifampin. The clinical utility of these observations requires further study, as treatment options for XDR-GNB infections are limited.
