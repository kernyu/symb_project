Although nucleotide/side analogs improve the clinical outcome of hepatitis B surface antigen-positive (HBsAg+) kidney transplant recipients (KTR), a significant proportion of subjects have developed resistance to lamivudine (LAM). We retrospectively analyzed the efficacy and tolerability of entecavir (ETV) in HBsAg+ KTR at Queen Mary Hospital during 2005-2013. Twenty-one patients (10 treatment-naive, 11 with LAM resistance) were included (duration of ETV treatment 34.7 +/- 22.9 months, range 6-75 months). ETV treatment led to a decline of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA titer compared to baseline and is more significant in the treatment-naive group (treatment-naive: p = 0.028, <0.001 and <0.001; LAM-resistant p = 0.273, 0.180, and 0.109 after 12, 24, and 36 months). The cumulative rate of HBV DNA undetectability at 12, 24, and 36 months was 60%, 100%, and 100% for treatment-naive group, and 27%, 45%, and 45% for LAM-resistant group, respectively. Time-to-HBV DNA undetectability and time-to-alanine transaminase (ALT) normalization were 15.7 +/- 4.6 and 12.6 +/- 3.7 months for treatment-naive patients, and 24.5 +/- 4.2 and 28.2 +/- 3.5 months for those with LAM resistance. Genotypic resistance to ETV emerged after 20.0 +/- 3.5 months with increase in ALT and HBV DNA in two patients with LAM resistance, but was not observed in the treatment-naive group. Allograft dysfunction, de novo cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma did not occur during follow-up.
