Various thiated analogues of thymine 2',3'-dideoxy-3'-fluoronucleoside (FLT) and their 5'-monophosphates and 5'-triphosphates were prepared with the use of modified multistep procedures. The thiated analogues of FLT and FLTMP were evaluated against the wild type and drug- and multidrug-resistant strains of HIV-1, using the replicative phenotyping format of the deCIPhR assay, and showed potent inhibition of drug-resistant HIV-1 strains at low cytotoxicity. Additionally, inhibition of recombinant drug resistant forms of reverse transcriptase from single and multiple HIV-1 mutants by the synthesized 5'-triphosphates was investigated. The strongest inhibition was observed for K103N and Delta67 mutants and the most potent anti-HIV-1 activity against drug resistant strains and the lowest cytotoxicity was exerted by S4FLTMP and FLTMP which may be regarded as potential anti-HIV/AIDS agents.
