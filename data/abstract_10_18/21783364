In search of potential therapeutics for tuberculosis, we describe herein synthesis and biological evaluation of some substituted 4-arylthiazol-2-amino derivatives as modified analogues of the antiprotozoal drug Nitazoxanide (NTZ), which has recently been reported as potent inhibitor of Mtb H(37)Rv (Mtb MIC=52.12 muM) with an excellent ability to evade resistance. Among the synthesized derivatives, the two compounds 7a (MIC=15.28 muM) and 7c (MIC=17.03 muM) have exhibited about three times better Mtb growth inhibitory activity over NTZ and are free from any cytotoxicity (Vero CC(50) of 244 and 300 muM respectively). These two compounds represent promising leads for further optimization.
