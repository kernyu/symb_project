Rapid diagnostic tests are needed to improve patient care and to combat the problem of antimicrobial resistance. The Accelerate Pheno system (Accelerate Diagnostics, Tucson, Arizona) is a new diagnostic device that can provide rapid bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST) results directly from a positive blood culture. This device was compared against the standard of care at two academic medical centers. There were 298 blood cultures included in this study and the Accelerate Pheno system provided a definitive identification result in 218 instances (73.2%). The Accelerate Pheno system provided a definitive and correct result for 173 runs (58.1%). The Accelerate Pheno system demonstrated an overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 94.7%, 98.9%, 83.7%, and 99.7%, respectively. An AST result was available for analysis in 146 instances. The overall category agreement was 94.1% with 12 very major errors, 5 major errors, and 55 minor errors. After a discrepancy analysis, there were 5 very major errors and 4 major errors. The Accelerate Pheno system provided an identification result in 1.4 hours and an AST result in 6.6 hours; this identification and AST result was 41.5 hours and 48.4 hours faster than standard of care, respectively. This study demonstrated that the Accelerate Pheno system is able to provide fast and accurate organism identification and AST data. A limitation is the frequency with which cultures would require alternative identification and AST methods.
