Phanerochaete chrysosporium has been identified as an effective bioremediation agent for its biosorption and degradation ability. However, the applications of P. chrysosporium are limited owing to its long degradation time and low resistance to pollutants. In this research, nitrogen-doped TiO2 nanoparticles were loaded on P. chrysosporium to improve the remediation capacity for pollutants. The removal efficiencies were maintained at a high level: 84.2% for Cd(II) and 78.9% for 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) in the wide pH range of 4.0 to 7.0 in 60 h. The removal capacity of immobilized P. chrysosporium loaded with nitrogen-doped TiO2 nanoparticles (PTNs) was strongly affected by the initial Cd(II) and 2,4-DCP concentrations. The hyphae of PTNs became tight, and a large amount of crystals adhered to them after the reaction. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that carboxyl, amino, and hydroxyl groups on the surface of PTNs were responsible for the biosorption. In the degradation process, 2,4-DCP was broken down into o-chlorotoluene and 4-hexene-1-ol. These results showed that PTNs is promising for simultaneous removal of Cd(II) and 2,4-DCP from wastewater.
