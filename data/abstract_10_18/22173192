C. jejuni as well as some hippurate-negative Campylobacter species and related diarrheagenic organisms, are the leading cause of gastroenteritis in our environment all throughout the year. The aim of the present study was to determine the sensitivity of hippurate-negative Campylobacter and Helicobacter pullorum strains isolated from the stools of patients with diarrhea. We tested 39 Campylobacter coli, two C. lari and five Helicobacter pullorum strains identified by mass spectrometry analysis. The sensitivity to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, erytrhomycin, azithromycin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, tetracycline, tigecycline and chloramphenicol was tested by E-test. Most hippurate-negative Campylobacter and H. pullorum isolates studied showed high resistance to tetracycline and to the two fluorquinolones tested. On the other side, all strains were sensitive to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, tigecycline and chloramphenicol, while most of them were sensitive to both macrolides tested and to gentamicin.
