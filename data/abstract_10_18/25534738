Point mutations conferring resistance to fluoroquinolones were introduced in the gyr genes of the reference strain Clostridium difficile 630. Only mutants with the substitution Thr-82-->Ile in GyrA, which characterizes the hypervirulent epidemic clone III/027/NAP1, were resistant to all fluoroquinolones tested. The absence of a fitness cost in vitro for the most frequent mutations detected in resistant clinical isolates suggests that resistance will be maintained even in the absence of antibiotic pressure.
