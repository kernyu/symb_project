Patients with hematologic malignancies as well as allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) patients are at high risk for invasive aspergillosis. Here, we report a culture- and autopsy-proven fatal invasive aspergillosis in an allogeneic HSTC patient which he developed despite posaconazole prophylaxis. The agent was determined to be an azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus strain bearing the cyp51A mutation combination TR46 Y121F M172I T289A. At increasing frequency, the azole resistance of A. fumigatus is being reported globally, limiting treatment options and complicating regimens.
