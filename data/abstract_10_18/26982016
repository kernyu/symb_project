The multidrug-resistant Enterococcus faecium 17i48, sequence type 17, from marine sediment, carrying erm(B), tet(M), and tet(L) genes, was analyzed for the presence of antibiotic resistance plasmids and for the ability to transfer resistance genes. The strain was found to harbor the replicon type (repA) of pRE25, pRUM, pHTbeta, and the axe-txe toxin-antitoxin (TA) system. In mating experiments, tet(M) and tet(L) were cotransferred with the repApRE25, whereas erm(B) was consistently cotransferred with the axe-txe and repApRUM, suggesting that tetracycline and erythromycin resistance genes were carried on different elements both transferable by conjugation, likely via pHTbeta-mediated mobilization. Hybridization and PCR mapping demonstrated that tet(M) and tet(L) were located in tandem on a pDO1-like plasmid that also carried the repApRE25, whereas erm(B) was carried by a pRUM-like plasmid. Sequencing of the latter plasmid showed a high nucleotide identity with pRUM and the presence of cat, aadE, sat4, and a complete aphA resistance genes. These findings show that the genetic features of E. faecium 17i48 are consistent with a hospital-adapted clone and suggest that antibiotic resistance may spread in the environment, also in the absence of antibiotic pressure, due to TA system plasmid maintenance.
