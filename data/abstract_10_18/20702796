Despite numerous clinical studies supporting a link between type 2 diabetes (T2D) and Parkinson's disease (PD), the clinical literature remains equivocal. We, therefore, sought to address the relationship between insulin resistance and nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) in a preclinical animal model. High-fat feeding in rodents is an established model of insulin resistance, characterized by increased adiposity, systemic oxidative stress, and hyperglycemia. We subjected rats to a normal chow or high-fat diet for 5 wk before infusing 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the medial forebrain bundle. Our goal was to determine whether a high-fat diet and the resulting peripheral insulin resistance would exacerbate 6-OHDA-induced nigrostriatal DA depletion. Prior to 6-OHDA infusion, animals on the high-fat diet exhibited greater body weight, increased adiposity, and impaired glucose tolerance. Two weeks after 6-OHDA, locomotor activity was tested, and brain and muscle tissue was harvested. Locomotor activity did not differ between the groups nor did cholesterol levels or measures of muscle atrophy. High-fat-fed animals exhibited higher homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) values and attenuated insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in fast-twitch muscle, indicating decreased insulin sensitivity. Animals in the high-fat group also exhibited greater DA depletion in the substantia nigra and the striatum, which correlated with HOMA-IR and adiposity. Decreased phosphorylation of HSP27 and degradation of IkappaBalpha in the substantia nigra indicate increased tissue oxidative stress. These findings support the hypothesis that a diet high in fat and the resulting insulin resistance may lower the threshold for developing PD, at least following DA-specific toxin exposure.
