Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21), which is a modulator of glucose and lipid homeostasis, acts as a novel therapeutic reagent for many metabolic perturbations. However, its potential as a treatment for cardiovascular disease, especially atherosclerosis (AS) has not been fully explored. Here, we report that recombinant FGF-21 improves resistance to cell damage from oxidative stress in vitro, and from atherosclerosis in vivo. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were induced with H2O2, followed by treatment with high purity recombinant FGF-21. The results indicated that FGF-21 significantly enhanced cell viability and decreased the degree of DNA fragmentation in HUVECs, as caused by H2O2 stress induction. Further studies revealed that FGF-21 inhibited H2O2-induced cell apoptosis by preventing the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. In an established rat model, FGF-21 dramatically improved the condition of atherosclerotic rats by decreasing serum levels of total triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and total cholesterol (TC), and by increasing the serum levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). FGF-21 also has antioxidant effects in the atherosclerotic rat, such that increased levels of superoxide dismutase, reduced glutathione, and reduced malondialdehyde were observed. These data provide novel insight into the potential use of FGF-21 in the prevention and treatment of human cardiovascular diseases.
