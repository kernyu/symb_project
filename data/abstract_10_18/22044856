BACKGROUND: We devised an open-label, randomized trial to evaluate whether therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of protease inhibitors (PIs) and dose escalation based upon a normalized inhibitory quotient (NIQ), which integrates PI trough concentration and drug resistance, could improve virologic outcome in PI-experienced patients with treatment failure. Secondary analyses through 48 weeks are presented. METHODS: Eligible HIV-infected subjects with a screening viral load of >/= 1000 copies/mL initiated a new PI-based regimen at entry and had NIQ performed at week 2. Subjects with an NIQ </=1 were randomized at week 4 to a standard-of-care (SOC) arm or TDM arm featuring PI dose escalation. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-three subjects were randomized. There was no significant treatment difference in change from randomization to week 48 in HIV-1 RNA [ P = .13, median (25th, 75th percentile log10 copies/mL change): -0.03 (-0.74, 0.62) with TDM and 0.11 (-2.3, 0.82) with SOC]. In subgroup analysis, patients with >/= 0.69 active PIs benefited from TDM compared to those with <0.69 active PIs ( P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: While the TDM strategy of PI dose escalation did not improve virologic response at week 48 overall, in subgroup analysis, TDM favorably impacted virologic outcome in subjects taking PI-based regimens with moderate antiviral activity.
