Eight Staphylococcus aureus isolates collected from 117 wild boars were characterized and compared to livestock isolates. They belonged to sequence types ST133, ST425, and the new type ST1643. The spa types were t1181, t6782, and the new types t6384, t6385, and t6386. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing and microarray-based genotyping confirmed the absence of important virulence/resistance genes.
