PURPOSE: To explore cancer stem cell susceptibility to a host's cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response. METHODS: We compared the susceptibility of putative CSC generated from cancer cell lines to immunologic recognition and killing by alloantigen-specific CD8(+) CTL. CSC-enriched spheroid culture-derived cells (SDC) exhibited higher expression of ALDH, ICAM1 and of stem/progenitor cell markers on all 3 tumor cell lines investigated and lower MHC class I on the cervical cancer cell line as compared to their monolayer-derived cells (MDC). RESULTS: The expression of ICAM1 and MHCI was upregulated by IFN-gamma treatment. CSC populations were less sensitive to MHC class I-restricted alloantigen-specific CD8(+) CTL lysis as compared to matched MDC. IFN-gamma pretreatment resulted in over-proportionally enhanced lysis of SDC. Finally, the subset of ALDH(high) expressing SDC presented more sensitivity toward CD8(+) CTL killing than the ALDH(low) SDC. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor therapy resistance has been attributed to cancer stem cells (CSC). We show in vitro susceptibility of CSC to CTL-mediated lysis. Immunotherapy targeting of ALDH(+) CSC may therefore be a promising approach. Our results and method may be helpful for the development and optimization of adjuvants, as here exemplified for INF-gamma, for CSC-targeted vaccines, independent of the availability of CSC-specific antigens.
