The global spread of antimicrobial resistance has limited the availability of antimicrobial agents to treat infections that affect immunocompromised hosts. Efforts to optimize the selection, dosing, and duration of antimicrobial therapy to improve patient outcomes and minimize selective pressure on antimicrobial resistance are relevant to immunocompromised patients. Collaborative efforts between health care providers with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with various degrees of immunosuppression are pivotal for the success of antimicrobial stewardship programs in immunocompromised patients.
