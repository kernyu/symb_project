Escherichia coli is a natural colonizer of the urogenital mucosa of healthy females; however it is one of the pathogens associated to reproductive failures in cows and sows. A better knowledge about the characteristics of native E. coli will allow us to differentiate them from pathogenic strains. Ninety autochthonous isolates from the reproductive tract of sows and cows were characterized to determine the phylogenetic profile, antibiotic resistance and virulence factors; also, comparisons between different breeding systems were performed. Vaginal colonization of E. coli was statistically higher in cows (57.5%) than sows (23.8%), and most isolates belonged to the phylogenetic group A: 79.69 and 80.77%, respectively; moreover phylo-groups B1 (12.5 and 11.54%) and D (7.81 and 7.69%) were significantly lower; however, none was classified as B2. Positive associations between virulence factors and group D were found. Isolates with antimicrobial susceptibility were associated with group A and the MDR (Multiple Drug Resistance) was related to the porcine source. These results contribute to the knowledge of extra-intestinal E. coli populations; which could affect the reproductive performance of females.
