In Crohn's disease (CD), hierarchical architecture of the inflammatory network, including subordination of IL-18, an IFN-gamma-inducing cytokine, to the inflammasome, have remained undeciphered. Heterogeneity among patients of such a subordination cannot be evaluated by animal models, monofactorial in their etiology and homogenous in disease progression. To address these issues, we set up an ex vivo model of inflamed mucosa explant cultures from patients with active long-standing CD. Th1 cytokine production, especially IFN-gamma and IL-18, was assessed in relation with inflammation intensity. Subordination of the Th1 response to caspase-1, effector of the inflammasome, was determined in explant cultures subjected to pharmacological inhibition of caspase-1 by YVAD. We showed a correlation between secreted IFN-gamma/IL-18 levels, and caspase-1 activation, with inflammation intensity of intestinal CD mucosa explants. Inhibition of caspase-1 activation using the specific inhibitor YVAD identified a homogenous non responder group featuring a caspase-1-independent IL-18/IFN-gamma response, and a heterogenous responder group, in which both IL-18 and IFN-gamma responses were caspase-1-dependent, with a 40-70% range of inhibition by YVAD. These findings bring out the concept of heterogeneity of subordination of the Th1 response to inflammasome activation among CD patients. This ex vivo model should have therapeutic relevance in allowing to determine eligibility of CD patients for new targeted therapies.
