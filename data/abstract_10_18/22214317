Bacterial skin and soft tissues infections (SSTI) often determine acute disease and frequent emergency recovering, and they are one of the most common causes of infection among groups of different ages. Given the variable presentation of SSTI, a thorough assessment of their incidence and prevalence is difficult. The presence of patient-related (local or systemic) or environmental risk factors, along with the emergence of multi-drug resistant pathogens, can promote SSTI. These infections may present with a wide spectrum of clinical features and different severity, and can be classified according to various criteria. Many bacterial species can cause SSTI, but Gram-positive bacteria are the most frequently isolated, with a predominance of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. The diagnosis of SSTI requires an extended clinical history, a thorough physical examination and a high index of suspicion. Early diagnosis is particularly important in complicated infections, which often require laboratory studies, diagnostic imaging and surgical exploration. SSTI management should conform to the epidemiology, the aetiology, the severity and the depth of the infection. Topical, oral or systemic antimicrobial therapy and drainage or debridement could be necessary, along with treatment of a significant underlying disease. This review discusses the epidemiology, the pathogenesis and the classification of bacterial SSTI, describes their associated risk factors and their clinical presentations. The authors provide a rational diagnostic and therapeutic approach to SSTI in respect of antibiotic resistance and currently available antimicrobial agents.
