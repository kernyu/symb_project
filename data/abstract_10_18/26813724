OBJECTIVE: To investigate the drug resistance of HIV patients to the HIV-1 CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC strains in Sichuan province during 2010 to 2013. METHODS: 1.5 ml of plasma were collected from AIDS patients who had been receiving anti-retroviral treatment for over 6 months but still had a HIV-1 virus load of over 1 000 copies/ml from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2013 in Sichuan province. Genetic analysis of the HIV-1 pol gene was performed using self-established method, and patients with a positive drug-resistant HIV-1 pol gene mutation were included. HIV-1 poly gene was successfully sequenced for a total of 1 213 patients. Drug resistance of different HIV-1 strains was compared with chi2 test or Fisher exact test. RESULTS: 558 cases (46.0%) of the 1 213 successfully sequenced patients were infected by HIV-1-strains with drug-resistant mutations, including 327 cases (58.6%) infected by CRF01_AE strain, 126 (22.6%) by CRF07_BC strain, 46 (8.2%) by CRF08_BC strain, 33 (5.9%) by B strain, 4 (0.7%) by C strain, 1 (0.2%) by CRF02_AG strain, and 21 (3.8%) by unidentified strains. Drug-resistant mutation analysis revealed that L33, F116, L74, Q151, and T69 resistance mutations occurred only in the CRF01_AE strain, while A71, K43, and Q58 resistance mutations occurred only in the CRF07_BC strain; in nuclear nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), CRF01_AE subtype strains showed highly resistant rate were higher than CRF07_BC, CRF08_BC and B subtype strains, with the differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The drug-resistant HIV-1 strains in Sichuan mainly included the CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC strains, which had different resistance mutations.
