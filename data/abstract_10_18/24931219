Although Aspergillus infections pose a growing threat to immunocompromised individuals, the limited range of existing drugs does not allow efficient management of invasive aspergillosis. Moreover, drug resistance is becoming increasingly common. Given that drug discovery relies on high-quality animal studies, careful design of in vivo models for invasive aspergillosis could facilitate the identification of novel antifungals. In this review, we discuss key aspects of animal models for invasive aspergillosis, covering laboratory animal species, immune modulation, inoculation routes, Aspergillus strains, treatment strategies and efficacy assessment, to enable the reader to tailor specific protocols for different types of preclinical antifungal evaluation study.
