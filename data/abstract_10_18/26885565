The current study was carried out to estimate Salmonella spp. contamination of duck carcasses and to determine the antibiotic susceptibility profiles and serotype distribution of the isolates. Salmonella spp. was detected in 21.7% (26/120) of fresh raw duck carcasses sampled at different slaughterhouses in South Korea. Eight Salmonella serovars were identified; the most prevalent serovar was S. Typhimurium (34.6%), followed by S. Virchow (30.8%). All isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic, and five remarkable isolates were resistant to more than 10 antibiotics, including third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins. Additional phenotypic and genetic characterization demonstrated that these isolates harbored resistance genes to broad-spectrum beta-lactams, blaCTX-M-15 and blaCMY-2 genes, among the most prevalent beta-lactamase enzymes worldwide. Based on molecular subtyping performed using the DiversiLab automated repetitive-sequence-based PCR system, isolates were classified into cluster A and cluster B. Among beta-lactamase-producing Salmonellas, the isolate showing >98% similarity in their repetitive-sequence-based PCR banding pattern seemed to have acquired the resistance gene (blaCMY-2) and thus a distinct multiresistance profile. Given that antibiotic-resistant genes might be transferred by plasmid-mediated conjugation, periodic microbiological assessment within slaughterhouses is recommended for pathogens not to be transmitted through cross-contamination during slaughtering and dressing.
