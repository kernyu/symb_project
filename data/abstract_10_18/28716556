BACKGROUND: The use of PCV7 for children immunization was gradually implemented in the Italian regions starting from 2006 and was replaced by PCV13 in 2010-2011. In this study we aimed to assess the PCV impact on invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD) incidence, serotype distribution and antibiotic resistance in Italian children under 5years old. METHODS: All IPD cases in children from 5 Italian regions (Emilia-Romagna, Lombardia, A. P. Bolzano, A. P. Trento, and Piemonte) reported through the nationwide surveillance system during 2008-2014 were included in this study. Pneumococcal isolates were subjected to serotyping, antibiotic susceptibility testing, and clonal analysis according to standard methods. RESULTS: During the study period overall IPD incidence decreased from 7.8 cases/100,000 inhabitants in 2008 to 3.0 cases/100,000 in 2014 (61% decrease, P<0.001). In particular, from 2008 to 2014, PCV7-type IPD decreased from 2.92 to 0.13 cases/100,000 inhabitants (95% decrease, P<0.001) while PCV13-non-PCV7 type IPD decreased from 3.2 to 0.89 cases/100,000 inhabitants (72% decrease, P=0.008). Conversely, non-vaccine serotype (NVS) IPD increased overtime, becoming more common than PCV13 serotype IPD in 2013-2014. Emergent NVS 24F and 12F were the most prevalent in 2014. Antibiotic resistance testing revealed an overall increasing trend in penicillin resistance, from 14% in 2008 to 23% in 2014. Erythromycin resistance showed a downward trend, from 38% in 2008 to 27% in 2014. While in 2008 PCV13 serotypes were the major responsible for antibiotic resistance, during the following years antimicrobial resistance due to NVS increased, mainly as a result of expansion of pre-existing clones. CONCLUSIONS: Both PCVs led to a substantial decrease in vaccine-related IPD incidence in the children population. However NVS-related IPD increased, becoming the most prevalent in the last two-years period. Continuous surveillance is an essential tool to monitor evolution of pneumococcal population causing IPD in children.
