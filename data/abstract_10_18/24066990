BACKGROUND: In the past, Neisseria gonorrhoeae has developed resistance to antimicrobial agents used for its treatment. Consequently, extended-spectrum cephalosporins form the mainstay of treatment for gonorrhoea. METHODS: Samples from 88 patients attending the sexually transmitted diseases clinics from December 2009 to January 2011 in two referral hospitals in New Delhi were studied. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done using the disc diffusion method as per the calibrated dichotomous sensitivity technique against the following antibiotics: penicillin (0.5 i.u.), tetracycline (10 mug), nalidixic acid (30 mug), ciprofloxacin (1 mug), spectinomycin (100 mug), ceftriaxone (0.5 mug) and cefpodoxime (10 mug) (Oxoid UK). Azithromycin (15 mug) (Oxoid, UK) was tested as per the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined using the Etest for penicillin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, spectinomycin and azithromycin as per the manufacturer's instruction (Biomerieux, France). RESULTS: Eighteen isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae were obtained. Three of these had decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone and cefpodoxime by the disc diffusion method. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of ceftriaxone for two isolates were 0.064 mug/ml and for one isolate it was 0.125 mug/ml. CONCLUSION: Higher minimum inhibitory concentrations to extended-spectrum cephalosporins is of concern as it has been shown to precede treatment failure. This may warrant its use in increased/multiple dosages alone or possibly in combination (dual therapy), thereby complicating effective disease control. Our report is in accordance with earlier reports from different parts of the world. Therefore, a continuous surveillance of antimicrobial resistance is crucial to tailor treatment schedules for Neisseria gonorrhoeae in a particular geographical region.
