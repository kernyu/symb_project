We investigated the susceptibility to conventional and newer antimycobacterial agents including rifabutin (RBT) and novel fluoroquinolones (NFQs) among 48 clinical Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) isolates from patients with sputum culture-positive MAC disease who were undergoing standard chemotherapy. RBT and NFQs were superior to conventional agents because of higher rates of susceptibility and lower minimum inhibitory concentration. NFQs showed cross-resistance among quinolones. In contrast, RBT did not show cross-resistance to RFP. Most clarithromycin-resistant or rifampicin-resistant cases were susceptible to RBT and NFQs. In conclusion, RBT and NFQs possess good in vitro antimicrobial activity among clinical isolates of culture-positive pulmonary MAC disease, which suggests that a combination of such microbiologically active agents may improve clinical effectiveness more than standard chemotherapy regimens.
