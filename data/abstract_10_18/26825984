BACKGROUND: Aeromonas species can cause a wide spectrum of illnesses varying from intestinal to extra intestinal and vary in their susceptibility to different antibiotics. The current study was undertaken to characterize the third generation cephalosporin-resistant strains of Aeromonas spp. which were isolated from stool specimens. METHODS: Out of a total of 2780 stool samples, 29 Aeromonas spp. were identified, out of which, 9 were resistant to ceftriaxone by the Kirby-Bauer antibiotic testing method. These strains were subjected to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination by agar dilution for ceftriaxone. Phenotypic and genotypic testing of AmpC beta-lactamase and extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) were performed. Gene transfer was carried out to demonstrate transmissibility of these genetic elements by conjugation experiments. RESULTS: Out of the 29 strains, 9 showed MIC of >/=4 mug/ml. Seven out of 9 showed presence of blaCTX-M, while 2 more strains showed the presence of inducible AmpC beta-lactamase and presence of MOX gene. Gene transfer experiments showed that these elements were transmissible to recipient (Escherichia coli J53 strain) in the presence of ceftriaxone. CONCLUSIONS: Dissemination of these resistance determinants like plasmids is pivotal in the spread of these resistance genes into the aquatic environment into organisms like Aeromonas. This may further limit the future use of antibiotics for the treatment of diarrhoeal diseases. Hence, detection and antibiotic susceptibility testing of Aeromonas spp. should be performed when isolated from stool samples.
