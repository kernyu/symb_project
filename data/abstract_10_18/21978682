Thirty-one N(4)-mono alkyl derivatives of novel glycopeptide LYV07ww01 were synthesized by the reductive alkylation and their in vitro antibacterial activity was tested. The benzyl derivatives showed potent activity, especially against vancomycin-resistant enterococci and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae.
