Environmental biotic stress factors act continuously on plants, through multiple molecular interactions that eventually lead to the establishment and progress of symbiotic or pathogenic complex interactions. Proteins and peptides play noteworthy roles in such biological processes, usually being the main effectors since the initial recognizing and elicitor functions until the following transduction, gene regulation and physiological responses activities. Ranging from specific regulators to direct antimicrobial agents, plant or pathogen proteins and peptides comprise the arsenal available to each side in this biological war, resulting from the genetic coding potential inherited by each one. Post-translational research tools have widely contributed with valuable information on how the plant proteome works to achieve, maintain and adjust plant immunity in order to properly cope with the challenging pathogenic derived proteomes. These key proteins and peptides have great biotechnological potential since they represent distinctive features of each pathogen group (fungi, bacteria, viruses and other) in response to molecules of defense of host plants.
