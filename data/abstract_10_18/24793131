Maggot debridement therapy plays an important role in treatment of diabetic foot ulcers and other chronic infectious wounds, cause of this is its extremely low drug resistance. However, the microbe stimulated maggot, we may call it a derivative of normal sterile maggot, could exhibit stronger bacterial or bactericidal effects. Methods of the pretreatment on maggot was different germ solution were artificially mixed and added with originally sterile maggots, the novel secretions were collected. Some of this have been demonstrated by plate test and telescope analysis. Thus, we hypothesize that maggot especially the larvae of Lucilia sericata was conducted as the germ irritant receptor, and diverse germs interacted with it, at last, novel secretions/excretions we got will offer a great help to the general surgery clinicians as well as researchers who are interested in novel antibiotics discovery.
