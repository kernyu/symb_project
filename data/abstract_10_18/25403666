The prevalence of carbapenemase enzymes continues to increase. Among the Ambler class B enzymes is the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM). This particular enzyme is capable of hydrolyzing nearly all beta-lactam antimicrobial agents and has spread rapidly, becoming a global problem. Therapeutic treatment options for patients infected with isolates which produce this enzyme are difficult to manage, as cross-resistance to other antimicrobial classes is common. The Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART) is a global surveillance study evaluating the antimicrobial susceptibilities of numerous Gram-negative bacterial species recovered from people with intra-abdominal and urinary tract infections. The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute methods and a molecular analysis identified 134 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae (nine species) and one Acinetobacter sp. with blaNDM genes. These isolates were collected in nine countries, and >95% of the isolates possessed the NDM-1 variant. The MIC90 values were >4 mg/liter and >8 mg/liter for ertapenem and imipenem, respectively. No tested beta-lactam or beta-lactamase inhibitor combination had activity against these isolates. Resistance to amikacin (79.9%) and levofloxacin (82.8%) was common. Nearly all the isolates encoded additional enzymes, including AmpC cephalosporinases and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. There is an urgent need for infection control and continued global monitoring of isolates which harbor the NDM enzyme, as evidenced by recent outbreaks.
