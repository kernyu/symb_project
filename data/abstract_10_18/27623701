OBJECTIVES: External ventricular drain (EVD)-related infection is a significant source of morbidity in neurosurgical patients. Recently, there has been a drive to adopt new catheters with bactericidal properties to reduce infection rates. We propose that the use of standard catheters combined with pre-emptive intrathecal vancomycin (ITV) 10 mg daily provides an effective alternative. DESIGN: Retrospective study of all patients with EVDs between 2010 and 2012, comparing infection rates in those who did and did not receive pre-emptive ITV. All EVDs were of the standard silicon catheter type. CSF infection was defined, as per Centre for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines, as clinical suspicion +/- positive CSF gram stain/culture or leucocytosis. Infection rates were compared using Pearson's chi-squared test. RESULTS: 262 EVDs were included in the study, of which 111 were managed with pre-emptive ITV. The infection rate was 2.7% in the vancomycin group and 11.9% in the control group (p<.01). There were no cases of vancomycin-resistant infection in either group. CONCLUSION: The use of pre-emptive ITV is associated with a significantly lower EVD infection rate. This compares favourably with those reported in the literature for bactericidal catheters.
