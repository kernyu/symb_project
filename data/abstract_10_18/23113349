Pseudomonads' IncP-7 plasmids make significant contribution to the environmental biodegradative potential and sometimes harbour antibiotic resistance genes. More than 30 years plasmid Rms148 is used as archetypal P-7 plasmid in microbiological incompatibility tests. However, the structure of its basic replicon was not described up to now, as well as phylogenetic relationships between all known plasmids within the IncP-7 group were not studied. In the frames of this work we have constructed two primer pairs to amplify main components of P-7 replication initiation region, and subsequent screening of repA intragenic polymorphism was made using laboratory collection of IncP-7 plasmids. Minimal replicon of Rms148 was constructed and its nucleotide sequence was determined to be identical to repA-oriVof known P-7 plasmids on 81-83% and forming separate branch on appropriate phylogenetic tree. Additionally, repA seems to be more conservative between group members compared with putative oriV region. Deduced amino acid sequence and predicted secondary and tertiary structures of Rms148 RepA protein allow us to make assumption about similar to unclassified cryptic plasmid pPS10 model of replication initiation for IncP-7 group members.
