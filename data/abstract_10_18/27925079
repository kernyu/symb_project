Objective:: to monitor bacterial strains of Staphylococcus aureus that are resistant or not to oxacillin in nursing undergraduate students, with an emphasis on the process of colonization. Method:: cross-sectional prevalence study carried out with 138 nursing students. The biological samples of the nasal cavity were collected in June 2015, by means of sterile swabs, which were subsequently submitted to confirmatory tests of catalase and coagulase. Isolated Staphylococcus aureus had their sensitivity profile determined by means of the Kirby Bauer method. Descriptive, univariate and bivariate analyses were performed. Results:: the prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus was 21.7. Regarding the resistance profile, 24.1% of strains were resistant to oxacillin, with ampicillin being the antimicrobial with the greatest resistance (82.8%). Conclusion:: the nasal cavity is an important bacterial flora of S. aureus in nursing students. The profile of isolated strains highlights the increase of Staphylococcus aureus resistance to antimicrobials such as oxacillin.
