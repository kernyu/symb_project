OBJECTIVES: We aim to further define the impact of the mechanism of fluoroquinolone resistance and inoculum load on the pharmacodynamic effects of levofloxacin and moxifloxacin on Streptococcus pneumoniae. METHODS: The antibacterial effects of and emergence of resistance (EoR) to moxifloxacin (400 mg once daily) or levofloxacin (750 mg once daily or 500 mg twice daily) were compared using five S. pneumoniae strains containing no known resistance mechanisms, efflux resistance mechanisms, a parC mutation or parC and gyrA mutations, at high (10(8) cfu/mL) and low (10(6) cfu/mL) inocula. An in vitro pharmacokinetic model was used and simulations were performed over 96 h. After drug exposure, isolates were tested for the presence of efflux pumps and mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions. RESULTS: A high inoculum diminished the antibacterial effect of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin. Levofloxacin at both dosages produced EoR with all strains. Levofloxacin regimens with AUC/MIC ratios <100 produced EoR. Moxifloxacin produced EoR with the parC strain only. CONCLUSIONS: Levofloxacin dosing regimens with low AUC/MIC ratios select for efflux pump overexpression, leading to fluoroquinolone resistance. Levofloxacin dosing may select for gyrA mutations, inducing moxifloxacin resistance. These data confirm that a fluoroquinolone AUC/MIC ratio of >100 is required for prevention of EoR.
