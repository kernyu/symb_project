In this study, we determined the presence of class 1 integron-integrase gene in culturable heterotrophic bacteria isolated from river water and sediment sampled upstream and downstream of a wastewater treatment plant effluent discharge. Moreover, we quantified intI1 and sulfonamide resistance genes (sul1 and sul2) in the water and sediment using qPCR. There was no correlation between the results from water and sediment samples, which suggests integron-containing bacteria are differentially retained in these two environmental compartments. The discharge of treated wastewater significantly increased the frequency of intI1 among culturable bacteria and the gene copy number in river water, and increased the number of sul1 genes in the sediment. We also observed seasonal differences in the frequency of the class 1 integron-integrase gene among culturable heterotrophs as well as intI1 copy number in water, but not in sediment. The results suggest that the abundance of class 1 integrons in aquatic habitat depends on anthropogenic pressure and environmental factors.
