Emphysematous pyelonephritis (EPN) is a rare occurrence in renal allografts. An aggressive approach resulting in transplant nephrectomy is viewed as the standard of care. Over the recent years, treatment with percutaneous drainage (PCD) of the renal and perinephric collections and appropriate antibiotics has been reported with good success in lesser grades of this infection. Only 4 cases of extensive EPN disease with Escherichia coli, treated with conservative management, are reported in the English-language literature. We present a case of severe EPN caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, successfully managed with early PCD, and propose a step-up strategy aimed toward graft preservation.
