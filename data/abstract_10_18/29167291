Candida auris has emerged globally as a multidrug-resistant health care-associated fungal pathogen. Recent reports highlight ongoing challenges due to organism misidentification, high rates of antifungal drug resistance, and significant patient mortality. The predilection for transmission within and between health care facilities possibly promoted by virulence factors that facilitate skin colonization and environmental persistence is unique among Candida species. This minireview details the global emergence of C. auris and discusses issues relevant to clinical microbiology laboratories, hospital infection control, and antimicrobial stewardship efforts.
