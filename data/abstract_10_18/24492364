Data regarding the effect of the CYP2B6 18492T-->C polymorphism on plasma efavirenz concentrations and 96-week virologic responses in patients coinfected with HIV and tuberculosis (TB) are still unavailable. A total of 139 antiretroviral-naive HIV-infected adults with active TB were prospectively enrolled to receive efavirenz 600 mg-tenofovir 300 mg-lamivudine 300 mg. Eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within CYP2B6 were genotyped. Seven SNPs, including 64C-->T, 499C-->G, 516G-->T, 785A-->G, 1375A-->G, 1459C-->T, and 21563C-->T, were included for CYP2B6 haplotype determination. The CYP2B6 18492T-->C polymorphism was studied in 48 patients who carried haplotype *1/*1. At 12 and 24 weeks after antiretroviral therapy, plasma efavirenz concentrations at 12 h after dosing were measured. Plasma HIV RNA was monitored every 12 weeks for 96 weeks. Of 48 patients {body weight [mean+/-standard deviation (SD)], 56+/-10 kg}, 77% received a rifampin-containing anti-TB regimen. No drug resistance-associated mutation was detected at baseline. The frequencies of the wild type (18492TT) and the heterozygous (18492TC) and homozygous (18492CC) mutants of the CYP2B6 18492T-->C polymorphism were 39%, 42%, and 19%, respectively. At 12 weeks, mean (+/-SD) efavirenz concentrations of patients who carried the 18492TT, 18492TC, and 18492CC mutants were 2.8+/-1.6, 1.7+/-0.9, and 1.4+/-0.5 mg/liter, respectively (P=0.005). At 24 weeks, the efavirenz concentrations of the corresponding groups were 2.4+/-0.8, 1.7+/-0.8, and 1.2+/-0.4 mg/liter, respectively (P=0.003). A low efavirenz concentration was independently associated with 18492T-->C (beta=-0.937, P=0.004) and high body weight (beta=-0.032, P=0.046). At 96 weeks, 19%, 17%, and 28% of patients carrying the 18492TT, 18492TC, and 18492CC mutants, respectively, had plasma HIV RNA levels of >40 copies/ml and developed efavirenz-associated mutations (P=0.254). In summary, the CYP2B6 18492T-->C polymorphism compromises efavirenz concentrations in patients who carry CYP2B6 haplotype *1/*1 and are coinfected with HIV and tuberculosis.
