Strategies to control biofouling without using antimicrobial chemicals are needed to prevent the spread of antibiotic resistance genes and disruption of microbial activities in biological treatment. This study developed an environmentally friendly biofouling resistant membrane by incorporating d-tyrosine onto a commercial nanofiltration membrane using FAU type zeolite nanoparticles that covalently bound to the membrane surface as carriers for slow release. The d-tyrosine loaded membrane had similar water permeability as the unmodified membrane, but greatly reduced initial cell attachment and strongly inhibited subsequent biofilm formation without inactivating the bacteria. The membrane slowly released d-tyrosine in the time course of over 5 days, and retained its anti-biofouling capability in repeated 24 h efficacy tests for as long as 6 days. In nanofiltration operation, the d-tyrosine incorporated zeolite coating completely inhibited cell adhesion on the membrane surface and significantly alleviated membrane flux decline.
