Candidiasis is the most frequent infection by opportunistic fungi, frequently caused by Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, Candida glabrata, and Candida krusei. Mentha arvensis L. is a herbaceous plant that occurs throughout South America and is used as a tea and in the folk medicine. Turnera ulmifolia L. is already known to be of medicinal value. Ethanol extracts from M. arvensis and T. ulmifolia were assayed for antifungal activity against strains of C. albicans, C. tropicalis, and C. krusei. No clinically relevant antifungal activity was demonstrated by the extracts; however, a potentiation effect was observed when the extracts were applied with metronidazole against C. tropicalis. M. arvensis and T. ulmifolia could represent a source of natural products with modifying antifungal activity.
