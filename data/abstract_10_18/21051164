Malaria-associated mortality and morbidity have increased in recent decades, with the worldwide spread of chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistant parasites. Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) have been proposed as an alternative to conventional antimalarial drugs. ACTs are effective against multidrug-resistant infections, work quickly, are safe and well tolerated, and seem to decrease transmission by inactivating gametocytes. The affordable medicines facility-malaria (AMFm) - an initiative aiming at increasing the availability of affordable ACTs through public and private practice - is trying to accelerate the large-scale use of ACT worldwide. This began with an initial pilot phase in a selected group of African countries. However, the epidemiology of malaria, the economic context, and healthcare infrastructure of African countries differ considerably from those prevailing in Asia, where ACTs were first implemented in the 1990s. ACT implementation in Africa must therefore be accompanied by control and operational measures to maintain the efficacy of ACT and to protect patients against misuse. We discuss the expected benefits of the AMFm initiative in Africa and stress the importance of dealing with operational issues before implementation in the field, focusing particularly on drug resistance.
