OBJECTIVES: Resistance to attachment inhibitor BMS-626529, which inhibits the binding of HIV to CD4, involves mutations in the HIV-1 gp120 gene. There is a lack of information on the primary resistance of HIV-1 subtype B to attachment inhibitors, so we decided to investigate. METHODS: Sequences from 109 attachment-inhibitor-naive patients infected with HIV-1 subtype B were analysed for the presence of previously described in vivo resistance mutations associated with attachment inhibitor BMS-626529 and tropism determination. RESULTS: The M426L substitution associated with a reduced efficacy of the attachment inhibitor BMS-626529 was present at 7.3%. There was no difference in mutation distribution according to virus tropism (R5 or X4). CONCLUSIONS: The attachment inhibitor BMS-626529 is suitable for most patients infected with HIV-1 subtype B.
