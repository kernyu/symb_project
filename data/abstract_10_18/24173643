The safety of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei LC-01 was evaluated for its use as a potential probiotic. In our in vitro study, the antibiotic resistance and the ability to produce biogenic amine were determined. The results showed that the strain was sensitive to all tested antibiotics and did not produce biogenic amine except for tyramine. The oral toxicity of this strain was evaluated in Balb/C mice. One hundred mice were divided into 10 groups. Four groups were administered 0, 10(8), 10(9), or 10(10) CFU/mouse per day dissolved in saline solution respectively, for 28 days. Three groups were injected intraperitoneally with 10(9) CFU/mouse dissolved in saline solution, and were killed 2, 5, and 10 days after injection. The last 3 groups were injected with the vehicle as controls respectively. The results showed that oral administration of the strain had no adverse effects on mouse body weight and that there was no treatment-associated bacterial translocation. Intraperitoneal administration caused a significant translocation to liver, spleen and kidney. However, this translocation did not cause illness or death throughout the experiment. The results suggest that L. paracasei subsp. paracasei LC-01 is likely to be safe for human consumption.
