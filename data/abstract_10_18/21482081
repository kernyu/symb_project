Subinhibitory concentrations of vancomycin are known to induce a cell-wall stimulon in some Gram-positive pathogens, but this has never been studied in the genus Enterococcus. In this study, Enterococcus faecalis V583 strain was submitted to a subinhibitory concentration of vancomycin. DNA microarray technology was used to analyse the transcriptomic changes induced by this antibiotic. EF2292, annotated as a hypothetical protein in the E. faecalis V583 genome, was highly induced in response to vancomycin exposure, to similar levels as the vanB operon genes. We investigated further and provide evidence for co-transcription of ef2292 with vanY(B)WH(B)BX(B) genes. It was also demonstrated that expression of ef2292 is under the control of vanR(B)S(B) and it is proposed to name it vanV. This gene was found not to be required for vancomycin resistance under the conditions tested, thus coding for another accessory protein in the vanB operon. vanV was detected in some, but not all, E. faecalis carrying the vanB operon, suggesting that this operon can have different composition amongst E. faecalis isolates.
