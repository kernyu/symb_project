Resistance to carbapenems in enterobacteria is mediated by the production of several types of carbapenemases or by the decreased permeability of the outer membrane, combined with the expression of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) or AmpC-like cephalosporinases. The objective of this study was to characterize carbapenem-nonsusceptible (C-NS) isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae in the University Hospital in Plzen (Czech Republic) and compare them with carbapenem-susceptible (C-S) K. pneumoniae isolates from the same patients. Six C-NS K pneumoniae isolates from different patients were collected between January 2007 and June 2008, and from three of these patients, C-S isolates were available for the study as well. The isolates were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing. beta-Lactamases were analyzed by isoelectric focusing, bioassay, and PCR and sequencing of bla genes. Major porin channels, OmpK35 and OmpK36, were studied by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot; porin genes were amplified and sequenced, and their expression was assessed by reverse transcriptase-PCR. The C-NS isolates belonged to three pulsotypes and to the clone ST11, produced the SHV-5 ESBL and/or DHA-1 AmpC-type cephalosporinase, did not express OmpK36, and had a reduced expression of OmpK35. The C-S isolates differed from their C-NS counterparts only by porin expression profiles.
