BACKGROUND: Mycobacterial ES-31 serine protease has been reported to be a drug target using protease and lipase inhibitors in axenic and macrophage cultures. Simple screening techniques are needed for rapid testing of anti-tubercular drugs. AIM: To demonstrate the usefulness of ELISA protocol based on antigenic reactivity of mycobacterial serine protease by indirect ELISA for detecting anti-tubercular activity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Indirect ELISA for assessment of antigenic reactivity of mycobacterial ES-31 serine protease was standardized using ES-31Ag and anti-DSS-goat-serum and assessed the inhibition of the antigenic reactivity by isoniazid, an anti-tubercular drug and serine protease inhibitor and orlistat, a lipase inhibitor. RESULTS: Optimal antigenic reactivity of mycobacterial ES-31 serine protease was observed at 5 microg/well of ES-31 antigen and at 1:25 dilution of anti-DSS-goat-serum. Isoniazid showed 42% inhibition of ES-31 serine protease at 0.4 microg/well, while orlistat showed inhibition of 60% at 0.5 microg/well. Inhibition of Mtb H,37Ra bacilli is further confirmed in axenic culture. 35% and 29% inhibition by isoniazid at 0.4 microg/well and orlistat at 0.5 microg/well were observed respectively on bacterial growth. CONCLUSION: Simple ELISA protocol based on assay of antigenic reactivity of mycobacterial ES-31 serine protease, a drug target, has been standardized for rapid screening of potential anti-tubercular drugs.
