BACKGROUND: Dolutegravir is recommended as part of combination ART (cART) for HIV-1-infected patients. Toxicities, drug interactions and costs related to cART still warrant the search for improved treatment options. Dolutegravir's high resistance barrier might make it suitable as antiretroviral maintenance monotherapy. The feasibility of this strategy is currently unknown. METHODS: This is a prospective case series on five consecutive HIV-1-infected patients on cART without previous virological failure who switched to dolutegravir monotherapy. All were HIV-RNA suppressed <50 copies/mL and had contraindications to current and alternative combinations of antiretroviral drugs. HIV-RNA was measured at baseline, week 4, week 8, week 12 and every 6 weeks thereafter. Patients would be switched back to their original cART upon confirmed HIV-RNA >50 copies/mL. RESULTS: The five patients had been HIV-RNA suppressed <50 copies/mL for >/=1.5 years prior to the initiation of dolutegravir monotherapy. All were on NNRTI-containing regimens at the switch. HIV-RNA remained <50 copies/mL at all timepoints in four patients. One patient, with end-stage renal disease and on calcium supplements, had a pre-cART HIV-RNA of 625 000 copies/mL with a CD4 nadir of 120 cells/mm(3) and had HIV-RNA of 8150 copies/mL at week 30. The dolutegravir Ctrough was 0.18 mg/L. This patient did not have acquired resistance or evidence of adherence problems and HIV-RNA was resuppressed after switching to his former cART. CONCLUSIONS: This case series indicates that dolutegravir monotherapy might be a valuable maintenance option in selected HIV-infected patients who are well suppressed on cART, if confirmed by future randomized clinical trials.
