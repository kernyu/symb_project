MALDI-TOF MS detection of carbapenemase-activity in Gram-negative bacteria was compared against the Carba-NP assay. MALDI-TOF MS detected activity from 99% of the strains, from all types of carbapenemase (200/202), while Carba-NP assays detected activity from 85% (45/53) of the tested isolates and could not consistently identify OXA- or GES carbapenemase activity.
