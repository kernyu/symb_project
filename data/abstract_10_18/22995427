Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the common pathogenic causes of serious infections in burn patients throughout the world. Type III secretion toxins are thought to promote the dissemination of P. aeruginosa from the site of infection, the bacterial evasion of the host immune response and inhibition of DNA synthesis leading to host cell death. A total of 96 isolates of P. aeruginosa were collected from wound infections of burn patients, from April to July 2010. Antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates were determined by disk agar diffusion method. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method was used for targeting the genes encoding the type III secretion toxins. The quantitative determination of biofilm-forming capacity was determined by a colorimetric microtiter plate assay. All the isolates were resistant to cefixime and ceftriaxone. More than 90% of the isolates were resistant to amikacin, carbenicillin, cefepime, cefotaxime, cefpodoxime, gatifloxacin, gentamicin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ticarcillin and tobramycin. All the isolates carried the exoT gene, 95% carried exoY, 64.5% carried exoU and 29% carried the exoS gene. Most of the isolates (58%) carried both exoY and exoU genes while 24% showed the concomitant presence of exoS and exoY and 1% carried both exoS and exoU. Coexistence of exoS, exoY and exoU was seen in 4% of the isolates. Biofilm formation was seen in more than 96% of the isolates among which 47% were strong biofilm producers, 26% were moderate and 22.9% were weak biofilm formers. In conclusion, the findings of this study show that the genes, particularly the exoU gene, encoding the type III secretion toxins, are commonly disseminated among the P. aeruginosa strains isolated from burn patients.
