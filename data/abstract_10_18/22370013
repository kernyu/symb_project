We report the identification of New Delhi metallo-betalactamase 1 (NDM-1)-producing Klebsiella pnemoniae in Ireland. The organism was resistant to multiple antibiotic classes, including carbapenems, and PCR and sequencing confirmed the presence of the blaNDM-1 gene, carried on a 98 kb plasmid. The organism was isolated from an infant, who was born in India and moved to Ireland at the age of four months. This is the first reported isolation of an NDM-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae strain in Ireland.
