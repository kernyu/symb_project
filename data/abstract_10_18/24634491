Cell-mediated immunity plays a crucial role in the development of host resistance to asexual blood-stage malaria infection. However, little is known of the regulatory factors involved in this process. In this study, we investigated the impact of MAPK phosphotase 5 (MKP5) on protective immunity against a lethal Plasmodium yoelii 17XL blood-stage infection using MKP5 knockout C57BL/6 mice. Compared with wild-type control mice, MKP5 knockout mice developed significantly lower parasite burdens with prolonged survival times. We found that this phenomenon correlated with a rapid and strong IFN-gamma-dependent cellular immune response during the acute phase of infection. Inactivation of IFN-gamma by the administration of a neutralizing Ab significantly reduced the protective effects in MKP5 knockout mice. By analyzing IFN-gamma production in innate and adaptive lymphocyte subsets, we observed that MKP5 deficiency specifically enhanced the IFN-gamma response mediated by CD4+ T cells, which was attributable to the increased stimulatory capacity of splenic CD11c+ dendritic cells. Furthermore, following vaccination with whole blood-stage soluble plasmodial Ag, MKP5 knockout mice acquired strongly enhanced Ag-specific immune responses and a higher level of protection against subsequent P. yoelii 17XL challenge. Finally, we found the enhanced response mediated by MKP5 deficiency resulted in a lethal consequence in mice when infected with nonlethal P. yoelii 17XNL. Thus, our data indicate that MKP5 is a potential regulator of immune resistance against Plasmodium infection in mice, and that an understanding of the role of MKP5 in manipulating anti-malaria immunity may provide valuable information on the development of better control strategies for human malaria.
