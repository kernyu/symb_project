Eleven published studies of the etiology of travellers' diarrhea (TD) were reviewed define the etiology of TD and to exam newly developed technology such as Real-Time multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify multiple pathogens in one assay to define the cause of TD. Using PCR methods bacterial pathogens were found in 72% of patients acquiring diarrhea in Latin America and in 80% in travellers with illness acquired in Southeast Asia). In these studies, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli as the predominant pathogen (42% in Latin America and 28% in Southeast Asia). Ciprofloxacin-resistant Campylobacter was commonly associated with TD in Southeast Asia. Multiplex PCR has improved the detection of enteropathogens and allowed better assessment returning travellers hospitalized with TD and those with persistent diarrhea.
