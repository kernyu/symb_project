Myroides sp., previously known as Flavobacterium odoratum, is a relatively unknown organism with unclear human pathogenicity. While Myroides sp. has been implicated in human infections, many reports have described the organism as a relatively avirulent opportunistic pathogen. We present an unusual case of rapidly fatal necrotizing fasciitis and septic shock due to Myroides odoratus. Our case demonstrates the pathogenicity of Myroides, and highlights potential risk factors for infection including underlying liver disease and open wounds. The recognition of Myroides is of particular importance given its resistance to multiple antibiotics. We review the literature on Myroides sp. skin and soft tissue infections, including necrotizing forms, and discuss the clinical presentation and management of this potentially emerging pathogen.
