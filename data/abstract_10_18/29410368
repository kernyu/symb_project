Tigecycline and comparators were tested by reference broth microdilution method against 33,348 non-duplicate bacterial isolates collected prospectively in 2016 from medical centers in Asia-Pacific (3,443 isolates), Europe (13,530 isolates), Latin America (3,327 isolates), and United States (13,048 isolates). Among 7,098 Staphylococcus aureus isolates tested, >99.9% were inhibited by </=0.5 mg/L of tigecycline (MIC50/90, 0.06/0.12 mg/L), including >99.9% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and 100.0% of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. Tigecycline was slightly more active against E. faecium (MIC50/90, 0.03/0.06 mg/L) when compared to E. faecalis (MIC50/90, 0.06/0.12 mg/L), and its activity was not adversely affected by vancomycin resistance when tested against these organisms. Tigecycline potency was comparable for Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC50/90, 0.03/0.06 mg/L), viridans group streptococci (MIC50/90, 0.03/0.06 mg/L), and beta-haemolytic streptococci (MIC50/90, 0.06/0.06 mg/L) regardless of species and susceptibility to penicillin. Tigecycline was active against Enterobacteriaceae (MIC50/90, 0.25/1 mg/L; 97.8% inhibited at </=2 mg/L) but was slightly less active against Enterobacteriaceae isolates expressing resistant phenotypes: carbapenem-resistant (CRE; MIC50/90, 0.5/2 mg/L; 98.0% susceptible), multidrug-resistant (MDR; MIC50/90, 0.5/2 mg/L; 93.1% susceptible), and extensively drug-resistant (XDR; MIC50/90, 0.5/4 mg/L; 87.8% susceptible). Tigecycline (MIC50/90, 2/4 mg/L) inhibited 74.4% of 888 A. baumannii isolates at </=2 mg/L and demonstrated good in vitro activity against S. maltophilia (MIC50/90, 1/2 mg/L; 90.6% inhibited at </=2 mg/L) Tigecycline was active against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC50/90, 0.12/0.25 mg/L) regardless of beta-lactamase status. Tigecycline represents an important treatment option for resistant Gram-negative and Gram-positive infections.
