AIM: To investigate the association between the single nucleotide polymorphisms(SNP) in -88 and -123 loci of myxovirus resistance 1(MxA) gene promoter region and the susceptibility to heptaitis C virus(HCV) in Han Chinese, and evaluate the relationship between all of the genotypes and the treatment response to IFN-alpha. METHODS: Genotypes of -88(G/T) and -123(C/A) loci of the MxA promoter were examined by the polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism(PCR-RFLP) in 46 patients with chronic hepatitis C(CHC group) and 50 healthy controls(HC group). The indexes for evaluating the curative effect were the biochemical and virological response rates(RVR/EVR/ETVR/SVR). RESULTS: There was no statistical significance in frequency distribution difference of the genotypes and alleles of -88/-123 loci between CHC and CH groups(P>0.05): the T-alleles of MxA-88 locus and the A-alleles of MxA-123 locus may be not associated with the susceptibility to HCV(OR95%CI: 0.60-1.96, 0.35-1.14, respectively). The level of ALT increased and was positively correlated with HCV-RNA load(r=0.931). No significant difference was discovered in terms of the HCV viral load and the ALT levels among different genotypes of -88 or -123 loci(P>0.05). IFN-alpha treatment response rates were also not significantly different among -88G/T, -123C/A and MxA-88/-123(P>0.05). CONCLUSION: There is no distinct correlation between the SNP of MxA-88G/T and MxA-123C/A loci and HCV susceptibility, but the MxA-88T/-123A gene variants may indirectly increase the risk for HCV infection, and the MxA-88T gene mutation may be related to IFN-alpha antiviral efficacy and the outcomes of HCV infection.
