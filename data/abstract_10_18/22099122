To increase understanding of drug-resistant Vibrio cholerae, we studied selected molecular mechanisms of antimicrobial drug resistance in the 2010 Haiti V. cholerae outbreak strain. Most resistance resulted from acquired genes located on an integrating conjugative element showing high homology to an integrating conjugative element identified in a V. cholerae isolate from India.
