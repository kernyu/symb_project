Resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics can be mediated by metallo-beta-lactamase enzymes (MBLs). An MBL inhibitor could restore the effectiveness of beta-lactams. We report on the evaluation of approved thiol-containing drugs as inhibitors of NDM-1, VIM-1, and IMP-7. Drugs were assessed by a novel assay using a purchasable fluorescent substrate and thermal shift. Best compounds were tested in antimicrobial susceptibility assay. Using these orthogonal screening methods, we identified drugs that restored the activity of imipenem.
