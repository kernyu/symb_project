INTRODUCTION: Despite the Treatment pulmonary TB patients, defaulting from treatment may remain the major challenge to control TB. In addition, it increases the risk of drug resistance, relapse, and death and may prolong infectiousness. Our objective was to identify determinants of treatment defaulting among TB patients in Khartoum State, Sudan. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study where the patients defaulting from treatment were considered as 'cases' and those completing treatment as 'controls'. Between May 2010 to May 2011. RESULTS: There were 2727 TB patients who attended TB treatment clinics during study period. Out of these 2399 patients (86%) had continued their treatment while 328 patients (14%) had interrupted it. 105 cases were traced and interviewed. In addition 210 patients who had continued their treatment were included (controls). In the multivariate analysis the variables that remained in the model were: residential locality (rural area) (OR 2.58; 95% CI 1.4 -4.67), patients moving or changing address (OR 5.47; 95% CI 2,90- 10-35), absence of family support (OR 2.14; 95% CI 1.12 - 4.11), and occupation (blue collar work) (OR 2.38; 95% CI 1.39 -4.10). CONCLUSION: The results of this study conclude some socio-demographic factors influence defaulting of TB treatment. We believe that the findings are applicable to current situation of TB management and control in Sudan and other developing countries.
