Enteroviruses form an important genus within the large family of Picornaviridae. They are small, non-enveloped (+)RNA viruses, many of which are important pathogens in human and veterinary science. Despite their huge medical and socio-economical impact, there is still no approved antiviral therapy at hand for the treatment of these infections. Three capsid-targeting molecules (pleconaril, BTA-798 and V-073) are in clinical development. Pleconaril and BTA-798 are in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of enterovirus-induced sepsis syndrome and rhinovirus-induced aggravation of pre-existing asthma or COPD respectively. V-073 is in preclinical development for the treatment of poliovirus infections in the context of the worldwide polio eradication program. The capsid binding molecules have shown good in vitro potency against a number of enterovirus species, but lack activity against others. Another potential drawback of capsid inhibitors in the clinical setting could be the rapid emergence of drug resistance. It will therefore be important to develop inhibitors that affect other stages in the viral replication cycle. Several viral proteins, such as the viral 3C protease, the putative 2C helicase and the 3D RNA-dependent RNA polymerase may be/are excellent targets for inhibition of viral replication. Also host cell factors that are crucial in viral replication may be considered as potential targets for an antiviral approach. Unraveling these complex virus-host interactions will also provide better insights into the replication of enteroviruses. This review aims to summarize and discuss known inhibitors and potential viral and cellular targets for antiviral therapy against enteroviruses.
