The resistance to current antibiotics results in the emergence of health-threatening bacteria. Silver nanoparticles are known to exhibit broad-spectrum antibacterial activities without the development of resistance. Herein, we developed a green synthetic method for the preparation of silver nanoparticles with sialyllactose instead of toxic chemicals as a reducing agent, which would improve its therapeutic applicability and increase its biocompatibility. Oven incubation, autoclaving and microwave irradiation methods were applied to prepare the silver nanoparticles. High resolution-transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy images revealed mostly spherical and amorphous silver nanoparticles with an average diameter of 23.64 nm. Fourier Transform-infrared spectra suggest that the N-H amide of sialyllactose might be involved in the binding of silver nanoparticles. Based on thermogravimetric analyses, 2,3-sialyllactose-reduced silver nanoparticles are composed of 54.3 wt% organic components and 45.7 wt% metallic silver. Enhanced antibacterial activities of silver nanoparticles (approximately 8-fold) were observed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium (minimum inhibitory concentration 16 microg/mL). Next, we employed the use of carbohydrate stabilizers to increase the stability of silver nanoparticles during a freeze-drying process. It was found that sucrose and trehalose were the most effective stabilizers. In addition, silver nanoparticles possessed excellent salt stability as well as on-the-shelf stability in the presence of these stabilizers. Derivatives of sialic acid are known to be anti-influenza agents; therefore, the newly prepared silver nanoparticles may serve as useful antibacterial and antiviral agents to cope with both pathogenic bacteria and viruses in the near future.
