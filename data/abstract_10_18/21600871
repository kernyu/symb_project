Small multidrug resistance (SMR) protein family member, SugE, is an integral inner membrane protein that confers host resistance to antiseptic quaternary cation compounds (QCC). SugE studies generally focus on its resistance to limited substrates in comparison to SMR protein EmrE. This study examines the conformational characteristics of SugE protein in two detergents, sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and dodecyl maltoside (DDM), commonly used to study SMR proteins. The influence of cetylpyridinium (CTP) and cetrimide (CET) using SugE aromatic residues (4W, 2Y, 1F) as intrinsic spectroscopic probes was also determined. Organically extracted detergent solubilized Escherichia coli SugE protein was examined by SDS-Tricine PAGE and various spectroscopic techniques. SDS-Tricine PAGE analysis of SugE in either detergent demonstrates the protein predominates as a monomer but also dimerizes in SDS. Far-UV region circular dichroism (CD) analysis determined that the overall alpha-helix content SugE in SDS and DDM was almost identical and unaltered by QCC. Near-UV region CD, fluorescence, and second-derivative ultraviolet absorption (SDUV) indicated that only DDM-SugE promoted hydrophobic environments for its Trp and Tyr residues that were perturbed by QCC addition. This study identified that only the tertiary structure of SugE protein in DDM is altered by QCC.
