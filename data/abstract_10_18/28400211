OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to design a rapid and sensitive real-time PCR (rt-PCR) method for colistin resistance mcr-1 gene detection in human faecal samples. METHODS: Stools (n=88) from 36 volunteers were analysed. To isolate mcr-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae, samples were enriched overnight in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth containing 2mg/L colistin and were then plated on selective agar plates with 4mg/L colistin. A SYBR((R)) Green-based rt-PCR targeting mcr-1 was then designed. For method validation and to establish the limit of detection (LOD), total DNA was extracted from mcr-1-negative and mcr-1-positive Escherichia coli. rt-PCR was also performed with DNA extracted from 88 native stools and after enriching them in LB broth containing colistin. RESULTS: Based on the culture approach, three unique volunteers resulted colonised with mcr-1-harboring E. coli strains. For culture isolates, rt-PCR exhibited a LOD of 10 genomic copies/reaction, with both sensitivity and specificity of 100%. Nevertheless, when testing native stools, only two of the three mcr-1-positive specimens were detected. However, after enrichment in LB broth containing colistin, the rt-PCR was strongly positive for all culture-positive samples. The average cycle threshold was 22, granting rapid and confident detection of positive specimens within 30 cycles. No false positives were observed for the remaining 85 culture-negative specimens. CONCLUSIONS: A rapid rt-PCR for detection of mcr-1 from stool specimens was developed. The detection rate was increased by testing selective broth enrichments. This approach also has the advantage of concomitant isolation of mcr-1-harboring strains for further antimicrobial susceptibility and genetic testing.
