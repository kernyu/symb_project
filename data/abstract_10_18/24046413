This study investigated the occurrence of avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) in a finishing turkey commercial farm, carrying out longitudinal surveys involving 3 consecutive flocks. The diversity and the distribution of the E. coli strains detected during colisepticemia outbreaks were examined. The strains were isolated, serogrouped, assessed for the presence of virulence-associated genes, typed by random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD), and antimicrobial resistance analysis was then carried out. Escherichia coli O78 and O2 were predominantly found. Moreover, based on the somatic antigens used in the study, strains were recovered that were nontypeable. On one occasion, an E. coli O111 strain was found in turkeys. The E. coli isolates differed in terms of antibiotic resistance and RAPD profile. All strains possessed the virulence genes that enabled them to be considered APEC. Strains not only differed between flocks, but also within the same flock. These findings point out the importance of addressing colibacillosis therapy on the basis of a sensitivity test.
