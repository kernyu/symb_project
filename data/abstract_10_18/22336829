BACKGROUND: The current recommended antiretroviral treatment is a highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Although HAART has been associated with improved clinical response to treatment, issues of adherence and viral resistance are major challenges limiting its success. There is a need for an effective and safe first-line regimen, to cope with the ever-increasing incidence of non-adherence and primary resistance. A more recent first-line treatment regimen consists of Tenofovir (TDF, 300 mg) + Emtricitabine (FTC, 200 mg) + Efavirenz (EFV, 600 mg). OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects and safety of TDF + FTC + EFV as first-line treatment for patients with HIV. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, GATEWAY, LILACS, PubMed, AEGIS, and the WHO prospective clinical trials registry in November 2011. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of TDF + FTC + EFV compared with other HAART regimens. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data from the included study. MAIN RESULTS: Only one study involving 517 antiretroviral-naive HIV infected adults was included in this review. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either a regimen of TDF (300 mg), FTC (200mg), and EFV (600mg ) once daily; or a regimen of fixed-dose zidovudine (AZT) (300 mg) and lamivudine (3TC) (150 mg) twice daily plus EFV (600mg) once daily. Significantly more patients in the TDF-FTC group reached and maintained HIV RNA levels of less than 50 copies per milliliter compared to the AZT- 3TC group (RR 1.13; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.25). Also, more participants in the TDF-FTC group had greater increase from baseline CD4 cell counts compared to the AZT-3TC group (190 vs. 158 cells per mm(3)). More patients in the AZT-3TC group than in the TDF-FTC group had adverse events resulting in discontinuation of the study drugs (9% vs. 4%, respectively; P = 0.02). There was no statistically significant difference in all cause mortality (RR 0.50; 95% CI 0.05 to 5.46). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Only one trial has shown beneficial effects and safety of TDF+ FTC + EFV as first-line treatment for patients with HIV. The effects and safety of TDF + FTC + EFV as first-line treatment for patients with HIV cannot be assessed on the basis of only one trial. Further studies evaluating the effects and safety of TDF + FTC + EFV as first-line treatment for patients with HIV are needed.
