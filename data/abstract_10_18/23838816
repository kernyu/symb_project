beta-Lactamases inactivate beta-lactam antibiotics by hydrolysis of their endocyclic beta-lactam bond and are a major cause of antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria. The zinc dependent metallo-beta-lactamase enzymes are of particular concern since they are located on highly transmissible plasmids and have a broad spectrum of activity against almost all beta-lactam antibiotics. We present here essentially complete (>96%) backbone and sidechain sequence-specific NMR resonance assignments for the Bacillus cereus subclass B1 metallo-beta-lactamase, BcII, and for its complex with R-thiomandelic acid, a broad spectrum inhibitor of metallo-beta-lactamases. These assignments have been used as the basis for determination of the solution structures of the enzyme and its inhibitor complex and can also be used in a rapid screen for other metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitors.
