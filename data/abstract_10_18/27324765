Praziquantel (PZQ) is the only drug available for the treatment of schistosomiasis, and since its large-scale use might be associated with the onset of resistance, new antischistosomal drugs should be developed. A series of 26 synthetic tetraazamacrocyclic derivatives and their metal complexes were synthesized, characterized, and screened for antischistosomal activity by application of a phased screening program. The compounds were first screened against newly transformed schistosomula (NTS) of harvested Schistosoma mansoni cercariae, then against adult worms, and finally, in vivo using the mouse model of S. mansoni infection. At a concentration of 33 muM, incubation with a total of 12 compounds resulted in the mortality of NTS at the 62% to 100% level. Five of these showing 100% inhibition of viability of NTS at 10 muM were selected for further screening for determination of the 50 inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) against both NTS and adult worms. Against NTS, all 5 compounds showed IC50s comparable to the IC50 of the standard drug, PZQ (0.87 to 9.65 muM for the 5 compounds versus 2.20 muM for PZQ). Three of these, which are the bisquinoline derivative of cyclen and its Fe(2+) and Mn(2+) complexes, showed micromolar IC50s (1.62 muM, 1.34 muM, and 4.12 muM, respectively, versus 0.10 muM for PZQ) against adult worms. In vivo, the worm burden reductions were 12.3%, 88.4%, and 74.5%, respectively, at a single oral dose of 400 mg/kg of body weight. The Fe(2+) complex exhibited activity in vivo comparable to that of PZQ, pointing to the discovery of a novel drug lead for schistosomiasis.
