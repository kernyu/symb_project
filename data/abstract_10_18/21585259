Species of Acinetobacter other than Acinetobacter baumannii are involved in nosocomial infections. Acinetobacter lwoffii, Acinetobacter genomospecies 3 and Acinetobacter genomospecies 13TU are found in community- and nosocomial-acquired infections as well as in neonatal intensive care units. The non-baumannii Acinetobacter are normally highly susceptible to ciprofloxacin, ampicillin/sulbactam, gentamicin and tigecycline. Carbepenems show good activity although resistant isolates have been reported. Resistance to beta-lactams other than carbapenems is associated with overexpression of chromosomal cephalosporinases and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase acquisition, whereas resistance to carbapenems involves acquisition of carbapenemases. Quinolone resistance is related to gyrA and/or parC mutations but overexpresion of efflux proteins also plays an important role. With the development of novel and more accurate typing methodologies, an increase in infections caused by non-baumannii Acinetobacter might be observed in the future.
