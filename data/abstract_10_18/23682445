In Japan azithromycin (AZM) has been used to treat enteric fever caused by bacteria with resistance to fluoroquinolones; however, the dose, length of treatment and effectiveness of AZM among Japanese patients with enteric fever is unclear. We studied 5 Japanese adults and 1 Japanese child with enteric fever (4 had typhoid fever and 2 had paratyphoid fever) who were treated with oral AZM. The treatment regimens were: 1,000 mg as a single or in 2 divided doses on the 1st day, followed by 500 mg as a single dose daily for 5-6 additional days, or 500 mg as a single dose daily for 10 days. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for AZM against 5 causative organisms were investigated with an E-test. Good clinical results were observed in the 5 adult patients but treatment failure was seen in the 1 child patient with typhoid fever; no adverse reactions were found. MICs of AZM were 4 microg/ml against S. Typhi in 2 patients, 8 microg/ml against S. Typhi in 2 patients, and 32 microg/ml against S. Paratyphi A in 1 patient. Our findings indicate AZM may be a reasonable choice for treatment of Japanese adult patients with enteric fever.
