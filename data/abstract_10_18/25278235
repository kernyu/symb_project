Histidinol dehydrogenase (HDH) has been established as a virulence factor for the human pathogen bacterium Brucella suis. Targeting such a virulence factor is a relevant anti-infectious approach as it could decrease the frequency of antibiotic resistance appearance. In this paper, we describe the synthesis of a family of oxo- and thioxo-imidazo[1,5-c]pyrimidines, potential enzyme inhibitors. Beyond their anti-HDH activity, the synthesis approach of these molecules, never described before, is highly original and these oxo- and thioxo- derivatives can improve dramatically the efficiency of the histidine protection pathway for the synthesis of histidine analogues.
