BACKGROUND: Refractory carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) isolates increase mortality and morbidity rates among patients with underlying disorders, especially in patients with burns. The aim of the current study was to understand the resistant determinants of CRAB isolates and their clonal relatedness collected from referral Burn center. METHODS: CRAB isolates were initially characterized and then antimicrobial susceptibility testing was assessed by E-test. Resistance determinants were investigated by PCR. Repetitive extragenic palindromic elements-PCR (REP-PCR) was used for clonality relatedness among isolates. RESULTS: Thirty CRAB isolates were collected during the study. Colistin was the most effective antibiotic, but, all of the isolates were resistant to carbapenems. intI1 was detected in two isolates and MBLs and gene cassettes were not detected. ISAba1, blaOXA-51, blaOXA-23 and ISAba1/blaOXA23-like were detected in all, while blaOXA-24-like were present in 73% and blaOXA-58&OXA-143 were not present in isolates. REP-PCR demonstrated three clusters, with the dominant B cluster, which contained 16 subgroups. CONCLUSION: CRAB harboring ISAba1/blaOXA-23-like family is widely disseminated in the studied Burn ward setting and the emergence of infection control measures should be regarded to limit refractory CRABs.
