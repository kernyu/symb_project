Recurrent oral candidosis is a common problem in immunocompromised patients, and it is frequently triggered by resistance induced by antifungal treatment. Knowledge of the mechanisms by which the yeast persists in the host could allow the management of this type of infection. This study used electrophoretic karyotyping and restriction fragment length polymorphism based on the use of 27A probe to study 12 pairs of Candida albicans isolates from patients with recurrent candidosis to distinguish new infections from relapses caused by the same strain responsible for the first episode. Subsequently, RT-PCR was used to evaluate expression of CDR1, CDR2 and MDR1 genes, which are involved in C. albicans azole resistance, in the three pairs that consisted of variants of the same strain. Restriction polymorphism resulted in better discrimination than with karyotyping in defining differences between strains. In one case, RT-PCR allowed us to identify deregulation of efflux pump genes as the possible underlying mechanism in recurrent candidosis. The techniques employed resulted effective for the characterization of recurrent oral candidosis. Broader analysis could help to control better these infections and choose adequate therapy.
