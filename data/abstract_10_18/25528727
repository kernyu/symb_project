In this study, we explored the prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) ST398 in retail foods and then investigated for their virulence and antimicrobial resistance genetic background. Fourteen out of 5103 (0.27%) samples were positive for methicillin susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) ST398. Resistance was most frequently observed to penicillin (PEN) (100%), followed by trimethoprim (TMP), erythromycin (ERY) and ampicillin (AMP) (each 86.7%), clindamycin (CLD, 80.0%), and tetracycline (TET, 26.7%). All ST398 isolates were susceptible to amikacin, chloramphenicol, cefoxitin, gentamicin, oxacillin, and vancomycin. Two predominant resistance patterns including TMP-ERY-CLD-PEN-AMP (60.0%) and TMP-ERY-TET-CLD-PEN-AMP (20.0%) were identified. Isolates harbored blaZ (86.7%) gene, followed by tet(L) and linA/linA' (each 46.7%), ermB and msrA (each 33.3%), aph(3')-IIIa and dfrK (each 26.7%), tet(K) (20.0%), ant(4')-Ia, ermA and emrC (each 13.3%) and cat::pC221 (6.7%). No isolate carried mecA, tet(M), tet(O), fexA, aac(6')/aph(2''), cfr, ermT, msrB, cat::pC194, cat::pC223, catpIp-501, dfrD, dfrG and dfrS1 genes. For virulence genes, hld (73.3%), seb and sed (each 66.7%), hla (60.0%), lukPV (33.3%), sej (26.7%), lukED and seg (each 3.3%) were detected. None of isolates contained sea, sec, see, seh, sei, tst, eta, etb, sek-ser, seu, lukM, hlg, and hlgv genes. Four spa types were found, including t571 (6/15), t034 (4/15), t2876 (3/15) and t1250 (2/15). All strains were non-typeable for agr locus. Our findings indicated that MSSA ST398 isolates had a low prevalence rate in retail foods, and these isolates harbored multiple virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes, and exhibited multiple antimicrobial resistance. Further studies are required to elucidate the possible role of MSSA ST398 as a source of human infection.
