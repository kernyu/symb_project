BACKGROUND: A novel reassortant avian-origin influenza A (H7N9) virus was isolated from respiratory specimens obtained from three patients and was identified as H7N9 in China. Antiviral agents are required to treat patients with avian influenza H7N9 virus infection. METHODS: In this study, we assessed the antiviral potential of oseltamivir, peramivir, favipiravir (T-705), amantadine and rimantadine against novel reassortant avian-origin influenza H7N9 virus in vitro. RESULTS: All three avian influenza H7N9 virus strains were sensitive to oseltamivir, peramivir and favipiravir (T-705), but resistant to amantadine and rimantadine. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show a pattern of antiviral sensitivity for this novel H7N9 strain of influenza that suggests the compounds oseltamivir, peramivir and favipiravir should be useful for therapy.
