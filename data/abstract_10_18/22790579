A 59-year old woman had been suffering from myalgia, eruption and dyspnea on effort for a month. She was referred to our hospital because her symptoms were not improved by antibiotic therapy at a clinic. At first presentation she showed cutaneous manifestations including heliotrope eyelids and mechanic's hands, slightly elevated serum creatine kinase (CK), elevated serum C-reactive protein level, and interstitial pneumonia (IP), which led to a diagnosis as dermatomyositis. After admission to our hospital, her hypoxia due to IP progressed despite disappeared myalgia and normalized serum CK level. Intravenous steroid pulse therapy followed by oral cyclosporine and intravenous cyclophosphamide pulse therapy was not effective for the IP for more than a month. Gastroscopy revealed superficial depressed (0-IIc) type early gastric cancer. However, it was out of indication for endoscopic mucosal resection because of the histopathologic type (signet ring cell carcinoma) and possible submucosal invasion. In addition to those immunosuppressive therapies, proximal gastrectomy with total intravenous anesthesia was performed. One month after the operation, improvement of IP as well as cutaneous manifestations was confirmed by respiratory function test, pulmonary computed tomography, and discontinuance of oxygen inhalation. We conclude that this was a case of clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis with rapidly progressive IP and gastric cancer, which was ameliorated by a combination of medication (steroid, cyclosporine, and cyclophosphamide) and surgery (gastrectomy for early gastric cancer).
