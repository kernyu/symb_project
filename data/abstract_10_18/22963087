Influenza therapy with a single targeted compound is often limited in efficacy due to the rapidly developed drug resistance. Moreover, the uncontrolled virus-induced cytokines could cause the high mortality of human infected by H5N1 avian influenza virus. In this study, we explored the novel dual-targeted bifunctional anti-influenza drugs formed by conjugation with anti-inflammatory agents. In particular, the caffeic acid (CA)-bearing zanamivir (ZA) conjugates ZA-7-CA (1) and ZA-7-CA-amide (7) showed simultaneous inhibition of influenza virus neuraminidase and suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These ZA conjugates provided remarkable protection of cells and mice against influenza infections. Intranasal administration of low dosage (<1.2 mumol/kg/day) of ZA conjugates exhibited much greater effect than the combination therapy with ZA and the anti-inflammatory agents in protection of the lethally infected mice by H1N1 or H5N1 influenza viruses.
