Akara Ogbomoso was examined toward the establishment of hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP). The akara was produced in residential buildings with the attendant consequence of contamination. There was ample growth of aerobes, coliforms, staphylococci, Shigella and yeast/mold from the samples, water and cowpea pastes. Microbial contaminations occur through the processing, which can be corrected through education by adopting good hygienic and manufacturing practices. The critical control points were identified as frying, storage and refrying. It may be heated in the microwave for 10 s before consumption. Akara, prepared in the laboratory through the implementation of HACCP was not contaminated. Several bacterial isolates, namely; Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus sp. and Shigella sp., showed multiple resistance to antibiotics ranging from two to nine. Seven strains were not resistant to the antibiotics, while five were resistant to one type of antibiotic.
