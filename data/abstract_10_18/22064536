We determined the prevalence of gyrA mutations conferring fluoroquinolone resistance in 97 Helicobacter pylori isolates collected in France from 2007 to 2010. Ninety-four harbored one or two mutations already found in the quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR) of gyrA (for T87I, n = 23; for N87K, n = 32; for D91N, n = 30; for D91G, n = 7; for D91Y, n = 6), 2 harbored a mutation never previously described (D91H and A88P), and one strain was resistant (ciprofloxacin MIC of 8 mg/liter) without a detected mutation conferring this resistance in gyrA or gyrB genes.
