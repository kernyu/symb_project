Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) is an emerging pathogen with a devastating impact on organ transplant recipients (OTRs). Data describing urinary tract infections (UTIs) due to CRKP, compared to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing and susceptible K. pneumoniae, are lacking. We conducted a retrospective cohort study comparing OTRs with a first episode of UTI due to CRKP, ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, or susceptible K. pneumoniae. We identified 108 individuals; 22 (20%) had UTIs due to CRKP, 22 (20%) due to ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, and 64 (60%) due to susceptible K. pneumoniae. Compared to susceptible K. pneumoniae (27%), patients with UTIs due to CRKP or ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae were more likely to have a >/= 24-hour stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) before or after development of the UTI (64% and 77%, respectively; P < 0.001). Among 105/108 hospitalized patients (97%), the median lengths of stay prior to UTI with CRKP or ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae (7 and 8 days, respectively) were significantly longer than that for susceptible K. pneumoniae (1 day; P < 0.001). Clinical failure was observed for 8 patients (36%) with CRKP, 4 (18%) with ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, and 9 (14%) with susceptible K. pneumoniae (P = 0.073). Microbiological failure was seen for 10 patients (45%) with CRKP, compared with 2 (9%) with ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae and 2 (3%) with susceptible K. pneumoniae (P < 0.001). In multivariable logistic regression analyses, CRKP was associated with greater odds of microbiological failure (versus ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae: odds ratio [OR], 9.36, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.94 to 72.1; versus susceptible K. pneumoniae: OR, 31.4, 95% CI, 5.91 to 264). In conclusion, CRKP is associated with ICU admission, long length of stay, and microbiological failure among OTRs with UTIs. Greater numbers are needed to determine risk factors for infection and differences in meaningful endpoints associated with carbapenem resistance.
