We identified GRL-1388 and -1398, potent nonpeptidic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitors (PIs) containing a bicyclic P2 functional moiety, tetrahydropyrano-tetrahydrofuran (Tp-THF). GRL-1388 was as potent as darunavir (DRV) against various drug-resistant HIV-1 laboratory strains with 50% effective concentration (EC(50)s) of 2.6 to 32.6 nM. GRL-1398 was significantly more potent against such variants than DRV with EC(50)s of 0.1 to 5.7 nM. GRL-1388 and -1398 were also potent against multiple-PI-resistant clinical HIV-1 variants ((CL)HIV-1(MDR)) with EC(50)s ranging from 2.7 to 21.3 nM and from 0.3 to 4.8 nM, respectively. A highly DRV-resistant HIV-1 variant selected in vitro remained susceptible to GRL-1398 with the EC(50) of 21.9 nM, while the EC(50) of DRV was 214.1 nM. When HIV-1(NL4-3) was selected with GRL-1398, four amino acid substitutions--leucine to phenylalanine at a position 10 (L10F), A28S, L33F, and M46I--emerged, ultimately enabling the virus to replicate in the presence of >1.0 muM the compound beyond 57 weeks of selection. When a mixture of 10 different (CL)HIV-1(MDR) strains was selected, the emergence of resistant variants was more substantially delayed with GRL-1398 than with GRL-1388 and DRV. Modeling analyses revealed that GRL-1398 had greater overall hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions than GRL-1388 and DRV and that GRL-1388 and -1398 had hydrogen bonding interactions with the main chain of the active-site amino acids (Asp29 and Asp30) of protease. The present findings warrant that GRL-1398 be further developed as a potential drug for treating individuals with HIV-1 infection.
