Control of fasciolosis is threatened by the development of anthelmintic resistance. Enhanced triclabendazole (TCBZ) efflux by ABC transporters such as P-glycoprotein (Pgp) has been implicated in this process. A putative full length cDNA coding for a Pgp expressed in adult Fasciola hepatica has been constructed and used to design a primer set capable of amplifying a region encoding part of the second nucleotide binding domain of Pgp when genomic DNA was used as a template. Application of this primer set to genomic DNA from TCBZ-resistant and -susceptible field populations has shown a significant difference in the alleles present. Analysis of an allele occurring at a three-fold higher frequency in the "resistant" population revealed that it was characterised by a serine to arginine substitution at residue 1144. Homology modelling studies have been used to locate this site in the Pgp structure and hence assess its potential to modify functional activity.
