WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: To date, there is no evidence to indicate the reliability of how patients self-report their own antibiotic usage in the community. Such data are fundamental in supporting antimicrobial stewardship practices, and so there is a need to determine its accuracy and reliability. COMMENT: Patients in the community (n = 476) were required to recollect their antibiotic usage in the past three months. Simultaneously, similar information was obtained by careful extraction from their respective medical notes, which was qualitatively compared with the patient's recollection. Overall, concordance was high (88.1%), but age (<20 and >80 years) and sex (female) were significant factors of reliability. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: This study suggests that basic self-reporting of antibiotic usage amongst patients is relatively reliable, with increasing accuracy with years until 80 years. Where such information is critical, the current study can help decide who to interview and whose notes to interrogate, in the quest to obtain reliable and accurate information.
