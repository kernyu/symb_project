OBJECTIVE: To assess the susceptibility of 100 isolates of Bacteroides spp. recovered in a major Costa Rican hospital between 2000 and 2008 to several ss-lactams, chloramphenicol, clindamycin and metronidazole. METHODS: Susceptibility to amoxicillin, amoxicillin with clavulanic acid, piperacillin, piperacillin with tazobactam, ticarcillin, ticarcillin with clavulanic acid, cefoxitin, cefotetan, imipenem, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, and metronidazole was determined with the ATB ANA(R) system. In addition, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of clindamycin and metronidazole were determined with the broth microdilution method because these drugs are the treatment of choice for anaerobic infections in Costa Rica. Reference strains ATCC(R) 25285 and ATCC(R) 29741 were employed as indicated. RESULTS: According to the ATB ANA(R) system, 93 isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic. Resistance to ss-lactams was common. By contrast, resistance to ss-lactams supplemented with ss-lactamase inhibitors was rare. All of the strains were inhibited by imipenem and chloramphenicol. By a broth microdilucion test, resistance to clindamycin was 20%, with MIC ranging from 64 mg/L to 256 mg/L; all of the strains were susceptible to metronidazole. CONCLUSIONS: The high MIC for clindamycin obtained for the majority of the resistant strains is highly suggestive of the presence of mechanisms of acquired resistance among the isolates, therefore surveillance studies are required to determine its efficacy. The low resistance to metronidazole observed underlines its value as a first-line drug. On the other hand, imipenem could be used to treat infections that do not respond well to metronidazole or clindamycin.
