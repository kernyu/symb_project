Oidium heveae, an obligate biotrophic pathogen of rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis), causes significant yield losses of rubber worldwide. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the interplay between O. heveae and rubber trees remain largely unknown. In this study, we isolated an O. heveae strain, named HN1106, from cultivated H. brasiliensis in Hainan, China. We found that O. heveae HN1106 triggers the hypersensitive response in a manner that depends on the effector-triggered immunity proteins EDS1 (Enhanced Disease Susceptibility 1) and PAD4 (Phytoalexin Deficient 4) and on salicylic acid (SA) in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. However, SA-independent resistance also appears to limit O. heveae infection of Arabidopsis, because the pathogen does not produce conidiospores on npr1 (nonexpressor of pr1), sid2 (SA induction deficient 2) and NahG plants, which show disruptions in SA signalling. Furthermore, we found that the callose synthase PMR4 (Powdery Mildew Resistant 4) prevents O. heveae HN1106 penetration into leaves in the early stages of infection. To elucidate the potential mechanism of resistance of Arabidopsis to O. heveae HN1106, we inoculated 47 different Arabidopsis accessions with the pathogen, and analysed the plant disease symptoms and O. heveae HN1106 hyphal growth and conidiospore formation on the leaves. We found that the accession Lag2-2 showed significant susceptibility to O. heveae HN1106. Overall, this study provides a basis for future research aimed at combatting powdery mildew caused by O. heveae in rubber trees.
