Lung infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly because of the rising antimicrobial resistance. According to the clinical setting, they can be categorized as community-acquired pneumonia and hospital-acquired pneumonia. Radiological patterns of lung infections are lobar consolidation, bronchopneumonia, interstitial pattern, and nodular pattern. In addition, typical imaging features of several infections serve as "red flag signs" in reaching a diagnosis or altering the management. It would be prudent for the radiologist to be well informed regarding these aspects of lung infections to be able to make a valuable contribution to the management.
