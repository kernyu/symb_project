BACKGROUND: Growth of drug resistance is related to number of microbial characteristics, selective pressure by antibiotic use and social and technical vicissitudes that enhance the transmission of antibiotic resistant organisms. The aim of this study was to investigate antimicrobial-resistance of Escherichia coli isolated from children in Shahid Sadoughi hospital of Yazd. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, antimicrobial susceptibility to cefixime , cefotaxime , ceftazidime , ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, imipenem, cotrimoxazole and nalidixic acid was determined for 148 E. coli isolates obtained from patients less than 18 years of age (hospitalized and outpatient) in Shahid Sadoughi hospital of Yazd. RESULTS: Ciprofloxacin was the most active antibacterial agent (78% susceptible), followed by gentamicin. High rates of resistance were observed for cefixime (57.9%) and cotrimoxazole. The results for ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, imipenem, cotrimoxazole and nalidixic acid were insignificant with P-value= 0.302, P-value= 0.550, P-value= 0.334, P-value= 0.084, P-value= 0.948, P-value= 0.686, P-value= 0.120 and P-value= 0.162, respectively. The results were significant for cefixime with P-value= 0.013. CONCLUSION: The investigation of antimicrobial susceptibility is essential, and will help to identify E. coli resistance to antimicrobial agents. It also helps to limit E. coli spread.
