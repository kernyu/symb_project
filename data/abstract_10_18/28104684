Although mutations drive cancer, it is less clear to what extent genetic defects control immune mechanisms and confer resistance to T-cell-based immunotherapy. Here, we studied the reactions of malignant and benign melanocyte lines to cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells (CTL) using flow cytometry and gene expression analyses. We found rapid and broad upregulation of immune-regulatory genes, essentially triggered by CTL-derived IFNgamma and augmented by TNFalpha. These reactions were predominantly homogenous, independent of oncogenic driver mutations, and similar in benign and malignant cells. The reactions exhibited both pro- and antitumorigenic potential and primarily corresponded to mechanisms that were conserved, rather than acquired, by mutations. Similar results were obtained from direct ex vivo analysis of the tumor microenvironment. Thus, immune regulation in the tumor landscape may often be driven by conserved mechanisms, which may explain why T-cell-based immunotherapy can provide durable benefits with relatively infrequent escape.
