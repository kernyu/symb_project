A menace of antimicrobial resistance with growing difficulties in eradicating clinical pathogens owing to the biofilm has prompted us to take up a facile aqueous-phase approach for the synthesis of silver nanowires (SNWs) by using ethylene glycol as a reducing agent and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a capping agent. This synthesis is a reflux reaction seedless process. The obtained SNWs were about 200-250 nm in diameter and up to 3-4 mum in length. The SNWs were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and X-Ray powder diffraction, and the chemical composition of the sample was examined by energy dispersive X-ray spectrum. The SNWs did not show an antibacterial activity against test organisms, Bacillus subtilis NCIM 2063 and Escherichia coli NCIM 2931; however, it showed a promising property of a quorum sensing-mediated inhibition of biofilm in Pseudomonas aeruginosa NCIM 2948 and violacein synthesis in Chromobacterium violaceum ATCC 12472, which is hitherto unattempted, by polyol approach.
