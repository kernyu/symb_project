Chemical modification of 16S rRNA can confer exceptionally high-level resistance to a diverse set of aminoglycoside antibiotics. Here, we show that the pathogen-derived enzyme NpmA possesses dual m(1)A1408/m(1)G1408 activity, an unexpected property apparently unique among the known aminoglycoside resistance 16S rRNA (m(1)A1408) methyltransferases. Although the biological significance of this activity remains to be determined, such mechanistic variation in enzymes acquired by pathogens has significant implications for development of inhibitors of these emerging resistance determinants.
