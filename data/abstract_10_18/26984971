The colistin-containing SuperPolymyxin medium was developed for screening polymyxin-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. It was evaluated with 88 polymyxin-susceptible or polymyxin-resistant cultured Gram-negative isolates. Its sensitivity and specificity of detection were ca. 100%. The SuperPolymyxin medium is the first screening medium that is able to detect intrinsic and acquired polymyxin-resistant bacteria.
