Results of application of LTP at atmospheric pressure as an antibacterial agent during the last decade are considered with reference to physicochemical mechanisms of its bactericidal action. The principles of designing modern LTP sources are described in conjunction with the results of LTP application against pathogenic bacteria in vitro and in biofilms. The possibility to destroy biofilm matrix by LTP is estimated along with the results of its testing for the treatment of acute and chronic wound surfaces. Prospects for the development of "plasma medicine" in this country and abroad are discussed with special emphasis on its advantages, such as the absence of long-acting toxic compounds, small probability of spontaneous mutations accounting for resistance to LTP, relatively low cost of LTP sources, independence of LTP effect of the surface relief, painless application.
