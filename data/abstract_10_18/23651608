Genetic polymorphisms observed in various disease states associated with sensitivity or resistance to specific treatments have been a robust area of investigation for decades, with the potential to allow clinicians to make evidence-based decisions on the appropriate course of treatment. This study aimed to evaluate whether genetic polymorphisms of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 gene (STAT6) could be associated with a sustained virological response (SVR) among patients infected with hepatitis C virus genotypes 1 and 2 (HCV-1 and HCV-2) who were treated with peginterferon plus ribavirin (PEG-IFNalpha-RBV). We analyzed the associations between SVR to PEG-IFNalpha-RBV therapy and 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in STAT6. This study included Taiwanese Chinese patients infected with either HCV-1 (n = 265) or HCV-2 (n = 195) in the presence or absence of an SVR. Among the STAT6 SNPs examined, the dosage effect of the A allele and allele frequency in rs1059513 were inversely correlated with SVR in patients infected with HCV-1 (P = 0.0179 and P = 0.0235, respectively). This effect was not observed in patients infected with HCV-2. The GG, GGG, and GGGC STAT6 haplotypes comprising 2, 3, and 4 SNPs (rs1059513, rs703817, rs324015, and rs3024974) were found to be associated with SVR, and their presence may increase the probability of a successful treatment outcome in patients infected with HCV-1 (P = 0.0273, 0.0352, and 0.0368, respectively). Moreover, a multivariate logistic regression model for predicting an SVR revealed that the presence of the GGGC haplotype carriers mutually affected the outcome of PEG-IFNalpha-RBV treatment. The presence of STAT6 SNPs and the association with SVR demonstrated that STAT6 polymorphisms might influence the therapeutic outcomes of patients infected with HCV-1 under standard-of-care (SOC) treatment.
