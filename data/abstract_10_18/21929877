In this study, we aimed to study the molecular and epidemiological characteristics of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) outbreak in Eastern Anatolia. Six hundred and thirty-seven patients from the same county with clinical diagnosis of typhoid fever were investigated with conventional methods from stool, urine and blood specimens. Antibiotic susceptibility tests and identifications were performed for positive specimens. Clonal relationships between the isolates were investigated using pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) method. A questionnaire was completed for the water consumption habits of patients. Of 91 culture positive specimens, 76 were blood, 13 were stool and 2 were urine. The isolates were resistant to ampicillin, ampicillin/sulbactam, chloramphenicol, cefuroxime, amikacin, gentamicin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Although there was a single band difference in some isolates, PFGE results indicated that this was an outbreak caused by single strain according to the Tenover criteria. This outbreak thought to be associated with the consumption of tap water contaminated with sewage represents a breakdown of the basic public health and civil engineering infrastructure. Appropriate public health measures should be taken in order to avoid such outbreaks in the future.
