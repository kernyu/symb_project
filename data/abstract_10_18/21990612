Antivirulence drugs disarm rather than kill pathogens and are thought to alleviate the problem of resistance, although there is no evidence to support this notion. Quorum sensing (QS) often controls cooperative virulence factor production and is therefore an attractive antivirulence target, for which inhibitors (QSI) have been developed. We designed a proof-of-principle experiment to investigate the impact of bacterial social interactions on the evolution of QSI resistance. We cocultured Pseudomonas aeruginosa QS-deficient mutants with small proportions of the QS-proficient wild type, which in the absence of QSI mimic QSI-sensitive and -resistant variants, respectively. We employed two different QS-dependent nutrients that are degraded by extracellular (public) and cell-associated (private) enzymes. QS mutants (QSI-sensitive mimics) behaved as social cheaters that delayed population growth and prevented enrichment of wild-type cooperators (QSI-resistant mimics) only when nutrient acquisition was public, suggesting that QSI resistance would not spread. This highlights the potential for antivirulence strategies that target cooperative behaviors and provides a conceptual framework for future studies.
