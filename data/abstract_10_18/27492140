The aim of this study was to investigate the current published work relating to the clinical benefits of the use of systemic azithromycin as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal therapy. A published work search of PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials up to 27 April 2016 was undertaken. The large degree of heterogeneity in the types of studies, treatment protocols, test subjects, sample size and exclusion criteria indicated that the use of narrative synthesis of all relevant studies was a valid method of review. Of the 194 eligible studies, 15 were found to be of relevance. The majority of studies demonstrated an additional clinical benefit when azithromycin is used as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal therapy, particularly in deeper pockets (>/=6 mm). In conclusion, the current body of research on the adjunctive use of systemic azithromycin in non-surgical periodontal therapy suggests there is a clinical benefit and that this benefit is greatest in deeper initial pockets (>/=6 mm). The findings also suggest that future studies need to be more careful in subject selection to identify susceptible patients or at risk sites, both the immunoregulatory effects and antibiotic resistance of azithromycin needs to be reported, and that study populations need to be more homogeneous.
