It is noted that more than 99 % of fluoroquinolone resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae (QRNG) specimens have been shown to have the mutation of Ser91/Phe in the gyrA gene. In order to detect QRNG isolates as quickly as possible, the real-time TaqMan quantitative PCR assay was established for detection of the point mutation of Ser91/Phe in gyrA gene. The standard curve was generated automatically on ABI Prism PE7500. The correlation coefficient (r) of the standard curve was -0.9984 (R(2) = 0.9968), indicating a quietly precise log-linear relationship between the concentration of target DNA and the Ct value. Presently, correlated, cultured antimicrobial susceptibility testing of N. gonorrhoeae isolates continues to be the gold standard method for the detection of antimicrobial resistance. Comparison to the correlated, cultured antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the sensitivity and specificity of the established TaqMan assay for the detection of the QRNG specimens were 100 and 99 %, respectively. The TaqMan assay also allows for rapid detection of QRNG isolates without complex laboratory techniques. Therefore, real-time TaqMan quantitative PCR assay is a rapid, simple, highly sensitive, highly specific, and easy-to-perform method for the detection of the QRNG specimens. It can be applied as a quick screening method for QRNG isolates to help clinical determination of optimal treatment prescription.
