Thioridazine (TZ), an antipsychotic drug, renders multidrug-resistant (MDR) cancer cells susceptible to cytotoxic agents to which they were initially resistant, has anti-prolilferative activity and apoptosis-inducing properties in various tumor cell lines and cancer stem cells. Whereas the anti-proliferative activity takes place at high concentrations that ensure the intercalation of the compound between nucleic bases (especially rich in G/C bases), much lower concentrations inhibit the export function of the ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein), which is responsible for the MDR phenotype of the cancer cell. The co-administration of TZ with doxorubicin inhibits efflux of doxorubicin and, hence, increases the intracellular concentration of anticancer drug. The (+) and (-) enantiomers of TZ have the same activities as TZ. The main focus of this review is to present extensive evidence provided by our work, confirmed by much later studies, as it supports adjuvant use of TZ with an anticancer drug for MDR cancer therapy.
