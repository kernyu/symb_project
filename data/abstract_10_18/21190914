Fifty clinical isolates comprising of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella and Proteus were collected from different local pathological laboratories and their resistant pattern against two well known macrolides; erythromycin and clarithromycin were studied using disc diffusion method. Klebsiella (41.67% against erythromycin and 58.34% against clarithromycin) and Proteus (66.67% against erythromycin and clarithromycin) species were found to be more resistant against the studied macrolides as compared to the rest of organisms. In case of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia.coli, resistant found were 27.78% and 23.54% against erythromycin and 22.23% and 35.30% against clarithromycin respectively. It is concluded from these figures that microbial resistance against these macrolides are increasing in our population which is alarming and therefore it is recommended to physicians to prescribe these antibiotics unless no other substitute is available in clinical practices.
