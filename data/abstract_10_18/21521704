The worldwide spread of multidrug-resistant organisms has required the development of new antimicrobials. Linezolid, the first oxazolidinone, has a broad spectrum of activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including resistant strains. Although approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2002, the clinical experience with linezolid in the paediatric population is still limited, also given the fact that in most European countries the paediatric use of linezolid is off-label. In this paper we summarize the actual evidence on both licensed and off-label clinical uses of linezolid in children, including efficacy, safety and tolerability issues. Taking into account the potential bias in comparing heterogeneous clinical trials and reports, the available literature data suggest that linezolid is a safe and effective agent for the treatment of serious Gram-positive bacterial infections in neonates and children. At present, linezolid is reserved for those children who are intolerant to or fail conventional agents. A linezolid-containing regimen can be a valuable option for treating multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in children as well as disseminated non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections. Given the rare occurrence of serious side effects, careful monitoring of haematological parameters, possible drug interactions and neurological manifestations is recommended in linezolid-treated children, especially in case of prolonged treatments. Appropriate linezolid dosage and hospital infection control measures are essential to avoid the spread of linezolid resistance. Further studies are needed to establish novel paediatric indications for linezolid use and to assess the tolerability of long-term treatments.
