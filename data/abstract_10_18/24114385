Bacillus thuringiensis PW-05 was isolated from the Odisha coast and was found to resist 50 ppm of Hg as HgCl2 as well as higher concentrations of CdCl2, ZnSO4, PbNO3 and Na2HAsO4. Resistance towards several antibiotics, viz amoxycillin, ampicillin, methicillin, azithromycin and cephradine (CV) was also observed. The mer operon possessed by most of the mercury-resistant bacteria was also found in this isolate. Atomic absorption spectroscopy revealed that the isolate can volatilize >90 % of inorganic mercury. It showed biofilm formation in the presence of 50 ppm HgCl2 and can produce exopolysaccharide under same conditions. The isolate was found to volatilize mercury efficiently under a wide range of environmental parameters, i.e. pH (7 to 8), temperature (25 degrees C to 40 degrees C) and salinity (5 to 25 ppt). merA gene expression has been confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR study. Fourier transform infrared study revealed that -SH and -COOH groups play a major role in the process of adaptation to Hg. Hence, this isolate B. thuringiensis PW-05 shows an interesting potential for bioremediation of mercury.
