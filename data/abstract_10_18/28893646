OBJECTIVES: In recent years, Klebsiella pneumoniae has emerged as a leading cause of nosocomial infection owing to the rising prevalence of multidrug-resistant strains, particularly carbapenem-resistant isolates. In this study, the complete genome sequence of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae SWU01 was determined. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibilities and hypermucoviscous phenotype were determined by the disk diffusion method and positive string test, respectively. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was performed using the K. pneumoniae MLST database, and capsular serotype was analysed using the BIGSdb-Kp database with the nucleotide sequence of the variable region (CD1-VR2-CD2) of wzc. The complete genome sequence was obtained via the PacBio RS II platform, and antimicrobial resistance genes were identified using ResFinder 2.1. RESULTS: SWU01 was resistant to all antibiotics tested except polymyxin B and minocycline. This strain showed a hypermucoviscous phenotype with serotype K47 belonging to the ST11 clone. The complete genome consists of a 5536506-bp circular chromosome and a 162552-bp plasmid, with a G+C content of 57.4%. A total of 5537 protein-coding sequences, 85 tRNAs, 25 rRNAs, 12 non-coding RNA genes and 157 pseudogenes were identified in the genome. Thirteen acquired antibiotic resistance genes were detected (eight in the chromosome and five in the plasmid). CONCLUSIONS: Here we present the first whole-genome sequence of a carbapenem-resistant hypermucoviscous K. pneumoniae isolate SWU01 with capsular serotype K47 belonging to ST11 from a patient in China, which may serve as a reference sequence for further understanding of the pathogenesis and multidrug resistance mechanisms of this species.
