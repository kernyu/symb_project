PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review looks at the recent evidence on the safety, toxicity, microbiology and the prevention and management of acute and chronic wound infections with regard to antiseptics and antiseptic wound dressings. It is timely and relevant because of the global concerns of antimicrobial resistance and the need to address the inappropriate use of antimicrobials in the healthcare setting. RECENT FINDINGS: There have been a number of recent Cochrane reviews that have concluded that there is little evidence to delineate clinical outcomes between antiseptics and antiseptic dressings. Published in-vitro evidence offers some new techniques and evaluates some new dressings and antiseptics. There are no economic evaluations of antiseptics and antiseptic dressings. SUMMARY: Better clinical trials on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of wound dressings are needed to ensure evidence-based guidance is developed for optimizing the treatment of patients. It is surprising that with the paucity of evidence of clinical effectiveness, healthcare organizations continue to spend considerable resources on poorly evaluated topical wound products.
