New drugs active against drug-resistant tuberculosis are urgently needed to extend the range of TB treatment options to cover drug resistant infections. Quinoxaline derivatives show very interesting biological properties (antibacterial, antiviral, anticancer, antifungal, antihelmintic, insecticidal) and evaluation of their medicinal chemistry is still in progress. In this review we report the properties and the recent developments of quinoxaline 1,4-di-N-oxide derivatives as potential anti-tuberculosis agents. Specific agents are reviewed that have excellent antitubercular drug properties, are active on drug resistant strains and non-replicating mycobacteria. The properties of select analogs that have in vivo activity in the low dose aerosol infection model in mice will be reviewed.
