A total of 18,386 organisms, including 13,224 Enterobacteriaceae, 3536 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1254 Acinetobacter spp., and 372Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were collected from Western Europe (WEU; n=10,021), Eastern Europe (EEU; n=4957), and the Asia-Pacific region (APAC; n=3408 [1052 from China]) in 2013-2014 as part of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program and tested by a reference broth microdilution method for susceptibility against tigecycline, cefoperazone/sulbactam, and comparator agents. Overall, 95.3% of Enterobacteriaceae were susceptible (</=1mug/mL; EUCAST) to tigecycline (MIC50/90, 0.12/1mug/mL) with regional EUCAST susceptibility rates of 94.8-97.8% (98.9-99.6% inhibited at </=2mug/mL [US FDA]). Among Acinetobacter spp., 66.1% (EEU) and 79.5% (WEU) were inhibited at </=1mug/mL of tigecycline (94.9% and 97.3% inhibited at </=2mug/mL; pan-European MIC50/90, 1/2mug/mL). For S. maltophilia, 65.4% (China) to 88.9% (EEU) of the isolates were inhibited at </=1mug/mL of tigecycline. Cefoperazone/sulbactam inhibited 94.6/83.5/91.5% of Enterobacteriaceae at </=16mug/mL in WEU/EEU/APAC, respectively.
