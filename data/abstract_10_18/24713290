OBJECTIVE: To explore the phenetic and genetic features of clinical Vibrio parahaemolyticus strains from 2007-2009 in China. METHODS: A total of 135 clinical Vibrio parahaemolyticus strains, isolated from Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Sichuan, Guangxi, Liaoning Provinces during 2007 to 2009, were selected for the research. The occurrence of virulence genes thermostable direct hemolysin (tdh) and TDH-related hemolysin (trh), species-specific genes thermolabile hemolysin (tlh), toxR, VPM and gyrB, the pandemic clone gene markers(GS-PCR, PGS-PCR, orf8 and HU-alpha) in 135 Vibrio parahaemolyticus strains was detected by PCR. The antimicrobial susceptibilities to eight antimicrobial agents of the experimental strains were determined by the broth microdilution method. All strains were serotyped and underwent the cluster analysis with pulsed-field gel electrophoreses. RESULTS: The results of PCR methods claim that all experiment strains carry species-specific genes such as tlh, toxR, gyrB, VPM. Among clinical strains, 85.9% (116/135) carry tdh and/or trh. 85.2% (115/135) were positive for tdh, and 3.0% (4/135) were positive for trh; while 3 strains carried both.66.7% (90/135) , 80.7% (109/135) , 65.2% (88/135) , 66.7% (90/135) clinical strains carried the genes of GS-PCR, PGS-PCR, orf8, HU-alpha, respectively. The results of antibiotics susceptibility test showed that 8.1% (11/135) strains were resistant to at least one agent, including 9 strains were resistant to ampicillin, 2 strains were resistant to trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole, and 1 strain were resistant to tetracycline. All clinical strains were sensitive to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and chloromycetin.Serological analysis of the O and K antigens claimed that a total of 29 serotypes were identified for clinical strains, predominantly O3, O4 and O1 groups, accounting for 89.6% (121/135). O3: K6 was dominant serotype, accounting for 56.3% (76/135). The pandemic flora in China included O3: K6, O4: K68, O1: K36, O1: K25, O1: K5 and O3: K29 serotypes.Genomic DNAs of 135 clinical strains were digested with SfiI and NotI, the molecular size of PFGE restriction fragments used for analysis mainly ranged from 30-700 kb.When subjected to UPGMA clustering, 6 and 9 clusters were grouped by SfiI and NotI, and the minimal similarity was 52.6% and 58.7%, and pandemic flora were located in C groups and D group, respectively. CONCLUSION: Most of Vibrio parahaemolyticus strains isolated from clinical sources in China were pathogenic. The pandemic clone, especially O3: K6 was prevalent. The GS-PCR and HU-alpha genes were reliable markers to identify the pandemic flora. The serotype by PFGE was reliable to distinguish the pandemic flora and the sporadic strains.
