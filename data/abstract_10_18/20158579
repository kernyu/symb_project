Dietary application of dried Rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaves as a treatment for streptococcal infection was studied in tilapia, Oreochromis sp. Feeding with dried rosemary leaves significantly reduced mortality following infection with Streptococcus iniae: 44% mortality in the group fed 8% rosemary, similar to oxytetracycline treatment (43% mortality), and significantly lower than the control (65%). Dietary administration of 16% rosemary significantly reduced mortality because of Streptococcus agalactiae infection in 44 g fish (62% and 76% in 16% rosemary and control, respectively), but not in a similar experiment conducted with 5.5 g fish. The antibacterial effect of rosemary on S. iniae was studied. Activity of rosemary cultivar Israel was reduced during the winter, but there was no significant change in cultivars Oranit and Star. Storage of powdered rosemary leaves at 50 degrees C resulted in fourfold and eightfold higher MIC(24 h) values after 3 and 4.5 months, respectively. Storage at -20 degrees C, 4 degrees C and 25 degrees C and autoclaving (120 degrees C) each resulted in a twofold increase in MIC(24 h). Repeated exposures of S. iniae to rosemary did not affect minimal inhibitory concentration, suggesting no development of resistance to rosemary.
