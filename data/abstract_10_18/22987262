We performed a antibiotic resistance study on Enterococcus faecium isolated from intrahospitalary and extrahospitalary samples between 2004 and 2010. Three different samples were studied; urine, blood and wound swabs, considering a strain per patient. We included in the study a global amount of 637 E. faecium isolares. We employed semiautomatic system WIDER I for identification and sensitivity testing. We considered susceptibility and resistance criteria recommended by MENSURA group. We found a susceptibility rate of 48.05% to betalactams, 100% to linezolid, and 99.46% to vancomycin. The resistance to aminoglycosides ranged between 41.41 and 73.55%. We obtained 6 isolates resistant to vancomycin one of them from an extrahospitalary strain and five from intrahospitalary strains. It seems that vancomycin resistance should be controlled.
