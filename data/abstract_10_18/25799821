D test is a simple disc diffusion test giving high throughput results. It is used to study the macrolide lincosamide streptogramin resistance (MLSB), both constitutive and inducible as well as macrolide streptogramin resistance (MSB) in Staphylococcus aureus. In this test, erythromycin (macrolide) and clindamycin (lincosamide derivative) discs are placed adjacent to each other over the Mueller Hinton agar medium inoculated with the test organism. The growth of the organism up to the edges of the disc, flattening of the clindamycin zone (D test positive) near the erythromycin disc (resistant) and susceptible to both antibiotics implicate that the organism is having constitutive MLSB (CMLSB), inducible MLSB (IMLSB) and no resistance respectively. Further, the organism susceptible to clindamycin without any flattening of the zone (D test negative) near clindamycin disc (resistant) implicates that the organism is having macrolide streptogramin resistance (MSB). The test is performed in the same MHA plate in which the antibiotic sensitivity test is being done, taking into consideration that the discs are placed adjacent to each other maintaining the distance. Since clindamycin and streptogramin are among the few drugs of choice in the treatment of methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections, knowing the resistance to these antibiotics is imperative.
