PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recent evidence demonstrates that the gut-microbiota can be considered as one of the major factors causing metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. RECENT FINDINGS: Pattern recognition receptors as well as antimicrobial peptides are a key factor in controlling the intestinal microbiota composition. Deficiencies in these genes lead to changes in the composition of the gut-microbiota, causing leakage of endotoxins into the circulation, and the development of low-grade chronic inflammation and insulin resistance. Dietary composition can also affect the microbiota: a diet rich in saturated fats allows the expansion of pathobionts that damage the intestinal epithelial cell layer and compromise its barrier function. In contrast, a diet high in fiber supports the microbiota to produce short-chain fatty acids, thereby promoting energy expenditure and protecting against inflammation and insulin resistance. SUMMARY: The interactions between the microbiota, innate immunity, and diet play an important role in controlling metabolic homeostasis. A properly functioning innate immune system, combined with a low-fat and high-fiber diet, is important in preventing dysbiosis and reducing the susceptibility to developing the metabolic syndrome and its associated cardiovascular diseases.
