OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro susceptibility of vaginal Candida albicans to common antifungal drugs in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January to September 2008, 150 women with leucorrhoea were sampled for vaginal mycosis at the Pasteur Institute (Ivory Coast). Samples were analyzed by direct examination, Sabouraud-chloramphenicol and Sabouraud-chloramphenicol-actidione culture. C. albicans was identified after blastesis, chlamydosporulation and auxanogram tests. The susceptibility of this fungus to amphotericine B, 5-fluorocytosine, fluconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole was evaluated by a semi-solid medium microdilution technique: ATB((R)) Fungus 3. RESULTS: Among 62 yeasts strains isolated, C. albicans represented 45 cases or 72.6%. Vaginal itching (P=0.04) and urinary burning (P=0.002) was statistically correlated with vaginal candidosis. We observed a range of susceptibility of C. albicans strains to antifungals: 100% to amphotericine B (CMI90=0.5mug/mL); 98% to 5-fluorocytosine (CMI90=4mug/mL); 86.7% to voriconazole (CMI50=0.06mug/mL) and 80% to fluconazole (CMI50=2mug/mL and CMI90=32mug/mL). However, only 46.7% of C. albicans strains were sensitive to itraconazole (CMI50=0.125mug/mL). CONCLUSION: These results show that vaginal C. albicans remain sensitive to the most commonly antifungal drugs used in Abidjan. However, this susceptibility should be regularly monitored.
