INTRODUCTION: Chlamydiae are obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens whose entry into mucosal epithelial cells is required for intracellular survival and subsequent growth. The life cycle of Chlamydia spp. and the ability to cause persistent, often subclinical infection, has major ramifications for diagnosis and treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis and C. pneumoniae infections in humans. AREAS COVERED: This paper reviews the current literature on the antimicrobial susceptibilities and treatment of genital infections due to C. trachomatis and respiratory infections due to C. pneumoniae published since 2011. EXPERT OPINION: Chlamydiae are susceptible to antibiotics that interfere with DNA and protein synthesis, including tetracyclines, macrolides and quinolones, which are the compounds that have been most extensively studied and used for treatment of human infection. Since our original review was published in 2011, there have been some major advances in diagnostic tests for C. trachomatis and the introduction of the first FDA-approved test for the detection of C. pneumoniae in respiratory samples. However, the options for treating chlamydial infections have largely remained the same. There are a small number of new drugs currently in preclinical development and early clinical trials that may have a role in the treatment of chlamydial infections.
