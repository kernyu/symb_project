Microbial colonization and biofilm formation on implanted devices represent an important complication in orthopaedic and dental surgery and may result in implant failure. Controlled release of antibacterial agents directly at the implant site may represent an effective approach to treat these chronic complications. Resistance to conventional antibiotics by pathogenic bacteria has emerged in recent years as a major problem of public health. In order to overcome this problem, non-conventional antimicrobial agents have been under investigation. In this study, polyacrylate-based hydrogel thin coatings have been electrosynthesised on titanium substrates starting from poly(ethylene glycol diacrylate)-co-acrylic acid. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with a narrow size distribution have been synthesized using a "green" procedure and immobilized on Ti implant surfaces exploiting hydrogel coatings' swelling capabilities. The coatings have been characterized by XPS and SEM/EDX, while their silver release performances have been monitored by ICP-MS. The antibacterial activity of these AgNP-modified hydrogel coatings was tested evaluating in vitro inhibition growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, among the most common pathogens in orthopaedic infections. Moreover, a preliminary investigation of the biocompatibility of silver-loaded coatings versus MG63 human osteoblast-like cells has been performed. An important point of strength of this paper, in fact, is the concern about the effect of silver species on the surrounding cell system in implanted medical devices. Silver ion release has been properly tuned in order to assure antibacterial activity while preserving osteoblasts' response at the implant interface.
