Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a granulomatous disease caused by a dimorphic fungus, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (Pb). To determine the influence of nitric oxide (NO) on this disease, we tested cis-[Ru(bpy)2(NO)SO3](PF6), ruthenium nitrosyl, which releases NO when activated by biological reducing agents, in BALB/c mice infected intravenously with Pb 18 isolate. In a previous study by our group, the fungicidal activity of ruthenium nitrosyl was evaluated in a mouse model of acute PCM, by measuring the immune cellular response (DTH), histopathological characteristics of the granulomatous lesions (and numbers), cytokines, and NO production. We found that cis-[Ru(bpy)2(NO)SO3](PF6)-treated mice were more resistant to infection, since they exhibited higher survival when compared with the control group. Furthermore, we observed a decreased influx of inflammatory cells in the lung and liver tissue of treated mice, possibly because of a minor reduction in fungal cell numbers. Moreover, an increased production of IL-10 and a decrease in TNF-alpha levels were detected in lung tissues of infected mice treated with cis-[Ru(bpy)2(NO)SO3](PF6). Immunohistochemistry showed that there was no difference in the number of VEGF- expressing cells. The animals treated with cis-[Ru(bpy)2(NO)SO3](PF6) showed high NO levels at 40 days after infection. These results show that NO is effectively involved in the mechanism that regulates the immune response in lung of Pb-infected mice. These data suggest that NO is a resistance factor during paracoccidioidomycosis by controlling fungal proliferation, influencing cytokine production, and consequently moderating the development of a strong inflammatory response.
