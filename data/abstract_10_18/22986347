BACKGROUND: We recently reported that long-term cyclosporine (CsA)-induced oxidative stress is associated with decreased expression of klotho, an anti-aging gene. This study evaluated whether the antioxidant effect of statin might upregulate klotho expression in CsA-induced renal injury. METHODS: Two separate experiments were performed. First, the dose-dependent effect of statin on klotho expression was evaluated in normal mouse kidneys. Second, the effect of statin on klotho expression was evaluated in experimental chronic CsA nephropathy in mice. We performed immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting for klotho, Forkhead box O transcription factors [FoxOs; phosphorylated FoxO1 (p-FoxO1) and FoxO3a (p-FoxO3a)] and their target molecules, manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), Bim and hemeoxygenase-1. RESULTS: Statin treatment upregulated klotho expression in a dose-dependent manner in the normal mouse kidney and alleviated the decrease in klotho expression in kidneys exhibiting CsA nephropathy. CsA administration increased p-FoxO1 expression and decreased p-FoxO3a expression, whereas concurrent statin treatment reversed these changes, increased the expression of the antioxidant enzymes MnSOD and hemeoxygenase-1 and decreased the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim. CONCLUSION: Statin-mediated upregulation of klotho expression and differential regulation of FoxO expression promote resistance to CsA-induced oxidative stress.
