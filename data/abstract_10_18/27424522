UNLABELLED: Previous work reported that decoated Bacillus cereus spores incubated in 4 mol l(-1) CaCl2 are killed at lower temperatures than spores in water. This wet heat sensitization was suggested to support a role for an osmoregulatory peptidoglycan cortex in spore cores' low water content, and their wet heat resistance. Current work has replicated this finding with spores of B. cereus, Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus subtilis. However, this work found that decoated spores apparently killed at 80 degrees C in 4 mol l(-1) CaCl2 : (i) were recovered on plates containing lysozyme; (ii) lost no dipicolinic acid (DPA) and their inner membrane remained impermeable; (iii) released no DPA upon stimulation with nutrient germinants and could not complete germination; and (iv) released DPA relatively normally upon stimulation with dodecylamine. These results indicate that decoated spores treated with 80 degrees C- 4 mol l(-1) CaCl2 are not dead, but some protein(s) essential for spore germination, most likely germinant receptors, are inactivated by this treatment. Thus, the original finding does not support a role for an osmoregulatory cortex in spore wet heat resistance. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Bacillus spores' low core water content is a major factor in their wet heat resistance. One suggested mechanism for achieving low spore core water content is osmoregulated expansion of spores' peptidoglycan cortex. Evidence for this mechanism includes a report that decoated Bacillus cereus spores incubated in 4 mol l(-1) CaCl2 exhibit drastically reduced heat resistance. The current work shows that this heat sensitization of decoated spores of three Bacillus species is most likely due to inactivation of some crucial spore germination protein(s), since while treated spores appear dead, their apparent low viability is rescued by triggering spore germination with lysozyme.
