In this study, significant contamination in the intensive care unit environment was observed (P < .004). Sampling of inanimate surfaces and equipment found vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, ciprofloxacin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and S epidermidis, and multiresistant Acinetobacter baumannii with similarities (60%-80%) to blood culture isolates.
