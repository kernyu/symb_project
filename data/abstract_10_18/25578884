Postinfluenza bacterial pneumonia is a leading cause of influenza-associated death, and Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae have been important pathogens that have caused pneumonia since the influenza pandemic in 1919. Emergence of novel influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 and the concomitant global spread of community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) have led to increasing prevalence of CA-MRSA pneumonia following influenza infection. Such an epidemiologic change poses a therapeutic challenge due to a high risk of inappropriate empiric antimicrobial therapy and poor clinical outcomes. Early diagnosis and initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy for post-influenza bacterial pneumonia have become even more important in the era of CA-MRSA. Therefore, novel molecular diagnostic techniques should be applied to more readily diagnose MRSA pneumonia.
