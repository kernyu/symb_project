OBJECTIVE: To determine the molecular characterization of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) isolates from a tertiary center in Saudi Arabia using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique and assess their antibiotic susceptibility pattern. METHODS: Prospective study conducted at the Saudi Aramco Dhahran Health Center, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia between April-December 2006. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases phenotype of isolates identified by automated methods was confirmed using E-test. Multiplex PCR for the detection of blaTEM, blaSHV and blaCTX-M was performed. Susceptibility to a panel of antibiotics was determined. RESULTS: One hundred isolates (Escherichia coli [E.coli] n=84; Klebsiella pneumoniae [K. pneumoniae] n=16) were studied and 71% harbored the blaCTX-M gene. For E.coli isolates 43 (51%) harbored CTX-M+TEM combination and 21 (25%) had CTX-M alone. In contrast, only one K. pneumoniae isolate (6.2%) harbored the CTX-M+TEM combination and 3 (18.8%) isolates had CTX-M only. One E.coli and 7 K. pneumoniae isolates were blaSHV positive. The blaCTX-M gene was found predominantly in urinary isolates (n=63/71; 88.7%). The presence of blaCTX-M was significantly higher in isolates from outpatients compared to inpatient (p<0.05). Sensitivity to imipenem was 100% and 78% to nitrofurantoin. Resistance to amoxicillin-sulbactam was significantly higher in blaCTX-M positive isolates (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The findings indicate a high-level of blaCTX-M positive ESBL isolates circulating in our setting with the dissemination of these in the community. The trend of multidrug resistance profile associated with carriage of blaCTX-M gene is cause for concern.
