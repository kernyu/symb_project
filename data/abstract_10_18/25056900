In varicella-zoster virus (VZV)-infected primary human brain vascular adventitial fibroblasts (BRAFs), levels of beta interferon (IFN-beta,) STAT1, and STAT2 transcripts as well as STAT1 and STAT2 protein were decreased. IFN-alpha transcript levels were increased but not secreted IFN-alpha protein levels. Compared to IFN-alpha-treated control results, in VZV-infected BRAFs, phosphorylated STAT1 did not translocate to the nucleus, resulting in impaired downstream expression of interferon-inducible antiviral Mx1. Overall, VZV interference with the type I interferon pathway may promote virus persistence in cerebral arteries.
