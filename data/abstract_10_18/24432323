Candida is a yeast species recognized as the most frequent etiological agent of systemic and invasive thrush in humans. Invasions can affect all tissues, organs and systems of human in various stages of development. In the last 10 years Candida infections have increased 15 times. The purpose of our study was to determine the sensitivity of four antibiotics belonging to three different groups of antifungal agents against clinical and food-borne Candida strains. Our studies showed that of all tested strains, 7% was resistant to nystatin, 32% to fluconazole, 23% to voriconazole, and no strains grew in the presence of caspofungin. Despite the differences in biochemical profiles of clinical and food-borne isolates of Candida, a group of strains showing resistance to antibiotics include both types of isolates. At the same time circulating of antibiotic-resistant strains outside the hospital environment and the yeast infection via food is possible.
