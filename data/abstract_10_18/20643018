OBJECTIVE: Little information is available concerning the treatment of pediatric head and neck infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which is resistant to antimicrobial agents such as cephalosporins. The objective of this investigation is to describe clinical characteristics of pediatric MRSA head and neck infections in the United States and how they are treated. DESIGN: National survey. SETTING: United States. METHODS: Practicing members of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery were surveyed regarding patients aged < 18 years with MRSA head and neck infections during 2006. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical characteristics and treatment of pediatric MRSA infections. RESULTS: Of 701 surveys sent, 201 were completed (adjusted response rate 30%). Otolaryngologists responding to the survey reported treating a total of 1123 pediatric MRSA head and neck infections in 2006. Forty-seven percent reported treating pediatric patients with MRSA infections in the otologic region, 39% in the oropharyngeal/neck region, and 17% in the sinonasal region. The antimicrobials most frequently used to treat these infections were clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and vancomycin. Cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones were also commonly prescribed. CONCLUSIONS: Otolaryngologists in the United States reported treating a broad range of MRSA head and neck infections in pediatric patients. Although most were treated with appropriate antimicrobials, some were treated with agents not active against MRSA.
