BACKGROUND: One of the most frequent adverse effects of interferon-alpha therapy is thyroiditis. Metformin was found to improve insulin sensitivity in hepatitis C patients, as well as to reduce elevated thyrotropin levels in patients with hypothyroidism. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of metformin on hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis activity in patients with interferon-induced thyroiditis. METHODS: The study included 2 matched groups of women with type 2 diabetes and untreated subclinical hypothyroidism: patients with interferon-induced thyroiditis (n=8) and patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (n=12). Fasting plasma glucose, the homeostatic model assessment 1 of insulin resistance ratio (HOMA1-IR), glycated hemoglobin, the estimated glomerular filtration rate, as well as serum levels of thyrotropin, thyroid hormones, prolactin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) were assessed at baseline and after 4 months of metformin treatment. RESULTS: Apart from reducing plasma glucose, HOMA1-IR and glycated hemoglobin, metformin decreased serum levels of thyrotropin. Circulating levels of thyroid hormones, prolactin and IGF-1 remained at a similar level throughout the study. The effect of metformin on serum thyrotropin was stronger in patients with interferon-induced thyroiditis than in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, as well as correlated with its impact on insulin sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that metformin may be an effective agent in patients with interferon-induced hypothyroidism.
