It is unclear whether the genetic background of drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa was disseminated from a certain clone. Thus, we performed MLST (multilocus sequence typing) of 896 P. aeruginosa isolates that were nonsusceptible to imipenem, meropenem, or ceftazidime. This revealed 254 sequence types (STs), including 104 new STs and 34 STs with novel alleles. Thirty-three clonal complexes and 404 singletons were found. In conclusion, drug-resistant P. aeruginosa clones can be developed from diverse genetic backgrounds.
