Multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli can contaminate food meat during processing and cause human infection. Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of the antimicrobial resistance were conducted for 45 multidrug-resistant E. coli isolates from 208 samples of beef carcasses. The mechanisms of resistance were evaluated using polymerase chain reaction and sequencing methods, and the clonal relationship among isolates was evaluated using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Different variants of bla, tet, flo, dfrA, and aadA genes were detected in most of the strains resistant to beta-lactam, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, sulfonamides, and aminoglycosides, respectively. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli was found in 42.2% of the 45 E. coli isolates and the most commonly detected ESBL genotypes were CTX-M group 1 and 9. Class 1 integrons with nine different arrangements of gene cassettes were present in 28 of 45 E. coli isolates. Twenty-nine PFGE groups and 24 MLST types were identified in their clonal structure. This study revealed that E. coli isolates from beef contained high diversity of antimicrobial resistance genes, integrons, and genotypes. These results highlighted the role of beef meat as a potential source for multidrug-resistant E. coli strains and the need for controlling beef safety.
