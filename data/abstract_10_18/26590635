Each month, Chemistry & Biology Select highlights a selection of research reports from the recent literature. These highlights are a snapshot of interesting research done across the field of chemical biology. Our November 2015 selection includes an insight into non-overlapping biosynthetic pathways that lead to formation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis peptidoglycan, a new method to not only measure but also buffer the endosomal pH using nanoparticles, and a demonstration that non-coding RNAs can be a target for antibiotic discovery.
