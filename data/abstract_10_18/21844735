Neisseria gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequence typing technique demonstrated multiple sexual transmission networks in Ontario, Canada.

Neisseria gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequence typing technique can be a useful tool for investigation of multidrug-resistant N. gonorrhoeae emergence in North America.
