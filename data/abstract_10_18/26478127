BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Abnormal Ca(2+) metabolism has been involved in the pathogenesis of vascular dysfunction associated with oxidative stress. Here, we have investigated the actions of H2 O2 on store-operated Ca(2+) (SOC) entry in coronary arteries and assessed whether it is impaired in arteries from a rat model of metabolic syndrome. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Simultaneous measurements of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration and contractile responses were made in coronary arteries from Wistar and obese Zucker rats, mounted in microvascular myographs, and the effects of H2 O2 were assessed. KEY RESULTS: H2 O2 raised intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations, accompanied by simultaneous vasoconstriction that was markedly reduced in a Ca(2+) -free medium. Upon Ca(2+) re-addition, a nifedipine-resistant sustained Ca(2+) entry, not coupled to contraction, was obtained in endothelium-denuded coronary arteries. The effect of H2 O2 on this voltage-independent Ca(2+) influx was concentration-dependent, and high micromolar H2 O2 concentrations were inhibitory and reduced SOC entry evoked by inhibition of the sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase (SERCA). H2 O2 -induced increases in Fura signals were mimicked by Ba(2+) and reduced by heparin, Gd(3+) ions and by Pyr6, a selective inhibitor of the Orai1-mediated Ca(2+) entry,. In coronary arteries from obese Zucker rats, intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization and SOC entry activated by acute exposure to H2 O2 were augmented and associated with local oxidative stress. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: H2 O2 exerted dual concentration-dependent stimulatory/inhibitory effects on store-operated, IP3 receptor-mediated and Orai1-mediated Ca(2+) entry, not coupled to vasoconstriction in coronary vascular smooth muscle. SOC entry activated by H2 O2 was enhanced and associated with vascular oxidative stress in coronary arteries in metabolic syndrome.
