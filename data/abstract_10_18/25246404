The Carba NP test was evaluated against a panel of 61 carbapenemase-producing bacterial species (15 producing class A carbapenemases, 15 producing class D carbapenemases, and 31 producing metallo-beta-lactamases) and against 111 isolates with non-wild-type carbapenem susceptibility but not producing carbapenemase. Carbapenemase production was verified by PCR and UV-spectrophotometric measurement of imipenem hydrolysis. No false positives were seen, but there were consistent problems with the detection of OXA-48-like enzymes and also some rarer class A enzymes.
