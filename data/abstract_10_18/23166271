Multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa commonly causes serious nosocomial infections. In this study, a novel lytic bacteriophage belonging to a member of the family Podoviridae, YMC01/01/P52 PAE BP, which infects carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, was isolated and characterized. YMC01/01/P52 PAE BP genome was analyzed by whole-genome sequencing and putative function identification. The bacteriophage genome consists of a double-stranded linear DNA genome of 49,381 bp with a GC content of 62.16%.
