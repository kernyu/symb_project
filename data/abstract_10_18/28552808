Emergence of antibiotic resistance among pathogenic bacteria encourages us to search for new molecules as an alternative treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antiquorum sensing (anti-QS) and antibiofilm potential of Salvadora persica L. methanolic extracts to prevent the infections due to Staphylococcus as an alternate to antibiotics. The methanolic extracts of S. persica L. fruit, leaves and stems was assessed for their activity in inhibiting QS-depedent phenomenon such as violacein pigment production in Chromobacterium violaceum, swarming motility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and biofilm formation in oral Staphylococcus strains on polymethylmetacrylate (PMMA). Methanolic fruit extract of S. persica L. showed a high degree of anti-biofilm formation on PMMA and on violacein inhibition with a percentage of reduction equal to 90% when MIC value (20 mg/ml) was used. 100 mug/ml of S. persica L. leaves exhibited inhibition in swarming motility of PAO1 at 29.17%. Because the methanolic extracts of S. persica L. demonstrated anti-QS and antibiofilm activity at very low concentrations, it could be further exploited for novel molecules to treat oral Staphylococcus infections.
