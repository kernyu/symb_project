BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is one of the most significant causes of mortality and morbidity. Early diagnose is important especially in multiple drug resistant tuberculosis to avoid transmission. Traditional techniques requires at least one to three weeks for diagnosis of tuberculosis. Diagnostic delays with multiple drug resistant tuberculosis are associated with worse clinical outcomes and increased transmission The Xpert MTB/RIF assay is one of the new diagnostic device for the diagnosis of tuberculosis and rapid detection of rifampicin resistance. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the performance of Xpert MTB/RIF assay for detecting rifampicin resistance using phenotypic drug susceptibility tests as automated BD MGIT 960. METHODS: Total of 2136 specimens were included in the study. Xpert MTB/RIF testing was performed on samples, using version 4 cartridges, according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The MTBC culture and first-line phenotypic DST were performed in automated BD MGIT 960 (Becton & Dickinson, USA) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Agar proportion was used in the case of inconsistency for rifampicin resistance. FINDINGS: Thirty-four samples (19 respiratory and 15 nonrespiratory samples) were determined as positive for M. tuberculosis complex by Xpert MTB/RIF (Cepheid GeneXpert(R) System, USA). Xpert MTB/RIF assay detected 4/34 (11.7%) specimens as rifampicin resistant. One of the rifampicin resistant isolates was determined susceptible in MGIT 960 automated system. This isolate was also tested with agar proportion method and found susceptible to rifampicin. MAIN CONCLUSION: The Xpert MTB/RIF assay can be used as first-line assay for the detection of M. tuberculosis. However, microbiologists must be aware of the limitations of the assay.
