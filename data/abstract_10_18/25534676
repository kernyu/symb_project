OBJECTIVE: The study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) among patients with vaginitis, frequency of different Candida species, and their susceptibility profile. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Over six months period, high vaginal swabs were cultured on Sabouraud's dextrose agar and isolates were identified by culture on CHROMagar Candida and Vitek2 yeast identification system or/and API 20C (BioMerieux, France). Antifungal susceptibility of the Candida isolates was determined by E-test against amphotericin B, flucytosine, fluconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole and caspofungin. RESULTS: One thousand seven hundred and fifty-two women with vaginitis were screened for the prevalence of Candida spp. Vaginal swab cultures of 231 (13.2%) women yielded Candida spp. The isolation rates of different species were as follows: Candida albicans (73.9%), Candida glabrata (19.8%), Candida kefir (1.94%), Candida tropicalis (0.96%), Candida parapsilosis (0.96%), Candida krusei (0.96%), Candida guilliermondii (0.96%), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (0.52%). All strains of C. albicans and non-C. albicans were susceptible to most of the antifungal agents tested. CONCLUSION: The high frequency with which C. albicans was recovered and its azole susceptibility support the continued use of azole agents for empirical therapy of uncomplicated VVC. However, a larger controlled study is required to determine the role of non-C. albicans in recurrent VVC.
