In this study we report the analysis of 131 Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) clinical isolates from patients hospitalized in various wards, of Perugia General Hospital, from August 2014 to January 2015. Forty two isolates (32.1 %), were resistant to at least one carbapenem antibiotic and, among these isolates, 14 (33.3 %) exhibited resistance to colistin. All isolates were carbapenemases producers and 41 (97.6 %) harboured the bla KPC gene. Carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates (CRKPs) were, also, typed for the genotypic diversity and the results revealed the circulation of two major clusters.This surveillance study evidences the spread of CRKP isolates in Perugia General Hospital and confirms that carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates have reached epidemic dissemination in Italy. In addition the percentage of resistance to colistin resulted to be less than that observed in other hospital laboratories across Italy. In conclusion the circulation of these isolates should be monitored and appropriate policy of surveillance must be used, in a target manner, in order to reduce the spread of carbapenem-resistant isolates.
