A nisin-resistant Lactococcus lactis strain TML01 was isolated from crude milk. A gene with 99% homology to the nisin-resistance gene, nsr, was identified. The food-grade secretion plasmid, pLEB690 (3746 bp), was constructed based on this novel nsr gene enabling primary selection with up to 5 mug nisin/ml. The functionality of pLEB690 as a secretion vector was shown by expressing and secreting the pediocin AcH gene papA in L. lactis. pLEB690 is therefore, a functional food-grade secretion vector potentially useful for the food industry.
