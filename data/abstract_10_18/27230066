BACKGROUND: In West Africa, the carriage of Group B Streptococcus (GBS), among infants is poorly characterised. We investigated co-carriage of GBS with other respiratory pathogens in the infants' nasopharynx in The Gambia. METHODS: We assessed the carriage, serotypes and antibiotic susceptibility of Beta-haemolytic Streptococci (BHS) groups A-G; along with the carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae; Haemophilus influenzae; Staphylococcus aureus and Moraxella catarrhalis in 1200 two-month old infants. RESULTS: The BHS prevalence was 20.0 % and GBS dominated (13.8 %), particularly serotypes V and II; serotype V being negatively associated with H. Influenzae carriage (OR 0.41 [95 % CI: 0.18-0.93], p = 0.033). Although co-colonization of GBS and other BHS was not seen, colonization with GBS was positively associated with S. aureus (OR 1.89 [95 % CI: 1.33-2.69], P < 0.001) and negatively associated with S. pneumoniae (OR 0.47 [95 % CI: 0.33-0.67], p < 0.001) and M. catarrhalis (OR 0.61 [95 % CI: 0.40-0.92], p = 0.017). >/= 89 % of GBS isolates were susceptible to most antibiotics tested, except for tetracycline resistance, which was 89 %. CONCLUSION: This study provides baseline data on the carriage of GBS in two month old infants from West Africa. The dominant serotypes of GBS in this setting are serotypes V and II. This may be important for future GBS vaccine development for the West African sub-region.
