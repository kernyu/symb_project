The choice of perioperative antibiotics for head and neck oncologic surgery is the subject of significant controversy. Given the ever-increasing number of antibiotic options available, as well as the growing problem of antibiotic resistance, there is a need for renewed research on this important topic. In their recent publication, Langerman and colleagues explore the relationship between antibiotic choice, surgical site infections, and antibiotic-induced complications in patients undergoing total laryngectomy. They demonstrate wide variability in antibiotic regimens among patients undergoing total laryngectomy, as well as an association between increased risk of surgical site infections and clindamycin use. This study addresses a controversial subject affecting the daily care of patients with head and neck cancer, and the findings have the potential to significantly affect management. It also highlights the strengths and inherent limitations of an administrative data approach to head and neck cancer clinical research.
