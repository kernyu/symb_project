The multidrug resistance profiles of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) producers have led to increased clinical polymyxin use. Combination therapy with polymyxins may improve treatment outcomes, but it is uncertain which combinations are most effective. Clinical successes with intravenous minocycline-based combination treatments have been reported for infections caused by carbapenemase-producing bacteria. The objective of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of polymyxin B and minocycline combination therapy against six KPC-2-producing K. pneumoniae isolates (minocycline MIC range, 2 to 32 mg/liter). Polymyxin B monotherapy (0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 16 mg/liter) resulted in a rapid reduction of up to 6 log in bactericidal activity followed by regrowth by 24 h. Minocycline monotherapy (1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 mg/liter) showed no reduction of activity of >1.34 log against all isolates, although concentrations of 8 and 16 mg/liter prolonged the time to regrowth. When the therapies were used in combination, rapid bactericidal activity was followed by slower regrowth, with synergy (60 of 120 combinations at 24 h, 19 of 120 combinations at 48 h) and additivity (43 of 120 combinations at 24 h, 44 of 120 combinations at 48 h) against all isolates. The extent of killing was greatest against the more susceptible polymyxin B isolates (MICs of </=0.5 mg/liter) regardless of the minocycline MIC. The pharmacodynamic activity of combined polymyxin B-minocycline therapy against KPC-producing K. pneumoniae is dependent on polymyxin B susceptibility. Further in vitro and animal studies must be performed to fully evaluate the efficacy of this drug combination.
