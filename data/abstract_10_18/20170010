Between 1992 and 2007, a total of 86 isolates of Salmonella enterica Weltevreden were obtained from clinical human samples (n = 41), 45 farm animals and their environment on 20 farms, including poultry (n = 25), beef cattle (n = 5), swine (n = 5), dairy cattle (n = 3), mice (n = 2), pony (n = 1), fly (n = 1) and feed samples (n = 3), in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. Only seven isolates (8.1%) of the isolates were resistance to one or more antimicrobial agents tested; six streptomycin (7.0%), six oxytetracycline (7.0%), two ampicillin (2.3%), two kanamycin, (2.3%), two chloramphenicol (2.3%), two suffamethoxazole/trimethoprim (2.3%), whereas all isolates were susceptible to gentamicin, sefuroxime, colistin, nalidixic acid, fosfomycin and ofloxacin. Drug resistance patterns showed six patterns; ABPC-SM-KM-OTC-CP-ST, ABPC-SM-ST, SM-KM-OTC, SM-OTC-CP, SM-OTC, OTC. Two ampicillin-resistant isolates harbored the blaTEM genes, streptomycin-resistant isolates (four aadA, two strA), tetracycline-resistant isolates (two tetA, three tetB), chloramphenicol-resistant isolates (two catA1), respectively.
