CRF01_AE is a major subtype of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) circulating in Southeast Asia, including Thailand. We performed genotypic studies on HIV-1 CRF01_AE integrase derived from plasma samples from drug-naive Thai patients. Direct sequencing of amplified CRF01_AE integrase genes revealed that although no primary mutations associated with drug resistance to integrase inhibitors were detected, at least one secondary mutation was found in 96% of samples. Our results indicate that the impact of these mutations on the baseline drug susceptibility of CRF01_AE viruses to integrase inhibitors may need to be addressed prior to the introduction of these drugs in Southeast Asian countries, including Thailand.
