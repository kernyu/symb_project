Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is a common infection of the ocular surface. Increasing rates of bacterial resistance have prompted the development of new antibiotics with improved activity against the bacterial species most often found in this disease. Besifloxacin is the first topical chlorofluoroquinolone developed solely for ophthalmic use. Studies have attested to its in vitro potency against a broad range of bacteria, as well as its efficacy in clinical studies of bacterial conjunctivitis when dosed 2 or 3 times a day. This review provides an up-to-date summary of studies on causative pathogens in acute bacterial conjunctivitis; recent geographic trends in bacterial resistance among ocular pathogens, including that of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; the efficacy of besifloxacin in preclinical and clinical studies; its safety; and the role of besifloxacin in combating resistant strains. Further, this review provides a brief update on bacterial keratitis, causative pathogens, the development of resistance among those pathogens, and the potential role of besifloxacin in the treatment of bacterial keratitis.
