Ethiopia changed the first-line anti-malarial drug for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria from sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) to Coartem((R)) in 2004 following nation-wide assessment of the efficacy of both drugs in 2003. This study was conducted to assess the prevalence of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance-associated mutations in dhfr and dhps genes of P. falciparum three years after SP withdrawal in Bahir Dar, Northwest Ethiopia. A total of 165 blood spot samples were collected from patients infected with P. falciparum in Bahir Dar Health Center in 2005 (n=78) and 2008 (n=87) using Whatman (3M) filter papers. The three dhfr codons (dhfr108, dhfr 51 and dhfr 59) and the two dhps codons (dhfr 437 and 540) which are believed to determine SP resistance were detected by using nested PCR-based dot blot-hybridization technique. In dhfr, only the dhfr59Arg mutant-type showed statistically significant reduction from 80.3% in 2005 to 56.4% in 2008 (p<0.01) with a significant increase of the wild type dhfr59Cys haplotypes from 4.9% in 2005 to 29.5% in 2008 (p<0.01). The double mutants dhfr108Asn/51Ile were detected at rate of 98.4% in 2005 and 98.7% in 2008. A significant decrease in the triple dhfr (108Asn/51Ile/59Arg) mutation was observed from 2005 (78.6%) to 2008(56.4%) (p<0.01). The quadruple mutations of dhfr (108Asn/51Ile/59Arg)/dhps437Gly were significantly declined from 78.6% in 2005 to 53.8% in 2008 (p<0.01) while quintuple mutations (dhfr (108Asn/51Ile/59Arg)/dhps437Gly/dhps540Glu) showed a reduction from 60.6% to 37.2% after three years (p<0.01). In conclusion, the decline in the prevalence of dhfr/dhps combination mutations might indicate the re-emergence of sensitive parasites in the population following SP withdrawal. Therefore, further monitoring and assessment is important to determine the feasibility of re-introduction of SP alone or in combination as a more affordable and safer drug in the future in Ethiopia.
