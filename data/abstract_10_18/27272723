OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to evaluate the pharmacodynamics of doripenem, imipenem and meropenem as a predictor of clinical success, mortality, 28 day recurrence and development of resistance in patients treated for Pseudomonas aeruginosa ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Previously published demographic and outcome data derived from patients treated for P. aeruginosa VAP with doripenem, imipenem or meropenem were utilized. Patient-specific data were used in conjunction with published population pharmacokinetic models to construct concentration-time profiles for each patient. Etest MICs were used to determine pharmacodynamic profiles. Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was utilized to partition pharmacodynamics based on outcomes with P values of 0.05. RESULTS: Eighty-six patients were included in the analysis. Initial carbapenem MICs ranged from 0.03 to 32 mg/L. VAP recurred in 28 patients; of these, 17 patients were initially infected with susceptible organisms, and 14 of them developed resistance. CART fT>MIC partitions identified for clinical success and survival were 19.2% (P = 0.016) and 47.9% (P < 0.001), respectively. No statistically significant partitions for fT>MIC were identified for recurrence or resistance development. CONCLUSIONS: We identified fT>MIC cut-offs for positive clinical outcomes in patients with P. aeruginosa VAP that were similar to those observed in animal models of infection for stasis ( approximately 20%) and 1 log decreases in cfu ( approximately 40%). Although in vitro studies have suggested a link between drug exposure and development of resistance, we were unable to identify such a relationship clinically.
