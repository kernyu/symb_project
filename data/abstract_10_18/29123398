The use of nanoparticles may be particularly advantageous in treating bacterial infections due to their multiple simultaneous mechanisms of action. Nanoencapsulation is particularly useful for lipophilic drugs. In this scenario, triclosan is considered a good candidate due to its lipophilicity, broad-spectrum activity, and safety. In the present study, we have developed and characterized an antimicrobial suspension of triclosan and alpha-bisabolol against pathogenic strains that are resistant (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and susceptible (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans) to triclosan. We also aimed to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration, using serial microdilution adapted from a CLSI methodology (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute). Challenge test was used to confirm the antimicrobial effectiveness of the nanocapsule formulation, as well as after its incorporation into a commercial wound dressing (Veloderm((R))). The zeta potential of P. aeruginosa before and after contact with cationic nanocapsules and the ratio between the number of nanocapsules per colony forming unit (CFU) were determined to evaluate a possible interaction between nanocapsules and bacteria. The results showed that nanoencapsulation has improved the antimicrobial activity when tested with two different methodologies. The number of nanocapsules per CFU was high even in great dilutions and the zeta potential was reverted after being in contact with the cationic nanocapsules. The nanocapsules were able to improve the activity of triclosan, even when tested within 28 days and when dried in the wound dressing.
