OBJECTIVES: The pandemic spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria poses a threat to healthcare worldwide, with highest prevalence in indigent regions of the (sub)tropics. As hospitalization constitutes a major risk factor for colonization, infection control management in low-prevalence countries urgently needs background data on patients hospitalized abroad. METHODS: We collected data on 1122 patients who, after hospitalization abroad, were treated at the Helsinki University Hospital between 2010 and 2013. They were screened for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE), vancomycin-resistant enterococci, carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE), multiresistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and multiresistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Risk factors for colonization were explored by multivariate analysis. RESULTS: MDR colonization rates were higher for those hospitalized in the (sub)tropics (55%; 208/377) compared with temperate zones (17%; 125/745). For ESBL-PE the percentages were 50% (190/377) versus 12% (92/745), CPE 3.2% (12/377) versus 0.4% (3/745) and MRSA 6.6% (25/377) versus 2.4% (18/745). Colonization rates proved highest in those returning from South Asia (77.6%; 38/49), followed by those having visited Latin America (60%; 9/16), Africa (60%; 15/25) and East and Southeast Asia (52.5%; 94/179). Destination, interhospital transfer, short time interval to hospitalization, young age, surgical intervention, residence abroad, visiting friends and relatives, and antimicrobial use proved independent risk factors for colonization. CONCLUSIONS: Post-hospitalization colonization rates proved higher in the (sub)tropics than elsewhere; 11% (38/333) of carriers developed an MDR infection. We identified several independent risk factors for contracting MDR bacteria. The data provide a basis for infection control guidelines in low-prevalence countries.
