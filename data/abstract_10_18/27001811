Dalbavancin, a novel lipoglycopeptide, was approved for use in 2014 by regulatory agencies in the United States and Europe for the treatment of skin and skin structure infections. The activity of dalbavancin was also widely assessed by determination of its activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae clinical isolates collected from patients on six continents monitored during two time intervals (2011 to 2013 and 2014). A total of 18,186 pneumococcal isolates were obtained from 49 nations and submitted to a monitoring laboratory as part of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program for reference susceptibility testing. The potency of dalbavancin against S. pneumoniae was consistent across the years that it was monitored, with the MIC50 and MIC90 being 0.015 and 0.03 mug/ml, respectively, and all isolates were inhibited by </=0.12 mug/ml. The activity of dalbavancin was not adversely influenced by nonsusceptibility to beta-lactams (ceftriaxone or penicillin), macrolides, clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, or tetracyclines or multidrug resistance (MDR). Regional variations in dalbavancin activity were not detected, but S. pneumoniae strains isolated in the Asia-Pacific region were more likely to be nonsusceptible to penicillin and ceftriaxone as well as to be MDR than strains isolated in North or South America and Europe. Direct comparisons of potency illustrated that dalbavancin (MIC50 and MIC90, 0.015 and 0.03 mug/ml, respectively) was 16-fold or more active than vancomycin (MIC50, 0.25 mug/ml), linezolid (MIC50, 1 mug/ml), levofloxacin (MIC50, 1 mug/ml), ceftriaxone (MIC90, 1 mug/ml), and penicillin (MIC90, 2 mug/ml). In conclusion, dalbavancin had potent and consistent activity against this contemporary (2011 to 2014) collection of S. pneumoniae isolates.
