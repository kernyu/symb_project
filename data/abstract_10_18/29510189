We evaluated meropenem-vaborbactam activity against 11,559 Enterobacteriaceae isolates, including 330 carbapenem-resistant phenotypes (CRE) and carbapenemase genotypes collected worldwide during 2015. Meropenem-vaborbactam (inhibitor at 8 mg/L) and comparators were susceptibility tested using reference broth microdilution methods. CRE isolates were screened for the presence of genes encoding carbapenemases and 292 (88.5%) of the CRE isolates carried these resistance genes. A total of 209 (63.3% of the CRE; 1.8% of the overall Enterobacteriaceae population) isolates carried blaKPC, including genes encoding KPC-2 (90 isolates), KPC-3 (117), and KPC-17 (2). Overall, meropenem-vaborbactam (vaborbactam at 8 mg/L) inhibited 99.3% of all Enterobacteriaceae isolates at the FDA susceptibility breakpoint of </=4/8 mg/L. Meropenem alone inhibited 96.9% of the isolates at the current CLSI susceptibility breakpoint of </=2 mg/L. Susceptibility rates for comparator antimicrobial agents tested against Enterobacteriaceae isolates ranged from 82.1% to 98.2% applying the CLSI breakpoints. Against CRE isolates, meropenem-vaborbactam displayed MIC50/90 values at 0.5/32 mg/L, whereas meropenem MIC50/90 values were 16/>32 mg/L. Meropenem-vaborbactam was very active against KPC-producers, and 99.5% of isolates were inhibited by </=4/8 mg/L. The single resistant isolate was shown to harbour a porin protein alteration. Meropenem-vaborbactam had limited activity against MBL-producing isolates that included 49 NDM, 1 IMP-64, and 2 VIM-producers) and/or oxacillinases (47 OXA-48/-232) that were detected mainly in European countries. Meropenem-vaborbactam was active against contemporary CRE and wild-type Enterobacteriaceae collected worldwide, and this combination demonstrated enhanced activity when compared to meropenem and most comparator agents against CRE and KPC-producers.
