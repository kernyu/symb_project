To assess the impact of intervention on antibiotic misuse in children, parents' and pediatricians' knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) concerning antibiotic use were evaluated pre- and postintervention in Larnaca (Cyprus) and Limassol (Cyprus). Concurrently, pediatricians documented upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) visits and pharmacists provided antibiotic consumption data. Intervention was implemented for parents and pediatricians residing in Larnaca. The consumption/URTI incidence index was significantly reduced in Larnaca but not in Limassol. Parental responses to a KAP questionnaire remained unchanged; therefore, antibiotic consumption reduction is attributable to pediatricians' education.
