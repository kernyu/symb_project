This study aimed to retrospectively identify 22Streptococcus bovis clinical strains based on the new taxonomy, as well as to investigate their antibiotic-resistance and clonality. Strains were identified by Phoenix100 system, 16S rRNA sequencing, and two MALDI-TOF MS platforms (Bruker Biotyper, Vitek MS). Antibiotic resistance was determined both phenotypically and genotypically, and clonality was assessed by PFGE. Most of strains (63.6%) were isolated from urine, and diabetes was the most common underlying disease (31.8%). Phoenix100 system revealed all strains belonged to biotype II, and 16S rRNA sequencing identified all strains as S. gallolyticus subsp pasteurianus (SGSP). Although both MALDI-TOF MS systems correctly identified isolates to the species level, only Bruker Biotyper accurately identified to the subspecies level. Erythromycin-resistant strains (31.8%) were also clindamycin-resistant and positive for erm(B). Strains resistant to tetracycline (68.2%) were also resistant to erythromycin. PFGE showed high genetic variability identifying 17 different pulsotypes, most of which single.
