We describe the first isolation of an NDM-1-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Italy. In May 2013, a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and history of prior hospitalisation in Belgrad, Serbia, underwent stem cell transplantation at a tertiary care hospital in Rome, Italy. After transplantion, sepsis by NDM-1-producing P. aeruginosa occurred, leading to septic shock and fatal outcome.
