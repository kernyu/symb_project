Two genetically related Klebsiella pneumoniae strains carrying OXA-type carbapenemases were isolated from a single patient 1 month apart. Kpn163 harboured OXA-163 and Kpn247 a new variant named OXA-247 that showed susceptibility to carbapenems and expanded-spectrum cephalosporins similar to OXA-48. Our epidemiological, biochemical and molecular results suggest the intrapatient emergence of blaOXA -247 from blaOXA -163.
