Treatment failures in patients suffering from giardiasis are not uncommon feature. The most frequent approach in these cases is to treat these patients with longer repeated courses and/or higher doses of the primary therapy, or using drugs from a different class to avoid potential cross-resistance. However, a higher rate of adverse events may limit this strategy. In this context, combination therapy (CT) is emerging as a valuable option against refractory giardiasis. In the attempt to evaluate the benefits of CT, a number of experimental studies, clinical series, and randomized clinical trials (RCTs), as well as several veterinary studies have been performed, with varying results. Here, we present a critical analysis of the available information regarding CT for the treatment of Giardia infection, as well as the authors' opinion with respect to its use. RCTs of combination therapy are limited and the optimal combinations and administration strategies need yet to be clarified. Analyses of the cost-effectiveness and RCTs of CTs for Giardia infection are required to assess the role of these drugs for the control of giardiasis, mainly in the case of treatment failures linked to suspected drug tolerance are the case.
