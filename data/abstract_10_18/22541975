Gram-positive infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in oncohematological patients and transplant recipients. The most frequently isolated Gram-positive organisms are the coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp., and viridans group streptococci. Antibiotic resistance in these organisms is increasing and poses a challenge to clinicians. Daptomycin is rapidly bactericidal against a broad spectrum of gram-positive bacteria, including strains resistant to other drugs. The present article reviews some aspects of Gram-positive infections in these immunocompromised patients and provides a detailed analysis of experience with daptomycin in the treatment of these infections.
