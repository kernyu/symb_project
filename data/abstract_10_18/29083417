Wnt (wingless)/beta-catenin signaling is critical for tumor progression and is frequently activated in colorectal cancer as a result of the mutation of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC); however, therapeutic agents targeting this pathway for clinical use are lacking. Here we report that nitazoxanide (NTZ), a clinically approved antiparasitic drug, efficiently inhibits Wnt signaling independent of APC. Using chemoproteomic approaches, we have identified peptidyl arginine deiminase 2 (PAD2) as the functional target of NTZ in Wnt inhibition. By targeting PAD2, NTZ increased the deamination (citrullination) and turnover of beta-catenin in colon cancer cells. Replacement of arginine residues disrupted the transcriptional activity, and NTZ induced degradation of beta-catenin. In Wnt-activated colon cancer cells, knockout of either PAD2 or beta-catenin substantially increased resistance to NTZ treatment. Our data highlight the potential of NTZ as a modulator of beta-catenin citrullination for the treatment of cancer patients with Wnt pathway mutations.
