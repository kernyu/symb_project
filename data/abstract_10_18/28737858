INTRODUCTION: The aim of this prospective single-center study was to determine the changings in incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), serotype distribution and the antimicrobial resistance patterns of S. pneumoniae in children with IPD after the period (1 to 7 years) of vaccination with PCV7 (2008) and PCV13 (2011). POPULATION AND METHODS: The study was conducted on 39 Turkish children with IPD between ages 1 month and 18 years in Ankara, Turkey. Streptococcus pneumoniae was identified using standard laboratory procedures from blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), pleural fluid, and other sterile body fluids and tissues. S. pneumoniae isolates were tested for resistance to penicilin and ceftriaxone using the E-test methodology. Serotypes of the isolates were determined by Quellung reaction. RESULTS: The overall annual incidence rate of IPD decreased significantly from 7.71 (95% CI, 1.99-13.4) to 1.58 (95% CI, 0.6-3.77; RRR=-79.5; p=0.006) per 100 000 population among </=5 years of age without underlying disease. During the overall study period, the PCV7-serotypes and PCV13-serotypes represented 27.8% and 63.8% of isolates, respectively. PCV13-serotypes made up 81.8% of cases of IPD in the pre-PCV13 era and decreased to 56% in the 4 years after PCV13. The penicillin and ceftriaxone (for meningitis) resistance rates were 48.5% and 9.1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study about the changing pattern of the incidence of IPD in Turkish children after the implementation of the PCV7 and PCV13 in Turkish national vaccine schedule and a prominent decrease in incidence of IPD has seen after the implementation of PCV13.
