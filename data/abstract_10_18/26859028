BACKGROUND: The efficacy of anti-retroviral Therapy (ART) depends on adherence to the prescribed regimen. However, lack of adherence leads to treatment failure and drug resistance among other negative outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To determine factors influencing adherence to ARVS among patients attending the Comprehensive Care Clinic (CCC) within Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT). DESIGN: A descriptive cross sectional study. SETTING: Comprehensive Care Clinic within JKUAT. SUBJECTS: Three hundred HIV positive patients, undergoing ART treatment and follow up at the JKUAT clinic for a minimum duration of one month before the study, were recruited. RESULTS: Of the 300 patients enrolled for the study (70% females and 30% males), 81% were adhering to ARV treatment. The factors that were significantly associated with adherence included; Support (encouragement and reminder to take drugs) (P = 0.025); the number of meals respondents took in a day (P = 0.001); pill burden (P = 0.002) and forgetfulness (P = 0.001). However, there was no significant relationship between adherence and age, marital status, education, employment status or time taken to travel to the clinic. CONCLUSION: This study concluded that, the observed level of sub-optimal adherence to ART (19%) is of public health concern. These patients are vulnerable to treatment failure and development of resistant viral strains. Consequently the modifiable factors (Support, Number of meals taken, pill burden, and forgetfulness, should be addressed to change the current tread.
