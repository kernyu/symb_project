A carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli isolate was recovered from rectal swab of a 12-day-old female neonate, which was admitted to a Greek neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Phenotypic testing, polymerase chain reaction assays with sequencing, and plasmid analysis revealed that the isolate harbored a plasmid-mediated bla(VIM-1) metallo-beta-lactamase gene. The appearance of a metallo-beta-lactamase-producing E. coli in NICU is worrisome. Further surveys are needed to determine whether such Enterobacteriaceae may also be spreading in other NICUs.
