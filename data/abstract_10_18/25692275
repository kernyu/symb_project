PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review presents an update on recent findings relating to the prevention, control and epidemiology of infections following orthopaedic surgery. RECENT FINDINGS: Trends in population rates and characteristics of patients undergoing hip and knee replacement surgery, coupled with the reported excess infection risk in obese patients, emphasize the current and future impact of increasing population obesity on healthcare delivery. SUMMARY: Prevention of orthopaedic infection is dependent on elimination or optimal management of documented risk factors. Guidelines and quality standards play a key role in translating this evidence base into a framework of practices for the prevention of surgical site infections. Increasing levels of orthopaedic infection due to Enterobacteriaceae, coupled with an increasingly obese surgical population may necessitate a reassessment of antimicrobial prophylaxis strategies.
