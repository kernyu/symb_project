The impact of an efflux pump-related interaction between ivermectin and danofloxacin on their intestinal transport (ex vivo) and disposition kinetics (in vivo) was assessed. Eighteen male Corriedale sheep were randomly assigned to one of three groups. Animals in Group A received 0.2mg/kg ivermectin by SC injection, those in Group B were given 6 mg/kg danofloxacin SC on two occasions 48 h apart and those in Group C were treated with both compounds at the same rates. Plasma concentrations of ivermectin and danofloxacin were measured by HPLC using fluorescence detection. Ex vivo intestinal drug transport activity was measured by the use of the Ussing chamber technique. Plasma concentrations of ivermectin in the first 6 days after injection tended to be higher in Group C than Group A. Contemporaneous treatment with ivermectin significantly increased systemic exposure to danofloxacin (AUC values were 32-35% higher) and prolonged the elimination half-life of danofloxacin (40-52% longer). Ex vivo, incubation with ivermectin significantly decreased the efflux transport of rhodamine 123, a P-glycoprotein substrate, in sheep intestine, but no significant effect of danofloxacin on transport activity was observed. Evaluation of the interaction of danofloxacin with the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) showed that pantoprazole and ivermectin significantly decreased danofloxacin secretion in the rat intestine. Thus, the ivermectin-induced reduction of danofloxacin efflux transport observed in this study may involve BCRP activity but the involvement of P-glycoprotein cannot be ruled out.
