A marine-derived Streptomyces sp. (CMB-M0244) isolated from a sediment collected off South Molle Island, Queensland, produced mollemycin A (1) as a new first in class glyco-hexadepsipeptide-polyketide. The structure of 1 was assigned by detailed spectroscopic analysis, supported by chemical derivatization and degradation, and C3 Marfey's analysis. Mollemycin A (1) exhibits exceptionally potent and selective growth inhibitory activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (IC50 10-50 nM) and drug-sensitive (3D7; IC50 7 nM) and multidrug-resistant (Dd2; IC50 9 nM) clones of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum.
