Studies of the reaction of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MMSCs) derived from human adipose tissue to oxidative stress showed that cells cultivated at 5% O2 possessed much lower resistance to hydrogen peroxide. This could be consequent to low basal activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GP) in these cells when compared to MMSCs exposed to 20 % 02 and 1% O2. Twenty-four-hour exposure of stromal precursors in a medium containing H2O2 in a minimal concentration (LD5) stimulated an oxygen-dependent rise of the SOD activity, whereas catalase and GP concentrations did not change. Activation of the antioxidant system in response to equally a weak hypoxic (1% O2) and weak hyperoxic (20% O2) stress in vitro enhances the MMSCs resistance to H2O2.
