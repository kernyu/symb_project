In the Danish husbandry antimicrobial growth promoters were phased out 1994-2000 and the therapeutic use has been increasingly regulated. Hitherto, a minimum in therapeutic use was reached in 1997. The antimicrobial use in pigs increased by 44% during 2002-2009; a 12% decrease in second half of 2010 was likely due to the announcement of the "yellow card" regulation. From July 2010, a voluntary two years stop of cephalosporins use in pigs was realized, due to increasing occurrence of extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) resistance in animal and meat isolates; highest levels of ESBL are observed in imported poultry.
