Human-associated microorganisms have the potential to biosynthesize numerous secondary metabolites that may mediate important host-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions. However, there is currently a limited understanding of microbiome-derived natural products. A variety of complementary discovery approaches have begun to illuminate this microbial "dark matter," which will in turn allow detailed mechanistic studies of the effects of these molecules on microbiome and host. Herein, we review recent efforts to uncover microbiome-derived natural products, describe the key approaches that were used to identify and characterize these metabolites, discuss potential functional roles of these molecules, and highlight challenges related to this emerging research area.
