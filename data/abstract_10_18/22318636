A total of 35 Trichosporon isolates were collected from the Taiwan Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance of Yeasts (TSARY) project from 1999 to 2006, and their identifications as well as drug susceptibilities were determined. The most frequently isolated species was T. asahii (62.9%), and the most common clinical sample that yielded Trichosporon isolates was urine (37.1%). The etiology of all seven invasive trichosporonosis was T. asahii. For the 22 T. asahii isolates, the MIC(50) and MIC(90) for amphotericin B were 0.25 and 1 mug/mL, respectively. Those for fluconazole were 2 and 4 mug/mL, respectively, and for voriconazole 0.031 and 0.063 mug/mL, respectively. When the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and agreements were calculated, we found that the MICs of fluconazole obtained from different methods were similar and the inter-method discrepancies were low. Nevertheless, no unanimous MIC of amphotericin B and voriconazole was obtained among different methods.
