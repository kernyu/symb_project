We highlight the detection of a rare vanM genotype in Enterococcus faecium. This isolate exhibited a VanB phenotype, with high levels of resistance to vancomycin (MIC, >256 mg/liter) and susceptibility to teicoplanin (MIC, 1 mg/liter). It was, however, vanB negative by PCR. Further screening for other van loci revealed the presence of a complete vanM operon.
