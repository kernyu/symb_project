Pneumonia exhibits a broad range of severity, from mildly symptomatic at one end to fulminant septic shock and death at the other. Although an adequate inflammatory response is necessary for the clearance of microorganisms, excessive inflammation can lead to ongoing local and systemic damage. Because of this extended inflammatory response despite appropriate antibiotic therapy, as well as increasing antibiotic resistance, adjuvant therapy for pneumonia that can favourably modify the immune response has become an increasingly relevant approach to improve prognosis. Different adjuvant treatment options for pneumonia have recently been proposed. Promising treatment options include corticosteroids, statins, macrolides and Toll-like receptor antagonists. The aim of this review is to summarize the inflammatory response during pneumonia and discuss the current knowledge and future perspectives regarding the anti-inflammatory treatment options for patients with pneumonia.
