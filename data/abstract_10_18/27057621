CONTEXT: Co-administration of amodiaquine with MAMA decoction (MD), an herbal antimalarial drug comprising the leaves of Mangifera indica L. (Anacardiaceae), Alstonia boonei De Wild (Apocynaceae), Morinda lucida Benth (Rubiaceae) and Azadirachta indica A. Juss (Meliaceae) was investigated. The practice of concurrent administration of herbal medicines with orthodox drugs is currently on the increase globally. OBJECTIVE: The study was designed to investigate the possible enhancement of the antimalarial potency as well as possible herb-drug interaction resulting from concurrent administration of MAMA decoction with amodiaquine (AQ). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Combinations of MD with AQ were investigated in chloroquine (CQ)-sensitive Plasmodium berghei NK 65 in varying oral doses (mg/kg) at: sub-therapeutic [MD30 + AQ1.25], therapeutic [MD120 + AQ10] and median effective [MD40 + AQ3.8], using chemosuppressive and curative antimalarial test models. Secondly, P. berghei ANKA (CQ-resistant)-infected mice were orally treated with MD 120, 240, [MD120 + AQ10] and [MD240 + AQ10] mg/kg, using both models. The survival times of mice were monitored for 28 d. RESULTS: ED50 values of MD and AQ were 48.8 and 4.1 mg/kg, respectively. A total parasite clearance of CQ-sensitive P. berghei NK65 was obtained with the therapeutic combination dose in the curative test giving an enhanced survival time. In CQ-resistant P. berghei ANKA-infected mice, [MD120 + AQ10] and [MD240 + AQ10] mg/kg gave comparable activities with AQ (10 mg/kg) in both models. CONCLUSION: The therapeutic combination dose gave total parasite clearance of CQ-sensitive P. berghei NK65, whereas none of the doses tested showed notable activity against CQ-resistant P. berghei ANKA.
