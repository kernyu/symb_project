From January to December 2011, 24 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains producing the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase SHV-2a were identified in 13 hospitals in France. With one exception, all the strains belonged to the same clone. Double-disk synergy tests with cefepime and clavulanate were able to detect all the SHV-2a-positive isolates.
