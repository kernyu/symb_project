Education, surveillance, and promotion of antimicrobial stewardship align with the goals of public health to prevent disease, promote health, and prolong life. Many US federal and state public health organizations are already engaged in antimicrobial stewardship activities. Healthcare providers are encouraged to work with public health officials on appropriate local antimicrobial stewardship strategies to attain the common goal of reducing antimicrobial resistance and preserving antimicrobials for future generations.
