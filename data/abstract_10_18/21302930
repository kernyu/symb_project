A novel series of fully synthetic 8-azatetracyclines was prepared and evaluated for antibacterial activity. Compounds were identified that overcome both efflux (tet(K)) and ribosomal protection (tet(M)) tetracycline resistance mechanisms and are active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. Two compounds were identified that exhibit comparable efficacy to marketed tetracyclines in in vivo models of bacterial infection.
