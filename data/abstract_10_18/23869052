OBJECTIVES: To establish the species distribution and in vitro susceptibilities of 358 bloodstream fungal isolates from paediatric patients in Mexico. METHODS: Isolates were collected during a 2 year surveillance programme in 14 medical centres in 10 Mexican states. A molecular approach was used to determine the Candida parapsilosis species complex. In vitro susceptibility to amphotericin B, fluconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, caspofungin, anidulafungin and micafungin was determined according to CLSI procedures. Species-specific clinical breakpoints for fluconazole, voriconazole and echinocandins were applied. RESULTS: Candida spp. accounted for 98.33% of fungaemias, including 127 Candida albicans isolates, 127 C. parapsilosis complex isolates (121 C. parapsilosis sensu stricto, 4 Candida orthopsilosis and 2 Candida metapsilosis strains) and 72 Candida tropicalis isolates. C. albicans and C. parapsilosis complex were the species predominant in neonates (48 cases each; 41.02%). C. parapsilosis complex was also the predominant species in patients 1 month to <2 years of age (P = 0.007). In contrast, C. albicans was the most frequent species in patients aged 2 to <12 years (P = 0.003). Antifungal resistance was rare among the subset of isolates. Candida glabrata showed the highest resistance rate to amphotericin B (1/9 isolates), fluconazole (1/9 isolates) and itraconazole (2/9 isolates). CONCLUSIONS: The species distribution differed with the age of the patients, with C. albicans and C. parapsilosis complex being the most commonly isolated species. C. glabrata showed the highest resistance rate to amphotericin B, fluconazole and itraconazole. This is the first study of fungaemia episodes in Mexican children.
