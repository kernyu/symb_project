Owing to development of next generation sequencer (NGS), deep biological insights of breast cancer have been provided. Information of genomic mutations and rearrangements in patients' tumors is required to understand the mechanism in resistance of molecular targeted medicine. To date, NGS analyses illustrated not only base substitution patterns and lists of driver mutations and key rearrangements, but also a manner of tumor evolution. Breast cancer genome is dynamically changing and evolving during cancer development course and treatment procedures. Liquid biopsy is a non-invasive method to detect the genomic evolution of breast cancer, which is now under development for future application to clinical practice of cancer treatment. In this article, latest knowledge regarding breast cancer genome, especially in terms of 'evolution', is summarized.
