Management of community-acquired pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) can be complicated by emerging antimicrobial non-susceptibility. We conducted a meta-analysis to examine the antibiotic susceptibility of community-acquired invasive infections with S. pneumoniae and Hib in Africa from 1978 to 2011. With the notable exceptions of widespread trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT) and tetracycline non-susceptibility, the majority of pneumococci remain susceptible to ampicillin/amoxicillin. However, 23.8% of pneumococcal meningitis isolates are non-susceptible to penicillin. Similarly, Hib isolates show non-susceptibility to SXT, tetracycline, erythromycin and chloramphenicol. beta-Lactamase production among Hib isolates is increasing, a new observation for Africa, but is mitigated somewhat by Hib vaccination scale-up. In summary, pneumococcal susceptibility to amoxicillin remains high throughout Africa, and amoxicillin can be effectively and safely used as first-line treatment for childhood pneumonia. Data support first-line treatment of bacterial meningitis with ceftriaxone or cefotaxime.
