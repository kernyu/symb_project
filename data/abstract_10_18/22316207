INTRODUCTION: There are two classes of anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) agents currently in development: direct-acting antivirals (DAA) and host-targeting antivirals (HTA). Cyclophilin inhibitor alisporivir (ALV) , previously known as Debio-025 is the most advanced HTA in development. AREAS COVERED: Experimental and clinical studies demonstrated that ALV has high genetic barrier and no cross-resistance to DAA. Pharmacokinetic studies showed a profile suitable for once-daily administration. Phase I and II studies confirmed strong HCV suppression and that addition of ALV to pegylated IFNalpha (PegIFNalpha) and ribavirin (RBV) can improve their efficacy significantly. ALV was well tolerated and prevalence of the most frequent clinical and laboratory adverse events was similar to PegIFNalpha/RBV. Hyperbilirubinemia was the only significant adverse event related to ALV, but it was transient, reversible and not associated with hepatotoxicity or cholestasis. EXPERT OPINION: ALV is pangenotypic, with once-daily administration and safe, therefore medication can be easy and flexible. There is still a need of data in difficult-to-treat populations and genetic studies allowing selection of possible non-responders. Registration of ALV for IFN-based treatment is expected within 3 years, but ALV is also a good candidate for IFN-sparing combinations with DAA.
