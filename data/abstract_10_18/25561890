Antibiotic resistance is a problem of deep scientific concern both in hospital and community settings. Rapid detection in clinical laboratories is essential for the judicious recognition of antimicrobial resistant organisms. Production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) is a significant resistance-mechanism that impedes the antimicrobial treatment of infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae and is a serious threat to the currently available antibiotic armory. ESBLs are classified into several groups according to their amino acid sequence homology. Proper infection control practices and barriers are essential to prevent spread and outbreaks of ESBL producing bacteria. As bacteria have developed different strategies to counter the effects of antibiotics, the identification of the resistance mechanism may help in the discovery and design of new antimicrobial agents. The carbapenems are widely regarded as the drugs of choice for the treatment of severe infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, although comparative clinical trials are scarce. Hence, more expeditious diagnostic testing of ESBL-producing bacteria and the feasible modification of guidelines for community-onset bacteremia associated with different infections are prescribed.
