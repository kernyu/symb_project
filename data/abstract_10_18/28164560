BACKGROUND: The primary aim of this study is to measure the JAK-STAT signaling in HBV infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) stimulated by IFN-alpha and 3-TC and explore the influence of HBV to the JAKSTAT signaling pathways. METHODS: PBMCs were separated from healthy volunteers and patients who had not received any treatment with chronic hepatitis B. PBMCs were divided into the control group, IFN-alpha stimulation group, Lamivudine stimulation group, and combined treatment group. The expression of molecules of JAK-STAT signal transduction pathway (STAT1, STAT2, IRF9) and the antiviral protein (MxA) were detected by RT-qPCR and Western blot method. RESULTS: The majority of IFN-alpha inducible genes were expressed. The molecules of JAK-STAT signal transduction pathway (STAT1, STAT2, IRF9) and the antiviral protein (MxA) were highly expressed in IFN-alpha stimulation group and the combined treatment group. Compared to healthy controls, the expression levels of molecules (STAT1, IRF9) and the antiviral protein (MxA) are significantly lower in the control group, IFN-alpha stimulation group, and the combined treatment group of the CHB patients. CONCLUSIONS: IFN-alpha could activate JAK-STAT signaling transduction pathway in PBMCs of HBV-infected patients and HBV might process the activity to antagonize the antiviral activity in HBV infected PBMCs.
