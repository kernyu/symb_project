Due to drug-resistance phenomenon, there is a constant need for discovering new antiinfectious agents. A series of cinnamic acid derivatives was synthesized and then brominated with bromine in the presence of chloroform or acetic acid. The structure of the new compounds was confirmed by elemental and spectral data. Their antimicrobial activity was tested by disc-diffusion method. The tested compounds had mainly antifungal activity and were moderately active against Gram-positive bacteria. Bromination of the double bond determined the enhancement of the antimicrobial activity for all the tested compounds.
