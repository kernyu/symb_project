BACKGROUND: Decreased antiretroviral therapy persistence is associated with increased rates of virologic failure, development of antiretroviral resistance, and increased morbidity and mortality. Different therapeutic strategies, such as single-tablet regimens (STR) and less-drug regimens (LDR), have been developed in order to simplify antiretroviral therapy (ART) and increase persistence. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to compare antiretroviral persistence among patients receiving STRs and patients receiving LDRs. A secondary objective was to identify factors associated with non-persistence. METHODS: This was a retrospective study that included treatment- experienced HIV-infected patients who received ART based on STR or LDR. Baseline patient characteristics collected included demographic information, HIV risk transmission, substance abuse during the therapy, presence of psychiatric disorder and hepatitis B or C virus infection. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Log rank was utilized to compare persistence to STR and LDR. To identify independent predictors of non-persistence we developed a multivariate Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 244 patients were included, 176 with STR and 68 with LDR. 60 (34.1%) patients discontinued in the STR group and 13 (19.1%) in the LDR group. The Cox regression model showed that the only variable associated with higher risk of non-persistence was the substance abuse (HR = 2.59; p = 0.005). Adverse events were the main reason for ART discontinuation in the STR group and virologic failure in the LDR group. CONCLUSIONS: Persistence to STR and LDR seems to be similar in pretreated HIV-infected patients. Drug abuse was the only factor identified with a higher risk of non-persistence.
