OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pathologic bacterial distribution and their antibiotic resistance in infants aged from 1 to 3 months with lower respiratory tract infection, so as to provide instructions for clinical application of antibiotics. METHODS: Induced sputum was extracted from 622 cases of hospitalized infants aged from 1 to 3 months with lower respiratory tract infection between January 2013 and December 2013, and microbial sensitivity test was performed with agar diffusion sensitivity test. RESULTS: A total of 379 (60.9%) strains of bacteria were isolated from induced sputum in the 622 infants. The Gram-negative strains were detected in 325 strains (85.8%), and the Gram-positive strains were found in 50 strains (13.2%) in the 379 strains. The others were Fungal strains (4 strains, 1.1%). The Gram-negative bacteria included Escherichia coli (31.1%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (18.2%), with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) production of 48.3% and 52.2% respectively. The average rate of antibiotic resistance for ESBLs-producing bacteria was 53%. ESBLs-producing bacteria were highly resistant (100%) to ampicillin and cefotaxime, but sensitive to carbapenems. Staphylococcus aureus (10.0%) was the dominant bacteria in Gram-positive bacteria. A lower proportion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (1.8%) was observed, however the resistance rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus to beta-lactam antibiotics were 100%. CONCLUSIONS: Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae are the main pathogenic bacteria causing lower respiratory tract infection in infants aged from 1 to 3 months. ESBLs-producing bacteria accounted for over 48%, and the antibiotic resistance rate were more than 53% in these infants. These results provide a basis for the first empirical clinical use of antimicrobial in infants with lower respiratory tract infection.
