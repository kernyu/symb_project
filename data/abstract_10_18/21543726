The salicylic acid (SA) regulatory gene HOPW1-1-INTERACTING3 (WIN3) was previously shown to confer resistance to the biotrophic pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Here, we report that WIN3 controls broad-spectrum disease resistance to the necrotrophic pathogen Botrytis cinerea and contributes to basal defense induced by flg22, a 22-amino acid peptide derived from the conserved region of bacterial flagellin proteins. Genetic analysis indicates that WIN3 acts additively with several known SA regulators, including PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT4, NONEXPRESSOR OF PR GENES1 (NPR1), and SA INDUCTION-DEFICIENT2, in regulating SA accumulation, cell death, and/or disease resistance in the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutant acd6-1. Interestingly, expression of WIN3 is also dependent on these SA regulators and can be activated by cell death, suggesting that WIN3-mediated signaling is interconnected with those derived from other SA regulators and cell death. Surprisingly, we found that WIN3 and NPR1 synergistically affect flowering time via influencing the expression of flowering regulatory genes FLOWERING LOCUS C and FLOWERING LOCUS T. Taken together, our data reveal that WIN3 represents a novel node in the SA signaling networks to regulate plant defense and flowering time. They also highlight that plant innate immunity and development are closely connected processes, precise regulation of which should be important for the fitness of plants.
