BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Klebsiella species are of the most common bacteria involved in nosocomial and urinary tract infections. Genetic elements such as class 1 integrons have an important role in the resistance development. In this study, the share of class 1 integrons, the genetic characterization of the integron cassettes and PFGE profiles of the clinical Klebsiella isolates are evaluated in Besat University hospital of Sanandaj, Iran. METHODS: Isolates from 17890 clinical specimens were identified by API20E. Antibiotic susceptibility testing and MIC were done for MDR isolates. For investigating class 1 integrons and gene cassettes, PCR by intI1 integrase and 5'-CS/3'-CS were performed. Integrated gene cassettes were analyzed by PCR-RFLP and sequencing. Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis was carried out for studying of clonality outbreak of isolates. RESULTS: Thirty five Klebsiella spp. were isolated and included 29 K. pneumoniae and 6 K. oxytoca. All the isolates were susceptible to carbapenems while other antibiotics showed high resistant profile. In all Klebsiella spp. PCR for intI1 integrase and 5'-CS/3'-CS were positive (100%). Sequencing for prevalent bands of internal variable regions between 5'-CS/3'-CS showed arr-5, orfD-aacA4 and aad5- dfrA17. PFGE Analysis showed 18 clusters in K. pneumoniae with clonality relatedness in some cases but no relatedness among K. oxytoca isolates. CONCLUSION: High prevalence of class 1 integron carrying gene cassettes confirms that integron-mediated antimicrobial gene cassettes are important in Klebsiella spp. resistance profile. Clone diffusions of MDR Klebsiella spp. which harbor class 1 integrons have threaten the potential in the resistance development in our clinical settings.
