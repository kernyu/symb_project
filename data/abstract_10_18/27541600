HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy (ART) use are associated with perturbations in glucose and lipid metabolism. Increasing incidence of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity highlights the need for early identification and treatment of metabolic dysfunction. Newer ART regimens are less toxic for cellular function and metabolism but have failed to completely eliminate metabolic dysfunction with HIV infection. Additional factors, including viral-host interactions, diet, physical activity, non-ART medications, and aging may further contribute to metabolic disease risk in the HIV setting. We summarize the recent literature regarding the impact on metabolic function of HIV infection, ART, and pharmaceutical or lifestyle prescriptions.
