Molecular analysis is an important tool to investigate Clostridium difficile resistance to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLSB). In particular, the protocols described in this chapter have been designed to investigate the genetic organization of erm(B)-containing elements and to evaluate the capability of these elements to transfer in C. difficile recipient strains using filter mating assay.
