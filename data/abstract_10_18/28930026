We evaluated isolates obtained from children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection throughout Japan during 2008-2015. The highest prevalence of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae was 81.6% in 2012, followed by 59.3% in 2014 and 43.6% in 2015. The prevalence of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae among children in Japan has decreased.
