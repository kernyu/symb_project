BACKGROUND: Studies of effects of IL-1 polymorphisms, CYP2C19 genotype together with antibiotic resistance for H. pylori eradication are rare worldwide. The present study was designed to evaluate efficacy of 10-day sequential therapy (SQT) and 14-day standard triple therapy (STT) with four- times-daily dosing of amoxicillin for H. pylori eradication related to these important host and bacterial factors in Thailand. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective randomized study was performed during March 2015 to January 2016. H. pylori infected gastritis patients were randomized to receive 10-day sequential therapy and 14-day standard triple therapy. CYP2C19 genotyping, IL1 polymorphism (IL-1B and IL-1RN genotypes) and antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed in all patients. 13C-UBT was conducted to confirm H. pylori eradication at least 4 weeks after treatment. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients (33 males and 67 females, mean age=51.1 years) were enrolled. Eradication rate by PP analysis was 97.9% (47/48) with the 10-day SQT regimen and 87.8% (43/49) with 14-day STT regimen (97.9% vs 87.8%; p-value=0.053). Antibiotic susceptibility testing demonstrated 45% resistance to metronidazole, 14.8% to clarithromycin, and 24.1% to levofloxacin. CYP2C19 genotyping revealed 44.9% RM, 49% IM and 6.1% PM. IL-1B and IL-1RN genotypes were demonstrated as 21.4% for CC, 48.1% for TC, 36.8% for TT, 72.7% for 1/1, and 21.2% for 1/2 genotypes, respectively. The 10-day SQT regimen provided 100% eradication in patients with clarithromycin or dual clarithromycin and levofloxacin H. pylori resistant strains. Moreover, the 10-day SQT regimen resulted in a 100% eradication rate in all patients with CYP2C19 genotype RM and almost type of IL-1B (TC and TT) and IL1-RN genotypes ( 1/2 and other). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with 10-day sequential therapy is highly effective for H. pylori eradication regardless of the effects of clarithromycin resistance, dual clarithromycin and levofloxacin resistance, CYP2C19 genotype, IL-1B and IL1-RN genetic polymorphisms and can be used as effective first line therapy in Thailand.
