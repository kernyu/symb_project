The aim of the study was to evaluate the need for active surveillance of antibiotic resistance in ambulatory infections. We measured the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in urinary tract infections (UTIs) (n = 1018) and skin infections (n = 213) diagnosed in outpatients between September 2008 and February 2009 in the Canton of Bern, Switzerland. Samples were stratified into 'solicited' (diagnostic work-up for study purpose only) and 'routine' (diagnostic work-up as part of standard care). Susceptibility patterns were compared for 463 Escherichia coli isolates from UTIs (231 solicited; 232 routine) and 87 Staphylococcus aureus isolates from skin infections (35 solicited; 52 routine). Overall, E. coli showed higher susceptibility to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and norfloxacin in solicited than in routine samples. Among 15-45-year-old patients, susceptibility rates were comparable between solicited and routine samples for all antibiotics except for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. However, among patients >45 years old, isolates from routine samples showed lower susceptibility to all beta-lactams tested and quinolones than those from solicited samples. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli isolates were rare (solicited, 0.4%; routine, 1.7%; p 0.4). Susceptibility patterns of S. aureus were comparable between solicited and routine samples. Therefore, in the outpatient setting, susceptibility rates for E. coli isolates differ by indication for urinary culture and age. Surveillance based on samples taken during standard care may underestimate susceptibility rates for uncomplicated infections, especially among the elderly. Reports of resistance data should include age stratification.
