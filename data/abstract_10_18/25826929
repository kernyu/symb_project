Occurrence and distribution of twelve pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) were investigated in a sewage treatment plant in Shanghai using solid-phase extraction combined with high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-HPLC-MS/MS). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to determine the distribution and removal of seven erythromycin resistance genes (ERY-ARGs). The results showed that five PPCPs including sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin, tetracycline, carbamazepine and triclosan were detected in the collected wastewater samples with concentrations in the ranges of 24.5- 38.7, 47.5-49.2, 43.1-85.4, 2.5-3.9 and 423.2-8 973.3 ng x L(-1), respectively. During the wastewater treatment process, a significant reduction of triclosan was observed, but the removal efficiencies for the other detected PPCPs were relatively low. Additionally, all target ERY-ARGs were detected in the wastewater samples ranging from 9.28 x 10(3) (ermA) to 1.83 x 10(8) (ereA) copies x L(-1) in raw influent. Though significant reductions (1.19 log-3.97 log) of ERY-ARGs were obtained, their concentrations found in the final effluent were still high. Moreover, the concentration of ERY-ARGs exhibited significant positive correlation with the concentration of erythromycin and triclosan (P < 0.05), respectively, elucidating that erythromycin played an important role in the occurrence and spread of ERY-ARGs, while triclosan may confer cross-selection for ERY-ARGs.
