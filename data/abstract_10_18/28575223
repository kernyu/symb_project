There is an urgent need for new antibacterial drugs that are robust against the development of resistance. Drug repurposing is a cost-effective strategy to fast-track the drug development process. Here we examine why the nucleoside and nucleobase analogue drugs in particular present an attractive class for repurposing. Some of these drugs have already been evaluated for their potential as antibacterial agents. In addition to inhibiting bacterial growth and survival, some also act synergistically with antibiotics, and as such can enhance the therapeutic spectrum of currently available antibiotics. Furthermore, nucleoside and nucleobase analogue drugs can inhibit bacterial virulence and biofilm formation. Biofilms are known to impart antibiotic tolerance and are associated with chronic infections. Targeting biofilm formation thus renders pathogens more susceptible to antibiotic treatment and host immune defences. Moreover, specific analogues have properties that make them less susceptible to the development of resistance. Thus, nucleoside and nucleobase analogue drugs ought to be considered as new weapons in our fight against pathogenic bacteria.
