: This 96-week, double-blind, active-controlled, phase 3 study, randomized subjects to elvitegravir once daily or raltegravir twice daily with a fully active, ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor plus a third agent. The proportion of subjects randomized to elvitegravir that achieved and maintained HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL through week 96 was 47.6% (167/351) compared with 45.0% (158/351) for raltegravir with a treatment difference of 2.6% (95% confidence interval: 4.6% to 9.9%). Both regimens were well tolerated, with comparable rates of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities through week 96. Once-daily elvitegravir was noninferior to twice-daily raltegravir, showed durable long-term efficacy, and was well tolerated in HIV+ treatment-experienced patients.
