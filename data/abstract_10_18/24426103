Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces multiple virulence factors that have been associated with quorum sensing. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of drug resistant profiles and quorum sensing related virulence factors. Pseudomonas aeruginosa were collected from different patients hospitalized in China, the isolates were tested for their susceptibility to different common antimicrobial drugs and detected QS-related virulence factors. We identified 170 isolates displaying impaired phenotypic activity, approximately 80 % of the isolates were found to exhibit the QS-dependent phenotypes, among them, 12 isolates were defective in AHLs production, and therefore considered QS-deficient strains. Resistance was most often observed to Cefazolin (81.2 %), followed by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (73.5 %), ceftriaxone (62.4 %) and Cefotaxime, Levofloxacin, Ciprofloxacin (58.8 %), and to a lesser extent Meropenem (20.0 %), Cefepime (18.8 %), and Cefoperazone/sulbactam (2.4 %) The QS-deficient isolates that were negative for virulence factor production were generally less susceptible to the antimicrobials. The results showed a high incidences of antibiotic resistance and virulence properties in P. aeruginosa, and indicate that the clinical use of QS-inhibitory drugs that appear superior to conventional antimicrobials by not exerting any selective pressure on resistant strains.
