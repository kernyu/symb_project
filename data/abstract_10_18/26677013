In this study, we demonstrated that survivin downregulation with TRAIL expression greatly enhanced the cytotoxic death of pancreatic cancer cells after gemcitabine treatment. Using real-time RT-PCR, we analyzed five survivin shRNAs to identify the best target sequence for suppression of human survivin, with the goal of treating gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cells. Survivin shRNA 5, corresponding to target 5, showed the greatest reduction in survivin mRNA levels. Furthermore, combined treatment with survivin shRNA-expressing adenovirus with gemcitabine plus TRAIL decreased uncleaved PARP and increased consequent PARP cleavage, which was correlated with the greatest levels of survivin downregulation and cell death. These results indicate that survivin functions as a common mediator of gemcitabine- and TRAIL-induced cell death. Using a nude mouse model implanted with MiaPaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells, we observed tumor regression induced by an oncolytic adenovirus expressing survivin shRNA and TRAIL plus gemcitabine. Together, our findings provide a strong rationale for treating pancreatic cancer patients with both gemcitabine and oncolytic adenovirus armed with survivin shRNA and TRAIL.
