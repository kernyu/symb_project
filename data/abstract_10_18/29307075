In view of an appreciable increase in resistance of Staphylococcus aureus to the conventional antibiotics, it is desired to develop new effective drugs. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) seem to be attractive candidates. In general, AMPs samples used for in vitro studies consist of a peptide, counter-ion, and water. The presence of the counter-ion could be significant as it affects peptide secondary structure and biological activity. The purpose of this study was to estimate the impact of counter-ion on antistaphylococcal activity of selected AMPs (CAMEL, citropin 1.1, LL-37, pexiganan, temporin A). To do this, three kinds of salts were prepared, namely, acetates, hydrochlorides, and trifluoroacetates. In addition, the hemolytic activity against human red blood cells (hRBCs) and cytotoxicity (HaCaT) were determined. The results indicate that there is a substantial difference between different salts, but the pattern is not consistent for the peptides. In general, the antistaphylococcal activity decreased in the order: CAMEL > temporin A > pexiganan > citropin 1.1 >> LL-37. The highest selectivity indexes were determined for CAMEL hydrochloride, pexiganan acetate, and temporin A trifluoroacetate. This study shows how important is to take into account the kind of counter-ions when designing novel peptide-based antimicrobials.
