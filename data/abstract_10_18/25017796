BACKGROUND: Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) infections in intensive care units (ICUs) are associated with increased mortality. We aimed to determine risk factors for infection and predictors of 30-day mortality in ICU patients with KPC-Kp bloodstream infections (BSI). METHODS: During a 26-month period, patients (n = 273) who stayed more than 6 days in the ICU of the University Hospital of Patras, Greece, were divided into 2 groups, those who developed KPC-Kp BSI and those who did not. K. pneumoniae was identified by Vitek 2 technology. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by agar disk diffusion method. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined by Etest. The presence of the blaKPC gene was confirmed by PCR. Molecular typing was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of XbaI-restricted genomic DNA. Epidemiological data were collected by patient chart review. RESULTS: Five patients had bacteraemia upon admission, while in 48 (17.6%) the BSI developed after 6 days of hospitalization. Risk factors for KPC-Kp BSI in the latter group were the administration of aminoglycosides, number of invasive catheters inserted after the third day, and tracheostomy. The 30-day mortality was 43.4% (23/53 patients). Multivariate analysis revealed that age, SAPS II score at onset of BSI, resistance to colistin, gentamicin, or tigecycline, and septic shock were independently associated with mortality. Treatment with at least 2 appropriate antibiotics was identified as a predictor of a good prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Many risk factors are involved in KPC-Kp BSI among ICU patients. The high mortality in patients with KPC-KP BSI in the ICU requires the implementation of appropriate infection control measures.
