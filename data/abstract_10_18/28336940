IncX4 plasmids are associated with the dissemination of the mcr-1 genes in Enterobacteriaceae. We screened IncX4 plasmids among 2,470 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae and determined the mcr-1 positive isolates. Forty-three isolates were observed to carry IncX4 type plasmid, among which 13 were identified to carry mcr-1 gene. Three representative mcr-1-positive IncX4 plasmids were selected for high-throughput sequencing. Comparative genomics showed that the mcr-1-carrying IncX4 plasmids exhibit remarkable similarity in the backbone, and the major distinction lies in the region containing mcr-1. The major variable regions of all the IncX4 plasmids were fully characterized by PCR-RFLP. The results revealed that the mcr-1 was located on the Variable Region I of IncX4 plasmids in 11 E. coli isolates. Among them, nine E. coli strains possess an epidemic pCSZ4-like IncX4 plasmid containing mcr-1. ISApl1 was presumably involved in the transposition of the mcr-1 cassette and then was lost. Similar genetic contexts were found in different plasmids, even the E. coli chromosome, implying the acquisition of mcr-1 by a unique common mechanism.
