BACKGROUND: There is a need to develop novel therapies for relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and to identify biomarkers predictive for therapeutic response. Lenalidomide was previously shown to induce an overall response rate (ORR) of 28% in patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL. It is currently unknown if response rates differ between patients with different DLBCL subtypes. METHODS: The authors retrospectively evaluated clinical outcomes of patients with germinal center B-cell-like versus nongerminal center B-cell-like DLBCL treated with salvage lenalidomide at 4 academic institutions. RESULTS: Forty patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL were included (24 men; 16 women; median age, 66 years; median of 4 prior treatments, including rituximab chemotherapy). Patients were classified as germinal center B-cell-like (n = 23) or nongerminal center B-cell-like (n = 17) DLBCL according to the Hans algorithm. The subgroups were similar in terms of stage, international prognostic index score, prior number of treatments, and rituximab resistance. A significant difference in clinical response to lenalidomide was observed in nongerminal center B-cell-like versus germinal center B-cell-like patients. ORR was 52.9% versus 8.7% (P = .006); complete response rate was 23.5% versus 4.3%. Median progression-free survival was 6.2 versus 1.7 months (P = .004), although no difference in OS was observed between nongerminal center B-cell-like and germinal center B-cell-like DLBCL patients. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that the 2 major subgroups of patients with DLBCL (germinal center B cell and nongerminal center B cell) have different antitumor responsiveness to lenalidomide in the relapsed/refractory setting. A large international trial (NCT01197560) has been opened to enrollment in an attempt to prospectively validate these retrospective observations.
