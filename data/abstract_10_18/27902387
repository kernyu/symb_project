Bacterial pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) represent a well-known public health problem affecting both healthcare-associated and community populations. Past studies have clearly shown the value of characterizing problem organisms including MRSA through the use of molecular techniques (i.e. strain typing), with the aim of informing local, regional and national efforts in epidemiological analysis and infection control. The country of Libya represents a challenge for such analysis due to limited historical infectious disease information and major political unrest culminating in the Libyan Civil War (Libyan Revolution) in 2011. A MRSA study population of 202 isolates, cultured from patients in Tripoli Medical Center through this historical period (2008-2014), was characterized by both phenotypic and molecular methods. The results revealed a diversification of epidemic MRSA strains over time with generally increasing resistance to fluoroquinolone antibiotics. The study identified prevalent MRSA in comparison to known global epidemic types, providing unique insight into the change of strains and/or characteristics over time especially with reference to the potential influence of the political revolution (i.e. pre- and post-2011).
