BACKGROUND: In recent years in Japan, the rate of clarithromycin (CAM) resistance in Helicobacter pylori has risen to around 30%, and the eradication rate with triple therapy [proton pump inhibitor + amoxicillin (AMPC) + CAM] has been trending downward to around 70%. In 2007, rabeprazole (RPZ)-based triple therapy (RPZ + AMPC + CAM: RAC therapy) was approved in Japan, and a large-scale nationwide study was therefore initiated to evaluate the efficacy and safety of RAC therapy in clinical practice. METHODS: Patients with H. pylori-positive gastric/duodenal ulcer (including ulcer scars) were administered triple therapy comprising RPZ 10 mg, AMPC 750 mg, and CAM 200 mg (or 400 mg), twice daily for 7 days. RESULTS: The eradication rate was 80.7% (2,551/3,162). The results of multivariate analysis indicated the following as factors affecting the eradication rate: sex, treatment compliance, history of H. pylori treatment, presence of urologic disease, presence of respiratory disease, and year of starting treatment. The incidence of adverse drug reactions (such as diarrhea and dysgeusia) was 4.4% (166/3,789). The results of multivariate analysis indicated the following as factors affecting the incidence of adverse drug reactions: sex, daily CAM dose, and history of allergies. CONCLUSION: In a large-scale nationwide study of use in clinical practice, RAC therapy was confirmed to be effective and safe.
