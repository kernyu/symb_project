Drug susceptibility pattern of standard Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain H 37 Rv showed discrepancy in minimum inhibitory concentration method for ethionamide and consistent results were obtained for the other second line drugs namely, kanamycin and ofloxacin. It is, therefore, necessary to revisit the susceptibility testing method for ethionamide for effective clinical management of patients with drug resistant tuberculosis.
