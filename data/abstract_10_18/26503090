BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: A port wine stain (PWS) is a type of capillary vascular malformation composed of malformed, dilated blood vessels within the papillary and reticular dermis. Currently, pulsed dye laser (PDL) is considered the therapeutic gold standard, although greater than 90% of lesions may be refractory to treatment. Studies have shown that a delay in treatment results in a higher proportion of patients who develop hypertrophy and nodularity within lesions that become more resistant to therapy. Therapeutic resistance is multifactorial, but is believed to be largely due to revascularization after laser treatment. Oral sirolimus and topical imiquimod have shown promise as adjunctive therapies to minimize post-laser revascularization, but both have significant side effects. We wish to demonstrate the utility of adjunct topical sirolimus to reduce revascularization after PDL treatment. STUDY DESIGN/PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a single patient case report of a 56-year-old male patient with an extensive PWS. After seeing initial improvement with PDL alone, he began to experience thickening and nodularity of his PWS necessitating surgical debulking. Since this procedure, topical sirolimus 0.5% ointment has been added to his treatment regimen as an adjunct to PDL. The patient is being treated with PDL (Vbeam Perfecta, Candela/Syneron, Wayland, MA) every 4-6 weeks at varied settings with the following laser parameters: fluence 9-11 J/cm(2), pulse duration 0.45-1.5 ms, focal spot size 7 mm, cooling 30/20. Sirolimus 0.5% ointment is applied to the area twice daily. RESULTS: The patient showed significant improvement in color and texture of his PWS. Compared to the initial therapy of PDL alone, topical sirolimus ointment in conjunction with PDL demonstrated greater improvement and maintenance of therapeutic results with fewer overall laser treatments. CONCLUSION: Topical sirolimus 0.5% ointment is a safe and effective adjunct to PDL in the treatment of PWS.
