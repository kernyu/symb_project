OBJECTIVE: To highlight the issue of freely available fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) of antimicrobials. METHODS: A critique of two such antimicrobial FDCs was undertaken wherein the following aspects were assessed - rational and regulatory issues and justification for clinical use. Available in vitro, in vivo (animals and humans) evidence from published literature was analysed. CONCLUSIONS: There are several inadequately addressed aspects of the considered FDCs which are available in Indian market. In view of the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance, this issue must get the required attention.
