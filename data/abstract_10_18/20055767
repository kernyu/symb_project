Tuberculous meningitis is a severe form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. The exact incidence and prevalence are not known. In countries with high burden of pulmonary tuberculosis, the incidence is expected to be proportionately high. Children are much more vulnerable. Human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients have a high incidence of tuberculous meningitis. The hallmark pathological processes are meningeal inflammation, basal exudates, vasculitis and hydrocephalus. Headache, vomiting, meningeal signs, focal deficits, vision loss, cranial nerve palsies and raised intracranial pressure are dominant clinical features. Diagnosis is based on the characteristic clinical picture, neuroimaging abnormalities and cerebrospinal fluid changes (increased protein, low glucose and mononuclear cell pleocytosis). Cerebrospinal fluid smear examination, mycobacterial culture or polymerase chain reaction is mandatory for bacteriological confirmation. The mortality and morbidity of tuberculous meningitis are exceptionally high. Prompt diagnosis and early treatment are crucial. Decision to start antituberculous treatment is often empirical. WHO guidelines recommend a 6 months course of antituberculous treatment; however, other guidelines recommend a prolonged treatment extended to 9 or 12 months. Corticosteroids reduce the number of deaths. Resistance to antituberculous drugs is associated with a high mortality. Patients with hydrocephalus may need ventriculo-peritoneal shunting. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination protects to some degree against tuberculous meningitis in children.
