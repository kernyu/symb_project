OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to assess the outcome of antimicrobial susceptibility-guided therapies in Helicobacter pylori-infected individuals who had undergone unsuccessful prior eradication treatments. METHODS: From October 2004 to December 2013, 481 H. pylori-positive patients with prior unsuccessful eradication treatments were administered susceptibility-guided salvage eradication treatments. Six months on, treatment outcome was assessed by urea breath test, stool antigen ELISA, Helicobacter urease test or microbiology and/or histopathology. RESULTS: Resistance to metronidazole and clarithromycin was high in patients with prior unsuccessful eradication treatments and was dependent on the number of treatment failures. Susceptibility-guided salvage eradication treatments achieved eradication rates of nearly 70% in these patients. No particular regimen was significantly better than another. CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing prevents prescription of inefficient antimicrobials and enables individualized and promising salvage treatments in patients with prior unsuccessful eradication treatments.
