Brosimum gaudichaudii Trecul., a plant that belongs to Moraceae family, is found throughout the Brazilian Cerrado. The antimicrobial activities of ethanolic bark and leaf extracts of B. gaudichaudii were tested against multiresistant bacteria isolated from diabetic foot infections (DFIs). Antimicrobial activity of the extracts was evaluated by agar disc diffusion (DD) and broth dilution (BD) methods. By BD method, bark (53.85, 45.83%) and leaf (42.31, 50.00%) extracts contained antimicrobial activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. Increased antimicrobial activity was observed when bark and leaf extracts were tested against Staphylococcus aureus (63.64%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (66.67%). Statistical analyses of bark and leaf extract demonstrated antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive (p = 0.000) and gram-negative bacteria (p = 0.012). Extract of bark (p = 0.075) or leaf (p = 0.005) associated with ACA antibiotic showed antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria. Our study suggests that the bark and leaf extracts contain bioactive compounds with antimicrobial activity against multidrug resistant strains.
