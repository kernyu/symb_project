A lactic-acid producing bacterium was isolated from the rumen of lambs with rumen acidosis. The cells were gram-positive, nonmotile, nonsporing, catalase negative spherical, 1.5-2.0 mum in diameter, and occur in pairs and tetrads. Analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA indicated that the rumen bacterium was a strain of Pediococcus acidilactici with 99% of nucleotide homology. This bacterium was sensible to monensin and lasalocid at the unique dose tested of 300 ppm. The concentration of lactic acid and DM degradation decreased (P<0.05) when monensin or lasalocid were added to the culture media after 24, 48 and 72 h of incubation. In contrast, total VFA concentration and pH were higher (P<0.05) in the culture media added with the ionophores. Up to now S. bovis is considered the main ruminal bacterium related with rumen acidosis, but the importance of P. acidilactici should be also reconsidered in experimental studies focused on the control rumen acidosis.
