Leishmania donovani infects macrophages, disrupting immune homeostasis. The underlying mechanism that sustains infection remains unresolved. In view of the potential of Wnt5a signaling to support immune homeostasis, we evaluated the interrelationship of Wnt5a signaling and Leishmania donovani infection. Upon infecting macrophages separately with antimony drug-sensitive and -resistant L. donovani, we noted disruption in the steady-state level of Wnt5a. Moreover, inhibition of Wnt5a signaling by small interfering RNA transfection in vitro or by use of inhibitor of Wnt production in vivo led to an increase in cellular parasite load. In contrast, treatment of macrophages with recombinant Wnt5a caused a decrease in the load of antimony-sensitive and -resistant parasites, thus confirming that Wnt5a signaling antagonizes L. donovani infection. Using inhibitors of the Wnt5a signaling intermediates Rac1 and Rho kinase, we demonstrated that Wnt5a-mediated inhibition of parasite infection in macrophages is Rac1/Rho dependent. Furthermore, phalloidin staining and reactive oxygen species estimation of Wnt5a-treated macrophages suggested that a Wnt5a-Rac/Rho-mediated decrease in parasite load is associated with an increase in F- actin assembly and NADPH oxidase activity. Moreover, live microscopy of L. donovani-infected macrophages treated with Wnt5a demonstrated increased endosomal/lysosomal fusions with parasite-containing vacuoles (parasitophorous vacuoles [PV]). An increase in PV-endosomal/lysosomal fusion accompanied by augmented PV degradation in Wnt5a-treated macrophages was also apparent from transmission electron microscopy of infected cells. Our results suggest that, although L. donovani evades host immune response, at least in part through inhibition of Wnt5a signaling, revamping Wnt5a signaling can inhibit L. donovani infection, irrespective of drug sensitivity or resistance.
