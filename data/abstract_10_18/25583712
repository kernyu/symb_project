To explore the phenotypic and genotypic characterization of pyrazinamide (PZA) resistance among multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) isolates in Zhejiang province, a total of 274 MDR-TB isolates were collected. Drug susceptibility testing and spoligotyping were performed on all clinical isolates. In addition, the mutated features of PZA-resistant loci, including pncA and rpsA, were also analyzed by DNA sequencing. Our results showed that the prevalence of PZA resistance among MDR-TB strains in Zhejiang province was 43.07% and that PZA resistance was associated with concomitant resistance to streptomycin. The majority of PZA-resistant MDR-TB isolates belonged to the Beijing family. Mutations within pncA, not rpsA, constituted the primary mechanism of PZA resistance. Among 118 PZA-resistant isolates, 53 different mutations were observed in pncA, and most of them were point mutations. Compared with the phenotypic data, DNA sequencing of pncA has sensitivity and specificity of 77.97% and 96.79%, respectively. Analysis of pncA provided a robust tool for rapid detection of PZA drug resistance.
