Prevalence and predictors of transmitted drug resistance (TDR), defined as the presence of at least one WHO surveillance drug resistance mutation (SDRM), were investigated in antiretroviral-naive HIV-1-infected patients, with a genotypic resistance test (GRT) performed </=6 months before starting cART between 2000 and 2010. 3163 HIV-1 sequences were selected (69% subtype B). Overall, the prevalence of TDR was 12% (13.2% subtype B, 9% non-B). TDR significantly declined overall and for the single drug classes. Older age independently predicted increased odds of TDR, whereas a more recent GRT, a higher HIV-RNA and C vs. B subtype predicted lower odds of TDR.
