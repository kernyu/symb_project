Fosfomycin (FOM) is an antibiotic with a small relative molecular weight (138.1) and a long half-life, and has a unique chemical structure and antibacterial mechanisms. It exerts a bactericidal activity by inhibiting the early synthesis of bacterial cell walls. It is also a broad-spectrum antibiotic with a good drug tolerance and compliance and a low pressure to bacterial resistance, but no cross-resistance with other antibiotics. Recent studies show the effectiveness of FOM in the treatment of acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections and urogenital tract infections as well, such as prostatitis and epididymitis. This review focuses on the clinical application of FOM in the treatment of infectious diseases of the urogenital tract.
