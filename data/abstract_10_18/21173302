OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationships among (Fas) promoter methylation, Fas expression, and apoptotic sensitivity in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). DESIGN: Laboratory investigation. SETTING: Dermatology research unit of a university medical center. SAMPLES: Five CTCL lines and Sezary syndrome blood. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment of cells with 5-azacytidine (aza), methotrexate, and interferon alfa-2b. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Fas promoter methylation, Fas expression, and sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis. RESULTS: Fas promoter methylation correlates inversely with the level of Fas transcript, protein, and apoptotic sensitivity in CTCL. Increased DNA methylation also correlates with decreased NFkB (nuclear factor kappa-light chain enhancer of activated B cells) binding to the Fas promoter. All of these relationships were reversed by the DNA-demethylating agent, 5-aza. We found that methotrexate also functions as a DNA-demethylating agent by depleting methyl donors and, together with interferon alfa-2b, upregulates Fas and enhances sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: These findings help explain the previously reported impressive responses of patients with advanced CTCL to combination therapy with methotrexate and interferon alfa. They also provide a new rationale for the treatment of CTCL with methotrexate and its use in combination with other agents.
