Dermatologists perform several minor surgical procedures in their offices on a daily basis that result in superficial cutaneous wounds. Conventionally, the approach to postoperative care for these superficial wounds has been the application of a topical antibiotic ointment. In reality, this practice is based more on perception and habit, and not on sound scientific evidence, especially regarding reduction in postoperative infection rates and risk of adverse reactions. In addition, the routine use of a topical antibiotic in this scenario may contribute to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains, and has been shown to increase the risk of allergic contact dermatitis. With few new antibiotics in development and several worldwide initiatives to curb the increase in antibiotic resistance in progress, it is important that clinicians reevaluate the standard postoperative wound care that is used after superficial office-based dermatologic procedures.
