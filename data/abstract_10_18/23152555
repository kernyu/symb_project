The profiles of 61 Candida tropicalis isolates from 43 patients (28 adults and 15 children) diagnosed with candidemia at two teaching hospitals in Sao Paulo, Brazil, were characterized by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). For the 14 patients who had bloodstream infections, 32 isolates were serially collected from their blood and/or catheters. Thirty-nine diploid sequence types (DSTs) were differentiated. According to the C. tropicalis MLST database (http://pubmlst.org/ctropicalis/), 36 DSTs and 23 genotypes identified from the 61 isolates had not previously been described. This report represents the first study to characterize sequential isolates of C. tropicalis from candidemia cases in South America. Microvariation in a single gene was found in the sequential isolates from 7 patients. The main polymorphisms occurred in the alleles of the XYR1 gene, specifically at nucleotide positions 215, 242, and 344. Macrovariation in six gene fragments was detected in the isolates from 3 patients. eBURST analysis added two new groups to this study (groups 6 and 18). Additionally, susceptibility tests indicate that 3 isolates were resistant to fluconazole. No correlation was found between the DSTs and susceptibility to fluconazole and/or selective antifungal pressure. Two patients were sequentially infected with resistant and susceptible strains. MLST is an important tool for studying the genetic diversity of multiple/sequential isolates of patients with candidemia, allowing the comparison of our data with those from other regions of the world, as well as allowing an analysis of the genetic relationship among several clones in sequential isolates from the same or different candidemia patient sites (blood or catheter).
