OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of drug resistance mutations among HIV-positive women in Malawi 18 months after discontinuing nevirapine-based ART for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission. PATIENTS AND METHODS: HIV-infected antiretroviral-naive (except for single-dose nevirapine) pregnant Malawian women receiving a nevirapine-based triple antiretroviral regimen from Week 25 of gestation until 6 months of breastfeeding were included in this analysis. Drug resistance was assessed in HIV-DNA 24 months post-partum and at baseline (before the initiation of treatment). In patients with resistance, the presence of mutations was also evaluated in the corresponding plasma samples. RESULTS: Seven out of 42 (16.7%) women studied had archived drug resistance at Month 24 [six cases had NNRTI-associated mutations and two cases the M184I mutation]. In four cases, resistance mutations were already present at baseline (all NNRTI mutations). In three cases, there was an emergence of 'new' resistance (also present in the plasma in one case). Of the 35 women without resistance mutations at Month 24, only one subject had resistance mutations at baseline. Baseline resistance was significantly more common among women with mutations at 24 months compared with those harbouring a WT virus (4/7 versus 1/35, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Among women who had discontinued drugs 6 months post-partum, only 3/42 (7.1%) had accumulated new resistance mutations in HIV-DNA 2 years after delivery. These findings are reassuring in terms of the safety of the Option B strategy for the prevention of HIV mother-to-child transmission.
