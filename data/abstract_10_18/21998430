We prospectively investigated the diagnostic utility of the Xpert MTB/RIF (Mycobacterium tuberculosis/rifampin [RIF] resistance) assay in 20 cases with confirmed tuberculous pleural effusion. The sensitivity and specificity of the Xpert assay in pleural fluid were 25% and 100%, respectively. All cases positive by the Xpert assay were also positive by pleural fluid culture.
