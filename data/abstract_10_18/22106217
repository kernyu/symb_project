Analysis of five CTX-M-2-producing Proteus mirabilis isolates in Japan demonstrated that bla(CTX-M-2) was located on the chromosome in four isolates and on IncT plasmids in three isolates, including two isolates that also carried the gene on the chromosome. In all four isolates with chromosomal bla(CTX-M-2), ISEcp1 was responsible for the integration of the gene into the chromosome. Three different sites in the P. mirabilis genomic sequence were utilized as integration sites.
