Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae has recently been reported as a new, multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogen in several hospitals from various Italian regions. Through Micronet, a new Italian sentinel laboratory-based surveillance network, we studied the trend of non-susceptibility of K. pneumoniae to selected carbapenems (imipenem and/or meropenem) in 14 of the 15 hospitals participating in the network. Analysis of data from 1 January 2009 to 30 April 2012 revealed a statistically significant increasing trend (p<0.01) in the proportion of carbapenem non-susceptible K. pneumoniae isolates from clinical specimens (from 2.2 % in 2009 to 19.4% in 2012). The increase in the proportion of non-susceptibility was very large for isolates from the respiratory tract (from 5.3% in 2009 to 38.5% in 2012) and blood (from 5.4% in 2009 to 29.2% in 2012). The results demonstrate the urgent need in Italy for infection control, guidelines, antibiotic stewardship programmes and utilisation of surveillance systems, such as Micronet, which are capable of receiving data from hospitals in real time for many pathogens and types of clinical specimens.
