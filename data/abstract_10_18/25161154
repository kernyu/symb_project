OBJECTIVE: Numerous studies have shown that the tolerance of children to fluoroquinolones (FQs) is satisfactory, and some indications have been recently agreed upon. However, vigilance is required when prescribing FQ to children. The aim of our study was to describe the prescription of FQs to children hospitalized in our hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a chart retrospective observational study at the Robert-Debre teaching Hospital between January 2009 and December 2010. Data was collected about patients (name, sex, weight, age) and prescribed treatments (indication, international nonproprietary names, dose, number of doses per day, administration route). Quality of collected data was assessed by analyzing the clinical files of 32 randomly selected patients. RESULTS: We analyzed data for 397 patients (3 days - 18 years old and 640 g - 115 kg). Ciprofloxacin was prescribed for 382 patients (96%), ofloxacin for 10 patients (3%), and levofloxacin for 5 patients (1%). Febrile neutropenia was the most common indication (108 patients, i.e., 27%), followed by inflammatory bowel disease (50 patients, 13%). Doses conformed to recommendations for 88% of the patients. Analysis of the 32 cases indicated an overall compliance percentage of 94.4%. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to collect so much data on FQ prescriptions for hospitalized children. Use in practice went beyond the licensed indication. Doses were consistent with those for recommended indications.
