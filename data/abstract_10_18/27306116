Increasing antimicrobial resistance in urinary tract infections (UTI) is a concern. To evaluate resistance trends, 3498 Escherichia coli UTI isolates were collected from 2010 to 2014 in the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART) in Canada and United States (US). ESBL phenotype and susceptibility were determined using CLSI microdilution and breakpoints. US ESBL rates increased in 2010-2014 (7.8-18.3%, P < 0.0001), especially among hospital-associated (HA) infections, males, and older patients (>/=65 years). Overall, ESBL rates in Canada showed no significant trend (10.4-13.0%. P = 0.079), and were lower than US rates in recent years, but increased significantly among community-associated (CA) infections, females, and older patients. In the US, but not Canada, susceptibility to cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones among 2013-2014 isolates was significantly lower in isolates from HA than CA UTI, males than females, and >/=65- than <65-year-olds. These observations confirm increasing resistance in E. coli. Subgroup analyses like these may help direct empirical therapy.
