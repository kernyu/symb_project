Candida tropicalis is considered the first or the second non-Candida albicans Candida (NCAC) species most frequently isolated from candidosis, mainly in patients admitted in intensive care units (ICUs), especially with cancer, requiring prolonged catheterization, or receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. The proportion of candiduria and candidemia caused by C. tropicalis varies widely with geographical area and patient group. Actually, in certain countries, C. tropicalis is more prevalent, even compared with C. albicans or other NCAC species. Although prophylactic treatments with fluconazole cause a decrease in the frequency of candidosis caused by C. tropicalis, it is increasingly showing a moderate level of fluconazole resistance. The propensity of C. tropicalis for dissemination and the high mortality associated with its infections might be strongly related to the potential of virulence factors exhibited by this species, such as adhesion to different host surfaces, biofilm formation, infection and dissemination, and enzymes secretion. Therefore, the aim of this review is to outline the present knowledge on all the above-mentioned C. tropicalis virulence traits.
