INTRODUCTION: Diabetes mellitus is a highly prevalent chronic progressive disease with complications that include diabetic-foot ulcers. METHODS: Enterococci isolated from diabetic-foot infections were identified, evaluated by macro-restriction analysis, and screened for virulence traits and antimicrobial resistance. RESULTS: All isolates were considered multidrug-resistant, cytolysin and gelatinase producers, and the majority also demonstrated the ability to produce biofilms. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate the importance of enterococci in diabetic-foot infection development and persistence, especially regarding their biofilm-forming ability and resistance to clinically relevant antibiotics.
