OBJECTIVES: To describe and estimate the rate of breakthrough invasive mould diseases (IMD) in patients receiving caspofungin. METHODS: Retrospective, non-interventional study conducted in three University Hospitals. RESULTS: Nineteen breakthrough infections have been identified including 13 aspergillosis, 2 mucormycosis, a fusariosis, a Hormographiella aspergillata infection and 2 possible IMD. Cases were equally distributed between the centres. Fourteen patients had a haematologic malignancy, four were transplant recipients (allogeneic haematopoietic stem cells in three, liver in one) and one had hepatic cirrhosis. Caspofungin has been prescribed as prophylaxis (n = 3), empirical therapy (n = 9) or directed therapy for candidemia (n = 5) or aspergillosis (n = 2). Aspergillus galactomannan was positive in serum or in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in 10 of the 13 aspergillosis. Median duration of caspofungin treatment before breakthrough IMD was 15 days. Nine patients died within twelve weeks. Rate of breakthrough IMD in onco-haematology patients has been estimated to 7.3% for all mould infections and to 4.2% when restricted to documented aspergillosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our data call for Aspergillus galactomannan monitoring and close clinical and radiological examination in case of persistence or recurrence of infection signs in high-risk patients receiving caspofungin.
