We analyzed 85 Neisseria spp. strains collected by swabbing from neutropenic patients to determine the prevalence of reduced susceptibility to penicillin and to ascertain the clonal relationship between these strains. High genetic diversity and an elevated level of penicillin resistance were found among commensal Neisseria clinical isolates.
