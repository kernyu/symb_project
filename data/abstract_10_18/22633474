OBJECTIVES: The authors had for aim to monitor Enterobacteriaceae resistance to colistin, during 6 years (2005-2010), and to study the epidemiology of Enterobacteriaceae resistant strains isolated in the Sfax region (Tunisia). DESIGN: This retrospective study was carried out in the microbiology laboratory, at the Habib Bourguiba teaching hospital in Sfax. All strains of colistin resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolated from patients were studied. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty one strains of colistin resistant Enterobacteriaceae were isolated from 93 patients. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequent species (60.2%), followed by Enterobacter cloacae (26.9%), and Escherichia coli (12.9%). Thirteen strains (E. cloacae) were heteroresistant to colistin. Eighty one isolates (87.1%) were resistant to third generation cephalosporins. The rate of resistance to colistin ranged from 0.09% for E. coli to 1.2% for K. pneumoniae, and 1.5% for E. cloacae. A progressively increasing colistin resistance was observed for K. pneumoniae. Most resistant strains were isolated from urine in the urology department. Previous exposure to colistin was reported in 59.2% of patients. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis typing revealed different clones. CONCLUSIONS: Colistin resistance in Enterobacteriaceae is a worrying phenomenon in Sfax. It is related to polyclonal diffusion. Continuous epidemiological monitoring and a rational use of colistin are necessary to limit the spreading of these colistin resistant strains and to maintain this antibiotic's effectiveness.
