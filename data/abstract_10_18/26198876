Multidrug resistant pulmonary tuberculosis was diagnosed to a 32-year-old man. An AA-amyloidosis was subsequently diagnosed on the renal biopsy performed for nephrotic syndrome and macroscopic hematuria. A 6-drug antibiotic treatment was delivered quickly after first results of genotypic antibiogram given the renal failure, and was secondarily adapted to the phenotypic antibiogram. Multidrug therapy was fairly well tolerated. Clinical and biological improving were slow. Although tuberculosis is a classic cause of amyloidosis, this is the first case reporting an association between a multidrug resistant case and an amyloidosis in adults. This case also raises the question of MDR probabilistic treatments in situations whether a vital organ prognosis is engaged.
