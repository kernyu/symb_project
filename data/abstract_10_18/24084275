BACKGROUND: We reviewed the outcomes of patients treated for nontyphoidal Salmonella-infected abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) treatment at a single center. METHODS: This was a retrospective chart review of 26 patients with nontyphoidal Salmonella-infected AAA. Four patients underwent medical therapy alone, while 22 patients underwent surgical therapy. Revascularization method selection was dependent on preoperative antibiotic response in the surgical therapy group. RESULTS: The in-hospital mortality rate for the surgical therapy group was 14%, while the rate for the medical therapy group was 100%. Overall survival for the surgical therapy group was 82%, while the reinfection rate was 9%. In the surgical therapy group, 2 patients had periaortic abscesses and underwent in situ prosthetic graft replacement; none developed graft-related complications or died in the hospital. Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank testing revealed no significant differences in graft-related complication and overall survival rates between in situ prosthetic graft group and extra-anatomic bypass group. Salmonella choleraesuis had a higher antimicrobial resistance rate than other isolates. The predictors of survival were clinical presentation of abdominal pain and receiving surgical therapy. CONCLUSIONS: If patients with Salmonella-infected AAAs have good responses to preoperative antibiotic therapy, in situ prosthetic graft replacement is a viable revascularization method, even in the situation of periaortic abscess presentation formation.
