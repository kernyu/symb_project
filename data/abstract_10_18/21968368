Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) is an increasingly common cause of health care-associated urinary tract infections. Antimicrobials with in vitro activity against CRKP are typically limited to polymyxins, tigecycline, and often, aminoglycosides. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of cases of CRKP bacteriuria at New York-Presbyterian Hospital from January 2005 through June 2010 to compare microbiologic clearance rates based on the use of polymyxin B, tigecycline, or an aminoglycoside. We constructed three active antimicrobial cohorts based on the active agent used and an untreated cohort of cases that did not receive antimicrobial therapy with Gram-negative activity. Microbiologic clearance was defined as having a follow-up urine culture that did not yield CRKP. Cases without an appropriate follow-up culture or that received multiple active agents or less than 3 days of the active agent were excluded. Eighty-seven cases were included in the active antimicrobial cohorts, and 69 were included in the untreated cohort. The microbiologic clearance rate was 88% in the aminoglycoside cohort (n = 41), compared to 64% in the polymyxin B (P = 0.02; n = 25), 43% in the tigecycline (P < 0.001; n = 21), and 36% in the untreated (P < 0.001; n = 69) cohorts. Using multivariate analysis, the odds of clearance were lower for the polymyxin B (odds ratio [OR], 0.10; P = 0.003), tigecycline (OR, 0.08; P = 0.001), and untreated (OR, 0.14; P = 0.003) cohorts than for the aminoglycoside cohort. Treatment with an aminoglycoside, when active in vitro, was associated with a significantly higher rate of microbiologic clearance of CRKP bacteriuria than treatment with either polymyxin B or tigecycline.
