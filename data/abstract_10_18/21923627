The diagnosis of HIV, quality of follow-up, and treatment among immigrants are greatly influenced by cultural factors and access to the healthcare system. Israel, an immigrant-based society, features 3 cardinal HIV-positive patient groups, namely non-immigrant Israelis, legal immigrants (mainly from Ethiopia), and illegal African work-immigrants. While the first 2 groups are covered by a national health insurance, the latter group depends on an unstructured system of antiretroviral therapy (ART) supply. In the early 1990s, a national mentoring programme was implemented for legal immigrants. The programme involves community-based Ethiopian mentors who follow HIV-positive Ethiopians. In this retrospective cohort study we reviewed the files of HIV-positive patients diagnosed between 1995 and 2007, focusing on comparison between HIV-positive non-immigrant populations with both legal Ethiopian immigrants and the often overlooked illegal immigrants. Our results point to a substantial rate of loss to follow-up among the illegal immigrants. When comparing non-immigrants to legal immigrants, both feature similar adherence to follow-up, exposure and response to ART, despite profound cultural differences. Our results suggest that ethnic-related obstacles in HIV diagnosis and treatment may be overcome by 'cultural mediators', yet, addressing the silent mass of HIV-positive illegal work-immigrants, who are deprived of such programme benefits, poses a major challenge to Western health authorities.
