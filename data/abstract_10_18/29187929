Introduction: In sub-Saharan Africa, diagnostic methods for tuberculosis are inadequate and are essentially based on microscopy. They constitute a real obstacle to the control of tuberculosis. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of GeneXpert MTB/RIF test compared to classical Ziehl-Neelsen staining at the the general referral provincial hospital of Bukavu, in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo after 10 months of use. Methods: The results of Ziehl-Neelsen staining and GeneXpert MTB/RIF molecular biology test performed in 452 patients with suspected tuberculosis were collected. This study compares the validity of these different diagnostic tests in the detection of tuberculosis. Results: In the entire group, the frequency of the pulmonary tuberculosis was 16.3%. The positivity rate was significantly higher in GeneXpert MTB/RIF test than in Ziehl-Neelsen staining in the entire group (15.9% vs 9.3%, p = 0.03) and in HIV seropositive patients (52.0% vs 24.0%; p = 0.007). However, the sensitivity of GeneXpert MTB/RIF test compared to that in Ziehl-Neelsen staining wasn't maximum (95.2%). Finally, GeneXpert MTB/RIF test detected rifampicin resistance in 20.8%. Conclusion: This study confirms the superiority of GeneXpert MTB/RIF test compared to Ziehl-Neelsen staining in the detection of tuberculosis and in the prediction of multi-resistance. Its systematic use coupled with Ziehl-Neelsen staining would better control tuberculosis in sub-Saharan Africa.
