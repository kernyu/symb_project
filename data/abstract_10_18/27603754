Neutrophils play an important role in antimicrobial defense as the first line of innate immune system. Recently, the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) has been identified as a killing mechanism of neutrophils against invading microbes. Mycoplasma pneumoniae, a causative agent of respiratory infection, has been shown to be resistant to in vitro killing by neutrophils, suggesting that the bacterium might circumvent bactericidal activity of NETs. In this study, we investigated whether M. pneumoniae possesses resistance mechanisms against the NETs-mediated killing of neutrophils and found that the bacterium degrades the NETs induced upon M. pneumoniae infection. The NETs-degrading ability of M. pneumoniae required the production of a secreted nuclease, Mpn491, capable of using Mg(2)(+) as a cofactor for its hydrolytic activity. Moreover, the inactivation of the nuclease resulted in increased susceptibility of M. pneumoniae to the NETs-mediated killing of neutrophils. The results suggest that M. pneumoniae employs Mpn491 as a means for evading the killing mechanism of neutrophils.
