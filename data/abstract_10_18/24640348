Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are widely dispersed in our environment. Pulmonary disease, lymphadenitis, skin and soft tissue infections, bone and joint infections and disseminated infections are common clinical syndromes in immuno-compromised patients. NTM infections are frequently overlooked in developing countries like India withendemic TB due to non-specific clinical manifestations, unfamiliarity of clinicians with mycobacteria, and inadequacy of laboratory services. Here we report a case of multidrug resistant (MDR) pulmonary NTM infection in a non-HIV infected child and her response to therapy.
