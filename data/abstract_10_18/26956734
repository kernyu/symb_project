BACKGROUND: The problem of prosthetic heart valve selection in fertile women with acquired heart defects remains crucial in modern cardiology. Mechanical heart valves require lifelong indirect anticoagulant therapy, which has significant fetal toxicity and is unacceptable for women planning pregnancy. Bioprosthetic heart valves are the best choice for fertile women; however, their durability is limited, and reoperations are required. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the clinical case of a 21-year-old Russian woman with infectious endocarditis who underwent heart valve replacement with an epoxy-treated mitral valve prosthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Epoxy-treated bioprosthetic heart valves can be used without long-term anticoagulant therapy because of their optimal hemodynamic functional parameters. Moreover, their high thromboresistance and resistance to infection improve patients' quality of life in their late postoperative period. We recommend these valves both in older persons and in young patients including women who are planning pregnancy.
