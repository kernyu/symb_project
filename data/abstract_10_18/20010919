OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobial resistance has decreased eradication rates of Helicobacter pylori worldwide. The objective of this study was to determine whether a sequential therapy regimen is effective in eradicating H. pylori in adults with nonulcer dyspepsia or peptic ulcer disease in Thailand. METHODS: A total of 115 patients with dyspepsia or peptic ulcer were enrolled in the study. (14)C-urea breath test, upper endoscopy, rapid urease test, bacterial culture, and antibiotic resistance assessment were conducted during the course of the treatment. In all, 115 patients underwent a 10-day sequential regimen, which consisted of lansoprazole (30 mg) plus amoxicillin (1 g) twice a day for 5 days, then lansoprazole (30 mg) with metronidazole (500 mg) twice a day, and clarithromycin (1,000 mg) once a day for another 5 consecutive days. Successful eradication was evaluated by negative urea breath test at least 4 weeks after stopping treatment. RESULTS: Successful eradication was achieved in 106 of 115 patients (95%). All patients completed the treatment, without any dropouts. Mild adverse effects included headache and palpitations. The prevalence rate of clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori was found to be 6.1%. CONCLUSIONS: The 10-day sequential treatment for H. pylori is well tolerated and provides a high eradication rate. This regimen can overcome the emergence of antibiotic resistance and may have a role as a first-line treatment for H. pylori infection in Thailand.
