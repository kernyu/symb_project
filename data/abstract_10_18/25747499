Novel isocryptolepine analogues have been conveniently synthesized and evaluated for antimalarial and antiproliferative activities. We have found 3-fluoro-8-bromo-isocryptolepine (1n) to have the highest activities against chloroquine-resistant K1, chloroquine-sensitive 3D7, and chloroquine- and mefloquine-resistant SKF58 and SRIV35 strains. Several fluorine-substituted analogues (1b, 1n, and 1q) also showed excellent selectivities while maintaining good to excellent activities against all four Plasmodium falciparum strains. Additionally, antiproliferative properties of isocryptolepine derivatives against HepG2, HuCCA-1, MOLT-3 and A549 cancer cell lines are reported for the first time in this study. 2-Chloroisocryptolepine (1c) and benzo-fused-2-chloroisocryptolepine (1i) showed significant bioactivities whereas several novel fluorinated compounds and 2-chloro-8-bromoisocryptolepine (1f) displayed excellent selectivities.
