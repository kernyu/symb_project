OBJECTIVE: To monitor microbes, focusing on drug resistance, on the hands of the personnel of four departments of a tertiary hospital (ICU, neonatal unit, internal medicine ward and surgical ward) and explore differences between departments, professions and genders. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hand sampling from 125 healthcare employees was conducted followed by isolation, identification and antibiotic resistance profiling of different microbial species. RESULTS: Staphylococcus spp was the most prevalent microbe (76/125, 60.8%), followed by different Gram-negative pathogens (45.6%). ICU employees had a significant probability to have Gram-negative contamination [OR 3.627 (95% CI 1.220-10.782)], independently of gender or profession. Staphylococcus spp presence was associated with working in the internal medicine ward [OR 6.976 (95% CI 1.767-25.540)] and the surgical ward [OR 5.795 (95% CI 1.586-21.178)]. Staphylococcus spp was more prevalent in males vs. females (81.3% vs. 54.9%, p=0.008) and in medical vs. nursing personnel (76.9% vs. 54.8, p=0.019). In the majority of Gram-negative isolates (56.1%), at least one multi-drug resistant (MDR) or extensively drug resistant (XDR) strain was isolated. A statistically significant higher prevalence of XDR Gram-negative microbes was found on the hands of nursing personnel (22.2% vs. 2.3% for medical doctors, p=0.014). Only 2 methicillin resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) out of the 12 Staphylococcus aureus positive samples were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Employees in the ICU are more prone to Gram-negative and not to Gram-positive hand contamination. MDR and XDR pathogens are prevalent, and are associated with nursing profession.
