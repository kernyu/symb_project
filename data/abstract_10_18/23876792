In Korea, Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected in 255/2,089 respiratory specimens collected during 2000-2011; 80 isolates carried 23S rRNA gene mutations, and 69/123 culture-positive samples with the mutation were resistant to 5 macrolides. During 2000-2011, prevalence of the mutation increased substantially. These findings have critical implications for the treatment of children with mycoplasma pneumonia.
