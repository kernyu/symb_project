OBJECTIVES: To characterize the chromosomally encoded novel floR gene variant floRv from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia of porcine origin and elucidate the gene order and content of the floRv-flanking regions in an MDR genomic island (GI). METHODS: Whole genome sequencing was used to identify the unknown florfenicol resistance gene in S. maltophilia strain GZP-Sm1. The candidate gene was cloned into pMD19-T and Escherichia coli transformants carrying this vector were tested for phenicol MICs. Flanking sequences of the florfenicol resistance gene were identified by a de novo assembly and a primer walking strategy. RESULTS: GZP-Sm1 carried a floR gene variant, designated floRv. E. coli clones carrying this gene were resistant to chloramphenicol and florfenicol. The deduced 404 amino acid FloRv protein showed 84.1%-91.8% amino acid identity to various FloR proteins. The gene floRv was located in an MDR region within a 40 226 bp GI region. Six resistance genes, including floRv (phenicol resistance), tetR-tetA(A) (tetracycline resistance), strA/strB (streptomycin resistance), sul1 (sulphonamide resistance) and aadA2 (streptomycin/spectinomycin resistance), were located in this MDR region. PCR analysis revealed that the GI was not stable and could be excised from the chromosome as a circular intermediate. CONCLUSIONS: The floRv gene was identified in a porcine S. maltophilia isolate. Six resistance genes including floRv were located in a novel GI. As an opportunistic pathogen in animals and humans, S. maltophilia might act as a resistance gene reservoir in farm environments. Its contribution to the spread of resistance genes to other pathogens should be monitored.
