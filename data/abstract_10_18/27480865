Resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs) is a matter of considerable concern for public health. Here, we studied the spontaneous loss of an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-encoding plasmid from a rifampin-resistant Escherichia coli isolate orally inoculated into pigs under controlled conditions. Fecal samples were collected and cultured on rifampin-supplemented medium, and the resistance of the E. coli isolates to ESCs was studied by phenotypic tests, PCR detection of plasmid genes, and complete sequencing. The results showed that only 3 out of 353 rifampin-resistant E. coli isolates were ESC susceptible, and PCR and bioinformatics analysis confirmed the loss of the plasmid. These in vivo experiments indicate that the loss of an ESBL-encoding plasmid seems a rare event in gut microbiota.
