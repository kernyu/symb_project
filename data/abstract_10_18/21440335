Colistin (polymyxin E), an old antibiotic replaced by other less toxic antibiotics in the 1970s, has been increasingly used over the last decade due to multidrug-resistance in Gram-negative bacteria and lack of new antibiotics. However, there is a dearth of information on the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and toxicodynamics (TD) of colistin and its non-active prodrug colistimethate sodium (CMS). Optimised dose regimens have not been established for different types of patients. Additionally, most PK data available in the literature were obtained from concentrations derived from potentially misleading microbiological assays. Therefore, it is urgent to conduct prospective studies to optimise CMS/colistin use in patients, in particular the critically ill. This review summarises recent key clinical studies evaluating the efficacy, toxicity and PK/PD of colistin/CMS.
