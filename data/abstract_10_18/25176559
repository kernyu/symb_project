Halomonas sp. FS-N4 is a bacterium, which can grow in the medium Marine Broth 2216 with 5M initial hydrogen peroxide concentration, shows a strong oxidation resistance, and the crude enzyme activity can reach as high as 13.33katal/mg. We reported the draft genome sequence of H. sp. FS-N4, showing that it contains 3434 protein-coding genes, including the genes putatively involved in the response to the oxidative stress, among which a phytochrome-like gene might be a key point to survive in the environment with high concentration of hydrogen peroxide and exhibit high catalase activity.
