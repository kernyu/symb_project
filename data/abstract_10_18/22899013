In order to report pharmacological characterization of marine snail (Hexaplex trunculus) hepatopancreatic phospholipase A(2) (mSDPLA(2)), we have talked for the first time the antimicrobial activity against different pathogenic bacterial strains, anti-chlamydial activity as well as its cytotoxic activity against McCoy cell lines. mSDPLA(2), showed a high level of activity towards Gram-positive bacteria as Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Whereas Gram-negative bacteria, unfortunately, exhibited a higher resistance, mSDPLA(2) was also found to have a strong cytotoxic activity, causing significant morphological alterations of the McCoy cell lines surfaces and to be a hinder to the proliferation. Moreover, mSDPLA(2) proved to have a very potent anti-chlamydial activity. Over 95 % inhibition of chlamydial inclusions were obtained at a concentration of 10 mug/ml of mSDPLA(2) after 24 h postinfection. Interestingly, at a concentration of 10 mug/ml of mSDPLA(2), the proliferation of McCoy cells was not affected. Approximately 50 % inhibition of cell growth was obtained with a concentration of 37 mug/mL of mSDPLA(2). mSDPLA(2) could be considered as an excellent candidate for the development of a new anti-infective agent. This enzyme showed significant antimicrobial activities.
