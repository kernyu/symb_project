Many studies have reported the presence of antibiotic-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in environmental samples such as hospital wastewater and surface water. The present study evaluated the contribution of untreated hospital wastewater to the dissemination of resistant P. aeruginosa strains in aquatic environments, through the analysis of their antibiotic susceptibility profile and genetic similarity. Wastewater samples were collected from two hospitals located in Rio Grande do Sul, RS, Brazil. Superficial water samples were collected from water bodies that received this wastewater discharge. The antibiotic susceptibility profiles of the strains were determined using the disk-diffusion technique and their genotyping was done by amplification of the Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus sequences (ERIC-PCR). The antibiotic resistance was higher among the hospital wastewater strains and the multiresistant phenotype was also observed only among these strains. The ERIC-PCR profiles did not reveal any genetic similarity among the P. aeruginosa strains from the wastewater and superficial water samples. On the contrary, they showed that genetically distinct populations were established in these different environments and probably that some other contamination source could be contributing to the presence of resistant strains in these water bodies.
