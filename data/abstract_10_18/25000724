The effect of inorganic phosphate in the culture medium on microbial surface hydrophobicity, susceptibility to antibiotics and its autolytic activity has been investigated. The limitation of inorganic phosphate reduced affinity of bacterial cells to chloroform, ethyl acetate and hexane. The total elimination of inorganic phosphate caused an increase of the affinity of Lactobacillus plantarum strain 11/16 to hexane. Autolytic activity of the strain L. plantarum 195D did not depend on the concentration of inorganic phosphate, whereas its decrease reduced autolysis of the strain L. plantarum 11/16 by 15-20% Antibiotic susceptibility decrease of lactobacilli towards to the effect of fuzidin, furazolidone and rifampicin was shown. At the same time, limitation of inorganic phosphate source in the culture medium increased the antibiotic sensitivity towards ceftriaxone.
