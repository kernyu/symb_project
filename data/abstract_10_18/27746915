Infections arising from contaminated medical devices are a serious global issue, contributing to antibiotic resistance and imposing significant strain on healthcare systems. Since the majority of medical device-associated infections are biofilm related, efforts are being made to generate either bacteria-repellent or antibacterial coatings aimed at preventing bacterial colonisation. Here, we utilise a nanocapsule mediated slow release of a natural antimicrobial to improve the performance of a bacteria repellent polymer coating. Poly(lauryl acrylate) nanocapsules containing eugenol (4-allyl-2-methoxyphenol) were prepared and entrapped within a interpenetrating network designed to repel bacteria. When coated on a catheter and an endotracheal tube, this hemocompatible system allowed slow-release of eugenol, resulting in notable reduction in surface-bound Klebsiella pneumoniae and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
