OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of tenofovir (TDF) 300 mg/d, comparing with entecavir (ETV), in adults with chronic HBV infection who had previously virologic failure with lamivudine(LAM) and failed with rescue treatment of LAM combined adefovir(ADV). METHODS: Fifty-seven patients of chronic hepatitis B on rescue treatment with TDF were analyzed retrospectively. The serum HBV DNA levels, HBeAg, ALT and serum creatinine (Cr) were detected after treatment for 12, 24 and 48 weeks respectively. In addition, data of 40 cases treated with ETV 1 mg per day as a control group were also collected. RESULTS: The baseline characteristics including HBV viral loads, median age, serum levels of ALT and Cr were compatible between TDF group and ETV group. At the time point of 24 weeks, there was only one patient (2.5%) in ETV group with HBV DNA<100 IU/ml, which means negative viral replication, while 49 patients in TDF group reached HBV negativity (86.0% vs 2.5%, chi(2) = 22.26, P < 0.001). At the time point of 48 weeks, the proportion of patients with HBV DNA<100 IU/ml in TDF group was significantly higher than that in ETV group (87.7% vs 12.5%,chi(2) = 24.17, P < 0.001). The ratios of ALT normalization (84.2% vs 77.5%, P = 0.431) and HBeAg seroconversion were similar in both groups. Elevated Cr was not found in both cohorts at the end of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Tenofovir (300 mg/d) is an effective and safe rescue therapy in chronic hepatitis B patients who failed initial treatment with LAM and secondary treatment of LAM plus ADV.
