BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a major risk factor for skin and skin structure infection (SSSI), and the global burden of diabetics with SSSI is enormous. The more complex microbiology of diabetic foot infection (DFI) is well established, but it is not known whether microbiological etiology differs between diabetics and nondiabetics in other disease entities under the umbrella of complicated SSSI (cSSSI). METHODS: This retrospective, population-based study included patients with cSSSI, and it was conducted in 2 Nordic cities with a low prevalence of antimicrobial resistance. In analyses, patients (N = 460) were separated into 3 groups: diabetics (n = 119), nondiabetics (n = 271), and patients with DFI (n = 70). RESULTS: After exclusion of patients with DFI, there was no difference in the microbiological etiology or initial antimicrobial treatment of cSSSI between diabetics and nondiabetics. Gram-positive bacteria encountered 70% of isolations in diabetics and 69% in nondiabetics, and the empirical treatment covered initial pathogens in 81% and 86% of patients, respectively. However, diabetes was the only background characteristic in the propensity score-adjusted analysis associated with broad-spectrum antimicrobial use and longer antibiotic treatment duration. Patients with DFI had Gram-negative and polymicrobial infection more often than nondiabetics. CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that diabetics without DFI are not different in the causative agents of cSSSI, although they are more exposed to antimicrobial therapy of inappropriate extended spectrum and long duration. Broad-spectrum coverage was clearly needed only in DFI. A clear opportunity for antimicrobial stewardship was detected in the rapidly growing population of diabetic patients with cSSSI.
