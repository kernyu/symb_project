The aim of this study was comparison of the antimicrobial sensitivity and adhesive properties of E. coli strains isolated from urine and blood samples. This study included 169 of E. coli strains isolated in the Clinical Microbiology Department of dr. A. Jurasz University Hospital in 2003-2006. E. coli strains isolated from urine samples revealed statistically higher production of Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamases and multidrug resistance than strains isolated from blood samples. Stains isolated from the blood adhered to latex and PCV catheters more frequently when compared with strains isolated from urine.
