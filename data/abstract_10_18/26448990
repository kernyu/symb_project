There is lately observed an increase in the resistance of the main pathogens of urologic infection to beta-lactam antibiotics due to production of plasmid-induced beta-lactamases. The aim of the study was to reveal types TEM, SHV and CTX-M plasmid beta-lactamases among uropathogens. Out of 115 isolates, 30 (26.1%) strains produced beta-lactamases. Genes blaTEM and bla CTX-Mwere the most frequent. Most of the isolates were resistant to ampicillin (73.3%), ciprofloxacin (46.7%), levofloxacin (43.3%), gentamicin (40%). The betaLES-producing strains were susceptible to meropenem (96.7%), nitroxolin (83.3%), phosphomycin (70%), amikacin (70%). The presence of the resistance genes in the uropathogens was evident of a high rate of their distribution among them by the plasmids. Detection of the plasmid-induced beta-lactamases is important for the optimal choice of the antibiotic for empirical therapy.
