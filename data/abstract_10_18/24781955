The aim of this study was to examine Helicobacter pylori-resistance rate to different antibiotics: tetracycline, amoxicillin, clarithromycin and metronidazole, and to compare eradication rates in adults and children in Israel. The study was based on the hypothesis of high-resistance rates to clarithromycin and metronidazole especially in adults and overall low-resistance rates to tetracycline and amoxicillin. One seventy six biopsies from patients with dyspeptic symptoms were cultured of which 100 were from adults (19-79 years) and 76 from children (7-17 years). All positive cultures were examined by Epsilometer test for MIC determination against tetracycline, amoxicillin, clarithromycin and metronidazole. 48.3% (85 out of 176) were H. pylori positive, of which 44% were from adults and 54% from children. Antibiotic resistance was seen in 31 out of 44 (70.5%) for metronidazole, 1 out of 44 (2.3%) for amoxicillin, 10 out of 44 (22.3%) for clarithromycin and 1 out of 44 (2.3%) for tetracycline among adults. Antibiotic resistance was seen in 10 out of 41 (24.4%) for metronidazole, 5 out of 41 (12.2%) for amoxicillin, 10 out of 41 (24.4%) for clarithromycin and 1 out of 41 (2.4%) for tetracycline among children. High rates of H. pylori resistance to metronidazole and clarithromycin was found especially among adults. Therefore, to increase the success rate of anti-H. pylori treatment, other classes of antibiotics need to be considered.
