Urinary tract infections (UTI) are one of the most common infections in children and symptoms may be nonspecific. The risk of renal scarring is highest in children under 1 year of age with febrile UTI and high-grade vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Although treatment of UTI is usually straightforward, given increased rates of antimicrobial resistance worldwide, the choice of treatment for pediatric UTI should be guided by community resistance patterns whenever feasible. The benefit of antimicrobial prophylaxis after first UTI and/or in the presence of VUR remains controversial, but a recent meta-analysis supports continuous antimicrobial prophylaxis in children with VUR, indicating a need for more research in this area.
