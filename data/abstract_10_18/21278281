The mutation G143A in the inhibitor binding site of cytochrome b confers a high level of resistance to fungicides targeting the bc(1) complex. The mutation, reported in many plant-pathogenic fungi, has not evolved in fungi that harbor an intron immediately after the codon for G143 in the cytochrome b gene, intron bi2. Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism, we show here that a codon change from GGT to GCT, which replaces glycine 143 with alanine, hinders the splicing of bi2 by altering the exon/intron structure needed for efficient intron excision. This lowers the levels of cytochrome b and respiratory growth. We then investigated possible bypass mechanisms that would restore the respiratory fitness of a resistant mutant. Secondary mutations in the mitochondrial genome were found, including a point mutation in bi2 restoring the correct exon/intron structure and the deletion of intron bi2. We also found that overexpression of nuclear genes MRS2 and MRS3, encoding mitochondrial metal ion carriers, partially restores the respiratory growth of the G143A mutant. Interestingly, the MRS3 gene from the plant-pathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea, overexpressed in an S. cerevisiae G143A mutant, had a similar compensatory effect. These bypass mechanisms identified in yeast could potentially arise in pathogenic fungi.
