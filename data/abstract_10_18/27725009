The optimisation of antibiotic use to maximise patient care and safety through antibiotic stewardship forms one of the cornerstones of the global response to antibiotic resistance. Stewardship efforts in low- and middle-income countries are challenged by lack of healthcare professionals trained in infection. Therefore, in resource-poor settings, the traditional model of infection specialist-led stewardship may be impractical, requiring new models to be developed. A recent South African study across 47 Netcare hospitals nationally highlighted the role of pharmacists in this regard, proving that non-specialised pharmacists can drive a prospective audit, feedback collaborative strategy and a range of improvement science principles to reduce antibiotic consumption by the same levels as that documented in high-resource, infection specialist-led stewardship programmes. This editorial discusses the hidden opportunities to engage non-infection specialists in programmes to combat antibiotic resistance, expanding the cadres of healthcare professionals to lead stewardship programmes.
