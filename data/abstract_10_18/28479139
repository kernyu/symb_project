INTRODUCTION: Implementation of the breakpoints established in the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) guidelines in comparison with those of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) means that the criteria for interpreting the susceptibility of some antimicrobials have been modified, resulting in changes in the reports of accumulated antibiotic susceptibility. METHODS: The effect of applying EUCAST breakpoints in 10,359 clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp. was analysed. RESULTS: By applying EUCAST breakpoints, most antimicrobial susceptibility percentages did not change or changed very slightly. However, a decrease in aminoglycoside susceptibility was observed in Gram-negative bacilli, mainly for amikacin and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (23.2%), although only 5.7% were completely resistant; a notably decrease in the percentage of isolates susceptible to aztreonam was also observed. There was also a marked increase in the number of Staphylococcus aureus strains resistant to clindamycin (51.5%) and aminoglycosides (gentamicin 43.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Switching from CLSI to EUCAST criteria in some pathogens alters the percentages of resistance to several antimicrobials, and therefore the local epidemiology of the resistance. These changes should be implemented by a multidisciplinary group in order to analyse the influence of the new data on the empirical treatment protocols of each centre.
