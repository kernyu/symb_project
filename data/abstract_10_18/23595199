A 67-year-old gentleman developed persistent Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteraemia following transjugular intrahepatic portal shunting. 'Endotipsitis' was diagnosed. Conventional therapy with a vancomycin infusion, amikacin and rifampicin failed after 17 days. He was cured with a 6-week course of high-dose (8 mg/kg) daptomycin monotherapy.
