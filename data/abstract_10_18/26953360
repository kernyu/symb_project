A novel theranostic divalent vancomycin analog using a planar 1,8-diazapyrene moiety as a rigid scaffold exhibits potent and selective antibacterial activity against Gram (+) bacteria including vancomycin-resistant strains, while having minimal influence on Gram (-) bacteria and mammalian cells. Moreover, this theranostic analog can be also applied for selective two-photon fluorescence imaging of Gram (+) bacteria.
