INTRODUCTION: Apart from individual small-scale outbreaks, infections with vancomycin-resistant enterococci are uncommon in Hong Kong. A major outbreak of vancomycin-resistant enterococci, however, occurred at a large tertiary hospital in 2013. We describe the successful control of this outbreak and share the lessons learned. METHODS: In 2013, there was an abnormal increase in the incidence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci carriage compared with baseline in multiple clinical departments at Queen Elizabeth Hospital. A multipronged approach was adopted that included a 10-week hospital-wide active screening programme, which aimed to identify and isolate hidden vancomycin-resistant enterococci carriers among all in-patients. The identified carriers were completely segregated in designated wards where applicable. Other critical infection control measures included directly observed hand hygiene and environmental hygiene. A transparent and open disclosure approach was adopted throughout the outbreak. RESULTS: The infection control measures were successfully implemented. The active screening of vancomycin-resistant enterococci was conducted between 30 September and 10 November 2013. A total of 7053 rectal swabs were collected from patients in 46 hospital wards from 11 departments. The overall carriage rate of vancomycin-resistant enterococci was 2.8% (201/7053). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed a predominant outbreak clone. We curbed the outbreak and kept the colonisation of vancomycin-resistant enterococci among patients at a pre-upsurge low level. CONCLUSIONS: We report the largest cohesive effort to control spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in Hong Kong. Coupled with other infection control measures, we successfully controlled vancomycin-resistant enterococci to the pre-outbreak level. We have demonstrated that the monumental tasks can be achieved with meticulous planning, and thorough communication and understanding between all stakeholders.
