The antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a group of unique naturally occurring anti-microbial compounds with around 50 amino acids. It represents promising therapeutic agents to the infectious disease without concerning about drug resistance. However, commercial development of these peptides for even the simplest application has been hindered by the limitations of sources, instability, toxicity and bioavailability. To improve the properties of the artificial synthesized AMPs, the modification and design are the hotspots of the AMPs research. In fact, more than half of the known AMPs are naturally modified. In this review, two types of modification strategies, biochemical modification and chemical modification were summarized. Although, the chemical modification is versatile and direct, the manufacturing cost is greatly increased compared to the antibiotics. With the recent progress of the protein modification enzyme, the biochemical modification of the antimicrobial peptide followed by heterologous expression has great application prospects.
