In total, 363 Escherichia coli were isolated from 165 faecal samples of healthy buffaloes in West Bengal, India. Twenty-four of these isolates (6.61%) were found to carry at least one gene characteristic for Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC). These STEC strains belonged to 13 different O-serogroups. The stx1 gene was present in 23 (95.8%) of total STEC isolates, whereas 20 (83.3%) STEC isolates carried the gene stx2. Twelve strains of E. coli (50% of total STEC isolates) possessed enterohaemolysin (ehxA) gene in combination with others. Fourteen (58.33%) isolates found to possess saa gene. However, no E. coli was detected harbouring gene for intimin protein (eaeA). Of 23 stx1 -positive isolates, seven (30.43%) were positive for genes of the stx1C subtype. Of the 20 isolates with the stx2 gene, 25% (5/20) possessed stx2C and 10% (2/20) possessed stx2d gene. The phylogenetic analysis after RAPD of STEC strains revealed six major clusters. The isolated STEC strains were resistant most frequently to erythromycin (95.83%), cephalothin (62.5%), amikacin (54.17%), kanamycin (45.83%) and gentamicin (41.67%) group of antibiotics. No ESBL-producing (blaCTXM , blaTEM , blaSHV ) or quinolone resistance gene (qnrA) was detected in the STEC isolates.
