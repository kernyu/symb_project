BACKGROUND/AIMS: We evaluated the trend in the rates of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) over time, as well as the difference in the drug-resistance pattern between pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) at a private referral center in South Korea. METHODS: All patients with culture-confirmed TB from 2006 to 2013 were included. RESULTS: In total, 1,745 patients were included: 1,431 (82.0%) were new cases, and 314 (18.0%) were cases treated previously; 1,610 (92.3%) were diagnosed with PTB, and 135 (7.7%) were diagnosed with EPTB. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB were detected in 5.8% and 2.0% of new cases and in 20.1% and 8.6% of previously treated cases, respectively. The MDR TB rate during the study period decreased remarkably, whereas the MDR and XDR TB rates decreased significantly in previously treated cases. No difference in the drug-resistance rate was detected between PTB and EPTB. CONCLUSIONS: The TB drug-resistance rate, particularly that of MDR TB, remained high at a private referral hospital, and the drug-resistance rate did not decrease significantly from 2006 to 2013. This finding underscores the need for a national survey regarding the prevalence of drug-resistant TB to obtain the most accurate and current drug-resistance status in South Korea, including the private sector.
