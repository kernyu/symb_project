We report the isolation of a novel agent of subcutaneous mycosis from a 45-year-old Indian male immigrant in the United States. Phylogenetic analysis of partial small ribosomal subunit and large ribosomal subunit, internal transcribed spacer, partial translation elongation factor (TEF1), and RNA polymerase second largest subunit (rPB2) loci revealed that the strain was identical to another isolate previously reported as "Madurella mycetomatis." Both strains clustered in the order Pleosporales, nested in the family Arthopyreniaceae/Roussoellaceae. The fungus differed from known species and hence a new taxon, Roussoella percutanea, is introduced, typified by a strain that showed delayed production of pycnidial conidiomata. Antifungal susceptibility testing suggested that the new species is resistant to echinocandins and flucytosine, with variable results with azoles and amphotericin B.
