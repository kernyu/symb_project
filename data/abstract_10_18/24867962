Antibiotics that are excreted into the intestinal tract may disrupt the indigenous intestinal microbiota and promote colonization by health care-associated pathogens. beta-Lactam, or penicillin-type, antibiotics are among the most widely utilized antibiotics worldwide and may also adversely affect the microbiota. Many bacteria are capable, however, of producing beta-lactamase enzymes that inactivate beta-lactam antibiotics. We hypothesized that prior establishment of intestinal colonization with a beta-lactamase-producing anaerobe might prevent these adverse effects of beta-lactam antibiotics, by inactivating the portion of antibiotic that is excreted into the intestinal tract. Here, mice with a previously abolished microbiota received either oral normal saline or an oral cephalosporinase-producing strain of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron for 3 days. Mice then received 3 days of subcutaneous ceftriaxone, followed by either oral administration of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) or sacrifice and assessment of in vitro growth of epidemic and nonepidemic strains of Clostridium difficile in murine cecal contents. Stool concentrations of VRE and ceftriaxone were measured, cecal levels of C. difficile 24 h after incubation were quantified, and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of microbial 16S rRNA genes was performed to evaluate the antibiotic effect on the microbiota. The results demonstrated that establishment of prior colonization with a beta-lactamase-producing intestinal anaerobe inactivated intraintestinal ceftriaxone during treatment with this antibiotic, allowed recovery of the normal microbiota despite systemic ceftriaxone, and prevented overgrowth with VRE and epidemic and nonepidemic strains of C. difficile in mice. These findings describe a novel probiotic strategy to potentially prevent pathogen colonization in hospitalized patients.
