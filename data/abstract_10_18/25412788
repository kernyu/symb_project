Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic, progressive, inflammatory spondyloarthropathy that affects approximately one-third of patients with all types of psoriasis. Dermatologists are in a unique position to recognize early symptoms of PsA, initiate appropriate therapy, and prevent development of further disability. The course of PsA can be modulated by immunosuppressive therapy; patients with moderate-to-severe disease require aggressive management with medications proven to halt disease progression. It is essential for the dermatologist to understand the safety, tolerability, efficacy, cost, and potential to halt disease progression with available medications for this relatively common and potentially disabling disease.
