Two new indolo[3,2-a]carbazoles (1, 2) were isolated from a deep-water collection of a sponge of the genus Asteropus. The structures of 1 and 2 were determined through the analysis of spectroscopic data including mass spectrometry and 2D-NMR. Compound 1 showed minimum inhibitory concentrations of 25 mug/mL against the fungal pathogen Candida albicans and 50 mug/mL against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Compounds 1 and 2 showed no cytotoxicity against the PANC1 human pancreatic carcinoma and NCI/ADR-RES ovarian adenocarcinoma cell lines at our standard test concentration of 5 mug/mL.
