Multiplex PCR was applied to explore the antimicrobial-resistance profiles of 145 gonococci isolated from Bangrak Hospital, Thailand in 2007. All isolates were clearly identified for the plasmid-mediated resistant types of penicillin (Asia, Africa and Toronto) and tetracycline (American and Dutch). This method can also predict the decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin by detection of Ser-91 mutation. Prevalence rates of penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae (PPNG) and high-level tetracycline-resistance N. gonorrhoeae (TRNG) were shown to be high as 82.1% and 84.1%, respectively. Most PPNG carried the Africa-type (78.2%) while the American-type (61.8%) was harboured in most TRNG. Mono- and triple-resistance patterns were presented in 2.6% and 79.5% of male, 20.7% and 62.1% of men who have sex with men (MSM), 0% and 75.0% of female, and 10% and 70% of female sex workers (FSW). Additionally, the rate of the Dutch type was high in patients among the age of 35-44 years (57.1%) and female patients (43.8%). The changing types of plasmids have been noticed during the time period of study. The multi-resistance patterns of the gonococcal isolates can be used as an epidemiological index of gonorrhoea and human sexual behaviours. This information will support the management of individual patients as well as the public health surveillance.
