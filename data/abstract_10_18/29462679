The aim of the present study was to develop a novel pH sensitive gelatin methacrylate hydrogel for the controlled delivery of Gentamicin (GS) and Ampicillin (Amp). GS and Amp having synergistic activity is effective in killing multi drug resistant bacteria. The hydrogel was well characterized using FTIR, XRD and SEM techniques. The drug loading and encapsulation efficiency were found to be 85.0 and 77.0% for GS, 79.0 and 88.0% for Amp, respectively. The in vitro swelling, degradation and release profiles suggest the pH dependent behaviour of hydrogel. DPPH Assay confirmed the role of 2-amino guanidine in nullifying the side effect of GS and inhibition percentage of DDLHG is found to be 85.0%. Antimicrobial studies revealed the increased efficiency of the drug combination in killing bacteria.
