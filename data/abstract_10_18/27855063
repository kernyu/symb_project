The mechanisms underlying bacterial tolerance to antibiotics are unclear. A possible adaptation strategy was explored by exposure of drug-naive methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus strain FDA209P to vancomycin in vitro Strains surviving vancomycin treatment (vancomycin survivor strains), which appeared after 96 h of exposure, were slow-growing derivatives of the parent strain. Although the vancomycin MICs for the survivor strains were within the susceptible range, the cytokilling effects of vancomycin at 20-fold the MIC were significantly lower for the survivor strains than for the parent strain. Whole-genome sequencing demonstrated that ileS, encoding isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS), was mutated in two of the three vancomycin survivor strains. The IleRS Y723H mutation is located close to the isoleucyl-tRNA contact site and potentially affects the affinity of IleRS binding to isoleucyl-tRNA, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis and leading to vancomycin tolerance. Introduction of the mutation encoding IleRS Y723H into FDA209P by allelic replacement successfully transferred the vancomycin tolerance phenotype. We have identified mutation of ileS to be one of the bona fide genetic events leading to the acquisition of vancomycin tolerance in S. aureus, potentially acting via inhibition of the function of IleRS.
