GS-9190 is a NS5B non-nucleoside analogue with demonstrated effectiveness in a Phase 1 monotherapy study and in combination with other DAAs for treatment of chronic HCV infection. Here, the resistance profile of GS-9190 monotherapy in a Phase 1b study was investigated. Resistance analysis was performed by population sequencing and allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR) for Y448H with an assay cut-off of 0.5%. Phenotypic susceptibility analyses were performed on patient isolates as well as site-directed mutagenesis of mutations selected during monotherapy. No resistance-associated variants were observed in patients before or after receiving single doses of GS-9190 by population sequencing. In contrast, in patients who received GS-9190 for 8 days, mutations Y448H and Y452H in NS5B were observed by population sequencing in 21/36 (58%) and 2/36 (5.6%) patients, respectively, at Day 8 or Day 14. Among the remaining 15 patients who had no detectable Y448H at Day 8 or Day 14 by population sequencing, low frequencies of Y448H ranging from 1.3 to 9.7% were detected in 14 of 15 patients by AS-PCR. By AS-PCR, Y448H remained detectable at reduced frequency in the majority of patients analysed through 4-6 months of follow-up. Chimeric HCV replicons constructed with the NS5B sequence from patients with Y448H and Y448H + Y452H/Y demonstrated 27-fold and 78.5-fold reduced susceptibility to GS-9190. In conclusion, Y448H was rapidly selected in the majority of patients receiving multiple doses of GS-9190 as monotherapy, despite undetectable levels in pretreatment samples. Y448H confers reduced susceptibility to GS-9190 and other NNIs and persisted in most patients for months post-treatment.
