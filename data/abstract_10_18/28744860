OBJECTIVES: Echinocandins are the newest addition of the last decade to the antifungal armamentarium, which, owing to their unique mechanism of action, selectively target the fungal cells without affecting mammalian cells. Since the time of their introduction, they have come to occupy an important niche in the antifungal pharmacotherapy, due to their efficacy, safety, tolerability and favourable pharmacokinetic profiles. This review deals with the varying facets of echinocandins such as their chemistry, in-vitro and in-vivo evaluations, clinical utility and indications, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, and pharmacoeconomic considerations. KEY FINDINGS: Clinical studies have demonstrated that the echinocandins - caspofungin, micafungin and anidulafungin - are equivalent, if not superior, to the mainstay antifungal therapies involving amphotericin B and fluconazole. Moreover, echinocandin regimen has been shown to be more cost-effective and economical. Hence, the echinocandins have found favour in the management of invasive systemic fungal infections. CONCLUSIONS: The subtle differences in echinocandins with respect to their pharmacology, clinical therapy and the mechanisms of resistance are emerging at a rapid pace from the current pool of research which could potentially aid in extending their utility in the fungal infections of the eye, heart and nervous system.
