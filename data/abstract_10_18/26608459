Silicone and Dacron are used in a wide spectrum of implantable and indwelling medical products. They elicit a foreign body response, which results in a chronic inflammatory environment and collagenous encapsulation of the medical device that compromises the immune system's ability to effectively fight infections at the biomaterial surface. The objective of this work is to evaluate a novel process to modify silicone and Dacron with a bioactive collagen surface coupled to a gentamicin impregnated hydrogel graft and assess the surface's cytocompatibility and infection resistance properties. Samples of silicone and polyethylene terephthalate (Dacron velour) were modified by plasma deposition and activation followed by a co-polymer acrylic acid (AA)/acrylamide (AAm) hydrogel graft and covalent immobilization of a bioactive collagen surface. The modified surfaces were characterized using FTIR, contact angle, staining, SEM, and XPS. The poly (AA-AAm) hydrogel was impregnated with gentamicin and tested for controlled release characteristics. Each modified surface was evaluated for its ability to resist infection and to promote normal healing as measured by bacterial growth inhibition (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) in both broth and agar conditions as well as using fluorescence microscopy to observe adherence of 3T3-NIH fibroblasts. The addition of the poly (AA-AAm) hydrogel with gentamicin inhibited bacterial growth and the subsequent addition of the collagen surface promoted robust fibroblast adhesion on both silicone and Dacron materials. Thorough surface characterization and in vitro bacterial and fibroblast evaluation results suggest that this novel surface bioengineering process generated a highly effective surface on silicone and Dacron with the potential to reduce infection and promote healing.
