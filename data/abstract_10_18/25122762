Oxidative folding of (pro)insulin is crucial for its assembly and biological function. This process takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is accomplished by protein disulfide isomerase and ER oxidoreductin 1beta, generating stoichiometric amounts of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as byproduct. During insulin resistance in the prediabetic state, increased insulin biosynthesis can overwhelm the ER antioxidative and folding capacity, causing an imbalance in the ER redox homeostasis and oxidative stress. Peroxiredoxin 4 (Prdx4), an ER-specific antioxidative peroxidase can utilize luminal H2O2 as driving force for reoxidizing protein disulfide isomerase family members, thus efficiently contributing to disulfide bond formation. Here, we examined the functional significance of Prdx4 on beta-cell function with emphasis on insulin content and secretion during stimulation with nutrient secretagogues. Overexpression of Prdx4 in glucose-responsive insulin-secreting INS-1E cells significantly metabolized luminal H2O2 and improved the glucose-induced insulin secretion, which was accompanied by the enhanced proinsulin mRNA transcription and insulin content. This beta-cell beneficial effect was also observed upon stimulation with the nutrient insulin secretagogue combination of leucine plus glutamine, indicating that the effect is not restricted to glucose. However, knockdown of Prdx4 had no impact on H2O2 metabolism or beta-cell function due to the fact that Prdx4 expression is negligibly low in pancreatic beta-cells. Moreover, we provide evidence that the constitutively low expression of Prdx4 is highly susceptible to hyperoxidation in the presence of high glucose. Overall, these data suggest an important role of Prdx4 in maintaining insulin levels and improving the ER folding capacity also under conditions of a high insulin requirement.
