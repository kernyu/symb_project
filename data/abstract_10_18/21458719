The present article is an update of the literature on fungemia in onco-hematologic patients. A multidisciplinary group of Spanish physicians with an interest in this field selected the most important papers published lately. Papers from the fields of epidemiology, risk factors, pathogenesis, diagnosis, outcome, prevention and treatment are discussed. Important aspects of these studies include the assessment of different strategies in the management of fever in neutropenic patients. Moreover, early identification of patients at risk of fungal infections, as well as identification of patients at risk for fluconazole-resistant strains are topics of increasing interest.
