Recent developments and novel research strategies are adopted widely to discover and develop the new drugs to treat tuberculosis. New antitubercular drugs are urgently needed because tuberculosis remains a global health problem as around nine million new cases are estimated each year with almost two million fatalities. It states the impact and outcomes that have made a significant effect in antitubercular drug development. We are presenting current status of tuberculosis, antitubercular drug development, novel molecular targets, novel agents in clinical and pre-clinical development and some efforts that are being made in the development of novel molecules based on different pharmacophores as lead compounds and recent strategies.
