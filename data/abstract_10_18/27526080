The increasing number of infections caused by multidrug-resistant and pandrug-resistant bacteria represents a serious worlwide problem. Drug resistance limits available antimicrobials and can lead to suboptimal treatment of bacterial infections. It can be predicted that resistance to more antimicrobial drugs will be acquired by even more bacteria in the future. Among the distinct resistance strategies, preventing drug entrance to intracellular compartment through modification of membrane permeability (bacterial influx) and active export of compounds to the external environment (bacterial efflux) are of particular importance as they limit the interaction of the drug with its intracellular targets and, consequently, its deleterious effects on the cell. Several current studies have extended our understanding of drug resistance mechanisms associated with altered membrane permeability in gram-negative bacteria. In this study, we propose a summary of resistance mechanisms associated with transport of drugs across bacterial cell envelope exploited by Klebsiella pneumoniae, one of the most common nosocomial infection-causing pathogens. The better understanding of molecular bases of drug transport in/out of the single cell may have consequence for success in antimicrobial therapy of infection caused by drug-resistant Klebsiella.
