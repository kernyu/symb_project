BACKGROUND AND AIM: Autoimmune disorders (AID) have been shown to be associated with chronic antibiotic-refractory pouchitis (CARP). The role of anti-microsomal antibodies in ileal pouch disorders has not been investigated. The aims of the study were to investigate the prevalence of positive anti-microsomal antibody in symptomatic patients with ileal pouches and to investigate its clinical implications. METHODS: A total of 118 consecutive symptomatic patients with ileal pouches were included between January and October 2010. Anti-microsomal antibodies were measured at the time of presentation. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics were compared between patients with positive and negative anti-microsomal antibody. RESULTS: There were 14 patients (11.9%) with positive serum anti-microsomal antibody. The mean age of patients in the antibody positive and negative groups were 41.8 +/- 14.4 and 42.0 +/- 14.0 years, respectively (p = 0.189). All 14 patients in the antibody positive group (100%) had some form of AID, as compared to 20 patients (19.2%) in the antibody negative group (p < 0.001). Four (28.6%) patients in the antibody positive group had at least one AID in addition to Hashimoto's thyroiditis in contrast to four (3.8%) in the antibody negative group (p = 0.003). In addition, five (35.7%) patients had associated primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) in the antibody positive group compared to nine (8.7%) in the antibody negative group (p = 0.012). Eleven patients (78.6%) in the antibody positive group required steroids for treatment of pouch related symptoms in contrast to 26/104 (25%) patients in the antibody negative group (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Anti-microsomal antibodies were common in pouch patients presenting with symptoms. Patients with positive anti-microsomal antibodies were much more likely to have concurrent AID and PSC. These patients were more likely to require therapy with steroids.
