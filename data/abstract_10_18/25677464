BACKGROUND: The optimal management of Mycobacterium chelonae disease in immunocompromised patients remains unclear. A combination of antimicrobial agents is recommended as monotherapy with clarithromycin has been associated with clinical failures due to acquired resistance. OBJECTIVES: We aim to report the efficacy and tolerability of linezolid in association with clarithromycin for the treatment of M. chelonae infections in immunocompromised patients. METHODS: We describe four immunocompromised patients treated by linezolid and clarithromycin for cutaneous M. chelonae disease. RESULTS: This combination was associated with rapid clinical efficacy in all patients with no relapse observed after a median follow-up of 2.25 years (1.4 years). However, this treatment was responsible for frequent adverse events including thrombocytopaenia, myalgia and mitochondrial toxicity. All adverse effects were reversible after linezolid discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: We therefore suggest linezolid/clarithromycin combination as the initial therapeutic strategy for M. chelonae skin infections in immunocompromised patients.
