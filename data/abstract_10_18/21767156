BACKGROUND: The Surgical Infection Society Guidelines for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) were published in October 2009 in Surgical Infections, and an overview of these guidelines was provided at the Thirtieth Annual Meeting of the Society. A summary of this overview is provided. METHODS: Review of relevant papers related to complicated SSTIs published between 1966 and 2008 with graded recommendations and summations of general epidemiology and recommendations. RESULTS: The frequency of SSTI has increased over the past decade, predominately because of an increase in infections caused by community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Drug resistance is increasing among all pathogens. A total of 61 graded recommendations were made in the complete guidelines, 28 of which are presented here, separated into those for non-necrotizing and necrotizing infections. CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be provided in complicated SSTIs. Early diagnosis and treatment of necrotizing infections is paramount, as time to therapy alters morbidity and mortality rates.
