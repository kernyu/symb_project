The aim of this study was to evaluate the use for HIV-1 drug resistance testing dried blood spots collected in remote areas and sent under field conditions to a reference laboratory and also to document virological failure in patients with suspected treatment failure. Samples were collected from patients receiving first line ART at 11 hospital sites around country, kept at room temperature (<37 degrees C) and sent within 15 days maximum to the reference laboratory. Viral nucleic acids were obtained by magnetic extraction with NucliSENS (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). Genotyping of HIV-1 pol gene was performed using the ANRS protocol. Drug resistance mutations were analyzed according to the Stanford University HIV database version 6.0.8. Two hundred thirty one HIV-infected adults' on HAART first line regimen composed study population. The median time on ART was 18 months (range 6-68). Regardless of the treatment duration, the overall rate of virological failure (VL >/= 3 log10 cp/ml) was 23.8% (n = 55/231). HIV genotypes were obtained successfully in 94.5% (n = 52/55). Drug resistance mutation was found in 41/52 patients in virological failure, for 17.7% (n = 41/231) an overall rate of drug resistance mutations. M184V/I was the most frequent mutation occurring, followed by K103N. Phylogenetic analysis of the 52 genotyped viral isolates showed the predominance of CRF02_AG with 62% (n = 32/52). Use of a DBS specimen is suitable to assist national programs for monitoring in remote areas HIV drug resistance in resources limited-settings.
