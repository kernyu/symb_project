Enterococci are responsible for various community- and hospital-acquired infections. Glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin) are active against these microorganisms by inhibiting cell wall synthesis through binding to cell wall precursors. Enterococcus faecium has developed multidrug resistance, including resistance to glycopeptides. Resistance to glycopeptides is due to the acquisition of an operon of genes cooperating to synthesize precursors devoid of affinity for the glycopeptides. Outbreaks were recently reported in hospital settings. These outbreaks were due to E. faecium isolates belonging to an hospital-adapted clonal complex (CC17) characterized by high level resistance to ampicillin and fluoroquinolones and frequently containing virulence factors. Outbreaks may be controlled by appropriate measures and new antibiotics are available in therapy. However, spreading of clonal strains adapted to hospitals require close surveillance.
