During the past decades, rates of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and carbapenem-resistant (CR) Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates, mainly Klebsiella spp., Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp. and Serratia marcescens, have increased, considerably restricting effective antimicrobial treatments. Tigecycline, the first member of the glycylcyclines, has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of complicated skin and soft-tissue, complicated intra-abdominal and community-acquired bacterial respiratory infections and is increasingly administered against MDR Enterobacteriaceae. Although resistance has gradually appeared, tigecycline still remains relatively active among Enterobacteriaceae, with resistance rates largely <10% in most wide-scale surveillance studies. Tigecycline resistance has been reported in some studies to be elevated among extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing, MDR, extensively drug-resistant and CR isolates. Broth microdilution (BMD) is the reference method for tigecycline susceptibility testing, but disagreements have been reported between the methods applied for routine tigecycline susceptibility testing. Therefore, confirmation of daily tigecycline susceptibility testing with BMD appears important in order to avoid misclassification of isolates. Various mechanisms have been reported to confer tigecycline resistance, with RND-type transporters, mainly the AcrAB efflux pump, playing an important role. Other pumps and various control pathways are also implicated in tigecycline resistance. Overall, tigecycline is a potent therapeutic option for enterobacterial infections. Accurate detection of tigecycline susceptibility status and surveillance of resistant organisms in the hospital environment is necessary in order to optimise its use and to preserve tigecycline in our therapeutic arsenal.
