INTRODUCTION: Invasive disease as a result Campylobacter spp. is rarely reported. Bloodstream infections have been reported in patients with immune deficiency or other serious underlying conditions. We conducted a prospective study to know the incidence of Campylobacter jejuni bacteremia in pediatric patients and its susceptibility to erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. METHODS: The identification of Campylobacter isolates was based on routine culture methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility was performed using a disk diffusion method. RESULTS: During April 2010-June 2012, at Hospital Nino Jesus of Madrid, Campylobacter spp. was isolated from 171 stool specimens in 154 patients. The median age was 2 years (3 months-21 year). One hundred and one (66%) isolates were identified as C. jejuni. Nine patients with enteritis due C. jejuni (9%) were immunocompromised. Erythromycin resistance was observed in 5% of the isolates. The resistance to ciprofloxacin was 88%. Blood cultures were obtained of 19 patients infected with C. jejuni (19%). Of these, one had C. jejuni bacteremia. During the study period, other episode of C. jejuni bacteremia was detected in one patient different without positive stool culture for C. jejuni (0.34% of all bloodstreams infections). Both patients were immunocompromised. CONCLUSIONS: Campylobacter spp. is an uncommon cause of bloodstream infection in our serie occurring in pediatric patients with immune deficiency as predisposing factor. In our institution, empirical use of fluoroquinolones for Campylobacter infections should not be recommended by the high rate of resistance. Moreover in our study the resistance to erythromycin is low, however is advisable its surveillance.
