The FilmArray (FA) is a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based desktop microbial detection system. The Blood Culture Identification (BCID) panel is an adaptable panel for the FA, which diagnoses sepsis or/and systemic infections by detecting 14 bacterial species, 4 bacterial genera, 1 bacterial family, 5 yeast species, and 3 antimicrobial resistance genes (mecA, KPC, and vanA/B) from positive blood cultures within 1 hour. We retrospectively evaluated the FA-BCID panel, using 54 positive blood cultures, from which 57 bacteria and 3 yeasts were identified through matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis. The FA-BCID panel revealed 59 microorganisms from 53 samples, which was similar the results of MALDI-TOF MS analysis; however, 1 bacterium from 1 sample was not detected. In addition, MecA genes were detected in 12 Staphylococcus species, which all displayed methicillin resistance on susceptibility testing, while KPC and vanA/B genes were not detected, which was consistent with the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Although more information on antimicrobial resistance, including activity of IMP-metallo-beta-lactamases, is required in Japan, the FA-BCID panel can detect pathogenic microorganisms in positive blood cultures rapidly, which could be beneficial for appropriate treatment of sepsis or/and systemic infections, especially in small hospitals.
