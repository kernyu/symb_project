Brincidofovir (BCV) is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent active in vitro against double-stranded DNA viruses including herpesviruses, adenoviruses, polyomaviruses, and poxviruses. We report successful BCV use in management of disseminated acyclovir- and cidofovir-resistant varicella zoster virus in an immunocompromised hematopoietic stem cell transplant patient with chronic graft-versus-host disease who was intolerant to foscarnet.
