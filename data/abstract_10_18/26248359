This study aimed to explore any mutation in the CYP51 gene conferring azole resistance in Aspergillus flavus. Two voriconazole-resistant and 45 voriconazole-susceptible isolates were included in the study. Sequence analysis demonstrated a T1025C nucleotide change in CYP51C, resulting in the Y319H amino acid substitution in one resistant isolate. However, the earlier described T788G mutation in CYP51C conferring voriconazole resistance in A. flavus isolates was present in all isolates, irrespective of their susceptibility status.
