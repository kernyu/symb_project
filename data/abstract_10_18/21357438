Asbestos causes malignant tumors such as lung cancer and malignant mesothelioma (MM). To determine whether asbestos exposure causes reduction of antitumor immunity, we established an in vitro T-cell line model of low-dose and continuous exposure to asbestos using an human adult T-cell leukemia virus-1 immortalized human polyclonal T-cell line, MT-2, and revealed that MT-2 cells exposed continuously to asbestos showed resistance to asbestos-induced apoptosis. In addition, the cells presented reduction of surface CXCR3 chemokine receptor expression and IFN-gamma production. In this study, to confirm that these findings are suitable for clinical translation, surface CXCR3 and IFN-gamma expression were analyzed using freshly isolated human CD4(+) T cells derived from healthy donors and patients with pleural plaque (PP) or MM. The results revealed that CXCR3 and IFN-gamma expression in the ex vivo model were reduced in some cases. Additionally, CXCR3 expression in CD4(+) T cells from PPs and MMs was significantly reduced compared with that from healthy donors, and CD4(+) T cells from patients with MMs exhibited a marked reduction in IFN-gamma mRNA levels after stimulation in vitro. Moreover, CD4(+)CXCR3(+) T cells in lymphocytes from MMs showed a tendency for an inverse correlation with its ligand CXCL10/IP10 in plasma. These findings show reduction of antitumor immune function in asbestos-exposed patients and indicate that CXCR3, IFN-gamma, and CXCL10/IP10 may be candidates to detect and monitor disease status.
