The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary chitooligosaccharides (COS) supplementation on the innate immune response and protection against Vibrio harveyi infection in Trachinotus ovatus. A basal diet was supplemented with 0.0 (control), 2.0, 4.0 and 6.0 g COS kg(-1) to formulate four experimental diets. Each diet was randomly allocated to triplicate groups of fi sh in fl oating sea cages (1.5 x 1.0 x 2.0 m), and each cage was stocked with 80 fi sh (initial average weight 10.8 +/- 0.05 g). After 8 weeks of feeding trial, Both the final weight and specific growth rate (SGR) signi fi cantly increased with increasing dietary COS levels up to 4.0 g kg(-1), whereas there were no signi fi cant differences for COS levels from 4.0 to 6.0 g kg(-1). A decreased feed conversion ratio (FCR) was observed with increasing dietary COS levels. The total leukocyte counts (WBC), differential leukocyte counts, respiratory burst activity, lysozyme and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were signi fi cantly increased with the increased levels of dietary COS (P < 0.05), and reached a maximum at level of 4.0 g kg(-1) COS. There were no signi fi cant differences in those immunological parameters between 4.0 and 6.0 g kg(-1) COS. Moreover, the dietary COS supplementation groups also exhibited a decrease in the cumulative symptom rates compared to the controls when challenged with V. harveyi. These results indicated that dietary intake containing COS could enhance the immune responses of fish and improve its resistance to infection by V. harveyi. Especially supplementation with 4.0 g kg(-1) COS to the fish for 56 days showed considerable improvement in the growth, survival and immune response of the fish.
