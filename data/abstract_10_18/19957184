Staphylococcus aureus is one of the major causes of mastitis in dairy animals and its resistance against multiple antimicrobials always remains crucial concern. Present investigation was carried out to detect the distribution of antibiotic-resistant genes of S. aureus isolates. Isolates (128) of S. aureus from mastitic milk were collected, tested for antibiotics with disc-diffusion method, and resistant genes mecA, linA, msrA msrB, vatA, vatB, vatC ermA, ermC tetK, tetM and aacA-D were detected by PCR. The phenotypic antibiotics resistance percent in S. aureus isolates was classified as tetracycline (36.7), gentamycin (30.5), streptomycin (26.6), kanamycin (25.8) and penicillin G (22.7). All the isolates were susceptible to vancomycin. Among isolates, 10.2% were observed as methicillin-resistant. The distribution of antibiotic-resistant genes was linA (51.6) followed by msrB (46.1), tetK + M (34.4), msrA and aacA-D (26.6%). Different antibiotic-resistant genes combinations (mecA/linA-2; mecA/aacA-D/tetK/linA/msrB-3; mecA/linA/msrA/msrB-3; aacA-D/linA/msrA/msrB-4; aacA-D/linA/msrB-7; linA/msrA/msrB-10; tetK/linA/msrA/msrB-11; aacA/tetK/linA/msrB-12 isolates) were observed. All the isolates lacked amplification of vatA, vatB, ermA and ermC genes. Molecular typing resulted genetic variation in protein A (6-12 repeats) and coagulase genes (A-E patterns) were observed. Coagulase A and D genotypes were more prevalent in antibiotic-resistant isolates, while E, B and C in susceptible ones. The significant observation was the prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus, which were resistant to multiple antibiotics. Findings revealed the status of resistant isolates in herd that might be helpful in treatment, controlling of resistant strains and culling of cows for mastitis reduction.
