Human enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) are the two major etiological agents in major outbreaks of hand, foot, and mouth disease. Transmission of these viruses is facilitated by prolonged environmental survival and their resistance to biocides, and effective disinfection is crucial to interrupt the cycle of environmental spread. We tested the virucidal efficacy of sodium hypochlorite against both EV71 and CVA16, performed according to the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) test criteria and methods approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency. Our results indicated the complete inactivation of infectivity of EV71 and CVA16 after a 5-minute exposure to 3120 ppm sodium hypochlorite.
