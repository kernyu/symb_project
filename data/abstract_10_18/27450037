Copper is a well proven antimicrobial material which can be used in the form of a coating on the touch surfaces. Those coating can offer a good service as touch surface for very long time if only they possess good mechanical properties like scratch resistance and microhardness. In the present work the above mentioned mechanical properties were determined on the electrodeposited copper thin film; deposited on double zincated aluminium. During deposition, current density was varied from 2Adm(-2) to 10Adm(-2), to produce crystallite size in the range of 33.5nm to 66nm. The crystallite size was calculated from the X-ray peak broadening (Scherrers formula) which were later confirmed by TEM micrographs. The scratch hardness and microhardness of the coating were measured and correlated with the crystallite size in the copper coating. Both characteristic values were found to increase with the reduction in crystallite size. Reduced crystallite size (Hall-Petch effect) and preferred growth of copper films along (111) plane play a significant role on the increase in the hardness of the coating. Further, TEM analysis reveals the presence of nano-twins in the film deposited at higher current density, which contributed to a large extent to the sharp increase of coating hardness compared to the mechanism of Hall-Petch effect. The antimicrobial ability of the coated sample has been evaluated against Escherichia coli bacteria and which is compared with that of commercially available bulk copper using the colony count method. 94% of E. coli cells were died after six hours of exposure to the copper coated surface. The morphology of the copper treated cells was studied using SEM.
