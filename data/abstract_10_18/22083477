For macrolides, clinical activity but also the development of bacterial resistance has been attributed to prolonged therapeutic and subtherapeutic concentrations. Although erythromycin is a long-established antimicrobial, concomitant determination of the pharmacokinetics of erythromycin and its metabolites in different compartments is limited. To better characterize the pharmacokinetics of erythromycin and its anhydrometabolite (anhydroerythromycin [AHE]) in different compartments during and after the end of treatment with 500 mg of erythromycin four times daily, concentration-time profiles were determined in plasma, interstitial space of muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue, and white blood cells (WBCs) at days 1 and 3 of treatment and 2 and 7 days after end of therapy. In WBCs, concentrations of erythromycin exceeded those in plasma approximately 40-fold, while free concentrations in plasma and tissue were comparable. The observed delay of peak concentrations in tissue might be caused by fast initial cellular uptake. Two days after the end of treatment, subinhibitory concentrations were observed in plasma and interstitial space of both soft tissues, while 7 days after the end of treatment, erythromycin was not detectable in any compartment. This relatively short period of subinhibitory concentrations may be advantageous compared to other macrolides. The ratio of erythromycin over AHE on day 1 was highest in plasma (2.81 +/- 3.45) and lowest in WBCs (0.27 +/- 0.22). While the ratio remained constant between single dose and steady state, after the end of treatment the concentration of AHE declined more slowly than that of the parent compound, indicating the importance of the metabolite for the prolonged drug interaction of erythromycin.
