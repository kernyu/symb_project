OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antibiotic resistance genes inserted into class 1 and class 2 integrons in Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) isolates obtained from nine different cities in Turkey. METHODS: A collection of 281 A. baumannii clinical isolates were collected from nine diferent state hospitals in Turkey and were confirmed as A. baumannii by conventional biochemical, API testing and bla-OXA-51 specific PCR. The isolates were examined by PCR for existence of class 1 and 2 integron gene cassettes. RESULTS: They were characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility testing and the highest resistance rates were determined for piperacillin (90.03%), ciprofloxacin (87.54%), cefepime and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (81.13%). The lowest resistance rates was for cefotaxime (3.55%). class I integrons were detected in 6.4% (18/281) of A. baumannii strains and no class 2 integron was detected. The gene cassettes of class 1 integrons AacC1-AAC(3)I-aadA1, AacC1-aadA1, AAC(3)-I, AAC(3)-I -AAC(3)-I -aadA1, TEM-1, AAC(3)-I-aadA1 - AAC(3)-I -AAC(3)-I, AAC(3)-I -AAC(3)-I -AAC(3)-I -aadA1, AAC(3)-I - aadA1, AAC(3)-I-AAC(3)-I, AAC(3)-I-aadA1- AAC(3)-I-aadA1, AAC(3)-I- AAC(3)-I- aadA1-AAC(3)-I-aadA1 were detected in eighteen strains. The aac genes family were most frequently found integrated into the class 1 integrons and it was followed by aadA genes and TEM-1 genes. CONCLUSIONS: This is an extensive study on the distribution of class 1 integron among A. baumannii in Turkey. In addition to these, two new alleles were observed. Their percentage rates of similarity to other cassettes are 95% aadA1 ( TKA18) and 89% aadA1 (ANKA3).
