Neutropenia remains the predominant predisposing factor for infection in most cancer patients. Bacterial and fungal infections are common in this setting. Not all neutropenic patients have the same risk of developing severe infection or serious medical complications. Although all patients with neutropenia and fever should receive prompt, empiric antibiotic therapy, low-risk patients can be effectively managed without hospitalization-often with the administration of oral antibiotics. Other patients need hospital-based therapy. The emergence of resistant microorganisms has become a significant problem in neutropenic patients. Frequent epidemiologic surveys to detect the emergence of resistant organisms are recommended. Antibiotic stewardship and Infection Control Programs are important tools in combating resistant organisms.
