BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the day-care interventions implemented in southern Sweden to restrict the dispersion of penicillin-non-susceptible pneumococci with a minimum inhibitory concentration of penicillin G of at least 0.5 mg/l (PNSP0.5). METHODS: A retrospective epidemiological study was performed and data from 109 day-care centre interventions from 2000 to 2010 were analysed, including screening results from 7157 individuals. RESULTS: It was found that 42% of the children were carriers of pneumococci and 5% of the screened children were PNSP0.5 carriers. Very few personnel were PNSP0.5 carriers and they were carriers for only a short time. Significantly more contact cases with the same serogroup as the index case were found in the first screening and in the same department as the index case, but a substantial number of contact cases were found in adjacent departments. CONCLUSIONS: Screening of personnel is not worth the effort. Based on our results, procedures to restrict dispersion of PNSP0.5 in day-care centres could be improved. To find the majority of contact cases with PNSP0.5 an early screening including adjacent departments seems to be the best approach.
