Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) plays a central role in glycolysis. Because cancer cells rely on aerobic glycolysis rather than oxidative phosphorylation, GAPDH-depleting agents have a therapeutic potential to impede cancer cell proliferation. Knockdown of GAPDH by RNA interference induced the accelerated senescent phenotype in A549 cells, suggesting that GAPDH is a potential molecular target for combination chemotherapy. The cytotoxic effects of a panel of anticancer drugs, 5-fluorouracil, 5-fluorouridine, 5-fluorodeoxyuridine, 6-thioguanine, cytarabine, fludarabine, cladribine, clofarabine, 2-chloroadenosine, and doxorubicin, were assessed in GAPDH-depleted A549 cells using a cell proliferation assay. GAPDH-depleted A549 cells, when compared with control cells, exhibited increased chemoresistance to several antimetabolite agents including cytarabine [inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) 1.7+/-0.3 vs. 0.03+/-0.02 mumol/l], 2-chloroadenosine (IC50 7.1+/-1.8 vs. 1.5+/-0.6 mumol/l), 6-thioguanine (IC50 7.5+/-1.6 vs. 1.4+/-0.5 mumol/l), 5-fluorouracil (IC50 13.2+/-2.5 vs. 3.0+/-0.7 mumol/l), and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (IC50 >100 vs. 3.7+/-0.9 mumol/l), which we designated as group A agents. In contrast, GAPDH-deficient and GAPDH-proficient cells were equally sensitive to group B agents including doxorubicin (IC50 0.05+/-0.02 vs. 0.04+/-0.02 mumol/l), fludarabine (IC50 18.5+/-2.3 vs. 15.7+/-2.8 mumol/l), 5-fluorouridine (IC50 0.1+/-0.03 vs. 0.1+/-0.03 mumol/l), clofarabine (IC50 0.7+/-0.3 vs. 0.5+/-0.3 mumol/l), and cladribine (IC50 0.5+/-0.1 vs. 0.5+/-0.2 mumol/l). After treatment with group B agents at concentrations equivalent to 7-10-fold the IC50 value, the fraction of apoptotic cells in GAPDH-depleted, senescent A549 cells was similar to that in GAPDH-proficient cells. Our study identified the antimetabolite drugs active in senescent cells that can be used in combination with GAPDH inhibitors in cancer treatment. GAPDH-targeted combination therapy is a novel strategy to control the proliferation of tumor cells.
