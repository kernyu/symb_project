Background: We examined the risk of sepsis within 90 days after discharge from a previous hospital stay by type of antibiotic received during the previous stay. Methods: We retrospectively identified a cohort of hospitalized patients from the Truven Health MarketScan Hospital Drug Database. We examined the association between the use of certain antibiotics, determined a priori, during the initial hospital stay and risk of post-discharge sepsis controlling for potential confounding factors in a multivariable logistic regression model. Our primary exposure was receipt of antibiotics more strongly associated with clinically important microbiome disruption. Our primary outcome was a hospital stay within 90 days of the index stay that included an ICD-9-CM discharge diagnosis of severe sepsis (995.92) or septic shock (785.52). Results: Among 516 hospitals, we randomly selected a single stay for eligible patients. Of those, 0.17% developed severe sepsis/septic shock within 90 days after discharge. The risk of sepsis associated with exposure to our high risk antibiotics was 65% higher compared to those without antibiotic exposure. Conclusions: Our study identified an increased risk of sepsis within 90 days of discharge among patients with exposure to high risk or increased quantities of antibiotics during hospitalization. Given a significant proportion of inpatient antimicrobial use may be unnecessary, this study builds on previous evidence suggesting that increased stewardship efforts in hospitals may not only prevent antimicrobial resistance, CDI and other adverse effects, but also reduce unwanted outcomes potentially related to disruption of the microbiota, including sepsis.
