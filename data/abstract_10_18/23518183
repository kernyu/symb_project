Four closely related KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, which were isolated from the patients with neonatal sepsis, harbored bla(CTX-M-14), bla(TEM-1), bla(CTX-M-15), bla(SHV-11),bla(SHV-12), class 1 integron, qnrS1, acc(6')-Ib-cr, and rmtB genes. Multilocus sequence typing experiments showed that all isolates but Kp122 were proven to share the same sequence type (ST), ST11. These isolates have not yet been previously reported in a university-affiliated children's hospital or in the city of Wenzhou.
