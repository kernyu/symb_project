BACKGROUND: gammadelta T cells play an important role in infectious, autoimmune, or neoplastic diseases. Here, a study was conducted to investigate the dynamic changes in phenotype and function of peripheral gammadelta T cells in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) during pegylated-interferon (pegIFN)-alpha treatment, and to explore their roles in IFN-alpha therapy. METHODS: Total 15 CHB patients with pegIFN-alpha therapy and 6 healthy controls (HC) were enrolled in this study. Flow cytometry was used for the study of frequency of peripheral gammadelta T cells, subtypes, effector or memory gammadelta T cells, and also the IFN-gamma+, TNF-alpha+, CD107a+ or Granzyme B+ gammadelta T cells in 10 patients at week 0, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48 of treatment. Another 5 CHB patients and 6 HC were recruited for the gammadelta T cell isolation, and gene expression in gammadelta T cells was evaluated before or after IFN-alpha treatment in vitro. RESULTS: Although gammadeltaT cells decreased in CHB patients during pegIFN-alpha therapy, their capacities to produce TNF-alpha and to express CD107a were enhanced. More effector gammadeltaT cells (CD27-CD45RA+) were found in the response group than in non-response group. Furthermore, IFN-alpha boosted the expression of Mx2 and cytokine genes in gammadeltaT cells from CHB patients in vitro. CONCLUSION: IFN-alpha could enhance the cytokine production or cytotoxicity potential of gammadeltaT cells in vivo and in vitro. The enhanced function of gammadeltaT cells might contribute to the effect of IFN-alpha treatment.
