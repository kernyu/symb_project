For more than two decades, chloroquine (CQ) was largely and deliberately used as first choice drug for malaria treatment. However, worldwide increasing cases of resistant strains of Plasmodium have hampered its use.

In this review, we discuss recent findings and CQ mechanisms of action vis-a-vis its use as a broad adjunct therapy.
