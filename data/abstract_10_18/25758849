Surgical site infections are among the complications that can be reduced with the timely implementation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy. A 3-D approach to judicious antimicrobial use focuses on the de-escalation of systemic antimicrobial therapy, design of dosing regimens, and decontamination of the surgeon, patient, and environment. De-escalation can be accomplished in part through proper antimicrobial prophylaxis. Dosing regimens should be designed to maximize efficacy and minimize resistance. Decontamination includes disinfection of inanimate surfaces and timely application of appropriate antiseptics at concentrations that maximize efficacy.
