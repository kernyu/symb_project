The Genotype(R)MTBDRplus molecular test is a method that allows identification of the most frequent mutations associated with resistance to major first-line antituberculosis drugs, Isoniazid (INH) and Rifampicin (RFP). The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of the molecular test with culture and smear- positive sputum samples. We evaluated 95 cultures and 100 sputum samples with resistance profiles previously determined by the reference method "Agar Plate Proportions" (APP). The molecular test from cultures showed a sensitivity of 100 %, 97,5 % and 96,97 % for RIF, INH and MDR respectively while from sputums the sensitivity was 95,65 %, 96,77 % and 95,24 % for RIF, INH and MDR respectively. We conclude that the molecular test Genotype(R)MTBDRplus is a very useful tool to detect resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin simultaneously (MDR-TB) in up to 72 hours from sputum samples or cultures.
