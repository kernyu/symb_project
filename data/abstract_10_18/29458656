Bacteria have evolved several strategies to survive a myriad of harmful conditions in the environment and in hosts. In Gram-negative bacteria, responses to nutrient limitation, oxidative or nitrosative stress, envelope stress, exposure to antimicrobials and other growth-limiting stresses have been linked to the development of antimicrobial resistance. This results from the activation of protective changes to cell physiology (decreased outer membrane permeability), resistance transporters (drug efflux pumps), resistant lifestyles (biofilms, persistence) and/or resistance mutations (target mutations, production of antibiotic modification/degradation enzymes). In targeting and interfering with essential physiological mechanisms, antimicrobials themselves are considered as stresses to which protective responses have also evolved. In this review, we focus on envelope stress responses that affect the expression of outer membrane porins and their impact on antimicrobial resistance. We also discuss evidences that indicate the role of antimicrobials as signaling molecules in activating envelope stress responses.
