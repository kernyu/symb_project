Antibiotic activity was compared for Cryptococcus humicola cellobiose lipids, the mixture of 2,3,4-capital O, Cyrillic-triacetyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->4)-(6-capital O, Cyrillic-acetyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->16)-2,16-dihydroxyhexodecanoic acid and 2,3,4-capital O, Cyrillic-triacetyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->4)-(6-capital O, Cyrillic-acetyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->16)-2,17,18-trihydroxyoctotodecanoic acid, and the commercial sophorose lipid mixture of a mono-acetylated acidic sophorose lipid and a di-acetylated acidic sophorose lipid, both containing the C18:1 fatty acid residue. The MIC values of cellobiose lipids were 0.005 and 0.04 mg/mL for Filobasidiella neoformans and Candida tropicalis, respectively. The MIC values of sophorose lipids were 1 and 15 mg/mL for F. neoformans and C. tropicalis, respectively. MIC values for some bacteria were in the range of 10-30 mg/mL for both glycolipid preparations. Both sophorose lipids and cellobiose lipids displayed a membrane-damaging activity against F. neoformans. The treatment with these glycolipids reduces the content of ATP in the cells of test cultures and results in their staining with ethidium bromide.
