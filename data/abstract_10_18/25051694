AIM: Study sensitivity of nosocomial microbes--causative agents of post-operative infectious complications in surgical profile patients to bacteriophages. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Microbe isolates from biosubstrates of 223 surgical patients served as material. Microbes were isolated from blood, urine, wounds, intravascular catheters, abdominal cavity drainage, discharge of pharynx, trachea (343 strains). Phagolysability of strains was determined by Ott method. RESULTS: A good lysability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella, Escherichia coli by specific complex and monophages and lower--of staphylococci and enterococci was found in the presence of 83% methicillin-resistant staphylococci strains and 94% Gram-negative bacteria strains producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases. CONCLUSION: Continuation of use of various bacteriophage preparations against Gram-negative bacteria and implementation of measures to adopt phage preparations to staphylococci and enterococci are perspective considering multiple resistance of microbes to antibiotics.
