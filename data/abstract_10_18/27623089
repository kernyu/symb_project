Nitroreductases (NRs) are flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-dependent enzymes that catalyze the biotransformation of organic nitro compounds (RNO2; R = alkyl, aryl) to the nitroso RN=O, hydroxylamino RNHOH, or amine RNH2 derivatives. Metronidazole (Mtz) is a nitro-containing antibiotic that is commonly prescribed for lower-gut infections caused by the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium difficile. C. difficile infections rank number one among hospital acquired infections, and can result in diarrhea, severe colitis, or even death. Although NRs have been implicated in Mtz resistance of C. difficile, no NRs have been characterized from the hypervirulent R20291 strain of C. difficile. We report the first expression, purification, and three-dimensional X-ray crystal structures of two NRs from the C. difficile R20291 strain. The X-ray crystal structures of the two NRs were solved to 2.1 A resolution. Their homodimeric structures exhibit the classic NR alpha+beta fold, with each protomer binding one FMN cofactor near the dimer interface. Functional assays demonstrate that these two NRs metabolize Mtz with associated re-oxidation of the proteins. Importantly, these results represent the first isolation and characterization of NRs from the hypervirulent R20291 strain of relevance to organic RNO2 (e.g., Mtz) metabolism.
