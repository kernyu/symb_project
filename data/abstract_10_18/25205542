Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is highly prevalent, and its typing plays a crucial role in epidemiology and evolution in both health and community settings. Multiplex PCR and staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing based on mec complexes and cassette chromosome recombinase (ccr) allotypes have been developed for MRSA identification. The first of these procedures can identify 4 mec classes (A, B, C1, and E) and 2 ccr allotypes (B2 and B4) in one tube, and the second can identify mecA, mec class C2, and 3 allotypes (A1, A3, and C). Our method offers a novel means to further differentiate between the main SCCmec types I through XI and is both highly sensitive (detectable up to 0.3etag DNA) and specific (100%). Several SCCmec types (I, III, IV, V and a non-typeable group) were found in 66 MRSA isolates obtained from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam and Nakhon Pathom, Thailand. SCCmec type III was highly predominant in both regions. The designed assay is rapid, convenient, flexible, and reliable. Therefore, this assay is suitable for the high-throughput screening of the main SCCmec types of MRSA isolates.
