CONTEXT: The antibiotic susceptibility is the cornerstone for the eradication therapies of Helicobacter pylori. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence of primary resistance of H. pylori was evaluated in an urban Brazilian population. METHODS: H. pylori isolates were obtained from patients submitted to an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for the evaluation of dyspeptic symptoms. Biopsies from antrum, corpus and fundus were taken to determine the antibiotic susceptibility of H. pylori isolates. The minimal inhibitory concentration of furazolidone and bismuth were routinely determined by agar dilution method and the minimal inhibitory for amoxicillin, clarithromycin, tetracycline, levofloxacin, and metronidazole were routinely determined with the E-test. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients were included. In vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of H. pylori strains were obtained from 39 patients. Resistance to metronidazole was detected in 20 patients (51%), to clarithromycin in 3 patients (8%), to levofloxacin in 9 patients (23%) and to bismuth in 2 patients (5%). There was no observed resistance to amoxicillin, tetracycline or furazolidone. CONCLUSION: Due to the low amoxicillin and clarithromycin resistance observed in this study, therapies using these antimicrobials remain appropriated first-line H. pylori therapy.
