Physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying quantitative resistance of plants to pathogens are still poorly understood, but could depend upon differences in the intensity or timing of general defense responses. This may be the case for the biosynthesis of phenolics which are known to increase after elicitation by pathogens. We thus tested the hypothesis that differences in quantitative resistance were related to differential induction of phenolics by pathogen-derived elicitors. Five potato cultivars (Solanum tuberosum, L.) spanning a range of quantitative resistance were treated with a concentrated culture filtrate (CCF) of Phytophthora infestans or purified lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Pectobacterium atrosepticum. The kinetic of phenolics accumulation was followed and a set of typical phenolics was identified: chlorogenic acid, phenolamides and flavonols including rutin (quercetin-3-O-rutinoside) and nicotiflorin (kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside). Our results showed that CCF but not LPS induced differential accumulation of major phenolics among cultivars. Total phenolics were related with resistance to P. atrosepticum but not to P. infestans. However, nicotiflorin was inversely related with resistance to both pathogens. Rutin, but not nicotiflorin, inhibited pathogen growth in vitro at physiological concentrations. These data therefore suggest that (i) several phenolics are candidate markers for quantitative resistance in potato, (ii) some of these are pathogen specific although they are produced by a general defense pathway, (iii) resistance marker molecules do not necessarily have antimicrobial activity, and (iv) the final content of these target molecules-either constitutive or induced-is a better predictor of resistance than their inducibility by pathogen elicitors.
