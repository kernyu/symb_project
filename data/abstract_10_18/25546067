Bacterial infections represent the second cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality in dogs, so the present study aimed to investigate the bacterial involvement in canine neonatal mortality and to evaluate the antibiotic susceptibility of the isolated bacteria. Fifty-one newborn purebred puppies, born dead or dead within 28 days of age, belonging to 36 different litters, were enrolled and the following procedures were performed on their fresh dead bodies: necropsy, collection of swabs by liver, kidney, lung, small bowel, and possible thoracic and/ or abdominal effusion, for both bacteriological examination and antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and collection of samples by the same organs for histology. About 47% of total swabs were positive at bacteriology (pure bacterial culture or bacterial association). In 65% of the newborn puppies the mortality could be attributed to a bacterial infection. Although the high multidrug resistance, the most effective antimicrobials were third generation cephalosporins and fluorquinolones. In case of neonatal mortality, bacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing become essential for a targeted therapy in surviving littermates and for the management of following pregnancies in bitches with recurrent neonatal loss.
