Objectives: T-2307, a novel arylamidine, exhibits potent broad-spectrum activities against the majority of fungal pathogens. In this study, the antifungal activity of T-2307 against Cryptococcus gattii was evaluated in comparison with those of amphotericin B, fluconazole and voriconazole in vitro and in vivo . Methods: The MICs for 15 clinical isolates were determined according to CLSI guidelines and time-kill studies were performed using C. gattii YF2784. In a murine model for intranasal pulmonary infection caused by C. gattii YF2784, the test compounds were administered once daily for 7 days from 2 h or 14 days post-infection. The viable counts in the lungs and brain were determined at 21 days post-infection. Results: The MIC range, MIC 50 , MIC 90 and geometric mean MIC of T-2307 were 0.0078-0.0625, 0.0313, 0.0625 and 0.0394 mg/L, respectively. The MIC of T-2307 was significantly lower than those of fluconazole, voriconazole and amphotericin B. T-2307 showed concentration-dependent fungicidal activity at 4 times the MIC or higher. Administration of T-2307 at 2 mg/kg/day, amphotericin B at 1 mg/kg/day and fluconazole at 160 mg/kg/day from 2 h post-infection significantly reduced viable counts in the lungs and brain. However, when the administration was started 14 days post-infection, only T-2307 significantly reduced the viable counts in both the lungs and the brain at 1 mg/kg/day. Conclusions: T-2307 shows excellent in vitro and in vivo antifungal activities against C. gattii and would be a promising new candidate for the treatment of cryptococcosis.
