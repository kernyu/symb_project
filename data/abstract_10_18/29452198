BACKGROUND: Carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) have become an important cause of nosocomial infections of hospitalized patients. METHODS: To investigate the microbial infection patterns and molecular epidemiology characteristics of the carbapenem-resistant GNB isolates from a long-term hospitalized patient, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, phenotypic screening test for carbapenemase production, PCR screening and DNA sequencing of carbapenemase genes, repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-based PCR (REP-PCR), multilocus sequencing typing (MLST) and genetic environment analysis were performed. RESULTS: Twelve strains with carbapenemase genes were detected from 63 carbapenem-resistant isolates, including two blaIMP-25-carrying Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one blaNDM-1-carrying Citrobacter freundii, three blaNDM-1-carrying Klebsiella pneumoniae and six blaKPC-2-carrying K. pneumoniae. Only the blaNDM-1 genes were successfully transferred from three K. pneumoniae strains to Escherichia coli C600 by conjugation. Genetic environment of blaIMP-25, blaNDM-1 and blaKPC-2 genes in our study were consistent with previous reports. Molecular typing of K. pneumoniae performed by MLST revealed that most of the isolates belonged to ST11. blaNDM-1-carrying K. pneumoniae sequencing type 1416 was first reported in our study. CONCLUSIONS: Carbapenem-resistant GNB are common pathogens during long-term hospitalization, and ST11 blaKPC-2-carrying K. pneumoniae is the dominant bacterium in our study. Colonization and horizontal transmission of resistance by plasmids of carbapenem-resistant GNB have increased the risks of persistent infection and mortality of long-term hospitalized patients.
