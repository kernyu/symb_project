Saxitoxins (STX), neurotoxic alkaloids, fall under the umbrella of paralytic shellfish toxins produced by marine dinoflagellates and freshwater cyanobacteria. The genes responsible for the production of STX have been proposed, but factors that influence their expression and induce toxin efflux remain unclear. Here we characterize the putative STX NorM-like MATE transporters SxtF and SxtM. Complementation of the antibiotic-sensitive strain Escherichia coli KAM32 with these transporters decreased fluoroquinolone sensitivity, indicating that while becoming evolutionary specialized for STX transport these transporters retain relaxed specificity typical of this class. The transcriptional response of STX biosynthesis (sxtA) along with that of the STX transporters (sxtM and sxtF from Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii T3, and sxtM from Anabaena circinalis AWQC131C) were assessed in response to ionic stress. These data, coupled with a measure of toxin intracellular to extracellular ratios, provide an insight into the physiology of STX export. Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and Anabaena circinalis exhibited opposing responses under conditions of ionic stress. High Na(+) (10 mM) induced moderate alterations of transcription and STX localization, whereas high pH (pH 9) stimulated the greatest physiological response. Saxitoxin production and cellular localization are responsive to ionic strength, indicating a role of this molecule in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis.
