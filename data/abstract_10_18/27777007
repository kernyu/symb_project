A series of 12-oxime and O-oxime ether derivatives of dehydroabietic acid were synthesized and investigated for the antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus Newman strain and five multidrug-resistant strains (NRS-1, NRS-70, NRS-100, NRS-108, and NRS-271). The aromatic oximate derivative 11a showed the highest activity with MIC of 0.39-0.78mug/mL against S. aureus Newman. Of note, compounds 10b, 11 and 14 showed the most potent antibacterial activity against five multidrug-resistant S. aureus with MIC values of 1.25-3.13mug/mL. These results offered useful information for further strategic optimization in search of the antibacterial candidates against infection of multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria.
