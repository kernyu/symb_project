The genus Asaia has gained much interest lately owing to constant new species discoveries and its role as a potential opportunistic pathogen to humans. Here we describe a transient bacteremia due to Asaia lannensis in a patient with a psychiatric disorder (compulsive self-injection of different substances). Common phenotypic methods of identification failed to identify this organism, and only restriction fragment lenght polymorphism of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene allowed for proper identification. The isolate was highly resistant to most antibiotics. The paper also discusses the currently available medical literature, acknowledges the potential problems linked to the isolation of these strains and proposes an approach to species identification that can be applied in a clinical microbiology laboratory.
