The increasing resistance to nitroimidazole therapy and recurrence makes it crucial to develop new drugs against trichomoniasis. Over the past few years, a large number of research articles highlighting the synthetic and natural product research to combat Trichomonas vaginalis have been published. Electronic databases were searched to collect all data from the year 2006 through June 2017 for anti-Trichomonas activity potential of synthetic and natural products. This review article put together the synthetic and natural product research to find out an effective metronidazole alternative to cure trichomoniasis.
