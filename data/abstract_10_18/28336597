Providencia stuartii is frequently associated with nosocomial outbreaks and displays intrinsic resistance to many commonly used antimicrobials. We report here the draft genome sequence of a P. stuartii strain carrying acquired resistance genes conferring panresistance to cephalosporins (blaSHV-5 and blaVEB-1), carbapenems (blaVIM-1), and aminoglycosides (rmtB) involved in an outbreak in Greek hospitals.
