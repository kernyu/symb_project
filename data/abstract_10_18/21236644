DNA gyrase (GyrA and GyrB) and topoisomerase IV (ParC and ParE) are the two essential type II topoisomerases in Escherichia coli. These enzymes act via inhibition of DNA replication. Mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) of the gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE genes from clinical isolates of E. coli were determined by DNA sequencing of 54 ciprofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates from a hospital in Delhi, India. The majority of the E. coli isolates were shown to carry mutations in gyrA, parC and parE. Ciprofloxacin resistance due to accumulation of such a high number of mutations in the QRDR regions of gyrA at positions Ser83 and Asp87 and parC at position Ser80 as well as outside of the QRDR region of parE at Ser458 and Glu460 confers high-level resistance of ciprofloxacin in clinical isolates. The high frequency of occurrence of mutations in the parE gene (44.4% strains) is alarming, as topoisomerase IV is a secondary target of quinolones.
