The aim of this work was to analyze several clones of Helicobacter pylori isolated from a patient with gastric cancer, to evaluate i) genetic variability ii) virulence factors profile and iii) antimicrobial susceptibility against the drugs commonly used in the H. pylori therapy. A total of 32 H. pylori clones isolated from a biopsy sample coming from a patient with gastric cancer previously treated for H. pylori infection, were analyzed for: the genetic variability by amplified fragment polymorphism analysis; the vacA, cagA virulence status by PCR; the antimicrobial susceptibility by minimum inhibitory concentrations with the agar dilution method towards amoxicillin, clarithromycin, levofloxacin and tinidazole. The patient showed a mixed infection with the presence of at least 3 different strains. The clones isolated possessed the vacA, cagA virulence factors with a different allelic combination (vacA s1/i1/m1; s1/i1i2/m1; s2/i2/m2; s2/i1i2/m2) together with repeated cagA EPIYA motif pattern P1P2P3P3P3. Moreover, a pattern of multi-drug resistance was disclosed in the different clones. The presence of multiple H. pylori strains colonizing the same patient, with the main virulence factors displaying a different allelic combination and a different multi-drug resistance among isolates, point out the role of genetic variability generating, in time, more virulent and adapted strains.
