Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by blood flukes of the genus Schistosoma. This disease control has been widely made by praziquantel-reference drug, but resistance to this drug has already been found. There has been the finding of an imidazole alkaloid in jaborandi leaves-epiisopiloturine, which has known activity against adult, young and egg forms of Schistosoma mansoni. This alkaloid is an apolar molecule with difficult solubility; therefore, the liposomal structure of epiisopiloturine was proposed. Liposomes are carrying structures of drugs that may enhance solubility of compounds such as epiisopiloturine. In this work, we report in vitro epiisopiloturine-loaded liposomes effect formed by different concentrations of lipids 9:1 (weight ratio) dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine:cholesterol and 8:2 (weight ratio) dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine:cholesterol. Results have showed that epiisopiloturine extraction and isolation have been successful through high-performance liquid chromatography-HPLC and its purity confirmed through mass spectrometry has showed 287 Da molecular mass. Formulations from 9:1 DPPC:cholesterol and 8:2 DPPC:cholesterol with loaded EPI (300 microg/ml) have killed parasites at 100% after incubation 96 h and 120 h, respectively. Confocal microscopy employed to observe morphological alterations in the tegument of adult form of Schistosoma mansoni. Details from interaction, between epiisopiloturine and liposome, have been achieved by semi-empirical AM1 calculations, which have showed that epiisopiloturine inside is more stable than the outside form, at least 10 kcal. This is first time that schistosomicidal activity has been reported for epiisopiloturine-loaded into liposome.
