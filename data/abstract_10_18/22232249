Hygromycin B is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that inhibits protein synthesis in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Twenty-four hygromycin B-resistants mutants were isolated from sake yeast, and were divided into three different degrees of strength according to hygromycin B resistance. Three of four hygromycin B strongly resistant mutants produced increased amounts of isoamyl acetate in sake brewing test, although isoamyl alcohol levels remained unchanged. Many hygromycin B-resistants mutants showed higher E/A ratios than K-701 in culture with koji extract medium. Strain HMR-18 produced the largest amount of isoamyl acetate, and its alcohol acetyltransferase (AATFase) activity was 1.3-fold that of K-701. DNA microarray analysis showed that many genes overexpressed in HMR-18 were involved in stress responses (heat shock, low pH, and so on) but HMR-18 showed thermo- and acid-sensitivity. It was strongly resistant to hygromycin B and another aminoglycoside antibiotic, G418.
