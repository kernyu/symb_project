The aim of this study was to identify genes conferring resistance to fluoroquinolones and extended-spectrum beta-lactams in non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) from food-producing animals in China. In total, 31 non-duplicate NTS were obtained from food-producing animals that were sick. Isolates were identified and serotyped and the genetic relatedness of the isolates was determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of XbaI-digested chromosomal DNA. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute methodology. The presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and fluoroquinolone resistance genes was established by PCR and sequencing. Genes encoded on transmissible elements were identified by conjugation and transformation. Plasmids were typed by PCR-based replicon typing. The occurrence and diversity of numerous different transmissible genes conferring fluoroquinolone resistance [qnrA, qnrD, oqxA and aac(6')-Ib-cr] and ESBLs (CTX-M-27 and CTX-M-14), and which co-resided in different isolates and serovars of Salmonella, were much higher than in European countries. Furthermore, different plasmids encoded fluoroquinolone resistance (ca. 6 kb) and beta-lactam resistance (ca. 63 kb) and these co-resided in isolates with mutations in topoisomerase genes (gyrA and parC) giving very resistant Salmonella. The presence of multidrug-resistant bacteria in food-producing animals in countries that export foodstuffs suggests that global transfer of antibiotic resistances from country to country on food is possible.
