INTRODUCTION: For the last 20 years the world has seen the emergence of a growing epidemic of MDR-TB, followed by the appearance of XDR-TB. Both require longer, more expensive and more toxic treatments. MDR-TB and especially XDR-TB are associated with a lower cure rate than non MDR-TB. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed retrospectively all cases of MDR-and XDR-TB managed at St Pierre University Hospital between 1996 and 2010. Epidemiological, clinical, bacteriological, treatment, follow up and outcome were collected and analysed. RESULTS: We recorded 73 instances of MDR-TB and 11 XDR-TB for a total of 78 patients. All but 4 patients were of non Belgian origin. 10 patients were co-infected with HIV. A median of 4 active drugs (1-5) were used for a median of 448 days (329-616). 41 MDR-TB (56%) and 1 XDR-TB (1%) were considered as cured and 20 are still on treatment. Since 2007, increasing resistance to second line injectable drugs, fluoroquinolones and even linezolid (1 case) is observed. Extensive resistance was mainly found in patients who had previously been mismanaged with second line agents. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the growing epidemic of MDR and XDR-TB, it emphasizes the importance of proper diagnosis and adequate management of TB in patients at risk for resistance and stresses the need for new therapies.
