In 2008, the Netherlands Association of Gastroenterologists and Hepatologists (Nederlands Vereniging van Maag-Darm-Leverartsen) published the Dutch national guidelines for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection. New insights into the treatment of chronic hepatitis B with relevance for clinical practice have been adopted in these concise, revised guidelines. The most important changes include the choice of initial antiviral therapy, licensing of tenofovir for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B and the management of antiviral resistance.
