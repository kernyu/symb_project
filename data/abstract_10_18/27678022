OBJECTIVE To evaluate risk factors for and molecular characteristics of community-onset extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant (ESC-R) Enterobacteriaceae (EB) urinary tract infections (UTIs) in a US health system. DESIGN Case-control study. PARTICIPANTS All patients presenting to the emergency department or outpatient practices with EB UTIs from December 21, 2010, through April 22, 2013, were included. Case patients had ESC-R EB UTIs. Control patients had ESC-susceptible EB UTIs and were matched 1:1 on study year. METHODS Risk factors for ESC-R EB UTI were assessed using multivariable conditional logistic regression. A subset of case isolates was evaluated for extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. RESULTS A total of 302 patients with community-onset EB UTI were included, of which 151 were cases. On multivariable analysis, risk factors for ESC-R EB UTI included trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole use in the prior 6 months (odds ratio, 2.40 [95% CI, 1.22-4.70]; P=.01), older age (1.03 [1.01-1.04]; P<.001), diabetes (2.91 [1.32-6.41]; P=.008), and presentation to the emergency department ( 2.42 [1.31-4.46]; P=.005). The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among 120 case isolates was 52% CTX-M, 29% TEM, 20% OXA, and 13% SHV. The prevalence of AmpC was 25%. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of the CTX-M Escherichia coli isolates showed no distinct clusters. CONCLUSIONS Use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, older age, diabetes, and presentation to the emergency department were associated with community-onset ESC-R EB UTI. There was a high prevalence of CTX-M among our community isolates. Further studies are needed to determine strategies to limit emergence of these organisms in the community.
