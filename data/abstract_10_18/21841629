Each year around one million urinary catheters are inserted in NHS hospitals. In around 60% of cases prophylactic antibiotics are prescribed prior to removal. This practice aims to reduce infection risks, but is not supported by evidence. Inappropriate prescribing increases antibiotic resistance, already a serious and worsening problem, and exposes patients to the hazards of antibiotic prescribing. This practice also costs an estimated pound1.35- pound2.7 million pounds annually. Nurses at all levels can have a huge influence on catherterization rates and catheter management. This can reduce the risks of harm and infection and improve quality of care.
