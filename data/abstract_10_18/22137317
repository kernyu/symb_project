Activation of the mTOR pathway subsequent to phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) mutation may be associated with glucocorticoid (GC) resistance in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The combination activity of rapamycin and dexamethasone in cell lines and xenograft models of ALL was determined. Compared with either drug alone, dexamethasone+rapamycin showed significantly greater apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in some cell lines, and was more frequently seen in T-lineage cell lines with PTEN mutation. The combination significantly extended the event-free survival of mice carrying PTEN mutated xenografts. Our data suggest that PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitors could benefit patients with PTEN mutated T-ALL.
