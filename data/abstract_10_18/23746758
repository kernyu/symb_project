Quorum sensing (QS) is a process of cell-cell communication mechanism occurs between the bacterial cells through the secretary signal molecules. This QS mechanism has been shown to control over the expression of various genes responsible for the production of virulence factors in several bacterial pathogens. Hence, the present study was intended to evaluate the antipathogenic potential of mangrove trees of the genus Rhizophora against the QS dependent virulence factors production in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, clinical isolates CI-I (GU447237) and CI-II (GU447238). The methanol extract of Rhizophora apiculata and R. mucronata (1 mg/ml) showed significant inhibition against QS dependent virulence factors production such as LasA protease, LasB elastase, total protease, pyocyanin pigment production and biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa PAO1, CI-I and CI-II. This study for the first time, reports the quorum sensing inhibitory (QSI) potential of Rhizophora spp. against P. aeruginosa infections.
