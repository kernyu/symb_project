This study reports on the emergence of cfr-harbouring coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) among patients who received linezolid therapy in two hospitals in Hangzhou, China. The mechanisms of resistance and transmission were analysed for these resistant isolates. Eight Staphylococcus capitis isolates, one Staphylococcus epidermidis isolate and one Staphylococcus hominis isolate, obtained from patients who had received linezolid therapy in two hospitals in Hangzhou, China, were confirmed as linezolid resistant, with MICs ranging from 8 to >256 mg l(-1). The linezolid usage data of the ten patients before isolation of the linezolid-resistant CoNS were collected. PFGE analysis showed that the eight S. capitis isolates from the two hospitals belonged to the same clone. Nine of the linezolid-resistant CoNS isolates carried the cfr gene, which was located on plasmids of a similar size. A 5.3 kb fragment containing the cfr gene, revealing 99 % identity to the sequence of the cfr-harbouring plasmid pSS-01 reported previously, was determined by PCR mapping for all cfr-positive isolates, and the cfr gene was flanked by two copies of IS256-like elements. Thus, these results document the emergence of linezolid-resistant CoNS isolates carrying the cfr gene in Hangzhou, China. Effective nosocomial infection control strategies and the judicious use of antibiotics will be required to prevent further spread of this resistance mechanism.
