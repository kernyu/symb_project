BACKGROUND: One of the main causes of adverse complications following kidney transplantation is urinary tract infection (UTI). This study was done to define the incidence rate, clinical profiles, causative microorganisms, and UTI risk factors among kidney transplant recipients in Mashhad city. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, we perused medical files of 247 kidney recipients who underwent transplant surgery at Mashhad University Montaserie Hospital, during 2012-2014. All patients were followed for UTI during the 1(st) year after surgery. RESULTS: 75 episodes of UTI developed by 152 pathogens in 56 (22.7%) of patients during 1-year follow-up. 26.6% of total UTIs were diagnosed within the 1(st) month after transplantation. The most frequently isolated uropathogens were Escherichia coli (55.3%, n = 84). The high rate of candiduria (8.5%) was observed, too. CONCLUSION: UTI is known as one of the hospitalization reasons in kidney transplantation recipients. Defining appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis against bacterial and fungal agents and early removal of urethral catheter are suggested to decrease posttransplantation complications.
