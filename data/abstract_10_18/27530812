BACKGROUND: The largest outbreak of isoniazid-resistant (INH-R) Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Western Europe is centred in North London, with over 400 cases diagnosed since 1995. In the current study, we evaluated the genetic variation in a subset of clinical samples from the outbreak with the hypothesis that these isolates have unique biological characteristics that have served to prolong the outbreak. METHODS: Fitness assays, mutation rate estimation, and whole-genome sequencing were performed to test for selective advantage and compensatory mutations. RESULTS: This detailed analysis of the genetic variation of these INH-R samples suggests that this outbreak consists of successful, closely related, circulating strains with heterogeneous resistance profiles and little or no associated fitness cost or impact on their mutation rate. CONCLUSIONS: Specific deletions and SNPs could be a peculiar feature of these INH-R M. tuberculosis isolates, and could potentially explain their persistence over the years.
