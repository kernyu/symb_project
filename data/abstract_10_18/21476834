Precursor transformation, clonal sustenance, and therapeutic resistance in cancer are significantly mediated by deregulated reactive oxygen species (ROS), which primarily act as DNA-stressors. Here, we demonstrate that elevated ROS in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) may represent a promising therapeutic target. We designed organochalcogens, which, based on a 'sensor/effector' principle, would confer selective cytotoxicity through the generation of intolerably high ROS levels preferentially in CLL cells, as these carry a high-level redox burden. Our novel compounds show an encouraging profile of efficient induction of apoptosis, low normal cell toxicity, and promising chemotherapy synergism. These findings warrant further mechanistic and preclinical studies of this therapeutic principle in CLL.
