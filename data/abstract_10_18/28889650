There are various factors that contribute to development of antimicrobial resistance. Overuse, inappropriate prescribing and extensive agricultural use of antibiotics are some of the factors which have been identified. Antibiotics are almost always universally packaged by manufacturers in packs that are heavily driven by cost of economies and convenience rather than by any scientific basis or duration of therapy. So, in this study, the correlation of the treatment guidelines with the choice of antibiotics and whether packing size contributes to leftover dosing units when used according to guideline recommendations were assessed.
