BACKGROUND: Recurrent hepatitis C infection after liver transplantation (LT) is associated with lower rates of graft and patient survival. METHODS: Here we describe the first use of daclatasvir, simeprevir, and ribavirin (RBV) as an all-oral triple regimen administered to 6 liver transplant recipients with recurrent hepatitis C, one with GT 1a and 5 with GT 1b. All patients were treated for 24 weeks. Trough levels of immunosuppression, laboratory measures, and potential adverse effects were closely monitored. RESULTS: For all patients, viral load became undetectable between treatment weeks 4 and 12. One patient experienced a viral breakthrough at the 10th week of treatment; this was associated with the selection of resistance-associated variants (D168Y in NS3 and DeltaP32 in NS5A). For the other 5 patients, end-of-treatment response and for 4 patients SVR24 was achieved. Viremia recurred in one patient 4 weeks after the end of treatment, which was again associated with the selection of resistance-associated variants (D168V in NS3 and DeltaP32 in NS5A). Clinical measures of liver function improved substantially for all patients. Adverse events were few and limited to moderate anemia caused by RBV. Importantly, adjustments to the immunosuppressant dosage were not required. CONCLUSIONS: The described regimen appears to be safe and effective for liver transplant patients and will be a promising treatment regimen for post-LT patients.
