Therapy for infection with HIV-2 remains limited. We report an HIV-2-infected patient in whom genotyping demonstrated PI, NRTI and NNRTI resistance, with a subsequent response to raltegravir- and maraviroc-based therapy. Further studies are required to assess the clinical efficacy of maraviroc in HIV-2 infection.
