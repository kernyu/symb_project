Resistance to receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) blockade in breast cancer is often mediated by activation of bypass pathways that sustain growth. Src and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) are two intrinsic targets that are downstream of most RTKs. To date, limited clinical efficacy has been observed with either Src or mTOR inhibitors when used as single agents. Resistance to mTOR inhibitors is associated with loss of negative feedback regulation, resulting in phosphorylation and activation of AKT. Herein, we describe a novel role for Src in contributing to rapalog-induced AKT activation. We found that dual activation of Src and the mTOR pathway occurs in nearly half of all breast cancers, suggesting potential cross-talk. As expected, rapamycin inhibition of mTOR results in feedback activation of AKT in breast cancer cell lines. Addition of the Src/c-Abl inhibitor, dasatinib, completely blocks this feedback activation, confirming convergence between Src and the mTOR pathway. Analysis in vivo revealed that dual Src and mTOR inhibition is highly effective in two mouse models of breast cancer. In a luminal disease model, combined dasatinib and rapamycin is more effective at inducing regression than either single agent. Furthermore, the combination of dasatinib and rapamycin delays tumor recurrence following the cessation of treatment. In a model of human EGFR-2-positive (HER2(+)) disease, dasatinib alone is ineffective, but potentiates the efficacy of rapamycin. These data suggest that combining mTOR and Src inhibitors may provide a new approach for treating multiple breast cancer subtypes that may circumvent resistance to targeted RTK therapies.
