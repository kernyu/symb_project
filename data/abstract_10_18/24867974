Totals of 8.7% (103/1,190) and 21.0% (249/1,190) of the Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates recovered from specimens collected in the United States during the 2011-2012 AWARE (Assessing Worldwide Antimicrobial Resistance Evaluation) Surveillance Program were ceftriaxone nonsusceptible according to the CLSI (</= 1 mug/ml for susceptible) and EUCAST (</= 0.5 mug/ml for susceptible) criteria, respectively. Decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone (MIC, 1 mug/ml) was frequently observed among serotypes 19 A (51.4%; 128/249) and 35 B (29.7%; 74/249), which were most often observed in the East South Central and South Atlantic U.S. Census regions. Ceftaroline (MIC50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml) remained active (>/= 96.8% susceptible) when tested against these less susceptible isolates.
