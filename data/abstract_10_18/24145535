The frequency of the carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii (CRACB) complex increases annually in our hospitals. However, the types and prevalence of carbapenemases among isolates still remain unclear. In this study, we identified and collected 672 carbapenem-resistant isolates from a medical center in Northern Taiwan between April and December of 2010. There were 577 genospecies 2 (Acinetobacter baumannii), 79 genospecies 13TU, and 16 genospecies 3 isolates. The isolates had an acquired blaOXA-24-like gene, which was confirmed by sequencing for the encoded OXA-72 carbapenemase, and were often associated with high-level carbapenem resistance. These CRACB complex isolates remained susceptible to colistin (100%). The genotyping of isolates was conducted using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis with ApaI digestion. In most clonally related groups, patients were from both branch hospitals. The results indicate that interhospital dissemination of clones occurred. This study provides updated data on the types and prevalence of the CRACB complex. In addition, it presents a warning on the emergence and spread of CRACB complex harboring blaOXA-24-like genes in northern Taiwan.
