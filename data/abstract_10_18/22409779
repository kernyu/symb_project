Few studies have investigated the clinical features and outcomes for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter spp., Serratia spp., and Morganella morganii (ECSM) bloodstream infections. This study was performed to investigate the clinical features and outcomes for ESBL-producing ECSM bloodstream infections. Patients with ECSM bloodstream infection were enrolled from October 2006 to March 2008. Of 124 patients with ECSM bacteremia, 30 cases (24.2%) were ESBL-producing isolates. Immunosuppressive drugs use within 30 days (p=0.028), indwelling device at the time of bacteremia (p=0.042) and antibiotics use within 3 months (p=0.022) were independently associated with ESBL production in multivariate analysis. Overall 30-day mortality rate was 19.4% (24/124). When the 30-day mortality rate was evaluated, no significant difference was found between the ESBL group (16.6%; 5/30) and non-ESBL group (20.2%; 19/94). Hospitalization was longer in the ESBL group than in the non-ESBL group (65.4+/-92.8 vs. 32.9+/-37.8 days, respectively; p=0.007). The recent use of antibiotics (especially broad-spectrum cephalosporins and other beta-lactam antibiotics) was an important risk factor for ESBL among ECSM bacteremia. ESBL production of ECSM isolates was not significantly associated with mortality but ESBL-producing organisms have an important impact on the duration of hospital stay and subsequent medical cost.
