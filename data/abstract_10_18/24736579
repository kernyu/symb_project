BACKGROUND: There has been no previous study on the activity of gemcitabine in combination with oxaliplatin (GemOx) for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). METHODS: The GemOx was preclinically tested for cytotoxic activity in human prostate cancer cell lines. Clinically, patients with CRPC who failed prior docetaxel were treated with gemcitabine 1000 mg m(-2) and oxaliplatin 100 mg m(-2) intravenously every 2 weeks and prednisolone 5 mg orally twice daily. The primary end point was the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate. RESULTS: The GemOx displayed synergistic effects based on Chou and Talalay analysis. In the phase II study, 33 patients were accrued. The median dose of docetaxel exposure was 518 mg m(-2). A total of 270 cycles were administered with a median of eight cycles per patient. A PSA response rate was 55% (95% CI, 38-72) and radiologic response rate was 82% (9 out of 11). With a median follow-up duration of 20.5 months, the median time to PSA progression was 5.8 months (95% CI, 4.4-7.2) and the median overall survival was 17.6 months (95% CI, 12.6-22.6). The most frequently observed grade 3 or 4 toxicities were neutropenia (13%) and thrombocytopenia (13%). CONCLUSIONS: The GemOx is active and tolerable in patients with metastatic CRPC after docetaxel failure (NCT 01487720).
