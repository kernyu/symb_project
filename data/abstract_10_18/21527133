Multidrug- (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) are reported to gradually spread across European countries with low TB prevalence including France. Some isolates may even accumulate traits of resistance in addition to the XDR profile, as a result of therapeutic mismanagement. We report here the first case of XDR TB in Marseilles and discuss the potential effectiveness of sulfamide treatment in such cases.
