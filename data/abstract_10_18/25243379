Wheat Dn genes afford resistance to the economically important pest, Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov, Russian wheat aphid, RWA) and have been the topic of transcriptomic and proteomic studies aimed at unraveling the pathways involved in resistance. The antibiotic resistance conveyed by Dn1 is characterized by a hypersensitive response (HR) followed by systemic acquired resistance (SAR). Although many candidate genes differentially expressed during the Dn1-mediated resistance response have been identified, few have been functionally verified. The aim of this study was to silence three HR-associated candidate genes in Dn1 containing wheat using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS): thylakoid-associated ascorbate peroxidase (tAPX), phi-class glutathione-S-transferase (TaGSTF6) and superoxide dismutase Cu/Zn (SOD). D. noxia fertility was used as a measure of antibiotic resistance. Silencing of SOD Cu/Zn had little effect on D. noxia fertility, while increased aphid reproduction was recorded on tAPX- and TaGSTF6-silenced plants. However, tAPX-silencing only affected early measurements and did not have a prolonged effect on resistance. TaGSTF6-silenced plants expressed lowered H2 O2 production in resistant wheat under infestation conditions, suggesting that TaGSTF6 and H2 O2 play an integral role in Dn1-mediated D. noxia resistance in wheat plants.
