UNLABELLED: Polymorphisms of the IL28B gene are highly associated with sustained virological response (SVR) in patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with peginterferon and ribavirin. Quantitation of interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) may also differentiate antiviral response. We evaluated IP-10 levels in pretreatment serum from 115 nonresponders and 157 sustained responders in the Study of Viral Resistance to Antiviral Therapy of Chronic Hepatitis C cohort, including African American (AA) and Caucasian American (CA) patients. Mean IP-10 was lower in sustained responders compared with nonresponders (437 +/- 31 vs 704 +/- 44 pg/mL, P < 0.001), both in AA and CA patients. The positive predictive value of low IP-10 levels (<600 pg/mL) for SVR was 69%, whereas the negative predictive value of high IP-10 levels (>600 pg/mL) was 67%. We assessed the combination of pretreatment IP-10 levels with IL28B genotype as predictors of treatment response. The IL28B polymorphism rs12979860 was tested in 210 participants. The CC, CT, and TT genotypes were found in 30%, 49%, and 21% of patients, respectively, with corresponding SVR rates of 87%, 50%, and 39% (P < 0.0001). Serum IP-10 levels within the IL28B genotype groups provided additional information regarding the likelihood of SVR (P < 0.0001). CT carriers with low IP-10 had 64% SVR versus 24% with high IP-10. Similarly, a higher SVR rate was identified for TT and CC carriers with low versus high IP-10 (TT, 48% versus 20%; CC, 89% versus 79%). IL28B genotype and baseline IP-10 levels were additive but independent when predicting SVR in both AA and CA patients. CONCLUSION: When IL28B genotype is combined with pretreatment serum IP-10 measurement, the predictive value for discrimination between SVR and nonresponse is significantly improved, especially in non-CC genotypes. This relationship warrants further investigation to elucidate the mechanisms of antiviral response and prospective validation.
