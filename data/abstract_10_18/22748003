We describe the second case in Europe of verified treatment failure of pharyngeal gonorrhoea, caused by an internationally occurring multidrug-resistant gonococcal clone, with recommended first-line ceftriaxone 250 mg in Slovenia. This is of grave concern since ceftriaxone is last remaining option for empirical treatment. Increased awareness of ceftriaxone failures, more frequent test-of-cure, strict adherence to regularly updated treatment guidelines, and thorough verification/falsification of suspected treatment failures are essential globally. New effective treatment options are imperative.
