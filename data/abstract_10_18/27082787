Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-A. baumannii complex (ACB complex) is a nosocomial pathogen. Due to its high ability to develop antibiotic resistance, it has become a problematic challenge in the modern healthcare system. The molecular and genetic mechanisms of gaining multidrug resistance in ACB complex are well known. This study focuses on providing an overview of the antibiotic resistance profiles, genetic similarities and resistotypes, and general characteristics of carbapenem-resistant ACB complex (CRACB) in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). In light of the data collected in this study, together with the already known information concerning antibiotic resistance of ACB complex, we intend to further elucidate the antibiotic therapy for CRACB strain resistotypes in BiH.
