Exposure of human monocytes/macrophages to anti-inflammatory agents, such as IL-10 or glucocorticoids, can lead to two separate fates: either Fas/CD95-mediated apoptosis or differentiation into regulatory and efferocytic M2c (CD14(bright)CD16(+)CD163(+)Mer tyrosine kinase(+)) macrophages. We found that the prevalent effect depends on the type of Th cytokine environment and on the stage of monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation. In particular, the presence of IFN-gamma (Th1 inflammation) or the prolonged exposure to IL-4 (chronic Th2 inflammation) promotes apoptosis of monocytes/macrophages and causes resistance to M2c differentiation, thus provoking impaired clearance of apoptotic neutrophils, uncontrolled accumulation of apoptotic cells, and persistent inflammation. In contrast, the presence of IL-17 (Th17 environment) prevents monocyte/macrophage apoptosis and elicits intense M2c differentiation, thus ensuring efficient clearance of apoptotic neutrophils and restoration of anti-inflammatory conditions. Additionally, the Th environment affects the expression of two distinct Mer tyrosine kinase isoforms: IL-4 downregulates the membrane isoform but induces an intracellular and Gas6-dependent isoform, whereas IFN-gamma downregulates both and IL-17 upregulates both. Our data support an unexpected role for IL-17 in orchestrating resolution of innate inflammation, whereas IFN-gamma and IL-4 emerge as major determinants of IL-10 and glucocorticoid resistance.
