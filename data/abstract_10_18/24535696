Since the late 1990s, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (S. maltophilia) has become one of the most common nonfermenting Gram-negative bacilli that cause opportunistic infection. Patients with hematologic diseases are the most risky candidate for S. maltophilia pneumonia or sepsis because of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia or immunodeficiency. Frequent exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics and prolonged insertion of central venous catheter further enhance the risk of S. maltophilia infection. One of the most severe S. maltophilia infections is hemorrhagic pneumonia. This type of infection is mostly fatal because of pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage that leads to acute respiratory failure. Furthermore, S. maltophilia exhibits a high-level intrinsic resistance to conventional antibiotics such as beta-lactams and aminoglycosides and, more recently, the increasing acquired resistance to co-trimoxazole and quinolones. According to our experienced and previously reported cases, all of the patients with hemorrhagic pneumonia caused by S. maltophilia had a fatal course within a few days after the onset of the pneumonia. In this article, we perform a systematic review on a total 30 cases of hemorrhagic pneumonia induced by S. maltophilia from our institutions and the literature, and we describe its early diagnosis, prophylaxis, and recommended therapeutic strategy for the infection in the treatment of hematologic disease.
