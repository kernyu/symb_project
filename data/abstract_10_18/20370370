Cryptococcus neoformans causes disseminated infection in 7-8% of HIV positive patients admitted to Hospital F. J. Muniz in Buenos Aires. Meningoencephalitis is the most frequent clinical manifestation and is one of the main causes of death in those patients with AIDS. The standard treatment for this mycosis consists of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole until two successive cultures of CFS are negative. Although resistance to these drugs is infrequent, minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of some antifungals can be high. Since it is important to know the susceptibility levels of this fungus to the antifungal drugs usually employed in our institution, we analyzed the susceptibility test results of C. neoformans with two diffusion methods (Etest and NeoSensitabs tablets) employing Mueller-Hinton agar with 2% glucose and 0.5 microg/ml methylene blue. These results were compared with MICs obtained through the use of the broth microdilution reference method (CLSI). Results showed good agreement with the reference method, with no very major errors and only two major errors for fluconazole using NeoSensitabs tablets. For all the above mentioned, we confirm the usefulness of Mueller-Hinton agar to evaluate C. neoformans susceptibility to amphotericin B and fluconazole with these two agar diffusion methods.
