BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) is an opportunistic microorganism. This study aimed to investigate the presence of magA gene and antimicrobial susceptibility in K. pneumoniae. MATERIALS AND METHODS: clinical specimens were collected from hospitals of Shahrekord, Iran. Bacterial culture, biochemical diagnostic standard test, determination of antibiotic sensitivity, phenotypic testing hypermucoviscosity (HV) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed for isolation and characterization of K. pneumoniae. RESULTS: 173 samples were positive for K. pneumoniae. The highest and lowest rates of resistance were related to amoxicillin 79.19% and ciprofloxacin 15.60%, respectively. Also 4 samples were positive for magA gene. CONCLUSION: Based on our results, K. pneumoniae strains were resistant to different antibiotics. Knowing how to identify strains of K. pneumoniae, spreading of its virulence and also antimicrobial resistance genes can be useful in treatment of infection caused by this bacterium.
