While fluoroquinolones (FQs) have been successful in helping cure multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB), studies in mice have suggested that if used as first-line agents they might reduce the duration of therapy required to cure drug-sensitive TB. The results of phase II trials with FQs as first-line agents have been mixed, but in at least three studies where moxifloxacin substituted for ethambutol, there was an increase in the early percentage of sputa that converted to negative for bacilli. Phase III trials are in progress to test the effectiveness of 4-month FQ-containing regimens, but there is concern that the widespread use of FQs for other infections could engender a high prevalence of FQ-resistant TB. However, several studies suggest that despite wide FQ use, the prevalence of FQ-resistant TB is low, and the majority of the resistance is low-level. The principal risk for resistance may be when FQs are used to treat nonspecific respiratory symptoms that are in fact TB, so curtailing this use of FQs could reduce the development of resistance and also the delays in TB diagnosis and treatment that have been documented when an FQ is given in this setting. While the future of FQs as first-line therapy will likely depend upon the results of the ongoing phase III trials, if they are to be effectively employed in high-TB-burden regions their use for community-acquired pneumonias should be restricted, the prevalence of FQ-resistant TB should be monitored, and the cost of the treatment should be comparable to that of current standard drug regimens.
