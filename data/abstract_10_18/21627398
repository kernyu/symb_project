BACKGROUND: Resistance to clarithromycin, a component of standard triple therapy, leads to inconsistent eradication rates of Helicobacter pylori infection. Some studies have shown higher eradication rates for H. pylori using sequential regimen. This study was done to compare the eradication rates for H. pylori infection between the standard triple drug therapy and the sequential therapy. METHODS: Seventy-three patients with perforated duodenal ulcer following simple closure with H. pylori infection were randomized to receive either standard triple drug therapy or the sequential therapy. Standard triple drug therapy comprised of omeprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin for 10 days. Sequential therapy comprised of omeprazole and amoxicillin or the first 5 days followed by omeprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin for the next 5 days. Follow-up endoscopy was done at 2 months to assess the eradication rates, compliance, and side effects with each regimen. RESULTS: Eradication rates for standard triple therapy and sequential regimen were 81.25% and 87.09%, respectively (p = 0.732). The cost of sequential therapy was cheaper and incidence of side effects and compliance were similar in each group. CONCLUSION: Standard triple therapy and sequential therapy have similar efficacy for eradication of H. pylori and sequential therapy is an economical alternative to standard triple therapy.
