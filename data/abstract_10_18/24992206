BACKGROUND: This study aimed to clarify the clinical significance of drug-resistant HBV in nucleoside/nucleotide analogue (NA)-naive Chinese patients with chronic HBV infection in real clinical practice. METHODS: A total of 845 NA-naive patients who were admitted to Beijing 302 Hospital between July 2007 and March 2012 were included in the study. HBV drug-resistant mutations were examined by direct sequencing of the viral reverse transcriptase gene and verified by clonal sequencing. Phenotypic analysis of viral replication capacity and drug susceptibility were performed by measuring viral replicative intermediate level in 1.1-mer mutant or wild-type HBV amplicon-transfected HepG2 cells in absence or presence of serially diluted drugs. RESULTS: Drug-resistant mutations were detected in 2.01% (17/845) of the patients by direct sequencing, including 15 with lamivudine-resistant mutations (rtM204V, rtM204I), one with adefovir-resistant mutation (rtA181V), and one with both lamivudine- and adefovir-resistant mutations (rtA181V, rtM204I). Clonal sequencing identified 13 drug-resistant HBV strains: rtL80I+M204I, rtL80I+M204V, rtL180M+M204I, rtL180M+M204V, rtM204I, rtM204V, rtL80I+L180M+M204I, rtL80I+L180M+M204V, rtA181V, rtA181V+M204I, rtA181T+N236T, rtA181V+N236T and rtN236T. Phenotypic analysis showed that two pre-existing lamivudine-resistant strains (rtL80I+M204I, rtL180M+M204V) had >1,000-fold resistance to lamivudine, and one pre-existing adefovir-resistant strain (rtA181V+N236T) had 15.4-fold resistance to adefovir compared with the wild-type strain. A follow-up study showed that the presence of pre-existing rtM204I strain in one patient increased from 20% at baseline to 85% after 13 months of entecavir treatment with corresponding recession of wild-type strain in the viral pool. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of drug-resistant HBV mutations was low in NA-naive Chinese HBV-infected patients. Pre-existing mutants had similar resistance characteristics to those from NA refractory patients.
