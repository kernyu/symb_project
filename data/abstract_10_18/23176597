Malaria is a severe infectious disease that causes between 655,000 and 1.2 million deaths annually. To overcome the resistance to current drugs, new biological targets are needed for drug development. Aminopeptidase M1 (PfAM1), a zinc metalloprotease, has been proposed as a new drug target to fight malaria. Herein, we disclosed the structure-activity relationships of a selective family of hydroxamate PfAM1 inhibitors based on the malonic template. In particular, we performed a "fluoro-scanning" around hit 1 that enlightened the key positions of the halogen for activity. The docking of the best inhibitor 2 is consistent with in vitro results. The stability of 2 was evaluated in microsomes, in plasma, and toward glutathione. The in vivo distribution study performed with the nanomolar hydroxamate inhibitor 2 (BDM14471) revealed that it reaches its site of action. However, it fails to kill the parasite at concentrations relevant to the enzymatic inhibitory potency, suggesting that killing the parasite remains a challenge for potent and druglike catalytic-site binding PfAM1 inhibitors. In all, this study provides important insights for the design of inhibitors of PfAM1 and the validity of this target.
