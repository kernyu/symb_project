Recent studies have demonstrated that some morphologically atypical Aspergillus fumigatus strains are different species belonging to the section Fumigati. Aspergillus lentulus, one of these sibling species, is increasingly reported in patients under corticosteroid treatment. MICs of most antifungals in clinical use are elevated against A. lentulus, and it shows primary resistance to azole drugs. Two A. lentulus cytochrome P450 14-alpha sterol demethylases, encoded by A. lentulus cyp51A (Alcyp51A) and Alcyp51B genes, were identified. Targeted cyp51A gene knockout in A. lentulus showed that the intrinsic azole resistance of this species is cyp51A dependent. The Deltacyp51A strain was morphologically indistinguishable from the A. lentulus wild-type strain, retaining the ability to cause pulmonary disease in neutropenic mice. The heterologous expression of A. lentulus cyp51A was performed in an A. fumigatus cyp51A-deficient strain, confirming that Cyp51A is responsible for the differences in A. lentulus-azole drug interaction.
