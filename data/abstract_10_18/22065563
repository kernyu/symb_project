A functional substrate capable of regulating protein adsorption was prepared using a crosslinked albumin (cl-albumin) film for use in the fabrication of protein micropatterns. The adsorption of proteins with different characteristics onto cl-albumin film, including serum proteins, serum albumin, and lysozyme, was investigated using a quartz crystal microbalance. The results showed that surfaces coated with cl-albumin film are highly resistant to protein adsorption, regardless of protein charge and rigidity. In addition, this adsorption-resistance property can be easily converted to promote protein adsorption by exposing the cl-albumin film to a charged polymer solution. By combining the convertible surface property of cl-albumin film and inkjet printing techniques, a precise protein micropattern was successfully fabricated on the substrate. Protein adsorption onto the wall surface of microchannels could also be suppressed or promoted by coating the surface with cl-albumin film. This approach will aid in the development of biomaterials carrying protein micropatterns, such as biosensors, biochips, and cellular scaffolds.
