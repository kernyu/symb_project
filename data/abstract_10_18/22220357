The frequent creation of antibiotic resistant bacteria through mutation poses a severe medical problem. As a way towards solving the problem, mutations conferring antibiotic sensitivity could be induced in such bacteria at very high frequency through the controlled process of environmentally responsive mutagenesis, an adaptively responsive mutator process. Such induction, as a necessary developmental stage towards global adaptation, would be enabled by patterns of mild stresses. The stresses and their patterns would be elucidated through in vitro experiments and clinical trials. The effective application of this ordered process, whose detection was allowed through a change in experimental design, requires a new and more comprehensive paradigm of mutagenesis than the one currently applied. This would be a new paradigm that has holistic and developmental features. Yet, the effective and ongoing emergence of such a paradigm will depend on experimental setups that will enable or provide, unlike previous experimental arrangements, new insights as to the developmental connections between innerly controlled mutagenesis and its environments. This should demonstrate controlled ways to generate and make manifest those genomic changes that, as developmental stages, give rise to antibiotic sensitivity in antibiotic resistant bacteria. The ultimate consequence of such a developed paradigm of mutagenesis may very well be a major and benign medical and biotechnical revolution.
