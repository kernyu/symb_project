36 Novel heterocyclic chalcone derivatives were synthesized and tested for their anti-bacterial activity. Some compounds presented good anti-microbial activities against Gram-positive bacteria (including the multidrug-resistant clinical isolates). This class of compounds presented high potency against Streptococcus mutans, among which the derivatives F2 with an MIC of 2 microg/mL was as active as the standard drug (norfloxacin) and less active than oxacillin. All the compounds did not inhibit the growth of Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli CCARM 1924 or Escherichia coli CCARM 1356) at 64 microg/mL.
