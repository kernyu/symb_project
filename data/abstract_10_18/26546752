Infection with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a serious medical problem, particularly in immunocompromised individuals and neonates. The success of standard antiviral therapy is hampered by low drug compatibility and induction of viral resistance. A novel strategy is based on the exploitation of cell-directed signaling inhibitors. The broad antiinfective drug artesunate (ART) offers additional therapeutic options such as oral bioavailability and low levels of toxic side-effects. Here, novel ART-derived compounds including dimers and trimers were synthesized showing further improvements over the parental drug. Antiviral activity and mechanistic aspects were determined leading to the following statements: (i) ART exerts antiviral activity towards human and animal herpesviruses, (ii) no induction of ART-resistant HCMV mutants occurred in vitro, (iii) chemically modified derivatives of ART showed strongly enhanced anti-HCMV efficacy, (iv) NF-kappaB reporter constructs, upregulated during HCMV replication, could be partially blocked by ART treatment, (v) ART activity analyzed in stable reporter cell clones indicated an inhibition of stimulated NF-kappaB but not CREB pathway, (vi) solid-phase immobilized ART was able to bind to NF-kappaB RelA/p65, and (vii) peptides within NF-kappaB RelA/p65 represent candidates of ART binding as analyzed by in silico docking and mass spectrometry. These novel findings open new prospects for the future medical use of ART and ART-related drug candidates.
