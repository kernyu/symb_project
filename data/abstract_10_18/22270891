Although biofilms are often associated with hospital infection problems owing to their high resistance to antimicrobial agents, in recent years biofilms have also been studied in the industrial sector, mainly because they are a major cause of contamination outbreaks in facilities and products. The aim of this study was to investigate whether different materials commonly found in the metalworking industries have different biofilm formation characteristics when in contact with contaminated cutting fluid as well as to establish an optimal concentration of a triazine-based antimicrobial agent to protect the oil/water emulsion and also to delay or interrupt the development of biofilms. Biofilms grown on the surface of carbon steel, stainless steel, aluminum, polyvinyl chloride, and glass were analyzed in terms of cell growth and susceptibility to the tested biocide. The results showed that the type of material used had little influence on cell adhesion or on the microbicide concentration required to control and eradicate microorganisms suspended in the emulsion and in the biofilms.
