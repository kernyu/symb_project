South Korean isolates of oseltamivir-resistant influenza viruses from 2005-2010 were investigated with a total 491 influenza viruses identified from 1702 specimens. Neuraminidase genes from 342 influenza viruses (71 A/H1N1, 74 pandemic A/H1N1 2009, 117 A/H3N2, and 80 B) were analyzed by RT-PCR with molecular markers for oseltamivir resistance. The H274Y mutation in the NA protein was identified in 100 % (n=40) of A/H1N1 viruses circulating in 2008-2009. Influenza A/H1N1 viruses harboring the H274Y substitution exhibited, on average, a 626-fold reduction in oseltamivir susceptibility and clustered with the A/Norway/1736/2007 strain. Close and timely monitoring for resistance to clinically available influenza antivirals should be consistently performed.
