HIV Attachment. In this cross section, HIV is shown at the top and a target cell is shown at the bottom in blues. HIV envelope protein (A) has bound to the receptor CD4 (B) and then to coreceptor CCR5 (C), causing a change in conformation that inserts fusion peptides into the cellular membrane Antiretroviral therapy changed the face of HIV/AIDS from that of soon and certain death to that of a chronic disease in the years following introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy in 1995-1996 (initially termed HAART, but now most often abbreviated to ART since not all combinations of regimens are equally active). Since then, many new agents have been developed and introduced in response to problems of resistance, toxicity, and tolerability, and great advances have been achieved in accessibility of HIV drugs in resource-poor global regions. Potential challenges that providers of HIV therapy will face in the coming decade include continuing problems with resistance, especially where access to drugs is inconsistent, determining how best to combine new and existing agents, defining the role of preventive treatment (pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP), and evaluating the potential of strategies for cure in some populations.
