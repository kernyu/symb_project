Solithromycin, a next-generation macrolide and novel fluoroketolide, was tested against a 2012 collection of serotyped U.S. macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates associated with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). Against all 272 isolates, solithromycin demonstrated high potency (MIC50/90, 0.06/0.25 mug/ml), and it inhibited all strains at MICs of </=0.5 mug/ml, including the two most prevalent macrolide-resistant serotypes (19A and 35B). These data support the continued clinical development of solithromycin for the treatment of multidrug-resistant CABP.
