We aimed to determine whether the results of surveillance cultures were associated with use of appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy among patients with carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infections. We found that surveillance status was not associated with appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy (P=.36). There were significant delays to concordant therapy among surveillance-positive patients (P=.03).
