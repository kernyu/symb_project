To determine the epidemiological pattern of antibiotic resistance strains of S. Pneumoniae studied the sensitivity of nasopharyngeal isolates of pneumococci isolated from healthy children attending sports clubs Karaganda region. The frequency of allocation of pneumococci was 35.57%. In accordance with the values of the minimum inhibitory concentration resistant pneumococci was: penicillin - 5.41%, erythromycin - 8.1%, clindamycin - 4.05%, amoxicillin-6.76%, tetracycline 28.38%. Resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in the studied children is not a significant problem. Worthy of attention is the high proportion of resistance to tetracycline, which has recently been used for medical purposes much less than macrolides and betalaktamy. This finding suggests the presence of other resistance mechanisms of formation.
