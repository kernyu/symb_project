Due to their ability to rapidly mutate, influenza viruses quickly develop resistance against many antiviral substances, leading to an urgent need for new compounds. The trimeric viral polymerase complex, a major target for the development of new inhibitors, must be assembled from the PB1, PB2, and PA subunits for successful infection. Here, we describe ELISA-based assays which allow the identification of peptides which impair polymerase complex formation. Since the protein-protein interaction domains of the viral polymerase are highly conserved, these inhibitors are also predicted to be active against a broad range of influenza strains. Using this method, identification of small molecules and lead compounds against influenza A and B viruses should be feasible.
