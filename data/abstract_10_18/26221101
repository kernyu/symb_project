UNLABELLED: Public health is facing a new challenge due to the alarming increase in bacterial resistance to most of the conventional antibacterial agents. It has been found that only minor cell damage is caused when exposed to sub-lethal levels of antimicrobial. Biofilms can play an important role in producing resistance, which is developed to reservoirs of pathogens in the hospital and cannot be easily removed. The aim of this study was to test whether the sub-lethal dose of antibiotics can induce biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa following incubating in the presence and absence of chlorhexidine. Standard antibiotic-micro broth 96-flat well plates were used for determination of MIC and biofilm assay. The adherence degree of biofilm was determined by estimation of OD 630 nm values using ELISA reader. The mean 22 isolates of P. aeruginosa growing in culture with presence and absence of chlorhexidine, could exhibited the significant (p < 0.001) proportion of adherence followed incubation in sub minimal inhibitory concentrations (Sub-MIC) of cefotaxim, amoxicillin, and azithromycin in comparison with control (antibiotic-free broth), while the sub-MIC of ciprofloxacin revealed significant inhibition of biofilm. CONCLUSION: Incubating the isolates of P. aeruginosa to sub-MIC of antibiotics exhibited induction of biofilm in the presence of chlorhexidine.
