Antibiograms of urine cultures are being used to guide empiric treatment for urinary tract infections (UTI). However, roughly 50% of urine cultures are from patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU). It is unclear whether enterobacteriaceae in ABU patients have similar resistance patterns as UTI patients. Hence, we aimed to compare the antimicrobial resistance patterns in patients with ABU to patients with symptomatic UTI. We found no major differences in resistance patterns, and therefore, empiric treatment choices can be guided by antibiograms that include ABU patients.
