Between 2009 and 2016, 317 and 529 swabs from cattle and pig carcasses, respectively, were collected all over Poland and tested for the presence of Campylobacter. Among 37 (11.7%) and 161 (30.4%) positive samples, 44 Campylobacter jejuni isolates were detected. A total of 29 different sequence types (STs) and 12 various clonal complexes were identified. Antimicrobial resistance revealed that 17 (38.6%) C. jejuni (10 from cattle and 7 from pig carcasses, respectively) were susceptible to all antimicrobials used in the study, whereas the remaining 27 (61.4%) isolates (12 from cattle and 15 from pigs, respectively) were resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent, mainly to quinolones (23 out of 44 isolates; 52.3%) and tetracyclines (14 strains; 31.8%). Only one isolate from cattle and two from pigs displayed resistance to streptomycin, and none of C. jejuni tested was resistant to erythromycin and gentamicin. All isolates with STs, ST356, ST443, ST464, ST658, ST2036, and ST6411, as well as some isolates belonging to ST257 and ST1947, were resistant to quinolones and tetracyclines. The results show that cattle and pigs may be a reservoir of quinolone and tetracycline resistant C. jejuni with STs which were previously isolated from humans with campylobacteriosis.
