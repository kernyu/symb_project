We describe a new phenotypic test to detect beta-lactamases. This assay is based on diffusion of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase through a bacterial filter. Beta-lactam hydrolysis on (the other side of) the filter leads to a change in antibiotic susceptibility, which can be measured by disc diffusion tests. We illustrate its ease of use to detect beta-lactamases of different classes.
