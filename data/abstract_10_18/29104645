Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous Gram negative opportunistic pathogen capable of causing severe nosocomial infections in humans, and tobramycin is currently used to treat P. aeruginosa associated lung infections. Quorum sensing regulates biofilm formation which allows the bacterium to result in fatal infections forcing clinicians to extensively use antibiotics to manage its infections leading to emerging multiple drug resistant strains. As a result, tobramycin is also becoming resistant. Despite extensive studies on drug discovery to alleviate microbial drug resistance, the continued microbial evolution has forced researchers to focus on screening various phytochemicals and dietary compounds for antimicrobial potential. Linolenic acid (LNA) is an essential fatty acid that possesses antimicrobial actions on various microorganisms. It was hypothesized that LNA may affect the formation of biofilm on P. aeruginosa and improve the potency of tobramycin. The present study demonstrated that LNA interfered with cell-to-cell communication and reduced virulence factor production. It further enhanced the potency of tobramycin and synergistically inhibited biofilm formation through P. aeruginosa quorum sensing systems. Therefore, LNA may be considered as a potential agent for adjunctive therapy and its utilization may decrease tobramycin concentration in combined treatment thereby reducing aminoglycoside adverse effects.
