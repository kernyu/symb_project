A relevant fraction of HIV-1-infected individuals (ranging from 15 to 30%) presenting virologically successful highly active antiretroviral therapy fail to recover CD4 T-cell counts. These individuals, called immunodiscordant or immunological nonresponders, are at increased risk of clinical progression and death. Although older age, lower nadir CD4 T-cell count and HCV co-infection are some of clinical predictive factors, immunological mechanisms rely on impaired thymic production and accumulation of apoptosis-prone CD4 T cells. Indeed, immunodiscordant individuals may show increased tissue fibrosis and damage of gut-associated lymphoid tissue that results in higher hyperactivation, inflammation and immunosenescence, altered Treg/Th17 ratio and increased T-cell death. A better knowledge of the final pathogenic mechanism and factors influencing CD4 T-cell recovery will help to select the optimal therapeutic strategies for them.
