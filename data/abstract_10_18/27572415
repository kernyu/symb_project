The coexistence of qnrB62 and blaVIM-2 was detected in a Citrobacter clinical isolate. The reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility is attributable to qnrB62, mutations of quinolone-resistance-determining regions, and an efflux pump or pumps. The genetic context surrounding chromosomal qnrB62 was a novel complex class 1 integron (In1184::ISCR1::qnrB62) containing a unique gene array (blaVIM-2-aacA4'-8-gucD). An 18-nucleotide deletion at the 3' end of the pspA gene [pspA(Delta18)], upstream of qnrB62, and an inverted repeat region (IRR2) were detected in In1184::ISCR1::qnrB62, indicating past transposition events.
