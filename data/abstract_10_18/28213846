Bioprosthetic heart valves (BHVs), derived from glutaraldehyde crosslinked (GLUT) porcine aortic valve leaflets or bovine pericardium (BP), are used to replace defective heart valves. However, valve failure can occur within 12-15 years due to calcification and/or progressive structural degeneration. We present a novel fabrication method that utilizes carbodiimide, neomycin trisulfate, and pentagalloyl glucose crosslinking chemistry (TRI) to better stabilize the extracellular matrix of BP. We demonstrate that TRI-treated BP is more compliant than GLUT-treated BP. GLUT-treated BP exhibited permanent geometric deformation and complete alteration of apparent mechanical properties when subjected to induced static strain. TRI BP, on the other hand, did not exhibit such permanent geometric deformations or significant alterations of apparent mechanical properties. TRI BP also exhibited better resistance to enzymatic degradation in vitro and calcification in vivo when implanted subcutaneously in juvenile rats for up to 30 days.
