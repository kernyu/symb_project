INTRODUCTION: Reports of increasing resistance of uropathogens to antimicrobials is of global concern. Culture and drug susceptibility tests remain a vital guide to effective therapy. The aim of this study was to determine the susceptibility pattern of isolated uropathogens to ciprofloxacin at the Ghana Police Hospital. METHODS: A total of 705 mid-stream urine samples were collected from patients suspected of having urinary tract infection, and visited the Ghana Police Hospital's laboratory from December 2013 to March 2014. Samples were cultured and isolates identified by standard methods, after which isolates susceptibility to ciprofloxacin was determined. RESULTS: Prevalence of urinary tract infection among patients' whose samples were analyzed was 15.9%. Predominant uropathogens isolated were E. coli (46.4%), Coliform (41.1%) and Coliform spp. with Candida (6.2%). Other isolates were Pseudomonas spp. (2.7%), Salmonella spp. (1.8%), Candida spp. (0.9%) and Klebsiella spp (0.9%). The overall resistance among the top three isolated uropathogens to ciprofloxacin was 35.9%. Resistance pattern demonstrated by respective isolates to ciprofloxacin were: E. coli (38.5%), Coliform (54.3%), and Coliform spp. with Candida (15%). The other isolates showed 100% sensitivity. CONCLUSION: This study revealed a relatively high ciprofloxacin resistance among isolated uropathogens, hence, the need for prudent prescribing and use of ciprofloxacin in urinary tract infection management.
