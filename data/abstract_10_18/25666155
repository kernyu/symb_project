We investigated the effect of combining the dolutegravir-specific R263K integrase resistance substitution with either M184I or M184V, two reverse transcriptase drug resistance substitutions that are frequently detected in individuals failing therapeutic regimens containing either lamivudine or emtricitabine. The presence of R263K and M184I/V in a single virus resulted in substantial further decreases in the viral replicative capacity compared to that in the presence of single substitutions alone.
