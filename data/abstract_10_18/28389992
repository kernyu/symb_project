Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is the most common illness among chronic disorders that remains poorly understood from a pathogenic standpoint and has a significant impact on patient quality of life, as well as healthcare costs. Despite being widespread, little is known about the etiology of the CRS. Recent evidence, showing the presence of biofilms within the paranasal sinuses, suggests a role for biofilm in the pathogenesis. To elucidate the role of biofilm in the pathogenesis of CRS, we assessed the presence of biofilm at the infection site and the ability of the aerobic flora isolated from CRS patients to form biofilm in vitro. For selected bacterial strains the susceptibility profiles to antibiotics in biofilm condition was also evaluated.Staphylococci represented the majority of the isolates obtained from the infection site, with S. epidermidis being the most frequently isolated species. Other isolates were represented by Enterobacteriaceae or by species present in the oral flora. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) of the mucosal biopsies taken from patients with CRS revealed the presence of biofilm in the majority of the samples. Strains isolated from the specific infection site of the CRS patients were able to form biofilm in vitro at moderate or high levels, when tested in optimized conditions. No biofilm was observed by CLSM in the biopsies from control patients, although the same biopsies were positive for staphylococci in microbiological culture analysis. Drug-susceptibility tests demonstrated that the susceptibility profile of planktonic bacteria differs from that of sessile bacteria in biofilms.
