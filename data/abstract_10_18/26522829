A prospective study was conducted in Brazil to evaluate antimicrobial resistance patterns and molecular epidemiology of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with chronic lung infection. All isolates were obtained between May 2009 and June 2010 from 75 patients seen in four reference centers in Brazil: HCPA (20 patients) and HEOM (15 patients), located in southern and northeastern Brazil, respectively; IFF (20 patients) and HUPE (20 patients), both in southwestern Brazil. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, PCR for detection of carpapenemases, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were performed in 274 isolates. A total of 224 PFGE types were identified and no clones were found circulating among the centers or within the same center. Despite the chronic infection, most patients were colonized by intermittent clones. Only three patients (4%) maintained the same clone during the study. The resistance rates were lower than 30% for the majority of antimicrobials tested in all centers and only 17% of isolates were multiresistant. Isolates (n = 54) with reduced susceptibility to imipenem and/or meropenem presented negative results for blaSPM-1, blaIMP-1, blaVIM , and blaKPC genes. Our results indicate an unexpected low level of antimicrobial resistance and a high genotypic diversity among P. aeruginosa from Brazilian chronic CF patients.
