BACKGROUND: The occurrence of antibiotic resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates is a serious public health problem in different corners of the globe. The objective of this study was to analyze the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of N. gonorrhoeae in Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of N. gonorrhoeae isolated from genital swabs of patients referred to the Amhara Regional Health Research Laboratory between September 2006 and June 2012 in Bahir Dar, Ethiopia. A structured check list was used to collect socio-demographic and laboratory variables. Data were analyzed using SPSS software version 16. RESULTS: Out of 352 genital specimens processed, 29 clinical strains of N. gonorrhoeae were identified. The percentage of N. gonorrhoeae isolates non-susceptible to ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline and penicillin G was 27.8%, 40.9%, 92.6% and 94.4% respectively. Twenty percent of the isolates were found to be non-susceptible to both ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin. Non-susceptibility to an injectable cephalosporin and any two of quinolones, penicillins or tetracyclines was observed in 27.8% of the isolates. The percentage of N. gonorrhoeae which were non-susceptible to tetracycline or penicillin G was high throughout the study period. However, the percentage of fluoroquinolone or cephalosporine non-susceptible strains showed an increasing trend. CONCLUSIONS: A high percentage of N. gonorrhoeae isolated from genital specimens in Northwest Ethiopia are non-susceptible to an injectable cephalosporin and any two of quinolones, penicillins or tetracyclines. Treatment of gonorrhea in the study area needs to be guided by antibiotic susceptibility testing of isolates.
