INTRODUCTION: Resistant infections, especially those involving the bloodstream, are associated with a greater use of resources. Their estimates are variable and depend on the methodology used. Staphylococcus aureus is the main pathogen isolated in blood in our hospitals. There is no consolidated data about economic implications of methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection. OBJECTIVE: To describe the cost of care of methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteremia in a reference population from nine hospitals in Bogota. Materials y methods: A multicenter cohort study included 204 patients in a 1:1 ratio according to resistance. Direct medical costs were calculated from hospitalization bills, while the bacteremia period was calculated by applying microcosting based on standard fares. RESULTS: We found no significant differences between groups in demographic and clinical characteristics, except for resistance risk factors. Fifty-three percent of patients died during hospitalization. Hospital stay and total invoiced value during hospitalization were significantly higher in the group with methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteremia. For this group, higher costs in ICU stay, antibiotics use, intravenous fluids, laboratory tests and respiratory support were recorded. A crude increase of 31% and an adjusted increase of 70% in care costs associated with methicillin resistance were registered. CONCLUSION: Our study supports decision makers in finding and funding infection prevention programs, especially those infections caused by resistant organisms.
