We previously reported isolating vancomycin (VAN) highly resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) strains from clinical methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains by repeating steps of in vitro mutagenesis and VAN selection. Here we describe that the in vitro susceptibility of these VRSA strains to VAN was markedly increased by combined treatment with beta-lactams such as ceftriaxone and oxacillin. Furthermore, in an in vivo silkworm infection model with VRSA, a combination of VAN and ceftriaxone exhibited therapeutic effects, whereas a combination of VAN and oxacillin did not. These findings suggest that combining VAN with an appropriate beta-lactam, such as ceftriaxone, is therapeutically effective against infectious diseases caused by VRSA.
