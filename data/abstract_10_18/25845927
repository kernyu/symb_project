PURPOSE: We determined the prevalence of ESBL Enterobacteriaceae in urinary tract infections among inpatients, identified risk factors of acquisition, and evaluated the effectiveness of alternatives to carbapenems. METHODS: The clinical, microbiological, and therapeutic data as well as the outcomes were recorded for all ESBL-E positive urine samples for three months. RESULTS: Thirty-one (4%) of the 762 Enterobacteriaceae positive cultures were ESBL producers. The predisposing conditions for being infected with those strains were: immunodepression (61%), recent hospitalization (52%), recent antibiotic therapy (52%), and urinary catheterization (61%). 19% of infections were community acquired. The seven cases of acute pyelonephritis and five of prostatitis were treated with piperacillin-tazobactam (5), fluoroquinolones (4), ceftazidime (2), or carbapenems (only 1) after specialized advice. Four (33%) patients relapsed at week 10: three were immunodepressed and three presented with bacteremia. CONCLUSIONS: Alternatives to carbapenems (especially piperacillin-tazobactam) seem to be a good option for non-bacteremic UTI in immunocompetent patients.
