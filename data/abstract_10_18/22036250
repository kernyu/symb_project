The main objectives in childhood urinary tract infections are rapid recovery from complaints, prevention of urosepsis and infection-related complications as well as the prevention of renal parenchymal damage. Calculated antibiotic therapy should take the local resistance rates of uropathogens into consideration. The current situation of bacterial resistances differs from region to region. In Escherichia coli, resistance rates against cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, nitrofurantoin und chinolones have been relatively low. In contrast, resistance rates against ampicillin have increased over the last 20 years. A similar trend has been observed for TMP/SMX. The choice of appropriate antibiotics, the duration of therapy and the form of application depend on age, severity of clinical symptoms and the presence of complicating factors. In early infancy, a combination of aminoglycoside/ampicillin or ceftazidime/ampicillin is commonly recommended as first-line treatment in pyelonephritis. Pyelonephritis in young infants should always be treated in a paediatric clinic. In later infancy and childhood, an oral third-generation cephalosporin can be used.
