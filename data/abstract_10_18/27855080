Here, we report the isolation of 31 Acinetobacter baumannii strains producing OXA-253 in a single large Brazilian city. These strains belonged to five different sequence types (STs), including 4 STs not previously associated with blaOXA-253 In all strains, the blaOXA-253 gene was located in a plasmid within a genetic environment similar to what was found previously in Brazil and Italy. The reported data emphasize the successful transmission of the blaOXA-253 gene through a large area and the tendency for this resistance determinant to remain in the A. baumannii population.
