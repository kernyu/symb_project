We evaluated antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of 42 Salmonella isolates from February 2012 through January 2013. We also determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of azithromycin against Salmonella isolates and compared them with corresponding disc diffusion sizes. Entire 42 isolates were sensitive to chloramphenicol, 41 (97.6%) were sensitive to cotrimoxazole and amoxicillin each. MICs for azithromycin ranged from 2 mug/ml to 24 mug/ml, corresponding zone diameters ranged from 15 mm to 33 mm and the two were significantly correlated (P = 0.001). Our results indicate that whereas, azithromycin is a potential therapeutic option, the sensitivity to the first line drugs and absence of multidrug resistance reinforce the concept of antimicrobial recycling.
