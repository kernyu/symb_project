BACKGROUND: Measuring the serum and alveolar procalcitonin level as inflammatory marker in the diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) has been taken into account. In this study, serum and alveolar procalcitonin levels in patients with suspected VAP and patients with confirmed VAP were compared. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted using 50 intubated intensive care unit (ICU) patients, connected to ventilator, from October 2014 to April 2015. 50 patients with clinical pulmonary infection score >/=6 were divided into two groups. Patients whose bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) has shown the growth of more than 104 CFU/mL were included in confirmed VAP group and other patients were included in suspected VAP group. Serum and alveolar procalcitonin levels were measured and compared between both groups. RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 69.10 +/- 42.13 with a range of 16-90 years, out of which 23 patients were male (46%) and 27 patients were female (54%). Moreover, patients' mean clinical pulmonary infection score was reported to be 7.02 +/- 1.07. There was a significant relationship between serum and alveolar procalcitonin in suspected patients and patients with an approved form of pneumonia (p = 0.001 and 0.027). Area under the curve for alveolar procalcitonin was 0.683 (sensitivity = 57%; specificity = 80%) and for serum procalcitonin 0.751 (sensitivity = 71%; specificity = 73%) for the diagnosis of VAP. CONCLUSION: According to the results of the present study, we can diagnose ventilator-associated pneumonia earlier and more accurately by measuring procalcitonin level (particularly alveolar type) in intensive care unit patients.
