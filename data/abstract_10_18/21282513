Caveolin-1 (Cav1) plays a critical role in the invasion of pathogenic microbes into host cells, yet little is known about porcine Cav1. In this study, we provide the molecular characterization of Cav1 in pigs following stimulation with LPS/polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid as well as during infection with Haemophilus parasuis. The porcine Cav1 gene is 35 kb long and is located at SSC18q21; two isoforms (Cav1-alpha and Cav1-beta) are produced by alternative splicing. Three point mutations were identified in the coding region of the gene, two of which were significantly associated with nine immunological parameters in Landrace pigs, including the Ab response against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus and lymphocyte counts. Promoter analysis indicated that NF-kappaB activates both Cav1 transcripts, but the forkhead gene family specifically regulates Cav1-beta in the pig. Porcine Cav1 is expressed ubiquitously, with Cav1-alpha more abundantly expressed than Cav1-beta in all tissues investigated. Basal expression levels of Cav1 in PBMCs are relatively similar across different pig breeds. LPS and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid markedly induced the expression of Cav1 in porcine kidney-15 cells in vitro, likely through NF-kappaB activation. Pigs infected with H. parasuis exhibited decreased expression of Cav1, particularly in seriously impaired organs such as the brain. This study provides new evidence that supports the use of Cav1 as a potential diagnostic and genetic marker for disease resistance in animal breeding. In addition, our results suggest that Cav1 may be implicated in the pathogenesis of Glasser's disease, which is caused by H. parasuis.
