OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify and determine the in vitro antifungal susceptibility testing to clotrimazole, fluconazole, and nystatin of 145 clinical isolates of Candida spp. METHODS: M27-A3 microdilution method was used to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and partial MICs (MIC50 and MIC90) of drugs. A total of 145 isolates were studied, 126 were C. albicans, 16 C. glabrata, 2 C. parapsilosis y 1 C. tropicalis. RESULTS: MIC50 and MIC90 for FLZ against C. albicans were 0.25 mg/L and 1 mg/L respectively and for C. glabrata was achieved at 8 mg/L and 16 mg/L for fluconazole. Five isolates of C. albicans and one isolate of C. tropicalis were in vitro resistant to fluconazole (M27-S4). In C. albicans MIC50 and MIC90 for clotrimazole were of 0.03 mg/L and 0.06 mg/L, respectively. These values for C. glabrata were 0.25 mg/L and 1 mg/L, respectively. Five C. glabrata and 1 C. tropicalis were in vitro resistant to clotrimazole. MIC50 and MIC90 of nystatin were of 1 mg/L and 2 mg/L, respectively for C. albicans and C. glabrata. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, C. albicans is the most frequently isolated yeast, followed by C. glabrata. The antifungals tested were found to be in vitro active for the isolates, except for 6 isolates for fluconazole and 6 to clotrimazole.
