PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to review the demographics, causative organisms, seasonal and geographic variation, and antimicrobial resistance patterns of microbial keratitis at our institution over a 4-year period. METHODS: Electronic medical records of all patients with microbial keratitis who underwent corneal culturing at a single institution in eastern Pennsylvania between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2012 were reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 311 patients representing 323 instances of infectious keratitis were analyzed. The most frequently implicated organisms in contact lens-related infections were Pseudomonas aeruginosa for bacteria and Fusarium species for fungus, compared with Staphylococcus aureus and Candida species in non-contact lens-associated bacterial infections. Bacterial keratitis occurred most frequently in spring and least frequently in winter (P = 0.024). Patients who live in large fringe metro (suburban) areas accounted for the highest proportion of infectious keratitis cases. P. aeruginosa and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus isolates were highly susceptible to fluoroquinolones, whereas 32% of coagulase-negative staphylococcus isolates tested were resistant to moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin, and all methicillin-resistant S. aureus organisms tested were resistant to these 2 fluoroquinolones. No organisms tested were resistant to tobramycin, gentamicin, or vancomycin. No fungal infections tested were resistant to voriconazole. CONCLUSIONS: Most infectious keratitis occurred in nonwinter months and in patients from suburban counties. Although fluoroquinolones were effective against the most common bacteria, staphylococcal species exhibited a high rate of resistance, representing a therapeutic challenge given the increasing use of fluoroquinolones as first-line monotherapy. No organisms tested were resistant to tobramycin, gentamicin, vancomycin, or voriconazole.
