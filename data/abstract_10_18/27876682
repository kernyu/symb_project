BACKGROUND: Few studies investigated the role of mycophenolate mofetil in inflammatory bowel disease, and none of them had specifically focused on patients with previous multiple intolerances and/or nonresponses to conventional immunosuppressants and biologics. AIMS: To evaluate clinical benefit and tolerability profile of mycophenolate mofetil in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and limited treatment options. METHODS: All consecutive patients with previous multiple intolerances and/or nonresponses to immunosuppressants and biologics who started an off-label treatment with mycophenolate mofetil from January 2014 to February 2016 were entered in a prospectively maintained database. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were included. Four weeks after initiation of mycophenolate mofetil therapy, a steroid-free remission was achieved in 4 patients (16.7%), while a clinical response in 13 (54.1%). At the end of follow-up, 12 patients (50.0%) remained on mycophenolate mofetil. Six achieved and maintained steroid-free remission throughout the study period (25.0%), and a further 6 patients (25.0%) achieved a clinical response with complete discontinuation of steroids. Twelve patients (50.0%) were considered as treatment failure, and five of them underwent surgery. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first experience reporting a clinical benefit and tolerability of mycophenolate mofetil in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and multiple previous failures to other immunosuppressants and/or biologics.
