The specific 26S proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib (BZ) potently induces apoptosis as well as autophagy in metastatic breast cancer cell lines such as MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468. The combined treatment of clarithromycin (CAM) and BZ significantly enhances cytotoxicity in these cell lines. Although treatment with up to 100 microg/ml CAM alone had little effect on cell growth inhibition, the accumulation of autophagosomes and p62 was observed after treatment with 25 microg/ml CAM. This result indicated that CAM blocked autophagy flux. However, the combined treatment of BZ and CAM resulted in more pronounced autophagy induction, as assessed by increased expression ratios of LC3B-II to LC3B-I and clearance of intracellular p62, than treatment with BZ alone. This combination further enhanced induction of the pro-apoptotic transcription factor CHOP (CADD153) and the chaperone protein GRP78. Knockdown of CHOP by siRNA attenuated the death-promoting effect of BZ in MDA-MB-231 cells. A wild-type murine embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell line also exhibited enhanced BZ-induced cytotoxicity with the addition of CAM, whereas a Chop knockout MEF cell line completely abolished this enhancement and exhibited resistance to BZ treatment. These data suggest that endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress mediated CHOP induction is involved in pronounced cytotoxicity by combining these reagents. Simultaneously targeting two major intracellular protein degradation pathways such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system by BZ and the autophagy-lysosome pathway by CAM may improve the therapeutic outcome in breast cancer patients via ER-stress mediated apoptosis.
