Increasing antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella species has been a serious problem for public health worldwide. This study examines Salmonella spp. recovered from foods and clinical samples on serotype, antimicrobial resistance and PFGE genotypes. It identified 91 salmonellae, belonging to 31 different serotypes, from 36 isolates from food and 55 clinical samples. Salmonella Infantis (16.5%) and Salmonella Enteritidis (13.7%) are the most common among food isolates, whereas Salmonella Enteritidis (29.0%) and Salmonella Typhimurium (16.0%) mainly causes human salmonellosis. Antimicrobial susceptibility data showed that 63.0% of the isolates were fully susceptible to 12 antibiotics tested. Nalidixic acid showed high resistance rates, 32.7% and 25.0% of the clinical isolates and food, respectively. Three main PFGE types: A (Salmonella Enteritidis), B (Salmonella Infantis) and C (Salmonella Schwarzengrund) comprised isolates recovered from foods and clinical samples. Our results indicate that the clonal groups were both causing diseases and food contamination, emphasizing the need to maintain a system of surveillance for foodborne disease.
