BACKGROUND: Health care handwashes/sanitizers help prevent the spread of infection. Many are alcohol-based, providing immediate microbial kill. Few contain persistence factors for residual antimicrobial effects. We conducted multiple studies on Viacydin-Containing Alcohol Sanitizer (VCAS) to evaluate antimicrobial properties and skin friendliness. METHODS: The potential of VCAS to cause use related skin problems was examined by repeated applications over a 3-week period. Excessive handwashing compared effects of VCAS on the skin barrier with that of other handwash products. Antimicrobial range, immediate kill rates, and resistance development were assessed as was the potential for continued antimicrobial activity over an extended period following product use. RESULTS: Our data showed the VCAS formula has broad, rapid antimicrobial efficacy without promoting microbial resistance. VCAS is mild to skin. Antimicrobial persistence testing showed that VCAS remained effective up to 6 hours postapplication. CONCLUSION: VCAS was superior to or at parity with on-market products, exhibited substantial residual effects and persistence up to 6 hours, and was safe and well tolerated. These results provide strong evidence for the value of VCAS to help prevent and eliminate pathogen contamination of the hands.
