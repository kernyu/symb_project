OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to determine urban and rural differences in overweight and obesity (OO) with diarrhea regarding subjects' sociodemographic, clinical characteristics, etiology, and antimicrobial susceptibility. METHODS: Relevant information from 2000 to 2011 were extracted from the data archive of the Diarrheal Disease Surveillance System of urban Dhaka (1248, 4.5%) and rural Matlab (615, 3.4%) hospitals of the International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b). RESULTS: The proportion of OO significantly increased in both urban (3-7%; chi-square for trend p < 0.001) and rural (1-6%; p < 0.001) areas over the study period. In multivariate modeling, monthly income more than US$100 (odds ratio [OR] = 54.44, 95% confidence interval [CI], 25.37-116.82, p < 0.001), high wealth quintile (OR = 18.23, 95% CI, 8.63-38.49, p < 0.001), access to sanitary toilet (OR = 3.07. 95% CI. 1.76-5.26. p < 0.001), boiled drinking water (OR = 2.77, 95% CI, 1.09-7.05, p = 0.032), antimicrobial use before hospitalization (OR = 4.99, 95% CI, 2.85-8.74, p < 0.001), fever (OR = 0.14, 95% CI, 0.37, 0.50, p < 0.001), watery stools (OR = 5.59, 95% CI, 2.11-14.80, p < 0.001), dehydrating diarrhea (OR = 5.17, 95% CI, 2.54-10.52, p < 0.001), intravenous saline infusion after hospitalization (OR = 2.65, 95% CI, 1.28-5.49, p = 0.009), and Salmonella infection (OR = 0.20, 95% CI, 0.50-0.83, p = 0.027) remained significantly associated with urban OO individuals. At least 88% of Shigella isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin in both urban and rural areas; for mecillinum it was 90%. Ciprofloxacin had the least detected resistance for Vibrio cholerae (0%) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) showed the greatest resistance (Dhaka 86%; Matlab 98%). Susceptibility for Salmonella showed ampicillin (95%), chloramphenecol (100%), ciprofloxacin (95%), ceftraxone (93%), TMP-SMX (95%) at both sites. CONCLUSION: Urban OO with diarrheal illnesses was significantly different from that in rural areas, including antimicrobial susceptibility.
