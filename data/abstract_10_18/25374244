BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to explore the efficacy and adverse reactions of CT-guided radioactive 125I-seed implantation treatment combined with chemotherapy for platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From September 2010 to December 2012, 23 patients with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian carcinoma were enrolled. All the patients refused, could not bear, or were not suitable for surgery. They all had no more than 3 lesions, which were detected and could also be measured by CT. All were clarified as single-lesion or multiple-lesion groups. A total of 41 lesions underwent implantation of from 8 to 106 125I seeds (median=43). Multi-plane implanting was adopted and 125I-seeds of (0.4-0.7)mCi were placed at intervals of (0.5-1.0) cm. After implantation treatment, all patients underwent 4 cycles of chemotherapy with gemcitabine 800 mg/m2 (days 1, 8 and 15). RESULTS: The outcome was evaluated with CT 3 weeks and every 3 months after implantation treatment. After 6 months, the volume of 32 out of 41 lesions (78.0%) was reduced at least 30%, within which 9 lesions completely disappeared(22.0%). Complete response was observed in 7 cases (30.4%), with a partial response in 4 cases (17.4%),4 cases stable(17.4%)and 8 cases showing progression (34.8%). The total clinical remission rate was 47.8% (11/23). The clinical remission rate was 77.8% (7/9) in the single-lesion group and 28.6% (4/14) in the multiple-lesion group with a significant difference between the two(P=0.036). The common side effects observed were mild gastrointestinal reactions. CONCLUSIONS: 125I-seed implantation combined with chemotherapy applies an effective way in the treatment of platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian epithelial carcinoma with the advantages of high local control rates, good short-term effects, little trauma and less side effects.
