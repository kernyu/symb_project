Triple therapy combining the protease inhibitor telaprevir with interferon-alpha and ribavirin is a promising new option for long-term treatment of hepatitis C. The interaction potential of telaprevir has not yet been fully elucidated. The in vitro potency of telaprevir to inhibit P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, ABCG2) was assessed and its substrate characteristics for P-gp, BCRP and the multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs, ABCCs) 1-3 were evaluated. The inducing properties of telaprevir on important drug-metabolising enzymes and transporters were also assessed and its ability to activate the pregnane X receptor (PXR) was investigated. Using growth inhibition assays, it was confirmed that telaprevir is a substrate of P-gp and it was demonstrated for the first time that it is not transported by BCRP and MRPs. Telaprevir only moderately inhibited P-gp in the calcein assay and did not inhibit BCRP in the pheophorbide A assay. In LS180 cells, telaprevir strongly induced mRNA expression of ABCG2 (4.3-fold at 30 mumol/L) and weakly induced ABCB11, CYP2C19 and UGT1A3. In contrast, telaprevir had no significant influence on mRNA expression of CYP3A4, UGT1A9, ABCB1, ABCC2 and SLCO1B1. In a reporter gene assay, telaprevir did not activate PXR. Thus, it appears unlikely that telaprevir induces CYP3A4 and P-gp in vivo in such a way as to provoke clinically relevant drug interactions. From the numerous perpetrator characteristics, telaprevir's inhibitor properties, especially of CYP3A4 and P-gp, appear to be the most relevant mechanism for drug interactions. The clinical relevance of the strong inducing effects on ABCG2 requires proper assessment.
