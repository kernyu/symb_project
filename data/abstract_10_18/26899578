Trichomoniasis is the most common non-viral sexually transmitted disease. It is associated with a wide spectrum of complications, including infertility and increased susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A rising number of reports of Trichomonas vaginalis strains resistant to metronidazole has driven the search for new compounds. In the present study, the in vitro effects of the common antiseptic octenidine dihydrochloride against T. vaginalis were tested on metronidazole-resistant and -susceptible strains. Assays were performed under microaerophilic conditions in three different media containing varying concentrations of protein. It was shown that octenidine dihydrochloride is highly effective against T. vaginalis, with no difference between metronidazole-resistant and -susceptible strains. The 50% effective concentration (EC50) values ranged from 5.7 to 21.37mug/mL after 5min, from 6.48 to 10.82mug/mL after 15min and from 0.68 to 2.11mug/mL after 30min of treatment depending on the protein concentration of the test medium. Octenidine dihydrochloride, already approved in some countries for the treatment of bacterial and fungal vaginal infections, appears to be a promising alternative treatment for trichomoniasis, particularly in mixed vaginal infections or in cases caused by metronidazole-resistant strains.
