The first International Symposium of Nanomedicine on AIDS "AIDS Treatment with Novel Anti-HIV compounds Improved by Nanotechnology" was held November 19-20, 2009 in Beijing, China. This symposium provided an international forum for presentation and discussion of exciting new advances in the emerging research area of nanobiomedical research on AIDS treatment as the focus point, as well as some issues in relevant fields such as nanobiomedical research on tumor treatment and safety evaluation of nanomedicines. Key highlights of the symposium include (1) reviewing current status of nanobiotechnology programs and their relations, more or less, with AIDS treatment; (2) reviewing current AIDS epidemiology in China and examining effectiveness and efficiency of current prevention and treatment strategies; (3) highlighting the obstacles to improve AIDS prevention and treatment, and (4) exploring innovative ways for nanotechnology to advance AIDS treatment, especially to combat HIV resistance to drugs.
