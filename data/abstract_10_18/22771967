Respiratory failure is the leading cause of death after organophosphorus poisoning. Cardiac complications are rare, serious and little known to clinicians. The authors present a case of a 74-year-old man with refractory cardiogenic shock after taking 200 mL of 80% dichlorvos for a suicide attempt. This study represents the first reported cardiogenic shock resulting from organophosphorus poisoning in the literature, clarifying its hemodynamic features with invasive hemodynamic monitoring (PiCCO; Pulsion Medical Systems AG, Munich, Germany). Additional levosimendan infusion was commenced after insufficient conventional therapies, resulting in an increase in cardiac power index by 236% and a decrease in systemic vascular resistance by 69% after 24 hours of continuous infusion. Despite the immense hemodynamic improvement after levosimendan treatment, the patient died of multiple organ failure 6 days after admission. The authors also discussed the inotropic and vasodilatory effects of levosimendan in this clinical scenario.
