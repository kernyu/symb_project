This study describes the prevalence of arrays of class 1 integron cassettes and Qnr determinants (A, B, and S) in 19 fluoroquinolone-resistant Escherichia coli isolates from chicken litter. qnrS and qnrA were the predominant genes in these fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates, and an uncommon array of aacA4-catB3-dfrA1 gene cassettes from a class1 integron was found. Additionally, aadA1 and dfrA1 gene cassettes, encoding resistance to streptomycin and trimethoprim, constituted the most common genes identified and was located on megaplasmids as well on the chromosome. Antibiotic resistance, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and plasmid data suggest a genetically diverse origin of poultry E. coli isolates.
