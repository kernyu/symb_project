BACKGROUND: Analyses of efflux pumps overexpression and mutations in quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR) in early stage of development of resistance to fluoroquinolones (FQs) are valuable to discuss countermeasures against them. We induced levofloxacin (LVFX)-resistant strains from susceptible uropathogenic Escherichia coli in vitro to analyze the mechanisms of development of FQs-resistance. METHODS: 89 strains were exposed to discontinuous elevation of LVFX dose, and mRNA level of efflux pumps and their regulators as well as mutations developed in QRDR of LVFX-resistant strains were analyzed. RESULTS: In 5 strains, a stepwise increase in MIC to LVFX (up to >128 mug/ml)was observed. Compared to the parent strains, additional mutations in QRDR were observed in the strains developing high MIC. Remarkable increase of marA expression was observed even in the early stage of LVFX-resistance development, and it lasted until high-level resistance was developed. On the other hand, moderate increase in acrB expression but only low increase in yhiU, yhiV, mdfA, tolC and sdiA were observed. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that marA expression is a sensitive marker for early detection of development of LVFX-resistance.
