The emergence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria is a serious threat with enormous social and economic implications. The distribution of resistance genes/markers through horizontal gene transfer leads to the dissemination of resistant strains in different parts of the world. The resistant bacteria acquire the ability to overcome resistance by different modes amongst which the expression of beta-lactamases is a major factor. The beta-lactamase enzymes cleave the amide bond of the beta-lactam antibiotics, which constitute about one-third of the antibiotics used all over the world. In a quest to control the spread of resistant bacteria, advanced generations of antibiotics are used either alone or in combination with inhibitors. However, these antibiotics and inhibitors also contain beta-lactam ring in their structure and hence are prone to be hydrolyzed by beta-lactamase enzymes in the near future. Thus, the severity of the problem is manifested due to the paucity of novel non-beta-lactam core containing antibiotics in the drug development stage. One approach to overcome these shortcomings is to use peptide-based inhibitors. Here, we describe the potential use of phage display technique to screen commercially available libraries to pan against beta-lactamase enzymes. The main advantage of using peptide-based inhibitors is that the bacteria will not be able to recruit pre-existing defense mechanisms and it will take a long time to evolve a new mechanism in its defense against peptide-based inhibitors.
