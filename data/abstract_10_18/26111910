In this study, two sulfated polysaccharides (S-CP1-4 and S-CP1-8) from Cyclocarya paliurus were produced by chlorosulfonic acid-pyridine method. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was used to develop an oxidative stress model in the mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7. Effects of the two sulfated polysaccharides on H2O2-induced oxidative stress were investigated. The results showed that S-CP(1-8) improved the viability of the H2O2-induced stressed RAW264.7 cells, as well as inhibited the lipid oxidation as determined by the level of malondialdehyde (MDA). Meanwhile, treatment with S-CP(1-4) increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in these cells. The sulfated polysaccharides were found to have a better protective effect against H2O2-induced oxidative stress as compared to the native polysaccharide. Scanning electron microscopy also showed a significant change in the surface morphology of sulfated polysaccharides, but the degradation of main chain of polysaccharides was unconspicuous according to the results of monosaccharide composition. In addition, the sulfated polysaccharides had noticeable DPPH radical scavenging activity. In summary, our results demonstrated that H2O2 was able to induce oxidative stress in RAW264.7 cells, and sulfated group might play an important role in resistance to H2O2-induced oxidative damage.
