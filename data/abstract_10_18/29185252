For the last few decades, multidrug resistance has become an increasing concern for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The number of new molecules has dramatically decreased and antibiotic resistance is now a priority in the international community. Facing this new threat, a large number of new as well as "old" solutions are now being discussed in the medical community to propose an alternative to antibiotic treatments. A first option is to potentiate the effect of existing molecules through combinations to circumvent the individual molecule resistance. The second option is to neutralise either the infectious agent itself or its by-products using specific antibodies. A third option is to use the pathogen signaling mechanism and inhibit the production of virulence factor through quorum sensing inhibition. A fourth pathway would be to interact with the patient's microbiota using either probiotics or faecal transplantation to modulate the innate immune response and improve response to the infectious challenge, but also to act directly against colonisation by resistant bacteria by replacing the flora with susceptible strains. The last option is to target the bacteria using phage therapy. Phages are natural viruses that specifically infect target bacteria independently of any antibiotic-susceptibility profile. In this review, we will discuss each of these options and provide the scientific rationale and the available clinical data. In the majority of cases, these treatments represent an interesting approach but not the ultimate solution to multiresistance. Well-performed clinical trials are still missing and the major priority remains to promote good use and appropriate stewardship of antibiotics to decrease resistance.
