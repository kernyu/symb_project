The study isolated three strains of intestinal autochthonous bacteria Aeromonas veronii BA-1, Vibrio lentus BA-2, and Flavobacterium sasangense BA-3 from the intestinal tract of the common carp (Cyprinus carpio). To reveal the effects of these three strains of bacteria on the innate immunity of carp, the lysozyme, complement C3, total serum protein, albumin and globulin levels, respiratory burst activity, phagocytic activity by blood leucocytes and the expression of IL-1b, lysozyme-C, and TNF-alpha were examined after feeding with seven different diets for up to 28 days. Also the survival of carp against Aeromonas hydrophila was challenged for 14 days. The carp were fed seven different diets: one control, three diets supplemented with 1 x 10(8) cell g(-1) of carp intestinal bacteria BA-1 (Group D-I), BA-2 (Group D-II) and BA-3 (Group D-III), and three diets supplemented with extracellular products FA-1 (Group E-I), FA-2 (Group E-II) and FA-3 (Group E-III) which were corresponding to the strains BA-1, BA-2, and BA-3, respectively, up to 28 days. For groups D-I, D-III, E-I and E-III, the innate immune parameters of carp were significantly increased, the expression of three immune-related genes in blood was significantly up-regulated examined during 7, 14, and 21 days of feeding, and the survival rate was improved. The study indicates that the two isolated intestinal autochthonous bacteria A. veronii BA-1 and F. sasangense BA-3 could positively influence immune response and enhance disease resistance of carp against A. hydrophila infection.
