INTRODUCTION: The purpose of the study was to isolate, identify, and determine the antimicrobial resistance of the bacterial pathogens recovered from shawarma (donair) sandwiches served to the public in Jordan. METHODOLOGY: Bacterial contamination of 100 shawarma sandwiches with pathogenic bacteria was studied by culture on selective media, serology, PCR assay, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-five bacterial isolates were identified. The predominant species was Escherichia coli (28.3%), with six isolates of serotype O157:H7, followed by Salmonella spp. (25.5%). Higher contamination rates were found in chicken sandwiches. The majority of these bacteria expressed high resistance to several antimicrobials, especially tetracycline and streptomycin. Citrobacter freundii was isolated from 15.9% and Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 8.3% of the sandwiches. The presence of these pathogens is of primary concern because some strains are capable of producing a heat-stable enterotoxin that causes food poisoning in humans, and should therefore be taken into account in risk assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Results signify the importance of sustained surveillance of foodborne pathogens in shawarma sandwiches to minimize the risk of contamination. Availability of data on the isolated pathogens and modes of transmission in food from different countries would provide a common ground for reaching international agreement on food safety regulations.
