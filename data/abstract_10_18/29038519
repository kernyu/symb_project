The respiratory pathogen nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is an important cause of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) that requires efficient treatments. A previous screening for host genes differentially expressed upon NTHi infection identified sirtuin-1, which encodes a NAD-dependent deacetylase protective against emphysema and is activated by resveratrol. This polyphenol concomitantly reduces NTHi viability, therefore highlighting its therapeutic potential against NTHi infection at the COPD airway. In this study, resveratrol antimicrobial effect on NTHi was shown to be bacteriostatic and did not induce resistance development in vitro. Analysis of modulatory properties on the NTHi-host airway epithelial interplay showed that resveratrol modulates bacterial invasion but not subcellular location, reduces inflammation without targeting phosphodiesterase 4B gene expression, and dampens beta defensin-2 gene expression in infected cells. Moreover, resveratrol therapeutics against NTHi was evaluated in vivo on mouse respiratory and zebrafish septicemia infection model systems, showing to decrease NTHi viability in a dose-dependent manner and reduce airway inflammation upon infection, and to have a significant bacterial clearing effect without signs of host toxicity, respectively. This study presents resveratrol as a therapeutic of particular translational significance due to the attractiveness of targeting both infection and overactive inflammation at the COPD airway.
