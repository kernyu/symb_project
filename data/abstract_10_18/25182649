Of 26 tigecycline-nonsusceptible Klebsiella pneumoniae (TNSKP) clinical isolates, 25 had nonsynonymous mutations in ramR and/or acrR (23 in ramR and 10 in acrR). Eight TNSKP isolates possessed overexpression of ramA, acrB, rarA, and oqxB simultaneously, while 8 and 1 TNSKP strains had upregulation of ramA and acrB and of rarA and oqxB, respectively. Thus, resistance mechanisms of 9 TNSKP isolates cannot be explained by the present pathways. This study underscores the role of RamA in TNSKP and suggests the presence of novel tigecycline resistance mechanisms.
