In vitro activity of interferon-alpha-2b in combination with various antioxidants against the influenza virus and Herpes simplex was studied. The standard strains and a clinical strain of Herpes simplex isolated from a patient with resistance to acyclovir were used. The in vitro studie showed that antioxidants, such as alpho-tocoferol acetate (vitamin E), Unithiol and ascorbic acid had a significant antiinfluenzae and antiherpetic action on the influenza virus A/H5N1 and Herpes simplex variants. They protected up to 100% of the cell monolayer from the virus cytopathic effect. The taurin solutions had no antiviral activity irrespective of the infection dose. Combinations of interferon-alpha-2b with alpha-tocopherol acetate (vitamin E), Unithiol or ascorbic acid showed a significant synergistic effect: the antiviral activity of interferon increased several times. The antiinfluenza activity of interferon-a-2b in the presence of various concentrations of taurin did not change.
