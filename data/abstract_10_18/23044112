In this study, we present facile antimicrobial finishing of cotton textiles. Screen printing was used for surface-finishing of cotton using a printing paste containing silver nitrate. UVC irradiation was applied to convert silver nitrate into a color product, thus also changing the color of the textiles. The color, its strength and stability of samples, depend on absorbed UVC energy and the formula of the printing paste. Scanning electron microscopy with the energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry revealed formation of silver particles on cotton threads; X-ray diffraction analysis and the time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry did not provide clear information on these products. Microbiological studies revealed that the samples inhibited proliferation of Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. Washing fastness tests confirmed resistance of the samples to at least 50 washings. Additionally, the inhibition zones increased as the number of washing cycles increased, which is unique for such samples. This work also presents an approach to the design of antimicrobially finished workwear.
