In Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the mosaic type of penA, which encodes penicillin-binding protein 2 (PBP 2), is associated with reduced susceptibility to oral cephalosporins. To investigate the relatedness of N. gonorrhoeae clinical isolates with reduced susceptibility, we sequenced the penA genes of 32 isolates. Five different amino acid sequence types of PBP 2 were identified, but all seemed to be derivatives of pattern X of PBP 2 (PBP 2-X). However, multilocus sequence typing of the isolates showed that the isolates belonged to six different sequence types. As PBP 2-X was identified in three different sequence types, horizontal transfer of the penA allele encoding PBP2-X was suggested. We demonstrated that the penA gene could be transferred from an isolate with reduced susceptibility to a sensitive isolate by natural transformation. Comparison of the sequence of the penA-flanking regions of 12 transformants with those of the donor and the recipient suggested that at least a 4-kb DNA segment, including the penA gene, was transferred. During horizontal transfer, some of the penA alleles also acquired variations due to point mutations and genetic exchange within the allele. Our results provide evidence that the capacity for natural transformation in N. gonorrhoeae plays a role in the spread of chromosomal antibiotic resistance genes and the generation of diversity in such genes.
