Clostridium difficile is considered to be one of the most important causes of health care-associated infections currently. The prevalence and severity of C. difficile infection have increased significantly worldwide in the past decade which has led to the increased research interest. Here, using comparative genomics strategy coupled with bioinformatics tools we have identified potential drug targets in C. difficile and determined their three-dimensional structures in order to develop a database, named Clostridium-DT(DB). Currently, the database comprises the potential drug targets with their structural information from three strains of C. difficile, namely hypervirulent PCR-ribotype 027 strain R20291, PCR-ribotype 012 strain 630, and PCR-ribotype 027 strain CD196.
