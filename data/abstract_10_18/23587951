beta-Lactamase inhibitory protein II (BLIP-II) is a potent inhibitor of class A beta-lactamases. KPC-2 is a class A beta-lactamase that is capable of hydrolyzing carbapenems and has become a widespread source of resistance to these drugs for Gram-negative bacteria. Determination of association and dissociation rate constants for binding between BLIP-II and KPC-2 reveals a very tight interaction with a calculated (koff/kon) equilibrium dissociation constant of 76 fM (76 x 10(-15) M).
