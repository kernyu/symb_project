A transformation method yielding up to 10(4) transformants per mug circular DNA was developed for Thermoplasma acidophilum. The method is based on a natural DNA uptake process in which T. acidophilum cells keep their integrity and turn competent at pH 3.5 and 58 degrees C. Shuttle vector maintenance could not be detected, since the used Nov(R) gyraseB gene integrated into its chromosomal counterpart by homologous recombination.
