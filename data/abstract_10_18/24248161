BACKGROUND: Coagulase-negative staphylococci have emerged as responsible for a large number of infections. However, it is often difficult to assess its pathogenic role or to discard it as a contaminant. AIM: The goal of this study was to identify clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci to the species level and their virulence factors. Isolates came from patients consulting at the San Roque Laboratory from 2009 to 2011. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Species identification was performed by De Paulis et al simplified method. Production of biofilm, hemolysins, lipases, lecithinases and DNase were determined by conventional methods; methicillin-resistance by diffusion method and mecA and Panton-Valentine genes, by multiplex PCR. RESULTS: Out of 64 isolates, 40.6% were S. epidermidis; 20.3%, S. haemolyticus, and 15.6%, S. lugdunensis. Biofilm production was detected in 73.1% of S. epidermidis, 53.8% of S. haemolyticus and 40% of S. lugdunensis. mecA gene was identified in 69.2% of S. epidermidis, 92.3% of S. haemolyticus and none of S. lugdunensis. 83% of mecA (+) S. epidermidis isolates were biofilm producers as compared to 50% of the mecA (-). CONCLUSION: The frequency of S. lugdunensis, the most virulent coagulase-negative staphylococci species, was relatively high. The main virulence factor in S. epidermidis was biofilm production, being higher in those resistant to methicillin.
