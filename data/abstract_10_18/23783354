In this study, the effects of oral administration of different levels of Dunaliella salina (a natural beta-carotene source) on growth parameters, immunological and hematological indices, as well as skin carotenoids, of Heros severus were investigated. One hundred and eighty H. severus weighing 27 +/- 0.5 g were divided randomly into four groups in triplicate (15 fish in each replicate). Groups 1-4 received food supplemented with 0, 50, 100 and 200 mg kg(-)(1) D. salina powder, respectively. After 6 weeks, the growth parameters were compared among the groups. Blood samples were taken from each group, and hematological parameters including red blood cell count (RBC), white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (PCV), hemoglobin (Hb) and immunological indices (serum and mucus lysozyme and bactericidal activity, resistance against Aeromonas hydrophila infection) as well as carotenoid content of skin were evaluated. Results showed that some growth indices increased significantly in fish fed with 100 and 200 mg kg(-)(1) D. salina-supplemented food (P < 0.05). Although serum lysozyme activity was increased in fish fed with food supplemented with 100 and 200 mg kg(-)(1) D. salina (P < 0.05), no significant change was observed in serum and mucus bactericidal activity and mucus lysozyme activity among the groups (P > 0.05). Most of the hematological parameters such as WBC, RBC, PCV and Hb significantly increased in D. salina-treated fish compared with controls (P < 0.05). Mortality induced after challenge with A. hydrophila in 200 mg kg(-)(1) D. salina-treated fish was 36.67 %, which significantly decreased compared with control (P < 0.05). Skin carotenoid content in all D. salina treatments was statistically higher than that of control (P < 0.05). Conclusively, D. salina as a food additive can affect positively the growth, immunological and hematological parameters of H. severus.
