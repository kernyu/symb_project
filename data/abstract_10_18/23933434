Here we describe a study examining the antibiotic resistance gene carriage in anaerobes collected during a clinical study. The results demonstrated that genes normally associated with anaerobes were most prevalent such as tetQ, cepA and cblA although several genes associated with Enterobacteriaceae including sul2, blaSHV and strB were also detected.
