Comparison of the levels of the protein carboxylic groups in response to peroxide stress revealed enhanced stress resistance in Purpureocillium lilacinum strains isolated from soils with high content of copper or radionuclides compared to the strains isolated from uncontaminated soils. While in background strains resistance to peroxide stress increased with glucose content in the medium increasing from 0.002 to 2%, the strains from radionuclides- or copper-contaminated soils did not exhibit this pattern. Respiratory activity and polyphosphate content were compared for radiation-resistant strain 1941 and strain SM from the area with zero radioactivity. For the protoplasts of strain 1941 isolated from the Chernobyl zone, elevated respiratory activity was revealed on the media with low glucose content. Under the control conditions, the content of inorganic polyphosphates (polyP) in strains 1941 and SM was the same. Under conditions of peroxide stress, only the background strain SM grown on the medium with low glucose concentration exhibited decreased levels of inorganic polyphosphates. Independent on glucose concentration in the medium, in both P. lilacinum strains, polyP content increased in the course of regeneration after peroxide stress.
