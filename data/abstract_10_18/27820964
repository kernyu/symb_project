INTRODUCTION: Bronchiectasis is defined pathologically by the permanent dilation of the bronchi and bronchioles and chronic airway inflammation. This is the outcome of a number of different aetiologies but up to half of bronchiectasis cases are labelled idiopathic. It is characterised by a chronic productive cough, haemoptysis, shortness of breath and recurrent infective exacerbations. Long-term antibiotics are used with the aim of reducing symptom severity and exacerbation frequency, improving quality of life and preventing disease progression. Areas covered: This perspective provides an overview of evidence and current practice for long-term oral, inhaled and pulsed intravenous antibiotic therapy in adults with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. Evidence was drawn from a recent systemic literature review. Expert commentary: An approach to long-term antibiotic treatment is provided. Side effects of treatment, methods of monitoring treatment success and actions to be considered if treatment fails are discussed. Emerging long-term antibiotic treatments and strategies are considered.
