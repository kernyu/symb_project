OBJECTIVE: To establish a peptide nucleic acid clamping PCR assay for detecting hepatitis B virus (HBV) drug resistance mutation. METHODS: RtM204I (ATT) mutant, rtM204V (GTG) mutant and rtM204 (ATG) wild-type plasmids mixed at different ratios were detected for mutations by PNA clamping PCR assay and direct sequencing, and the sensitivity and specificity of the two methods were compared. Serum samples from 85 patients with chronic HBV infection were detected for drug resistance using the two methods. RESULTS: The sensitivity of PNA-PCR assay was 0.001% in a 10(5)-fold excess of wild-type HBV DNA with a detection limit of 10(1) copies. The sensitivity of direct sequencing was 10% with a detection limit of 10(4) copies. Mutants were detected in 73 of the 85 serum samples (85.9%), including YIDD in 40 samples, YVDD in 23 samples, and YIDD+YVDD in 10 samples. The agreement of PNA-PCR assay with direct sequencing was only 40% (34/85, YIDD in 21 samples, YVDD in 11 samples, and YIDD+YVDD in 2 samples). Neither of the two methods yielded positive results for the negative control samples, suggesting their good specificity. CONCLUSION: PNA-PCR assay appears to be a more sensitive and rapid assay for detection of HBV genotypic resistance.
