Biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance are important determinants for bacterial pathogenicity. Ribonucleases control RNA degradation and there is increasing evidence that they have an important role in virulence mechanisms. In this report, we show that ribonucleases affect susceptibility against ribosome-targeting antibiotics and biofilm formation in Salmonella.
