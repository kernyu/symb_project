OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology, chemistry, in vitro susceptibility, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, safety, tolerability, dosage, and administration of isavuconazole, a triazole antifungal agent. DATA SOURCES: Studies and reviews were identified through an English language MEDLINE search (1978 to March 2015) and from http://www.clinicaltrials.gov, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) briefing documents, program abstracts from international symposia, and the manufacturer's Web site. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All published and unpublished trials, abstracts, in vitro and preclinical studies, and FDA briefing documents were reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: Isavuconazole has activity against a number of clinically important yeasts and molds, including Candida spp, Aspergillus spp, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Trichosporon spp and variable activity against the Mucorales. Isavuconazole, available for both oral and intravenous administration, is characterized by slow elimination allowing once-daily dosing, extensive tissue distribution, and high (>99%) protein binding. The most commonly reported adverse events, which are mild and limited in nature, include nausea, diarrhea, and elevated liver function tests. Its drug interaction potential appears to be similar to other azole antifungals but less than those observed with voriconazole. Comparative trials are under way or have been recently completed for the treatment of candidemia, invasive candidiasis and aspergillosis, and rare mold infections. CONCLUSIONS: Isavuconazole has a broad spectrum of activity and favorable pharmacokinetic properties, providing an advantage over other currently available broad-spectrum azole antifungals and a clinically useful alternative to voriconazole for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis. It may also prove useful for the treatment of candidemia and invasive mold infections; however, these indications await the results of clinical trials.
