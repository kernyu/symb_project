Splenectomized mice control Listeria monocytogenes infection better than non-splenectomized mice. Here, BALB/c mice subjected to splenectomy and autogenous grafting of spleen were evaluated after 3 and 7 days of intravenous L. monocytogenes infection. The group of splenectomized animals (SP) presented a lower number of bacteria in the liver in comparison with both the sham-operated control group (CT) and the group that received splenic autotransplantation (AT) in the retroperitoneal site. The AT group presented bacterial counts in the liver similar to the CT group. SP animals showed larger production of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and nitric oxide (NO) in the liver in comparison with CT and AT, this being associated with greater accumulation of mononuclear cells. IFN-gamma production by spleen cells after stimulation with heat-killed Listeria was similar between the AT and CT groups, suggesting that the implanted fragments behaved like the original organ. The autogenous grafting of spleen fragments reverses the resistance to L. monocytogenes infection found in splenectomized mice, associated with a reduced IFN-gamma and NO production in the liver. The present study shows that splenic autotransplantation restores the function of the spleen in splenectomized mice, even though in this case it does favor the susceptibility to L. monocytogenes infection.
