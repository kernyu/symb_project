BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter is a growing concern and has been identified as a serious threat by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, there is little information on MDR Acinetobacter in individuals with spinal cord injuries and disorders (SCI/Ds). Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify risk factors for, and assess outcomes of, MDR Acinetobacter in veterans with SCI/Ds. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study from January 1, 2012-December 31, 2013, using national Veterans Affairs medical encounter and microbiology data. RESULTS: A total of 773 Acinetobacter cultures were identified in 571 patients, of which 58.9% were MDR. Inpatient culture, sputum and other specimen type, receipt of antibiotics within 90 days before culture date, and pressure ulcers were identified as independent predictors of MDR Acinetobacter. Highest odds of MDR Acinetobacter were seen with previous antibiotic use (odds ratio, 7.27; 95% confidence interval, 2.59-20.54). Thirty-day mortality was 5.3% in this study. Multidrug resistance, previous mechanical ventilation 90 days before the culture, and cancer were all independent risk factors for 30-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: There should be increased efforts to highlight the importance of antimicrobial stewardship to improve infection control to help limit spread of Acinetobacter in health care settings.
