The incidence of infections due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli has been increased dramatically in recent years. Treatment is difficult because of frequent multidrug resistance. To identify the sensitivity of commonly used antibiotics, 36 ESBL producing E. coli strains were isolated from young adult female patients in a govt. medical college hospital in Bangladesh. The samples were studied for antimicrobial sensitivity against nine (9) commonly used antibiotics namely ampicillin (amp), trimethoprim-sulfomethoxazole (tms), tetracycline (tet), ciprofloxacin (cip), mecillinum (mel), ceftriaxone (cef), nalidixic acid (nal), Azithromycin (azm) and Chloramphenicol (chl) and the MIC values were determined by agar dilution method. Overall, 72% of the strains were multidrug resistant (MDR) i.e. resistant to two or more drugs. Among 36 strains, 14 isolates were initially found to be resistant against third generation cephalosporin, ceftriaxone. Those were subjected to the test for production of ESBL (Extended Spectrum beta-Lactamase) and 7 showed positive results.
