Scientific community has made a lot of efforts to combat the infectious diseases using antimicrobial agents, but these are associated with problems of development of multi-drug resistance and their adverse side effects. To tackle these challenges, nanocarrier-based drug delivery system using polysaccharides has received enormous attention in the past few years. These antimicrobial agents can become more efficacious when adsorbed, entrapped, or linked to polysaccharides. In addition, these nanocarrier-based systems provide an increase in the surface area of the drug and are able to achieve the targeted drug delivery as well as used for the synthesis of packaging materials with improved mechanical strength, barrier, and antimicrobial properties. This review focuses on potential therapeutic applications of nanocarrier-based drug delivery systems using polysaccharides for antimicrobial applications.
