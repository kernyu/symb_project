We describe for the first time the emergence of an mecA-negative Staphylococcus lugdunensis strain with a modified PBP1A/1B that expresses resistance to all beta-lactams. A duplication of the tetrapeptide S(569)AYG, which is part of the transpeptidase domain of PBP1A/1B and closely located to the K(583)TG catalytic motif, was associated with this unusual phenotype.
