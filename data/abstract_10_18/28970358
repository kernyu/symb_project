Poor antiretroviral drug (ARV) penetration in the testes could be due, in part, to the presence of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) membrane-associated drug efflux transporters such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs) expressed at the blood-testis barrier (BTB). The functional expression of these transporters is known to be regulated by ligand-activated nuclear receptors pregnane X receptor (PXR) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) in various tissues. This study aimed to investigate in vitro and ex vivo the role of PXR and CAR in the regulation of ABC transporters at the BTB. Both PXR and CAR proteins were expressed in human testicular tissue and in mouse TM4 Sertoli cells (an in vitro cell line model of the BTB). In addition, we demonstrated an upregulation of P-gp, Bcrp, and Mrp4 mRNA and protein expression, after exposure to PXR or CAR ligands in TM4 cells. Small interfering RNA downregulation of PXR or CAR attenuated the expression of these transporters, suggesting the direct involvement of these nuclear receptors in regulating P-gp, Bcrp, and Mrp4 in this system. In an ex vivo study using freshly isolated mouse seminiferous tubules, we found that exposure to PXR or CAR ligands, including ARVs, significantly increased P-gp expression and function. Together, our data suggest that ABC transporters could be regulated at the BTB during chronic treatment with ARVs that can serve as ligands for PXR and CAR, which could in turn further limit testicular ARV concentrations.
