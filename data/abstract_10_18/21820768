Several quinonoid and phenazine compounds were synthesized in moderate to high yields and showed activity against H(37)Rv, rifampicin and isoniazid-resistance strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The cytotoxity of the compounds were evaluated against human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and these substances emerge as promising antitubercular prototypes.
