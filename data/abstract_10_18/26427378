In recent years, antimicrobial resistance has become a major medical threat worldwide. Among these threats, the rapid increase in carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) is a particularly challenging global issue in the health care setting. In this study, a novel lytic A. baumannii phage, Betavarphi-R3177, infecting carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii strains was isolated from sewage samples at a hospital. The morphology of the phage as assessed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicated that it belongs to the family Siphoviridae within the order Caudovirales. It has a linear double-stranded DNA genome of 47,575 bp with a G+C content of 39.83%. Eighty open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted; however, only 14 ORFs were annotated as encoding functional proteins, while most of the ORFs encoded hypothetical proteins. Among the total ORFs of the phage genome, no toxin-related genes were detected. A bioinformatics analysis showed that the whole genome sequence of phage Betavarphi-R3177 exhibited 62% sequence similarity to that of Acinetobacter phage Betavarphi-B1252, but there was no homology seen with other phages. Physiological characteristics, such as one-step growth properties, pH and temperature stability, and host cell lysis activity showed this phage has high stability and lytic activity against host bacteria and therefore has potential applicability as an antibacterial agent to control pathogens in the hospital environment.
