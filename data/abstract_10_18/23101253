This review summarizes the data of Russian and foreign authors as well as the results of original studies on etiology pathogenesis, and differential treatment of ulcer disease (UD). The author's original concepts of UD pathogenesis and relations between man and Helicobacter pylori are discussed. The pathogenetic role of disturbances in the system of gastroduodental self-regulatory function and psychosomatic mechanisms as well as immune deficiency and impaired antioxidatve protection is considered. Peculiarities and results of UD eradication therapy intended to eliminate H. pylori infection are described. The importance of the choice of the UD treatment strategy on an individual basis is emphasized as opposed to the use of universal standards and therapeutic modalities influencing only local pathogenic factors, such as acidopeptic ones and H. pylori infection.
