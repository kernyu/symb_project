Benzimidazole (BZ) resistance in gastrointestinal nematodes has been associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at codons 200, 167 and 198 in the beta-tubulin isotype 1 gene and, recently, these SNPs have also been found in macrocyclic lactone (ML) resistant strains of Haemonchus contortus. On this basis, we have studied the same putative SNPs in Spanish Teladorsagia circumcincta field isolates by pyrosequencing. Single L3 (infective 3rd stage larvae) from five sheep flocks were tested after confirming their BZ susceptibility and degree of ivermectin (IVM) resistance. According to the Faecal Egg Count Reduction Test (FECRT) one flock was classified as IVM susceptible, another one was resistant, and the rest had a suspicion of resistance to IVM. DNA extraction was carried out on 598 single L3 and 56% of these were identified as T. circumcincta after the amplification of a species-specific ITS2 fragment. The number of L3 analyzed for the SNPs 198/200 was 255 and for the SNP 167 was 187. Results clearly indicate no resistance-associated SNPs were present at any codon, before or after treatment. Therefore, all T. cicumcincta L3 were designated as susceptible homozygous genotypes for all SNPs. The absence of the mutations in these populations would argue against resistance haplotypes being present in the parasite population prior to drug treatment, at least in Spanish T. circumcincta.
