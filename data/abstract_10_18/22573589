A voriconazole-resistant isolate of Aspergillus fumigatus was recovered from an immunocompetent patient receiving long-term antifungal therapy for cerebral aspergillosis. A G448S amino acid substitution in the azole target (Cyp51A) was identified as the cause of the resistance phenotype. This article describes the first isolation of a voriconazole-resistant A. fumigatus isolate from an immunocompetent patient in Spain.
