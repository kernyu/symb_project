Candida albicans is an important fungal pathogen with a diploid genome that can adapt to caspofungin, a major drug from the echinocandin class, by a reversible loss of one copy of chromosome 5 (Ch5). Here, we explore a hypothesis that more than one gene for negative regulation of echinocandin tolerance is carried on Ch5. We constructed C. albicans strains that each lacked one of the following Ch5 genes: CHT2 for chitinase, PGA4 for glucanosyltransferase, and CSU51, a putative transcription factor. We demonstrate that independent deletion of each of these genes increased tolerance for caspofungin and anidulafungin, another echinocandin. Our data indicate that Ch5 carries multiple genes for negative control of echinocandin tolerance, although the final number has yet to be established.
