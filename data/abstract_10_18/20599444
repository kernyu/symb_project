The suicide system TK/GCV is an enzyme/prodrug therapy that involves the transfer of the cDNA for the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene (TK) into tumor cells which then sensitizes the cells to the non-toxic antiviral drug ganciclovir. Although extensively characterized, the suicide system TK/GCV conceals the details of its mechanism of action. In order to shed some light on this issue, we conducted experiments designed to identify key features of sensitive cells, as compared to cells that displayed reduced sensitivity to TK/GCV. Cell lines displaying different degrees of sensitivity underwent apoptotic cell death upon treatment with TK/GCV. S-phase delay, however, was almost exclusively restricted to sensitive cells and was impaired in a model of treatment-induced resistance. In this model genes with differential expression associated to induced resistance were identified. Noteworthy, two cell cycle-related genes (CCNE1 and GADD45) were functionally validated as conditioners of cellular sensitivity to TK/GCV. The relevance of cell cycle control was further demonstrated by experiments showing the association of Chk1 activation with greater TK/GCV cytotoxicity. Combination treatment with Chk1 inhibitor UCN-01 induced, in sensitive cells, an antagonistic effect on TK/GCV cytotoxicity highlighting the relevance of Chk1's activity on TK/GCV mechanism of action. These results reveal the relevance of cell cycle control pathways in the cytotoxicity induced by the TK/GCV system identifying candidate genes as conditioners of TK/GCV sensitivity. Moreover it points out, for the first time at Chk1 activation as a key factor to mediate TK/GCV cytotoxicity.
