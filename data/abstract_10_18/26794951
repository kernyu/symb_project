Starch hybrid polyethylhexylacrylate (PEHA)/polyvinylalcohol (PVA) nanocomposite thin films are prepared by different composition of nano CaCO3 in aqueous medium. The chemical interaction of nano CaCO3 with PEHA in presence of starch and PVA is investigated by Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). X-ray diffraction (XRD) is used in order to study the change in crystallite size and d-spacing during the formation of nanocomposite thin film. The surface morphology of nanofilms is studied by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The topology and surface roughness of the films is noticed by atomic force microscope (AFM). The tensile strength, thermal stability and thermal conductivity of films are increased with increase in concentrations of CaCO3 nanopowder. The chemical resistance and biodegradable properties of the nanocomposite thin films are also investigated. The growth of bacteria and fungi in starch hybrid PEHA film is reduced substantially with imprint of nano CaCO3.
