BACKGROUND: Klebsiella spp. are among the bacteria most commonly isolated from patients with infections in ICUs. The source of these infections may be the microflora of the patient or the hospital environment. Increasingly, Klebsiella strains are also being isolated from epidemic outbreaks. This situation is largely the result of widespread, irrational antibiotic use, the virulence of the bacterial strains and their ability to survive in the hospital environment. The purpose of this dissertation was to estimate the prevalence of Klebsiella pneumoniae strains isolated from patients hospitalised in a single ICU. METHODS: Seventy-eight isolates of K. pneumoniae were studied. The identification and the susceptibility to selected antibiotics were tested by an automated system, VITEK2 Compact. For the analysed strains, the production of different beta-lactamases was noted. RESULTS: Production of ESBL was detected in 64.1% of the K. pneumoniae strains isolated from infections and 74.4% from rectal swabs. Most of the strains were susceptible to imipenem (97.7%) and meropenem (96.1%). Sixty-nine (57.0%) of the analysed strains were identified as multidrug resistant. CONCLUSION: Most of the analysed Klebsiella pneumoniae strains produced ESBL-beta-lactamases. The frequency of colonisation and infection with multidrug resistant strains of K. pneumoniae in patients hospitalised in the ICU is very high.
