Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus auerus (MRSA) strains are having a major impact worldwide, and due to their resistance to all beta-lactams, an urgent need for new drugs is emerging. In this regard, the shikimate pathway is considered to be one of the metabolic features of bacteria and is absent in humans. Therefore enzymes involved in this route, such as shikimate dehydrogenase (SDH), are considered excellent targets for discovery of novel antibacterial drugs. In this study, the SDH from MRSA (SaSDH) was characterized. The results showed that the enzyme is a monomer with a molecular weight of 29 kDa, an optimum temperature of 65 degrees C, and a maximal pH range of 9-11 for its activity. Kinetic studies revealed that SDH showed Michaelis-Menten kinetics toward both substrates (shikimate and NADP+). Initial velocity analysis suggested that SaSDH catalysis followed a sequential random mechanism. Additionally, a tridimensional model of SaSDH was obtained by homology modeling and validated. Through virtual screening three inhibitors of SaSDH were found (compounds 238, 766 and 894) and their inhibition constants and mechanism were obtained. Flexible docking studies revealed that these molecules make interactions with catalytic residues. The data of this study could serve as starting point in the search of new chemotherapeutic agents against MRSA.
