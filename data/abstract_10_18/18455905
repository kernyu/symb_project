Due to its broad spectrum of clinical presentations and to the large number of available serotonergic medications, serotonin syndrome (SS) remains an elusive diagnosis to many clinicians. SS results from the over-stimulation of serotonin receptors by a variety of mechanisms. New medications with the potential to cause SS are released regularly, and among them is the antibiotic linezolid. We present a case of SS in a 36-year-old woman that occurred after linezolid was added to a drug regimen that included lithium, venlafaxine, and imipramine.
