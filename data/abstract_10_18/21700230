Invasive fungal diseases (IFD) are important causes of solid organ transplant-related morbidity and mortality. Modifications and improvements in the transplant surgical procedures, supportive care, and advances in the diagnosis and treatment of these IFD have produced notable changes in their epidemiology and outcome. Candida and other yeast genera continue to play an important etiological role, but Aspergillus and other filamentous fungi are the cause of most IFD in lung transplant recipients. This review is an update of the relevant findings in the literature related to the epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of IFD in solid organ transplant recipients, with a main focus on invasive aspergillosis and candidiasis.
