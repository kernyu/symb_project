OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical distribution and antibiotics resistance of nosocomial infection caused pathogenic bacteria in patients after cardiac surgery. METHODS: Clinical data from 612 patients after cardiac surgery under microbiologically documented nosocomial infection was retrospectively analyzed from January 2007 to December 2012. Identification on related bacterial was performed in an automatic ATB Expression system while antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by Kirby-Bauer method. RESULTS: were analyzed by WHONET5.4. RESULTS: There were 697 strains of clinical pathogenic bacilli isolates identified and 421 (60.4%) of them were isolated from sputum while 185 (26.5%) were from blood. Acinetobacter spp. (124 strains, 17.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (85 strains, 12.2%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (50 strains, 7.2%) were the predominant Gram-negative bacilli while S. epidermidis (75 strains, 10.8%) was the predominant Gram-positive cocci. The predominant eumycete was Candida albicans (43 strains, 6.2%). RESULTS: from the susceptibility test showed that carbapenems, cefoperazone/sulbactam and piperacillin/tazobactam were the most active antibiotics. The detection of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus (MRS) were 82.9% in S aureus and 95.9% in coagulase negative Staphylococcus. There was no Staphylococcus strains resistant to vancomycin found. CONCLUSION: Non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli and Staphylococcus appeared the important pathogens in patients after cardiac surgery. Drug resistance to antibiotics was quite common. Prevention on nosocomial infection and rational use of antibiotics remained very important in reducing the amount of drug resistant strains.
