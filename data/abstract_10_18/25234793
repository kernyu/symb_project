Members of the Fusarium solani species complex (FSSC) are causing the majority of the fusariosis in humans. Disseminated fusariosis has a high mortality and is predominantly observed in patients with leukemia. Here, we present the case of a fatal infection by a Fusarium strain with a degenerated phenotype, in a patient with acute lymphatic leukemia. Multiple nasal and skin biopsies as well as blood cultures yielded fungal growth, while in direct and histopathological examination of biopsy material septate hyphae were visible. Initial colonies were white with slimy masses with microconidia reminiscent of Fusarium/Acremonium, but with conidiospore production directly on the hyphae. Multi-locus sequence typing discerned a pionnotal-morphologically degenerated-colony of the recently recognized F. petroliphilum as etiological agent. The culture returned to a typical F. solani species complex morphology only after several weeks of growth in culture. Antifungal susceptibility tests indicate amphotericin B as best drug for this FSSC member rather than any of the azoles or echinocandins.
