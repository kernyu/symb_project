Among 32 Trichosporon asahii isolates collected in four rounds of the Taiwan Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance of Yeasts (TSARY) studies, conducted in 1999, 2002, 2006, and 2010, five different intergenic spacer 1 (IGS1) genotypes were detected. Genotype 1 was the most common (43.8%), followed by genotypes 3 (28.1%), 7 (12.5%), 5 (9.4%), and 4 (6.3%). Interestingly, genotype 7 was more prevalent in Taiwan than in other areas (P = 0.01); while we did not find a significant association between IGS1 genotype and susceptibility to antifungal drugs, we did note that the majority of isolates of T. asahii were susceptible to both fluconazole and voriconazole, consistent with previous reports. A higher proportion of isolates (P = 0.05) collected in 2010 (4/12, 33.3%) had high amphotericin B MICs (>/= 2 mg/l) than those collected in the previous three TSARYs (1/21, 5%). Hence, the new data of genotypes and drug susceptibilities in the present study may contribute to the epidemiology of T. asahii.
