A boronic acid moiety was found to be a critical pharmacophore for enhanced in vitro potency against wild-type hepatitis C replicons and known clinical polymorphic and resistant HCV mutant replicons. The synthesis, optimization, and structure-activity relationships associated with inhibition of HCV replication in a subgenomic replication system for a series of non-nucleoside boron-containing HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5B) inhibitors are described. A summary of the discovery of 3 (GSK5852), a molecule which entered clinical trials in subjects infected with HCV in 2011, is included.
