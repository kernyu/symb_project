Many antimicrobial peptides from amphibian skin have been purified and structurally characterized and may be developed as therapeutic agents. Here we describe the antibacterial properties and membrane interaction of chensinin-1, a cationic arginine/histidine-rich antimicrobial peptide, from the skin secretions of Rana chensinensis. The amino acid composition, sequence, and atypical structure of chensinin-1 differ from other known antimicrobial peptides from amphibian skin. Chensinin-1 exhibited selective antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, was inactive against Gram-negative bacteria, and had no hemolytic activity on human erythrocytes. The CD spectra for chensinin-1 indicated that the peptide adopted an aperiodic structure in water and a conformational structure with 20 % beta-strands, 8 % alpha-helices, and the remaining majority of random coils in the trifluoroethanol or SDS solutions. Time-kill kinetics against Gram-positive Bacillus cereus demonstrated that chensinin-1 was rapidly bactericidal at 2x MIC and PAE was found to be >5 h. Chensinin-1 caused rapid and large dye leakage from negatively charged model vesicles. Furthermore, membrane permeation assays on intact B. cereus indicated that chensinin-1 induced membrane depolarization in less than 1 min and followed to damage the integrity of the cytoplasmic membrane and resulted in efflux of molecules from cytoplasma. Hence, the primary target of chensinin-1 action was the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria. Chensinin-1 was unable to overcome bacterial resistance imposed by the lipopolysaccharide leaflet, the major constituent of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Lipopolysaccharide induced oligomerization of chensinin-1, thus preventing its translocation across the outer membrane.
