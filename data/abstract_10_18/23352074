BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance of uropathogens in urinary tract infections (UTIs) is increasing worldwide. This study aimed to compare the spectrum and antimicrobial resistance of uropathogens in community-acquired UTIs (CAUTIs) and nosocomial-acquired UTIs (NAUTIs) at a tertiary hospital in China. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of uropathogens from UTI patients was performed at Zhong Da Hospital. RESULTS: A total of 1129 strains was isolated from 653 community-acquired and 476 nosocomial-acquired infections. Escherichia coli was the most common uropathogen, accounting for 55.9% of the CAUTIs and 27.1% of the NAUTIs. Among the CAUTIs, Escherichia coli was followed in prevalence by Enterococcus spp (12.9%) and Proteus mirabilis (3.7%). Among the NAUTIs, Escherichia coli was followed by Enterococcus spp (15.3%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.9%). The proportion of fungi in the NAUTIs (23.7%) was higher than that in the CAUTIs (3.1%) (P < .05). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains of E coli accounted for 70.6% of the NAUTIs and 47.3% of the CAUTIs. Carbapenems, amikacin, and nitrofurantoin were active agents against E coli. The resistance rates of E coli to cephalosporins, ampicillin, ampicillin/sulbactam, quinolones, and gentamicin were higher in the NAUTIs than in the CAUTIs (P < .05). CONCLUSION: The distribution of species was different between CAUTIs and NAUTIs. Higher antibiotic resistance rates were observed in the NAUTIs than in the CAUTIs.
