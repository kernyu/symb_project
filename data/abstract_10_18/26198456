Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 protease is one of the most promising drug target commonly utilized to combat Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). However, with the emergence of drug resistance arising from mutations, the efficiency of protease inhibitors (PIs) as a viable treatment for AIDS has been greatly reduced. I50V mutation as one of the most significant mutations occurring in HIV-1 protease will be investigated in this study. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was utilized to examine the effect of I50V mutation on the binding of two PIs namely indinavir and amprenavir to HIV-1 protease. Prior to the simulations conducted, the electron density distributions of the PI and each residue in HIV-1 protease are derived by combining quantum fragmentation approach molecular fractionation with conjugate caps and Poisson-Boltzmann solvation model based on polarized protein-specific charge scheme. The atomic charges of the binding complex are subsequently fitted using delta restrained electrostatic potential (delta-RESP) method to overcome the poor charge determination of buried atom. This way, both intraprotease polarization and the polarization between protease and the PI are incorporated into partial atomic charges. Through this study, the mutation-induced affinity variations were calculated and significant agreement between experiments and MD simulations conducted was observed for both HIV-1 protease-drug complexes. In addition, the mechanism governing the decrease in the binding affinity of PI in the presence of I50V mutation was also explored to provide insights pertaining to the design of the next generation of anti-HIV drugs.
