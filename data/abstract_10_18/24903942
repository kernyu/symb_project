OBJECTIVE: To describe tuberculosis (TB) incidence, risk factors, clinical presentation, disease management and outcomes in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients from the CoRIS cohort, Spain, 2004-2010. DESIGN: Open multicentre cohort of antiretroviral treatment (ART) naive patients at entry. Incidence and risk factors were evaluated using multivariate Poisson regression. RESULTS: Among 6811 patients, 271 were eligible for the study and 198 for the estimation of the incidence rate; TB incidence ranged from 12.1 to 14.1/1000 person-years. TB was associated with low education level (rate ratio [RR] 2.65, 95%CI 1.73-4.07), being sub-Saharan African (RR 3.14, 95%CI 1.81-5.45), heterosexual (RR 2.01, 95%CI 1.22-3.29) or an injecting drug user (RR 2.11, 95%CI 1.20-3.69), not undergoing ART (RR 3.33, 95%CI 2.22-4.76), CD4 <200 cells/mm(3) (RR 5.20, 95%CI 3.25-8.33) and log-viral load of 4-5 (RR 5.44, 95%CI 3.28-9.02) or >5 (RR 13.10, 95%CI 8.27-20.76). Overall, 87% were new cases and 13% were previously treated cases; 175 (65%) were bacteriologically confirmed. Drug susceptibility testing was performed in 146 (83%) patients: resistance to first-line drugs was 11.1% in new and 36.4% in previously treated cases. Standard anti-tuberculosis treatment with four or three drugs was prescribed in respectively 55% and 36% of cases. Treatment default was 11%, and was higher among previously treated cases; 80% received ART during anti-tuberculosis treatment, 80% of new and 50% of previously treated cases were cured or completed treatment, and 18 (6.6%) died. CONCLUSION: TB incidence in HIV-infected patients remains high. Interventions should include early HIV diagnosis and access to ART, enhanced bacteriological confirmation, wider use of four-drug regimens and reduction in treatment default.
