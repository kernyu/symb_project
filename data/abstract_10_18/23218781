A series of amine-alkyl derivatives of 5-arylidenehydantoin 3-21 was evaluated for their ability to improve antibiotic effectiveness in two strains of Gram-negative Enterobacter aerogenes: the reference strain (ATCC-13048) and the chloramphenicol-resistant derivative over-producing the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump (CM-64). Three antibiotics, chloramphenicol, nalidixic acid and sparfloxacin were used as markers of efflux pump activity. New compounds (5-16) were obtained within 3-4 step synthesis using Knoevenagel condensation, Mitsunobu reaction and microwave aided N-alkylation. Molecular modeling based structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies were performed. The most active compounds: (Z)-5-(4-(diethylamino)benzylidene)-3-(2-hydroxy-3-(4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazin-1 -yl)propyl)imidazolidine-2,4-dione (14) and (Z)-5-(2,4-dimethoxybenzylidene)-3-(2-hydroxy-3-(isopropylamino)propyl)imidazolid ine-2,4-dione (15) induced fourfold decrease of minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) of all tested antibiotics in the strain CM-64 overexpressing the AcrAB-TolC pump.
