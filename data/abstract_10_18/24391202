We evaluated detection of ertapenem (ETP) resistance and Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) in 47 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates using a novel automated microscopy system. Automated microscopy correctly classified 22/23 isolates as ETP resistant and 24/24 as ETP susceptible and correctly classified 21/21 isolates as KPC positive and 26/26 as KPC negative.
