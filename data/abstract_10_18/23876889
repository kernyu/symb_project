BACKGROUND: The catheter related infection caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm is increasing and difficult to treat by antimicrobial chemotherapy. The properties of biofilms that give rise to antibiotic resistance are only partially understood. This study aimed to elucidate the penetration of erythromycin through Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm. METHODS: The penetration ratio of erythromycin through Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms of 1457, 1457-msrA, and wild isolate S68 was detected by biofilm penetration model at different time points according to the standard regression curve. The RNA/DNA ratio and the cell density within the biofilms were observed by confocal laser microscope and transmission electromicroscope, respectively. RESULTS: The penetration ratios of erythromycin through the biofilms of 1457, 1457-msrA, and S68 after cultivation for 36 hours were 0.93, 0.55 and 0.4, respectively. The erythromycin penetration ratio through 1457 biofilm (0.58 after 8 hours) was higher than that through the other two (0.499 and 0.31 after 24 hours). Lower growth rate of the cells in biofilm was shown, with reduction of RNA/DNA proportion observed by confocal laser microscope through acridine orange stain. Compared with the control group observed by transmission electrmicroscope, the cell density of biofilm air face was lower than that of agar face, with more cell debris. CONCLUSIONS: Erythromycin could penetrate to the Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm, but could not kill the cells thoroughly. The lower growth rate of the cells within biofilm could help decreasing the erythromycin susceptibility.
