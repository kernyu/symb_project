The efficacy of antibiotics and host defenses has been linked to the metabolic and redox states of bacteria. In this study we report that a stress-induced export pump belonging to the major facilitator superfamily effluxes citrate and iron from the enteric pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium to arrest growth and ameliorate the effects of antibiotics, hydrogen peroxide, and nitric oxide. The transporter, formerly known as MdtD, is now designated IceT (iron citrate efflux transporter). Iron efflux via an iron-chelating tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate provides a direct link between aerobic metabolism and bacterial stress responses, representing a unique mechanism of resistance to host defenses and antimicrobial agents of diverse classes.
