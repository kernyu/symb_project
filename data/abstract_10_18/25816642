Species of the genus Acinetobacter represent opportunistic bacteria with a growing clinical significance. In this literature review, we focus on the current role of Acinetobacter in infectious pathology and describe physiology, taxonomy, ecology, pathogenicity, and antibiotic resistance of these bacteria. Molecular pathogenesis and regulation of virulence factors in Acinetobacter spp. are described in detail. The majority of acinetobacterial infections are associated with A. baumannii and occur predominantly in an immunocompromised host. Usually, acinetobacterial infections are characterized by local purulent inflammation; in severe cases, meningitis and sepsis may develop. Antibiotic resistance ofAcinetobacter is a major clinical problem; therefore we give special attention to laboratory testing of resistance as well as identification of Acinetobacter. In addition, treatment and prophylaxis of acinetobacterial infections are discussed.
