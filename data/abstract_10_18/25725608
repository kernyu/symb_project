We recently reported that potent N10,O11-bis-alkylamine indolo[3,2-b]quinoline antimalarials act as hemozoin (Hz) growth inhibitors. To improve access and binding to the target we have now designed novel N10,N11-di-alkylamine bioisosteres. 3-Chloro derivatives (10a-f) showed selectivity for malaria parasite compared to human cells, high activity against Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine (CQ)-resistant strain W2 (IC50s between 20 and 158nM), good correlation with beta-hematin inhibition and improved vacuolar accumulation ratios, thus suggesting inhibition of Hz growth as one possible mechanism of action for these compounds. Moreover, our studies show that Hz is a valid target for the development of new antimalarials able to overcome CQ resistance.
