BACKGROUND: Acinetobacter species are ubiquitous in the environment and are important causative agent for nososcomial infection especially in immunocompromised patients. Multi drug resistant Acinetobacter lwoffii are emerging as a pathogen in neoanatal sepsis. AIMS AND OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed to evaluate the clinical and antibiotic profile of Acinetobacter lwoffii. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was done on blood samples from neonates admitted to neonatal intensive care unit during a period of one year from January to December 2012, who developed Acinetobacter infection. The diagnosis of isolates and antibiotic susceptibility testing was done by both conventional as well as by automated system. RESULTS: Out of total 13,133 blood samples received for culture, 1418(10.8%) were from NICU. Ninety (6.3%) isolates were found to be positive for the growth of Acinetobacter species. Of these isolates 31.11% were found to be Acinetobacter lwoffii, 68.9% were Acinetobacter baumannii calcaetius complex. Acinetobacter lwoffii isolates were most commonly sensitive to imepenem 16(57%), cotrimoxazole 9(32%), ciprofloxacin 6(21%) followed by amoxyclavulanic acid 2(7%) and cefuroxime 1(3.5%). CONCLUSION: Multi drug resistant Acinetobacter lwoffii infection is increasing particularly in premature and very low-birth weight neonates. Judicious and timely antibiotic use in NICUs are one of the important key in controlling multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter infection and improving clinical outcome.
