BACKGROUND: Linezolid-nonsusceptible enterococci (LNSE) is an increasingly emerging multidrug-resistant pathogen, and the caused nosocomial infections are difficult to manage. However, data on the host-related risk factors and clinical outcomes for LNSE infection are poorly characterized. METHODS: A retrospective case-case-control study of risk factors and clinical outcomes of hospitalized patients with LNSE infection during the period 2011-2014 was conducted in a teaching hospital in Chongqing, China. Case patients with LNSE and those with linezolid-susceptible enterococci (LSE) and controls with no enterococcal infection were compared at a ratio of 1:1:4. Two parallel multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate independent predictors for acquiring LNSE and LSE, respectively. RESULTS: Forty-four LNSE cases, 44 LSE cases, and 176 uninfected controls were analyzed. Multivariable analysis indicated that transferring from another hospital (odds ratio [OR], 3.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.58-8.09), peripheral vascular disease (OR, 4.36; 95% CI, 1.64-11.60), and exposure to cephalosporins (OR, 4.24; 95% CI, 1.85-9.71) were unique independent predictors for acquiring LNSE. Gallbladder disease (OR, 3.64; 95% CI, 1.36-9.74) was independently associated with LSE acquisition. Polymicrobial infection was the only factor identified in both LNSE and LSE groups compared with controls; however, no statistical significance was observed in in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: Timely control efforts and appropriate antibiotic stewardship programs are necessary to effectively reduce the burden of LNSE infections among high-risk patients.
