The Australian Group on Antimicrobial Resistance performs regular period-prevalence studies to monitor changes in antimicrobial resistance in selected enteric Gram-negative pathogens. The 2012 survey focussed on community-onset infections, examining isolates from urinary tract infections from patients presenting to outpatient clinics, emergency departments or to community practitioners. In 2012, 2,025 Escherichia coli, 538 Klebsiella species and 239 Enterobacter species were tested using a commercial automated method (Vitek 2, BioMerieux) and results were analysed using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoints from January 2012. Of the key resistances, non-susceptibility to the third-generation cephalosporin, ceftriaxone, was found in 4.2% of E. coli and 4.6%-6.9% of Klebsiella spp. Non-susceptibility rates to ciprofloxacin were 6.9% for E. coli, 0.0%-3.5% for Klebsiella spp. and 0.8%-1.9% in Enterobacter spp, and resistance rates to piperacillin-tazobactam were 1.7%, 0.7%-9.2%, and 8.8%-11.4% for the same 3 groups respectively. Only 1 Enterobacter cloacae was shown to harbour a carbapenemase (IMP-4).
