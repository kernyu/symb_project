Growing resistance to antibiotics, as well as newly emerging pathogens, stimulate the investigation of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as therapeutic agents. Here, we report a new library design concept based on a stochastic distribution of natural AMP amino acid sequences onto half-length synthetic peptides. For these compounds, a non-natural motif of alternating D- and L-backbone stereochemistry of the peptide chain predisposed for beta-helix formation was explored. Synthetic D-/L-peptides with permuted half-length sequences were delineated from a full-length starter sequence and covalently recombined to create two-dimensional compound arrays for antibacterial screening. Using the natural AMP magainin as a seed sequence, we identified and iteratively optimized hit compounds showing high antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with low hemolytic activity. Cryo-electron microscopy characterized the membrane-associated mechanism of action of the new D-/L-peptide antibiotics.
