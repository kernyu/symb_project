A retrospective analysis of 86 HIV-1 vertically-infected Vietnamese children with a follow-up period >24 months after initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) was performed from 2008 to 2012, to assess the outcome of first-line ART in resource-limited settings. Of the 86 children, 68 (79.1%) were treated successfully (plasma HIV-1 viral load [VL] <1000 copies/ml), and 63 (73.3%) had full viral suppression (VL <400 copies/ml) after 24 months of ART. No significant difference between successfully treated patients and failure groups was observed in VL, CD4(+) T-cell count or clinical stage at baseline; age at ART start; or ART regimen. All 14 children with VL >5000 copies/ml, one of four children with VL 1000-5000 copies/ml and none with VL <1000 copies/ml developed reverse transcriptase inhibitor (RTI)-resistance mutations by 24 months of ART. Y181C and M184V/I were the most dominant non-nucleoside and nucleoside RTI-resistance mutations, respectively (13/15, 86.7%). These findings suggest that VL testing after 24 months of ART can be used to efficiently differentiate ART failures among HIV-1 vertically-infected children in resource-limited settings.
