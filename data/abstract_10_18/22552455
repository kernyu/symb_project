OBJECTIVES: Drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes much higher rates of treatment toxicity, failure or relapse, and mortality. We determined the drug resistant profile of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains isolated from a population of HIV-infected patients in southern Brazil and studied the potential factors associated with resistance. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study to determine the resistance profile of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from HIV-infected patients and factors that could be associated with resistance from 2000 to 2005. RESULTS: 236 patients were included in the study. Resistance to at least one drug was observed in 32 (14.6%) isolates, and multi-drug resistance was observed in 4 (1.82%) isolates. On multivariate analysis, previous use of tuberculostatics and quinolones were related to any first-line drug resistance. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, previous quinolone use was significantly associated to first-line anti-TB drugs resistance. Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a major problem worldwide, and we believe quinolones should be used with caution in settings where TB is endemic.
