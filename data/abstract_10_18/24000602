Various macroorganism factors influence spontaneous and therapy induced elimination of hepatitis C virus. Standard therapy is application of a combination of pegylated interfernos and ribavirin. However such tactics results in attainment of a resistant virological response in approximately half the cases during infection by genotype 1 virus. The future of viral hepatitis C therapy lies most probably in the sphere of application of specific antiviral preparations such as protease and/or polymerase inhibitors as an addition to standard therapy. The aim of this review was to describe mechanisms of resistance to therapy in light of reaction of innate and adaptive immune response as well as an attempt to determine factors capable of prognosing response to therapy
