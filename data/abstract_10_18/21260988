Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is recommended by WHO experts as a drug to treat and prevent of influenza and to create stocks if its new pandemic variant occurs. The susceptibility of influenza viruses to oseltamivir was studied by polymerase chain reaction-based techniques detecting specific mutations in the neuraminidase gene. The increase in the number of oseltamivir-resistant influenza viruses, isolated from the Russian Federation, with type 1 neuraminidase H274Y mutation from 49% (2007-20008) to 92% (2008-2009) did not depend on the frequency of oseltamivir use. Full correlation of the results obtained by various techniques allows them to be used to monitor the susceptibility of influenza viruses to oseltamivir.
