Telavancin is a lipoglycopeptide with potent activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA). The activity of telavancin against MRSA and MSSA after prior vancomycin exposure was studied in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model. Two clinical MRSA and two MSSA isolates, all with vancomycin MICs of 2 mug/ml, were subjected to humanized free drug exposures of vancomycin at 1 g every 12 h (q12h) for 96 h, telavancin at 750 mg q24h for 96 h, and vancomycin at 1 g q12h for 72 h followed by telavancin at 750 mg q24h for 48 h (120 h total). The microbiological responses were measured by changes from 0 h in log10 CFU/ml at the end of experiments and area under the bacterial killing and regrowth curves over 96 h (AUBC0-96). The control isolates grew to 8.8 +/- 0.3 log10 CFU/ml. Initially, all regimens caused -4.5 +/- 0.9 reductions in log10 CFU/ml by 48 h followed by slight regrowth over the following 48 to 72 h. After 96 h, vancomycin and telavancin achieved -3.7 +/- 0.9 and -3.8 +/- 0.8 log10 CFU/ml changes from baseline, respectively (P = 0.74). Sequential exposure to telavancin after vancomycin did not result in additional CFU reductions or increases, with ultimate log10 CFU/ml reductions of -4.3 +/- 1.1 at 96 h and -4.2 +/- 1.3 at 120 h (P > 0.05 for all comparisons at 96 h). The AUBC0-96 was significantly smaller for the regimen of telavancin for 96 h than for the regimens of vancomycin for 96 h and vancomycin followed by telavancin (P </= 0.04). No resistance was observed throughout the experiment. Against these MRSA and MSSA isolates with vancomycin MICs of 2 mug/ml, telavancin was comparable with vancomycin and its activity was unaffected by prior vancomycin exposure.
