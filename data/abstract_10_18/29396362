Aminothiazolyl berberine derivatives as potentially antimicrobial agents were designed and synthesized in an effort to overcome drug resistance. The antimicrobial assay revealed that some target compounds exhibited significantly inhibitory efficiencies toward bacteria and fungi including drug-resistant pathogens, and the aminothiazole and Schiff base moieties were helpful structural fragments for aqueous solubility and antibacterial activity. Especially, aminothiazolyl 9-hexyl berberine 9c and 2,4-dichlorobenzyl derivative 18a exhibited good activities (MIC=2nmol/mL) against clinically drug-resistant Gram-negative Acinetobacter baumanii with low cytotoxicity to hepatocyte LO2 cells, rapidly bactericidal effects and quite slow development of bacterial resistance toward A. baumanii. Molecular modeling indicated that compounds 9c and 18a could bind with GLY-102, ARG-136 and/or ALA-100 residues of DNA gyrase through hydrogen bonds. It was found that compounds 9c and 18a were able to disturb the drug-resistant A. baumanii membrane effectively, and molecule 9c could not only intercalate but also cleave bacterial DNA isolated from resistant A. baumanii, which might be the preliminary antibacterial action mechanism of inhibiting the growth of A. baumanii strain. In particular, the combination use of compound 9c with norfloxacin could enhance the antibacterial activity, broaden antibacterial spectrum and overcome the drug resistance.
