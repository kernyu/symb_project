Using the model of hypogonadism in C57Bl/6 male mice, we showed that injection of streptozotocin to newborn animals and high-fat diet induced serum IFN-gamma and IL-17 elevation, glucose metabolism disturbances, insulin resistance, destructive changes of the Langerhans islets (deficit of PDX1(+)beta cells), while the number of oligopotent beta cell precursors (CD45(-)TER119(-)CD133(+)CD49f(low)) increased. Diabetes played the role of an inducer of testicular tissue inflammation (pan-hemopoietic cell infiltration, increase of IL-2, IL-17, and IL-23 content) and reproductive system disturbances in mice (decrease in free testosterone concentration, suppression of spermatogenesis, and infertility). The development of hypogonadism was paralleled by an increase in the count of spermatogonial stem cells (CD117(+)CD29(+)CD90(+)), multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (CD45(-)CD31(-)CD90(+)CD106(+)), hemangiogenesis precursors (CD45(-)CD117(+)Flk1(+)), and epithelial cells (CD45(-)CD31(-)CD49f(+)CD326(+)).
