Antibiotic-resistant opportunistic pathogens have become a serious concern in recent decades, as they are increasingly responsible for hospital-acquired infections. Here, we describe quinolone-resistant Delftia sp. strain 670, isolated from the sputum of a patient who died from severe pulmonary infection. The draft genome sequence of this strain was obtained by whole-genome shotgun sequencing, and was subjected to comparative genome analysis. Genome analysis revealed that one critical mutation (Ser83Ile in gyrA) might play a decisive role in quinolone resistance. The genome of Delftia sp. strain 670 contains both type II and type VI secretion systems, which were predicted to contribute to the virulence of the strain. Phylogenetic analysis, assimilation tests, and comparative genome analysis indicated that strain 670 differed from the four known Delftia species, suggesting this strain could represent a novel species. Although the study could not determine the strain 670 as the pathogen led to mortality, our findings also presented the pathogenic potential of Delftia species, and the increasing severity of antibiotic resistance among emerging opportunistic pathogens. The whole genome sequencing and comparative analysis improved our understanding of genome evolution in the genus Delftia, and provides the foundation for further study on drug resistance and virulence of Delftia strains.
