Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is highly associated with the occurrence of gastrointestinal diseases, including gastric inflammation, peptic ulcer, gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid-tissue lymphoma and gastric cancer. It is a key strategy to prevent and treat these diseases by eradicating H. pylori. Due to the increasing rates of antimicrobial resistance of clarithromycin and metronidazole, the eradication rate of standard triple therapy is less than 80% in recent years. On the basis of traditional triple therapy, combination with some treatments, such as probiotics, mucoprotective agents, Chinese medicine and oral clean, can improve the H. pylori eradication rate.
