In the face of increasing resistance to the existing antibiotics, oxazolidinones (exemplified by linezolid) have been developed as promising antibacterial agents, but may have other useful actions. In the present study, a series of 5(1H1,2,3triazoly) lmethyl, 5acetamidomethylmorpholino and Nsubstitutedpiperazino oxazolidinone derivatives were investigated to determine whether they are active against eukaryotic cells. An MTT assay, validated by cell counting, was used to assess the effect of nine oxazolidinone derivatives (concentrations 100 nM10 microM) on the proliferation of MCF7 human breast cancer cells. The three most active compounds were then tested on MDA231 breast cancer cells. Cytotoxicity of the selected derivatives was determined by assessing the extent of apoptosis by flow cytometry. The antimetastatic potential of these compounds was assessed on MDA231 cells using wound healing and agarose invasion assays. The 5triazolylmethyl piperazinooxazolidinone derivatives containing 4N(2chlorocinnamoyl), 4N(4nitrobenzoyl) and 4Nmethylsulfonyl moieties exhibited the most potent cytostatic activity against cancer, inhibiting proliferation by up to 70%, in the same order as their reported antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, but at higher concentrations. Unexpectedly, several derivatives stimulated proliferation at 100 nM, well below their antibacterial minimum inhibitory concentrations. Certain compounds also retarded the motility and invasion of MDA231 cells. Three of the tested derivatives had no effect on the eukaryotic cell lines, demonstrating their preferential activity against bacteria. Two compounds actually stimulated eukaryotic cell proliferation. The remaining three exhibited potent cytostatic activity against and cancer cells, displaying differences in response at low and high concentrations, which may suggest multiple targets on eukaryotic cells. These latter compounds may be useful as anticancer agents.
