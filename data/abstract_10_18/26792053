OBJECTIVE: To investigate the drug-resistance rate of community-acquired respiratory tract pathogens isolated from class B hospitals in China during 2013 and 2014. METHODS: A total of 860 strains (S.pneumoniae 299, K. pneumoniae 221, H. influenzae 185, S. aureus 116, and M. catarrhalis 39) of non-duplicated community-acquired respiratory tract pathogens were isolated from 10 class B hospitals in 9 cities. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antibacterial agents was determined by the broth microdilution method. The sensitive rates and MIC range of the antibiotics were analyzed by the WHONET-5.6 software. RESULTS: Only 19.7%(59/299) S. pneumoniae was sensitive to oral penicillin. The sensitive rates of S. pneumoniae to second-generation cephalosporins(cefuroxime and cefaclor), amoxicillin with clavulanic acid, ceftriaxone, and macrolides (erythromycin, azithromycin and clarithromycin) were 25.6% (77/299), 33.4% (100/299), 63.5% (190/299), and 4.4% (13/299), respectively. About 93.5% (280/299)and 98.0% (293/299)of S. pneumoniae isolates were sensitive to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin.All of the K. pneumoniae isolates were sensitive to ertapenem and imipenem. The sensitive rates of K. pneumoniae to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, and cefoxitin were about 85.0%, 93.2% (206/221), and 90.3% (200/221)of K. pneumoniae isolates were sensitive to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin.The mean prevalence of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae was 8.1% (18/221). No S. aureus isolates resistant to vancomycin were detected in this study.The sensitive rates of S. aureus to levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and rifampin were 83.5% (97/116), 82.8% (96/116), 89.6% (104/116) and 83.5% (97/116), respectively. 37.4% (43/116) and 34.8% (40/116)of S. aureus isolates were sensitive to erythromycin and chloramphenicol.All of the H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis isolates were sensitive to amoxicillin with clavulanic acid, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. The sensitive rates of H. influenza and M. catarrhalis to ampicillin, cefuroxime, cefaclor, erythromycin, azithromycin, and clarithromycin were from 80% to 100%. CONCLUSIONS: Penicillins, second-generation cephalosporins (cefuroxime and cefaclor) and amoxicillin with clavulanic acid showed low antimicrobial activity to S. pneumoniae, but a higher sensitive rate to ceftriaxone. The macrolides exhibited a high activity against H. influenza and M. catarrhalis, but low antimicrobial activity against S. pneumoniae and S. aureus. The antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones such as levofloxacin and moxifloxacin against most of the respiratory pathogens was high.
