Sixteen different sequence types (STs) of Escherichia coli isolates from a commercial swine farm in China were confirmed to coharbor the carbapenem resistance gene blaNDM-5 and the colistin resistance gene mcr-1 Whole-genome sequencing revealed that blaNDM-5 and mcr-1 were located on a 46-kb IncX3 plasmid and a 32-kb IncX4 plasmid, respectively. The two plasmids can transfer together with a low fitness cost, which might explain the presence of various STs of E. coli coharboring blaNDM-5 and mcr-1.
