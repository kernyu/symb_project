PROBLEM In this study, we explored the relationship between decidual cells (DC) and interferon (IFN)-gamma, in the presence or absence of ectoplacental cone (EC) using a coculture system. METHOD OF STUDY Decidual cells and EC were isolated from pregnant mice on gestation day 7.5. DCs were cultured for 48 hr and then treated with fresh EC. After characterization, they were treated with IFN-gamma, and cell death was evaluated. RESULTS Interferon-gamma drastically increased decidual apoptosis, which was partially reverted by the addition of EC to the IFN-gamma-treated decidual culture. Moreover, the addition of EC to non-treated DC cultures was also capable of attenuating death rates. CONCLUSION Resistance to apoptosis may be induced in DC by the EC. This suggests that EC may participate in the inhibition of IFN-gamma-dependent apoptosis and, therefore, play important role for DC survival in a cytokine-enriched placental environment.
