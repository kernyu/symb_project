The objective of this study was to determine risk factors for the development of resistance to beta-lactams/beta-lactamase inhibitors (betaL/betaLIs) and ertapenem among Bacteroides species bacteremia. We conducted a retrospective case-control study of 101 adult patients with Bacteroides species bacteremia at a 1,051-bed tertiary care medical center. The duration of exposure to betaL/betaLIs (odds ratio [OR], 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08 to 2.31) was the only independent risk factor for resistance.
