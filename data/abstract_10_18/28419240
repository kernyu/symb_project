The spread of antibiotic resistance and increasing prevalence of biofilm-associated infections is driving demand for new means to treat bacterial infection. Nanotechnology provides an innovative platform for addressing this challenge, with potential to manage even infections involving multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. The current review summarizes recent progress over the last 2 years in the field of antibacterial nanodrugs, and describes their unique properties, mode of action and activity against MDR bacteria and biofilms. Biocompatibility and commercialization are also discussed. As opposed to the more common division of nanoparticles (NPs) into organic- and inorganic-based materials, this review classifies NPs into two functional categories. The first includes NPs exhibiting intrinsic antibacterial properties and the second is devoted to NPs serving as a cargo for delivering antibacterial agents. Antibacterial nanomaterials used to decorate medical devices and implants are reviewed here as well.
