UNLABELLED: The antiviral activity, resistance profile, pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability of BMS-790052, a nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) replication complex inhibitor, were evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential panel, multiple ascending dose study. Thirty patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infection were randomized to receive a 14-day course of BMS-790052 (1, 10, 30, 60, or 100 mg once daily or 30 mg twice daily) or placebo in a ratio of 4:1. The mean maximum decline from baseline in HCV RNA ranged from 2.8 to 4.1 log(10) IU/mL; the placebo group showed no evidence of antiviral activity. Most patients experienced viral rebound on or before day 7 of treatment with BMS-790052 monotherapy; viral rebound was associated with viral variants that had been previously implicated in resistance development in the in vitro replicon system. The PK profile was supportive of once-daily dosing with median peak plasma concentrations at 1-2 hours postdose and mean terminal half-life of 12-15 hours. Steady state was achieved following 3-4 days of daily dosing. BMS-790052 was well tolerated in all dose groups, with adverse events occurring with a similar frequency in BMS-790052- and placebo-treated groups. There were no clinically relevant changes in vital signs, laboratory, or electrocardiogram parameters. CONCLUSION: BMS-7590052 is the first NS5A replication complex inhibitor with multiple dose proof-of-concept in clinic. At doses of 1-100 mg daily, BMS-790052 was well tolerated, had a PK profile supportive of once-daily dosing, and produced a rapid and substantial decrease in HCV-RNA levels in patients chronically infected with HCV genotype 1.
