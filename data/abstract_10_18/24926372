The present study aimed to investigate the pathogen distribution and drug resistance of lung infections in hemodialysis to guide clinical empirical pharmacy. The clinical data of 116 hemodialysis patients with pulmonary infection were analyzed. The majority of the 82 pathogens isolated from the sputa of patients were Gram-negative bacteria (accounting for 71.95%). The results of the drug sensitivity test suggested that Gram-negative bacilli had low resistance rates to piperacillin and tazobactam, imipenem and amikacin, while Gram-positive cocci had a low resistance rate to vancomycin. All resistance rates of the pathogens to other common antimicrobials were >50%. The pathogens resulting in lung infections in hemodialysis patients were mainly Gram-negative bacteria and were significantly resistant to various antibacterials. Results of the this study demonstrate that pathological examination should be performed as early as possible and effective antimicrobial agents should be chosen according to drug sensitivity test results.
