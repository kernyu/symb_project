INTRODUCTION: Integrase inhibitors (INIs) are the latest class of antiretroviral drugs approved for the treatment of HIV infection and are becoming 'standard' drugs in the treatment of both naive as well as heavily pretreated individuals with HIV. AREAS COVERED: Data on efficacy, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, drug-drug interactions and resistance are reviewed from the pivotal Phase III clinical trials published in PubMed high-impact medical journals or presented at international meetings. EXPERT OPINION: Due to their outstanding data of efficacy, tolerability, safety--shared by all three drugs (raltegravir, elvitegravir, dolutegravir) currently belonging to this new family of antiretrovirals--INIs have become part of the recommended initial antiretroviral therapy options. Some differences in dosing, drug-drug interactions and robustness/genetic barrier among the three drugs will provide the physician the characteristics to make the best choice.
