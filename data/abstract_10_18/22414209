BACKGROUND: Prior antibiotic exposure has been associated with the emergence of antibiotic resistance in subsequent bacterial infections, whose outcomes are typically worse than similar infections with more antibiotic susceptible infections. The influence of prior antibiotic exposure on hospital length of stay (LOS) and costs in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock attributed to Gram-negative bacteremia has not been previously examined. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of hospitalized patients (January 2002-December 2007) was performed at Barnes-Jewish Hospital, a 1200-bed urban teaching hospital. Patients with Gram-negative bacteremia complicated by severe sepsis or septic shock had data abstraction from computerized medical records. We examined a consecutive cohort of 754 subjects (mean age 59.3 +/- 16.3 yrs, mean APACHE II 23.7 +/- 6.7). RESULTS: Escherichia coli (30.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (23.2%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.6%) were the most common organisms isolated from blood cultures. 310 patients (41.1%) had exposure to antimicrobial agents in the previous 90 days. Patients with recent antibiotic exposure had greater inappropriate initial antimicrobial therapy (45.4% v. 21.2%; p < 0.001) and hospital mortality (51.3% v. 34.0%; p < 0.001) compared to patients without recent antibiotic exposure. The unadjusted median LOS (25th percentile, 75th percentile) following sepsis onset in patients with prior antimicrobial exposure was 13.0 days (5.0 days, 24.0 days) compared to 8.0 days (5.0 days, 14.0 days) in those without prior antimicrobial exposure (p < 0.001). In a Cox model controlling for multiple confounders, prior antibiotic exposure independently correlated with remaining hospitalized (Adjusted hazard ratio: 1.473, 95% CI: 1.297-1.672, p < 0.001). Adjusting for potential confounders indicated that prior antibiotic exposure independently increased median attributable LOS by 5.0 days. Similarly, total hospital costs following sepsis onset was significantly greater among patients with prior antimicrobial exposure (median values: $94,737 v. $21,329; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Recent antibiotic exposure is associated with increased LOS and hospital costs in Gram-negative bacteremia complicated by severe sepsis or septic shock. Clinicians and hospital administrators should consider the potential impact of recent antibiotic exposure when formulating empiric treatment decisions for patients with serious infections attributed to Gram-negative bacteria.
