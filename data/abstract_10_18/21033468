The data on antibacterial susceptibility and resistance of Vibrio cholerae eltor phenotypes with different sets of the susceptibility or resistance markers conditioning the outbreaks and sporadic cases of cholera in the Caucasus within 1970-1998 are presented. An increase of the number of the Vibrio cholerae phenotypes resistant to tetracycline and chloramphenicol usually used in the treatment of cholera was recorded in 1990-1994 vs. 1970-1989. The El Tor cholera vibrios stored on synthetic media lost some of their resistance markers, therefore the retrospective investigation of the antibioticograms was only of approximate prognostic value in the choice of the drugs for the etiotropic treatment of cholera in view of possible outbreak of the disease.
