Peritonitis is a major cause of morbidity in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Aeromonas hydrophila is a rare cause of peritonitis in patients on CAPD. We herewith report a 44-year-old female patient on CAPD with Aeromonas hydrophila peritonitis. Peritoneal fluid grew Aeromonas hydrophila. The patient reported that she had accidentally dropped her peritoneal dialysis catheter into the toilet. Susceptibility testing revealed that it is susceptible to ceftazidime, but resistant to ciprofloxacin. The patient was treated successfully with intravenous ceftazidime for 2 days followed by intraperitoneal ceftazidime for 12 days. She was discharged with complete recovery after 2 weeks of antibiotic treatment.
