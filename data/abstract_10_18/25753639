Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium are frequently resistant to vancomycin and beta-lactams. In enterococcal infections with reduced glycopeptide susceptibility, combination therapy is often administered. Our objective was to conduct pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) models to evaluate beta-lactam synergy with daptomycin (DAP) against resistant enterococci. One E. faecalis strain (R6981) and two E. faecium strains (R6370 and 8019) were evaluated. DAP MICs were obtained. All strains were evaluated for response to LL37, an antimicrobial peptide, in the presence and absence of ceftaroline (CPT), ertapenem (ERT), and ampicillin (AMP). After 96 h, in vitro models were run simulating 10 mg DAP/kg body weight/day, 600 mg CPT every 8 h (q8h), 2 g AMP q4h, and 1 g ERT q24h, both alone and in combination against all strains. DAP MICs were 2, 4, and 4 mug/ml for strains R6981, R6370, and 8019, respectively. PK/PD models demonstrated bactericidal activity with DAP-CPT, DAP-AMP, and DAP-ERT combinations against strain 8019 (P < 0.001 and log10 CFU/ml reduction of >2 compared to any single agent). Against strains R6981 and R6370, the DAP-AMP combination demonstrated enhancement against R6370 but not R6981, while the combinations of DAP-CPT and DAP-ERT were bactericidal, demonstrated enhancement, and were statistically superior to all other regimens at 96 h (P < 0.001) against both strains. CPT, ERT, and AMP similarly augmented LL37 killing against strain 8019. In strains R6981 and R6370, CPT and ERT aided LL37 more than AMP (P < 0.001). Compared to DAP alone, combination regimens provide better killing and prevent resistance. Clinical research involving DAP combinations is warranted.
