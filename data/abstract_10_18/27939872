In the present study, in vitro antimicrobial activity of Brevibacillus brevis EGS9 against multi drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MDRSA) and to investigate the antimicrobial, antioxidant activity and HPTLC finger print profile of Brevibacillus brevis EGS9. Primary screening was done using by cross streak method against multi drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The bioactive metabolites were extracted from Brevibacillus brevis EGS9 using ethyl acetate extraction. Ethyl acetate extract showed significant antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli (20.2 +/- 0.1) mm, Candida albicans (19.2 +/- 0.3) mm and Bacillus cereus (18.6 +/- 0.2) mm respectively. Forty three UTI bacterial strains were isolated from mid-urine samples of 50 males and 50 females. Escherichia coli were more predominant (48%) followed by Klebsilla pneumonia (29%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17%), Staphylococcus aureus (4%) and Enterobacter faecalis (6%). The ethyl acetate extract was examined to evaluate antibacterial properties against isolated UTIs bacterial pathogens. The results were revealed that the maximum zone was measured in Escherichia coli (18.1 +/- 0.4) mm and minimum zone of inhibition was shown against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.6 +/- 0.3) mm. Based on the results obtained, the extract of Brevibacillus brevis EGS9 exhibited dose dependent manner of antioxidant activity. The DPPH scavenging activity of lowest concentration at 25 mug/ml and high concentration at 1000 mug/ml was measured at 2.4% and 39.5% respectively. HPTLC finger print profile was showed the active compounds present in crude extract, which may responsible for the antioxidant prospective. These results showed that, the significant antimicrobial properties against pathogen; this work will be helpful to explore the active compound identification in the field of pharmaceutical research and able to produce new drug molecules against pathogens.
