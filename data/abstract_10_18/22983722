To explore CD4-cell and viral evolution in relation to different levels of HIV-1 replication, as observed during protease inhibitor (PI)-based antiretroviral therapy. Adult HIV-1 infected cohort patients, receiving historical salvage therapy with daily doses of saquinavir (2,000 mg), ritonavir (200 mg) and either lopinavir (800 mg) or atazanavir (300 mg) for >36 weeks were retrospectively analysed for highest detectable viral load up to week 96 and assigned to groups according to the viral load level: always <50 copies/ml (1), 50-199 copies/ml (2), 200-499 copies/ml (3) and >/=500 copies/ml (4). A total of 126 patients were evaluated; at baseline, median CD4-cell count was 204/mm(3), HIV-1 RNA was 5.13 Log10-copies/ml and duration of prior HIV-1 infection was 11.7 years. Patients were assigned by 43, 30, 7 and 20 % to groups 1-4. Median observation time was 136 weeks (range: 38-304); at weeks 48/96, the CD4-cell gains for groups 1-4 were +88/+209, +209/+349, +67/+300 and +114.5/+ 128, respectively. After fitting data in a linear fixed effect model, ascending CD4 slopes were continuously increasing for group 1, similarly for 2 and clearly decreasing for 3-4 (p = 0.0006). Of 25 individuals from group 4, patient number with major IAS-USA protease mutations increased from 5 to 10 before and after failing PI therapy, whereas minor mutations remained stable (n = 18). On double-boosted PI therapy, CD4-cell increases through week 96 were similar for patients at always undetectable or with detection of low viral load. Viral detection >200 copies/ml was associated with decreasing CD4-cell slopes and emergence of major mutations, supporting this as benchmark for virological failure definition on PI therapy.
