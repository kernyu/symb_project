Novel antifungals are in high demand as there is a growing resistance to antifungals currently in use. In particular, opportunistic fungal infections caused by Candida spp. are on the rise with infections by this genus accounting for the most severe fungal infections following chemotherapy, implantation procedures, and in patients with HIV/AIDS. A series of simple aurone analogs were synthesized and screened for antifungal activity versus Candida spp. Several compounds displayed activity at 100muM, with two having IC50 values below 20muM for three species of Candida. One of the compounds tested here also exhibits anti-biofilm activity for mid-maturation growth.
