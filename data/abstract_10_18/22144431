Ferroquine (FQ), a chloroquine (CQ) analog, is being developed to treat persons with Plasmodium falciparum malaria. In 146 P. falciparum field isolates from western Kenya, we measured 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50); nM) of CQ and FQ by a SYBR Green I in vitro assay. Reference clones included W2 (CQ resistant) and D6 (CQ sensitive). Mutation analysis was done for P. falciparum CQ-resistance transporter gene (Pfcrt K76T). Median IC(50) values for FQ were lower than CQ for field isolates and the W2 clone (both P < 0.05). The Pfcrt mutation (76T), which was detected in > 80% of isolates, conferred higher CQ IC(50) values (P < 0.05) and modestly lower FQ IC(50) values (P < 0.05), versus Pfcrt wild type (K76). FQ is more potent than CQ against CQ-resistant P. falciparum field isolates and the W2 clone, and is less affected by Pfcrt 76T. These findings support the notion that FQ could be useful in treating persons with P. falciparum malaria.
