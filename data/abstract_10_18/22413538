The increase of the infections caused by multi-drug-resistant bacteria is a serious problem worldwide. As for Gram-positive bacteria, the community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin- or linezolid-resistant strains have been increasing. As for Gram-negative bacteria, multi-drug-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii have been increasing due to the carbapenemase production recently. During these 10 years, various types of novel antibacterials targeted for Gram-positive bacteria have been approved in US and EU, but not in Japan. On the other hand, the discovery of new antibacterials targeted for Gram-negative bacteria is still immature. In this review, the status of the discovery of new antibacterials targeted for these multi-drug-resistant bacteria will be reviewed.
