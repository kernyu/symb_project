Klebsiella pneumoniae is responsible for a large number of hospital outbreaks. In the 1990s, there were clonal epidemics, affecting mostly intensive care patients, which carried SHV and TEM enzyme types. With the advent of CTX-M-15 enzymes in the 2000, plasmids encoding multiple extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) types were described and, frequently, nosocomial outbreaks reported polyclonal dissemination and involved multiple Enterobacteriaceae. Worryingly, the interface between community and hospital is becoming blurred, and there is increasing evidence for the presence of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae in the community. Furthermore, carbapenem resistance is increasingly reported in ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae strains. Infection control measures and stewardship programs are vital weapons in controlling the pandemic evolution of multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae.
