A substantial proportion of patients with lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) show suboptimal virologic response during rescue combination treatment with lamivudine plus adefovir. In this randomized active-control trial, 90 patients with serum HBV DNA levels of >2,000 IU/ml after at least 24 weeks of treatment with lamivudine-plus-adefovir therapy for lamivudine-resistant HBV were randomized to combination treatment with entecavir plus adefovir (ETV+ADV, n = 45) or continuation of lamivudine plus adefovir (LAM+ADV, n = 45) for 52 weeks. At baseline, patients' mean serum HBV DNA level was 4.60 log(10) IU/ml (standard deviation [SD], 1.03). All 90 patients completed 52 weeks of treatment. At week 52, the proportion of patients with serum HBV DNA levels of <60 IU/ml, the primary endpoint, was significantly higher in the ETV+ADV group than in the LAM+ADV group (n = 13, 29%, versus n = 2, 4%, respectively; P = 0.004). The mean reduction in serum HBV DNA levels from baseline was significantly greater in the ETV+ADV group than in the LAM+ADV group (-2.2 log(10) IU/ml versus -0.6 log(10) IU/ml, respectively; P < 0.001). At week 52, additional mutations causing resistance to adefovir or entecavir were analyzed in all patients with detectable HBV DNA by restriction fragment mass polymorphism assays and detected in none of the ETV+ADV group but in 15% of patients in the LAM+ADV group (P = 0.018). Safety and adverse event profiles were similar in the two groups. In conclusion, entecavir-plus-adefovir combination therapy provides superior virologic response and favorable resistance profiles, compared with the continuing lamivudine-plus-adefovir combination, in patients with lamivudine-resistant HBV who fail to respond to lamivudine-plus-adefovir combination therapy.
