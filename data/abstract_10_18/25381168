OBJECTIVES: Linezolid has been reported to remain active against 98% of staphylococci with resistance identified in 0.05% of Staphylococcus aureus and 1.4% of CoNS. The objective of this study was to characterize the linezolid-resistance mechanisms in the linezolid-resistant CoNS strains isolated in Japan. METHODS: Staphylococcus capitis strains exhibiting linezolid MICs >8 mg/L isolated from inpatients between 2012 and 2014 were screened for cfr and mutations in 23S rRNA, L3 and L4 by PCR/sequencing. Isolates were also examined for mutations in the rlmN gene. RESULTS: S. capitis had six 23S rRNA alleles. Five S. capitis isolates displayed linezolid MICs of 8, 16 and 32 mg/L. G2576U mutations were detected in three, four or five copies of 23S rRNA in all isolates. In two isolates exhibiting the highest linezolid MIC (32 mg/L) there was a large deletion in a single copy of 23S rRNA. Repeated 10 bp sequences were found in both 16S and 23S rRNAs, suggesting deletion by recombination between the repeats. One isolate had the mutation Ala-142-->Thr in the ribosomal protein L3. All linezolid-resistant isolates also demonstrated mutations in the gene encoding RlmN methyltransferase, leading to Thr-62-->Met and Gly-148-->Ser. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple mechanisms appeared to be responsible for the elevated linezolid resistance in S. capitis isolates: a G2576U mutation in different numbers of copies of 23S rRNA, loss of a single copy of 23S rRNA and a mutation in the ribosomal protein L3, suggesting the accumulation of independent mutational events.
