To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying interferon alpha (IFNalpha) treatment failure in hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients with chronic hepatitis, we aimed to develop an IFNalpha-resistant clone of HCV. By treating JFH-1-infected Huh7.5 cells with a prolonged low-dose treatment of IFNalpha, we selected a clone of HCV that survived against 100 U/ml of IFNalpha. By genetic analysis of this clone, we found four substitution mutations in the C-terminal coding sequence of non-structural 5A (NS5A). By introducing these four mutations into wild-type JFH-1, we established a new HCV clone that acquired IFNalpha resistant phenotype. These data suggest that four amino acid substitutions in NS5A are involved in IFNalpha resistance and thus this newly established HCV may be a useful tool for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of IFNalpha resistance in HCV patients.
