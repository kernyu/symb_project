BACKGROUND: Burns are common in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and complicated by unhygienic conditions, malnutrition, use of high-risk homemade dressings and delayed presentation. Resultantly, use of routine systemic antibiotic prophylaxis (SAP) to prevent wound infection is common practice despite this intervention being abandoned in high-income countries due to increased antimicrobial resistance and non-bacterial suprainfection. METHODS: A best evidence topic (BET) was constructed using a structured protocol. The question addressed was: In LMICs, does routine use of SAP reduce burn wound infection, morbidity or mortality? RESULTS: From 704 retrieved records, 48 reports met criteria to be examined. Of those, 3 studies represented the best available evidence. Together, two randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and a retrospective cohort study reported no difference in the proportion of wound infection, any infection or length of hospital stay between SAP groups and controls. One RCT described a greater proportion of wounds infected with P. aeruginosa among SAP arms compared to controls. The studies had few participants and significant methodological weaknesses. CONCLUSION: On the basis of limited, currently available evidence, the use of SAP cannot be recommended for patients in LMICs that present soon after burn injury.
