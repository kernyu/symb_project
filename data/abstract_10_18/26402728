Novel 4''-O-(trans-beta-arylacrylamido)carbamoyl azithromycin analogs were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial activity against nine significant pathogens using broth microdilution method. A majority of these derivatives maintained the activity of azithromycin against susceptible Streptococcus pyogenes and all the compounds demonstrated remarkably improved activity compared with the references against all the three phenotypes of resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. In particular, compound 24 exhibited the most potent activity against susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC = 0.5 mug/mL), S. pneumoniae (MIC = 0.06 mug/mL) and S. pyogenes (MIC = 0.25 mug/mL). The most active compound 7 (MIC = 0.015 mug/mL) against resistant S. pneumoniae expressing the mefA gene, exhibited 512 and 256-fold more potent activity than erythromycin and azithromycin, respectively. Compounds 28 (MIC = 0.5 mug/mL), 29 (MIC = 0.25 mug/mL) and 30 (MIC = 0.5 mug/mL) demonstrated potent activity against resistant S. pneumoniae expressing the ermB gene, which were 256, 512 and 256-fold better than the references, respectively.
