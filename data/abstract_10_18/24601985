Streptomyces scabies is a causal agent of common scab of potato, which generates necrotic tuber lesions. We have previously demonstrated that inoculation of potato plants with phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA)- producing Pseudomonas sp. LBUM223 could significantly reduce common scab symptoms. In the present study, we investigated whether LBUM223 or an isogenic phzC- mutant not producing PCA could elicit an induced systemic resistance response in potato. The expression of eight defense-related genes (salicylic acid [SA]-related ChtA, PR-1b, PR-2, and PR-5; and jasmonic acid and ethylene-related LOX, PIN2, PAL-2, and ERF3) was quantified using newly developed TaqMan reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays in 5- and 10-week-old potted potato plants. Although only wild-type LBUM223 was capable of significantly reducing common scab symptoms, the presence of both LBUM223 and its PCA-deficient mutant were equally able to upregulate the expression of LOX and PR-5. The presence of S. scabies overexpressed all SA-related genes. This indicates that (i) upregulation of potato defense-related genes by LBUM223 is unlikely to contribute to common scab's control and (ii) LBUM223's capacity to produce PCA is not involved in this upregulation. These results suggest that a direct interaction occurring between S. scabies and PCA-producing LBUM223 is more likely involved in controlling common scab development.
