BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is not a frequent pathogen in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). However, in patients with severe CAP, P aeruginosa can be the etiology in 1.8% to 8.3% of patients, with a case-fatality rate of 50% to 100%. We describe the prevalence, clinical characteristics, outcomes, and risk factors associated with CAP resulting from multidrug-resistant (MDR) and non-MDR P aeruginosa. METHODS: Prospective observational study of 2,023 consecutive adult patients with CAP with definitive etiology. RESULTS: P aeruginosa was found in 77 (4%) of the 2,023 cases with microbial etiology. In 22 (32%) of the 68 cases of P aeruginosa with antibiogram data, the isolates were MDR. Inappropriate therapy was present in 49 (64%) cases of P aeruginosa CAP, including 17/22 (77%) cases of MDR P aeruginosa CAP. Male sex, chronic respiratory disease, C-reactive protein <12.35 mg/dL, and pneumonia severity index risk class IV to V were independently associated with P aeruginosa CAP. Prior antibiotic treatment was more frequent in MDR P aeruginosa CAP compared with non-MDR P aeruginosa (58% vs 29%, P = .029), and was the only risk factor associated with CAP resulting from MDR P aeruginosa. In the multivariate analysis, age >/=65 years, CAP resulting from P aeruginosa, chronic liver disease, neurologic disease, nursing home, criteria of ARDS, acute renal failure, ICU admission, and inappropriate empiric treatment were the factors associated with 30-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: P aeruginosa is an individual risk factor associated with mortality in CAP. The risk factors described can help clinicians to suspect P aeruginosa and MDR P aeruginosa.
