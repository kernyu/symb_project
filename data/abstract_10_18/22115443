Fusarium asiaticum strains resistant to thiophanate-methyl were detected in four prefectures in Japan though their proportion in the total population was low in all instances. The F167Y or F200Y mutation in the beta2-tubulin gene (FGSG06611.3) was detected in thiophanate-methyl resistant (TMR) strains. A PCR-based diagnostic method based on these mutations was developed and applied for all 17 TMR strains that have been detected so far in Japan. Three and 14 TMR strains were the F167Y and F200Y mutation types, respectively. Analysis by 11 variable number of tandem repeat markers showed that TMR strains from the same site had an identical genotype, while TMR strains from different sites were dissimilar. This result indicates that TMR strains did not spread clonally to the different sites.
