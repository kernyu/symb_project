AIM: The aim of this study was to examine the impact of antibiotic consumption on development of antimicrobial resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was conducted in University Clinical Center of Sarajevo. In our retrospective study Acinetobacter baumannii isolated in period from July 1(st) 2009 to December 31(st) 2012. Isolates were detected from different clinical samples including urine, wound swab, blood, bronchial aspirate and other samples which were collected from patients situated on various hospital wards. Clinical isolates belonged to one per patient in a given period of time. RESULTS: Antimicrobial resistance was interpreted according to CLSI breakpoints. Consumption of antibiotics was analyzed according to recommendations of the ESAC-Net and current Acinetobacter baumannii classification. Pearson's correlation showed a positive correlation between gentamicin consumption and emerging of resistance (p = 0.023). CONCLUSION: Increase in the antimicrobial use was followed with an increase in resistance of Acinetobacter baumannii isolates. Monitoring of antibiotic resistance and consumption is of a great importance in order to reduce the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistant organisms in the health care settings.
