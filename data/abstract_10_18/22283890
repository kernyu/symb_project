A retrospective review was conducted of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) to elucidate the rate of recurrence after successful treatment. Of 123 MDR-TB patients, 90 were declared as 'cured' or 'treatment completed' after individualised treatment; four (4.4%) experienced recurrence. All patients with recur- rent MDR-TB were documented as 'treatment completed' after treatment. Recurrence of MDR-TB is possible after successful treatment, particularly among those documented as 'treatment completed'.
