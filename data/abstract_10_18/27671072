Infections with the Gram-negative coccobacillus Acinetobacter baumannii are a major threat in hospital settings. The progressing emergence of multidrug-resistant clinical strains significantly reduces the treatment options for clinicians to fight A. baumannii infections. The current lack of robust methods to genetically manipulate drug-resistant A. baumannii isolates impedes research on resistance and virulence mechanisms in clinically relevant strains. In this study, we developed a highly efficient and versatile genome-editing platform enabling the markerless modification of the genome of A. baumannii clinical and laboratory strains, regardless of their resistance profiles. We applied this method for the deletion of AdeR, a transcription factor that regulates the expression of the AdeABC efflux pump in tigecycline-resistant A. baumannii, to evaluate its function as a putative drug target. Loss of adeR reduced the MIC90 of tigecycline from 25 mug/ml in the parental strains to 3.1 mug/ml in the DeltaadeR mutants, indicating its importance in the drug resistance phenotype. However, 60% of the clinical isolates remained nonsusceptible to tigecycline after adeR deletion. Evolution of artificial tigecycline resistance in two strains followed by whole-genome sequencing revealed loss-of-function mutations in trm, suggesting its role in an alternative AdeABC-independent tigecycline resistance mechanism. This finding was strengthened by the confirmation of trm disruption in the majority of the tigecycline-resistant clinical isolates. This study highlights the development and application of a powerful genome-editing platform for A. baumannii enabling future research on drug resistance and virulence pathways in clinically relevant strains.
