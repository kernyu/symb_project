A 77-year-old man had undergone left-lobe liver resection and a choledochojejunostomy six years previously, and thereafter he suffered from a postoperative relapse of cholangitis. He was admitted to our hospital due to liver abscesses and bacteremia caused by multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Empirical treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam was started, and the patient initially recovered. However, he developed a second case of sepsis caused by piperacillin/tazobactam-resistant P. aeruginosa bacteremia originating from a new liver abscess. We changed the piperacillin/tazobactam to colistin and flomoxef and continued the two antibiotics for one month. During the antibiotic therapy, the patient successfully underwent bile duct stent placement.
