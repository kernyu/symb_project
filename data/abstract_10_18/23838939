BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (Hp) eradication fails in about 10% of patients because of the occurrence of resistance to antibiotics and side-effects. During anti H.pylori therapy, probiotics have been used to reduce the incidence of side-effects. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether adding the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamhousus GG to an anti-H. pylori regimen could help to prevent or minimize the gastrointestinal side-effect burden. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 66 subjects screening positive for H. pylori infection (male/female: 45/21, mean age 56,6 DS +/- 16,7 year ), 59 subjects receiving 7 days of Omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d, Amoxicillin 1000 mg b.i.d and Clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d were randomly assigned to Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (6 x 9 ufc b.i.d ) (n = 29) or placebo (n = 30). Patients completed questionnaires after the treatment to determine the type and 10 severity of side-effects. RESULTS: Side effects occurred mainly during the eradication therapy; none of them caused therapy discontinuation. Bloating, diarrhea, taste disturbance and epigastric discomfort were the most frequent side effects: (10.3% versus 16%, 13.8% versus 20%, 13.7% versus 20% and 13.7 % versus 20% respectively). No significant differences were found between the two groups for individual symptoms. CONCLUSION: In this study, probiotic supplementation did not diminish significantly the frequency of new or aggravated symptoms during H. pylori eradication.
