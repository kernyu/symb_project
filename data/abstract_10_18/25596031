Escherichia coli ST131 emerged during the early to mid-2000s is an important human pathogen, has spread extensively throughout the world, and is responsible for the rapid increase in antimicrobial resistance among E. coli. ST131 is known to cause extraintestinal infections, being fluoroquinolone resistant, and is associated with ESBL production most often due to CTX-M-15. Recent molecular epidemiologic studies using whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis have demonstrated that the H30 ST131 lineage emerged in early 2000s that was followed by the rapid expansion of its sublineages H30-R and H30-Rx. Escherichia coli ST131 clearly has all of the essential characteristics that define a high-risk clone and might be the quintessential example of an international multiresistant high-risk clone. We urgently need rapid cost-effective detection methods for E. coli ST131, as well as well-designed epidemiological and molecular studies to understand the dynamics of transmission, risk factors, and reservoirs for ST131. This will provide insight into the emergence and spread of this multiresistant sequence type that will hopefully lead to information essential for preventing the spread of ST131.
