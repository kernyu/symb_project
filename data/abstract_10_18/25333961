OBJECTIVE: To assess the presence of two major non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) drug resistance mutations (DRMs), Y181C and K103N, in minor viral quasispecies of treatment naive HIV-1 infected East-African and Swedish patients by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR). METHODS: Treatment naive adults (n=191) with three epidemiological backgrounds were included: 92 Ethiopians living in Ethiopia; 55 East-Africans who had migrated to Sweden; and 44 Caucasians living in Sweden. The pol gene was analysed by standard population sequencing and by AS-PCR for the detection of Y181C and K103N. RESULTS: The Y181C was detected in the minority quasispecies of six Ethiopians (6.5%), in two Caucasians (4.5%), and in one East-African (1.8%). The K103N was detected in one East- African (1.8%), by both methods. The proportion of mutants ranged from 0.25% to 17.5%. Additional DRMs were found in all three treatment naive patient groups by population sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: Major NNRTI mutations can be found by AS-PCR in minor quasispecies of treatment naive HIV-1 infected Ethiopians living in Ethiopia, in East-African and Caucasian patients living in Sweden in whom population sequencing reveal wild-type virus only. Surveys with standard sequencing are likely to underestimate transmitted drug resistance and the presence of resistant minor quasispecies in treatment naive patients should be topic for future large scale studies.
