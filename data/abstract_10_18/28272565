BACKGROUND: Residents in nursing homes have a higher risk of developing infections that require antibiotic treatment than elderly people living at home. Use of antibiotics may cause adverse effects and result in the development of antimicrobial resistance. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Data on healthcare-associated infections and antibiotic use in 540 Norwegian nursing homes were retrieved from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health's point prevalence survey in the spring of 2016. Based on information on drug, dosage and indication, we assessed whether the use of antibiotics for the treatment of UTIs was in accordance with the National Guidelines for the Use of Antibiotics in Primary Care. RESULTS: UTI was the most commonly occurring type of infection, with a prevalence of 2.7 %. Prescription of first-line antibiotics accounted for approximately 60 % of the prescriptions for treatment of this illness. Choice of drug, dosage and microbiological testing when treating lower UTIs was not always in accordance with the national guidelines. The study showed widespread use of methenamine in Norwegian nursing homes. INTERPRETATION: The survey indicates that compliance with the national guidelines when treating lower UTIs could be improved with regard to the choice of drug, dosage and microbiological testing. Norwegian nursing home doctors should also consider whether their use of methenamine is in accordance with national and international recommendations.
