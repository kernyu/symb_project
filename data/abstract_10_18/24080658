The purpose of this study was to determine if the disposition of cefadroxil, an alpha-amino-containing beta-lactam antibiotic, changes during lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute inflammation. Six hours after LPS or saline treatment, mice received 1 nmol/g cefadroxil intravenously along with inulin for glomerular filtration rate (GFR) determination. Serial blood samples, along with tissue and urine samples, were collected at predetermined time points. In order to determine inflammation-induced changes in GFR, renal tubular secretion, and reabsorption, it was necessary to coadminister 70 mg/kg probenecid. Changes in the expression of the mRNA of transporters involved in cefadroxil disposition in the kidneys and choroid plexus were also investigated 6 h after LPS treatment. The results demonstrated marked increases in blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and tissue cefadroxil concentrations with LPS treatment. Tissue-to-blood concentration ratios were decreased by 4.6-fold in the choroid plexus and by 2.5-fold in the kidneys during LPS-induced inflammation. Renal, but not choroid plexus, mRNA expression of peptide transporter 2, organic-anion transporter 1 (OAT1), OAT3, and multidrug resistance-associated protein 4 was mildly reduced in LPS-treated mice. The renal clearance of cefadroxil was substantially decreased by LPS treatment (3-fold). GFR was also reduced by 3-fold in LPS-treated mice, but no significant differences in the fractional reabsorption of cefadroxil and renal secretion once normalized by GFR were observed. These findings demonstrated that LPS-induced inflammation has a dramatic effect on the renal excretion of cefadroxil. It appears that changes in transporter expression played a minor role during LPS treatment but that renal dysfunction, associated with GFR reduction, was responsible for the substantial increase in plasma cefadroxil concentration-time profiles.
