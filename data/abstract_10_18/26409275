Continued progress in addressing challenges associated with detection and management of tuberculosis requires new diagnostic tools. These tools must be able to provide rapid and accurate information for detecting resistance to guide selection of the treatment regimen for each patient. To achieve this goal, globally representative genotypic, phenotypic, and clinical data are needed in a standardized and curated data platform. A global partnership of academic institutions, public health agencies, and nongovernmental organizations has been established to develop a tuberculosis relational sequencing data platform (ReSeqTB) that seeks to increase understanding of the genetic basis of resistance by correlating molecular data with results from drug susceptibility testing and, optimally, associated patient outcomes. These data will inform development of new diagnostics, facilitate clinical decision making, and improve surveillance for drug resistance. ReSeqTB offers an opportunity for collaboration to achieve improved patient outcomes and to advance efforts to prevent and control this devastating disease.
