The bacterial cell envelope is believed to be a principal target for initiating the staphylocidal pathway of chitosan. The present study was therefore designed to investigate possible changes in cell surface phenotypes related to the in vitro chitosan resistance development in the laboratory strain S. aureus SG511-Berlin. Following a serial passage experiment, a stable chitosan-resistant variant (CRV) was identified, exhibiting >50-fold reduction in its sensitivity towards chitosan. Our analyses of the CRV identified phenotypic and genotypic features that readily distinguished it from its chitosan-susceptible parental strain, including: (i) a lower overall negative cell surface charge; (ii) cross-resistance to a number of antimicrobial agents; (iii) major alterations in cell envelope structure, cellular bioenergetics and metabolism (based on transcriptional profiling); and (iv) a repaired sensor histidine kinase GraS. Our data therefore suggest a close nexus between changes in cell envelope properties with the in vitro chitosan-resistant phenotype in S. aureus SG511-Berlin.
