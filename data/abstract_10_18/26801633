AIMS: Metallothionein 2A (MT2A) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) are both involved in carcinogenesis and cancer chemosensitivity. We previously showed decreased expression of MT2A and IkappaB-alpha in human gastric cancer (GC) associated with poor prognosis of GC patients. The present study investigated the effect of diallyl trisulfide (DATS), a garlic-derived compound, and docetaxel (DOC) on regulation of MT2A in relation to NF-kappaB in GC cells. RESULTS: DATS attenuated NF-kappaB signaling in GC cells, resulting in G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, culminating in the inhibition of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in nude mice. The anti-GC effect of DATS was attributable to its capacity to epigenetically upregulate MT2A, which in turn enhanced transcription of IkappaB-alpha to suppress NF-kappaB activation in GC cells. The combination of DATS with DOC exhibited a synergistic anti-GC activity accompanied by MT2A upregulation and NF-kappaB inactivation. Histopathologic analysis of GC specimens from patients showed a significant increase in MT2A expression following DOC treatment. GC patients with high MT2A expression in tumor specimens showed significantly improved response to chemotherapy and prolonged survival compared with those with low MT2A expression in tumors. INNOVATION AND CONCLUSION: We conclude that DATS exerts its anti-GC activity and enhances chemosensitivity of GC to DOC by epigenetic upregulation of MT2A to attenuate NF-kappaB signaling. Our findings delineate a mechanistic basis of MT2A/NF-kappaB signaling for DATS- and DOC-mediated anti-GC effects, suggesting that MT2A may be a chemosensitivity indicator in GC patients receiving DOC-based treatment and a promising target for more effective treatment of GC by combination of DATS and DOC.
