The rapid evolution and dissemination of antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens are outpacing the development of new antibiotics, but antivirulence agents provide an alternative. These agents can circumvent antibiotic resistance by disarming pathogens of virulence factors that facilitate human disease while leaving bacterial growth pathways - the target of traditional antibiotics - intact. Either as stand-alone medications or together with antibiotics, these drugs are intended to treat bacterial infections in a largely pathogen-specific manner. Notably, development of antivirulence drugs requires an in-depth understanding of the roles that diverse virulence factors have in disease processes. In this Review, we outline the theory behind antivirulence strategies and provide examples of bacterial features that can be targeted by antivirulence approaches. Furthermore, we discuss the recent successes and failures of this paradigm, and new developments that are in the pipeline.
