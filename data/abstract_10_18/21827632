d-boroAla was previously characterized as an inhibitor of bacterial alanine racemase and d-Ala-d-Ala ligase enzymes (Biochemistry, 28, 1989, 3541). In this study, d-boroAla was identified and characterized as an antibacterial agent. d-boroAla has activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, with minimal inhibitory concentrations down to 8 mug / mL. A structure-function study on the alkyl side chain (NH(2) -CHR-B(OR')(2) ) revealed that d-boroAla is the most effective agent in a series including boroGly, d-boroHomoAla, and d-boroVal. l-boroAla was much less active, and N-acetylation completely abolished activity. An LC-MS / MS assay was used to demonstrate that d-boroAla exerts its antibacterial activity by inhibition of d-Ala-d-Ala ligase. d-boroAla is bactericidal at 1x minimal inhibitory concentration against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis, which each encode one copy of d-Ala-d-Ala ligase, and at 4x minimal inhibitory concentration against Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, which each encode two copies of d-Ala-d-Ala ligase. d-boroAla demonstrated a frequency of resistance of 8 x 10(-8) at 4x minimal inhibitory concentration in S. aureus. These results demonstrate that d-boroAla has promising antibacterial activity and could serve as the lead agent in a new class of d-Ala-d-Ala ligase targeted antibacterial agents. This study also demonstrates d-boroAla as a possible probe for d-Ala-d-Ala ligase function.
