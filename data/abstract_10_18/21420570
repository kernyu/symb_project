The echinocandins anidulafungin, caspofungin, and micafungin have a broad and similar spectrum of in vitro and in vivo activity against most Candida spp. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for Candida spp. are usually below 1 mug/mL for most isolates. The exceptions are Candidaparapsilosis and C. guilliermondii. Species-specific clinical breakpoints (CBPs) and epidemiologic cutoff values (ECVs) have been proposed by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) for the eight most common Candida spp. versus each echinocandin; these values are useful to detect in vitro antifungal resistance (CBPs) and to identify isolates harboring fks mutations or having reduced susceptibility (ECVs). This paper presents a review of the literature (2006-2010) regarding the in vitro activity similarities or differences among the three echinocandins against Candida spp.; different parameters or measurements of in vitro potency were evaluated. The focus of the review is the non-Candida albicans species.
