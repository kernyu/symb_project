Bacterial infections are among the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in Nursing Homes (NH) and other long term care facilities. Multi-drug resistant organisms (MDROs) represent an ever-increasing share of causative agents of infection, and their prevalence in NHs is now just as high as in acute-care facilities, or even higher. Indeed, NHs are now considered a major reservoir of MDROs for the community at large. Asymptomatic colonization is usually a prerequisite to development of symptomatic infection. While progress has been made in defining epidemiology of MDROs in NHs, few studies have evaluated the role of changing healthcare delivery in introducing and further transmitting MDROs in this setting. Furthermore, the factors influencing the spread of colonization and the key prognostic indicators leading to symptomatic infections in the burgeoning short stay population need to be explored further. The difficulty of this task lies in the heterogeneity of NHs in terms of focus of care, organization and resources, and on the diversity among the many MDRO species encountered, which harbor different resistance genes and with a different prevalence depending on the geographic location, local antimicrobial pressure and residents risk factors such as use of indwelling devices, functional disability, wounds and other comorbidities. We present literature findings on the scope and importance of colonization as a pathway to infection with MDROs in NHs, underline important open questions that need further research, and discuss the strength of the evidence for current and proposed screening, prevention, and management interventions.
