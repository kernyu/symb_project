BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to analyze the resistance and virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains causing urinary tract infections in in- and outpatients in Southern Poland. METHODS: The study included 83 inpatients and 66 outpatients; 36.9% were female. RESULTS: Monomicrobial infections accounted for 74.5%; polymicrobial infections occurred more frequently among inpatients (odds ratio, OR = 4.32, p = 0.0008). exoS and lasB were detected in 90 and 74% of isolates, respectively. aprA was present in 66%, pilB in 5% and pilA in 23% of isolates. Isolates from adults were more frequently resistant to fluoroquinolones (OR = 0.37, p = 0.029). Twenty-nine isolates were classified as multidrug resistant and 12 as extremely drug resistant, which occurred less frequently in patients <17 years (OR = 0.18, p = 0.024). Nine metallo-beta-lactamase-positive isolates were identified. blaSHV was present in 10, blaTEM in 6, blaOXA-10 in 3 and blaVIM-2 in 3 isolates. CONCLUSION: Antibiotic selection should be based on the knowledge of local antimicrobial susceptibilities to maximize the benefit for patients and minimize the risk of drug resistance.
