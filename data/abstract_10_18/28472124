Culture based phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) is time consuming therefore rapid genotypic methods are increasingly being utilized. We previously developed and evaluated on TB isolates a rapid genotypic TaqMan array card (TAC) that detects mutations in several resistance-associated genes using dozens of primer pairs, probes, and high resolution melt analysis, with >96% accuracy versus Sanger sequencing. In this study we examined the performance of TAC on sputum, comparing results between 71 paired sputum and TB isolates of which 62 were MDR-TB. We also adapted the TAC to include wild-type probes and broadened coverage for rpoB and gyrA mutations. TAC was 89% successful at detecting wild-type or mutations within inhA, katG, rpoB, eis, gyrA, rplC, and pncA on smear positive sputa and 33% successful on smear negative sputa. The overall accuracy of these detections as compared to the TAC results of the paired isolate was 95% +/- 7 (average sensitivity 98% +/- 3; specificity 92% +/- 14). Accuracy of sputum TAC results versus phenotypic DST for isoniazid, rifampin, ofloxacin/moxifloxacin, and pyrazinamide was 85% +/- 12. This was similar to that of the isolate TAC results (accuracy 88% +/- 13), thus inaccuracies primarily reflected intrinsic genotypic-phenotypic discordance. The TAC is a rapid, modular, comprehensive, and accurate TB DST for the major first and second line TB drugs and could be used for supplemental testing of GeneXpert resistant smear positive sputum.
