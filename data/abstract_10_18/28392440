In this study, the prevalence and characteristics of metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates in South Korea were investigated. Among 215 P. aeruginosa isolates collected from eight hospitals, 77 (35.8%) and 72 (33.5%) were resistant to imipenem and meropenem, respectively. Of the 77 imipenem-resistant isolates, MBL genes were identified in 34 isolates (blaIMP-6 in 33 isolates and blaVIM-2 in 1 isolate). All of the MBL-producing isolates belonged to a globally prevailing genotype, sequence type 235 (ST235), and all of the IMP-6-producing isolates showed a deletion of nucleotide 209 of the porin gene oprD. Of the 33 IMP-6-producing ST235 isolates, 9 were resistant to colistin and exhibited resistance to all antimicrobial agents included in this study. PhoPQ and PmrAB amino acid alterations were not identical in the colistin-resistant isolates, indicating independent emergence of colistin resistance in this high-risk clone. Carbapenem resistance in P. aeruginosa has increased in South Korea owing to the dissemination of IMP-6-producing ST235 isolates, which showed high-level resistance to meropenem. Emergence of colistin resistance in the disseminated resistant clone would be a significant threat because few alternatives are left for the treatment of systemic infections.
