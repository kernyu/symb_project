Establishment of an intracellular niche within mammalian cells is key to the pathogenesis of the gastrointestinal bacterium, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium). Here we will describe how to study the internalization of S. Typhimurium into human epithelial cells using the gentamicin protection assay. The assay takes advantage of the relatively poor penetration of gentamicin into mammalian cells; internalized bacteria are effectively protected from its antibacterial actions. A second assay, the chloroquine (CHQ) resistance assay, can be used to determine the proportion of internalized bacteria that have lysed or damaged their Salmonella-containing vacuole and are therefore residing within the cytosol. Its application to the quantification of cytosolic S. Typhimurium in epithelial cells will also be presented. Together, these protocols provide an inexpensive, rapid and sensitive quantitative measure of bacterial internalization and vacuole lysis by S. Typhimurium.
