Multidrug-resistant carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KpC) strains are becoming a common cause of infections in health care centers. Furthermore, Klebsiella can develop multicellular biofilms, which lead to elevated adaptive antibiotic resistance. Here, we describe the antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of synthetic peptides DJK-5, DJK-6, and 1018 against five KpC isolates. Using static microplate assays, it was observed that the concentration required to prevent biofilm formation by these clinical isolates was below the MIC for planktonic cells. More-sophisticated flow cell experiments confirmed the antibiofilm activity of the peptides against 2-day-old biofilms of different KpC isolates, and in some cases, the peptides induced significant biofilm cell death. Clinically relevant combinations of DJK-6 and beta-lactam antibiotics, including the carbapenem meropenem, also prevented planktonic growth and biofilm formation of KpC strain1825971. Interestingly, peptide DJK-6 was able to enhance, at least 16-fold, the ability of meropenem to eradicate preformed biofilms formed by this strain. Using peptide DJK-6 to potentiate the activity of beta-lactams, including meropenem, represents a promising strategy to treat infections caused by KpC isolates.
