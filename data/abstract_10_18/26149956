Three KPC-2-producing Escherichia coli (E1, E2, and E3) were recovered from water samples of an urban river in the city of Harbin, China. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution. Molecular characterization and genetic relatedness of the isolates were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and PCR-directed phylotyping. Plasmids were analyzed by conjugation, S1-PFGE, Southern blotting and PCR-based replicon typing (PBRT). The genetic environment of the bla KPC-2 gene was determined using PCR and sequencing. PCR analyses revealed that the E1 isolate carried the bla KPC-2, bla CMY-2, bla TEM-1, bla CTX-M-14, and qnrB2 genes and belonged to sequence type ST410, phylogenetic type A; the E2 isolate was assigned to ST131-B2 and carried the bla KPC-2, bla TEM-1, bla CTX-M-3, bla DHA-1, aac(6')-Ib-cr, and qnrS1 genes; while the E3 isolate was of ST648-D and possessed bla KPC-2, bla TEM-1, bla OXA-1, bla CTX-M-15, armA, and aac(6')-Ib-cr genes. PFGE demonstrated that each of the three KPC-2-producing E. coli isolates exhibited an individual XbaI patterns. The bla KPC-2 gene was located on plasmids of 60-140 kb with IncA/C, IncN, or non-typeable replicon types. The genetic environment of bla KPC-2 of the three strains was consistent with the genetic structure of bla KPC-2 on the plasmid pKP048.
