In plants, most Cys2/His2 (C2H2) zinc finger proteins with two zinc finger domains (ZPT2) are involved in abiotic stress responses. In this study, a ZPT2 family gene PtrZPT2-1 was cloned from trifoliate orange (Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf.). PtrZPT2-1 is composed of 245 amino acids, has a putative molecular weight of 25.99kDa and an isoelectric point of 8.41. PtrZPT2-1 contained two C2H2 zinc finger domains, one nuclear localization signal (B-box), one transcription repression domain (DLN-box), and one protein-protein interaction domain (L-box). PtrZPT2-1 was localized to the nucleus. The PtrZPT2-1 expression was strongly induced by cold, drought, salt and ABA stresses. Overexpression of PtrZPT2-1 increased the survival rates, and the ABA, soluble sugar and proline levels but decreased the ion leakage, the malondialdehyde (MDA) content and reduced the H2O2 accumulation in the transgenic tobacco after cold, drought or salt treatments. Furthermore, the expression levels of 15 abiotic stress-related genes were significantly increased in the transgenic tobacco overexpressing PtrZPT2-1 after cold, drought or salt stress treatments. Our results indicated that overexpression of PtrZPT2-1 in the transgenic tobacco could improve the cold, drought and salt resistance of the plants by increasing the levels of osmotic regulatory solutes and decreasing the accumulation of H2O2.
