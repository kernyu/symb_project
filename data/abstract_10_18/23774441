Clinical development of CEM-102 (fusidic acid) has recently begun in the United States for chronic oral treatment of prosthetic joint infections. To support this development, the in vitro activity of fusidic acid against important Staphylococcus aureus clones and resistance phenotypes was determined. Against 51 such isolates, the modal fusidic acid MIC was 0.12 mug/ml (range, 0.06 to 0.25 mug/ml for 49 isolates). This level of in vitro fusidic acid activity underscores the potential clinical utility of this compound in the United States.
