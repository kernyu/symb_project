A carbapenem-resistant Enterobacter cloacae strain, WCHECl-14653, causing a fatal bloodstream infection, was characterized by genome sequencing and conjugation experiments. The strain carried two carbapenemase genes, blaNDM-1 and blaKPC-2, on separate IncF plasmids. The coexistence of blaNDM-1 and blaKPC-2 conferred slightly higher-level carbapenem resistance compared with that of blaNDM-1 or blaKPC-2 alone, and the coexistence of two IncF plasmids may generate new platforms for spreading carbapenemase genes.
