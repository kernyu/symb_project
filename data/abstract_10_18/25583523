Two-component systems play important roles in the physiology of many bacterial pathogens. Vibrio cholerae's CarRS two-component regulatory system negatively regulates expression of vps (Vibrio polysaccharide) genes and biofilm formation. In this study, we report that CarR confers polymyxin B resistance by positively regulating expression of the almEFG genes, whose products are required for glycine and diglycine modification of lipid A. We determined that CarR directly binds to the regulatory region of the almEFG operon. Similarly to a carR mutant, strains lacking almE, almF, and almG exhibited enhanced polymyxin B sensitivity. We also observed that strains lacking almE or the almEFG operon have enhanced biofilm formation. Our results reveal that CarR regulates biofilm formation and antimicrobial peptide resistance in V. cholerae.
