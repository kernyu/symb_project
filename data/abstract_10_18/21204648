Wei Kang Su (WKS) is an antioxidant-enriched herbal product manufactured on the basis of Shengmai San, a well-known traditional Chinese herbal formula. In the present study, we investigated the effects of WKS co-treatment on chronic ethanol toxicity in rats. WKS co-treatment protected against chronic ethanol-induced hepatotoxicity, as evidenced by the suppression of plasma enzyme activities and reactive oxygen metabolite levels, as well as the inhibition of hepatic mitochondrial malondialdehyde production in chronic ethanol-intoxicated rats. The hepatoprotection afforded by WKS co-treatment in chronic ethanol-intoxicated rats was associated with a reversal of altered hepatic mitochondrial antioxidant status and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation capacity, as well as heat shock protein 25/70 production. Therefore, WKS may offer the prospect of preventing ethanol-associated liver damage by increasing the resistance of mitochondria to oxidative stress.
