B cell activating factor belonging to the TNF family (BAFF, also called BLyS, TALL-1, THANK, or zTNF4) is an important survival factor for B cells, and is able to regulate T-cell activation. Recently, we have demonstrated that treatment of mice with human soluble BAFF (hsBAFF) causes a significant increase of percentages of splenic CD4(+) T lymphocytes dose-dependently, but the CD8(+) T lymphocyte percentages maintained unchanged. Here, we show that hsBAFF significantly enhanced CD4(+) T lymphocyte response of cultured mouse splenic cells, and hsBAFF induced the proliferation and IL-2/IFN-gamma secretion of purified CD4(+) T lymphocytes suboptimally stimulated through anti-CD3. Of importance, we observed that IL-2 or IFN-gamma cytokine has additive effect on the proliferation and activity of hsBAFF-stimulated CD4(+) T lymphocytes. Using Flow cytometry with fluorescent probe, Fluo-3/AM, we found that hsBAFF elicited [Ca(2+)](i) elevation contributing to CD4(+) T cell proliferation. This is evidenced by our finding that pretreatment with BAPTA/AM, an intracellular Ca(2+) chelator, significantly attenuated the proliferation of hsBAFF-stimulated CD4(+) T lymphocytes. Subsequently, we revealed that hsBAFF-stimulated CD4(+) T cell proliferation was markedly suppressed after pretreatment with EGTA, an extracellular Ca(2+) chelator, or with 2-APB, an inhibitor of Ca(2+) influx through CRAC channels, respectively, suggesting that extracellular Ca(2+) influx due to hsBAFF is closely associated with [Ca(2+)](i) elevation contributing to CD4(+) T cell proliferation. In addition, we noticed that hsBAFF-treated cells conferred partial resistance to decrease of cellular viability induced by thapsigargin (Tg), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor. Taken together, our data indicate that hsBAFF may promote CD4(+) T cell proliferation and response by upregulation of [Ca(2+)](i) homeostasis.
