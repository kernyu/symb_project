Serum albumin can be transformed to a stimuli (pH and redox) responsive hydrogel using the reduction process followed by oxidative refolding. The preparation of albumin hydrogel involves a range of concentrations (75, 150, 300, 450, 600 and 750 muM) and pH (2.0-10.0) values and the gelation begins at a concentration of 150 muM and 4.5-8.0 pH value. The hydrogel shows maximum swelling at alkali pH (pH > 9.0). The increase in albumin concentration increases hydrogel stability, rheological property, compressive strength, proteolytic resistance and rate of in vivo biodegradation. Based on the observed physical and biological properties of albumin hydrogel, 450 muM was determined to be an optimum concentration for further experiments. In addition, the hemo- and cytocompatibility analyses revealed the biocompatibility nature of albumin hydrogel. The experiments on in vitro drug (Tetracycline) delivery were carried out under non reducing and reducing conditions that resulted in the sustained and fast release of the drug, respectively. The methodology used in the preparation of albumin hydrogel may lead to the development of autogenic tissue constructs. In addition, the methodology can have various applications in tissue engineering and drug delivery.
