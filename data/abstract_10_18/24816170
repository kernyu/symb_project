We report 3 consecutive episodes of invasive aspergillosis in a single hematopoietic stem cell transplant patient successively attributed to TR(34) /L98H azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus and to a first occurrence of invasive Emericella sublata infection. This case illustrates potential selection of resistant molds during antifungal therapy in hematological patient.
