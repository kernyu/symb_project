OBJECTIVES: To study serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance to beta-lactams and macrolides in pneumococci causing respiratory diseases after the introduction of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in Saudi Arabia. Methods: This is a hospital-based and a cross-sectional prospective surveillance study conducted at King Fahad Hospital of the University, AlKhobar, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in which respiratory pneumococcal isolates collected between 2012 and 2014 were serotyped by multiplex sequential polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Pneumotest-Latex. Resistance genes to beta-lactams and macrolides were detected by multiplex PCR. Results: The most common serotypes encountered were 11A, 19A, 17F, 23F, 3, and 19F, representing 64% of the typeable strains. Interestingly, 24% of the 94 isolates were not typeable and 18% were negative for the housekeeping gene cpsA. Among the 53 typeable pneumococci isolates, 36 (67.9%) carried genes encoding resistance to both penicillin and macrolides, 9 (17%) were penicillin-monoresistant, 3 (5.6%) were macrolide-monoresistant, and 5 (9.4%) were designated non-resistant. The high rate of resistance genes did not significantly differ according to serotype (p=0.76). Similarly, non-typeable pneumococci (cpsA+ and cpsA-) had high rates of resistance to both penicillin (62.5%) and macrolides (47%). Conclusion: These data highlight the emergence of a previously rare capsular type, 11A (mean patient age, 29 years; p=0.001). Moreover, the high percentage of non-typeable isolates shows the emergence of possible atypical pneumococcal serotypes not covered by available vaccines.
