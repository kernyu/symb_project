IMPORTANCE: To our knowledge, these are the first reports of bloodstream infections by Trichosporon inkin in patients with pemphigus. OBSERVATIONS: Trichosporon inkin, a novel organism causing bloodstream infection, was detected in 2 patients with pemphigus. An elderly man with pemphigus foliaceus died despite treatment with liposomal amphotericin B, 3 mg/kg/d, and a young girl with pemphigus vulgaris responded to treatment with voriconazole, 8 mg/kg/d, for 24 days. One of the T inkin isolates had a minimal inhibitory concentration of 2 mg/L against amphotericin B, suggesting resistance to the drug. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Delayed suspicion of invasive infection by T inkin may result in a poor outcome in patients with severe forms of pemphigus. This opportunistic infection is highly refractory to conventional potent antifungal treatment.
