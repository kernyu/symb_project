We investigated the activity of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT) against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the pathogen that causes tuberculosis (TB). The MIC distribution of SXT was 0.125/2.4 to 2/38 mg/liter for the 100 isolates tested, including multi- and extensively drug-resistant isolates (MDR/XDR-TB), whereas the intracellular MIC90 of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) for the pansusceptible strain H37Rv was 76 mg/liter. In an exploratory analysis using a ratio of the unbound area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h over MIC (fAUC0-24/MIC) using >/= 25 as a potential target, the cumulative fraction response was >/= 90% at doses of >/= 2,400 mg of SMX. SXT is a potential treatment option for MDR/XDR-TB.
