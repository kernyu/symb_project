This study was conducted to detect the presence of heterogenous vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (heteroVISA) among MRSA isolates in a major hospital. Forty-three MRSA isolates with vancomycin MIC 2 microg/ml collected in 2009 was screened for heteroVISA using Etest Glycopeptide Resistance Detection (GRD) and confirmed by population analysis profile-area under curve method. The genetic relatedness of heteroVISA strains with other MRSA was examined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) method. Two isolates were shown to be heteroVISA and derived from the same clone. This showed that heteroVISA strains were already present among our local strains since 2009 and were genetically related to other susceptible strains.
