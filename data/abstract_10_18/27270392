The tetraprimer ARMS-PCR technique is efficient for SNP detection and can be used to search for polymorphisms associated with drug resistance. However, the establishment of this methodology is not always straightforward because of the constraints on primer design due to the restrictions of the polymorphic regions. Here, we describe the standardization of the tetraprimer ARMS-PCR methodology for the detection of a SNP at codon 198 of the Ancylostoma caninum beta-tubulin gene. This SNP is associated with resistance to albendazole in various nematodes. The methodology was used to screen 327 individuals from 6 different locations. No mutation was found in any of the samples. This methodology will be useful for screening for the E198A SNP in the beta-tubulin gene of canine hookworms in a broader population to determine whether this SNP is associated with benzimidazole resistance in this species. The method could also be adapted for the analysis of other SNPs in other nematode species.
