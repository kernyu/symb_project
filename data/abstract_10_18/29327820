This special article reports on two crucial issues discussed during a meeting. The first was the updated management of Helicobacter pylori infection. This was approached taking into account the recent European Guidelines, with a focus on novelties in treatment. In particular, considering the increasing H. pylori antibiotic resistance to clarithromycin, in countries with a high clarithromycin resistance rate the bismuth-containing quadruple therapies should be preferred. The new formulation, with bismuth, metronidazole, and tetracycline contained in a single capsule (three-in-one), has shown exciting results both in naive and in non-responder patients. Levofloxacin- and rifabutin-containing triple therapies should be proposed to patients who experienced H. pylori treatment failures. Another key message on H. pylori management was that, after one or more failures, standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing should be considered before prescribing a further treatment. The second issue concerned the novelties on dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota and its clinical consequences. Among the latter, the focus was on both constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) and microscopic colitis. Since the number of microorganisms inhabiting the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is estimated to be about 10 times higher than that of human cells, it is not surprising to foresee the clinical consequences of dysbiosis. However, to date the role of dysbiosis in IBS-C and in microscopic colitis is poorly known and major efforts are needed to understand if manipulating microbiota could improve the treatment of these and other diseases both within and outside the GI tract.
