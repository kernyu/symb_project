The present study was undertaken to understand the distribution and the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the uropathogens in the remote islands of India. Patients' demographical data, urine culture results, and resistance rates were analyzed and multidrug resistant isolates were characterized. Significant bacteriuria was found in 16 (17.7%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 8.47-23.53%) samples, which includes Escherichia coli 9 (56.3%); Klebsiella pneumoniae 3 (18.8%); Enterobacter sp. 2 (12.5%) and Proteus mirabilis 2 (12.5%). The uropathogens showed a wide resistance involving 3-21 drugs with 15 different resistance patterns. Among the 16 isolates, 13 (81.3%, 95% CI 62.13-100.37%) and 11 (68.8%, 95% CI 46.04-91.46%) isolates were resistant to fluoroquinolones and third generation cephalosporins, respectively. Multiple mutations were detected in quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR) of the fluoroquinolone resistant isolates and all third generation cephalosporin resistant isolates producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. A total of 7 (44%, 95% CI 17.02-70.98%) isolates was found to harbor plasmid mediated quinolone resistance determinants The present study reports for the first time the presence of the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM-1) gene in two isolates of P. mirabilis in these islands. Detection of multidrug resistant and NDM-1 producing isolates from cases of urinary tract infection in these remote islands lends support to the belief that the existence of these highly resistant strains is perhaps more widespread than previously thought and underscores the need for immediate implementation of antibiotic policy integrated with a continuous surveillance system. The study strengthens the need for a continuous surveillance system of antibiotic resistance in these remote Islands.
