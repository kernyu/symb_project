A recombinant Helicoverpa armigera nucleopolyhedrovirus (HearNPV), Ar1b-HearNPV, was constructed and identified as an improved bio-control agent of Helicoverpa armigera larvae. The HearNPV polyhedrin promoter was used to express the insect-specific neurotoxin gene, ar1b, which was originally isolated from the Australian funnel-web spider (Atrax robustus). RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis showed that both the ar1b transcript and protein were produced successfully in Ar1b-HearNPV-infected HzAM1 cells. In order to investigate the influence of foreign gene insertion in HearNPV, including the ar1b gene, chloramphenicol resistance gene, lacZ, kanamycin resistance gene, and the gentamicin resistance gene, two virus strains (HZ8-HearNPV and wt-HearNPV) were used as controls in the cell transfection analysis. As expected, foreign gene insertion had no impact on budded virus production and viral DNA replication. Both optical microscopy and electron microscopy observations indicated that the formation of the occlusion bodies of recombinant virus was similar to wild type virus. The Ar1b-HearNPV-infected H. armigera larvae exhibited paralysis and weight loss before dying. This recombinant virus also showed a 32.87% decrease in LT50 assays compared with the wild type virus. Besides, Ar1b-HearNPV also inhibited host larval growth and diet consumption. This inhibition was still significant in the older instar larvae treated with the recombinant virus. All of these positive properties of this novel recombinant HearNPV provide a further opportunity to develop this virus strain into a commercial product to control the cotton bollworm.
