Screening for circumventors of beta-lactam resistance in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) led us to find 17 novel antibiotics, naphthacemycins A1-A11, B1-B4 and C1-C2. The naphthacemycins were isolated from a cultured broth of Streptomyces sp. KB-3346-5 by repeated silica gel column chromatography and HPLC. Naphthacemycins enhanced imipenem activity 100-500 times against MRSA at 0.5 mug ml(-1), and naphthacemycins A4-A11 themselves showed MIC50 values of 1-4 mug ml(-1) against 22 MRSA strains.
