The development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria following introduction of antimicrobial agents has emerged as an important medical problem everywhere in the world including Bangladesh. Extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) are rapidly evolving group of beta-lactamase enzymes produced by the Gram negative bacteria. This study was undertaken to characterize ESBL producing gram negative bacilli from urine, skin wound (pus and wound infection). A total of 300 gram negative bacilli were screened for resistance to third generation Cephalosporins (3GCs) by disc diffusion test. The ESBL status was confirmed by double disc diffusion test (DDDT), minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) by agar dilution method as recommended by Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute 2010 (CLSI) and multiplex PCR for TEM, SHV and CTX-M, CTX-M-3, CTX-M-14 genes. The present study revealed a higher occurrence of multi drugs resistant ESBLs production among gram negative isolates where Klebsiella spp. were the leading bacteria 36/45 (80%), followed by Proteus spp. 40/55 (72.7%), Esch. coli 105/156 (67.3%) and others 25/35 (71.4 %). Rate of TEM, SHV and CTX-M genes present in study population were 50.46%, 18.69% and 46.72% respectively. Among the CTX-M positive genes CTX-M-3 and CTX-M-14 were 78.0% (39/50) and 80.0% (40/50) respectively. Results indicate that routine ESBL detection should be made mandatory and irrational use of third generation cephalosporins must be discouraged to reduce multi drugs resistance bacteria, to increase patients' compliance and to make an antibiotic policy.
