The Firmicutes constitute a phylum of bacteria that can be found in a wide variety of habitats, from soil to the gastrointestinal tract of animals, where they have to thrive in complex communities. Competition in these communities usually involves the production of compounds such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) to eliminate competitor organisms. Animals and plants also produce AMPs to control their associated microbiota. In turn, defence mechanisms have evolved to prevent the action of these compounds. The close association of some Firmicutes with humans as prominent pathogens or commensal organisms has driven a considerable research effort on defence mechanisms used by these bacteria against antimicrobial compounds. This review focuses on the most recent advances on two well-characterized defence mechanisms against AMPs: the modification of the cell wall by D-alanylation and the role of peptide antibiotic-specific adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporters.
