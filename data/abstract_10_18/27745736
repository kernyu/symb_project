We evaluated activity of apramycin, a non-ototoxic/non-nephrotoxic aminocyclitol against 141 clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates, 51% of which were non-susceptible to carbapenems (CRE). Among CRE, 70.8% were apramycin susceptible, which compared favorably to aminoglycosides in current clinical use. Our data suggest that apramycin deserves further investigation as a repurposed, anti-CRE therapeutic.
