PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The hepatitis C virus remains a global health issue, and the established standard of care has consisted of pegylated interferon alpha in conjunction with ribavirin. However, this regimen is associated with significant side-effects and poor sustained virological responses. The aim of this review is to assess the effects of the direct-acting antivirals upon hepatitis C genotypes 2-6 from publications from the past 18 months. RECENT FINDINGS: The impact of direct-acting antivirals has already substantially improved treatments for genotypes 2-6, with the size of improvement much less marked for genotype 3. Although still responsive to these agents, genotype 3 has inherent resistance to treatments possibly owing to its effects on host metabolic pathways. These treatments have moved sustained virological responses to the threshold of 90%, with reduced side-effects and shortened courses of treatment and some options for interferon-free therapy. These newer medications are transforming clinical guidelines at a rapid rate, but this will have to be balanced with the impact it places on global health budgets. SUMMARY: Although direct-acting antivirals are transforming the treatment of all hepatitis C genotypes, ongoing studies will optimize treatment duration and provide interferon-free alternatives.
