We report the use of antimicrobial hemolymph proteins from the model host Galleria mellonella as an inhibitor for various Listeria strains, providing a novel source for antilisterial therapeutics. We also have shown that specific virulence-associated genes known to mediate antimicrobial resistance of Listeria in mammalian models indicated a similar function in Galleria.
