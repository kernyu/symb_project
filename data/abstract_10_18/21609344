AIMS: We investigated the effectiveness in vitro of the association between norfloxacin (NOR) and ursolic acid (UA) against Staphylococcus aureus. METHODS AND RESULTS: The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), the minimal bactericidal concentrations, the bacterial killing and the postantibiotic effect (PAE) of NOR and UA were determined both singly and in combination. A synergistic interaction was observed against Staph. aureus ATCC 29213: the mean PAEs were 3 h for NOR, -1.2 h for UA (1 x MIC) and 2.0 h for UA (2 x MIC). Synergism was observed with longer PAEs and postantibiotic sub-MIC effects after NOR/UA exposure. UA was also active against clinical isolates and methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus. CONCLUSIONS: The application of antimicrobial combinations may address the rising resistance to established classes of both systemic and topical agents. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: In vitro interactions between NOR and UA may contribute to the development of novel topical agents for the treatment of skin infections as well as for topical formulations.
