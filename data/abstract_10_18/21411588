This study explored strain distribution and resistance patterns of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) over a 5-year period in northeastern Scotland. We noted a shift in the relative rates of epidemic strains and an increase in community-associated strains. Use of oral antibiotics to eradicate throat carriage may have contributed to trimethoprim resistance, which was observed to increase 10-fold.
