AIM: To study microbial spectrum of urethra and prostate secretions (PS) in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP) as well biological characteristics and pathogenicity factors of isolated staphylococci. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-five patients with CBP were examined. Fourty-six samples of PS, 28 samples of urethra secretions, and 153 strains of microorganisms were studied. Bacteriologic tests were performed using unified methods according to Ministry of Health order no. 535 (1985). Susceptibility to antibiotics was assessed according to methodic guidelines 4.2.1890-04 (2004). RESULTS: It was revealed that Gram-positive microorganisms, mostly Staphylococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp., were most frequently isolated from PS and urethra. Isolated microorganisms had secreting pathogenicity factors and were resistance to multiple antibiotics that could promote their persistence in prostate tissues and urethra. CONCLUSION: Gram-positive microflora possessing the range of pathogenicity factors, probably, maintain chronic inflammation in genitourinary system.
