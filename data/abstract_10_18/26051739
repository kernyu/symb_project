To investigate pathogen distribution and drug resistance of incision infection caused by vascular operation to reduce postoperative incision infection, this paper retrospectively reviewed and analyzed 635 in-hospital patients taking vascular operation during Jan. 2008 and Dec. 2012. Analyzed data were statistically processed by SPSS 13.0 software, which resulted in 16 infected cases with 2.52% infection rate. A total of 27 pathogens wasisolated from specimens submitted for inspection, including 17 strains of Gram positive bacteria (62.96%) and 10 Gram negative bacteria (37.04%). Besides high sensitivity to imipenem, all bacteria were able to resist antibacterial drugs. Incision infection is proved in this research to be reduced effectively by some means, like complication correction before operation and reasonable application of antibacterial drugs after operation. While during an operation, it is necessary to operate strictly in a bacterium-free environment and wash incisions thoroughly.
