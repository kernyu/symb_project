BACKGROUND: Ecthyma gangrenosum (EG) is an anatomoclinical syndrome commonly associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa cutaneous infection. Other microorganisms have also been incriminated on occasion, with other viral, fungal and bacterial agents potentially causing EG. In this report, we present an extremely rare case of an EG caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) infection. This case, highly characteristic of EG both clinically and histologically, calls into question the physiopathological mechanisms of the disease and provides a reminder that it may be caused by a variety of organisms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 62-year-old woman, followed for HIV seropositivity at the AIDS stage, developed a painful purpuric skin rash evolving towards necrotic nodules characteristic of ecthyma gangrenosum. Skin biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of EG due to methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) infection without toxins or bacteraemia. DISCUSSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case in the literature in which MSSA is reported as the underlying cause of such lesions.
