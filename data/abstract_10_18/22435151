Malaria still tops the prevalent human arthropod-borne diseases. In Egypt, sporadic cases of human malaria were reported with a focus in Al-Fayoum. Besides, many Egyptian Anopheles species were reported allover which are either malaria vectors or incriminated ones. This study recorded An. multicolor, An. sergentii, and An. algeriensis in Toshka. Many authors reported that A. sergentii is a malaria-vector and A. multicolor is a suspected vector. Consquently, the endemicity of Chloroquine resistant Plasmodium falciparum on the Egyptian-Sudanese border pave the way for malignant malaria transmission particularly among travelers returning back from Sudan.
