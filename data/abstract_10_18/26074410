Between 2011 and 2012, a total of 896 pig fecal samples were collected from nine provinces in Korea, and 50 salmonella enterica susp. enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) was isolated. The characteristics of the 50 strains were analyzed, and 4 strains were identified as Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar 4,[5],12:i:-. Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:- could not be distinguished from S. Typhimurium through phage typing, antimicrobial resistance testing or multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). However, among the four Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:- strains, one (KVCC-BA1400078) was identified as a Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:- clone isolated from humans in the United States, and another (KVCC-BA1400080) was identified as DT193, which has been primarily isolated from humans and animals in European countries. The presence of Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:- in Korea poses a significant threat of horizontal transfer between pigs and humans.
