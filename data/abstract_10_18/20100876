A Candida glabrata calcineurin mutant exhibited increased susceptibility to both azole antifungal and cell wall-damaging agents and was also attenuated in virulence. Although a mutant lacking the downstream transcription factor Crz1 displayed a cell wall-associated phenotype intermediate to that of the calcineurin mutant and was modestly attenuated in virulence, it did not show increased azole susceptibility. These results suggest that calcineurin regulates both Crz1-dependent and -independent pathways depending on the type of stress.
