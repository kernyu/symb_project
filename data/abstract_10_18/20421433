We investigated the proportion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates from pediatric patients demonstrating mupirocin resistance related to mupirocin use at our institution. No mupirocin resistance was found in 98% of isolates, whereas mupirocin prescriptions increased by 110%. Resistance rates remained low despite the increasing use of mupirocin.
