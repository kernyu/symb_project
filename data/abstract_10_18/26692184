BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The prevalence of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae in nursing home residents has rarely been reported in Taiwan. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed at medical wards of a district hospital at southern Taiwan between July 2009 and June 2011. Patients were included if they were older than 18 years, admitted via the emergency department, and their blood, sputum, or urine culture revealed the growth of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Proteus mirabilis. From each patient only the first isolate from the infection site was included. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using the disc diffusion method. RESULTS: Overall, 827 patients were included, with 354 (42.8%) coming from the community and 473 (57.2%) referred from a nursing home. Of the isolates acquired in nursing home, 45.5% (215/473) harbored ESBL. By contrast, 20.6% (73) of 354 isolates acquired in the community exhibited the ESBL production phenotype (p < 0.001). Of the isolates obtained from blood, urine, or sputum, 28.2% (37/131), 36.0% (208/578), or 36.4% (43/118) harbored ESBL, respectively, whereas 41% (211) of 515 E. coli isolates, 34.3% (72) of 210 K. pneumoniae, and 4.9% (5) of 102 P. mirabilis had ESBL. In general, the isolates from a nursing home or those with ESBL had lower antimicrobial susceptibility rates than those from the community or those without ESBL production. Only amikacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ertapenem, and imipenem/meropenem were active against >90% Enterobacteriaceae isolates, irrespective of ESBL production. CONCLUSION: ESBL production was common among clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates, especially E. coli or those isolated from nursing home residents.
