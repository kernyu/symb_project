To compare the incidence of infective complications after transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)-guided biopsy with either empirical fluoroquinolone or culture-based targeted antimicrobial prophylaxis, and the prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance (FQ-R) in men undergoing prostate biopsy. A systematic review of the literature was performed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We included studies of patients undergoing TRUS-guided biopsy that compared infective outcomes of those who received targeted antimicrobial therapy based on the results of pre-procedural rectal swab cultures, with those receiving empiric fluoroquinolone antimicrobial prophylaxis. The prevalence of FQ-R was recorded as a secondary outcome measure. Studies with no control group were excluded. From 125 studies screened, nine studies (4 571 patients) met the inclusion criteria. All studies were of cohort design, and included a combination of retrospective and prospective data. Six studies included were undertaken in North America. The remaining studies were undertaken in Spain, Turkey and Columbia. Within these studies, 2 484 (54.3%) patients received empirical fluoroquinolone prophylaxis, whilst 2 087 (45.7%) patients had pre-biopsy rectal swabs and targeted antibiotics. The mean FQ-R was 22.8%. Post-biopsy infection and sepsis rates were significantly higher in groups given empirical prophylaxis (4.55% and 2.21%) compared with groups receiving targeted antibiotics (0.72% and 0.48%). Based on these results 27 men would need to receive targeted antibiotics to prevent one infective complication. Our systematic review suggests that targeted prophylactic antimicrobial therapy before TRUS-guided prostate biopsy is associated with lower rates of sepsis. We therefore recommend changing current pathways to adopt this measure.
