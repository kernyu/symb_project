In this study, our aim was to show the antibiotic resistance patterns of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) strains isolated from patients who had undergone esophagogastroduodenoscopy at Hacettepe University. Ninety-three culturepositive patients with no history of H. pylori treatment were included in the study. MIC values against clarithromycin, metronidazole, amoxicillin and tetracycline were evaluated by gradient strips. In the 93 strains, no resistance against tetracycline and amoxicillin was observed. Clarithromycin resistance was detected in 28 (30.1%) and metronidazole resistance in 45 (48.4%) patients' strains. Resistance to clarithromycin and metronidazole, respectively, was observed in three age groups as follows: in 3 (17.6%) and 5 (29.4%) strains in the 5-9 age group; in 13 (30.9%) and 16 (38.1%) strains in the 10-14 age group; and in 12 (35.3%) and 24 (70.6%) strains in the 15-19 age group. Antibiotic susceptibility testing prior to treatment would prevent the administration of useless treatments. It is therefore recommended that such testing be performed before planning the treatment.
