INTRODUCTION: Microbiology and susceptibility of middle ear pathogens in children change over time and antibiotic resistance is increasing globally. For the clinicians it is important to be up to date about the resistance situation when considering antibiotic treatment in acute otitis media (AOM). In this study we analysed the resistance profile of AOM pathogens in out-patient children in Finland. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 41 culture positive middle ear fluid (MEF) samples were analysed for bacteria and the presence of antibiotic resistant strains. The samples were obtained from children aged six - 39 months who participated in the otitis media trial during one year period. RESULTS: The most common pathogen was Haemophilus influenzae 17 (40%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae in 15 (35%) and Moraxella catarrhalis in 8 (19%). Other pathogens were detected in 3 (7%) of cases. Antibiotic resistance or diminished sensitivity was seen in 63% of the detected bacteria and 28% of pathogens produced beta-lactamase. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic resistant bacterial strains causing AOM have increased in Finland. Nevertheless, most of the pathogens (72%) were sensitive to amoxicillin, which is still recommended as the first line antibiotic in the treatment of AOM.
