Acinetobacter baumannii are Gram-negative bacilli that pose a constant threat to susceptible patients because of increased resistance to multiple antibiotics and persistence in the hospital environment. After genome analysis, we discovered that A. baumannii harbors genes that share homology to an enzymatic pathway that elongates long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) in fungi. Previously, 1,2,4-triazolidine-3-thiones (T-3-Ts) were shown to inhibit hyphae production in fungi, and this same LCFA elongation pathway was implicated as the possible target. Therefore, we investigated if T-3-Ts also have activity against multidrug-resistant A. baumannii. Surprisingly, all of the clinical isolates of A. baumannii that were tested have susceptibility to ECC145 and ECC188 with MIC90 values of 8.0 mug/mL. In contrast, reference strains and clinical isolates of other common nosocomial bacteria that lack the LCFA pathway also lacked susceptibility. Time-kill experiments revealed that both ECC145 and ECC188 have a bacteriostatic effect against A. baumannii. Mass spectrometry analysis suggested that exposure to T-3-Ts resulted in less LCFA production. Supplementation of media with either 0.02% w/v oleic or linoleic acid abrogated the bacteriostatic effect of the compounds, which again implicated LCFA elongation as the target. Our results suggest these molecules could be a promising start to further exploit what appears to be an important aspect of A. baumannii membrane function and integrity.
