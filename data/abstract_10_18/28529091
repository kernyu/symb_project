Our aims were to identify factors associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) bloodstream infection (BSI) in patients with hematological malignancies and evaluate the outcome of the affected patients. Consecutive patients with hematological malignancies who developed PA BSI were identified. Subsequently, two case-control studies were performed to evaluate the risk factors (i) for PA BSI and (ii) for carbapenem resistant (CR) PA BSI. Patients' outcome was evaluated at 28 days after the onset of bacteraemia. A total of 64 patients with PA BSI (45 caused by CS and 19 by CR organisms) and 128 without PA BSI were enrolled. Patients with rapidly fatal disease, steroid use, neutropenia or prior surgery were more likely to develop PA BSI, whereas patients with previous hospitalization and prior use of fluoroquinolones were more likely to develop CR PA BSI. The 28-day mortality rate was 35.9%. Severity of sepsis was the only independent predictor of adverse outcome.
