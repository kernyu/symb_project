Genome shuffling is an efficient approach for the rapid engineering of microbial strains with desirable industrial phenotypes. In this study, a strategy of incorporating streptomycin resistance screening into genome shuffling (GS-SR) was applied for rapid improvement of doramectin production by Streptomyces avermitilis NEAU1069. The starting mutant population was generated through treatment of the spores with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, respectively, and five mutants with higher productivity of doramectin were selected as starting strains for GS-SR. Finally, a genetically stable strain F4-137 was obtained and characterized to be able to yield 992 +/- 4.4 mg/l doramectin in a shake flask, which was 7.3-fold and 11.2-fold higher than that of the starting strain UV-45 and initial strain NEAU1069, respectively. The doramectin yield by F4-137 in a 50-l fermentor reached 930.3 +/- 3.8 mg/l. Furthermore, the factors associated with the improved doramectin yield were investigated and the results suggested that mutations in ribosomal protein S12 and the enhanced production of cyclohexanecarboxylic coenzyme A may contribute to the improved performance of the shuffled strains. The random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis showed a genetic diversity among the shuffled strains, which confirmed the occurrence of genome shuffling. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that GS-SR is a powerful method for enhancing the production of secondary metabolites in Streptomyces.
