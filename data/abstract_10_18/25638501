In order to identify novel nonnucleoside inhibitors of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase two series of amide-containing uracil derivatives were designed as hybrids of two scaffolds of previously reported inhibitors. Subsequent biological evaluation confirmed acetamide uracil derivatives 15a-k as selective micromolar NNRTIs with a first generation-like resistance profile. Molecular modeling of the most active compounds 15c and 15i was employed to provide insight on their inhibitory properties and direct future design efforts.
