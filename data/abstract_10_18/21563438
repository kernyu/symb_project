Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most frequent diseases in young children and also the most common indication for antibiotic prescribing. It impose substantial burden on pediatricians and general practitioners and leads to negative sequelae and complications in developing countries. Because of growing resistance to antibiotics of respiratory tract pathogens, and the great tendency of AOM to spontaneous resolution there is need for reduction of antibiotic treatment in this disease. The pros and cons of this therapy are presented in this paper. Indications for surgical interventions--adenoidectomy and tympanostomy tubes insertion in cases of recurrent acute otitis media are also presented.
