The SINGLE study was a randomized, double-blind, noninferiority study that evaluated the safety and efficacy of 50 mg dolutegravir + abacavir/lamivudine versus efavirenz/tenofovir/emtricitabine in 833 ART-naive HIV-1 + participants. Of 833 randomized participants, 71% in the dolutegravir + abacavir/lamivudine arm and 63% in the efavirenz/tenofovir/emtricitabine arm maintained viral loads of <50 copies per milliliter through W144 (P = 0.01). Superior efficacy was primarily driven by fewer discontinuations due to adverse events in the dolutegravir + abacavir/lamivudine arm [dolutegravir + abacavir/lamivudine arm, 16 (4%); efavirenz/tenofovir/emtricitabine arm, 58 (14%)] through W144 [corrected]. No treatment-emergent integrase or nucleoside resistance was observed in dolutegravir + abacavir/lamivudine recipients through W144.
