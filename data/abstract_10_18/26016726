The US city of New Orleans was ranked second in the nation for estimated HIV case rates in 2011. Opt-out testing was established at the Interim Louisiana Hospital in New Orleans in 2013. The majority of new diagnoses were referred to the HIV outpatient program. We conducted a retrospective chart review of newly referred antiretroviral-naive patients establishing HIV care between January 2009 and June 2013 to characterise demographic and genotype profiles to assist in clinical management and needed services. Of the eligible 226 patients, 68% were men, and 88% were African American. Nearly half of the study patients were younger than 35 years of age. Forty-six percent had an initial CD4 count <200 cells/mm(3), and 39% had a HIV viral load >100,000 copies/mL. The antiretroviral class with the most common major mutation was the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) where K103N was the most common major NNRTI mutation at presentation. We observed that male patients showed more advanced disease with later presentation to care, confirming the need for earlier HIV diagnosis. When considering initial antiretroviral therapy, baseline genotype information is encouraged, particularly if considering a NNRTI-based regimen.
