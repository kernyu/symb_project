BACKGROUND: One of the major concerns of the biomedical community is the increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistant microorganisms. Recent findings show that the diversification of colony morphology may be indicative of the expression of virulence factors and increased resistance to antibiotic therapeutics. To transform these findings, and upcoming results, into a valuable clinical decision making tool, colony morphology characterisation should be standardised. Notably, it is important to establish the minimum experimental information necessary to contextualise the environment that originated the colony morphology, and describe the main morphological features associated unambiguously. RESULTS: This paper presents MorphoCol, a new ontology-based tool for the standardised, consistent and machine-interpretable description of the morphology of colonies formed by human pathogenic bacteria. The Colony Morphology Ontology (CMO) is the first controlled vocabulary addressing the specificities of the morphology of clinically significant bacteria, whereas the MorphoCol publicly Web-accessible knowledgebase is an end-user means to search and compare CMO annotated colony morphotypes. Its ultimate aim is to help correlate the morphological alterations manifested by colony-forming bacteria during infection with their response to the antimicrobial treatments administered. CONCLUSIONS: MorphoCol is the first tool to address bacterial colony morphotyping systematically and deliver a free of charge resource to the community. Hopefully, it may introduce interesting features of analysis on pathogenic behaviour and play a significant role in clinical decision making. DATABASE URL: http://morphocol.org.
