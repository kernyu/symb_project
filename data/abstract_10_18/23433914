Bacterial culture remains the gold standard for symptomatic infection. Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAATs) have better sensitivity and specificity for rectal and pharyngeal specimens. A bacterial culture with antibiogram must be done for all NAAT positive specimens in order to modify antibiotics prescription if needed. We must fear a diffusion of extensively drug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae in the future. Nevertheless, ceftriaxone 500 mg intramuscular with 1 g of azithromycin against Chlamydia trachomatis remains the treatment of N. gonorrhoeae infections. Screening of partners of identified cases and other STDs is the main measure to add to the treatment of gonorrhea.
