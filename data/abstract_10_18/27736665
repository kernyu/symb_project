Human noroviruses are the leading cause of foodborne illness causing both acute and chronic gastroenteritis.

We here discuss aspects of norovirus genetic evolution, persistence in immunocompromised patients as well as the risk and potential consequences of resistance development toward future antiviral drugs.
