In tropical and subtropical regions of the world, parasitic diseases are major obstacle in the health and ultimately overall performance of animals. Cattle express heritable, contrasting phenotypes when exposed to ticks depicting genetic nature of trait. IFN-gamma is one of the most reported genes critical for innate and adaptive immunity against viral and intracellular infections. To identify its role in resistance for ectoparasite especially tick, genetic characterization of this gene was done in resistant and susceptible animals of Sahiwal cattle (n = 95) and Friesian (n = 92). Nine Polymorphisms were identified, three of them were found in exonic region. One out of nine variants was being reported previously (ss82716193) and was confirmed in Pakistani Sahiwal cattle population as well. Single site analysis of each variant depicted their significance in tick resistant and tick susceptible groups (P < 0.05). The associations using haplotypes were more informative than for single markers. Eighteen different haplotypes resulting from nine polymorphic sites were used in construction of maximum parsimony tree which categorized resistant and susceptible animals in two clades. Genetic markers identified in this study can be useful in future breeding selection programs against tick resistance.
