AIM: Data on antimicrobial resistance in uropathogens in infants up to the age of three months are limited. This study characterised resistance patterns in Gram-negative uropathogens in infants up to the age of two months. METHODS: Previously healthy young infants with urinary tract infections (UTIs) were studied retrospectively. Antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated. Multidrug resistance (MDR) was defined as resistance to at least three antibiotic classes. Clinical, laboratory and outcome data were compared between infants with UTIs caused by bacteria sensitive and resistant to empirical and to oral therapy. RESULTS: We evaluated 306 UTI episodes with 314 pathogens. The following resistance rates were observed: ampicillin 73.7%, cefazoline 22.1%, ampicillin/clavulanate 21.8%, cefuroxime 7.8%, gentamicin 7%; MDR 11.8%; resistant to empirical treatment 7.3% and resistant to available oral antibiotics 8.6%. Our study showed that pathogens resistant to empirical and oral therapy were more frequently isolated in non-Jewish (Arab) infants and in those of >/=30 days of age. Resistance to empirical treatment and oral antibiotics also resulted in longer mean hospital stays. CONCLUSION: Resistance to antibiotics challenges empirical therapy and compromises oral treatment options in young infants with UTIs. Antimicrobial resistance patterns should be monitored in infants to determine appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy protocols.
