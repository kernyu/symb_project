OBJECTIVE: Biofilm of Candida tropicalis denote as a complex cellular congregation with major implication in pathogenesis. This lifestyle of fungus as a biofilm can inhibit immune system and antifungal therapy in treatment of infectious disease especially medical device associated chronic disease. In this study effects of Zinc Oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles and EDTA were evaluated on C. tropicalis biofilm by using different techniques. ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized from Egg albumin. DESIGN: To assay the formation of biofilm of yeast cells like Fluconazole-susceptible C. tropicalis (ATCC 13,803) and fluconazole-resistant standard strains of C. tropicalis (ATCC 750) were grown in 24 well plates and antifungal effect of ZnO and EDTA were evaluated on C. tropicalis biofilm using ATP bioluminescence and tetrasodium salt (XTT) reduction assays. RESULTS: Synthesized ZnO NPs and EDTA had effective antifungal properties at the concentration of 5.2, 8.6mug/ml for Fluconazole susceptible strain and 5.42, 10.8mug/ml Fluconazole resistant strains of C. tropicalis biofilms compared to fluconazole drug. CONCLUSION: In present study we conclude, ZnO considered as a new agent in field of prevention C. tropicalis biofilms especially biofilms formed surface of medical device.
