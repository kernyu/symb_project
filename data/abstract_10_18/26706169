Juglone 1 an plumbagin 2 are plant secondary metabolites nowadays well known for their anticancer properties. In this study we synthesized analogues of 1 and 2 deriving from the functionalization of the OH group in position 5 with different side chains in form of esters and ethers. Therefore the growth inhibitory activities of these adducts were evaluated in vitro on six cancer cell lines using the MTT colorimetric assays along with the two natural parent compounds. The data revealed that these latter displayed the strongest growth inhibitory activities in vitro. Quantitative videomicroscopy analyses were then carried out on human U373 glioblastoma cells, which are characterized by various level of resistance to pro-apoptotic stimuli. We compared the naturally occurring reference compounds 1 and 2 with the derivatives exerting the best activities in terms of IC50 growth inhibitory values. These analyses showed that both juglone and plumbagin had a cytostatic effect on U373 cells and were able to overcome the intrinsic resistance of U373 cancer cells to pro-apoptotic stimuli.
