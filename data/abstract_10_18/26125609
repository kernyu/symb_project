Successful application of gene therapy strategies may require stringently regulated transgene expression. Along this line, we describe a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible 'all-in-one' lentiviral vector design using the pTET-T11 (TII) minimal-promoter and a reverse transactivator protein (rtTA2S-M2) driven by the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter allowing for tight regulation of transgene expression (Lv.TII vectors). Vector design was evaluated in human hematopoietic cells in the context of cytidine deaminase (hCDD)-based myeloprotective gene therapy. Upon Dox administration, a rapid (16-24 h) and dose-dependent (>0.04 mug ml(-1) Dox) onset of transgene expression was detected in Lv.TII.CDD gene-modified K562 cells as well as in primary human CD34(+) hematopoietic cells. Importantly, in both cell models low background transgene expression was observed in the absence of Dox. Functionality of Dox-inducible hCDD expression was demonstrated by >10-fold increase in cytosine arabinoside (1-beta-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine, Ara-C) resistance of Lv.TII.CDD-transduced K562 cells. In addition, Lv.TII.CDD-transduced CD34(+)-derived myeloid cells were protected from up to 300 nm Ara-C (control affected from 50 nm onwards). These data clearly demonstrate the suitability of our self-inactivating lentiviral vector to induce robust, tightly regulated transgene expression in human hematopoietic cells with minimal background activity and highlight the potential of our construct in myeloprotective gene therapy strategies.
