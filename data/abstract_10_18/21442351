The control of grapevine pathogens is a rising concern in Vitis vinifera culture. The current international trend is toward banning chemicals that are highly toxic to the environment and human workers, and adopting tighter regulations. We evaluated the impact of saponins on three kinds of organisms found in grapevine culture. The ectoparasitic nematode Xiphinema index, the parasitic fungus Botrytis cinerea and various yeast strains representative of the must fermentation population were incubated on synthetic media supplemented with variable concentrations of Quillaja saponaria saponins. Saponins induced reduction in the growth of B. cinerea and showed nematicide effects on X. index. The control of X. index and Botrytis cinerea is discussed in the context of the potential use of these chemicals as environmentally-friendly grapevine treatments. With Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other yeasts, saponins showed higher toxicity against S. cerevisiae strains isolated from wine or palm wine whereas laboratory strains or strains isolated from oak exhibited better resistance. This indicates that Q. saponaria saponins effects against yeast microflora should be assessed in the field before they can be considered an environmentally-safe new molecule against B. cinerea and X. index.
