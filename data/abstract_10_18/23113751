BACKGROUND: Infection caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of mortality in children worldwide. The aim of this study was to determine if a noted increase in non-susceptibility to penicillin among pneumococcal clinical isolates from young children reflected a similar increase in healthy children. METHODS: During 2004-2005, before the conjugate pneumococcal vaccine was introduced in Sweden, 663 healthy children (13-24 months of age) attending 17 child health centres in Gothenburg, Sweden, were cultured for bacteria in the nasopharynx. Social factors were identified through a parental questionnaire. Pneumococcal serotypes and antibiotic resistance rates were determined. Antibiotic resistance was also monitored in 162 simultaneously obtained nasopharyngeal pneumococci isolated from clinical samples. RESULTS: The healthy children frequently carried pneumococci (45%), Moraxella catarrhalis (54%), and Haemophilus influenzae (22%). The carriage rates for all these pathogens were higher in children attending day care centres compared to children staying at home (p < 0.001). The dominating pneumococcal serotypes were 6B, 19F, 23F, and 6A. Non-susceptibility to penicillin was low (4.0%) and only exceeded by that to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (9.8%). Both rates were higher in the clinical isolates (9.3% and 16.7%, respectively; p < 0.05). No relationships to geographic area, day care attendance, recent antibiotic use, or travel abroad were shown for any specific serotype or for the presence of penicillin-non-susceptible pneumococci in the healthy children. CONCLUSIONS: Pneumococcal resistance rates in the healthy child population were low and did not reflect the higher rates noted at the laboratory in clinical samples obtained before and during the study.
