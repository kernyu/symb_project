Microbial infections still remain one of the main issues for human health. The rapid development of resistance towards the most common antimicrobial drugs in bacteria represents today a challenge in the infections management. In the present work we have investigated the antibacterial activity of a group of compounds, namely silver N-heterocyclic carbene complexes, against a broad spectrum of bacteria. For the most promising compound, a biopolymeric nanocarrier has been developed, in order to potentiate the metal complex activity against both Gram +ve and Gram -ve. The polymeric nanovehicle is based on dextran, modified with oleic acid residues, that confer amphiphilic properties to the polysaccharide. We have characterized the obtained biomaterial and studied its ability to self-assemble into nanoparticles in aqueous environment. Next, the transdermal diffusion analyses have been carried out to evaluate the ability of the polymeric particles to penetrate tissues. Thanks to the strategy adopted, we have fabricated an antibacterial system to which K. pneumoniae and E. coli are the most sensitive.
