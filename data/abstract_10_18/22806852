Exogenous plasmid isolation method was used to assess conjugative plasmids conferring pesticide tolerance/multiple metal and antibiotic resistance from contaminated soil using bacteria detached from soil samples as a donor and rifampicin resistant E. coli HMS as a recipient strain on mineral salt agar medium supplemented with gamma-HCH, and antibiotics ampicillin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and kanamycin. Transconjugants were obtained on ampicillin (10 mug/ml) and tetracycline (20 mug/ml) amended MSA plates and frequency of ampicillin and tetracycline resistance gene transfer was 7.2 x 10(-6) and 9.2 x 10(-4) transconjugants/recipient, respectively. PCR typing methods were used to assess the presence of plasmids of the incompatibility groups IncP, IncN, IncW, IncQ and rolling circle plasmids of pMV158 type in DNA derived from transconjugants. All transconjugants were PCR amplified for the detection of Inc group plasmids and rolling circle plasmids of pMV158 family in which TM2, 3, 4, 11 and 12 (tet) transconjugants gave PCR products with the IncP-specific primers for both replication and transfer functions (trfA2 (IncP) and oriT (IncP)), while TM 14 (amp) gave an IncP specific PCR product for the replication gene trfA2 (IncP) only. TM15, 16, 18 and 21 (amp) gave a PCR product for the IncW-specific oriT (IncW). Out of 24 transconjugants, only TM 5 (tet) gave a PCR product with the pMV158 specific primer pair for oriT (RC). Our findings indicate that Inc group plasmids and rolling circle plasmids of pMV158 type may be responsible for transferring multiple antibiotic resistance genes among the bacterial soil community.
