Alcaligenes sp. HPC 1271 demonstrated antibacterial activity against multidrug resistant bacteria, Enterobacter sp., resistant to sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, azithromycin, and tetracycline, as well as against Serratia sp. GMX1, resistant to the same antibiotics with the addition of netilmicin. The cell-free culture supernatant was analyzed for possible antibacterials by HPLC, and the active fraction was further identified by LC-MS. Results suggest the production of tunicamycin, a nucleoside antibiotic. The draft genome of this bacterial isolate was analyzed, and the 4.2 Mb sequence data revealed six secondary metabolite-producing clusters, identified using antiSMASH platform as ectoine, butyrolactone, phosphonate, terpene, polyketides, and nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS). Additionally, the draft genome demonstrated homology to the tunicamycin-producing gene cluster and also defined 30 ORFs linked to protein secretion that could also play a role in the antibacterial activity observed. Gene expression analysis demonstrated that both NRPS and dTDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase gene clusters are functional and could be involved in antibacterial biosynthesis.
