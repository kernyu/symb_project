Recent studies have shown that the pharmacodynamic (PD) index driving the efficacy of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations such as ceftazidime/avibactam and ceftolozane/tazobactam is the percentage of time the free inhibitor concentration is above a threshold (fT>threshold). However, data with piperacillin/tazobactam (TZP) are scarce. Here we aimed to assess the relationship between fT>threshold and TZP antibacterial efficacy by a population pharmacokinetic study in mice and dose-effect experiments in a neutropenic murine thigh infection model with two isogenic strains of Escherichia coli differentially expressing TEM-1 beta-lactamase. We also explored the dynamics of resistance selection with the innovator and a non-equivalent generic, extrapolated the results to the clinic by Monte Carlo simulation of standard TZP doses, and estimated the economic impact of generic-selected resistance. The fT>threshold index described well the efficacy of TZP versus E. coli, with threshold values from 0.5 mg/L to 2 mg/L and mean exposures of 42% for stasis and 56% for 1 log10 kill. The non-equivalent generic required a longer exposure (fT>threshold 33%) to suppress resistance compared with the innovator (fT>threshold 22%), leading to a higher frequency of resistance selection in the clinical simulation (16% of patients with the generic vs. 1% with the innovator). Finally, we estimated that use of TZP generics in a scenario of 25% therapeutic non-equivalence would result in extra expenses approaching US$1 billion per year in the USA owing to selection of resistant micro-organisms, greatly offsetting the savings gained from generic substitution and further emphasising the need for demonstrated and not assumed therapeutic equivalence.
