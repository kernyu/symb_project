The effect of erythrosine- and LED-mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) on planktonic cultures and biofilms of Candida albicans and Candida dubliniensis was evaluated. Planktonic cultures of standardized suspensions (10(6)cells/mL) of C. albicans and C. dubliniensis were treated with erythrosine concentrations of 0.39-200 muM and LEDs in a 96-well microtiter plate. Biofilms formed by C. albicans and C. dubliniensis in the bottom of a 96-well microtiter plate were treated with 400 muM erythrosine and LEDs. After PDT, the biofilms were analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The antimicrobial effect of PDT against planktonic cultures and biofilms was verified by counting colony-forming units (CFU/mL), and the data were submitted to analysis of variance and the Tukey test (P<0.05). C. albicans and C. dubliniensis were not detectable after PDT of planktonic cultures with erythrosine concentrations of 3.12 muM or higher. The CFU/mL values obtained from biofilms were reduced 0.74 log(10) for C. albicans and 0.21 log(10) for C. dubliniensis. SEM revealed a decrease in the quantity of yeasts and hyphae in the biofilm after PDT. In conclusion, C. albicans and C. dubliniensis were susceptible to erythrosine- and LED-mediated PDT, but the biofilms of both Candida species were more resistant than their planktonic counterparts.
