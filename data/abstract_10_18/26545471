BACKGROUND: The London Borough of Newham has the highest rates of tuberculosis (TB) within Europe (116 per 100,000). There is a lack of guidance in lymph node (LN) TB on how to best obtain a positive culture, which is the gold standard in the face of increasing mycobacterial resistance. METHODS: An individual cohort study was carried out via a prospective local TB database capturing 90 cases of cervical LN TB over 34 months. We compared the diagnostic efficacy of fine needle aspiration (FNA) and excision biopsy of LN. RESULTS: FNA cytology revealed granulomata in 49%, acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in 8.6% and a positive culture in 40%. LN excision showed granulomata in 97.6%, AFB in 17.1% and a positive culture in 70.1%. There was an 18% resistance to first-line antimicrobials. CONCLUSIONS: We describe our experience and suggest an algorithm for the culture of TB organisms to avoid a lengthy diagnostic process.
