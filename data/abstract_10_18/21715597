High-mannose N-linked glycans recognized by carbohydrate-binding agents (CBAs) are potential targets for topical microbicides. To better understand the mechanisms by which CBAs inhibit human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection at the molecular level, we systematically analysed the contribution of site-specific glycans to the anti-HIV activity of CBAs by site-directed mutagenesis. Our results demonstrate that a single deglycosylation at N295 or N448 in a range of primary and T-cell-line-adapted HIV-1 isolates resulted in marked resistance to griffithsin (GRFT) but maintained the sensitivity to cyanovirin (CV-N), Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) and a range of neutralizing antibodies. Unlike CV-N and GNA, the interaction between GRFT and gp120 appeared to be dependent on the specific trimeric 'sugar tower' including N295 and N448. This was further strengthened by the results of GRFT-Env binding experiments. Our study identifies GRFT-specific gp120 glycans and may provide information for the design of novel CBA antiviral strategies.
