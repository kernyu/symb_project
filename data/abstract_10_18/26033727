Release of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (endotoxin) from bacteria into the bloodstream may cause serious unwanted stimulation of the host immune system. Some but not all antimicrobial peptides can neutralize LPS-stimulated proinflammatory responses. Salt resistance and serum stability of short antimicrobial peptides can be boosted by adding beta-naphthylalanine to their termini. Herein, significant antiendotoxin effects were observed in vitro and in vivo with the beta-naphthylalanine end-tagged variants of the short antimicrobial peptides S1 and KWWK.
