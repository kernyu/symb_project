A parasite is a living organism that receives some of its basic nutritional requirements through intimate contact with another living organism. When the parasite reaches the eye, ocular complications occur due to mechanical, immunologic, or allergic reactions. When an ophthalmologist detects a parasite in the eye, it is often difficult to identify the exact organism. Lack of methodological uniformity in management of ocular parasitosis emphasizes the need for standardization, including construction of a management algorithm. Knowledge on immunoreactivity in systemic parasitology has grown remarkably, but translational research from bench to bedside needs to be improved. Newer molecular diagnostic techniques are essential for ophthalmic application. Many parasitic worms are developing resistance to available drugs, necessitating discovery of the next generation of anti-parasitic agents. The aim of this review is to understand the existing literature on ocular parasitosis, to highlight diagnostic and therapeutic advances, and to analyze the management algorithm on ocular parasitosis.
