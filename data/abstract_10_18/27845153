OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the association between previous daptomycin exposure and daptomycin non-susceptible Enterococcus faecium (DNSEf) bloodstream infections (BSI) in adult leukemia patients. METHODS: We retrospectively identified adult (>/=18 years old) leukemia patients with Enterococcus spp. bacteremia at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) from 6/1/2013 to 7/22/2015. Antimicrobial susceptibility and previous antibiotic exposure within the 90 days prior to bacteremia were collected. Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis was used to identify the most significant breakpoint between daptomycin exposure and DNSEf. RESULTS: Any amount of daptomycin received within the 90 days preceding BSI was significantly associated with isolation of DNSEf compared to daptomycin susceptible E. faecium (DSEf) (88% vs. 44%, respectively, p < 0.01). CART analysis identified receiving >/=13 days of daptomycin in the preceding 90 days as most significantly correlated with DNSEf (60% vs. 11%, relative risk [RR] 5.31, 95% Confidence interval [CI] 2.36-11.96, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Prior daptomycin exposure for >/=13 days within 90 days preceding BSI was significantly associated with isolation of DNSEf BSI in adult leukemia patients at our institution. Antimicrobial stewardship initiatives aimed at minimizing daptomycin exposure in high-risk patients may be of significant benefit in limiting the emergence of DNSEf.
