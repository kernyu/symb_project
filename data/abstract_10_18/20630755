N-substituted-3-carboxamido-coumarin derivatives were prepared and evaluated for selective antibacterial activity against 20 isolates of Helicobacter pylori clinical strains, including five metronidazole resistant ones. Some of them possessed the best activity against H. pylori metronidazole resistant strains with MIC values lower than the drug reference (metronidazole). Furthermore, anti-inflammatory activity through the inhibition of the IL-8 production was investigated.
