BACKGROUND: A patient diagnosed to have pneumonia and put on empirical antibiotics but did not show the expected resolution is a common problem faced by the clinician. AIM OF STUDY: (1) To find out the etiology and clinical outcome of nonresolving pneumonia in a tertiary care centre, (2) To find out the co-morbid conditions associated with nonresolution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 70 patients who did not show expected resolution after two weeks of adequate antibiotics were investigated systematically to find out the possible cause for non resolution and the associated co-morbid conditions. RESULTS: Tuberculosis was the commonest cause of nonresolving pneumonia (35.7%), followed by malignancy (27.1%), Bronchiectasis (8.6%), Pneumocystis pneumonia (7.1%),BOOP (5.7%) and Resistance to antibiotics (14.3%). Co-morbidities like COPD, diabetes, alcoholism, smoking and immunosuppression are significant factors causing nonresolution. CONCLUSION: This study stresses the need for a systematic approach to find out the etiology and properly manage nonresolving pneumonias.
