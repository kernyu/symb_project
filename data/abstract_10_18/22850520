Many successful antimicrobial drugs originate from synthetic dyes. This paper reports the in vitro activity of 14 fluorescent dyes against Plasmodium falciparum. Five of these dyes (Hoechst 33342, MitoRed, DiOC(6), SYTO 9, and rhodamine B) show activity at a low nanomolar concentration against two P. falciparum strains in the histidine-rich protein 2 drug sensitivity assay, while toxicity in HeLa cells is low. These dyes may be a starting point for developing new drugs against P. falciparum.
