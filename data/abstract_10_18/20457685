OBJECTIVE: The goal was to compare the frequency of children's antibiotic intake, emphasizing antibiotics with anti-Helicobacter pylori effects, in El Paso, Texas, and Juarez, Mexico. METHODS: Hispanic children were enrolled prenatally at mother-child clinics in El Paso, and Juarez, in 1998-2000, to identify determinants of H pylori infection. During follow-up examinations targeted every 6 months from 6 to 84 months of age, caretakers reported medication use during the preceding interval. Courses of any systemic and H pylori-effective antibiotics were compared for US and Mexican children. RESULTS: Antibiotic data were available for 602 children, from 2938 follow-up visits. Overall antibiotic intake was higher in Juarez, where 84% of children received > or = 1 course during the follow-up period (52% of visits), compared with El Paso, where 76% of children received > or = 1 course (40% of visits). In contrast, the intake of H pylori-effective antibiotics was higher in El Paso, where 65% of children received > or = 1 course during the follow-up period (27% of visits), compared with Juarez, where 44% of children received > or = 1 course (16% of visits). Of H pylori-effective courses, 94% contained amoxicillin and 2% each clarithromycin, metronidazole, and furazolidone; uses were primarily for throat and ear infections, diarrhea, and cold/flu. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric antibiotic use was higher in Mexico than on the US side of the border. Apparent misuse of H pylori-effective antibiotics was more frequent in Juarez but also occurred in El Paso. Such misuse of antibiotics may lead to drug resistance and may impair the control of H pylori infection in this region.
