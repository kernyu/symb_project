PURPOSE: We have previously reported that tyrosol (TYR) promotes lifespan extension in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, also inducing a stronger resistance to thermal and oxidative stress in vivo. In this study, we performed a whole-genome DNA microarray in order to narrow down the search for candidate genes or signaling pathways potentially involved in TYR effects on C. elegans longevity. METHODS: Nematodes were treated with 0 or 250 muM TYR, total RNA was isolated at the adult stage, and derived cDNA probes were hybridized to Affymetrix C. elegans expression arrays. Microarray data analysis was performed, and relative mRNA expression of selected genes was validated using qPCR. RESULTS: Microarray analysis identified 208 differentially expressed genes (206 over-expressed and two under-expressed) when comparing TYR-treated nematodes with vehicle-treated controls. Many of these genes are linked to processes such as regulation of growth, transcription, reproduction, lipid metabolism and body morphogenesis. Moreover, we detected an interesting overlap between the expression pattern elicited by TYR and those induced by other dietary polyphenols known to extend lifespan in C. elegans, such as quercetin and tannic acid. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that important cellular mechanisms directly related to longevity are influenced by TYR treatment in C. elegans, supporting our previous notion that this phenol might act on conserved genetic pathways to increase lifespan in a whole organism.
