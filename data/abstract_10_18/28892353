Options for influenza therapy are currently limited to one class of drug, the neuraminidase inhibitors. Amidst concerns about drug resistance, much effort has been placed on the discovery of new drugs with distinct targets and mechanisms of action, with great success. There are now several candidates in late stage development which include small molecules targeting the three subunits of the viral polymerase complex and monoclonal antibodies targeting the hemagglutinin, as well as host-directed therapies. The availability of drugs with diverse mechanisms now opens the door to exploring combination therapies for influenza, and the range of administration routes presents more opportunities for treating hospitalized patients.
