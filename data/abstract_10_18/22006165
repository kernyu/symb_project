INTRODUCTION: The changing antimicrobial sensitivity pattern of causative organisms poses a therapeutic challenge in treating patients with acute cholangitis. We therefore evaluated the microbial profile and sensitivity pattern to antibiotics in patients with acute bacterial cholangitis. METHODS: Data of patients above 18 years of age with acute bacterial cholangitis seen between January 2004 and March 2007 were retrospectively analyzed. The study was continued prospectively from April 2007 to December 2008. Data on clinical features, etiological and microbial profile and therapy, and patient outcomes were analyzed. In the prospective group, the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of organisms grown on bile and blood culture were also obtained. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-five patients with acute cholangitis were studied. Choledocholithiasis (62.7%) and malignancy (29.2%) were the main predisposing factors. Bile culture was positive in 88 of 95 patients, and blood culture was positive in 47 of 178 (26.4%) patients. Bile cultures were predominantly polymicrobial (69.5%) in contrast to blood cultures (2.2%). E. coli was the predominant isolate in blood and bile. No growth was seen on anaerobic bile or blood cultures. The prospective group showed high resistance of E. coli to third generation cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: Changing antimicrobial sensitivity patterns requires a revision of empiric antibiotic therapy policy in cholangitis.
