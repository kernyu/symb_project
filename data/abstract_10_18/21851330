BACKGROUND: In highly antiretroviral-experienced patients with a multidrug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, recommended regimens should preferentially contain 3 active components, including a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI/r). Tipranavir/r (TPV/r), a non-peptidic PI, has been specifically developed for patients resistant to the usual antiretroviral classes including PIs. This paper discusses the role of TPV/r in patients experiencing multiple PI resistance. METHODS: Virological, immunological, and safety outcomes were collected between 2003 and 2007 at 7 clinical units. Virus resistance assessment was based on 3 different genotypic tests. The 207 patients evaluated had previously received nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and PIs. RESULTS: The main drugs co-administered with TPV/r were 1 or 2 NRTIs associated, in half of the patients, with enfuvirtide. After 12 weeks, viral load was <50 copies/ml in 38% of the patients (44% with enfuvirtide), while median CD4 counts had increased from 150 to 250 cells/mm(3). Genotypic testing suggested that most of the patients had viruses susceptible to TPV. Lipid and transaminase levels were slightly modified, and less than 10% of treatment discontinuations were due to gastrointestinal events. CONCLUSION: A regimen including TPV/r associated with at least 1 active component is a valuable option in highly ARV-experienced patients with multi-resistance to the usual ARV classes including PIs.
