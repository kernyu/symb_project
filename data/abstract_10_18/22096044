Ritonavir-boosted tipranavir (TPV/r) and darunavir (DRV/r) have been approved in patients with virological resistance to multiple protease inhibitors (PIs). Whether the HIV-1 from these patients with virological failure to first-generation PIs remains susceptible to TPV/r or DRV/r is questionable. The susceptibilities of HIV-1 isolates to second-generation PIs in patients who experienced virological failure in three time periods were analysed: 9-2006 to 4-2007 (period 1), 5-2007 to 12-2007 (period 2) and 1-2008 to 8-2008 (period 3). A total of 53 subjects were enrolled, and 51 subject isolates (96.2%) were resistant to >/=1 PIs. The mutation scores for TPV and DRV, and the percentage of isolates with resistance to TPV or DRV, increased significantly from period 1 to period 3. Our data revealed a significant increase in the levels of genotypic resistance to TPV and DRV over the past two years in patients with virological failure to first-generation PIs.
