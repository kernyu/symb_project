Biofilm formation, a virulence factor of Acinetobacter baumannii, is associated with long-term survival in hospital environments and provides resistance to antibiotics. Standard tests for antibiotic susceptibility involve analyzing bacteria in the planktonic state. However, the biofilm formation ability can influence antibiotic susceptibility. Therefore, here, the biofilm formation ability of A. baumannii clinical isolates from Korea was investigated and the susceptibility of biofilm and planktonic bacteria to colistin was compared. Of the 100 clinical isolates examined, 77% exhibited enhanced biofilm formation capacity relative to a standard A. baumannii strain (ATCC 19606). Differences between the minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal biofilm-inhibitory concentrations of colistin were significantly greater in the group of A. baumannii that exhibited enhanced biofilm formation than the group that exhibited less ability for biofilm formation. Thus, the ability to form a biofilm may affect antibiotic susceptibility and clinical failure, even when the dose administered is in the susceptible range.
