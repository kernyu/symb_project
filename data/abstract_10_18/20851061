Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) bacteria are opportunistic respiratory pathogens which are particularly difficult to eradicate from the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients because of their innate resistance to antimicrobials and their capacity to form biofilms. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities of temocillin against planktonic and sessile Bcc bacteria. 37 strains belonging to 17 Bcc species were tested. 75.7% of the strains were susceptible when grown planktonically (minimal inhibitory concentration <16 mug/ml). The minimal bactericidal concentrations were higher than 128 mug/ml for most strains. No remarkable differences in resistance between exponentially growing planktonic cells and 4 h old biofilms were observed: when grown in a biofilm, 59.5% of the strains were susceptible. After treating 24 h biofilms with a concentration of 10xMIC, only a minor reduction was seen in the number of sessile cells, indicating a limited bactericidal activity against biofilms. Our data indicate that temocillin has a good bacteriostatic in vitro activity against planktonic and 4 h old biofilms, but seems of limited use to eradicate 24 h old biofilms.
