The impact of different mutations in the Aspergillus fumigatus ergosterol biosynthesis pathway on pathogenesis has been evaluated using a simple invertebrate mini host, the caterpillar Galleria mellonella. A set of strains that includes clinical isolates and isogenic mutants with mutations at the cyp51A gene conferring azole resistance were studied. All strains demonstrated a similar in vitro growth pattern and are equally virulent against the insect larvae. These results suggest that in A. fumigatus acquisition of this particular azole-resistance mechanism would not imply any significant change in virulence. G. mellonella may provide a convenient and inexpensive model for the in vivo prescreening of mutants of A. fumigatus, contributing to the generation of a hypotheses that can be further tested in refined experiments in mammalian models.
