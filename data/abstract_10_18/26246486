We evaluated the performance of the molecular lab-on-chip-based VerePLEX Biosystem for detection of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), obtaining a diagnostic accuracy of more than 97.8% compared to sequencing and MTBDRplus assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and rifampin and isoniazid resistance detection on clinical isolates and smear-positive specimens. The speed, user-friendly interface, and versatility make it suitable for routine laboratory use.
