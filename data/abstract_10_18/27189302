Scrub typhus is a zoonosis caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi (O. tsutsugamushi) occurring mainly in autumn in Korea. The need of new antibiotics has arisen with a report on strains resistant to antibiotics and chronic infection. This study aims to identify susceptibility of tigecycline in-vitro as a new therapeutic option for O. tsutsugamushi. Antibacterial activity of tigecycline against the O. tsutsugamushi was compared with doxycycline using flow cytometry assay. The inhibitory concentration 50 (IC(5)(0)) was 3.59x10(-)(3) mug/mL in doxycycline-treated group. Whereas in 0.71x10(-)(3) mug/mL tigecycline-treated group. These findings indicate that tigecycline may be a therapeutic option for the treatment of scrub typhus.
