BACKGROUND/AIMS: Clevudine is a potent antiviral agent against HBV. However, long-term clevudine therapy may cause myopathy. This study was carried out to identify the efficacy of entecavir switching therapy in chronic hepatitis B patients experiencing clevudine-induced myopathy. METHODS: One hundred forty six patients with chronic hepatitis B treated with 30 mg of clevudine per day for 73 weeks (range, 36-132 weeks) were enrolled. Among them, clevudine-induced myopathy occurred in 21 patients (14.4%) which was diagnosed if the patients had symptoms related to myopathy with concurrent CK and AST elevation. All the patients who were diagnosed as clevudine-induced myopathy stopped the therapy, and 17 patients (81%) were switched to entecavir 0.5 mg. RESULTS: The patients with clevudine-induced myopathy were switched to entecavir 0.5 mg for median 68 weeks, and all of them showed disappearance of clinical myopathic symptoms and normalization of CK and AST level within median 2.2 months. Eight patients (47%) were HBeAg positive before entecavir treatment, and HBeAg seroconversion was achieved in 2 patients (25%). HBV DNA level was elevated in 3 patients (17.6%) at the time when the patients were diagnosed as myopathy, all of them achieved virological response with entecavir switching therapy. ALT level was elevated in 3 patients (17.6%) before entecavir treatment, all of them showed normalization of ALT level. During entecavir therapy, genotypic resistance to entecavir or virological breakthrough was not noted. CONCLUSIONS: In chronic hepatitis B patients experiencing clevudine-induced myopathy, switching to entecavir 0.5 mg per day showed a resolution of myopathy and adequate viral suppression.
