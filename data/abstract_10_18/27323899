Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) has been proposed to cope with the increasing antibiotic resistance among pathogens. As versatile pharmacophores, benzylidene cyclopentanone based photosensitizers (PSs) have been used in various bioactive materials. However, their reports as aPDT agents are very limited, and relationships between their chemical structures and antibacterial abilities have not been systematically discussed. Here, nine water-soluble benzylidene cyclopentanone PSs modified by polyethylene glycol (PEG), carboxylate anionic or pyridyl cationic agents are studied for aPDT. It is found that the binding/uptake abilities and aPDT effects of these PSs toward bacterial cells vary significantly when adjusting the number and position of their terminal charged groups. Though the comparable (also best) binding/uptake amounts are achieved by both cationic PS P3 and anionic PS Y1, only Y1 exhibits much more excellent aPDT activities than other PSs. Antibacterial mechanisms reveal that, relative to the favorable cell wall-binding of cationic PS P3, the anionic PS Y1 can accumulate more in the spheroplast/protoplast of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which ensures its high efficient aPDT abilities both in vitro and in vivo. This study suggests the great clinical application potential of Y1 in inactivation of MRSA.
