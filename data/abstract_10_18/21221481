This study evaluated the clonal spread of carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa producing SPM-1 type metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL), at the university hospital of Florianopolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil, compared to an epidemic clone previously reported, as well as strains collected in other three Brazilian states. Among the isolates, 17 (62%) were clonal and highly related to strains from other regions of Brazil. Six clonal strains harbored the blaSPM-1 gene. The finding of a unique SPM-1 producer clone suggests that its dissemination has contributed to the high resistance to carbapenems in Brazilian hospitals.
