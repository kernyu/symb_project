Protein resistance is the central issue in marine antibiofouling. We have prepared poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL)-based polyurethane with 2-(dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate (DEM) as pendant groups by a combination of the thiol-ene click reaction and the condensation reaction. By the use of quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), we have investigated the adsorption of fibrinogen, bovine serum albumin (BSA), and lysozyme on the polymer surface. The polymer exhibits protein resistance in seawater but not in fresh water because DEM pendant groups carry net neutral charges in the former. The evaluation of antibacterial adhesion of the polymer by using Micrococcus luteus demonstrates that the polymer can effectively inhibit the settlement of marine bacteria. Our studies also show that the polymer is degradable in marine environments.
