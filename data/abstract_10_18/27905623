BACKGROUND: Bloodstream infections (BSIs) due to Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium), particularly those due to vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), are still a therapeutic challenge. AIM: To evaluate mortality from BSI due to E. faecium and VRE in central Taiwan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed cases of significant E. faecium BSI in the Changhua Christian Hospital System between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2013. RESULTS: Of the 76 cases, 28 patients (36.8%) were admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) at the onset of BSI, 10 (13.2%) cases were associated with polymicrobial bacteremia, and 29 (38.2%) cases were associated with entry via the biliary tract. VRE was observed in 18 (23.7%) cases. The 30-day mortality rate was 13.1% (10/76). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that bacteremia of non-biliary tract origin (OR = 8.43, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.32-54.00, p = 0.002) and ICU admission (OR = 4.2, 95% CI = 1.7-10.0, p = 0.002) were significant risk factors for 30-day mortality, whereas appropriate antimicrobial therapy was a protective factor for 30-day mortality (OR = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.14-0.79, p = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: Our results underscore the need to assist patients admitted to ICUs with E. faecium BSIs with a non-biliary tract origin. We emphasize the use of appropriate antimicrobial therapy for E. faecium BSI with the aim to rescue more patients with these infections.
