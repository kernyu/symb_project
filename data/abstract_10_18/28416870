This study examined the antibacterial activity of Thymus vulgaris on multiple antibiotic resistant (MAR) Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio fluvialis isolated from shrimps. The ethanol extract of T. vulgaris antibacterial properties was assessed using the agar diffusion method. Survival of test organisms in shrimp meat using different concentrations of T. vulgaris was done using standard method. The quantitative and qualitative phytochemical tests of T. vulgaris extract were determined. The ethanol extract had antimicrobial activities on the test organisms showing 20.00 +/- 0.0 and 23.00 +/- 0.0 mm zone of inhibition on V. parahaemolyticus and V. fluvialis respectively. T. vulgaris completely decreased microbial load of V. parahaemolyticus and V. fluvialis in 150 and 60 min, respectively. The phytochemical screening for the ethanol extract reported phenol, alkaloids, tannin, saponin, anthraquinone flavonoid and cardiac glycoside as 51.76, 26.60, 6.76, 54.33, 30.35 89.65 and 18.23 mg/100 g, respectively. This study reveals the antibacterial property of T. vulgaris on the MAR Vibrio species.
