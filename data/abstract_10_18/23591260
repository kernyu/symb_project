Due to the global threat of antibiotic resistance mediated by New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) and the lack of structurally diverse inhibitors reported for this enzyme, we developed screening and counter-screening assays for manual and automated formats. The manual assay is a trans-well absorbance-based endpoint assay in 96-well plates and has a Z' factor of 0.8. The automated assay is an epi-absorbance endpoint assay in 384-well plates, has a Z' factor of >/=0.8, good signal/baseline ratios (>3.8), and is likely scalable for high-throughput screening (HTS). A TEM-1-based counter-screen is also presented to eliminate false positives due to assay interference or off-target activities. A pilot screen of a pharmacologically characterized compound library identified two thiol-modifying compounds as authentic NDM-1 inhibitors: p-chloromecuribenzoate (p-CMB) and nitroprusside. Recombinant NDM-1 has one Cys residue that serves as a conserved active-site primary zinc ligand and is selectively modified by p-CMB as confirmed by LC-MS/MS. However a C208D mutation results in an enzyme that maintains almost full lactamase activity, yet is completely resistant to the inhibitor. These results predict that covalent targeting of the conserved active-site Cys residue may have drawbacks as a drug design strategy.
