The case of a 27-year-old pregnant woman (gravidity I, parity 0) diagnosed with systemic lupus erytematosus with SS-A-antibodies, activated protein C resistance, and a heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation is presented. Thus, the pregnancy was considered a high-risk pregnancy. Many complications are associated with these diseases, which is why the pregnant woman and her unborn baby needed increased surveillance by internists and obstetricians (laboratory values, clinical symptoms, ultrasound examination). Her current medication with hydroxychloroquine was continued. In addition, low molecular weight heparin was given for thromboprophylaxis.
