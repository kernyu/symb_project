This study applied two phenotypic tests, namely "Carbapenemase Nordmann-Poirel" (CarbaNP) test and "Carbapenem Inactivation Method" (CIM), against the isolates carrying the carbapenem resistance genes. The study included 83 carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates producing oxacillinase-48 (OXA-48) and 30 carbapenem-sensitive Enterobacteriaceae isolates. Out of the total isolates studied, 77 isolates (92.77%) were identified as Klebsiella pneumoniae and six isolates (7.23%) were identified as Escherichia coli by Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method used to detect resistance genes found that 74 isolates (89.16%) produced OXA-48 carbapenemase, whereas nine isolates (10.84%) produced both OXA-48 and New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1). The isolates producing both OXA-48 and NDM-1 were found to be positive by both phenotypic tests. Among isolates carrying only blaOXA-48 gene alone, nine isolates (13.04%) for CarbaNP test and two isolates for CIM test (2.90%) displayed false negative results, respectively. The sensitivity of CarbaNP and CIM tests was found to be 89.16% and 97.59%, respectively, whereas the specificity was determined to be 100% for both tests. These findings suggest that CarbaNP and CIM tests are useful tools to identify the carbapenemase producers. Molecular methods like PCR are recommended to verify false negative tests predicted to have OXA-48 activity.
