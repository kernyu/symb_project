Protein biosynthesis inhibitors (PBIs) represent powerful antimicrobial agents for the control of bacterial infections. In staphylococci, numerous resistance genes are known to be involved in resistance to PBIs, most of which mediate resistance to a specific class/subclass of PBIs, though a few genes do confer a multidrug resistance phenotype-up to five classes/subclasses of PBIs. Plasmids play a key role in the dissemination of PBI resistance among staphylococci, as they primarily carry plasmid-borne PBI resistance genes; however, plasmids also can be vectors for transposon-borne PBI resistance genes. Small plasmids that carry single PBI resistance genes are widespread among staphylococci of human and animal origin. Various mechanisms exist by which they can recombine, form cointegrates, or integrate into chromosomal DNA or larger plasmids. We provide an overview of the current knowledge of plasmid-mediated PBI resistance in staphylococci, with particular reference to the currently known PBI resistance genes, their association with mobile genetic elements, and the recombination/integration processes that control their mobility.
