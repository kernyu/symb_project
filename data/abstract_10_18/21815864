BACKGROUND: The extensive heterogeneity of the hypervariable region-1 (HVR-1) of hepatitis C virus (HCV) evidences the high genetic flexibility of HCV and was shown to be associated with virologic response to interferon-alpha-based therapies. However, the evolution of HVR-1 heterogeneity during treatment with directly acting antivirals has not been studied. METHODS: Clonal sequence analysis of HVR-1 quasispecies in the serum of patients who were treated with telaprevir (3 x 750 mg/day) alone, telaprevir plus pegylated interferon-alpha-2a (pegIFN-alpha-2a), or pegIFN-alpha-2a plus placebo for 14 days was performed. HVR-1 heterogeneity, expressed as Shannon complexity and Hamming distance, was analyzed with virologic response and with the emergence of variants associated with resistance to telaprevir. RESULTS: HVR-1 heterogeneity at baseline was not associated with response to telaprevir-based therapy (Shannon complexity 0.34 vs. 0.55, p = 0.38; Hamming distance 0.15 vs. 0.23, p = 0.51; for patients with or without viral breakthrough, respectively). No significant changes in HVR-1 complexity were observed from baseline to day 4 of therapy in patients in whom a continued decline in HCV RNA was observed (Shannon complexity = 0.55 vs. 0.51, p = 0.67; Hamming distance = 0.23 vs. 0.25, p = 0.81, respectively). This was similar in patients with viral breakthrough associated with telaprevir-resistant variants (Shannon complexity = 0.34 vs. 0.42, p = 0.68; Hamming distance = 0.15 vs. 0.2, p = 0.50, at baseline and day 4, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Baseline and on-treatment HVR-1 heterogeneity are not associated with early viral response to telaprevir-based therapy.
