In the cytoplasm of Plasmodium falciparum, two peroxiredoxins: PfTPx-1 and Pf1-Cys-Prx, are expressed at different time-points of the parasite cell cycle during the intraerythrocytic stage. In the present study, to gain insight into the functions of Prxs in the cytoplasm of P. falciparum, we investigated the heat stress sensitivity of the previously established PfTPx-1 KO line and found that PfTPx-1 disruption renders the parasite hypersensitive to heat stress. In addition, we established Pf1-Cys-Prx knockout (KO) parasite lines. The phenotypes of Pf1-Cys-Prx KO lines were different to those of the PfTPx-1 KO line and did not show hypersensitivity to reactive oxygen species, reactive nitrogen species, chloroquine or heat stress. These results suggest that the function of Pf1-Cys-Prx in the parasite cytoplasm is independent from that of PfTPx-1. The hyperthermal protective function of the PfTPx-1 is obviously important for the parasite physiology in the human patient body, in which it must survive repeated incidences of fever.
