A heavy metal resistant strain, Pseudomonas stutzeri (MTCC 101) has been investigated for its cadmium tolerance properties along with its antibiotic resistance. The organism could tolerate cadmium up to 1,200 mug/mL with LD50 value 700 mug/mL. The gene(s) involved in such high resistance appear(s) to be induced in the presence of the metal. Increasing concentrations of cadmium successively prolonged the lag phase of growth with delayed attainment of the stationary phase. Transmission electron microscope and scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive analysis of X-ray spectroscope analysis showed cadmium adsorption on the bacterial surface with morphological distortion. Atomic absorption spectrometric study corroborated this data, showing highest cadmium accumulation in the cell wall fraction of the bacteria. Additionally, the cell wall fraction showed synthesis of new proteins when grown under metal stress.
