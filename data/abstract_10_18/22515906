INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of prior calcium hydroxide (Ca[OH](2)) intracanal placement on the bond strength of AH Plus (Dentsply DeTrey GmbH, Konstanz, Germany), iRoot SP (Innovative Bioceramix, Vancouver, BC, Canada), and MTA Fillapex (Angelus Solucoes Odontologicas, Londrina, PR, Brazil). METHODS: The root canals of 90 human incisor teeth were prepared with the ProTaper System (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) up to a master apical file size of F5. Canals were filled using the single-cone technique either immediately (the control group, n = 30) or after a 7-day Ca(OH)(2) placement. Ca(OH)(2) removal was performed either manually using F5 with distilled water irrigation (the Ca[OH](2) group, n = 30) or manually using Protaper F5 followed by passive ultrasonic irrigation with 2.5 % NaOCl with a final flush of 17 % EDTA and then distilled water (the PUI group, n = 30). After obturation, a 2-mm-thick middle section of each root was then subjected to push-out testing. RESULTS: Using 1-way analysis of variance, AH Plus showed a higher bond strength than iRoot SP and MTA Fillapex in the control group (P < .05). With prior Ca(OH)(2) placement, AH Plus and iRoot SP showed a similar bond strength (P > .05), which was higher than MTA Fillapex (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Prior Ca(OH)(2) placement seemed to improve the dislodgment resistance of iRoot SP but did not affect AH Plus and MTA Fillapex.
