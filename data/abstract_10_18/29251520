Drug delivery is an important consideration in disease treatment. There are many opportunities for novel methods and technologies to hold promising roles in overcoming traditional obstacles. Delivery systems functionalised to boast synergistic antimicrobial effects, specific targeting, and enhanced bioavailability allow for improved therapeutic potential and better patient outcomes. Many of these delivery modalities find clinical practicality in the field of urology, specifically in the treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and offer advantages over conventional methods. The aim of this review article is to discuss the current modalities of treatment for UTIs and the recent technological advancements for optimising drug delivery. We focus on challenges that persist in drug delivery during UTIs including barriers to antimicrobial penetration, drug resistance, biofilm formation and specific targeting limitations. With a discussion on how emerging methods combat these concerns, we present an overview of potential therapies with special emphasis on nanoparticle-based applications.
