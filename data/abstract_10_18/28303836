This study was undertaken to investigate OprD porin-mediated carbapenem nonsusceptibility in clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from a tertiary referral hospital of Northeast India. A total of 267 nonduplicate, consecutive clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa were obtained. Mutation and expression levels of OprD gene were determined in carbapenem-nonsusceptible carbapenemase-nonproducing isolates. Among 19 carbapenem-nonsusceptible carbapenemase-nonproducing isolates, 11 of them demonstrated variable band pattern while performing denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis with amplified products of OprD gene. Sequencing of variable band products revealed three mutation patterns in three isolates. Relevant decrease in expression of OprD gene could also be observed in them. All the three isolates exhibited a higher minimum inhibitory concentration for imipenem (64-128 mug/mL) compared to meropenem (16-64 mug/mL). Inactivating mutation and decreased expression of OprD contribute mainly to imipenem resistance as well as to meropenem.
