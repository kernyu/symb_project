Treatment options for multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections are limited and often less effective. Non-pharmacologic approaches to preventing or treating MDR infections are currently restricted to improved antimicrobial stewardship and infection control practices. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), a highly effective treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, has emerged as a promising therapy for intestinal MDR bacterial decolonization. A total of eight case reports have been published showing FMT resulted in intestinal decolonization of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The procedure has been shown to work even in immunocompromised patients and those experiencing medical crises without any adverse events. Five trials are currently underway to further investigate the use of FMT for MDR bacterial decolonization. FMT is a completely novel way to eradicate drug-resistant bacteria from the intestinal reservoir and should be further investigated to address the global problem of difficult-to-treat, MDR bacterial infections.
