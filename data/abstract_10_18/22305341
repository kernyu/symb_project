To further explore the anti-enteroviral activity of 9-aryl-6-chloropurines, three different series of compounds with a dialkylamino, (alkyl)amido, or oxazolidinone substituent at the aryl ring have been synthesized, in most cases with the aid of microwave-assisted synthesis. The resulting compounds efficiently inhibit Coxsackie virus type B3 (CVB3) replication with EC(50) values varying from 3 to 15 muM, and with no significant toxicity in Vero cells. The most potent compounds also selectively inhibit the replication of other enteroviruses including Coxsackie virus B4 and Echo virus 11. The cross-resistance studies performed with different 9-aryl-6-chloropurines indicate that they all belong to the same pharmacological family and differ from other CVB3 drugs such as enviroxime.
