SETTINGS: Amazonas is facing increasing challenges in tuberculosis (TB) control, with nearly 3000 cases per year, and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) may jeopardise the TB control programme. OBJECTIVE: To assess the number of MDR-TB cases in the Amazonas and to improve estimates of the burden of TB. DESIGNS: The Brazilian National Mandatory Disease Reporting System (SINAN) and the Brazilian Epidemiological Surveillance System of Multidrug Resistance (TBMR) were searched for MDR-TB cases in the State of Amazonas from 2000 to 2011. RESULTS: Eighty-one MDR-TB cases were notified. The rates of primary MDR-TB, initial MDR-TB during the first treatment regimen and acquired MDR-TB were respectively 3.8%, 13.7% and 82.7%; 26.9% of previously treated patients had 4 treatment cycles. The MDR-TB cases reported 263 contacts, only 35.0% of whom were examined. The cure and death rates among the 81 patients with MDR-TB were respectively 45.7% and 25.9%. CONCLUSIONS: The number of MDR-TB cases seems incompatible with the high TB prevalence in the Amazonas. Most patients were unaware of contact with TB patients. TB is endemic in the Amazonas. This highlights the need for improving resistance investigation among all TB cases.
