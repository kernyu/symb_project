Current evidence shows that thioridazine (THZ) is ready for global clinical evaluation, while some of its derivatives and other efflux pump inhibitors reach the end stage of preclinical evaluation. In this paper, a clinical trial plan is described that investigates the antituberculosis potency, the safety profile and the role of THZ and/or its derivatives in the treatment of TB in humans, both in patients infected with drug sensitive strains as in patients infected with multi or extensive drug resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and some of the patents related to thioridazine are also discussed.
