We evaluated Tuberculosis-Spoligo-Rifampicin-Isoniazid Typing (TB-SPRINT), a microbead-based method for spoligotyping and detection of rifampicin and isoniazid resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. For that, 67 M. tuberculosis complex strains were retrospectively selected. Membrane-based spoligotyping, restriction fragment length polymorphism, DNA sequencing/pyrosequencing of rpoB, katG, and inhA promoter, TB-SPRINT, and SNP typing were performed. Concordance between spoligotyping methods was 99.6% (2,785/2,795 spoligotype data points). For most of the discordant cases, the same lineage was assigned with both methods. Concordance between phenotypic drug susceptibility testing and TB-SPRINT for detecting rifampicin and isoniazid resistance was 98.4% (63/64) and 93.8% (60/64), respectively. Concordance between DNA sequencing/pyrosequencing and TB-SPRINT for detecting mutations in rpoB, katG, and inhA were 98.4% (60/61), 100% (64/64), and 96.9% (62/64), respectively. In conclusion, TB-SPRINT is a rapid and easy-to-perform assay for genotyping and detecting drug resistance in a single tube; therefore, it may be a useful tool to improve epidemiological surveillance.
