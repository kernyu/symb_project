Combination of the Suzuki cross-coupling and nucleophilic aromatic substitution of hydrogen (SN(H)) reactions proved to be a convenient method for the synthesis of C(4) and/or C(5) mono(thienyl) and di(thienyl) substituted pyrimidines from commercially available 5-bromopyrimidine. All new pyrimidines were found to be active in micromolar concentrations in vitro against H37Rv, avium, terrae, rifampicin and isoniazid-resistance strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The data for acute in vivo toxicity in mice have been obtained for these compounds which appear to be promising antitubercular agents.
