The current study was conducted to know the incidence, predisposing factors, spectrum, clinical profile and antifungal susceptibility (AFS) of fungal wound infection (FWI) in burn patients. Of a total of 71 patients, 20 (28.2%) emerged with the diagnosis of FWI. Fungal pathogens in this study were Candida tropicalis (14%), Candida parapsilosis (5.6%), Aspergillus niger (2.8%) and one each of Candida albicans (1.4%), Candida glabrata (1.4%), Syncephalestrum (1.4%) and Fusarium solani (1.4%). All patients with mould infections expired before the mycological culture results could be conveyed to clinicians. Of the yeasts isolated in the study, one each of C. tropicalis and C. albicans showed cross-resistance to azoles. All the moulds were susceptible to amphotericin B. This study depicted that fungal invasion is associated with a high mortality, burn size 30-60% and high incidence of inhalational injury. Fungal invasion was detected on an average of 14 days after injury. Association of use of four classes of drugs - aminoglycosides, imipenem, vancomycin and third generation cephalosporins and use of total parenteral nutrition was observed. Expedient laboratory diagnosis of FWI and appropriate systemic antifungal therapy guided by AFS may improve outcome for severely injured burn victims.
