The aim of this study was to generate and characterize a thiolated carrageenan. Thiolated carrageenan (carrageenan-SH) was synthesized from kappa (kappa)- and iota (iota)-carrageenan by bromine replacement of the hydroxyl moieties followed by substitution to thiol groups using thiourea. Thiolated kappa- and iota-carrageenan exhibited 176.57 +/- 20.11 and 109.51 +/- 18.26 mumol thiol groups per gram polymer, respectively. The resazurin test in Caco-2 cells revealed no toxic effect of both thiolated carrageenans at a concentration below 0.1% (w/v). Regarding efflux pump inhibitory effect, cellular accumulation of multidrug-resistance protein 2 substrate, sulforhodamine 101, was 1.38- and 1.35-fold increased in cells treated with thiolated kappa- and iota-carrageenan, respectively. Modification of kappa- and iota-carrageenan led to 3.9- and 2.0-fold increase in dynamic viscosity of mucus-thiolated carrageenan mixture within 4 h. Furthermore, residence time of kappa- and iota-carrageenan-SH on porcine intestinal mucosa was 6.4- and 1.8-fold prolonged, respectively, as demonstrated by rotating cylinder method, indicating improved mucoadhesive properties. Hence, thiolation of carrageenans led to novel pharmaceutical excipients for various applications.
