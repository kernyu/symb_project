Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) has demonstrated long-term efficacy and a high barrier to resistance in multiple chronic hepatitis B (CHB) populations outside of China. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TDF compared with adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) in Chinese patients with CHB during 48 weeks of treatment (ClinicalTrial.gov number, NCT01300234). A Phase 3, multicentred, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial compared the efficacy and safety of TDF with ADV in Chinese patients with CHB. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with HBV DNA <400 copies/mL in each treatment group at Week 48, using an unpooled Z-test for superiority. Secondary endpoints included viral suppression, serologic response, histological improvement, normalization of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and the emergence of resistance mutations. A total of 509 patients, 202 hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive and 307 HBeAg-negative, with HBV DNA >/=10(5) copies/mL received either TDF 300 mg od or ADV 10 mg od. At Week 48, TDF demonstrated superior viral suppression compared with ADV in both HBeAg-positive (76.7% vs 18.2%, P < 0.0001) and HBeAg-negative (96.8% vs 71.2%, P < 0.0001) patients. The majority of patients in both treatment arms achieved ALT normalization (>85%). No resistance to TDF was observed. The frequency of adverse events was comparable between treatment arms (TDF 3.9% vs ADV 4.8%). In this double-blind, randomized, clinical trial, TDF demonstrated superiority over ADV with respect to viral suppression in Chinese patients with CHB at 48 weeks of treatment and without the development of resistance.
