BACKGROUND: There is paucity of data on the epidemiology of bloodstream infections in pediatric cancer patients from India. Rationale use of antibiotics in febrile neutropenia is important for reducing morbidity and preventing the emergence of drug resistant bacteria. AIMS: The study was conducted to look at the prevalence of bloodstream bacterial infection and the antibiotic resistance profile at Cancer Institute, Chennai. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This was a retrospective study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data on all blood cultures taken from pediatric cancer patients treated at Cancer Institute, Chennai, during the year 2013 were analyzed. The microbiological profile and sensitivity pattern were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 1045 blood culture samples were taken, and there were 82/1045 (7.5%) positive blood cultures. Gram-negative organisms accounted for 50/82 (61%) of all positive cultures. Klebsiella pneumoniae (32%) was the most common Gram-negative isolate, and Staphylococcus aureus (93.5%) was the most common Gram-positive. There was high resistance to aminoglycosides and beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor antibodies. CONCLUSION: Gram-negative organisms are the predominant bacteria isolated. There is high resistance to first-line combination antibiotics used as empiric therapy for treatment of febrile neutropenia.
