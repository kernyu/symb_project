Current treatments for chronic hepatitis B are effective in only a fraction of patients. All approved directly antiviral agents are nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs) that target the DNA polymerase activity of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) P protein; resistance and cross-resistance may limit their long-term applicability. P protein is an unusual reverse transcriptase that initiates reverse transcription by protein priming, by which a Tyr residue in the unique terminal protein domain acts as an acceptor of the first DNA nucleotide. Priming requires P protein binding to the epsilon stem-loop on the pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) template. This interaction also mediates pgRNA encapsidation and thus provides a particularly attractive target for intervention. Exploiting in vitro priming systems available for duck HBV (DHBV) but not HBV, we demonstrate that naphthylureas of the carbonyl J acid family, in particular KM-1, potently suppress protein priming by targeting P protein and interfering with the formation of P-DHBV epsilon initiation complexes. Quantitative evaluation revealed a significant increase in complex stability during maturation, yet even primed complexes remained sensitive to KM-1 concentrations below 10 muM. Furthermore, KM-1 inhibited the DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity of both DHBV and HBV nucleocapsids, including from a lamivudine-resistant variant, directly demonstrating the sensitivity of human HBV to the compound. Activity against viral replication in cells was low, likely due to low intracellular availability. KM-1 is thus not yet a drug candidate, but its distinct mechanism of action suggests that it is a highly useful lead for developing improved, therapeutically applicable derivatives.
