This is the first report to test the loading dosage of colistin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including MDRP. Using in vivo murine thigh infection model, in the loading dosage regimen (Day 1:50 mg/kg q12 h, Day 2-3: 25 mg/kg q12 h) group, 5 to 6 log10 CFU/ml reduction compared with control were observed for both strains of P. aeruginosa with colistin MIC 0.5 and 1 mug/mL at 72 h. But, similar reduction was observed for the strains with colistin MIC 0.5 mug/mL only in normal dosage regimen (Day 1-3: 25 mg/kg q12 h) group. For P. aeruginosa with colistin MIC 1 mug/mL, colistin loading dosage regimens showed greater antimicrobial activity than that of without loading dosage group (p < 0.05). These data suggest that the colistin loading regimen would be one of the useful options for P. aeruginosa with antimicrobial resistance infection treatment.
