We recently isolated an influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 E119D/H275Y neuraminidase (NA) variant from an immunocompromised patient who received oseltamivir and zanamivir therapies. This variant demonstrated cross resistance to zanamivir, oseltamivir, peramivir and laninamivir. In this study, the viral fitness of the recombinant wild-type (WT), E119D and E119D/H275Y A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses was evaluated in vitro and in experimentally-infected C57BL/6 mice and guinea pigs. In replication kinetics experiments, viral titers obtained with the E119D and E119D/H275Y recombinants were up to 2- and 4-log lower compared to the WT virus in MDCK and ST6GalI-MDCK cells, respectively. Enzymatic studies revealed that the E119D mutation significantly decreased the surface NA activity. In experimentally-infected mice, a 50% mortality rate was recorded in the group infected with the WT recombinant virus whereas no mortality was observed in the E119D and E119D/H275Y groups. Mean lung viral titers on day 5 post-inoculation for the WT (1.2 +/- 0.57 x 10(8) PFU/ml) were significantly higher than those of the E119D (9.75 +/- 0.41 x 10(5) PFU/ml, P < 0.01) and the E119D/H275Y (1.47 +/- 0.61 x 10(6) PFU/ml, P < 0.01) groups. In guinea pigs, comparable seroconversion rates and viral titers in nasal washes (NW) were obtained for the WT and mutant index and contact groups. However, the D119E reversion was observed in most NW samples of the E119D and E119D/H275Y animals. In conclusion, the E119D NA mutation that could emerge in A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses during zanamivir therapy has a significant impact on viral fitness and such mutant is unlikely to be highly transmissible.
