Nevirapine (NVP) was the first nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) approved for the treatment of HIV infection. NVP can provide safe and efficacious viral suppression for treatment-naive patients and for virologically controlled patients "switching" from other NNRTI or protease inhibitor-based regimens. Formulations allowing once-daily dosing of antiretrovirals can significantly improve regimen adherence, which is important for maintaining virologic control, especially for NNRTI-based regimens with low barriers for genetic resistance. Randomized and controlled clinical trials have established the clinical non inferiority of a new, extended-release formulation (XR) of NVP, in both treatment-naive (VERxVE) and treatment-experienced patients (TRANxITION), where patients already stable on the immediate-release formulation of NVP were safely transitioned directly to NVP XR. As a potentially more convenient once-daily option, NVP XR may improve adherence and reduce the risk of mutant viruses, attendant virologic failure, and the spread of drug resistance.
