The expression of Mx1 in EPC cells after treatment with poly(I:C) or infection with viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) was significantly suppressed by treatment with dexamethasone. However, the titer of VHSV did not increase but instead decreased after dexamethasone treatment. This suggests that dexamethasone not only downregulates type I IFN but also affects certain factors that are necessary for VHSV replication. An important effect of HSP90 on replication of RNA viruses and downregulation of HSP90 by glucocorticoids have been reported. In this study, dexamethasone downregulated HSP90alpha expression in EPC cells that were stimulated with poly(I:C) or infected with VHSV. Furthermore, cells treated with an HSP90 inhibitor, geldanamycin, showed significantly decreased titers of VHSV, suggesting that HSP90 may be an important host component involved in VHSV replication, and HSP90 inhibition might be one of the causes for the observed reduction in viral titer caused by dexamethasone treatment.
