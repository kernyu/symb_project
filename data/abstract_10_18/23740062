INTRODUCTION: Amphotericin B (AMB) is an antifungal agent used extensively in clinical medicine, yet resistance remains low. This study aims to evaluate the susceptibility of Candida spp. against AMB. METHODS: For broth microdilution susceptibility testing, 77 strains of Candida spp. were selected (32 C. albicans, 33 C. tropicalis, and 12 C. parapsilosis). The strains were considered susceptible when they exhibited MIC</=1.0microg/ml. RESULTS: None of the strains showed an MIC greater than 0.25microg/ml. CONCLUSIONS: Further works are necessary, with a higher number of strains, to assess the validity of the results used in this study.
