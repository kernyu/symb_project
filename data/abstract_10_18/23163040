AIM: Study prebiotic properties of mannose and its effect on colonization resistance in experiments in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experimental dysbiosis was induced by introduction into non-linear mice of doxycycline hydrochloride. Prebiotic properties of mannose were studied by a single per oral administration to mice of increasing doses of preparation for a week compared with probiotics lactobacterin and bifidumbacterin. Lumen microflora was analyzed in feces. TNF-alpha level was determined by using a commercial kit OpTEIA ELISA Kit. Phagocytic activity of neutrophils and macrophages was studied in a cytochemical test of nitroblue tetrazolium reduction (NTT test) and by luminol-dependent chemiluminescence. Phagocytic activity and digestive ability of alveolar macrophages was studied. RESULTS: The ability of mannose along with probiotic preparations bifidumbacterin and lactobacterin to restore the composition and numbers of indigenous microflora of mice under the conditions of experimental dysbiosis was revealed. Per oral administration of mannose and probiotic strains together with mannose was established to cause stimulating effect on functional activity of macrophages increasing ingesting and digesting ability of the cells and facilitates reduction of TNF-alpha levels. CONCLUSION: Mannose has prebiotic effect; the ability of mannose to induce expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines gives evidence of immunostimulating properties of the monosaccharide.
