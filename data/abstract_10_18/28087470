Pleurotus ostreatus was transformed using the nourseothricin-resistant gene for the first time. The transformation efficiency was 1.3+/-0.6transformants/mug plasmid DNA. In addition, the transformation efficiency of the bialaphos-resistant gene was increased to 26.7+/-11.5transformants/mug plasmid DNA.
