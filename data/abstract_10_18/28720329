Tryptanthrin is a natural alkaloidal compound having basic indoloquinazoline moiety. It is obtained from various natural plant sources as well as different cell cultures including yeast etc. Trptanthrin is considered as biogenetic precursor for phaitanthrin A-C, pyrroloindoloquinazoline, (+/-)-cruciferane. Different synthetic approaches for the synthesis of tryptanthrin have been very well reported. It has broad spectrum of biological activities including anticancer activity, anti-inflammatory, antiprotozoal, antiallergic, antioxidant, and antimicrobial. In this review, our focus will be, on the various approaches for the synthesis of tryptanthrins and its derivatives along with the biological activities.
