BACKGROUND: The widespread use of intrapartum antibiotics (IPA) has raised concerns regarding the adverse effects on the newborn. OBJECTIVES: To determine if IPA is associated with infantile late-onset serious bacterial infections (SBIs) and with antibiotic resistance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 2005 to 2009, data were prospectively collected for all infants born at our center, aged 7 to 90 days, who were hospitalized for fever. Cases included infants with culture-proven SBIs, and controls included infants without SBIs. Results. A total of 71 cases and 124 controls were included. IPA was documented in 11.3% of cases and in 7.3% of controls (P = .34). Among cases, ampicillin resistance was documented in 85% of antibiotic-exposed infants and in 63% of nonexposed infants (P = .19). Corresponding rates for first-generation cephalosporin resistance in urinary tract infection were 75% and 23.5% (P = .04). CONCLUSION: IPA is associated with a trend toward increased antibiotic resistance in late-onset SBIs. This should be taken into consideration in the selection of empirical therapy for febrile infants.
