BACKGROUND: Nitric oxide (NO) is released in the airway as a critical component of innate immune defense against invading pathogenic organisms. It is well documented that bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects of NO are concentration-dependent. However, few data exist comparing relative susceptibility of common pathogens to NO at physiologic concentrations. In this study we evaluated the effects of NO on 4 common airway bacteria and 1 fungus, and examined the potential implications of discrepancies in sensitivity. METHODS: Staphylococcus epidermis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans cultures were adjusted to a uniform optical density (OD) and grown in log phase at 37 degrees C with varying concentrations of NO formed by DETA NONOate. Both OD readings and colony forming units (CFUs) were measured at varying time-points to evaluate for inhibitory effects of NO. RESULTS: P aeruginosa and C albicans were significantly more sensitive to NO at physiologic concentrations typical of the human airway. S aureus was attenuated by NO to a lesser degree, and K pneumoniae and S epidermis were more resistant to NO at all concentrations tested. Air surface liquid from cultured human sinonasal epithelial cells had an additive effect in bacterial killing of P aeruginosa, but not in S aureus. CONCLUSION: Common airway pathogens have varying levels of susceptibility to NO at physiologic concentrations of innate immune defense. Relative sensitivity of P aeruginosa and relative resistance of S epidermis may help explain the composition of the healthy microbiome, as well as opportunistic infection in the absence of induced NO release.
