Forty-two enrofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli strains isolated from eggs and first-week mortality associated with yolk sac infection of two vertically integrated poultry companies of Central Mexico in 1997 and 2005 were characterised. E. coli resistance to 19 antibiotics was determined, as well as the minimum inhibitory concentrations (broth dilution) for ciprofloxacin. The presence of gyrA,B, parC,E chromosomal point mutations, qnrA,B,S plasmid genes and the aminoglycoside acetyltransferase aac(6')-Ib-cr were determined by PCR and sequencing. Resistance to ampicillin (95%), piperacillin (95%), gatifloxacin (95%), levofloxacin (95%), ampicillin/sulbactam (90%), cefazolin (85%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (80%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (80%), aztreonam (80%), cefepime (80%), cefotaxime (80%), ceftazidime (80%), ceftriaxone (80%) and cefoxitin (75%) was high in the 2005 strains and 19 (95%) strains were resistant to 7 or more antimicrobials. The strains from 1997 expressed high rates of resistance only to the fluoroquinolones and 4 strains (18%) expressed resistance to 7 or more antimicrobials. All strains had a gyrA mutation (Ser83Leu) and a parC mutation (Ser80Ile or Ser80Arg) and 41 (97.6%) strains had a second gyrA mutation (Asp87Asn, Asp87Tyr or Asp87Gly). Only two (4.7%) strains had a parE mutation (Ser458Ala). A total of 10 strains were positive for the aac(6')-Ib wild-type gene, 6 strains for the aac(6')-Ib-cr variant and 6 strains possessed both the wild type and the variant. No gyrB mutations or qnrA,B,S genes were detected. This is the first report in Latin America of chromosomal and plasmid quinolone resistance genes in E. coli strains recovered from poultry.
