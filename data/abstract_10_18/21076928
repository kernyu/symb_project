Nasal swabs of 423 healthy humans who showed different levels of contact with animals (frequent, 168; sporadic, 94; no contact, 161) were obtained in Tunisia (2008-2009), and 99 of them presented other associated risk factors. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was detected in one of these 423 samples (0.24%), retrieved from a veterinarian. The MRSA isolate was mecA-positive, typed as ST80-t203-SCCmecIVc-agrIII, and contained tet(K), ant(6)-Ia, and aph(3')-IIIa genes encoding tetracycline, streptomycin, and kanamycin resistance, respectively. This MRSA isolate also contained the lukF/lukS virulence gene encoding Panton-Valentine leukocidin. Fifty-four (12.8%) additional nasal samples contained methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and one isolate/sample was characterized. A high diversity of spa types (n = 43; 4 new) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) types (n = 37) was detected among the 55 recovered S. aureus strains. The percentages of antimicrobial resistance/detected resistance genes were as follows: tetracycline [22%/tet(K)-tet(L)-tet(M)], erythromycin [5%/msrA], ciprofloxacin [14.5%], trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [2%/dfrA], streptomycin [11%/ant(6)-Ia], kanamycin [7%/aph(3')-IIIa], amikacin [5%], and chloramphenicol [2%]. Four and two isolates carried the lukF/lukS and eta and/or etb genes, respectively, and always in individuals with contact with animals. Eleven isolates carried the tst gene and were recovered from individuals with different levels of contact with animals.
