Yr36 is an important gene conferring resistance to stripe rust of wheat caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst). To determine if the Yr36 resistance is correlated to reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst and cell death, wheat near-isogenic lines with (UC1041 + Yr36) and without (UC1041) the gene were histologically characterized for response to Pst infection. Yr36 conferred stripe rust resistance at both seedling and adult-plant stages when the gene line was tested with Pst race CYR29 at a high-temperature (HT) cycle (12 degrees C at night and 33 degrees C during the day). At the HT cycle, the growth of secondary hyphae was obviously suppressed in both seedlings and adult plants of UC1041 + Yr36 compared with those of UC1041. The percentages of infection sites with necrotic host cells in UC1041 + Yr36 were significantly higher than UC1041 60 hours after inoculation (hai) at both seedling and adult-plant stages. Mesophyll cell death in the inoculated UC1041 + Yr36 leaves at the HT cycle was stronger than at a low-temperature (LT) cycle (12 degrees C at night and 18 degrees C during the day). At the HT cycle, the level of ROS burst started increasing in the inoculated leaves of UC1041 + Yr36 when Pst hyphae started differentiating and extending, and simultaneously, the number of penetration sites with hypersensitive cell death was also increasing. The results indicate that Yr36 product affects the ROS accumulation and cell death of the host in interaction of wheat with Pst.
