We analyzed non-serotype b encapsulated Haemophilus influenzae (non-b Hi) isolated from pediatric patients at Chiba Children's Hospital during 2000-2012. Among 3,532 clinical isolates of H. influenzae, there were 57 (1.6%) strains of non-b Hi, 152 (4.3%) of serotype b H. influenzae (Hib), and 3,323 (94.1%) of non-typeable H. influenzae (NTHi). Fifty-seven strains of non-b Hi were serotyped useing the slide agglutination test and PCR. Twenty-nine strains were identified as type e (Hie) and 28 as type f (Hif), and the results according to the slide agglutination test and PCR were completely identical. Whereas 52 of 57 strains (91.2%) were isolated from respiratory specimen, only one Hif strain (1.8%) was isolated from a sterile site. There were 47 (82.4%) beta-lactamase-non-producing ampicillin (ABPC)-sensitive strains (BLNAS), 5 (8.8%) beta-lactamase-producing strains (BLP), and only 1 (1.8%) beta-lactamase-non-producing ABPC-resistant strain (BLNAR). Thus the frequency of non-b Hi was lower than that of Hib. The source of non-b Hi was similar to that of NTHi, which was mainly isolated from respiratory specimen. Antimicrobial resistant pattern of non-b Hi was different from that of Hib in which the frequency of BLP was relatively high, and NTHi in which that of BLNAR was high. An increase of invasive H. influenzae infections caused by NTHi, Hie, and Hif was reported in the countries where Hib vaccine had been widely used. Because it is assumed that invasive non-Hib infection will be predominant in the near future in Japan, serotyping of invasive strains is crucial. Continuous monitoring of distribution of non-b Hi in the clinical isolates of H. influenzae is also important.
