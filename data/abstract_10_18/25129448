BACKGROUND: The use of antibiotics is considered a major determinant of the development of resistance in organisms. This study assessed current patterns of antibiotic prescription and provides background for quality improvement in general hospitals in Hubei, China. METHODS: A point-prevalence study was performed in November 2008. All inpatients on the day of the survey were included in the analysis. RESULTS: On the day of the study, 6904 patients (56%) were receiving antibiotic therapy; the highest rate occurred in the ICU (90%), and the lowest occurred in the medical wards (39%). The most commonly used antibiotics were beta-lactam antibiotics, including cephalosporins (40%) and piperacillin (19%), followed by fluoroquinolones (14%). CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicated a high rate of antibiotic use in Chinese hospitals. These findings suggest important areas for intervention and the implementation of antibiotic stewardship policies in Chinese hospitals. A multi-faceted strategy should be implemented at the national level in China and should include education, regulation, and greater financial support from the government.
