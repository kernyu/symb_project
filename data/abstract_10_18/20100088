BACKGROUND: The viral fitness of neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI)-resistant influenza viruses is believed to be impaired. Unexpectedly, an oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1) variant containing the H274Y neuraminidase (NA) mutation recently disseminated worldwide, suggesting that the replication and virulence properties of this mutant virus were not compromised. METHODS: In vitro replicative capacities were determined for old (A/WSN/33, A/Mississipi/3/01, A/New Caledonia/20/99, and A/Solomon Islands/03/06) and recent (A/Brisbane/59/2007-like) influenza A(H1N1) viruses either harboring or not harboring the H274Y NA mutation. Ferrets were infected with the A/Brisbane/59/2007-like wild-type (WT) isolate and its H274Y NA variant. RESULTS: Old A(H1N1) WT viruses grew at higher titers than did the A/Brisbane/59/2007-like viruses in vitro. The H274Y mutation was associated with reduced viral plaque areas in cells infected with A/WSN/33 and A/Mississippi/3/01, whereas the 2 A/Brisbane/59/2007-like isolates showed similar plaque sizes. In ferrets, the pyrexic response induced by the A/Brisbane/59/2007-like H274Y mutant was significantly higher than that induced by the WT isolate. Nasal wash viral titers were significantly greater for the mutant isolate on day 2 after inoculation, whereas the 2 viruses showed similar titers between days 3 and 7 after inoculation. CONCLUSIONS: The viral fitness of the recent A/Brisbane/59/2007-like H274Y variant is not impaired, consistent with its global dissemination. These results reinforce the need for new antiviral strategies.
