BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend vancomycin trough concentrations of 15 to 20 microg/mL in complicated infections and all trough concentrations >10 microg/mL to avoid developing microbial resistance. To date, no published protocol reliably meets these recommendations for obese patients. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the performance of a novel, obese-specific, divided-load vancomycin protocol for attaining target trough concentrations within 12 to 24 hours of dosing initiation, and during maintenance dosing, in obese patients. METHODS: The protocol was evaluated through prospective medical record review in 54 consecutive obese patients. Vancomycin serum concentrations were drawn before the third and fifth dose after initiation. Steady-state concentrations were drawn after the third dose once maintenance dosing was achieved and periodically thereafter. RESULTS: Within 12 hours after dosing initiation, 48 (89%) study patients exhibited trough concentrations of 10 to 20 microg/mL averaging 14.5 +/- 3.2 microg/mL; 51 (94%) study patients exhibited trough concentrations >10 microg/mL within 12 hours after dosing initiation, and 3 (6%) had trough concentrations >20 microg/mL. Thirty-one participants had second trough concentrations drawn within 24 hours of dosing initiation, averaging 15.0 +/- 3.1 microg/mL; 24 patients had a total of 32 trough concentrations drawn during maintenance dosing, averaging 15.1 +/- 2.5 microg/mL. CONCLUSION: Obese-specific, divided-load dosing achieved trough concentrations of 10 to 20 microg/mL for 89% of obese patients within 12 hours of initial dosing and 97% of obese patients within 24 hours of initial dosing while preventing doses given during supratherapeutic trough levels; 97% of troughs measured during steady state were within target range.
