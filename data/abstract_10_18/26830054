Amoxicillin-clavulanate MICs of 160 Escherichia coli isolates with characterized resistance mechanisms were obtained by 2 MIC gradient strip brands, 3 automated systems, and reference ISO microdilution method using EUCAST (fixed 2mug/mL clavulanate) and CLSI (2:1 ratio) criteria. Discrepancies, mainly obtained with gradient strips, lead to an essential agreement range of 76.2-92.5.
