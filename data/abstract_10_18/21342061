The journal Antiviral Research was conceived and born in 1980, and launched in 1981, a time when very few antiviral drugs were around. This 30-year celebration meeting was convened by the publisher Elsevier and chaired by Eric de Clercq (Leuven University), who has acted as editor-in-chief for the journal for the last 30 years. Approximately 220 participants representing 36 countries attended the congress, which covered topics such as emerging viruses, virus-host interactions, new antiviral drugs and antiviral resistance.
