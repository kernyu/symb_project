Avermectins and milbemycins (AM) are potent compounds against all major nematode parasites, but their continuous usage has led to the development of widespread resistance in many of the important species of ruminant and equine parasites. The exception to this has been the cyathostomins, where AM resistance was recently first reported only after decades of drug exposure. Data from a Brazilian study suggests that AM resistance has developed in cyathostomins and reports of shortened egg reappearance periods after ivermectin treatment have been published recently from USA and Germany. Thus, AM resistance in cyathostomins is an emerging worldwide concern, but there is only limited amount data on the extent of this problem. To limit the development and spread of AM-resistant cyathostomins the equine industry must implement new strategies for worm control, and the veterinary parasitology community must develop and validate improved protocols for detecting anthelmintic resistance in the field.
