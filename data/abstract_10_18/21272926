OBJECTIVES: In recent years, cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been reported to be correlated with chemoresistance and may also be enriched in side populations (SPs). In this study, the relationship between resistance to paclitaxel (PTX) and cisplatin (CDDP) and side populations was examined in three parental PTX- and CDDP-sensitive ovarian cancer cell lines (2008, KF28, and TU-OM-1) and several other cell lines derived from these as well as the additional effects of interferon-alpha (INF-alpha). METHODS: SP of three different parental cell lines and PTX- and/or CDDP-resistant cell lines derived from these was analyzed with flow cytometry. The expression of ABCB1 and ABCG2 in KF28 and its derived cell lines was examined. Additional cell-death effect of INF-alpha with PTX was also examined. RESULTS: In the three parental cell lines and the PTX-sensitive cell lines derived from these lines, SP was very low. Conversely, in PTX-resistant cell lines, regardless of CDDP resistance, SP increased. ABCB1 was strongly expressed in the PTX-resistant cells, but not in their parental lines, which are sensitive to PTX. While INF-alpha showed only slight enhancement of the cell-death effect of PTX in PTX-sensitive cells, INF-alpha itself strongly induced apoptosis in PTX-resistant cells regardless of PTX concentration. CONCLUSIONS: The SP could be correlated with resistance to PTX. SP could be a target of INF-alpha, and resistance to PTX might be overcome by INF-alpha.
