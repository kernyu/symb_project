The aims of this study were to investigate any change in PCR ribotypes and to determine the antimicrobial resistance of common PCR ribotypes over a 10-year period in a tertiary care hospital. We conducted PCR ribotyping, antimicrobial susceptibility testing and DNA gyrase sequencing to identify changes in 1407 Clostridium difficile non-duplicated isolates obtained between 2000 and 2009. A total of 74 different ribotypes were found. The most prevalent ribotype was ribotype 001 (26.1 %). The prevalence of ribotype 017 was 17 % and that of ribotype 014/020 was 9.6 %. Ribotyping showed that the prevalence of ribotype 001 decreased and the prevalence of ribotypes 017, 014/020 and 018 increased over the 10 years. Antimicrobial resistance rates in prevalent ribotypes were: clindamycin, 81 %; cefotetan, 19 %; moxifloxacin, 42 %; imipenem, 8 %; ciprofloxacin, 100 % and erythromycin, 80 %. Ribotype 018 showed greater antimicrobial resistance than other ribotypes. All ribotype 018 strains showing moxifloxacin resistance had a substitution of a gyrA coding amino acid (Thr82 to Ile). This study will help the understanding of PCR ribotype trends and antimicrobial resistance of C. difficile in Korea.
