BACKGROUND: Multi-drug-resistant organisms (MDRO) complicate care increasingly on the general ward and in the emergency department, operating room, and intensive care unit (ICU). Whereas barrier precautions are important in limiting transmission of MDRO between patients, few tactics have been defined that reduce the genesis of MDRO. METHOD: Review of pertinent English-language literature. RESULTS: Antibiotic heterogeneity practices, as part of an overall antimicrobial drug stewardship program, offer one readily deployable means to reduce selection pressure for MDRO development in the ICU. The data underpinning this approach and data derived from its use indicate that, especially in surgical ICUs, heterogeneity of antibiotic prescribing can preserve or restore microbial ecology, reduce the prevalence of MDRO and the incidence of infections caused thereby, and facilitate the implementation and effectiveness of other antibiotic-sparing tactics, such as de-escalation. CONCLUSION: Heterogeneity of antibiotic prescribing is effective in preventing the dissemination of MDRO pathogens.
