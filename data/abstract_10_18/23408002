We report a secondary case of rifampicin-resistant meningococcal disease and our experience in managing contact cases. Rifampicin resistance resulting from rpoB gene mutations is still uncommon enough that changing the current recommendations for chemoprophylaxis is unwarranted. However, ensuring limited but appropriate chemoprophylaxis may prevent the development of antimicrobial resistance. Thus, the definition of contact cases should be strictly respected. In the case of culture-positive Neisseria meningitidis, in vitro susceptibility testing to rifampicin must be systematically performed in order to detect rifampicin-resistant strains and, thus, institute appropriate prophylaxis in order to prevent secondary transmission.
