This study shows microbiological contamination of water in two main Podhale rivers, whose resources are used for the production of artificial snow, and the resulting snow contamination. Thirty-one E. coli strains were isolated from snow at two ski stations in the studied region, their antimicrobial resistance was determined, and the presence of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) genes was searched for. The results indicate that the waters of both rivers are severely contaminated, resulting in the contamination of artificial snow with, among others, thermotolerant E. coli. E. coli isolated from snow were most frequently resistant to ampicillin (74.19%) and amoxicillin/clavulanate (51.61% isolates). Aminoglycosides and third generation cephalosporins were most efficient among the tested antimicrobials. Some bacterial strains were multidrug resistant and three strains exhibited the ESBL mechanism. Molecular analyses showed the presence of ESBL genes in the same three strains. Genetic variation among E. coli indicates that only some genotypes are able to survive the artificial snow production process.
