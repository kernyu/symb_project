BACKGROUND: Staphylococci are commonly associated with antibiotic resistance in healthcare settings including resistance to methicillin and other beta lactam antibiotics primarily associated with the carriage of SCCmec mobile genetic elements. We investigated oxacillin susceptibility in 11 different species of environmental staphylococci to evaluate the potential dissemination of such resistance determinants in staphylococcal isolates from non-healthcare environments. RESULTS: Staphylococci isolated from public washrooms were analysed for SCCmec type and for antibiotic susceptibility. MICs to oxacillin ranged from 0.12 to 128 mg/L. Of the 32 strains investigated, there were representatives of 11 different species of staphylococci. 21 of the 32 isolates were assigned to known SCCmec types. These typeable strains primarily included those assigned to SCCmec type I (n = 8), type IV (n = 6) and type VI (n = 7). In addition to these isolates, 3 strains of EMRSA-15 were identified from different environmental sites. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated the diversity of SCCmec elements in a wide range of staphylococcal species isolated from outside of healthcare settings. We have also shown that the variability in oxacillin MICs in such isolates are unrelated to species or SCCmec type. The isolation of EMRSA-15 is also of concern to infection control in the community.
