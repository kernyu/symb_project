Lactobacillus johnsonii PF01, an autochthonous bacterium of the gastrointestinal tract, was isolated from a fecal sample from a piglet. The strain adhered specifically to the duodenal and jejunal epithelial cells of the piglet and had high bile resistance activity. Here we report the genomic sequence of L. johnsonii PF01.
