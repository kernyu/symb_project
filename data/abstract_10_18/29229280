OBJECTIVES: To determine the antibiotic susceptibility of N. gonorrhoeae in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Laos). METHODS: We obtained 158 gonococcal isolates from 12,281 genital samples routinely submitted to a diagnostic laboratory in Vientiane, Laos between 2011 and 2015 and determined their susceptibility to five antibiotics by a standard disk diffusion method. RESULTS: The rates of resistance to penicillin (by beta-lactamase production), tetracycline and ciprofloxacin were 89.9%, 99.3% and 84.8% respectively. All isolates were sensitive to ceftriaxone and spectinomycin. CONCLUSIONS: This situation is similar to that in neighboring countries, but fortunately means that the latest Lao national guidelines for treating gonorrhoea should still be effective.
