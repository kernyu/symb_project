BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Mycobacterium w (M.w) is a saprophytic cultivable mycobacterium and shares several antigens with M. tuberculosis. It has shown good immunomodulation in leprosy patients. Hence in the present study, the efficacy of M.w immunotherapy, alone or in combination with multi drug chemotherapeutic regimens was investigated against drug sensitive M. tuberculosis H37Rv and three clinical isolates with variable degree of drug resistance in mice. METHODS: BALB/c mice were infected with M. tuberculosis H37Rv (susceptible to all first and second line drugs) and three clinical isolates taken from the epository of the Institute. The dose of 200 bacilli was used for infection via respiratory route in an aerosol chamber. Chemotherapy (5 days/wk) was given one month after infection and the vaccinated group was given a dose of 1x107 bacilli by subcutaneous route. Bacterial load was measured at 4 and 6 wk after initiation of chemotherapy. RESULTS: M.w when given along with chemotherapy (4 and 6 wk) led to a greater reduction in the bacterial load in lungs and other organs of TB infected animals compared to. However, the reduction was significantly (P<0.05) more in terms of colony forming units (cfu) in both organs (lungs and spleen). CONCLUSION: M.w (as immunomodulator) has beneficial therapeutic effect as an adjunct to chemotherapy.
