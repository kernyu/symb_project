BACKGROUND: Voriconazole is a first-line agent for the treatment of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). There are increasing reports of Aspergillus fumigatus isolates with reduced susceptibility to voriconazole. METHODS: An in vitro dynamic model of IPA was developed that enabled simulation of human-like voriconazole pharmacokinetics. Galactomannan was used as a biomarker. The pharmacodynamics of voriconazole against wild-type and 3 resistant strains of A. fumigatus were defined. The results were bridged to humans to provide decision support for setting breakpoints for voriconazole using Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and European Committee of Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) methodologies. RESULTS: Isolates with higher minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) required higher area under the concentration time curves (AUCs) to achieve suppression of galactomannan. Using CLSI and EUCAST methodologies, the AUC:MIC values that achieved suppression of galactomannan were 55 and 32.1, respectively. Using CLSI and EUCAST methodologies, the trough concentration:MIC values that achieved suppression of galactomannan were 1.68 and 1, respectively. Potential CLSI breakpoints for voriconazole are </= 0.5 mg/L for susceptible and >1 mg/L for resistant. Potential EUCAST breakpoints for voriconazole are </=1 mg/L for susceptible and >2 mg/L for resistant. CONCLUSIONS: This dynamic model of IPA is a useful tool to address many remaining questions related to antifungal treatment of Aspergillus spp.
