INTRODUCTION: Sofosbuvir (SOF) with simeprevir (SIM) combination was the first interferon-free regimen that reached optimal results in terms of sustained viral response (SVR). Areas covered: A systematic review of the scientific literature concerning the effects that the SOF/SIM combination had on hepatitis C genotype 1 patients yielded 771 references. After the revision process, four clinical trials and 15 observational studies met the inclusion criteria; in total, these studies involved 5,766 patients. The SVR ranged from 67% to 100% depending on the patients' viral subtype and cirrhosis status. Adverse effects were common, but treatment discontinuation related to drug toxicity occurred in less than 5% of cases. Expert commentary: The SOF/SIM combination exhibits efficacy and tolerability profiles that are similar to those of the other available interferon-free combinations used for non-cirrhotic genotype 1b patients. Meanwhile, for patients with advanced cirrhosis or genotype 1a, this approach cannot be considered a routine treatment option due to the unsatisfactory results.
