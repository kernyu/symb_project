New insights on the amantadine resistance mechanism of the V27A mutant were obtained through the study of novel, easily accessible 4-(1- and 2-adamantyl)piperidines, identified as dual binders of the wild-type and V27A mutant M2 channels of influenza A virus. Their antiviral activity and channel blocking ability were determined using cell-based assays and two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) technique on M2 channels, respectively. In addition, electrophysiology experiments revealed two interesting findings: (i) these inhibitors display a different behavior against the wild-type versus V27A mutant A/M2 channels, and (ii) the compounds display antiviral activity when they have kd equal or smaller than 10(-6) while they do not exhibit antiviral activity when kd is 10(-5) or higher although they may show blocking activity in the TEV assay. Thus, caution must be taken when predicting antiviral activity based on percent channel blockage in electrophysiological assays. These findings provide experimental evidence of the resistance mechanism of the V27A mutation to wild-type inhibitors, previously predicted in silico, offer an explanation for the lack of antiviral activity of compounds active in the TEV assay, and may help design new and more effective drugs.
