INTRODUCTION: Resistant bacteria are a well-known public health problem. This study was conducted to investigate the prevalence and genetic characteristics of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing enterobacteria, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) in mixed minced meat from pork and beef. METHODS: One hundred samples of mixed minced meat were collected from supermarkets (n = 70) and local butcher shops (n = 30) in the city of Graz (Austria). After enrichment and inoculation on selective media, bacteria were identified with MALDI-TOF MS or Vitek2 systems, tested for antibiotic resistance and further characterized with PCR and sequencing. RESULTS: In 20 of the 100 meat samples 24 ESBL positive Escherichia coli isolates were found. The most common ESBL among the isolates was CTX-M-1. Other detected bla genes contained CTX-M-14, CTX-M-32, SHV-12 and TEM-52 types. Nine samples were tested positive for MRSA and spa-typed. Detected spa-types were hospital-acquired t3928, as well as livestock-associated t011, t034 and t2241. No VRE were found. CONCLUSION: A contamination of meat with ESBL-producing E. coli and MRSA was confirmed in this study. The large diversity of ESBL producing E. coli could indicate a growing dissemination of ESBL genes in E. coli found in meat products from porcine and bovine origin.
