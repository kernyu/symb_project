Fluoridated hydroxyapatite (FHA) coating can help retard the degradation of magnesium, and possess good biocompatibility. However, the antibacterial property of FHA is very limited. In this work, we aimed to incorporate silver into FHA structure to fabricate biocompatible and antibacterial coatings with enhanced anticorrosion property. The results showed that the Ag-FHA coating prepared by electrochemical deposition and subsequent immersion in AgNO3 solution was superior to the Ag-FHA coating prepared by coelectrodeposition in terms of crystal structure, surface morphology and corrosion resistance. The release of Ag(+) ion causing high antiplanktonic bacterial rate and excellent antiadherence property to MRSA. Meanwhile, good cell compatibility of MC3T3-E1 including cell viability, cell adhesion, and cell morphology was achieved under the controlled degradation. The balance of degradation and antimicrobial property of Ag-incorporated FHA coating made it an alternative in the application of surface modification for biodegradable Mg.
