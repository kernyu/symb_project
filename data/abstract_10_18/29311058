Six imported pigs originating from Guangdong, Henan, and Hunan provinces in China during October 2015 to February 2017 were cultured and found to be positive for meropenem-resistant Escherichia coli The samples yielded 9 E. coli isolates of diverse sequence types carrying blaNDM-5 on IncX3 (8 isolates from 5 farms) or IncFII (1 isolate from 1 farm) plasmids. The mcr-1 gene was coharbored by 4 isolates. The IncX3 plasmids ( approximately 46 kb) carrying blaNDM-5 were identical or nearly identical to each other.
