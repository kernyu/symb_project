Traditional and quantitative PCR techniques were used to determine the occurrence and quantities of ARGs, including three types of genes resistant to sulfonamide, seven for tetracycline resistance and one for quinolone resistance, as well as one integron gene in typical aquaculture of the Pearl River Estuary. The results showed that all genes except for tetW were detectable in the aquaculture environment, and sull, sul2 and int1 were the most frequently detected genes (detectable percentage, 100% ). Relative abundances of ARGs increased with the prolongation of rearing time under the same aquaculture pattern, suggesting a cumulative effect. Moreover, the occurrences of ARGs in the ponds were different with different aquaculture patterns, indicating that the aquaculture pattern might play an important role in the abundances and distributions of ARGs. Relative abundances of intl, as a horizontal mobile genetic element, were significantly correlated to the levels of sull and the total ARGs (P < 0. 05). The total concentration of antibiotics exhibited a good positive correlation with the total concentration of ARGs in sediments (P <0. 05). All results elucidated that extensive residues of antibiotics in the aquaculture substantially increased the abundances of ARGs probably owning to the induction of horizontal gene transfer of ARGs among bacteria.
