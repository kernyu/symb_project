Santos is a Brazilian port city with high HIV incidence, high primary antiretroviral resistance levels, high HIV-1 BF recombinants prevalence, and high rates of antiretroviral virologic failure. We evaluated factors related to virologic failure after 48 weeks of HAART in this population. We compared demographic and HIV profiles among 43 individuals with virologic failure (group 1) and 37 with virologic success (group 2) after 48 weeks of HAART initiation. The overall primary antiretroviral resistance prevalence was 31.2%; 46.5% in group 1 and 13.5% in group 2 (p < 0.005). Nine patients from group 1 and seven from group 2 were infected by F or BF strains. Fifteen individuals presented with NRTI mutations, 13 with NNRTI mutations, three with PI mutations, and five with NRTI and NNRTI mutations. No significant differences were observed in baseline viral load, CD4, clade assignment, antiretrovirals used, or demographics among groups or patients harboring resistant versus wild-type viruses. In this region, there was a high prevalence of antiretroviral resistance among long standing infected patients whose disease had progressed. This finding supports the concept that resistance testing prior to ART initiation is cost effective. The association between primary antiretroviral resistance and virologic failure may suggest that primary resistance greatly impairs antiretroviral activity.
