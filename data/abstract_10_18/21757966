OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of long-term clarithromycin (CAM) treatment in adult Chinese patients suffering from chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSnNP). METHODS: Thirty-three CRSnNP patients were enrolled and subjected to CAM treatment for 12 weeks (250 mg daily). The total nasal symptom scores (TNSS), nasal resistance and inflammatory mediators including interleukin (IL)-8 and myeloperoxidase (MPO) were evaluated at weeks 0 and 12. Quality of life (QoL) was assessed in all patients by using the Sinonasal Outcome Test 20 and Short Form 36 questionnaires. RESULTS: CAM treatment significantly improved TNSS, nasal resistance and QoL, and it inhibited IL-8 and MPO production in CRSnNP patients (p < 0.05). CAM treatment was more effective for IL-8(high) CRSnNP patients than for IL-8(low) CRSnNP patients (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Long-term, low-dose CAM treatment is effective and safe for the treatment of CRSnNP in Chinese patients.
