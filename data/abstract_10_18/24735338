BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The clinical characteristics of patients with nosocomial pneumonia (NP) associated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection are not well characterized. METHODS: Three hundred and thirty-seven consecutive patients with MRSA isolation from respiratory specimens who attended our hospital between April 2007 and March 2011 were enrolled. Patients characteristics diagnosed with 'true' MRSA-NP were described with regards to clinical, microbiological features, radiological features and genetic characteristics of the isolates. The diagnosis of 'true' MRSA-NP was confirmed by anti-MRSA treatment effects, Gram-staining or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid culture. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were diagnosed with 'true' MRSA-NP, whereas 34 were diagnosed with NP with MRSA colonization. Patients with a MRSA-NP had a Pneumonia Patient Outcomes Research Team score of 5 (58.3% vs 23.5%), single cultivation of MRSA (83.3% vs 38.2%), MRSA quantitative cultivation yielding more than 10(6) CFU/mL (80.6% vs 47.1%), radiological findings other than lobar pneumonia (66.7% vs 26.5%), and a history of head, neck, oesophageal or stomach surgery (30.6% vs 11.8%). These factors were shown to be independent predictors of the pathogenicity of 'true' MRSA-NP by multivariate analysis (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: 'True' MRSA-NP shows distinct clinical and radiological features from NP with MRSA colonization.
