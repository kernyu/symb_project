Tubulins are the proposed target of anticancer drugs, anthelminthics, and fungicides. In Fusarium graminearum, beta2 tubulin has been reported to be the binding target of methyl benzimidazole carbamate (MBC) fungicides. However, the function of F. graminearum beta1 tubulin, which shares 76% amino acid sequence identity with beta2 tubulin, in MBC sensitivity has been unclear. In this study, MBC sensitivity relative to that of a parental strain (2021) was significantly reduced in a beta1 tubulin deletion strain but increased in a beta2 tubulin deletion strain, suggesting that beta1 tubulin was involved in the MBC sensitivity of F. graminearum. When strain 2021 was grown in a medium with a low or high concentration of the MBC fungicide carbendazim (0.5 or 1.4 mug/ml), the protein accumulation levels were reduced by 47 and 87%, respectively, for beta1 tubulin but only by 6 and 24%, respectively, for beta2 tubulin. This result was consistent with observations that MBC fungicides are more likely to disrupt beta1 tubulin microtubules rather than beta2 tubulin microtubules in GFP-beta tubulin fusion mutants in vivo. Furthermore, sequence analysis indicated that a difference in tubulin amino acid 240 (240L in beta1 versus 240F in beta2) may explain the difference in MBC binding affinity; this result was consistent with the result that an F240L mutation in beta2 tubulin greatly increased sensitivity to carbendazim in F. graminearum. We suggest that beta1 tubulin rather than beta2 tubulin is the preferred binding target for MBC fungicides in F. graminearum.
