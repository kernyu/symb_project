AIMS: To isolate phages against extensively drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (XDRAB) and characterize the highest lytic capability phage as a model to evaluate the potential on phage therapy. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eight phages were isolated from hospital sewage and showed narrow host spectrum. Phage phikm18p was able to effectively lyse the most XDRAB. It has a dsDNA genome of 45 kb in size and hexagonal head of about 59 nm in diameter and no tail. Bacterial population decreased quickly from 10(8) CFU ml(-1) to 10(3) CFU ml(-1) in 30 min by phikm18p. The 185 kDa lysis protein encoded by phikm18p genome was detected when the extracted protein did not boil before SDS-PAGE; it showed that the lysis protein is a complex rather than a monomer. Phage phikm18p improved human lung epithelial cells survival rates when they were incubated with A. baumannii. Combination of phages (phikm18p, phiTZ1 and phi314) as a cocktail could lyse all genotype-varying XDRAB isolates. CONCLUSION: Infections with XDRAB are extremely difficult to treat and development of a phage cocktails therapy could be a therapeutic alternative in the future. Phage phikm18p is a good candidate for inclusion in phage cocktails.
