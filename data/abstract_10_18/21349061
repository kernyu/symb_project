OBJECTIVE: To analyze risk factors for drug resistance in pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) inpatients. METHODS: Medical records of PTB inpatients in Chengdu Tuberculosis Hospital (CTH) from 2005 to 2007 were investigated retrospectively. A logistic regression model was used to analyze data. RESULTS: A total of 330 records were included in the analysis. A history of tuberculosis treatment was associated with drug resistance with odds ratio (OR) 16.79 and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) [10.14, 27.80] for all patients. Among new patients, the significant risk factor was duration of illness (OR 0.27, 95% CI [0.16, 0.46]), and for previously treated patients, risk factors included age (OR 0.96, 95% CI [0.93, 0.99]), improper initial chemotherapy (OR 3.85, 95% CI [1.59, 10.00]), and improper handling by medical staff (OR 3.44, 95% CI [1.32, 8.96]). CONCLUSIONS: A history of drug treatment is associated with drug resistance among PTB inpatients. Initial resistance becomes increasingly serious till 2007. To minimize the development of resistance, more personalized treatment and supervision should be used, and better training for medical staff is needed.
