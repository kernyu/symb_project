This study examined antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles in commensal Escherichia coli derived from healthy fattening pigs in Thai farms that used prophylactic antimicrobials (in-feed tiamulin fumarate and amoxicillin) [PAs], therapeutic antimicrobials (injectable enrofloxacin or gentamicin) [TAs], or no antimicrobials [NAs]. Commensal E. coli were used as a proxy for overall AMR on the farms. There was a high level of multidrug resistance in all three categories of farm, with isolates showing resistance to beta-lactams (amoxicillin, ampicillin, and piperacillin) and tetracyclines (tetracycline), and commonly possessing tetA, blaTEM, and plasmid replicons FIB and F. On the other hand, isolates with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase phenotype (ESBLP) and with resistance to aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, fluoroquinolones, nitrofurantoin, tiamulin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were significantly more common among the PA farms (p < 0.05) than in the other two farm categories. In the PA farms, ESBLP E. coli commonly contained the blaCTX-M-1 group, blaCTX-M-9 group, or both gene groups, and were shown to transfer blaCTX-M genes in a conjugation experiment. E. coli containing N, FIC and A/C replicons were found only in PA farms. In summary, although E. coli isolates from all farms contained a core set of resistance to beta-lactams and tetracyclines, the routine use of PA increased resistance rates to other important antimicrobials.
