This study investigated the cause of recent outbreaks of septicaemia in neonatal pigs in Australia (Victoria and Queensland). Septicaemia in neonatal pigs is commonly caused by enterotoxigenic E. coli, extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli and beta-haemolytic streptococci. Infrequent causes of septicaemia are Actinobacillus suis and Citrobacter freundii. Therefore, it was quite unexpected when Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated in predominant growth from multiple organs of pigs dying of septicaemia from six days of age. Two cases in Victoria were associated with multilocus sequence type 25 (ST25), whereas the cases on a single farm in Queensland were associated with two different sequence types (ST278 and ST1978). Similar outbreaks of septicaemia have also occurred in England, but all were associated with K. pneumoniae ST25. The K. pneumoniae sequence types did not cluster phylogenetically into groups of isolates from the same geographical location or into groups which caused either septicaemia or pneumonia. Antibiotic resistance also varied between isolates and showed neomycin resistance in Queensland. These results suggest that several sequence types of K. pneumoniae are involved in causing outbreaks of septicaemia in neonatal pigs, in addition to its previously recognised role in pneumonia and mastitis.
