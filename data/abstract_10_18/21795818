INTRODUCTION: Vibrio (V.) parahaemolyticus has endemically established in Chilean sea shores, causing outbreaks every year, with an important number of cases. In order to know the genetic relationship, genotype dominance and antibiotic resistance of isolates obtained from two outbreaks, this study characterized 110 strains isolated from environmental and clinical samples in years 2005 and 2007 in Chile. METHODOLOGY: Genotyping was performed by determination of PFGE profiles, and pandemic group and integrons were screened by PCR. Antimicrobial susceptibility was studied by the disk diffusion method. RESULTS: High antibiotic susceptibility frequency was found, mainly among 2007 isolates, except to ampicillin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefpodoxime, amikacin, streptomycin and kanamycin. Strains belonging to the pandemic group in clinical isolates account for 88% in 2005, decreasing to 66% in 2007 and among environmental isolates were detected in 20% of the strains from 2005, rising to 36% in 2007. In 2005, nine different PFGE profiles were identified, with 78% of the strains corresponding to a single clone. In 2007, sixteen different PFGE profiles were detected, with 61% of the strains included into a sole clone. The same clone was prevalent in both years. None of class 1, 2, 3 and SXT integrases genes was detected; however, the superintegron integrase gene (intIA) was present in almost all strains. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest the persistence and dominance of a unique PFGE clone of V. parahaemolyticus during 2005 and 2007, and the absence of genetic elements that capture antibiotic resistance genes described in other species of Vibrio.
