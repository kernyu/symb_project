BACKGROUND & AIMS: Helicobacter pylori have become resistant to antimicrobial agents, reducing eradication rates. A 10-day sequential regimen that contains levofloxacin was efficient, safe, and cost saving in eradicating H pylori infection in an area with high prevalence of clarithromycin resistance. We performed a noninferiority randomized trial to determine whether a 5-day levofloxacin-containing quadruple concomitant regimen was as safe and effective as the 10-day sequential regimen in eradicating H pylori in previously untreated patients. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients with H pylori infection to groups that were given 5 days of concomitant therapy (esomeprazole 40 mg twice daily, amoxicillin 1 g twice daily, levofloxacin 500 mg twice daily, and tinidazole 500 mg twice daily; n = 90) or 10 days of sequential therapy (esomeprazole 40 mg twice daily, amoxicillin 1g twice daily for 5 days followed by esomeprazole 40 mg twice daily, levofloxacin 500 mg twice daily, and tinidazole 500 mg twice daily for 5 more days; n = 90). Antimicrobial resistance was assessed by the E-test. Efficacy, adverse events, and costs were determined. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analysis showed similar eradication rates for concomitant (92.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 84.0%-95.8%) and sequential therapies (93.3%; 95% CI, 86.9%-97.3%). Per-protocol eradication results were 96.5% (95% CI, 91%-99%) for concomitant therapy and 95.5% for sequential therapy (95% CI, 89.6%-98.5%). The differences between sequential and concomitant treatments were 1.1% in the intention-to-treat study (95% CI; -7.6% to 9.8%) and -1.0% in the per-protocol analysis (95% CI; -8.0% to 5.9%). The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance and incidence of adverse events were comparable between groups. Concomitant therapy cost $9 less than sequential therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Five days of levofloxacin-containing quadruple concomitant therapy is as effective and safe, and less expensive, in eradicating H pylori infection than 10 days of levofloxacin-containing sequential therapy.
