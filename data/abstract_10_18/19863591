A qnrS2 gene was identified in an Aeromonas caviae isolate (MICs of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin >32 mg/L) from a stool sample collected from a patient with gastroenteritis. The analysis of the gyrA and parC genes revealed amino acid substitutions Ser83-Ile and Ser80-Thr, respectively. In addition, five out of 41 nalidixic acid-resistant Aeromonas isolates studied (26 identified as Aeromonas veronii bv sobria and 15 identified as A. caviae) showed ciprofloxacin resistance. The identification of plasmid-mediated qnr genes outside of the Enterobacteriaceae underlines a possible diffusion of these resistance determinants among Gram-negative rods. This emphasizes the importance of monitoring the emergence of these determinants as well as their dissemination among the Aeromonadaceae.
