Chip-based flow cytometry is a rather new method that offers an easy, fast opportunity for examination of yeasts, such as Candida cells. In our study cell-chip technology was tested with ATCC Candida strains to determine their viability and susceptibility against antifungal agents, amphotericin B and fluconazole. We found this technology to be suitable for the detection of Candida cells, for the differentiation between dead and living cells, and for the determination of amphotericin B and fluconazole susceptibility of different Candida strains (Bouquet et al., Mycoses 55:e90-e96, 2012).
