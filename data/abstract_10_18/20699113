The effect of device geometry and film characteristics on the performance of several passive flutter-induced dispersion DPI prototypes was investigated. Device resistance measurements indicated that the type of films, type of device geometry and specific device dimensions significantly affects the airflow resistance of the device. It was found that airflow resistance was positively correlated to the turbulence generated within the device. In addition, in vitro deposition studies indicated that the device geometry and film properties have a significant effect on aerosol dispersion performance. From these studies, selected prototypes were observed to have improved aerosolization performance without significant increases in device resistance. With further device design optimization, flutter induced dispersion DPI may be highly efficient mechanism for drug deaggregation and aerosolization.
