BACKGROUND: Resistance to mericitabine (prodrug of HCV NS5B polymerase inhibitor PSI-6130) is rare and conferred by the NS5B S282T mutation. METHODS: Serum HCV RNA from patients who experienced viral breakthrough, partial response, or nonresponse in 2 clinical trials in which patients received mericitabine plus peginterferon alfa-2a (40KD)/ribavirin were analyzed by population and clonal sequence analysis as well as phenotypic assay for assessment of in vivo mericitabine resistance. RESULTS: Among 405 patients treated with mericitabine plus peginterferon alfa-2a/ribavirin in PROPEL and JUMP-C, virologic breakthrough or nonresponse were not observed; 12 patients experienced a partial response. The NS5B S282T resistance mutation was not observed in any patient. A number of treatment-associated NS5B changes were observed and characterized. A novel double mutant (L159F/L320F) with impaired replication capacity was detected in one HCV genotype 1b-infected patient. Introduction of double mutant L159F/L320F into genotype 1a (H77) and 1b (Con-1) replicons, respectively, increased the EC50 for mericitabine by 3.1- and 5.5-fold and the EC90 by 3.1- and 8.9-fold. The double mutant also decreased susceptibility to sofosbuvir (GS-7977) and GS-938 but not setrobuvir, relative to wild-type. CONCLUSIONS: A novel and replication-deficient double mutation (L159F/L320F) confers low-level resistance to mericitabine and cross-resistance to both sofosbuvir and GS-938.
