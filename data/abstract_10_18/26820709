PURPOSE: In this study, we discuss a mechanism of development of access-related Staphylococcus aureus infections in patients on buttonhole (BH) method and logically construct a measure to prevent such infections on the basis of the mechanism. SUMMARY: S. aureus can colonize a BH track. Once S. aureus colonizes a BH track, access-related infections may develop when the equilibrium is upset between the factors of host resistance and a level of bacterial growth in a BH track. Thus, the logically constructed measure to prevent access-related infections are as follows: (1) decolonization of S. aureus from a BH track by applying mupirocin ointment to a BH entry site when a patient has been proven to be a carrier of S. aureus in the track, (2) prevention of bacterial invasion of the BH track by a new method to remove a scab completely, and (3) control of bacterial growth in the BH track by disinfecting the site with diluted povidone-iodine solution (0.1% povidone-iodine solution) before access vessel cannulation.
