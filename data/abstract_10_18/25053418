Effects of glucose on the susceptibility of antifungal agents were investigated against Candida spp. Increasing the concentration of glucose decreased the activity of antifungal agents; voriconazole was the most affected drugs followed by amphotericin B. No significant change has been observed for anidulafungin. Biophysical interactions between antifungal agents with glucose molecules were investigated using isothermal titration calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared, and (1)H NMR. Glucose has a higher affinity to bind with voriconazole by hydrogen bonding and decrease the susceptibility of antifungal agents during chemotherapy. In addition to confirming the results observed in vitro, theoretical docking studies demonstrated that voriconazole presented three important hydrogen bonds and amphotericin B presented two hydrogen bonds that stabilized the glucose. In vivo results also suggest that the physiologically relevant higher glucose level in the bloodstream of diabetes mellitus mice might interact with the available selective agents during antifungal therapy, thus decreasing glucose activity by complex formation. Thus, proper selection of drugs for diabetes mellitus patients is important to control infectious diseases.
