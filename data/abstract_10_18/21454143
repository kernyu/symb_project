INTRODUCTION: Infections due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are increasing worldwide. The clinical spectrum of the disease ranges from nasal colonization to superficial and invasive infections. OBJECTIVES: To describe the frequency, clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with MRSA disease in children under 15 years old. To establish the prevalence of colonization and antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective study. Included subjects; aged 1 month to 15 years old treated in the Hospital del Nino in Panama with invasive or superficial infection by S. aureus in the period from June 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010. Carrier status was assessed by performing nasal swabs. Demographic, clinical features, treatment of disease and antimicrobial resistance patterns. RESULTS: A total of 146 subjects were collected with S.aureus infections, of which 8.9% (13/146) were infected by MRSA. Community-acquired MRSA accounted for 38.5% of the isolates. We did not identify any risk factors for developing MRSA infections. The prevalence of nasal carriage was 8.3%. The resistance rates to erythromycin and clindamycin were 15.4%. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of MRSA infections was low compared with other regions. We recommend active surveillance in order to establish measures to prevent nosocomial infections and treatment guidelines based on local epidemiological criteria.
