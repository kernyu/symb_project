Scopulariopsisis an emerging opportunistic fungus characterized by its high resistance to antifungal therapies. We have developed a murine model of disseminated infection in immunosuppressed animals by intravenous inoculation ofScopulariopsis brevicaulisandScopulariopsis brumptii, the most clinically relevant species, in order to evaluate their virulence and their responses to conventional antifungal treatments. Survival and tissue burden studies showed thatS. brumptiiwas more virulent thanS. brevicaulis The three drugs tested, liposomal amphotericin B, posaconazole, and voriconazole, prolonged the survival of mice infected withS. brumptii, but none showed efficacy againstS. brevicaulis The different therapies were only able to modestly reduce the fungal burden of infected tissue; however, in general, despite the high serum levels reached, they showed poor efficacy in the treatment of the infection. Unfortunately, the most effective therapy forScopulariopsisinfections remains unresolved.
