The management of infections with New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM)-producing bacteria remains clinically challenging given the multidrug resistant (MDR) phenotype associated with these bacteria. Despite resistance in vitro, ceftazidime-avibactam previously demonstrated in vivo activity against NDM-positive Enterobacteriaceae Herein, we observed in vitro synergy with ceftazidime-avibactam and aztreonam against an MDR Klebsiella pneumoniae harboring NDM. In vivo, humanized doses of ceftazidime-avibactam monotherapy resulted in >2 log10 CFU bacterial reduction; therefore, no in vivo synergy was observed.
