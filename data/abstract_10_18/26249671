BACKGROUND: Raltegravir (RAL) plus tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) is a recommended initial antiretroviral regimen. A substantial proportion of persons diagnosed with HIV infection and starting antiretrovirals in the U.S. are African-American (AA); however, the effects of this regimen on metabolic parameters have largely been studied in white patients. METHODS: Single-arm, open-label study of untreated AA HIV-infected patients administered RAL with TDF/FTC for 104 weeks. Changes in fasting lipids, insulin resistance, visceral adipose tissue (VAT), abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), limb and trunk fat, and bone mineral density (BMD) were assessed at weeks 56 and 104. RESULTS: Thirty (85% men) participants were included. Median entry characteristics included age of 38 years, CD4 323 cells/mm3, HIV RNA level 29,245 copies/ml, and body mass index 28.1 kg/m2. At 56 and 104 weeks, significant increases in VAT, trunk fat, limb fat, and overall fat were observed. Bone mineral density decreased by 1.5% by week 104.There were no significant changes in non-HDL-cholesterol, fasting triglycerides, or insulin resistance. A median CD4 cell count increase of 318 cells/mm3 (IQR 179, 403; full range 40, 749) (P<0.001) was observed. Assuming missing=failure, 78 and 70% had HIV RNA levels<40 copies/ml at weeks 56 and 104, respectively. There were no treatment-related discontinuations and no new antiretroviral resistance mutations were detected. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of AAs, initiation of RAL with TDF/FTC was associated with significant general increases in fat. Significant changes in lipids or insulin resistance were not observed and there was a small decline in BMD. Therapy was well tolerated and effective. These results are consistent with findings of studies of initial antiretroviral therapy in racially diverse cohorts and inform treatment selection for AA patients starting therapy for HIV infection.
