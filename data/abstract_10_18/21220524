The exposure of Staphylococcus aureus to a broad range of cell wall-damaging agents triggers the induction of a cell wall stress stimulon (CWSS) controlled by the VraSR two-component system. The vraSR genes form part of the four-cistron autoregulatory operon orf1-yvqF-vraS-vraR. The markerless inactivation of each of the genes within this operon revealed that orf1 played no observable role in CWSS induction and had no influence on resistance phenotypes for any of the cell envelope stress-inducing agents tested. The remaining three genes were all essential for the induction of the CWSS, and mutants showed various degrees of increased susceptibility to cell wall-active antibiotics. Therefore, the role of YvqF in S. aureus appears to be opposite that in other Gram-positive bacteria, where YvqF homologs have all been shown to inhibit signal transduction. This role, as an activator rather than repressor of signal transduction, corresponds well with resistance phenotypes of DeltaYvqF mutants, which were similar to those of DeltaVraR mutants in which CWSS induction also was completely abolished. Resistance profiles of DeltaVraS mutants differed phenotypically from those of DeltaYvqF and DeltaVraR mutants on many non-ss-lactam antibiotics. DeltaVraS mutants still became more susceptible than wild-type strains at low antibiotic concentrations, but they retained larger subpopulations that were able to grow on higher antibiotic concentrations than DeltaYvqF and DeltaVraR mutants. Subpopulations of DeltaVraS mutants could grow on even higher glycopeptide concentrations than wild-type strains. The expression of a highly sensitive CWSS-luciferase reporter gene fusion was up to 2.6-fold higher in a DeltaVraS than a DeltaVraR mutant, which could be linked to differences in their respective antibiotic resistance phenotypes. Bacterial two-hybrid analysis indicated that the integral membrane protein YvqF interacted directly with VraS but not VraR, suggesting that it plays an essential role in sensing the as-yet unknown trigger of CWSS induction.
