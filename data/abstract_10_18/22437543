Changes in udder health and antibiotic resistance of mastitis pathogens isolated from dairies upon conversion from conventional to organic management over a 3-year period was studied. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) were the most prevalent mastitis pathogens isolated. CNS were significantly less resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics when isolated from milk after the herd transitioned to organic management. Cessation of the use of antimicrobial therapies in dairies in combination with organic management could lead to a reduction in the antimicrobial resistance of mastitis pathogens.
