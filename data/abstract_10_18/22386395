OBJECTIVE: To test our hypothesis that a targeted rectal screening protocol before transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy would potentiate streamlined prophylaxis, thereby reducing postbiopsy infectious rates while minimizing unnecessary broad-spectrum antibiotic use. To this end, we instituted preprocedure rectal cultures in an effort to identify fluoroquinolone (FQ)- resistant flora using selective media to optimally direct targeted prophylactic antibiotic administration. The inexorably increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant microorganisms, notably extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL)-producing and FQ-resistant Enterobacteriaceae has increased the post-TRUS prostatic biopsy infection rates, including life-threatening sepsis. METHODS: A total of 235 rectal swabs were obtained and plated directly onto MacConkey agar plates containing 10-mug/mL ciprofloxacin. Following the screening procedure, antimicrobial susceptibility results were used to develop a customized antibiotic prophylaxis regimen to be administered before biopsy. Following the biopsy procedure, the patients were seen in follow-up within 7 days, and information was gathered on potential adverse effects, clinical appointments for infections, and potential antibiotics received. RESULTS: Thirty-two-patients (14%) had FQ-resistant isolates (most Escherichia coli), and 3 (1.3%) were ESBL-producing isolates. There were no infectious complications identified in this period, (compared with 3 septic complications among 103 biopsies in the 4 months preceding the study). CONCLUSION: Rectal cultures obtained before TRUS biopsy, using selective media to identify FQ-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, facilitate targeted antibiotic prophylaxis, and appear to be highly efficacious in reducing infectious complications.
