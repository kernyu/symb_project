Enteric fever is a public health problem with the upsurge in the occurrence of Salmonella isolates that are resistant to ciprofloxacin. In this study, a total of 284 blood culture isolates of S. Paratyphi A were investigated. Of these isolates, 281 (98.9%) were nalidixic acid resistant. A high rate (6.3%) of high-level resistance (>/= 4 mug/mL) was found to ciprofloxacin. The isolates with ciprofloxacin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of >/= 12 mug/mL had 4 mutations, 2 mutations within the quinolone resistance-determining region of gyrA and 2 mutations also in parC. According to the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute 2012 MIC breakpoints, 75.0% of isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Finally, 3 major pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns were observed among the S. Paratyphi A isolates. The spread of fluoroquinolone resistant S. Paratyphi A necessitates a change toward 'evidence-based' treatment for enteric fever. The research provides a perspective on the increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistant S. Paratyphi A isolates in this region of India.
