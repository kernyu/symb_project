Considering the importance of target spot, caused by the fungus Corynespora cassiicola, to reduce soybean yield in Brazil and that more basic information regarding the soybean-C. cassiicola interaction is needed, the present study aimed to investigate whether the cellular damage caused by C. cassiicola infection could activate the antioxidant system and whether a more efficient antioxidant system could be associated with an increase in soybean resistance to target spot. The activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase as well as the concentrations of ascorbate (AsA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide (O2*-), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured in soybean plants from two cultivars differing in resistance to the pathogen. The number of lesions per square centimeter was significantly reduced by 14% in plants from cultivar Fundacep 59 compared with plants from cultivar TMG 132. The area under the disease progress curve was significantly lower, by 15%, in plants from Fundacep 59 than in plants from TMG 132. Generally, antioxidant enzyme activities and AsA concentration significantly increased in response to C. cassiicola infection in plants from both cultivars, however more prominent increases were recorded for plants from Fundacep 59. The concentrations of MDA, H2O2, and O2*- also increased, particularly for plants from TMG 132. The results from this study highlight the importance of a more efficient antioxidative system in the removal of reactive oxygen species generated in soybean plants during C. cassiicola infection, contributing to the resistance to target spot.
