High expression levels of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor were found in the leukemic cells of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with t(8;21). Therapeutic significance of G-CSF receptor on chemotherapy remains to be defined. We evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of CAG regimen, consisting of concurrent use of G-CSF with low-dose cytarabine and aclarubicin, in 36 refractory/relapsed AML patients with t(8;21). The overall complete remission (CR) rate was 75% and median CR duration was 12 months. No significant treatment-related adverse events were observed. These data demonstrate that CAG regimen might be an alternative option in the treatment of AML with t(8;21), especially in older patients or patients with co-morbidities.
