Ambler position 105 in class A beta-lactamases is implicated in resistance to clavulanic acid, although no clinical isolates with mutations at this site have been reported. We hypothesized that Y105 is important in resistance to clavulanic acid because changes in positioning of the inhibitor for ring oxygen protonation could occur. In addition, resistance to bicyclic 6-methylidene penems, which are interesting structural probes that inhibit all classes of serine beta-lactamases with nanomolar affinity, might emerge with substitutions at position 105, especially with nonaromatic substitutions. All 19 variants of SHV-1 with variations at position 105 were prepared. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that Escherichia coli DH10B expressing Y105 variants retained activity against ampicillin, except for the Y105L variant, which was susceptible to all beta-lactams, similar to the case for the host control strain. Several variants had elevated MICs to ampicillin-clavulanate. However, all the variants remained susceptible to piperacillin in combination with a penem inhibitor (MIC, </=2/4 mg/liter). The Y105E, -F, -M, and -R variants demonstrated reduced catalytic efficiency toward ampicillin compared to the wild-type (WT) enzyme, which was caused by increased K(m). Clavulanic acid and penem K(i) values were also increased for some of the variants, especially Y105E. Mutagenesis at position 105 in SHV yields mutants resistant to clavulanate with reduced catalytic efficiency for ampicillin and nitrocefin, similar to the case for the class A carbapenemase KPC-2. Our modeling analyses suggest that resistance is due to oxyanion hole distortion. Susceptibility to a penem inhibitor is retained although affinity is decreased, especially for the Y105E variant. Residue 105 is important to consider when designing new inhibitors.
