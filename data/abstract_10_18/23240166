Streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the most important human pathogens. It represents the most frequent cause of pneumonia, meningitis, sinusitis and otitis. After the PCV7 vaccine introduction, a serotypic switch was noticed. This phenomenon led to the replacement of the seven serotypes contained in the vaccine with other less common ones, some of which are invasive or characterised by antibiotic-resistance. This replacement is only partially due to the vaccination. Many causes have been suggested to explain this effect: apearance of new serotypes, diffusion of minority serotypes and replacement of common serotypes due to natural secular trend. Pneumococcus has a promiscuous "sex life", characterized by homologous recombinations within the same species and also between different species. This fact can unlock the secret of how these pathogens can develop antibiotic or vaccine-resistance. The serotypic switch involves big loci that are responsible for capsular polysaccharide synthesis. The most important region of the genome involved in this process is near the gene tetM. The same mechanisms are also responsible for antibiotic resistance. In recent years the growth of penicillin, macrolides and clindamycine resistance has been noticed. It is also important to underline that multidrug-resistant bacteria isolation has increased. In conclusion, to obtain more information about bacteria composition and evolution, antibiotic-resistance and vaccine response, it is fundamental to improve the epidemiological surveillance of pneumococcal infections using modern molecular diagnostic techinques.
