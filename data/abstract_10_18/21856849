The path of substrates in the multidrug efflux pump AcrB of Escherichia coli was examined by using labeling with a lipophilic substrate mimic, Bodipy FL maleimide. Four (out of eight) residues in the vestibule bound the dye, suggesting its role in substrate transport, whereas only one (out of nine) residue in the central cavity tested positive.
