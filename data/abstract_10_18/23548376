BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus saprophyticus is the second most frequent community-acquired causative agent of urinary tract infection (UTI). The objective of this study was to evaluate the susceptibility profile and resistance detection in Staphylococcus species. isolated from patients with UTI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The isolates were investigated using the disk diffusion method, Vitek I system, E-test(R), and detection of the mecA gene. RESULTS: Most isolates (76.2%) were resistant to oxacillin by the disk diffusion method, followed by those resistant to penicillin (72.2%). The oxacillin disk diffusion method, E-test, and Vitek I method showed higher sensitivity (94.4%) and lower specificity (28.9, 26.5, and 24.0%, respectively) than the cefoxitin disk diffusion test (sensitivity: 83.5%, specificity: 85.5%) for the detection of oxacillin resistance. CONCLUSIONS: The large number of oxacillin-resistant isolates indicates that the breakpoint value recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute may overestimate oxacillin resistance in S. saprophyticus. Thus, changes in these guidelines are necessary for the correct detection of this resistance.
