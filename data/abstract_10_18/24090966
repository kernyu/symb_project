BACKGROUND: Non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli (NFGNB) are an emerging problem in neonatal sepsis. A major concern is multi-drug resistance which severely limits treatment options. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: A retrospective observational study was conducted to analyse the role of non-fermenters in neonatal sepsis over a 4-year period, the factors leading to this trend and the pattern of antibiotic resistance. METHODS: Demographic and clinical data were collected for all neonates with blood culture-positive sepsis during the study period, January 2007 to December 2010. RESULTS: Blood cultures were positive in 186 (13%) of 1402 neonates, in 44 (32.1%) of whom the cause was NFGNB. Acinetobacter spp was the most common organism (n = 30). Infection by NFGNB showed a steady increase (P<0.0001), and was fairly evenly distributed between early- and late-onset sepsis. The infection rate was significantly higher in inborn neonates (P = 0.04) and those delivered vaginally (P = 0.002). Multi-drug resistance (MDR) occurred in 50% and carbapenem resistance in 30% of Acinetobacter spp isolates. In five cases there was panresistance of Acinetobacter spp to all antibiotics tested. CONCLUSION: The trend of increasing numbers of cases of NFGNB in neonatal sepsis compounded by MDR is of great concern. It is necessary to administer antibiotics judiciously, strengthen surveillance and laboratory services in neonatal intensive care units, and re-evaluate treatment guidelines for management of infection by these organisms.
