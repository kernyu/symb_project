Removal of proteins on an essential pathway of a pathogen is expected to prohibit the pathogen from performing a vital function. To disrupt these pathways, we consider a cut set S of simple graph G, where G representing the PPI network of the pathogen. After removing S, if the difference of sizes of two partitions is high, the probability of existence of a functioning pathway is increased. We need to partition the graph into balanced partitions and approximate it with spectral bipartitioning. We consider two scenarios: in the first, we do not have any information on drug targets; in second, we consider information on drug targets. Our databases are E. coli and C. jejuni. In the first scenario, 20% and 17% of proteins in cut of E. coli and C. jejuni are drug targets and in the second scenario 53% and 63% of proteins in cut are drug targets respectively.
