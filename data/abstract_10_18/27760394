Haemonchus contortus is one of the most important parasitic nematodes of small ruminants around the world, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. The control of haemonchosis relies mainly on anthelmintics, but the excessive and prolonged use of anthelmintics is causing serious drug resistance issues in many countries. As benzimidazole (BZ) anthelmintics have been broadly used in China, we hypothesized that resistance is widespread. Given the link between three known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, designated F167Y, E198A and F200Y) in the isotype-1 beta-tubulin gene and BZ resistance, our goal here was to explore the presence of these mutations in H. contortus from small ruminants (sheep and goats) from eight provinces in China using PCR-coupled sequencing. In addition, the genetic diversity and genetic relationship of isotype-1 beta-tubulin sequence haplotypes were also investigated. Among 192 H. contortus adult individuals representing the eight populations, we identified six distinct sequence types, five of which had SNP E198A (GCA) and/or F200Y (TAC). Sequence analysis showed that the frequencies of SNPs E198A and F200Y were 0-70% and 0-31%, respectively. SNP F167Y (TAC) was not detected in any population. In addition, high haplotype diversities (0.455-0.939) and nucleotide diversities (0.018-0.039) were calculated. A network analysis of the isotype-1 beta-tubulin gene sequences showed that SNPs E198A and F200Y occurred in multiple distinct groupings, suggesting multiple independent origins of these SNPs. The findings of this first study of SNPs in the isotype-1 beta-tubulin gene of H. contortus populations suggest that BZ resistance is prevalent in some regions of China, and that any control strategy might focus on monitoring BZ resistance in this country.
