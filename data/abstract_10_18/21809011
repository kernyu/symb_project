Multidrug-resistant (MDR) gram-negative bacteria-related nosocomial infections and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) presents an emerging challenge to clinicians. Older antimicrobial agents such as colistin have become life-saving drugs because of the susceptibility of these pathogens. We report our experience with aerosolized colistin in two preterm and one term neonate with Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa-related VAP who were unresponsiveness to previous antimicrobial treatment. All pathogens were isolated from tracheal aspirate. We used 5 mg/kg (base activity) aerosolized colistin methanesulfonate sodium in every 12 h as an adjunctive therapy for VAP. VAP was treated by 14, 14, and 16-day courses of aerosolized colistin in these patients, respectively. No adverse effect such as nephrotoxicity or neurotoxicity was observed. We found that aerosolized colistin was tolerable and safe, and it may be an adjunctive treatment option for MDR gram-negative bacterial VAP in neonates. Further studies are needed to determine appropriate doses for aerosolized colistin and its eligibility as an alternative treatment choice in newborns.
