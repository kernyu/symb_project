In the last years, Enterobacteriaceae such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli, have acquired resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (C3G) because of the presence of plasmid-mediated AmpC ss-lactamases. The aim of this work was to detect plasmid AmpC enzymes and to investigate the predominant types in our region. Between March and July 2009, 733 consecutive isolates of Enterobacteriaceae derived from hospitals and outpatient centers were studied. Susceptibility testing was performed by disk diffusion; one P. mirabilis and three E. coli strains showed resistance to cephamycins (cefoxitin) and C3G. An E-test to determine MIC and a synergy test by aminophenylboronic disks were performed. Enzymatic activity against cefoxitin was confirmed by a microbiological assay. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of plasmid-mediated ampC genes of different groups was performed and a 462-bp amplicon was obtained when using primers directed against the CIT group; the obtained sequences were compared to blaCMY-2 sequences, showing 100% identity. The emergence of CMY-2-type plasmid-mediated AmpC ss-lactamases indicated the importance of implementing systematic monitoring of these resistances to avoid potential clinical and epidemiological consequences.
