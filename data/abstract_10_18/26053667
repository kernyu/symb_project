The ABC transporter Cdr1 protein (Cdr1p) of Candida albicans, which plays a major role in antifungal resistance, has two transmembrane domains (TMDs) and two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) that are interconnected by extracellular (ECLs) and intracellular (ICLs) loops. To examine the communication interface between the NBDs and ICLs of Cdr1p, we subjected all four ICLs to alanine scanning mutagenesis, replacing each of the 85 residues with an alanine. The resulting ICL mutant library was analyzed by biochemical and phenotypic mapping. Only 18% of the mutants from this library displayed enhanced drug susceptibility. Most of the drug-susceptible mutants displayed uncoupling between ATP hydrolysis and drug transport. The two drug-susceptible ICL1 mutants (I574A and S593A) that lay within or close to the predicted coupling helix yielded two chromosomal suppressor mutations that fall near the Q-loop of NBD2 (R935) and in the Walker A motif (G190) of NBD1. Based on a 3D homology model and kinetic analysis of drug transport, our data suggest that large distances between ICL residues and their respective chromosomal suppressor mutations rule out a direct interaction between them. However, they impact the transport cycle by restoring the coupling interface via indirect downstream signaling.
