Chemical investigation of the fungus Talaromyces stipitatus ATCC 10500, whose genome has been sequenced, led to the isolation of four undescribed talaroenamines B-E along with the known talaroenamine A. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic studies including mass spectrometry, extensive 2D NMR and electronic circular dichroism (ECD). Interestingly, talaroenamine A had previously been isolated from the strain of T. stipitatus Deltatrop C, a strain knocked out for the gene encoding a non-heme Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenase catalyzing the oxidative ring expansion leading to the tropolone, but never from a wild-type strain. All talaroenamines were evaluated for their antiplasmodial activity and Talaroenamine D exhibited the best inhibition against the chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum (FcB1 strain) without noticeable toxicity on HeLa and preadipose cell lines. In the course of the chemical investigation of T. stipitatus, an undescribed polyester was also isolated and its absolute configuration was determined by hydrolysis and transesterification followed by gas chromatography on chiral column.
