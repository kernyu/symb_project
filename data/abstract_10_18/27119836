In this article, there are given data of microorganisms sensitivity/resistancy investigation, to different groups of antibiotics. Microorganisms where isolated from puerperas, newborns and samples of maternity ward environment. Investigation was performed in L.T.D. "Imedis Clinica". Detection of microorganisms sensitivity/resistancy to antibiotics was performed by use of two methods: method of disc diffusion and serial dilution on solid breeding substratum. It was determined that gram positive, as well as gram negative microorganisms had sufficiently high level of resistancy to some penicillines, aminoglycosides, macrolides. Some species of gram negative microorganisms had resistancy to lincomicin in 100% of cases. High level of sensitivity was revealed to such antibiotics as amicalin, amoxiclav, cefepim, ciprofloxacin. Gram negative microorganisms had high level of sensitivity to imipenem-cilastatin and meropenem. Performed investigation confirms necessity of microbiological monitoring in different clinics, because it is one of the most significant components of infection control. It gives opportunity to perform exact antibiotic prophylaxis and if necessary - rational antibiotic therapy.
