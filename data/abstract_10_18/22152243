OBJECTIVE: To investigate the evolution of hepatitis B virus (HBV) quasispecies in one patient during lamivudine (LAM) monotherapy and switching to entecavir (ETV) rescue treatment. METHODS: Serum samples were taken at seven different time points during antiviral therapy (0, 24, 48, 60, 72, 96, 152 weeks, respectively), the HBV DNA polymerase gene was amplified, cloned and sequenced to analyze the amino acid substitutions within HBV DNA polymerase gene and distribution of virus quasispecies. Quantitative detection of the HBV wild strains and total virus was performed by amplification refractory mutation system real-time PCR (ARMS-PCR). RESULTS: Three mutation patterns detected during antiviral therapy in the patient: rtM204V, rtM204V+rtL180M and rtM204I. The HBV quasispecies were found always in dynamic variation. The HBV populations were completely replaced with the LAM-resistant variants when the viral breakthrough was encountered during LAM monotherapy. Interestingly, the wild-type variants presented gradually dominant (79.3%) with the decline of HBV DNA load after switching to ETV rescue administration. ARMS-PCR results showed that the wild-type variants account ed for 68.55% of the HBV populations at baseline and this proportion declined to 0.21% when the viral breakthrough emerged under LAM therapy. The wild-type variants gradually increased from week 24 after switching to ETV rescue therapy and the proportion of HBV wild-type variants in the population fluctuated between 16.01% to 26.93%. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of virus quasispecies were always in dynamic variation during sequential therapy with nucleotide analogs in chronic hepatitis B patients. Different patterns of dynamic HBV quasispecies may have different contribution in ETV resistance in LMV refractory patients with ETV administration.
