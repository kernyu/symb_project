UNLABELLED: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) drug development has resulted in treatment regimens composed of interferon-free, all-oral combinations of direct-acting antivirals. While the new regimens are potent and highly efficacious, the full clinical impact of HCV drug resistance, its implications for retreatment, and the potential role of baseline resistance testing remain critical research and clinical questions. In this report, we discuss the viral proteins targeted by HCV direct-acting antivirals and summarize clinically relevant resistance data for compounds that have been approved or are currently in phase 3 clinical trials. CONCLUSION: This report provides a comprehensive, systematic review of all resistance information available from sponsors' trials as a tool to inform the HCV drug development field.
