Reversing the spread of HIV infection and the incidence of malaria constitute two of the Millenium Development Goals. However, despite recent achievements, both diseases still entail global heath problems. Furthermore, their overlapping geographical distribution raises concerns and challenges for potential immunological, clinical and therapeutic interactions. It has been reported that HIV infection increases malaria susceptibility and reduces the efficacy of antimalarial drugs. On the other hand, the effect of malaria on HIV-infected individuals has also been explored, with the parasitic infection increasing the risk of HIV disease progression and mother-to-child transmission of HIV. The spread of malaria and parasite resistance to antimalarials could also be accelerated by HIV-associated immunosuppresion. Current knowledge of the epidemiological, clinical, immunological and therapeutic interactions of the two diseases is reviewed in this article. We focus on the latest available data, pointing out key future research areas and challenges of the field.
