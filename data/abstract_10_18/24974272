This study evaluated pneumococci cultured from blood or lower respiratory tract specimens from hospitalized patients in the USA (all age groups) during 2011-2012 (N = 1190) and compared findings with those from a similar study performed in 2008 (N = 694). Isolates were tested for susceptibility by broth microdilution and serotypes determined by cpsB sequencing, supplemented with multiplex PCR and capsular swelling assays. Relative percentages of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) types were 6.3 and 4.9% in 2008 and 2011-2012, respectively, and the most common PCV7 serotypes (19F and 6B) comprised only 3.7% and 4.0% of all isolates from both periods, respectively. Thirteen-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) serotypes represented 42.9% of isolates in 2008 and 30.1% in the second period, and this decrease was driven by 19A and 7F. Non-PCV13 serogroups/serotypes 23A, 15B/15C, 7C, 8, and 31 increased. Penicillin non-susceptibility rates were 9.6-10.0% and 38.9-42.7% when applying the parenteral (i.e. >/= 4 mug/mL) and oral breakpoints (i.e. >/= 0.12 mug/mL), respectively. Ceftaroline was the most potent agent tested based on MIC50 and MIC90 values (</= 0.015 and 0.12 mug/mL, respectively) for both time periods.
