This work characterizes MLS(b) resistance in 39 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and 32 Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) isolates. Of 21 erm(A) gene encoding MRSA isolates, 71.4% carried SCCmecIII, whereas of 12 isolates carrying the erm(C) gene, 83.3% carried SCCmecIV. Among the 25 MRSE isolates positive for the erm(C) gene, 80% had SCCmecIV or nontypeable cassettes. Isolates carrying these genes had MIC(90) >/= 256 mug/mL to erythromycin and clindamycin. The msr(A) gene was associated with a low MIC(90) to these drugs. The erm(A) gene was associated with SCCmecIII in MRSA isolates, whereas the erm(C) gene was associated with SCCmecIV in both MRSA and MRSE isolates.
