Antimicrobial surveillance systems in Denmark (DANMAP), The Netherlands (MARAN), Spain (VAV) and Sweden (SVARM) as well as the European Antimicrobial Susceptibility Surveillance in Animals (EASSA) were reviewed. Data have been considered for extended-spectrum cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and macrolides against food-borne and commensal bacteria. The greatest challenge arises from the lack of agreement between programmes on what is meant by resistance through the use of different interpretive criteria. Indeed, it is shown here that the extent of the differences depends on the antibacterial compound being investigated, the methodology and the interpretive criteria used. This emphasises a need to agree a definition for resistance and for epidemiological cut-off values and to consider harmonising the antimicrobials used in surveillance. This analysis of the data highlights the usefulness of using both epidemiological cut-off values and clinical resistance breakpoints for the purpose of detection of decreased susceptibility and development of clinical resistance, respectively. It is concluded that harmonisation in resistance monitoring programmes is needed since there is potential for data to be appropriately used within risk analysis, providing the opportunity to implement appropriate risk management steps as a response to the public health issues arising from changes in antibiotic resistance in food-borne pathogens and commensal organisms.
