INTRODUCTION: Antimicrobial resistance is one of the biggest problems facing global public health. The emergence of resistant clinical and environmental strains worsens the situation. Among the microorganisms with antimicrobial resistance, Escherichia coil species stands out due to its dual role as fecal contamination indicator and pathogen. OBJECTIVES: To isolate and identify Escherichia coil isolates from water samples from polluted rivers located in La Habana, and to determine their antimicrobial in vitro susceptibility. METHODS: One hundred thirteen isolates of coliform bacteria isolated from 10 sampling stations in the capital's urban areas near Almendares, Quibu and Luyano rivers were studied in the period of February 2008 to June 2010. The identification of isolates, the determination of antimicrobial susceptibility and the search for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase were all performed using VITEK automated method. RESULTS: One hundred thirteen environmental strains of Escherichia coli were identified. It showed that 23% of the isolates were resistant to at least one of the tested antimicrobials. The highest percentages of resistance were observed to ampicilline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of E. coil isolates with multiple antimicrobial resistances in these rivers clearly indicates the biological risk involving the use of their waters.
