AIM OF THE STUDY: To estimate the percentage of empirical treatments adapted in the bloodstream infections of community and not community origin and to determine the main circumstances in which this initial treatment is not adapted. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Surveillance of bloodstream infections from the laboratories of microbiology of the eight hospitals of the Ile-de-France network, during year 2007. The study concerned the patients hospitalised in medicine, surgery, obstetrics, intensive care, following care and rehabilitation, day hospitalisation, hospitalisation at home, who presented one or several episodes of bloodstream infections. RESULTS: During year 2007, 2013 bloodstream infections were analysed. Only 63.9% of bloodstream infections had an adapted initial antibiotic treatment. Among this proportion of bloodstream infections, an adapted empirical treatment concerned mainly the community episodes, the urinary tract, the pulmonary tract, or maternal-foetal episodes and the maternity ward and pediatrics. The percentage of adapted treatments was superior in the bloodstream infections where were isolated an Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus pneumoniae or other streptococci. On the contrary, only a quarter of bloodstream infections due to an Enterobacteriaceae producing BLSE or to a MRSA had received an adapted empirical treatment. CONCLUSION: Only two-thirds of the patients developing a bloodstream infection received an adapted initial antibiotic treatment. This proportion was even lower when it was not about a community origin, in spite of the frequent administration of several anti-infectious molecules or with wide spectrum.
