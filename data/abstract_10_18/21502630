3-O-(3',3'-Dimethylsuccinyl) betulinic acid (DSB), also known as PA-457, bevirimat (BVM), or MPC-4326, is a novel HIV-1 maturation inhibitor. Unlike protease inhibitors, BVM blocks the cleavage of the Gag capsid precursor (CA-SP1) to mature capsid (CA) protein, resulting in the release of immature, noninfectious viral particles. Despite the novel mechanism of action and initial progress made in small-scale clinical trials, further development of bevirimat has encountered unexpected challenges, because patients whose viruses contain genetic polymorphisms in the Gag SP1 (positions 6 to 8) protein do not generally respond well to BVM treatment. To better define the role of amino acid residues in the HIV-1 Gag SP1 protein that are involved in natural polymorphisms to confer resistance to the HIV-1 maturation inhibitor BVM, a series of Gag SP1 chimeras involving BVM-sensitive (subtype B) and BVM-resistant (subtype C) viruses was generated and characterized for sensitivity to BVM. We show that SP1 residue 7 of the Gag protein is a primary determinant of SP1 polymorphism-associated drug resistance to BVM.
