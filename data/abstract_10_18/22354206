Our previous studies have shown that lowering the dose of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) and bortezomib in combination with intravenous dexamethasone on a longer 4-week cycle maintained efficacy and improved tolerability in both previously untreated and relapsed/refractory (R/R) multiple myeloma (MM) patients. Lenalidomide has shown efficacy in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone but this combination has been poorly tolerated. We conducted this phase 2 study (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01160484) to evaluate whether a longer 4-week schedule using modified doses and schedules of IV dexamethasone (40 mg), bortezomib (1.0 mg/m(2)) and PLD (4.0 mg/m(2)) administered on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 with lenalidomide 10 mg daily on days 1-14 (DVD-R) would be effective and tolerated for patients with R/R MM. A total of 40 heavily pretreated patients were enrolled and 84.6% showed clinical benefit (complete response, 20.5%; very good partial response, 10.3%; partial response, 17.9%; minimal response, 35.9%) to the combination regimen. An additional 10.3% showed stable disease and 5.1% progressed while on study. The regimen was well tolerated, with a low incidence of adverse events such as fatigue (40%), thrombocytopenia (35%), neutropenia (35%), anemia (30%), peripheral neuropathy (25%) and pneumonia (15%). Thus, the DVD-R regimen is well tolerated and produces high response rates for patients with R/R MM.
