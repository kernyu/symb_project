PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to characterize the molecular support of resistance to carbapenems, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones in carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates recovered between January 2011 and April 2013 from Algerian hospitals. METHODS: Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using disk diffusion and Etest methods. Carbapenemase activity was detected using both MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry assay and via microbiological tests. Carbapenem, aminoglycoside and fluoroquinolone resistance determinants were studied by PCR and sequencing. Clonal relationships between strains were determined using Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST). RESULTS: A total of 47 imipenem-resistant A. baumannii were isolated and identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. All imipenem-resistant strains were positive in the modified Hodge test, and EDTA inhibited the activity of metallo-beta-lactamases enzymes in 11 strains. The blaOXA-23 gene was detected in 33 strains and the blaOXA-24 gene in 10 strains. The metallo-beta-lactamase blaNDM-1 gene was detected in 11 isolates (23.4%) from Algiers and Setif, including 7 that co-expressed a blaOXA-23 gene. Resistance to aminoglycosides was due to the production of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, AAC(3)-Ia, AADA, ANT(2'')-I, APH(3')-VI, and 16S rRNA methylases, ArmA. The fluoroquinolone resistance was mainly associated with mutations at Ser83Leu and Ser80Leu of the gyrA and parC genes, respectively. MLST revealed five sequence types (STs), 1, 2, 19, 25, and 85. The imipenem-resistant A. baumannii ST2 was the predominant clone (35/47). CONCLUSIONS: Here we report for the first time clinical multidrug-resistant A. baumannii isolates harboring 16S rRNA methylase gene, armA, and rapid spread of metallo-beta-lactamase NDM-1 isolated from patients in Algeria.
