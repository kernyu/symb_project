BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The root extract of the African Uzara plant is used in traditional medicine as anti-diarrheal drug. It is known to act via inhibition of intestinal motility, but malabsorptive or antisecretory mechanisms are unknown yet. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: HT-29/B6 cells and human colonic biopsies were studied in Ussing experiments in vitro. Uzara was tested on basal as well as on forskolin- or cholera toxin-induced Cl(-) secretion by measuring short-circuit current (I(SC)) and tracer fluxes of (22)Na(+) and (36)Cl(-). Para- and transcellular resistances were determined by two-path impedance spectroscopy. Enzymatic activity of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and intracellular cAMP levels (ELISA) were measured. KEY RESULTS: In HT-29/B6 cells, Uzara inhibited forskolin- as well as cholera toxin-induced I(SC) within 60 minutes indicating reduced active chloride secretion. Similar results were obtained in human colonic biopsies pre-stimulated with forskolin. In HT-29/B6, the effect of Uzara on the forskolin-induced I(SC) was time- and dose-dependent. Analyses of the cellular mechanisms of this Uzara effect revealed inhibition of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, a decrease in forskolin-induced cAMP production and a decrease in paracellular resistance. Tracer flux experiments indicate that the dominant effect is the inhibition of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Uzara exerts anti-diarrheal effects via inhibition of active chloride secretion. This inhibition is mainly due to an inhibition of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and to a lesser extent to a decrease in intracellular cAMP responses and paracellular resistance. The results imply that Uzara is suitable for treating acute secretory diarrhea.
