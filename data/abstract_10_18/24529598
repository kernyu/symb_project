In this paper we describe how utilization of low molecular weight alginate-derived oligosaccharide (ADO) and chito-oligosaccharide (COS) in conjunction with antibiotics, could more effectively inhibit the growth of wild-type and resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Inhibition is effected by modulating the bacteria's quorum sensing (QS) system, thus regulating biofilm formation and reducing resistance to antibiotic treatment. This can be demonstrated by using conventional MIC screening. COS showed synergistic effects with azithromycin, whereas ADO indicated additive effects against wild-type P. aeruginosa. Using electrospray-ionization mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS), matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flightmass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), the chemical structure of ADO and of COS was characterized. The wild-type and resistant strains were identified by 16S rRNA sequence analysis. This report demonstrates the feasibility of attenuating the tolerance of P. aeruginosa to azithromycin by using specific marine oligosaccharides.
