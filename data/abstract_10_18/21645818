One hundred and twenty-one Salmonella isolates were obtained from food, feed, and live chicken samples derived from 13 countries or regions. In this study, their subtypes were evaluated by serotyping and multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and their genetic profiles were also characterized. It was demonstrated by serotyping on these isolates that 36 various serovars were obtained in this study, of which three serotypes S. Babelsberg, S. Fresno, and S. II were first found in mainland China. Based on Simpson's index of diversity, the serotyping method had a 0.943 discriminatory power. Meanwhile, there were a total of 42 unique sequence types (STs) characterized by MLST, and the discriminatory power of MLST (D = 0.947) was close to that of the serotyping method. In MLST, hisD revealed the highest levels of nucleotide diversity. In addition, ST-92 was the most common ST represented by 16 Salmonella isolates, followed by ST-367 which was represented by 14 isolates. Seven new alleles were identified, which were associated with other alleles and resulted in the assignment of nine new STs. It was concluded from the results that MLST was generally associated with serotype, but not associated with the epidemiological source of the samples, and antimicrobial resistance patterns.
