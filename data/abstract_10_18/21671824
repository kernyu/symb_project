Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a leading cause of infectious morbidity in newborns. We describe the prevalence of GBS colonization and the serotypes and antibiotic susceptibility profiles of isolates obtained from a cohort of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected pregnant women. This was a cross-sectional study at a centre for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Vaginal and rectal swabs were collected at 35-37 weeks of gestation from 158 eligible women. GBS isolates were serotyped and antimicrobial susceptibility tests performed. Patient sociodemographic characteristics, CD4 counts and viral loads were abstracted from records. The overall anogenital prevalence of GBS colonization was 49/158 (31.0%): 40/158 (25.3%) for vagina, 19/158 (12.0%) for rectum and 10/158 (6.3%) for both. Predominant serotypes were Ib (34.9%) and Ia (25.6%). All were penicillin-susceptible. Two were resistant to erythromycin (4.0%) and one to clindamycin (2.0%). The colonization rate by GBS was high in this cohort. Serotype Ib was the most frequently identified.
