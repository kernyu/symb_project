We assessed the effects of time from hospitalization and culture source on bacterial susceptibility profiles. Increasing resistance correlated with increasing time from hospitalization for all bacterial groups, with 7 days in hospital representing the best time point for dichotomizing susceptibility rates rather than 48 hours. Antibiograms based on isolates from any source best represented susceptibility profiles.
