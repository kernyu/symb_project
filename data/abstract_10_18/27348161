UNLABELLED: One of the most significant problems in antimicrobial therapy (AMT) is widespread administration of antimicrobial agents without relevant medical conditions. The aim of the research was the analysis of antimicrobial agent prescribing practices for outpatient treatment of acute tonsillopharyngitis at the Karaganda Polyclinic numero sign1 and Polyclinic numero sign2. The analysis of antimicrobial agents prescribing practices for outpatient treatment of acute tonsillopharyngitis was conducted; medical records of outpatients with acute tonsillopharyngitis treated in 2014 at Polyclinics numero sign1 and numero sign2 were analyzed. INCLUSION CRITERIA: patients ranging in age from18 to 44, verified diagnosis - acute tonsillopharyngitis. It was found that in all cases antimicrobial agents have been prescribed speculatively, without previous bacteriological study or method of express diagnostics of Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS). In a majority of cases beta-lactams were prescribed. Flemoxin Solutab was the most commonly prescribed beta-lactam in Polyclinic numero sign1; Amoxicillin was the most commonly prescribed beta-lactam at Polyclinic numero sign2; it associated with personal experience of administration of these agents rather than data of evidentiary medicine. Study of actual medicine administration showed that in half of the cases dosage regimen, rout of administration, dosage and treatment session duration have not been followed. For the development of clinical guidelines for rational treatment of acute tonsillopharyngitis is necessary to study the local spectrum of the major pathogens and their antimicribial resistance.
