BACKGROUND: Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are opportunistic pathogens. Methicillin resistance is common in CoNS and may play an important role as reservoir of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) for Staphylococcus aureus. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine molecular characteristics of nasal carriage of methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci among students. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MR-CoNS from both nares of students were collected. Resistance to methicillin was determined by cefoxitin (30mug) disk diffusion test. SCCmec typing was performed using multiplex PCR by mec complex classes and ccr genes. Antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were determined on Mueller-Hinton agar according to CLSI. RESULTS: A total of 600 consecutive students were enrolled in this study; 430 of whom (71.7%) had CoNS. Seventy-two MR-CoNS strains, 21 (29.2%) S. lugdunensis, 17 (23.6%) S. haemolyticus, 17 (23.6%) S. saprophyticus, 9 (12.5%) S. epidermidis and 8 (11.1%) S. schleiferi were isolated. MR-CoNS rate in nasal carriage was 16.7%. All strains were susceptible to vancomycin. Forty-eight (66.7%) had a single SCCmec type including types I (n = 5), II (n = 4), III (n = 7), IV (n = 19) and V (n = 13), whereas 5 (6.9%) had two types including III + IV (n = 2), III + V (n = 1) and IV + V (n = 2). Nineteen strains (26.4%) were non-typeable for their SCCmec and ccr. Types IV and V SCCmec were associated with S. lugdunensis and S. haemolyticus, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: SCCmec types IV and V were prevalent in MR-CoNS and few isolates could harbor more than one type.
