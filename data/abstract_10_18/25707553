OBJECTIVE: Maternal peripheral insulin resistance and increased inflammation are two features of pregnancies complicated by pre-existing maternal obesity and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). There is now increasing evidence that activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling pathways by viral products may play a role in the pathophysiology of diabetes. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the effect of the TLR3 ligand and viral dsRNA analogue polyinosinic polycytidilic acid (poly(I:C)) on inflammation and the insulin signalling pathway in skeletal muscle from pregnant women. MATERIALS/METHODS: Human skeletal muscle tissue explants were performed to determine the effect of poly(I:C) on the expression and secretion of markers of inflammation, and the insulin signalling pathway and glucose uptake. RESULTS: Poly(I:C) significantly increased the expression of a number of inflammatory markers in skeletal muscle from pregnant women. Specifically, there was an increase in the expression and/or secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, and IL-6 and the pro-inflammatory chemokines IL-8 and MCP-1. These effect of poly(I:C) appear to mediated via a number of signalling molecules including the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-kappaB, and the serine threonine kinases GSK3 and AMPKalpha. Additionally, poly(I:C) decreased insulin stimulated GLUT-4 expression and glucose uptake in skeletal muscle from pregnant women. CONCLUSIONS: The in vitro data presented in this study suggests that viral infection may contribute to the pathophysiology of pregnancies complicated by pre-existing maternal obesity and/or GDM. It should be noted that the in vitro studies cannot be directly used to infer the same outcomes in the intact subject.
