Gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma is a rare extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma that is often associated with plasmacytic differentiation. However, the clinicopathological characteristics of gastric MALT lymphoma with increased plasmacytic differentiation have not yet been studied. To assess the clinicopathological implications of gastric MALT lymphoma with increased plasmacytic differentiation, 36 cases with increased plasmacytic differentiation and a control group of 16 cases with minimal plasmacytic differentiation were retrospectively collected from 65 primary gastric MALT lymphomas (2010-2012). The hematoxylin and eosin slides were reviewed, and IgG, IgG4, and kappa and lambda immunohistochemical staining was performed. Clinicopathological differences between the 2 groups were compared using the chi(2) test and odds ratios. Logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate resistance to Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy. Increased plasmacytic differentiation is significantly correlated with the H pylori eradication response (94.4% versus 66.7%, P=.018), lower frequency of relapse (5.6% versus 35.7%, P=.014), the presence of more than one IgG4+ cell per high-power field (27.8% versus 0%, P=.022), and light-chain restriction (33.3% versus 6.2%, P=.044). Univariable logistic regression indicated that negative H pylori status (P=.016) and minimal plasmacytic differentiation (P=.019) were statistically significant predictive factors for resistance to H pylori eradication. Multivariable logistic regression analyses identified no statistically significant predictive factors. However, H pylori negativity and minimal plasmacytic differentiation showed a statistical trend toward significance (P=.078 and P=.09). Gastric MALT lymphomas with increased plasmacytic differentiation have different clinicopathological characteristics, and plasmacytic differentiation is associated with H pylori eradication response.
