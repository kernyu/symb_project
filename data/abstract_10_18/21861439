In a nationwide antimicrobial susceptibility survey of 494 Nesseria gonorrhoeae isolates collected from February 2008 to December 2009 in 3 regions of Japan, 112 (22.7%) were collected from western Japan (Kinki, Chugoku, Shikoku, and Kyushu), 277 (56.1%) from mid-eastern Japan (Kanto), and 105 (21.1%) from eastern Japan (Tokai, Hokuriku, Koushinetsu, Tohoku, and Hokkaido). Resistance to ciprofloxacin (CPFX) was 72.8%, to penicillin G (PCG) 19.8%, and to tetracycline (TC) 18.2%. Intermediate resistance to CPFX was 1.8%, to PCG 73.7%, and to TC 43.7%. These results indicate that both types of resistance to the 3 agents were very high. Intermediate resistance to cefixime (CFIX) was 38.1% and to cefozidim (CDZM) 13.4%. Resistance to CFIX was only 0.4% and to CDZM 0%. Susceptibility to azithromycin was 96.6%, to ceftriaxone 99.8%, and to spectinomycin 100%. No significant difference in resistance was seen to different antimicrobial agent classes tested in the 3 regions, although intermediate resistance to CFIX in western Japan was significantly higher than in mid-eastern Japan.
