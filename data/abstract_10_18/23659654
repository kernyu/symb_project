OBJECTIVES: The prudent use of antibiotics (PUA) is promoted not only by public information campaigns, but also in the printed media and on websites. This study assesses the correspondence between PUA information in the Spanish printed media and on websites and the messages put out by national campaigns. Spaniards' use of antibiotics following the campaigns was also analysed. METHODS: A two-phase descriptive study was carried out. First, antibiotics-related news in the Spanish printed media (January 2007-May 2009) and institutional and news media websites (March-May 2009) were systematically reviewed using a data collection tool. In addition, a telephone survey on antibiotics-related knowledge and behaviours was carried out with a random sample of 1526 people living in Spain who had recently received medical care. RESULTS: In total, 29 news items containing nine different messages were identified. All the messages were similar to those promoted by the campaigns. The survey showed that even after the campaigns, relevant gaps in knowledge about the PUA persist, particularly among men (p = .005), those living in rural areas (p = .02) and the elderly (p < .001). Keeping left-over antibiotics was associated with ignorance about the association between antibiotic use and resistance (OR 3.1, 95% CI 2.3-4.2). Also, patients who ask their doctor about drug interactions are less likely to self-medicate (p = .04). CONCLUSIONS: The information reaching the Spanish public via the media seems to be similar to the messages transmitted by public information campaigns. Nevertheless, there appears to be considerable room for improvement. Promoting an active role in patients might reduce self-medication.
