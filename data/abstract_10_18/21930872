The objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial effects of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cements loaded with daptomycin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA) strains. Standardized cement specimens made from 40 g PMMA loaded with 1 g (low-dose), 4 g (middle-dose) or 8 g (high-dose) antibiotics were tested for elution characteristics and antibacterial activities. The patterns of release of antibiotics from the cement specimens were evaluated using in vitro broth elution assay with high-performance liquid chromatography. The activities of broth elution fluid against different Staphylococcus aureus strains (MSSA, MRSA, and VISA) were then determined. The antibacterial activities of all the tested antibiotics were maintained after being mixed with PMMA. The cements loaded with higher dosages of antibiotics showed longer elution periods. Regardless of the antibiotic loading dose, the teicoplanin-loaded cements showed better elution efficacy and provided longer inhibitory periods against MSSA, MRSA, and VISA than cements loaded with the same dose of vancomycin or daptomycin. Regarding the choice of antibiotics for cement loading in the treatment of Staphylococcus aureus infection, teicoplanin was superior in terms of antibacterial effects.
