Multiple antibiotic resistance and diverse mechanisms for biofilm formation make Coagulase Negative Staphylococci (CoNS) to cause infections associated with insertion of medical devices. As the infectious life style of CoNS pose difficult to treat conditions, materials with multitargeted antimicrobial effect can offer promising ways to modify the surface of devices to limit microbial growth. The broad spectrum of antimicrobial properties shown by silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) make it as an excellent candidate to act on device surface as persistent antimicrobial structures. In the current study, AgNPs assembled by soil bacteria under visible light at room temperature were analysed for its physical properties by UV-Vis spectroscopy, FTIR, SEM, HR-TEM and EDS and they also showed significant antimicrobial and antibiofilm properties against selected members of CoNS like Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. Very interestingly, further analysis on antibacterial mechanism of AgNPs showed their remarkable ability to cause disorganization of bacterial cell membrane. Further, surface engineering application of AgNPs on urinary catheter showed its excellent potential to prevent the attachment and colonization of CoNS which make result of study with significantly novel medical applications.
