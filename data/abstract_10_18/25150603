INTRODUCTION: Appropriate antiviral treatment is essential for living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) to be effective for treating hepatitis C. However, it has never been reported that pre-LDLT genetic analyses of both host and virus, with prediction of the outcome of post-LDLT antiviral treatment, indicated LDLT for a borderline case. CASE REPORT: We have reported the case of a 68-year-old woman with liver cirrhosis caused by genotype 1b hepatitis C, a history of ruptured esophageal varices, and adequately controlled minor ascites. Her liver function was classified as Child-Pugh grade B. The donor was a 42-year-old woman with an estimated left lobe graft volume (GV) of 33.8% based on the standard liver volume of the recipient. Molecular analyses used to confirm the indication of LDLT for this combination revealed the following: The rs8099917 genotype was T/T in the donor and recipient, the HCV core protein was double wild type, there were no mutations in the interferon sensitivity-determining region, and 8 mutations were found in the interferon/ribavirin resistance-determining region. LDLT was performed because very high sensitivity to interferon treatment was predicted. DISCUSSION: Six months after LDLT and uneventful post-LDLT courses, pegylated interferon-alpha2a and ribavirin were administered under immunosuppression with cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil. This regimen was continued for 48 weeks, resulting in a viral response at 10 weeks and a sustained viral response, as predicted. CONCLUSIONS: We have reported the usefulness of molecular analyses of host and viral factors for indicating LDLT to treat hepatitis C in a borderline case.
