We report the results of the international daptomycin surveillance programs for Europe, Latin America, and selected Asia-Pacific nations. A total of 7948 consecutive Gram-positive organisms of clinical significance were collected in 2011 and susceptibility tested against daptomycin and various comparator agents by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. M07-A9. Methods for dilution antimicrobial susceptibility tests for bacteria that grow aerobically; approved standard: ninth edition Wayne, PA: CLSI. 2012.; Cubicin Package Insert 2012.

The test medium was adjusted to contain physiological levels of calcium (50 mg/L) when testing daptomycin. Daptomycin exhibited potent activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus overall and for each region (MIC(50/90), 0.25-0.5/0.5 mug/mL), with susceptibility rates at 100.0% in Latin America, Australia/New Zealand, and India, and at 99.9% in Europe. The daptomycin MIC(50/90) for coagulase-negative staphylococci was also at 0.25-0.5/0.5 mug/mL, and only 1 isolate was considered nonsusceptible with a MIC value at 2 mug/mL. Daptomycin was also highly active against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(50/90), 1/1-2 mug/mL) and E. faecium (MIC(50/90), 2/2 mug/mL for both vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant isolates). All enterococcal isolates were susceptible to daptomycin (MIC, </=4 mug/mL) and tigecycline. Susceptibility to linezolid for E. faecalis was at 100.0%, while for E. faecium regional susceptibility rates were at 100.0% except in Europe (99.0%). Viridans group streptococci (MIC(50/90), 0.25/1 mug/mL) and beta-haemolytic streptococci (MIC(50/90), </=0.06/0.25 mug/mL) continue to be very susceptible to daptomycin. In summary, the results of this investigation document the high potency and wide spectrum of daptomycin when tested against a large resistance-surveillance collection of Gram-positive pathogens and indicate that daptomycin nonsusceptibility remains rare among indicated species after many years of clinical use worldwide.
