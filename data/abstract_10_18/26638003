PURPOSE: Cancer treatment causes mucositis and the manifestation of oral candidiasis. This study investigated the virulence properties and antifungal susceptibilities of Candida albicans isolated from cancer patients undergoing therapy. METHODS: C. albicans were isolated from 49 patients on cancer treatment and 21 healthy individuals and their virulence attributes measured. A correlation was determined between the length of treatment and the fungal counts and their virulence factors. RESULTS: Although Candida carriage was similar in all the study groups, high quantities of C. albicans and variety of Candida were found in cancer patients. Germ tubes were produced by all the strains. Significantly high number of yeast isolated from radiotherapy and chemotherapy produced large quantities of phospholipase compared to healthy individuals (p < 0.01). The length of chemotherapy was associated with an increase in the phospholipase production (p = 0.03) by the C. albicans. Proteinase production was seen in a significant number of isolates from the radiotherapy group (p < 0.01). Type of cancer treatment had no effect. Resistance to antifungal agents was low. CONCLUSIONS: High quantities of phospholipase were produced by C. albicans in cancer patients on therapy which also increased with the length of chemotherapy suggesting enhanced risk of oral and systemic infection. Therefore, during treatment, prophylactic topical antifungal therapy may be considered.
