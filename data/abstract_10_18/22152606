Reports of loss-of-efficacy (LOE) events in dogs infected with Dirofilaria immitis despite adherence to accepted prophylaxis regimens with a macrocyclic lactone anthelmintic are attracting considerable attention. It is crucially important to distinguish among several possible causes for these LOE reports, one of which is the evolution of resistance to these drugs in heartworms. We review here recent evidence at the molecular level that supports the hypothesis that parasites derived from LOE cases have experienced a strong selection event and that these populations are characterized by very high frequencies of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in a D. immitis gene encoding a P-glycoprotein transporter, comprised of homozygous guanosine residues at 2 locations ("GG-GG" genotype). Furthermore, an infected dog adopted to Canada from the southern United States harbored a microfilarial population that was insensitive to very high doses of macrocyclic lactones and was characterized by a high frequency of the GG-GG genotype associated with LOE cases. We propose that this case be defined as a drug-resistant heartworm infection and suggest that a simple assay for the existence of resistant parasites is a 7-day microfilariae suppression test, which can be performed in a veterinary clinic as part of an effort to document the geographic distribution of this phenotype.
