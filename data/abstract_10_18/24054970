INTRODUCTION: Small colony variants of Staphylococcus aureus (SCVSA) are a sub-population with special features. METHODS: The phenotypic features and antibiotic susceptibility of four clinical isolates SCVSA were studied. RESULTS: Colonies grew in the usual culture media, except in Mueller Hinton. All isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin and co-trimoxazole. DISCUSSION: As SCVSA are isolated with low frequency, it is necessary to determine the optimal methods for their identification and antibiotic susceptibility study.
