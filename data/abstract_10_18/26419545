Multiple drug resistant bacteria remain the greatest challenge in public health care. Globally, infections produced by such resistant strains are on the rise. Recent advent of genetic tolerance to antibiotics in many pathogens such as multiple drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a matter of concern, prompting researchers and pharmaceutical companies to search for new molecules and unconventional antibacterial agents. Recent advances in nanotechnology offer new opportunities to develop formulations based on metallic nanoparticles with different shapes and sizes and variable antimicrobial properties. This article is an extensive literature review that covers the latest approaches in the development of new and unconventional antibacterial agents using nanobiotechnological approaches which will better equip scientists and clinicians to face the challenges in view of dwindling stocks of effective and potent antimicrobial agents and formulations.
