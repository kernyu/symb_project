Emergence of artemisinin resistance in Cambodia highlights the importance of characterizing resistance to this class of drugs. Previously, intermediate levels of resistance in Plasmodium falciparum were generated in vitro for artelinic acid (AL) and artemisinin (QHS). Here we expanded on earlier selection efforts to produce levels of clinically relevant concentrations, and the resulting lines were characterized genotypically and phenotypically. Recrudescence assays determined the ability of resistant and parent lines to recover following exposure to clinically relevant levels of drugs. Interestingly, the parent clone (D6) tolerated up to 1,500 ng/ml QHS, but the resistant parasite, D6.QHS340x3, recovered following exposure to 2,400 ng/ml QHS. Resistant D6, W2, and TM91c235 parasites all exhibited elevated 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)s) to multiple artemisinin drugs, with >3-fold resistance to QHS and AL; however, the degree of resistance obtained with standard methods was remarkably less than expected for parasite lines that recovered from 2,400-ng/ml drug pressure. A novel assay format with radiolabeled hypoxanthine demonstrated a greater degree of resistance in vitro than the standard SYBR green method. Analysis of merozoite number in resistant parasites found D6 and TM91c235 resistant progeny had significantly fewer merozoites than parent strains, whereas W2 resistant progeny had significantly more. Amplification of pfmdr1 increased proportionately to the increased drug levels tolerated by W2 and TM91c235, but not in resistant D6. In summary, we define the artemisinin resistance phenotype as a decrease in susceptibility to artemisinins along with the ability to recover from drug-induced dormancy following supraclinical concentrations of the drug.
