PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis among female outpatients treated for genital infection at a Chinese hospital from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2013. METHODS: Samples from 6051 female outpatients were analyzed using Mycoplasma Identification and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (ID/AST). RESULTS: The overall prevalence of U. urealyticum was higher than the prevalence of single M. hominis infection (31.2% vs 0.7%) and coinfections (31.2% vs. 1.9%). The percentage of U. urealyticum and/or M. hominis detected in the 30-39 year age group was greater than in the other age groups. More than 94.6% of the U. urealyticum isolates, 100% of the M. hominis isolates, and 84.3% of the isolates from coinfections were susceptible to doxycycline, minocycline, and tetracycline. More than 69.2% of the U. urealyticum isolates were susceptible to azithromycin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, and roxithromycin, but > 95.6% of the M. hominis isolates and 89.6% of the isolates from coinfections were resistant to these antibiotics. Acetylspiramycin, sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin were inactive against more than one-half of the isolates. More than 75.6% of the M. hominis isolates were susceptible to spectinomycin, but > 87.1% of the U. urealyticum and 93.3% of the coinfection isolates were resistant to this antibiotic. Isolates from three coinfections were completely resistant to the 14 antibiotics. CONCLUSION: The determination of antimicrobial susceptibility of these mycoplasma species is often crucial for optimal antimicrobial therapy of infected outpatients.
