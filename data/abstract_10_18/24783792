Hospitals worldwide are facing unprecedented crisis due to increasingly rapid emergence and dissemination of antimicrobial resistant staphylococci in wounds and burns and its environs via plasmid mediation. This study was conducted to evaluate the plasmid-mediated or chromosomal-mediated resistance in staphylococci. One hundred clinical swabs from wounds and burns patients were demonstrated for presence of staphylococci using mannitol salt agar. Various biochemical, DNase and beta-lactamase test was carried out and the plasmid curing assay was demonstrated using 0.1 mg mL(-1) acridine orange on antibiotic resistant isolates. The results revealed S. aureus (47) and coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS) (6). beta-lactamase producing species of S. aureus were 14 and CoNS was 1. Most isolates showed high resistance pattern to gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, rifampicin, chloramphenicol, ampiclox and others. The antibiotic resistance isolates were highly indicative ofplasmid-borne and few are chromosomal-borne after the plasmid curing analysis. The plasmid-mediated resistance observed among various antibiotics poses difficulty in treatment for clinicians. This high plasmid-mediated resistance among the isolates and from other studies calls for an urgent surveillance and epidemiological studies to infection control.
