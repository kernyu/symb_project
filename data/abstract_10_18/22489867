BACKGROUND: Enzybiotics are becoming increasingly recognized as potential alternative therapies for drug-resistant bacteria. Although only a few enzybiotics are currently well characterized, much information is still missing or is unavailable for researchers. The construction of an enzybiotics database would therefore increase efficiency and convenience in investigating these bioactive proteins and thus help reduce or delay the recent increase in antibiotic resistance. DESCRIPTION: In the present manuscript, we describe the development of a novel and original database called EnzyBase, which contains 1144 enzybiotics from 216 natural sources. To ensure data quality, we limited the source of information to authoritative public databases and published scientific literature. The interface of EnzyBase is easy to use and allows users to rapidly retrieve data according to their desired search criteria and blast the database for homologous sequences. We also describe examples of database-aided enzybiotics discovery and design. CONCLUSION: EnzyBase serves as a unique tool for enzybiotic studies. It has several potential applications, e.g. in silico enzybiotic combination as cocktails, and novel enzybiotic design, in response to continuously emerging drug-resistant pathogens. This database is a valuable platform for researchers who are interested in enzybiotic studies. EnzyBase is available online at http://biotechlab.fudan.edu.cn/database/EnzyBase/home.php.
