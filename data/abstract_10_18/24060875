Rifampin is a potent inducer of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and transporters. Drug-drug interactions during tuberculosis treatment are common. Induction by rifapentine and rifabutin is understudied. Rifampin and rifabutin significantly induced CYP3A4 (80-fold and 20-fold, respectively) in primary human hepatocytes. The induction was concentration dependent. Rifapentine induced CYP3A4 in hepatocytes from 3 of 6 donors. Data were also generated for ABCB1, ABCC1, ABCC2, organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1), and OATP1B3. This work serves as a basis for further study of the extent to which rifamycins induce key metabolism and transporter genes.
