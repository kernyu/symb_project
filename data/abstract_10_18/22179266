The aim of this work was to know the anthelmintic resistance (AR) status of a Spanish sheep flock infected by gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) and the possible cross resistance among anthelmintics of the macrocyclic lactones (ML) family. The Faecal Egg Count Reduction Test (FECRT) was carried out to check the efficacy of albendazole (Zodalben(R)), levamisole (LEV) (Endex(R)) and an oral formulation of ivermectin (IVM) (Oramec(R)), at the recommended dose rates. Then, the study was extended to check the cross resistance between drugs of the ML family: injectable IVM (Ivomec(R)), oral moxidectin (Cydectin(R)), injectable moxidectin (Biodectin(R)) and doramectin (Dectomax(R)), at the recommended dose rates. The GIN species were identified after faecal cultures in all groups. The FECRT showed the resistance of a Teladorsagia circumcincta isolate against LEV (39-58%), IVM (88-92%) and doramectin (85%). This study is the first report to confirm the side resistance between these MLs, which belong to the avermectin chemical group, in a Spanish sheep flock. The in vitro efficacy of LEV and IVM was measured by the Larval Feeding Inhibition Assay (LFIA) using the IC(50) measurement (concentration needed to inhibit the ingestion of 50% L1). The values of the multidrug resistant isolate were 0.25 mug/ml for LEV and 3 ng/ml for IVM. Both results were higher than the values obtained with a susceptible isolate, which could be indicative of AR. However, further research examining the response of a greater range of susceptible and resistant nematodes isolates should be carried out to establish a discrimination threshold.
