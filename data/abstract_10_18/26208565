Quinolones are one of the most frequently prescribed antimicrobials for the treatment of urinary tract infections. The aim of the study was to determine the rate and pattern of Quinolone resistance among common urinary tract isolates from January 2011 to December 2013 in patients with Urinary Tract Infection (UTI). A total of 5891 of all clinical isolates were included in the study. The most prevalent urinary isolate was Escherichia coli, responsible for 70% UTIs in outpatients and 63% in indoor patients. The resistance was 85%, 64% and 62% and 89%, 76%, and 73% to Nalidixic acid, Norfloxacin and Ciprofloxacin among the out-patients and for Indoor patients respectively. Resistance was also remarkably high among other urinary tract isolates. This high rate of Quinolone resistance among all urinary tract isolates makes it a questionable first line empirical treatment for UTI.
