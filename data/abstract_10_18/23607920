INTRODUCTION: Inappropriate use of antibiotics leads to increased levels of bacterial resistance making it difficult to treat upper respiratory tract infections. The appropriate use of these drugs has a fundamental role in controlling resistance and in success of treatment of childhood infections. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the prescription and use of antibiotics for Brazilian children. METHODS: The use of antibiotics in 160 children was monitored in two Primary Health Centers by questionnaires administered to parents and caregivers that assessed the social, demographic and clinical conditions of the children. Furthermore, the antibiotic use pattern was ascertained in these children and compared to the recommendations of the Brazilian and international guidelines. RESULTS: The use of these drugs had an inverse relationship with children breast-fed to six months of age, showing that breast-fed children had a tendency to use less of these drugs. There was great variability in the amoxicillin doses used for upper respiratory infections ranging from 8.2 to 91.9mg/kg/day. The doses used in most treatments were far below the doses recommended in the Brazilian and international guidelines (50% and 97%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Although there are guidelines for the use of these medications, compliance is still very low, leading to under dosage and therapeutic failures. It is essential for pediatricians to be aware of and comply with the guidelines, avoid personal decisions and take measures based on strong clinical evidence. The proper use of these medications, in addition to greater therapeutic success, decreases the possibility of the appearance of resistant microorganisms.
