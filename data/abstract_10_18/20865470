Cancer patients are at risk of infectious complications due to neutropenia following chemotherapy or early post-HSCT (Hemato Stem Cell Transplantation). The first episode of fever during recent onset neutropenia is caused mostly by bacteria, while subsequent episodes are mainly fungal in nature. Proper management of infectious complications in neutropenic cancer patients requires classification into the appropriate risk category and knowledge of the local epidemiology of infections, of the causative organisms and their resistance phenotype.
