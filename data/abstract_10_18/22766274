OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess the activity of the Antibiolor network, created in 2003, to promote antibiotic stewardship in Lorraine, and comply with the French Ministry guidelines issued in May 2002. METHODS: The authors described the objectives and structure of the network, actions implemented with physicians, pharmacists, community or hospital biologists, and evaluation. RESULTS: The network is made up of five committees supervised by a pilot committee. Over the previous 7 years, various actions were undertaken such as the drafting of guidelines for the hospitals and general practitioners, the creation of a hotline for advice on antibiotic treatment, the creation of a website, and giving information on infectious diseases via a quarterly letter sent to healthcare professionals. The network participated in continuous medical education for practitioners and organized the evaluation of professional practice in Lorraine hospitals. It also helped set up a network of community private laboratories for the study of resistance in the most frequently isolated bacteria, and implemented the monitoring of antibiotic consumption in hospitals. CONCLUSION: After 7 years, the Lorraine antibiology network has proved its beneficial role in terms of communication and scientific information for antibiotic stewardship. The Antibiolor network would like to follow other indicators in the future, such as the evolution of community antibiotic consumption in partnership with the public healthcare insurance.
