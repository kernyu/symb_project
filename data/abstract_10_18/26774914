The occurrence of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was monitored in organic amendments and agricultural soils from various sites in France and Tunisia. S. maltophilia was detected in horse and bovine manures, and its abundance ranged from 0.294 (+/-0.509) x 10(3) to 880 (+/-33.4) x 10(3) CFU (g drywt)(-1) of sample. S. maltophilia was recovered from most tested soil samples (104/124). Its abundance varied from 0.33 (+/-0.52) to 414 (+/-50) x 10(3) CFU (g drywt)(-1) of soil and was not related to soil characteristics. Antibiotic resistance properties of a set of environmental strains were compared to a clinical set, and revealed a high diversity of antibiotic resistance profiles, given both the numbers of resistance and the phenotypes. Manure strains showed resistance phenotypes, with most of the strains resisting between 7 and 9 antibiotics. While French soil strains were sensitive to most antibiotics tested, some Tunisian strains displayed resistance phenotypes close to those of clinical French strains. Screening for metal resistance among 66 soil strains showed a positive relationship between antibiotic and metal resistance. However, the prevalence of antibiotic resistance phenotypes in the studied sites was not related to the metal content in soil samples.
