Due to the rapidly growing bacterial resistance to antibiotics and the scarcity of novel agents under development, bacterial infections are still a pressing global problem, making new types of antibacterial agents, which are effective both alone and in combination with traditional antibiotics, urgently needed. In this paper, seven series of N-arylsulfonylindole analogs 5-11 bearing rhodanine moieties were synthesized, characterized, and evaluated for antibacterial activity. According to the in vitro antimicrobial results, half of the synthesized compounds showed potent inhibition against four Gram-positive bacteria, with MIC values in the range of 0.5-8 microg/mL. For multidrug-resistant strains, compounds 6a and 6c were the most potent, with MIC values of 0.5 microg/mL, having comparable activity to gatifloxacin, moxiflocaxin and norfloxacin and being 128-fold more potent than oxacillin (MIC = 64 microg/mL) and 64-fold more active than penicillin (MIC = 32 microg/mL) against Staphylococcus aureusATCC 43300.
