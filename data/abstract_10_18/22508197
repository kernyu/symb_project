OBJECTIVE: To identify strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) circulating in Bamako and to examine the relationship between the strains and their drug susceptibility profiles. METHODS: Between 2006 and 2010, we conducted a cross-sectional study using spoligotyping to identify strains of MTC recovered from 126 tuberculosis (TB) patients under treatment in Bamako, Mali. RESULT: Three members of the MTC were isolated: M. tuberculosis (71.4%), M. africanum (27.8%) and M. bovis (0.8%). Of these, three strains were found to be the most prevalent: M. tuberculosis T1 (MTB T1; 38.9%), M. africanum F2 (MAF2; 26.2%) and M. tuberculosis Latin American and Mediterranean 10 (MTB LAM 10; 10.3%). MAF2 and MTB LAM 10 strains have a lower risk of multidrug resistance (MDR) than MTB T1 (respectively OR 0.1, 95%CI 0.03-0.4 and OR 0.1, 95%CI 0.01-0.8). Age >/= 32 years (OR 1.4, 95%CI 0.4-3.9), negative human immunodeficiency virus status (OR 0.4, 95%CI 0.1-2.5) and male sex (OR 4, 95%CI 0.9-16.5) were not associated with MDR. The prevalence of MDR among treatment and retreatment failure patients was respectively 25% and 81.8% compared to new patients (2.9%). CONCLUSION: This study indicates a low level of primary drug resistance in Bamako, affirms the importance of using correct drug regimens, and suggests that the MTB T1 strain may be associated with the development of resistance.
