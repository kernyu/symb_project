The contribution of interleukin-3 (IL-3), a hematopoietic growth factor and immunoregulatory cytokine, to resistance to blood-stage malaria was investigated by infecting IL-3-deficient (knockout [KO]) mice with Plasmodium berghei NK65. Male IL-3 KO mice, but not female mice, were more resistant to infection than wild-type (WT) mice, as evidenced by lower peak parasitemia and prolonged survival. Both male and female IL-3 KO mice had increased splenomegaly and were more anemic than corresponding WT mice. Anemia was compensated for by an increase in bone marrow and splenic erythropoiesis in IL-3 KO mice, as evidenced by higher levels of erythroid progenitors. Plasma levels of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and CXCL9 (monokine induced by IFN-gamma [MIG]) were found to be significantly reduced in IL-3 KO mice during early stages of infection. In contrast, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) levels were significantly higher, and the percentage of peripheral blood neutrophils lower, in infected IL-3 KO mice than in WT counterparts. Overall, our results indicate that IL-3 plays a critical role in suppressing protective immunity to P. berghei NK65 infection and that it is involved in inhibiting the development of splenomegaly, anemia, and erythropoiesis. IL-3 also influences IFN-gamma, CXCL9, and G-CSF production in response to infection. The abnormal responses seen in infected IL-3 KO mice may be due to the lack of IL-3 during development, to the lack of IL-3 in the infected mature mice, or to both.
