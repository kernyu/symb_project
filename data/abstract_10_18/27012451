Oleanolic (OA), ursolic (UA), and betulinic (BA) acids are three triterpenic acids (TAs) with potential effects for treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Mechanistic studies showed that these TAs act as hypoglycemic and antiobesity agents mainly through (i) reducing the absorption of glucose; (ii) decreasing endogenous glucose production; (iii) increasing insulin sensitivity; (iv) improving lipid homeostasis; and (v) promoting body weight regulation. Besides these promising beneficial effects, it is believed that OA, UA, and BA protect against diabetes-related comorbidities due to their antiatherogenic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. We also highlight the protective effect of OA, UA, and BA against oxidative damage, which may be very relevant for the treatment and/or prevention of T2DM. In the present review, we provide an integrative description of the antidiabetic properties of OA, UA, and BA, evaluating the potential use of these TAs as food supplements or pharmaceutical agents to prevent and/or treat T2DM.
