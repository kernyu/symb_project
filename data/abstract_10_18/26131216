Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) plays plays an important role in nosocomial infection. To explore the heteroresistance of PA to imipenem (IMP), we detected the sensitivity of 140 strains of PA to IMP using the KB method and VITEK method. Combined with resistance mutation analysis, the heteroresistance of PA to IMP was determined. Whilst, the double disk synergy test and SYBGreen RT-PCR for efflux pump were performed in IMP-heteroresistant PA strains. In this study, we confirmed 20 IMP-heteroresistant strains. The double disk synergy tests suggested that none of 20 heteroresistant PA strains produced metalloenzyme. The SYBGreen quantitative RT-PCR revealed that the MexAB expression level of efflux pump in IMP-heteroresistant PA was significantly higher than that in the IMP-sensitive strains (P<0.05), while there was no significantly different between the MexCD expression between resistant strains and sensitive strains (P<0.05). We believe that the clinicians should pay more attention to the PA heteroresistance to IMP, and the heteroesistance of PA to IMP is related to high expression in the MexAB of PA efflux pump.
