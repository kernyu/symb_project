We tested the activities of anidulafungin and other antifungal agents against clinical isolates of different fungal species. For Candida species, high sessile MIC(9)(0)s (SMIC(9)(0)s) were obtained for fluconazole, voriconazole, and amphotericin B, whereas the anidulafungin SMIC(9)(0)s were very low, as were those for caspofungin. Comparatively, for Aspergillus species, higher SMIC(9)(0) values were obtained not only for amphotericin B and voriconazole but also for the echinocandins.
