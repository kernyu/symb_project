This study was aimed to investigate the relevance of nilotinib in combination with tetrandrine (Tet) on reversing multidrug resistance and inducing apoptosis of K562/A02 cell line and its mechanism. Methyl-thiazol tetrazolium (MTT) assay was employed to examine the pharmacological effect of nilotinib or Tet alone on K562/A02 cell line, the IC(50) of daunorubicin (DNR) on K562/A02 cell line treated with nilotinib and Tet was calculated; the flow cytometry (FCM) was employed to detect the apoptosis rate of K562/A02. The expression of bax/survivin mRNA was determined by RT-PCR, and the expression of bax/survivin protein was assayed by Western blot. The results showed that after being treated by 5 nmol/L nilotinib or 1.0 microml/L Tet for 48 hours, IC(50) of DNR to K562/A02 was 5.71 +/- 0.72 mg/L or 6.52 +/- 0.43 mg/L, respectively, while in their combined treatment, IC(50) decreased to 3.12 +/- 0.13 mg/L. Nilotinib or Tet alone could increase DNR-inducing apoptosis rate of K562/A02 cell, while the apoptosis rate of K562/A02 increased remarkably in combination treatment of nilotinib with Tet. After being treated with 5 nmol/L nilotinib or 1.0 microml/L Tet alone for 48 hours, the expressions of bax mRNA and BAX protein was up-regulated, while both effects were more obvious in combination treatment of nilotinib with Tet. Treatment with 5 nmol/L nilotinib or 1.0 micromol/L Tet alone for 48 hours down-regulated the expression of survivin mRNA and its protein, while treatment of nilotinib in combination with Tet had more significant effect on down-regulation of their expression. It is concluded that the K562/A02 cells are resistant to DNR, nilotinib or Tet alone both can partially reverse resistance of K562/A02 cells to DNR, increase the apoptosis rate of K562/A02 cells. Combination of nilotinib with Tet shows obvious synergistic action, mechanism of which may associate with up-regulation of bax mRNA and BAX protein expressions and down-regulation of survivin mRNA and its protein expressions.
