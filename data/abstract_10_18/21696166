The Glu166Arg/Met182Thr mutant of Escherichia coli TEM(pTZ19-3) beta-lactamase produces a 128-fold increase in the level of resistance to the antibiotic ceftazidime in comparison to that of the parental wild-type enzyme. The single Glu166Arg mutation resulted in a dramatic decrease in both the level of enzyme expression in bacteria and the resistance to penicillins, with a concomitant 4-fold increase in the resistance to ceftazidime, a third-generation cephalosporin. Introduction of the second amino acid substitution, Met182Thr, restored enzyme expression to a level comparable to that of the wild-type enzyme and resulted in an additional 32-fold increase in the minimal inhibitory concentration of ceftazidime to 64 mug/mL. The double mutant formed a stable covalent complex with ceftazidime that remained intact for the entire duration of the monitoring, which exceeded a time period of 40 bacterial generations. Compared to those of the wild-type enzyme, the affinity of the TEM(pTZ19-3) Glu166Arg/Met182Thr mutant for ceftazidime increased by at least 110-fold and the acylation rate constant was augmented by at least 16-fold. The collective experimental data and computer modeling indicate that the deacylation-deficient Glu166Arg/Met182Thr mutant of TEM(pTZ19-3) produces resistance to the third-generation cephalosporin ceftazidime by an uncommon covalent-trapping mechanism. This is the first documentation of such a mechanism by a class A beta-lactamase in a manifestation of resistance.
