Molecular hybridization approach is an emerging tool in drug discovery for designing new pharmacophores with biological activity. A novel, new series of coumarin-benzimidazole hybrids were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their broad spectrum antimicrobial activity. Among all the synthesized molecules, compound (E)-3-(2-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-1-yl)-1-((4-chlorobenzyl)oxy)imino)ethyl)-2H-chromen -2-one showed the most promising broad spectrum antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Proteus vulgaris. In addition, it has showed no cytotoxicity and hemolysis at 10 times the MIC concentration. SAR studies indicate that position of the chlorine atom in the hybrid critically determines the antibacterial activity.
