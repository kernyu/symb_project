Gemifloxacin efficiency and tolerance in comparison to the ofloxacin, levofloxacin and gatifloxacin during the intensive phase of the antituberculosis therapy for drug resistant cases was evaluated. 156 drug resistant TB patients were examined in the open, prospective, randomized research, being divided into 2 groups with similar drug resistance profile. The 1st group received gemifloxacin, the 2nd--other fluoroquinolones. Gemifloxacin efficiency in the treatment regimen for the drug resistant TB patients did not differ from the efficiency of the use of other fluoroquinolones of the 4th generation and was significantly higher in comparison to ofloxacin. At the same time the identical level of side effects was registered in the course of treatment with mentioned drugs. Gemifloxacin is effective and safe at treatment of tuberculosis in comparison to other fluoroquinolones that allows considering it as the drug of choice among fluoroquinolones for treatment of drug resistant TB, including multidrug-resistant TB.
