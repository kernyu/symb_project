BACKGROUND: In children, renal biopsy is routinely required in the management of idiopathic steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome particularly prior to starting nephrotoxic immunosuppressive agents. AIM: To investigate the correlations between the results of initial renal biopsy in Tunisian children with idiopathic steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome and the subsequent response to cyclosporineprednisolone combination. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of children with idiopathic steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome over the period 2002- 2009. Data on clinico-biological features, histological diagnosis and response to cyclosporine-prednisolone were collected. RESULTS: Thirty patients were enrolled, of whom 16 had focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, eight had minimal change disease and six had diffuse mesangial proliferation. Complete Remission was achieved in 15 patients (50%). Nine patients (30%) went into partial remission. Only six patients presented no response (20%). No statistically significant relationship between the different pathological types and the response to CsA-prednisone was found. CONCLUSION: In our study, two important facts were noted: 1) the predominant histopathological subtype was the focal segmental glomerulosclerosis; 2) a high remission rate was achieved in our patients using a combined cyclosporine-prednisolone treatment regimen. This response is not dependent on the histological type.
