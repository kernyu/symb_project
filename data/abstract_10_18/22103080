A novel kind of environmentally friendly nanocomposites, waterborne polyurethane (WBPU)/Cu(II)-loaded hydroxyapatite (CuHAp), with improved physical properties and antibacterial activity have been prepared via in-situ polymerization from functionalized CuHAp nanoparticles (CuHAp NPs). The interaction of the CuHAp NPs with isophorone diisocyanate to form the functionalized CuHAp NPs containing isocyanate groups (CuHAp-g-NCO) has been studied. The microstructure and particle distribution of the nanocomposites were observed using scanning electron microscopy. The improvements of mechanical properties, thermal stability and water resistance of the nanocomposites have also been evaluated. Finally, the antibacterial activity was tested against G(-) Escherichia coli and G(+) Staphylococcus aureus by the zone of inhibition test and the direct contact test. The long-lasting antibacterial activity was studied by measuring antibacterial ability of the nanocomposites after being immersed in water. The results indicate that WBPU incorporation with CuHAp NPs shows strong antibacterial activity upon contact, and long-lasting antibacterial property.
