The synthesis and antibacterial activity of 3-methylenepyrrolidine formyl hydroxyamino derivatives are reported. The antibacterial activities of these derivatives were evaluated to discover SAR at P(1') and P(3') positions, and most of these derivatives exhibit better in vitro antibacterial activity than existing drugs against drug-resistant clinical isolates including MRSA, PRSP, and Haemophilus influenzae.
