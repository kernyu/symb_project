OBJECTIVE: To outline the current situation of gonococcal antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the Western Pacific region and factors that impact on this. BACKGROUND: The Western Pacific region is densely populated with many living in poverty. There are high rates of infectious diseases, and a disproportionate burden of gonococcal disease. In many countries there is uncontrolled antimicrobial use: these are ideal conditions for the emergence of AMR. METHODS: Gonococcal AMR in this region has been monitored for more than 20 years. Clinical isolates, predominantly from unselected patients attending sexually transmitted diseases clinics, are tested against a panel of antibiotics. Quality assurance and control strategies are in place. RESULTS: There is widespread, high level resistance to penicillin and ciprofloxacin. Decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone (MIC >/= 0.06 mg/L) is reported in high levels from some countries in the region. Low numbers of isolates tested in some countries reflect capacity for testing, and are suboptimal for surveillance. CONCLUSION: The raised MIC values to ceftriaxone, and the emergence and spread of ceftriaxone resistant strains regionally is alarming. Sustaining and enhancing surveillance is critical; however obtaining an adequate sample size is a long-standing issue. The implementation of molecular surveillance strategies could provide broader information on the spread and threat of AMR.
