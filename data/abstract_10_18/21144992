Infections caused by drug-resistant and multidrug-resistant microbial pathogens pose tremendous challenges to health care systems, including challenges related to the diagnosis, treatment, and containment of these infections. These challenges are amplified in the intensive care unit (ICU), where pressures for selection and emergence of resistance and risks of transmission of resistant pathogens are highest, and where the threat of resistance drives selection of empiric antimicrobial regimens. This article reviews basic concepts of resistance to antibacterial agents including mechanisms and modes of transmission, and discusses management issues for the important drug-resistant pathogens found in the ICU.
