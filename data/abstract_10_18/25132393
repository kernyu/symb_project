Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has become a global problem for health care services, with fewer antimicrobials entering the market and some pathogenic organisms becoming resistant to commonly used antimicrobials. Antimicrobial stewardship (AS), including evidence-based standard setting, education and communication, and audits of practice, has become a key method of preventing the rise in the rise in AMR. Data on antibiotic consumption are often obtained through prospective and retrospective point prevalence audits of antibiotic usage, but such studies are very resource intensive and only provide a snapshot of consumption. The objective of the study reported here was to examine longitudinal total antibacterial usage at a national level and cross-sectional usage at an individual hospital trust level using a commercial database that captures antimicrobial prescribing from at least 99% of English hospital Trusts.
