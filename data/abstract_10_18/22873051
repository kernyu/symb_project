The influence of tilorone dihydrochloride and its analogues--diphenyl derivatives on the changes of transmembrane potential of mitochondrial membranes of the isolated rat hepatocytes has been estimated. Authors have shown a significant increase in mitochondrial potential thirty minutes after the introduction of the test compounds to the cells using the fluorescent probe JC-1. These results indicate the rapid activation with tilorone and its analog--dihydrochloryde 4,4'-bis-[2-(diethylamino)ethoxy]diphenyl--of the RLR signaling pathway. The final stage of this pathway is the cell production of IFN type I. The authors concluded that there is an increasing of the organelles resistance to the extra/intracellular damaging agents under the influence of the test compounds.
