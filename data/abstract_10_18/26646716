BACKGROUND: Infectious diseases caused by multi-resistant pathogens are increasing worldwide and are posing a challenge to German urology as well. Furthermore, there is a limited perspective of new antibiotic developments. One way out of this dilemma is a differentiated handling and use of antibiotics (antibiotic stewardship, ABS). AIM: The aim of this review is to identify key issues in modern urological antibiotic therapy, which can be considered as exemplary for the whole topic of ABS. This includes a review of the current data of the individual topics, including thought-provoking impulse for future clinical application and research. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The research group "infectious diseases" of GeSRU Academics identified the following central topics: excessive use of fluoroquinolones, diagnosis and treatment of urethritis and perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. Subsequently, we performed a literature research in MEDLINE to uncover controversies and open questions of the individual topics within the meaning of ABS. RESULTS: The analysis of modern antibiotic therapy in urology shows numerous open questions in all quality dimensions of ABS: structural quality (e.g. through improved training of medical staff in the differentiated use of antibiotics), process quality (e.g. by improved adherence to existing infectiological guidelines, here in particular the perioperative prophylaxis and therapy of urethritis) and outcome (e.g. by detection of resistance rates and infection rates). DISCUSSION: The overarching and common goal is to avoid a post-antibiotic era. ABS programmes and a 10-point plan of the federal government are considered positive political developments in this area but do not release the individual urologist from a personal responsibility as part of his daily routine. A critical analysis of the topic "antibiotic treatment" is essential.
