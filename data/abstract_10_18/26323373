Twenty-eight strains isolated from dog clinical samples identified as Staphylococcus pseudintermedius by mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) were studied to assess antimicrobial susceptibility by the diffusion method and clonal relationship by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Methicillin resistance (3/28 isolates; 10,7%) was evaluated by mecA PCR. Fifteen strains (53.6%) were resistant to at least one of the antibiotics tested, and eleven of them (39.3%) showed multiple resistance (3 or more antimicrobial families). Eleven isolates (39.3%) were resistant to erythromycin due to the presence of ribosomal methylase ermB, whereas clindamycin inducible resistance was not detected. Twenty-seven (27) clonal types were differentiated by PFGE, suggesting high clonal diversity. We emphasize that the finding of multiresistant S. psedintermedius strains is an emerging problem to be considered in veterinary diagnostic laboratory treatment of canine infections and in public health settings.
