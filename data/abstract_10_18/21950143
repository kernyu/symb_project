Effect of salicylic and caproic acids as an inducters of plant resistance was studied using three onion cultivars differed in resistance to Botrytis spp. Salicylic and caproic acids were shown to prime callose accumulation in Allium cepa varieties resistant to B. allii and B. cinerea. The results obtained sugest that protection of onion against necrotrophs involves the priming of callose accumulation which is important mechanical barrier against invading pathogens.
