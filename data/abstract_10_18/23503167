A total of 159 Thai isolates of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae isolated from pneumonic lungs of pigs during 2006-2011 were investigated for their in vitro susceptibility to 12 antimicrobial agents. Low activity of chlortetracycline was indicated by the MIC range from 3.12-100 mug/ml and MIC90 of 50 mug/ml. Seventy-six isolates showed resistance to enrofloxacin, whereas 2 isolates showed resistance to macrolides and lincomycin. In addition, a point mutation at A2058G was revealed by sequence analysis of 23S ribosomal RNA in both isolates. The present results confirmed the rapid increase of resistant M. hyopneumoniae isolates against chlortetracycline, enrofloxacin, macrolides and lincomycin in Thailand. Selection of drugs to control swine diseases in Thailand must be done more prudently in consideration of reducing the antimicrobial resistance.
