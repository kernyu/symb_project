INTRODUCTION: Raoultella Planticola is a gram negative, aerobic, rod bacteria found in water and soil and is rarely reported to cause infections in humans. This case study is the first of its kind in reporting R. planticola appendicitis. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We report a case of a woman presenting with a two-day history of increased weakness, fatigue and anorexia, localized pain to the right lower quadrant, and elevated white blood cell count. CT results demonstrated acute uncomplicated appendicitis which was managed via laparoscopic appendectomy. The patient became febrile on the day of the procedure and was found to have R. planticola bacteremia which was treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate. She was discharged on postoperative day two and reported an unremarkable recovery at her five-week follow-up appointment. DISCUSSION: R. planticola is a common organism that is rarely, though increasingly, associated with human infection. Interestingly, prior to hospitalization, this patient did not have any risk factors commonly associated with R. planticola infection, such as seafood consumption. However, she may have had gastrointestinal tract colonization with R. planticola prior to onset of appendicitis and appendectomy. Bacteremia likely resulted from micro-perforation of the appendix. CONCLUSION: Although infection with R. planticola is typically benign when treated appropriately, this pathogen has homology with Klebsiella species, and has the potential to acquire antimicrobial resistance. The case presented here suggests that R. planticola should be considered as a potential source of bacteremia in inflammatory/infectious gastrointestinal tract diseases even in the absence of typical risk factors.
