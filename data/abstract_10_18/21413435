BACKGROUND: Intensive therapy units are the places where pathogens can easily spread. Improper antibiotic therapy contributes to the selection of new strains called multidrug-resistant, extensively drug-resistant or pandrug-resistant. For ITU patients, such pathogens are particularly dangerous. CASE REPORT: The case of a 50-year-old man diagnosed with septic shock after repeated surgeries due to Vater's ampulla tumour was described. In blood and peritoneal fluid cultures, Enterobacter cloacae ESBL and Klebsiella pneumoniae were first isolated; then Acinetobacter baumannii was also detected. The targeted antibiotic therapy instituted did not bring the expected results. On day 5, tigecycline and imipenem were started and continued over 10 days. After 4 days of combined therapy, bacterial strains were eradicated. The patient was sent to the referring ward in good condition. CONCLUSION: Combined use of imipenem and a new antibiotic - tigecycline provides effective treatment of septic shock in the course of intra-abdominal infection.
