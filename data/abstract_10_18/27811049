Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme disease agent, is likely mediated by bacteriophage. Studies of the B. burgdorferi phage, varphiBB-1 and its role in HGT have been hindered by the lack of an assay for readily characterizing phage-mediated DNA movement (transduction). Here we describe an in vitro assay in which a clone of B. burgdorferi strain CA-11.2A encoding kanamycin resistance on a varphiBB-1 prophage is co-cultured with different clones encoding gentamicin resistance on a shuttle vector; transduction is monitored by enumerating colonies selected in the presence of both kanamycin and gentamicin. When both clones used in the assay were derived from CA-11.2A, the frequency of transduction was 1.23 x 10(-6) transductants per cell, and could be increased 5-fold by exposing the phage-producing strain to 5% ethanol. Transduction was also demonstrated between the CA-11.2A clone and clones of both high-passage B. burgdorferi strain B31 and low-passage, virulent B. burgdorferi strain 297, although with lower transduction frequencies. The transductant in the 297 background produced phage capable of transducing another B. burgdorferi clone: this is the first experimental demonstration of transduction from a clone of a virulent strain. In addition to prophage DNA, small Escherichia coli-derived shuttle vectors were also transduced between co-cultured B. burgdorferi strains, suggesting both a broad role for the phage in the HGT of heterologous DNA and a potential use of the phage as a molecular tool. These results enhance our understanding of phage-mediated transduction as a mechanism of HGT in the Lyme disease spirochetes. Furthermore, the reagents and techniques developed herein will facilitate future studies of phage-mediated HGT, especially within the tick vector and vertebrate host.
