An increasing resistance of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) to antimicrobial agents leads to the need of regional monitoring of the prevalence resistant strains (according to the Maastricht/Florence consensus report, 2012). The aim of the study was to assess the resistance to levofloxacin of H. pylori strains isolated from adult patients of Malopolska region in Poland. Bioptates taken from gastric mucosa during gastroscopy constituted the material for the study. Two hundred ten H. pylori strains were isolated from 811 patients. A majority of strains (171) came from patients before the treatment of H. pylori infections while the remaining 39 strains were isolated from patients after the failed therapy. Susceptibility of H. pylori to levofloxacin was determined by strips impregnated with antibiotic gradient (E-test, bioMerieux). The obtained minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranged from 0.002 mg/L to 32 mg/L. The percentage of strains resistant to levofloxacin amounted to 8.10% (17/210). Among the group of strains isolated from patients before the treatment, 5.85% (10/171) of H. pylori strains were resistant to levofloxacin. In the group of strains isolated from patients after the treatment 17.95% (7/39) of strains were resistant. The difference in the frequency of H. pylori strains resistant to levofloxacin in patients before and after the treatment of the infection due to H. pylori was statistically significant (p = 0.0297). The low percentage of H. pylori strains resistant to levofloxacin justify that the introduction of a triple therapy with levofloxacin is a good alternative in the treatment of H. pylori infections, especially in regions with high prevalence of H. pylori strains resistant to clarithromycin (> 20%).
