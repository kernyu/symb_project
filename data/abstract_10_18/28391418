BACKGROUND: The eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection remains a challenge, especially in the patients unsuitable to take penicillin. Cephalosporin has the potential to replace amoxicillin for H. pylori eradication. AIMS: To compare the effectiveness, safety, and compliance of amoxicillin- and cefuroxime-containing quadruple regimens in treatment-naive patients. METHODS: In this open-label randomized control study, 400 patients with H. pylori infection were divided into amoxicillin-containing (esomeprazole 20 mg twice/day, amoxicillin 1000 mg twice/day, levofloxacin 500 mg once/day, and bismuth 220 mg twice/day for 14 days) or cefuroxime-containing (esomeprazole 20 mg twice/day, cefuroxime 500 mg twice/day, levofloxacin 500 mg once/day, and bismuth 220 mg twice/day for 14 days) quadruple therapy groups. The safety and compliance were assessed 1-3 days after eradication. Urea breath test was performed 8-12 weeks after eradication to determine treatment outcome. RESULTS: The baseline data including antibiotic resistance were well matched between the two groups. The eradication rates between amoxicillin- and cefuroxime-containing quadruple therapy groups were not significantly different [intention-to-treat analysis: 83.5% (95% confidence interval 78.3-88.7%) vs. 81.0% (75.5-86.5%), P = 0.513; modified intention-to-treat analysis: 90.3% (86.0-94.6%) vs. 88.5% (83.9-93.2%), P = 0.586; per-protocol analysis: 91.6% (87.5-95.7%) vs. 89.8% (85.3-94.3%), P = 0.560]. The incidence of adverse effects (18.4 vs. 20.1%, P = 0.678) and compliance (94.7 vs. 94.2%, P = 0.813) were also similar. Variate analyses showed that antibiotic resistance and poor compliance were the independent risk factors for eradication failure. CONCLUSIONS: Esomeprazole, bismuth, levofloxacin, and amoxicillin or cefuroxime achieved similar and relatively satisfactory cure rates, safety, and compliance in first-line H. pylori eradication. Cefuroxime may be a good alternative medicine for eradication instead of amoxicillin for the patients unsuitable to take penicillin.
