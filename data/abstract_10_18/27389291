In recent years, MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight) mass spectrometry has become established as a first-line diagnostic tool in the identification of microorganisms, including those producing human infections. Rapid detection of antimicrobial resistance is one of the future applications of this technique with the greatest likelihood of success. This review describes the most important studies published in this field and discusses potential future challenges and the clinical application of this technique in the next few years.
