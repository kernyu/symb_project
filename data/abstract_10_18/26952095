We undertook a 28-year review of enteric fever at a large tertiary care pediatric center. Most cases occurred in children who visited friends and relatives in the Indian subcontinent, and there was significant antibiotic resistance. Documented vaccination rates were low, and many cases also had evidence of delays in diagnosis and treatment.
