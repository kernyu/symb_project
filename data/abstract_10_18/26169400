Additional drugs are needed for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (TB). Sulfamethoxazole has been shown to have in vitro activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis; however, there is concern about resistance given the widespread use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis among HIV-infected patients in sub-Saharan Africa. Thirty-eight of 40 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates (95%) from pretreatment sputum samples from Ugandan adults with pulmonary TB, including HIV-infected patients taking trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis, were susceptible with MICs of </=38.4 mug/ml.
