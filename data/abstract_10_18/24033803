Staphylococcus aureus infections, particularly infections caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains, are emerging as a major public health problem. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of MRSA, antibiotic resistance profile and staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type of MRSA isolates obtained from clinical samples. Totally, 162 S. aureus isolates were obtained from clinical samples at three university hospitals in Kerman, Iran from March 2011 to February 2012. All isolates were identified as S. aureus by phenotypic methods and confirmed by PCR amplification of the nuc gene. MRSA isolates were screened by phenotypic tests and confirmed by presence of mecA gene. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the MRSA isolates against antibacterial agents were determined by E-test. All isolates were analyzed by PCR for the presence of mecA and pvl genes. SCCmec typing of MRSA isolates was performed by multiplex PCR assay. Strain typing was carried out with REP-PCR. Using mecA gene PCR and phenotypic methods, 56.8% of the isolates were identified as MRSA. All MRSA isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and linezolid. The sensitivity of MRSA isolates to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and erythromycin was 70.66, 66.53, 42.4, 38.05, and 29.35%, respectively. The most frequent SCCmec types were type III (48.31%) followed by type V (19.1%), type I (16.85%), and type IV (3.37%). The pvl gene was detected in 3.08% of isolates (two MRSA and three MSSA isolates). REP-PCR typing divided the 92 MRSA isolates into 10 distinct clusters. Our results indicate that vancomycin and linezolid are the most effective antibacterial agents against MRSA isolates and SCCmec type III is predominant in MRSA strains in this area.
