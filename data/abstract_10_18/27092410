A novel series of HIV-1 integrase strand transfer inhibitors were designed using the venerable two-metal binding pharmacophore model and incorporating structural elements from two different literature scaffolds. This manuscript describes a number of 8-hydroxyquinoline tetracyclic lactams with exceptional antiviral activity against HIV-1 and little loss of potency against the IN signature resistance mutations Q148K and G140S/Q148H.
