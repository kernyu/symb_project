The purpose of this study is to examine the use of anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) drugs, such as vancomycin (VCM), teicoplanin (TEIC), arbekasin (ABK) and linezolid (LZD), and the antibiotic susceptibilities of MRSAs in Kobe University Hospital. We investigated MRSA isolation and use of anti-MRSA drugs and susceptibilities of MRSA, using linear regression analysis, from 2007 to 2011, and checked for correlation between the use of these drug and the antibiotic susceptibilities of MRSA. The overall monthly isolation rates of MRSA decreased from a mean of 84.8% in 2007 to 70.0% in 2011 (r=0.946, P=0.015, b=-0.220), and the monthly isolation rate of MRSA in inpatients decreased from a mean of 78.6% in 2007 to 57.7% in 2011 (r=0.952, P=0.012, b=-0.160). From 2007 to 2011, VCM consumption significantly increased (r=0.916, P=0.029, b=0.055), whereas TEIC and LZD use remained stable during the study period. In addition, ABK use significantly decreased from 23.8 defined daily dose (DDD) per 1000 patient-days in 2007 to 5.2 DDD per 1000 in 2011 (r=0.902, P=0.036, b=-0.216). Susceptibility rates of MRSA were almost 100% to TEIC and VCM. The rates of MRSA to ABK and LZD significantly increased (r=0.959, P=0.010, b=2.137 for ABK and r=0.933, P=0.020, b=3.111 for LZD). In conclusion, our findings indicated a decreased MRSA isolation rate and the effective use of anti-MRSA drugs (VCM, TEIC, ABK and LZD), and improved susceptibility rates to anti-MRSA drugs, suggesting the possibilities that appropriate and early use of anti-MRSA drugs may cause the decrease of MRSA isolation.
