The rise of multidrug resistant strains of Salmonella Typhi in the last decade of the previous century led to the use of fluoroquinolones as the drug of choice. However, over the past few years fluoroquinolone resistance has been increasingly reported. In accordance with the revised Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) breakpoints, only 3% of the isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin in comparison to 95% as per the earlier guidelines when 488 isolates collected between 2010 and 2012 were re-interpreted. Interestingly, re-emergence of strains susceptible to chloramphenicol, ampicillin and cotrimoxazole is being seen. Amidst the changing susceptibility profile, azithromycin remains a promising alternative.
