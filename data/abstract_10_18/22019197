OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of cefazolin prophylaxis for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in a hospital with a high prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. METHODS: Since July 1, 2006, we have applied a 'care bundle' to TKA to prevent surgical site infection (SSI) without using vancomycin as antimicrobial prophylaxis, in accordance with the 1999 Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee guidelines. All patients undergoing TKA from July 1, 2006 to September 30, 2009 were enrolled. We reviewed data on SSI collected prospectively as part of routine infection control surveillance. RESULTS: Of 1323 TKAs, an SSI developed in 14 (1.06%) cases, which is comparable to the percentage obtained in other previous reports. When stratified by the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance risk index, SSI rates were 0.86% (8/926), 1.30% (5/384), and 7.69% (1/13) in risk categories 0, 1, and 2, respectively. Of 14 SSIs, four (29%) were classified as superficial incisional, two (14%) as deep incisional, and eight (57%) as organ-space SSI. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that antimicrobial prophylaxis using only cefazolin can maintain low SSI rates if other important infection management measures are employed, even where there is a high prevalence of MRSA infection.
