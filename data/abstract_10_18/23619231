INTRODUCTION: Although platelets are not part of the classical immune system, they have many features that indicate their role in the anti-infective host defense. They come into interactions with microorganisms, which results in co-aggregation and co-adhesion or destruction of the microbes due to the action of antimicrobial peptides released from platelets.The aim of this study was to evaluate the killing effect of platelets against planktonic and biofilm cultures of Staphylococcus aureus and to test their synergy with antibiotics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: S. aureus ATCC 29213; platelet rich plasma (1-3 days post shelf life). Evaluation of bactericidal activity of platelets or their lysates against planktonic cultures of S. aureus--CFU calculation after 4- and 24-hour co-incubation. Assessment of S. aureus biofilm viability under the influence of platelets--Live/Dead(R) BacLight Bacterial Viability Kit. Determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) (oxacillin, vancomycin, linezolid) and estimation of the synergistic action of antibiotics and platelet lysates--a gradient-diffusion test strip. RESULTS: Microbicidal activity of "expired" platelets and their lysates has been shown as a significant reduction in the population of staphylococci in their planktonic cultures by 56-87% and a decrease in metabolic activity of biofilm formation by 7-38%. These activities were enhanced after activation with ADP. Platelet lysates showed a synergistic effect with beta-lactam antibiotic (oxacillin) and glycopeptide (vancomycin) but not with oxazolidinone (linezolid). CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION: In summary, platelets even after the medical expiry date are still a good source of antimicrobial low molecular weight proteins (PMPs). Testing of bacterial resistance to PMPs may be advisable as a predictive indicator of susceptibility to treatment of infections such as infective endocarditis and other local infections of biofilm nature.
