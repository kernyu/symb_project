A neonate with herpes simplex virus 1 encephalitis was treated with intravenous acyclovir. During the course of therapy, the infection became intractable to the treatment and a mutation in the viral thymidine kinase gene (nucleotide G375T, amino acid Q125H) developed. This mutation was demonstrated in vitro to confer acyclovir resistance.
