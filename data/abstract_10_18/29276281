Background: Focus on antimicrobial use and infection prevention from accrediting or regulatory bodies such as the Joint Commission, as well as regulatory agencies such as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Centers for Disease Control, has highlighted the need for continuing development of antimicrobial stewardship programs at healthcare facilities across the country. Methods: Our institution utilized the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology guidelines to direct the evaluation of its antimicrobial use and develop a successful antimicrobial stewardship program. Three baseline evaluations were conducted. Retrospective chart reviews evaluating formulary restrictions for fluroquinolones and carbepenems, a dosing optimization program for meropenem, and the intravenous to oral conversion program for fluconazole and voriconazole were completed. Results: Approximately 40% of orders for levofloxacin were not supported with a clinical justification for nonformulary use in the patient chart. Forty-nine percent of orders written for meropenem did not follow the dose optimization program. Opportunity for fluconazole and voriconazole to be converted to oral therapy when appropriate was suggested. Conclusion: The baseline evaluations revealed the need for an antimicrobial stewardship program. This article outlines the process used to assess need, plan, implement, and evaluate the impact of an antimicrobial stewardship program.
