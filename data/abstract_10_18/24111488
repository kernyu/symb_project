Chlamydiae are obligate intracellular bacteria that cause serious diseases in a wide range of hosts. Chlamydia trachomatis is one of the leading sexually transmitted pathogens in the world. Because vaccines are not currently available, effective drugs are essential. In both animals and humans, chlamydial infections are often treated with tetracycline or its derivatives. A stable tetracycline-resistant phenotype was described in Chlamydia suis strains from pigs in the USA and in Europe. In humans, there are reports of tetracycline treatment failure and the in vitro adaptability of C. trachomatis to evolve to antibiotic resistance has been described, suggesting the pressing need to search for alternative and effective classes of antimicrobial drugs. Host defense peptides (HDPs) are known as direct antimicrobial agents as well as innate immune modulators. Being active against multidrug-resistant bacteria, HDPs are attractive candidates as templates for new drugs. A number of studies evaluated the activity of natural and synthetic HDPs against Chlamydia spp., showing C. trachomatis to be the most sensitive among chlamydia species tested. Protegrins and alpha-helical peptides were the most active among the HDPs assessed.
