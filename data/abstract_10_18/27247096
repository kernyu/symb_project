AIM: Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are a major cause of nosocomial infections with high mortality and morbidity. There is limited data on the molecular characterization of VRE in Saudi Arabia. This study was carried out to investigate the premise that a shift in VRE epidemiology is occurring in our setting. METHODS: Enterococcus species identification and susceptibility testing plus VRE phenotypic confirmation by vancomycin and teicoplanin E-test were carried out. Vancomycin resistance genes were detected by PCR. Strain typing was conducted using PFGE. RESULTS: Among the strains of Enterococcus spp. investigated in this study, 17 (4.5%) were VRE. With the exception of one isolate from rectal swab, all others were clinical specimens with blood being the commonest source (n = 11; 64.7%), followed by urine (n = 3; 17.6%). The 17 VRE isolates were Enterococcus faecium (n/N = 13/17) and Enterococcus gallinarum (n/N = 4/17). Among E. faecium isolates, vanA(+)/vanB(+) (n/N = 8/13; 62%) exhibiting VanB phenotype were predominant. One of the five vanA(+)E. faecium isolates exhibited a VanB phenotype indicative of vanA genotype-VanB phenotype incongruence. E. gallinarum isolates exhibited a Van C phenotype although two were vanA(+)/vanC1(+). PFGE revealed a polyclonal distribution with eight pulsotypes. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate an evolving VRE epidemiology with vanA(+)/vanB(+) isolates and vanA genotype-VanB phenotype incongruence isolates, which were previously described as colonizers, are now causing clinical infection.
