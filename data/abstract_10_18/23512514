Mycobacterium marinum is a rare non-tuberculous mycobacterium known commonly to cause fish tank granuloma. It is found in aquatic surroundings and is common in healthy individuals. We report a case and review the literature in an immunocompromised HIV-1 individual with a first reported case of a rifampicin-resistant M. marinum organism in the literature.
