Brucellosis, a zoonotic infection caused by the genus Brucellae, is an ancient condition linked to the consumption of milk and milk products. The disease has global importance due to its impact. Therapeutic options for brucellosis rely mostly on uncontrolled, nonrandomized, non-blinded studies. The choice and duration of therapy are related to patient characteristics and the presence of a focal disease. The usual therapy of acute brucellosis is a combination of doxycycline plus rifampicin for 6 weeks. An aminoglycoside could be substituted for rifampin for the initial week of combination therapy. Other alternatives include a combination of doxycycline plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or a fluoroquinolone plus rifampicin. The presence of spondylitis or endocarditis usually indicates that the required treatment will be of a longer duration or a combination of therapy. The article has the discussion of some recent patents related to antibiotic susceptibility and Brucellosis.
