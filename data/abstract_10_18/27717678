The culture negative peritonitis in Sudan 2010 was 46% exceeding 20% of the recommended ISPD (International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis) guidelines. This study reports an update after applying the standard ISPD protocol. The routine method was replaced by ISPD protocol. The culture negative rate using the ISPD guidelines dropped from 46% in the year 2010, to 39% in the year 2011, to 5% in the 2012 and to zero percent in the year 2013. Bacterial and fungal species represent (86.76%) and (13.23%) of infection and most isolates showed low resistance rate to antibiotics. Touch contamination added significantly (p=0.0006) to the risk of contracting Peritonitis. The risk of contracting Peritonitis was 1.53 times higher in the group exposed by touch contamination. None of the other risk factors contributed significantly to Peritonitis. The study highlights the importance of implementing high hygiene practice.
