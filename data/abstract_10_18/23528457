The objective of the present work was to study the spectrum of microbiota maintaining the inflammatory process in the cavities of the middle ear of the patients presenting with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) and to estimate its susceptibility to antibiotic agents. The discharge from the ears was subjected to microbiological analysis in 138 patients with CSOM. Some of the microorganisms proved highly sensitive to antibiotic agents. The following etiologically important pathogens involved in the maintenance of the chronic pyoinflamatory process in the cavities of the middle ear were identified: bacteria, fungi, and bacterial-fungal associations that accounted for 66.3%, 6.7%, and 26.9% of all CSOM cases respectively. The former group was dominated by S.aureus (34.6%) whereas the group of non-fermentative Gram-negative species and enterobacteria comprised 16.3% and 15.4% of their total number respectively. The microbiota was shown to be highly susceptible to cephalosporins of the 1st and 2nd generations and fluoroquinolones of the 2nd generation. C. albicans proved highly sensitive to fluconazole while mycelial micromycetes responded fairly well to itracnazole and voriconazole.
