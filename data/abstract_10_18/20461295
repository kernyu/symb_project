Antimicrobial resistance profiles in indicator and zoonotic bacteria isolated from faeces of healthy animals without clinical signs of the following species: bovine, equine, ovine, porcine, layer hens, and canine, were studied. The chosen antimicrobials are frequently used in veterinary and human medicine. The agar diffusion was the method used. The obtained results of 240 Escherichia coli, 189 Enterococcus spp., 11 Campylobacter spp. and 2 Salmonella Gaminara (16:d:1,7) showed a greater percentage of resistance and multiresistance in intensive breeding animals, porcine and layer hens. The observed resistance to ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline and nalidixic acid in E. coli coincides with the antimicrobials most commonly used on animal farms, the same as tetracycline and erythromycin in Enterococcus spp. The strains of Salmonella Gaminara (16:d:1,7) were susceptible to the antimicrobials tested. In Campylobacter spp. the scarce number of isolates hindered an adequate interpretation of the results. Owing to the lack of data in our country on antimicrobial resistance in indicator and zoonotic bacteria in domestic animals, we consider that the obtained values could be used as a starting point for a future monitoring program.
