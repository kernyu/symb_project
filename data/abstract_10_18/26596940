Few oral antibiotics exist for the empirical treatment of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) urinary tract infections (UTI). In this study, we sought to determine the activity of fosfomycin against ESBL-producing uropathogens from patients at 3 Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities between 2010 and 2013. Among the ESBL uropathogens, 19.9% were fosfomycin resistant. Klebsiella species were more likely than Escherichia coli to be resistant (46% versus 4%; P < 0.001). Fosfomycin remains active against a majority of the ESBL uropathogens, although resistance among Klebsiella spp. was higher than that in previous reports.
