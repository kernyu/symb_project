BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli sero-group O25b-sequence type 131 (O25b-ST131), a multidrug-resistant clonal group, is a significant pathogen in adults and children. This study investigated the genotyping and role of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli O25b-ST131 and non-O25b-ST131 in urinary tract infections in infants. METHODS: Clinical and laboratory data from 111 infants less than 1 year of age, who were hospitalized for urinary tract infections caused by ESBL-producing E. coli between 2009 and 2012 were collected. Polymerase chain reactions and multi-locus sequence typing were used to identify E. coli O25-ST131 clones. The gene blaCTX-M groups 1, 2 and 9, a specific polymerase chain reaction of CTX-M 14 and 15, were also determined in ESBL-producing E. coli isolates. RESULTS: O25b-ST131 accounted for 65% of the 111 isolates, although 92 isolates belonged to the blaCTX-M group 9, of which most were CTX-M-14. Those with O25b-ST131 clones had similar risk factors, clinical features and outcomes as those with non-O25b-ST131. The E. coli O25b-ST131 isolates were more resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin, but more susceptible to cefoxitin, minocycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole than the non-O25b-ST131 isolates. Most of the infants (78%) were previously healthy with no apparent risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: E. coli O25b-ST131 is a major community-acquired uropathogen in the infant population. Regardless of O25b-ST131 or non-O25b-ST131 clones, CTX-M-14 accounts for majority of the ESBL genotype. The O25b-ST131 clone is not associated with more severe clinical disease, but it may make the diagnosis and selection of antimicrobials for treatment more challenging.
