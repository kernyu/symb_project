Platensimycin (PTM) and platencin (PTN) are potent and selective inhibitors of bacterial and mammalian fatty acid synthases and have emerged as promising drug leads for both antibacterial and antidiabetic therapies. We have previously cloned and sequenced the PTM-PTN dual biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces platensis MA7327 and the PTN biosynthetic gene cluster from S. platensis MA7339, the latter of which is composed of 31 genes encoding PTN biosynthesis, regulation, and resistance. We have also demonstrated that PTM or PTN production can be significantly improved upon inactivation of the pathway-specific regulator ptmR1 or ptnR1 in S. platensis MA7327 or MA7339, respectively. We now report engineered production of PTN and congeners in a heterologous Streptomyces host. Expression constructs containing the ptn biosynthetic gene cluster were engineered from SuperCos 1 library clones and introduced into five model Streptomyces hosts, and PTN production was achieved in Streptomyces lividans K4-114. Inactivation of ptnR1 was crucial for expression of the ptn biosynthetic gene cluster, thereby PTN production, in S. lividans K4-114. Six PTN congeners, five of which were new, were also isolated from the recombinant strain S. lividans SB12606, revealing new insights into PTN biosynthesis. Production of PTN in a model Streptomyces host provides new opportunities to apply combinatorial biosynthetic strategies to the PTN biosynthetic machinery for structural diversity.
