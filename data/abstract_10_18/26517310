Resistance continues to emerge as a leading cause for antiretroviral treatment failure. Several mutations in HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) confer resistance to non-nucleoside inhibitors (NNRTIs), vital components of antiretroviral combination therapies. Since the majority of mutations are located in the NNRTI binding pocket, crystal structures of RT variants in complex with NNRTIs have provided ideas for new drug design strategies. This article reviews the impact of RT crystal structures on the multidisciplinary design and development of new inhibitors with improved resistance profiles.
