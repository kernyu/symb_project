BACKGROUND: The importance of community-acquired infections due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE) has been increasingly recognized in recent years. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of intestinal carriage of ESBL-PE in the community in Casablanca, Morocco. METHODS: During 6 months (2013), 93 fecal samples were examined for ESBL-PE. Isolates expressing an ESBL phenotype were investigated for the presence of genes encoding beta-lactamases and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance. Conjugation experiments were done to determine the mobility of ESBL genes. RESULTS: The prevalence of fecal carriage of ESBL-PE was 4.3% (4/93; 95% CI, 0.2-8.4). Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 2), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 2), Escherichia coli (n = 1), and Serratia odorifera (n = 1) were the ESBL-producing species. Four (66.7%) of these isolates were multidrug-resistant. The blaSHV-12 (n = 5) was the most frequent ESBL gene detected, followed by blaCTX-M-15 (n = 3).The non-ESBL gene detected was blaTEM-1 (n = 5). One isolate harbored the qnrB1 variant. RESULTS of conjugation experiments indicated that blaSHV-12 + blaTEM-1 + qnrB1 and blaCTX-M-15 + blaTEM-1 genes were co-transferred and that these genes were carried by a conjugative plasmid of high molecular weight (125 kb). CONCLUSION: Our results show the importance of the intestinal tract as a reservoir for ESBL-PE in the community in Morocco.
