The role of antibiotic pressure in the selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is still under debate in the scientific community and often confounded by scarce data on antibiotic usage. Several studies demonstrated that prior antibiotic exposure is likely to increase patient's colonization and infection by antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. Of even more concern is the significant mortality associated with these infections, in particular in critically ill patients. Therefore, the control of antibiotic usage in intensive care units (ICUs) is of paramount importance. Antibiotic stewardship programmes (ASP) have been demonstrated to represent a useful intervention to reduce the inappropriate antibiotic usage in hospitalized patients. A few trials were performed in ICU population with positive results. The major risk we foresee for the implementation of ASP for ICU patients is the lack of consideration of local ecology and strict quality indicators. The development of new pattern of antimicrobial resistance might be ascribed to an inappropriate ASP. European networks to define best strategies and antibiotic-care bundles need to be supported at national and international level. To optimize antibiotic use in the ICU and to fight against the spread of resistance, it is extremely important to adopt a multifaceted approach including ASP.
