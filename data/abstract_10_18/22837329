We aimed to determine whether additional molecular and microbiological evaluations of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolated from patients newly identified as nasal carriers were useful for control strategies and whether longitudinal testing during the same or repeat hospitalization changed MRSA status. Nasal swabs from patients positive by Xpert MRSA PCR and not known to be colonized in the previous year were cultured for S. aureus. Isolates were tested for resistance to a variety of antibiotics, including high-level mupirocin resistance (HLMR) and low-level mupirocin resistance (LLMR) and the presence of genes mecA and mupA and those for Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), USA300, and USA400. Repeat nasal screens during the 6-month study were tested for continued presence of MRSA. Among 130 patients, cultures revealed MRSA in 85 (65.4%), methicillin-susceptible S. aureus in 19 (14.6%), and no growth in 26 (20%). MRSA isolates were USA300 positive in 13/85 (15.3%) and LLMR in 8/85 (9.4%) patients. No isolates were HLMR or mupA positive. mecA dropout was detected in 9/130 (6.9%) patients. The rate of subsequent MRSA infections in USA300-positive versus -negative patients was not different. MRSA nasal status remained concordant in 69/70 (98.6%) patients who had follow-up testing. The findings do not support expanding MRSA surveillance to include routine detection of genes for USA300, PVL, or mupA, all of which were either of low frequency or not significantly associated with MRSA infection risk in our population of newly identified nasal carriers. Repeat nasal screening for MRSA during the same or subsequent hospitalizations over 6 months could also be deferred, reducing costs associated with screening.
