OBJECTIVE: Helicobacter pylori expresses an increased resistance in respect to antimicrobials currently used in therapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial profiles of H. pylori isolates to nine conventional antibiotics used in a Central Region (Abruzzo) of Italy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Biopsies were taken from antrum and fundus of 112 adult and 3 children with Urea Breath Test positive with dyspeptic symptoms and analyzed for H. pylori culture and antibacterial activity. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed for clarithromycin, metronidazole, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, amoxicillin, ampicillin, and rifabutin by a modified agar dilution susceptibility test. RESULTS: Bacterial culture was successful in 100 out of 115 patients. Helicobacter pylori strains were isolated from 98 antrum and 83 fundus samples. The rate of recovery of H. pylori strains was 90.50% (181/200). The percentages of resistance were as follows: clarithromycin 72.44% antrum, 72.28% fundus; metronidazole 34.69% antrum, 42.16% fundus; levofloxacin 42.85% antrum, 53.01% fundus; moxifloxacin 37.35% antrum, 46.57% fundus; ciprofloxacin 39.47% antrum, 44.28% fundus; tetracycline 2.63% antrum, 2.85% fundus; amoxicillin 1.02% antrum, 1.20% fundus; ampicillin 0% antrum and fundus and rifabutin 0% antrum, 1.20% fundus. A total of 35 subjects harbored multi-resistant strains. CONCLUSIONS: This study underlines the high rate of resistance to clarithromycin, metronidazole and quinolones, which may reflect an overuse of them. Culture and susceptibility test, should be performed to prevent the emergence of multi-resistance and to assess an efficacious regimen.
