The incidence of cytomegalovirus retinitis has decreased significantly since the advent of antiretroviral therapy. However, it remains an important problem in both the developed and developing worlds. Furthermore, long-term antiviral suppression is associated with a significant increase in viral resistance. We present the case of a 46-year-old man who developed cytomegalovirus retinitis one year after being diagnosed with HIV. While he initially demonstrated an excellent clinical response to ganciclovir, his cytomegalovirus viral load remained persistently elevated. Over the subsequent years, his virus developed ganciclovir resistance with a concomitant deterioration in his visual acuity. He responded poorly to salvage therapy with foscarnet and cidofovir. This case highlights the ongoing difficulty of managing cytomegalovirus disease nearly two decades into the era of antiretroviral therapy and underlines the need to develop new treatment strategies.
