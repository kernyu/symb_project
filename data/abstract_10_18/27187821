Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) are among the most critical threats facing our healthcare system and account for significant patient mortality. There is considerable interest in the development of new treatment strategies. However, less attention has been paid to reducing CRE infection rates. Antibiotic stewardship programs can be uniquely empowered to reduce widespread pathogen resistance and by extension, optimize patient care and lower healthcare costs.
