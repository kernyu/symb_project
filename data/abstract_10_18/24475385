BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the third most common infection in human. New resisted strains of uropathogens have been developed due to different factors such as widespread use of antibiothics. OBJECTIVES: We conducted this study to assess the recent pattern and susceptibility of uropathogens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional study was carried on 32600 ambulatory patients' urine samples from six laboratories from 2008 to 2010 in Ahvaz, Khuzestan. Of those, 3000 positive culture were found. Data including underlying disease, pregnancy, catheterization and drug history were gathered by questionnaire. Susceptibility of pathogens to eight antimicrobial agents was determined.

Of those, 3000 positive culture were found. Data including underlying disease, pregnancy, catheterization and drug history were gathered by questionnaire. Susceptibility of pathogens to eight antimicrobial agents was determined. RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 33.87 +/- 3.80 years and 84.9% of them were female. The results showed that, E. coli, Kelebsiella and Enterobacter were the most common pathogens (73.5%, 13.8% and 6.6%, respectively). E. coli was susceptible to Ciprofloxacin, Amikacin, and Nitrofurantoin in 76.9%, 76.4% and 76.1% of cases, respectively. Klebsiella was more susceptible to Ciprofloxacin, Ceftizoxim and Amikacin in 81.1%, 79.9% and 87.7% of positive cultures. Enterobacter was most susceptible to Ciprofloxacin (71.7%), but completely resistant to Ampicillin unexpectedly. CONCLUSIONS: E. coli and other isolates were more sensitive to Gentamicin, Amikacin and Ciprofloxacin compared to the other antibiotics tested and therefore these may be the drugs of choice for the empiric treatment of community-acquired UTI in our region.
