Technological and safety-related properties were analyzed in a coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) collection isolated from Spanish dry-cured meat products in order to use them as starter cultures. The highest nitrate reductase and proteolytic activity was showed by Staphylococcus carnosus and Staphylococcus equorum. Only a few strains were able to form biofilms and the presence of the ica gene was analyzed on them. In relation to antibiotic resistance, all S. carnosus and most of the S. equorum strains were sensitive to the antibiotics tested and the presence of the blaZ gene in the beta-lactamic resistant strains was studied. Biogenic amines were produced by 25% of the strains analyzed being all the S. carnosus strains tyramine producers. Taking into account the studied properties, two S. equorum strains could be selected as adequate and safe potential starter cultures for the elaboration of meat products.
