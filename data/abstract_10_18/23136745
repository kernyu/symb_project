The Kluyveromyces species reassigned to the genera Lachancea and Vanderwaltozyma are insensitive to five mycocins secreted by Pichiamembranifaciens. The remaining Kluyveromyces species including species transferred to the genera Kazachstania, Nakaseomyces, and Tetrapisispora are sensitive to them. Only the neotype strain is insensitive to mycocins among Kluyveromyceslactis cultures.
