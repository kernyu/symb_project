The objective of this study was to develop a DNA sequencing assay that examines sensitively and reliably all conserved domains of the reverse transcriptase-encoding region of the HBV genome for antiviral resistance-associated mutations while simultaneously producing ample information for precise genotyping and determination of HBsAg mutation. This assay was used to examine 1000 de-identified HBV DNA positive samples with known viral loads from a broad-based, unselected patient population from across the United States. Of these, 946 were assayed successfully. Antiviral resistance-associated mutations were identified in 104 samples. The escape mutation sG145R in the surface antigen was identified in 0.8% of patient samples. Infections with genotypes A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H were observed in 36.6%, 19.6%, 21.7%, 13.5%, 3.6%, 0.7%, 2.2%, and 0.5% of patient samples respectively. Fifteen samples (1.6%) appeared to harbor infections with multiple genotypes as shown by the presence of double peaks throughout sequence electropherograms. The limit of detection of this assay was approximately 150IU/mL.
