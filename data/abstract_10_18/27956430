There are conflicting data on the association of vancomycin MIC (VAN-MIC) with treatment outcomes in Staphylococcus aureus infections. We investigated the relationship between high VAN-MIC and 30-day mortality and identified the risk factors for mortality in a large cohort of patients with invasive S. aureus (ISA) infections, defined as the isolation of S. aureus from a normally sterile site. Over a 2-year period, 1,027 adult patients with ISA infections were enrolled in 10 hospitals, including 673 (66%) patients with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections. There were 200 (19.5%) isolates with high VAN-MIC (>/=1.5 mg/liter) by Etest and 87 (8.5%) by broth microdilution (BMD). The all-cause 30-day mortality rate was 27.4%. High VAN-MIC by either method was not associated with all-cause 30-day mortality, and this finding was consistent across MIC methodologies and methicillin susceptibilities. We conclude that high VAN-MIC is not associated with increased risk of all-cause 30-day mortality in ISA infections. Our data support the view that VAN-MIC alone is not sufficient evidence to change current clinical practice.
