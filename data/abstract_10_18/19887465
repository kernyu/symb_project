BACKGROUND: Peripheral T-cell lymphoma unspecified (PTCLU) and mycosis fungoides (MF) often show resistance to conventional chemotherapy. Gemcitabine should be considered a suitable option. We report the long-term update of 39 pretreated T-cell lymphoma patients treated with gemcitabine. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From May 1997 to September 2007, 39 pretreated MF and PTCLU patients received gemcitabine. Inclusion criteria were as follows: histologic diagnosis of MF or PTCLU; relapsed/refractory disease; age > or =18 years; and World Health Organization performance status of two or less. Nineteen patients had MF and 20 PTCLU. All patients with MF had a T3-T4, N0, and M0 disease and patients with PTCLU had stage III-IV disease. Gemcitabine was given on days 1, 8, and 15 on a 28-day schedule (1200 mg/m(2)/day) for a total of three to six cycles. RESULTS: Overall response rate was 51% (20 of 39 patients); complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) rates were 23% (9 of 39 patients) and 28% (11 of 39 patients), respectively. Patients with MF had a CR rate of 16% and a PR rate of 32% compared with a CR rate of 30% and a PR rate of 25% of PTCLU patients. Among the CR patients, 7 of 9 are in continuous complete response with a variable disease-free interval (15-120 months). CONCLUSION: In our experience, gemcitabine proved to be effective in pretreated MF and PTCLU patients, even in the long term.
