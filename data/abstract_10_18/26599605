Type I dehydroquinase (DHQ1) is a class I aldolase enzyme that catalyzes the reversible dehydration of 3-dehydroquinic acid to form 3-dehydroshikimic acid by multistep mechanism that involves the formation of Schiff-base species. DHQ1 is present in plants and several bacterial sources but it does not have any counterpart in human cells. It has been suggested that DHQ1 may act as a virulence factor in vivo and therefore a promising target in the search for new antivirulence agents to combat widespread antibiotic resistance. This review covers recent progress in the structure-based design and chemical modifications caused by selective irreversible inhibitors. Computational studies aimed at understanding the experimentally obtained covalent modifications and inhibitory potencies of these inhibitors are also described.
