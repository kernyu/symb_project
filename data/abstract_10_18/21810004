OBJECTIVE: To develop a hard coating for stainless surfaces based on silver (Ag)-platinum (Pt) alloys. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ag-Pt alloys, which have high degree of biocompatibility, excellent resistance to sterilization conditions, and antibacterial properties to different bacteria, are associated with long-term antibacterial efficiency. Approximately 1.03-microm to 2.34-microm-thick coatings, as determined by scanning electron microscopy, were deposited on stainless surfaces by the simultaneous vaporization of both metals (Ag and Pt) in an inert argon atmosphere. The coating was done by physical vapor deposition. Microorganisms and eukaryotic culture cells were grown on these surfaces. RESULTS: The coatings released sufficient Ag ions when immersed in phosphate-buffered saline and showed significant antimicrobial potency against Streptococcus mutans and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans strains. At the same time, human gingival fibroblast cells were not adversely affected. CONCLUSION: Ag-Pt coatings on load-bearing orthodontic bracket surfaces can provide suitable antimicrobial activity during active orthodontic treatment.
