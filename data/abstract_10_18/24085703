Staphylococcus aureus is an important pathogen linked to serious infections both in the hospital and the community settings. The challenge to treat infections caused by S. aureus has increased because of the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). A limited spectrum of antibiotics is available to treat MRSA infections. This chapter reviews antimicrobial agents currently in use for the treatment of MRSA infections as well as agents that are in various stages of development. This chapter also reviews the alternate approaches that are being explored for the treatment of staphylococcal infections.
