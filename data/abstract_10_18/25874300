The prevalence of hospital strains of P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae characterizing by multiple drug resistance to overwhelming majority of antibiotics anew evoked an increased interest to colistin. However, until now there is not enough information concerning pharmacokinetics of colistin to optimize dosage of this pharmaceutical. The study was carried out to analyze pharmacokinetics of both colistin and sodium colistimitate in children with chemically induced neutropenia. To quantitatively detect colistin in blood serum the technique of highly effective fluid chromatography with mass spectrometry was applied. The concentration of colistin was detected in 21 children with chemically induced neutropenia (13 patients with septicemia, 8 children of control group) after intravenous injection of sodium colistimitate. The significant variability of pharmacokinetic parameters of colistin was established both in patients with septicemia and in control group. The technique of highly effective fluid chromatography with mass spectrometry can be applied for therapeutic medicinal monitoring and optimization regimen of dosage.
