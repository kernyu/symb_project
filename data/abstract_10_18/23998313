This study investigated antibiotic resistance profiles including antibiotic resistance frequencies, resistance genes and resistance patterns in Escherichia coli strains isolated from traditional and integrated aquaculture systems in South China by using antibiotic susceptibility testing and real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. The E. coli isolates were found to be resistant to at least one antibiotic among 12 antibiotics. Higher resistance frequencies to ampicillin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprime, streptomycin and tetracycline were found compared to the rest antibiotics. Among the 10 tetracycline resistance genes detected in the resistant isolates, the most prevalent tetracycline resistance genes were tetA, tetW and tetB with the frequency of 69.7%, 63.5% and 21.9%, respectively. Three sulfonamide resistance genes were detected in these resistant isolates, with their detection frequencies in the following order: sul2 (55.3%) > sul3 (28.2%) > sul1 (6.2%). Four resistance genes mainly encoding extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were detected in these resistant isolates, with the detection frequencies of blaTEM (28.4%) > blaOXA (9.7%) > blaCTX (9.3%) > blaCARB (5.2%) > blaSHV (0.0%). It was found that the integrated aquaculture system exhibited generally higher prevalence of antibiotic resistance than the traditional aquaculture system. An integrated aquaculture system could facilitate development of bacterial resistance and spread of the antibiotic resistance genes, and consequently become an important reservoir of resistance genes.
