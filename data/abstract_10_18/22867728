Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) causes nosocomial and community-associated infections, representing significant healthcare concerns. Limited studies have investigated cervicovaginal MRSA colonization and antibiotic susceptibility. Upon comparing clinical cervicovaginal MRSA isolates to nonvaginal isolates by Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome mec type, presence of Panton-Valentine Leukocidin toxin, antibiotic susceptibility, and presence of associated resistance genes, no significant differences were observed between the anatomical sites, but were observed between our hospital- and community-associated MRSA isolates. There was a significant increase in erythromycin resistance in our vaginal MRSA isolates compared to previous vaginal MRSA reports and an increase in clindamycin, doxycycline, and mupirocin resistance in our nonvaginal MRSA isolates compared to previously reported community-based skin and soft tissue MRSA isolates. Additionally, this is the first report of mupirocin resistance in vaginal MRSA isolates.
