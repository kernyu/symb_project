Bacterial pneumonia is a common and often life-threatening respiratory problem in both meat and dairy goats. Options for approved antibiotic therapy in goats to combat these bacterial infections are severely limited and frequently drugs must be used in an extra-label manner. Tulathromycin, a triamilide macrolide antimicrobial drug shown to be effective against swine and cattle respiratory bacterial agents, has been identified as a potentially useful drug in caprines. The present study was conducted to determine the susceptibility of recognized bacterial respiratory pathogens to commonly prescribed antimicrobials, with a particular emphasis on the efficacy of tulathromycin against these agents. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing using microbroth dilution was performed on a collection of 45 Mannheimia haemolytica, 11 Pasteurella multocida, and 11 Bibersteinia trehalosi isolates from the lungs of goats with clinical pneumonia. To further characterize efficacy of tulathromycin against these pathogens, minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) testing and kinetic killing assays were conducted. Most isolates were susceptible to the antimicrobials tested; however, increased resistance as demonstrated by higher MIC values was seen in all species to penicillin, in P. multocida to sulfadimethoxine, and in B. trehalosi to the tetracyclines. All isolates were susceptible to tulathromycin, which demonstrated a high killing efficiency in both bactericidal assays. Results of this study indicate that most goat pneumonic bacterial pathogens remain susceptible to commonly prescribed antibiotics, although some evidence of resistance was seen to certain drugs; and that tulathromycin is highly effective against goat respiratory pathogens which could make it a valuable medication in this species.
