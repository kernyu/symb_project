INTRODUCTION: Bacterial resistance is a global concern for public health. Reports of antimicrobial resistance, including that against methicillin, have increased in strains of coagulase positive Staphylococcus (CPS) isolated from pets, however in Chile this information is limited. OBJECTIVES: To determine the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles and to detect the mecA gene in CPS strains isolated from cats in Chile. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 134 samples were obtained from healthy cats and cats with skin lesions. These strains were characterized in their coagulase production and identified by BBL Crystal kit. The antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by Kirby Bauer method against 12 antimicrobials, including oxacillin. All strains were subjected to PCR to detect the mecA gene. RESULTS: 72 CPS strains were isolated, including S. aureus and S. intermedius. Antimicrobial resistance against at least one drug was detected in strains from both healthy cats (75%) and from cats with skin lesions (87.5%). The mecA gene was detected in eight methicillin-resistant strains and also in three sensitive strains, being in general multi-resistant. DISCUSSION: These results highlight the role of pets as reservoirs of bacterial resistance, and their potential impact on national public health.
