INTRODUCTION: Inpatient treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs) exerts a significant economic burden on the healthcare system. Oritavancin is a concentration-dependent, rapid bactericidal agent approved for the treatment of ABSSSIs. Its prolonged half-life with one-time intravenous (i.v.) dosing offers a potential solution to this burden. In addition, oritavancin represents an alternative therapy for Streptococci and multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus. Animal models have also shown promising results with oritavancin for other disease states including those that require long courses of i.v. THERAPY: AREAS COVERED: This review covers oritavancin's basic chemistry, spectrum of activity, pharmacodynamics/pharmacokinetics and efficacy in clinical trials, and provides expert opinion on future directions. To compose this review, a search of PubMed was performed, and articles written in the English language were selected based on full text availability. EXPERT OPINION: If oritavancin is proven to be a cost-effective strategy for outpatient treatment and prevents complications of prolonged i.v. therapy, it will be sought as an alternative antibiotic therapy for ABSSSIs. In addition, further clinical data demonstrating efficacy in Gram-positive infections requiring prolonged therapy such as endocarditis and osteomyelitis could support oritavancin's success in the current market.
