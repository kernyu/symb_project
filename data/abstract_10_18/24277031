Fifty-seven carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates belonging to ST11 (50 isolates), ST423 (5 isolates), and two other sequence types were studied. All were positive for blaKPC-2, blaTEM-1, and blaCTX-M-14. SDS-PAGE analysis of six representative isolates demonstrated varied porin expression. Nevertheless, when blaKPC-2 was deleted, carbapenem resistance was markedly reduced. Additionally, SHV-12, DHA-1, and/or VIM-1 appeared to contribute to accessory carbapenemase activity. In contrast, OmpK35 and/or OmpK36 deficiency seemed to serve only as a minor cooperative factor.
