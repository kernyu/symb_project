BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Multidrug resistant methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a major cause of nosocomial and community acquired infections and is on the rise. The glycopeptide vancomycin has been proposed as the drug of choice for treating such infections. The present study aimed at identifying the vancomycin resistance both phenotypically and genotypically among the MRSA isolates from two tertiary care hospitals in Hyderabad, south India. METHODS: MRSA were isolated and identified from different clinical samples collected from ICUs of tertiary care hospitals in Hyderabad using conventional methods. Antibiogram of the isolates and vancomycin MIC were determined following CLSI guidelines. vanA was amplified by PCR using standard primers. RESULTS: All vancomycin resistant S. aureus (VRSA) isolates were MRSA. The VRSA isolates were positive for vanA gene, except one which was negative. All VRSA had a vancomycin MIC in the range of 16-64 mg/l. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The increase in vancomycin resistance among MRSA and excessive use of antimicrobial agents have worsened the sensitivity. Larger studies need to be done in various geographical regions of the country to better define the epidemiology, mechanism of vancomycin resistance in S. aureus and its clinical implications.
