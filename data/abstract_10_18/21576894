Staphylococcus aureus is among the most prevalent pathogens isolated from hospitalized patients; those infected with methicillin-resistant strains have longer hospital stays and higher total costs compared with those infected by methicillin-susceptible strains. A multidisciplinary team of health care providers, including hospitalists and other hospital-based physicians, clinical pharmacists, infectious disease specialists, infection control professionals, and case managers, is key to improving treatment and outcomes in these patients. Optimizing transitions of care for hospitalized patients with S aureus infections can improve quality and reduce total costs of care. Hospital length of stay can be shortened by initiating timely, appropriate empiric therapy and by transitioning suitable patients to outpatient antimicrobial therapy. The number of hospitalizations can be reduced by identifying patients who are suitable candidates for initial outpatient antimicrobial therapy. Consistent with good antimicrobial stewardship, the risk of resistance can be minimized by de-escalating empiric therapy to a more narrow-spectrum agent once culture and susceptibility testing results are known. There are several antimicrobial agents available for the management of S aureus infections, including methicillin-resistant S aureus. Consideration of these agents' characteristics may facilitate optimal transition of patients through health care settings.
