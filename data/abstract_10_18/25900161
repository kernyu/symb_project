OBJECTIVES: There are different methodological recommendations for in vitro testing of the co-amoxiclav combination. Performance of co-amoxiclav MIC testing for Escherichia coli by the standard ISO microdilution method (ISO 20776-1) was compared using EUCAST (fixed 2 mg/L clavulanate concentration) and CLSI (2 : 1 ratio) interpretive criteria. METHODS: MICs were determined by broth microdilution using a 2 : 1 ratio and fixed clavulanate concentrations (2 and 4 mg/L) for 160 clinical E. coli isolates with characterized resistance mechanisms. Essential agreements, categorical agreements and relative errors were determined. RESULTS: For all isolates, essential agreement between microdilution using 2 mg/L clavulanate and a 2 : 1 ratio was 25.6%. For ESBL-producing isolates, considering EUCAST breakpoints, 55% of isolates tested with 2 mg/L clavulanate were classified as resistant; conversely, 95% of isolates tested with 4 mg/L clavulanate were susceptible. When using CLSI breakpoints and a 2 : 1 ratio, 90% of isolates were susceptible and 10% were intermediate. CONCLUSIONS: Variation in the clavulanate concentration gave different susceptibility testing results, particularly among ESBL-producing E. coli isolates. The in vitro concentration of clavulanate that better correlates with clinical outcome is still under debate and should be established.
