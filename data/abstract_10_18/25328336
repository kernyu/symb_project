BACKGROUND: The infections caused by metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa are associated with higher rates of mortality, morbidity, and overall healthcare costs compared to non-MBL P. aeruginosa infections. PURPOSE: To compare the epidemiologic factors and antibiograms of MBL-positive and MBL-negative P. aeruginosa isolates in a tertiary care hospital. METHODS: In an observational study, from January 2011 to December 2012, all non-duplicate P. aeruginosa isolates were subjected to an antimicrobial sensitivity test against 10 antibiotics of five different classes. All P. aeruginosa strains showing resistance to at least one of the carbapenems were subjected to the MBL-E test. Epidemiological features and antibiograms of MBL-positive and MBL-negative strains were compared and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Out of 350 isolates (total sample = 5330) of P. aeruginosa, MBL was detected in 58 isolates by the E-test, resulting in a prevalence of 16.57%. Resistance to most of the antibiotics was significantly higher in the MBL-positive strains with 100% resistance to ciprofloxacin, tobramycin, and meropenem, followed by imipenem (93.10%) and gentamicin (89.66%). The prevalence of multidrug-resistant and pandrug-resistant strains was significantly higher among the MBL group as compared to that in the non-MBL group ((55.17 vs. 7.88% (P < 0.0001) and 8.62 vs. 0.68% (P = 0.0006)), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: MBL-positive P. aeruginosa strains showed very high resistance to various antibiotics, as compared to the non-MBL strains. Increasing prevalence of MBL-producing isolates in hospital settings makes it important to perform routine detection of MBL-positive P. aeruginosa strains by in vitro testing before antibiotic use, for the purposes of infection prevention, and control, and for minimizing the adverse outcomes of infections with MBL-producing strains.
