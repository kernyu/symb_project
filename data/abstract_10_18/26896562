Pathogenic microbial biofilm, a consortium of microbial cells protected by a self-produced polymer matrix, is considered a worldwide challenge due to the inherent antibiotic resistance conferred by its lifestyle. Living, as it does, in a community of microbial organisms in a clinical situation, makes it responsible for severe and dangerous cases of infection. Combating this organisation of cells usually requires high antibiotic doses for a prolonged time, and these approaches often fail, contributing to infection persistence. In addition to therapeutic limitations, biofilms can be a source of infections when they grow in medical devices. The challenge imposed by biofilms has mobilised researchers in the entire world to prospect or develop alternatives to control biofilms. In this context, this review summarises the new frontiers that could be used in clinical circumstances in order to prevent or eliminate pathogenic biofilms.
