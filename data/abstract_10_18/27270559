Rifamycins inhibit RNA polymerase of most bacterial genera. Rifampicin remains part of combination therapy for treating tuberculosis (TB), and for treating Gram-positive prosthetic joint and valve infections, in which biofilms are prominent. Rifabutin has use for AIDS patients in treating mycobacterial infections TB and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), having fewer drug-drug interactions that interfere with AIDS medications. Rifabutin is occasionally used in combination to eradicate Helicobacter pylori (peptic ulcer disease). Rifapentine has yet to fulfill its potential in reducing time of treatment for TB. Rifaximin is a monotherapeutic agent to treat gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, such as hepatic encephalopathy, irritable bowel syndrome, and travelers' diarrhea. Rifaximin is confined to the GI tract because it is not systemically absorbed on oral dosing, achieving high local concentrations, and showing anti-inflammatory properties in addition to its antibacterial activity. Resistance issues are unavoidable with all the rifamycins when the bioburden is high, because of mutations that modify RNA polymerase.
