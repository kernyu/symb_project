This report examines the effectiveness of antimicrobial restriction at 1 tertiary care health care system by analyzing the consumption of restricted versus nonrestricted gram-positive agents over time for medical versus surgical units. Significant reductions in restricted antibiotic use were detected in 57% of medical units versus none of the surgical units. There were no significant reductions in nonrestricted antibiotic use. We think looking at antibiotic consumption by service line provides opportunities for targeted antibiotic restriction program refinement.
