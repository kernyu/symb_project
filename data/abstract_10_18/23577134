A total of 874 fecal specimens (446 diarrheal cases and 428 controls) from diarrheal children admitted in the Infectious Diseases Hospital, Kolkata and age and sex matched asymptomatic subjects from an urban community were assessed for the prevalence of enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF). Isolates of B. fragilis were tested for the presence of enterotoxin gene (bft) by PCR. The detection rate of ETBF was 7.2% (63 of 874 specimens) that prevailed equally in diarrheal cases and controls (7.2% each; 32 of 446 cases and 31 of 428 controls). Male children up to one year age group was significantly (p<0.05) associated with ETBF infection as compared to children > 2 years of age in cases and controls. In 25 ETBF isolates, the bft gene was genotyped using PCR-RFLP and only two alleles were identified with prevalence rate of 40% and 60% for bft-1 and bft-3, respectively. All the ETBF isolates were susceptible for chloramphenicol and imipenem but resistant to clindamycin (48%), moxifloxacin (44%) and metronidazole (32%). Resistance of ETBF to moxifloxacin (44%) and metronidazole is an emerging trend. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) revealed that majority of the ETBF isolates are genetically diverse. In the dendrogram analysis, two clusters were identified, one with ETBF resistant to 5-8 antimicrobials and the other cluster with metronidazole and moxifloxacin susceptible isolates from diarrheal cases. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed report on ETBF from India indicating its clinical importance and molecular characteristics.
