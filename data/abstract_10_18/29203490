beta-Lactams are often used to treat Helicobacter cinaedi infections; however, the mechanism underlying beta-lactam resistance is unknown. In this study, we investigated beta-lactam resistance in an H. cinaedi strain, MRY12-0051 (MICs of amoxicillin [AMX] and ceftriaxone [CRO], 32 and 128 mug/ml; obtained from human feces). Based on a comparative whole-genome analysis of MRY12-0051 and the CRO-susceptible H. cinaedi strain MRY08-1234 (MICs of AMX and CRO, 1 and 4 mug/ml; obtained from human blood), we identified five mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), including two in pbpA, one in pbp2, and two in ftsI Transformation and penicillin binding assays indicated that CRO resistance was mainly associated with mutations in pbpA; mutations in ftsI also led to increased resistance to AMX. Knocking out cmeB and cmeD, which encode resistance-nodulation-division-type efflux pump components, in H. cinaedi type strain CCUG18818 (AMX MIC, 4 to 8 mug/ml) resulted in 8- and 64-fold decreases, respectively, in the AMX MIC. Hence, MICs of AMX in H. cinaedi become similar to those of Helicobacter pylori isolates in the absence of cmeD In conclusion, the difference in susceptibility to beta-lactams between H. pylori and H. cinaedi is explained by differences in efflux pump components. Mutations in pbpA are the primary determinant of high resistance to beta-lactams in H. cinaedi.
