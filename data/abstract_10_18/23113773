INTRODUCTION: Acinetobacter spp. are important pathogens increasingly reported as the cause of outbreaks of nosocomial infections. The aim of our study was to identify the risk factors and assess their influence on outcomes in patients with infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. METHODS: A retrospective data analysis was performed to evaluate risk factors and mortality in patients with Acinetobacter spp. infections. Methods used for the statistical analysis were the Student's t-test, Chi-square test, and multivariate analysis; p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 99 patients with an Acinetobacter spp. infection were identified. Comparing patients with carbapenem-sensitive and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. infection, significant differences were found in the mean length of intensive care unit stay (4.17 +/- 3.61 vs 7.92 +/- 6.74 days, p = 0.038) and mechanical ventilation (3.25 +/- 2.61 and 7.07 +/- 5.79 days, p = 0.009). The previous use of carbapenems (odds ratio (OR) 10.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16-87.20) and fluoroquinolones (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.13-11.51) was independently associated with resistance to carbapenems. Of the Acinetobacter spp. strains, 94.9% (n = 94) were resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam, 88.9% (n = 88) to ceftazidime, 85.9% (n = 85) to ciprofloxacin, 83.8% (n = 83) to gentamicin, 79.8 (n = 79) to amikacin, and 48.5% (n = 48) to cefepime. CONCLUSIONS: Intensive care unit stay before infection and source of infection in the respiratory tract were independently associated with patient mortality. Resistance to carbapenems had no impact on mortality rates. Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. isolates had high resistance rates to other antimicrobial drugs.
