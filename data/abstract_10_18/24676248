The incidence of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) increases with age and is associated with an elevated morbimortality due to the physiological changes associated with aging and a greater presence of chronic disease. Taking into account the importance of this disease from an epidemiological and prognostic point of view, and the enormous heterogeneity described in the clinical management of the elderly, we believe a specific consensus document regarding this patient profile is necessary. The purpose of the present work was to perform a review of the evidence related to the risk factors for the etiology, the clinical presentation, the management and the treatment of CAP in elderly patients with the aim of elaborating a series of specific recommendations based on critical analysis of the literature. This document is the fruit of the collaboration of different specialists representing the Spanish Society of Emergency Medicine and Emergency Care (SEMES), the Spanish Society of Geriatrics and Gerontology (SEGG), the Spanish Society of Chemotherapy (SEQ), the Spanish Society of Internal Medicine (SEMI), the Spanish Society of Pneumology and Thoracic Surgery (SEPAR) and the Spanish Society of Home Hospitalization (SEHAD).
