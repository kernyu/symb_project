The aim of this retrospective, observational study was to evaluate the outcomes of bacteremia attacks during neutropenic episodes caused by chemotherapy in patients with hematological cancers by assessing mortality, involved pathogens, antimicrobial therapy and treatment responses. Patients who were older than 14 years of age and developed at least one neutropenic episode after chemotherapy to treat hematological cancer between November 2011 and November 2012 were included in the study. We retrospectively collected demographic, treatment, and survival data for 68 patients with 129 neutropenic episodes. The mean age was 59.36 +/- 15.22 years (range 17-80 years), and 41 cases were male. The mean Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer score was 19.56 +/- 9.04. A total of 37 (28 %) bacteremia attacks were recorded in 20 cases (29 %). Fatality rates were 50 % in the six cases with bacteremia caused by carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria; death occurred in two patients with carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and in one patient with carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Clinical and microbiological responses were achieved using PIP-TAZ or CEP-SUL treatment in 80 % (16/20) of the cases with bacteremia caused by carbapenem-sensitive Gram-negative bacteria (CS-GNB). During 547 colonization-days in 21 (30 %) vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE)-colonized cases among 68 patients, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium bacteremia developed in two patients. Non-carbapenem-based therapy can cure most bacteremia attacks caused by CS-GNB in patients with hematological cancer. However, bacteremia and other infections caused by drug-resistant pathogens, such as A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, and VRE, are a growing concern in hematological patients.
