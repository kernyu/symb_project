BACKGROUND: ARIEL (Darunavir in treatment-experienced pediatric population) was a phase II, open-label study assessing safety and antiviral activity of darunavir/ritonavir twice daily with an optimized background regimen (OBR) in treatment-experienced, HIV-1-infected pediatric patients (3 to <6 years, weighing 10 to <20 kg). METHODS: The study consisted of an initial 4-week screening period, 48 weeks of treatment and a 4-week follow-up period. Patients initially received darunavir/ritonavir 20/3 mg/kg twice-daily for 2 weeks. Following review of pharmacokinetic, safety and antiviral data, the doses of darunavir/ritonavir were adjusted to 25/3 mg/kg twice-daily for patients <15 kg, and 375/50 mg twice-daily for patients 15 to <20 kg. RESULTS: Of the 34 patients screened, 21 were treated (median treatment duration 48.6 weeks). Darunavir plus an OBR was well tolerated over 48 weeks, with no new safety concerns, and a comparable safety profile to that seen in older children and adults. All treatment-emergent lipid-related and glucose-related laboratory abnormalities were grade 1 or 2. At week 48, 17 of 21 patients (81.0%) had a confirmed virologic response (intent-to-treat, time-to-loss of virologic response). Improvements in height and weight were seen during the study. CONCLUSIONS: No new safety concerns were observed over a 48 week period. These results led to lowering the age to 3 years at which darunavir/ritonavir is indicated for use in treatment-experienced pediatric patients. This study also established doses of darunavir to use in treatment-experienced, HIV-1-infected patients aged 3 to <6 years. A high virologic response was observed with this dose. No development of resistance was observed in patients who experienced virologic failure.
