A novel defensin-like antimicrobial peptide named longicornsin was isolated from the salivary glands of the hard tick, Haemaphysalis longicornis, using a 10-kDa cut-off Centriprep filter and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Its amino acid sequence was determined as DFGCGQGMIFMCQRRCMRLYPGSTGFCRGFRCMCDTHIPLRPPFMVG by Edman degradation. The cDNA encoding longicornsin was cloned by cDNA library screening. The predicted protein from the cDNA sequence was composed of 78 amino acids including a mature longicornsin. It showed similarity with defensin-like peptides from other ticks by BLAST search. Different from most other tick defensin-like peptides, longicornsin had a C-terminal extension. Purified longicornsin exerted potent antimicrobial activities against bacteria and fungi. Interestingly, it even showed strong antimicrobial ability against drug-resistant microorganisms and Helicobacter pylori. The results of this study indicated that longicornsin is a potential candidate for novel antimicrobial drug design.
