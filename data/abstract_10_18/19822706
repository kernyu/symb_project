The transport characteristics of six fluoroquinolones (FQs) with various lipophilicities were compared in a Calu-3 cell model. For each FQ, an active polarized transport was observed in the direction of the apical side. However, the apparent permeability of FQs resulted from active transport and passive diffusion that were highly variable between compounds and mainly governed by lipophilicity. Therefore, active transport was predominant for compounds with relatively low lipophilicity but minor for FQs with higher lipophilicity.
