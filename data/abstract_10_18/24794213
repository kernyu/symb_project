BACKGROUND: The incidence of candidemia due to non-Candida albicans Candida species has been progressively increasing in recent years. The use of fluconazole as antifungal prophylaxis has been described as a risk factor for the development of infections by fluconazole resistant Candida strains. We report a case of Candida norvegensis bloodstream infection in a liver transplant recipient. CASE REPORT: A 61-year-old man, who received a third liver allograft and became worse with the onset of ischemic cholangiopathy and recurrent episodes of cholangitis, was admitted to our hospital due to the development of intra-abdominal abscesses. He received multiple antibiotic schemes, and after 3 months he was discharged, maintaining parenteral antibiotic at home. While he was on fluconazole prophylaxis, a breakthrough candidemia due to C. norvegensis occurred. In vitro susceptibilities of the isolate to several antifungal agents were as follows: amphotericin B MIC 0.5 mg/l, flucytosine 64 mg/l, fluconazole 64 mg/l, itraconazole 4 mg/l, voriconazole 0.75 mg/l, and caspofungin 0.047 mg/l. He was treated with anidulafungin with resolution of candidemia. CONCLUSIONS: The use of fluconazole for antifungal prophylaxis may lead to the emergence of fluconazole-resistant Candida infections, with C. norvegensis being a possible emerging pathogen in organ transplant recipients.
