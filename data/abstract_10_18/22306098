Extra-intestinal infections caused by Clostridium difficile are uncommon. We report a case of a mycotic abdominal aortic aneurysm in an 86-year old male. Tissue and pus swabs from the aneurysmal sac grew a pure growth of C. difficile. The identity of the isolate was determined by phenotypic methods and confirmed by DNA sequencing. He was treated successfully with an aorta-bifemoral bypass and a 4-week course of intravenous and oral antibiotics.
