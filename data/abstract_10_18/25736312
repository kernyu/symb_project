Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD) with activity in lymphoid malignancies occurring primarily through immune modulation (eg, T-cell immune synapse enhancement and NK-cell/T-cell effector augmentation) and antiproliferative effects. Food and Drug Administration-approved for bortezomib-resistant, relapsed/refractory mantle-cell lymphoma, lenalidomide has demonstrated efficacy in several additional lymphoma subtypes. There are many ongoing clinical trials examining the use of lenalidomide alone or in combinatorial therapy. It will be important in these studies to delineate reliable, predictive biomarkers to optimally integrate lenalidomide into lymphoma treatment paradigms.
