We report the case of a young female lung transplant recipient with difficult-to-treat cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease. While treatment with intravenous (IV) ganciclovir failed due to antiviral drug resistance, a trial with foscarnet resulted in severe side effects. In addition, the patient received IV CMV-specific immune globulins as adjunctive therapy and leflunomide as experimental therapy. In this context, CMV-specific immune monitoring was performed and was successfully implemented in management decisions. The patient was screened for acquisition of an adaptive immune response, and antiviral prophylaxis and therapy was tailored according to results. This report highlights the impact of CMV-specific immune monitoring on individualized therapy for appropriate prophylaxis and management of CMV infection and diseases.
