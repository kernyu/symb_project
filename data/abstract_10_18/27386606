We performed a detailed whole-genome sequence analysis of Providencia rettgeri H1736, a multidrug-resistant clinical pathogen isolated in Israel in 2011. The objective was to describe the genomic flexibility of this bacterium that has greatly contributed to its pathogenicity. The genome has a chromosome size of 4,609,352 bp with 40.22% GC content. Five plasmids were predicted, as well as other mobile genetic elements (MGEs) including phages, genomic islands, and integrative and conjugative elements. The resistome consisted of a total of 27 different antibiotic resistance genes including blaNDM-1, mostly located on MGEs. Phenotypically, the bacteria displayed resistance to a total of ten different antimicrobial classes. Various features such as metabolic operons (including a novel carbapenem biosynthesis operon) and virulence genes were also borne on the MGEs, making P. rettgeri H1736 significantly different from other P. rettgeri isolates. A large quantity of the genetic diversity that exists in P. rettgeri H1736 was due to extensive horizontal gene transfer events, leading to an enormous presence of MGEs in its genome. Most of these changes contributed toward the pathogenic evolution of this bacterium.
