A novel strain of lactic acid bacterium isolated from fermented cucumber was selected due to its high glucansucrase activity. It was identified on the basis of 16S rRNA sequence analysis as Pediococcus pentosaceus CRAG3 (GenBank accession number JX679020). The isolate was round shaped, Gram positive, and catalase negative displaying typical features of lactic acid bacterium. It produced 145 +/- 3.27 mg lactic acid per ml of cell-free supernatant. It showed ability to ferment carbohydrates such as sucrose, dextrose, and arabinose; showed resistance to antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, kanamycin, vancomycin; displayed acid production in triple sugar iron agar test and non-motile nature. Interestingly, the isolate also displayed potential probiotic properties such as hydrophobicity, autoaggregation, coaggregation, and in vitro cell adhesion ability. It exhibited resistance against lysozyme and simulated gastric juice at pH 3.0 with 75 and 58% survival, respectively. It also showed tolerance toward 0.3%, w/v bile salts with 73% survival and ability to deconjugate bile salts. The isolate exhibited antibacterial activity and ability to utilize prebiotics such as inulin and raffinose. These results indicate both probiotic property and glucansucrase-producing ability of P. pentosaceus CRAG3.
