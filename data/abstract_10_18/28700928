Membrane-active antibiotics are potential alternatives to the resistance-prone conventional antibiotics. Daptomycin, a cyclic lipopeptide, is the only membrane-active antibiotic approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration so far. The drug interacts with the cytoplasmic membranes of Gram-positive pathogens, causing membrane permeabilization to ions and cell death. The antibiotic activity is calcium-ion dependent and correlates with the target membrane's content of phosphatidylglycerol (PG). For such a complex reaction with membranes, it has been difficult to uncover the molecular process that underlies its antibacterial activity. The role of the cofactor, calcium ions, has been confusing. Many have proposed that calcium ions binding to daptomycin is a precondition for membrane interaction. Here, we report our findings on the molecular state of daptomycin before and after its membrane-binding reaction, particularly at therapeutic concentrations in the low micromolar range. We were able to perform small-angle x-ray scattering at sufficiently low daptomycin concentrations to determine that the molecules are monomeric before membrane binding. By careful circular dichroism (CD) analyses of daptomycin with Ca(2+) and PG-containing membranes, we found that there are only two states identifiable by CD, one before and another after membrane binding; all other CD spectra are linear combinations of the two. Before membrane binding, the molecular state of daptomycin as defined by CD is the same with or without calcium ions. We are able to determine the stoichiometric ratios of the membrane-binding reaction. The stoichiometric ratio of daptomycin to calcium is 2:3. The stoichiometric ratio of daptomycin to PG is approximately 1:1 if only the PG lipids in the outer leaflets of membranes are accessible to daptomycin.
