The present study was done to scrutinize the possible relation between infective genes and antimicrobial resistance in Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. Considering the fact that the presence of recognized infective determinants among clinical isolates may promote the emergence of infections and persistence of Enterococci in hospital settings, which can lead to an increase in antimicrobial resistance. 175 E. faecalis and 67 E. faecium isolated from clinical specimens were used. The isolates were identified, and then antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed. The MIC of vancomycin and teicoplanin were determined by broth microdilution method. The presence of infective genes esp, hyl and asa1 was scrutinized using PCR. Of the 280 enterococcal isolates, 175 (62.5%) isolates were identified as E. faecalis, 67 (24%) as E. faecium and 38 (13.5%) as Enterococcus spp. The results of the antibiotic susceptibility testing showed resistance rates of 5% and 73% to vancomycin and teicoplanin in E. faecalis and E. faecium isolates, respectively. The statistical analysis showed that the esp infective gene has significant associations with ciprofloxacin, erythromycin and tetracycline in E. faecium and with chloramphenicol in E. faecalis strains; the hyl with teicoplanin and vancomycin in E. faecium strains; and also asa1 with vancomycin in E. faecium and with ampicillin and chloramphenicol in E. faecalis strains. Regarding the relationships between virulence genes and antibiotic resistance in strains of E. faecalis and E. faecium, detection of infective factors associated with invasive diseases has become a major issue of concern.
