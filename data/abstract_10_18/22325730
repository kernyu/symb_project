Bacteria can develop resistance to antibiotics, but little is known about their ability to increase resistance to chemical disinfectants. This study randomly sampled 3 automated endoscope reprocessors in the United States using aldehydes for endoscope disinfection. Bacterial contamination was found after disinfection in all automated endoscope reprocessors, and some mycobacteria isolates demonstrated significant resistance to glutaraldehyde and ortho-phthaldehyde disinfectants. Bacteria can survive aldehyde-based disinfection and may pose a cross-contamination risk to patients.
