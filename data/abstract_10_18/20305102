This study was undertaken in order to compare the frequency of bacterial agents of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and their antimicrobial resistance in the elderly and younger adults admitted to a teaching hospital in Hamedan, Iran. A total of 150 cases of CAP, including 81 elderly and 69 younger adults, were evaluated. The most frequently identified pathogens in younger adults were Moraxella catarralis (11.5%), Streptococcus pneumonia (10.1%) and Staphylococcus aureus (10.1%); while in the elderly the most frequent were S. pneumonia (12.3%), S. aureus (6.1%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.1%). No significant differences were observed between the frequency and antimicrobial resistance pattern of isolated pathogens in either age group. We concluded that the cause of CAP in the elderly follows the general trend of infection in the younger population. Increased resistance of isolated bacteria to the current antibiotics highlights the need for further investigation of newer antibiotics for the treatment of CAP.
