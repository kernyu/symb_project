Listeria monocytogenes became an increasing pathogen involved more frequently in sporadic severe illnesses and outbreaks of foodborne infections. This study investigates in vitro susceptibility of 26 strains of Listeria monocytogenes isolated from the clinical specimens collected between March 2009 and November 2013, from 24 patients hospitalized in three medical institutions in Bucharest. All isolates were tested by disk diffusion method to 15 antimicrobial agents, by using disk diffusion tests. Among the 26 clinical L. monocytogenes isolates tested, no multidrug resistant strains were detected, but 18 (72%) were found to be resistant to at least one clinically relevant antibiotic. Among them, 18 clinical isolates were resistant against ciprofloxacin also. Resistance to Ciprofloxacin was particularly noticed to the strains in Romania. Serological and molecular typing by Multiplex PCR method detected two molecular types 1/2 a, 3a and 1/2 b, 3b, as to the more frequent isolated among studied cases. These types of L. monocytogenes could be associated to the higher pathogenic activity of immunodeficient patients.
