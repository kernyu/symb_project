There was a high percentage of macrolide resistance in Mycoplasma pneumoniae clinical isolates in China. The genetic relatedness of macrolide-resistant M. pneunomiae strains was investigated using the multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat assay (MLVA). Among 152 M. pneunomiae isolates, the 137 macrolide-resistant strains were clustered into 15 MLVA types, indicating that the high macrolide resistance rate in M. pneumoniae is a result of the dissemination of the multiple resistant clones.
