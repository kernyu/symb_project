OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of drug resistance in adult AIDS patients receiving antiretroviral treatment(ART)and influencing factors in Dehong prefecture, Yunnan province during 2012-2014. METHODS: For this cohort study, all the AIDS patients aged over 15 and receiving ART in Dehong were screened for HIV drug resistance in 2012, and 3 715 patients who had received ART for more than 6 months were enrolled for 12 months and 24 months follow up. RESULTS: Among the 3 715 patients, 56.6% were males, 72.6% were aged 26-45 years and 76.0% were married. The main treatment regimen was nevirapine(NVP)+ lamivudine(3TC)+ zidovudine(AZT)(38.2%). A total of 3 556 patients(95.7%)received at least one viral load testing during the two years follow-up, among them 253(7.1%)patients had VL>/=1 000 copies/ml, in which 211(83.4%)received drug resistance related gene mutation testing, the results indicated that the drug resistance developed in 52 and 39 patients in 2013 and 2014(1.43 per 100 person years and 0.88 per 100 person years)respectively. The overall HIV drug incidence was 1.13 per 100 person years. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that age </=25 years, to be infected through drug use, treatment regimen as D4T+ 3TC +NVP and baseline CD4(+) T cells </=200 cells/mul were the risk factor of HIV drug resistance. Eleven HIV gene subtypes were detected in the 82 patients with newly developed drug resistance, CRF_BC was predominant(31.7%), followed by CRF01_AE(22.0%)and C(19.5%). Ten patients were infected with mixed subtypes of CRF_BC/B', CRF_BC/CRF_01B and CRF_BC/C. Most of the 82 patients were resistant to NRTIs and NNRTIs, the main mutation loci were M184V and K103N. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of drug resistance in adult AIDS patients receiving ART was relatively low in Dehong. However, it is necessary to conduct the health education in young people and drug users to improve the treatment compliance and strengthen the surveillance for HIV drug resistance.
