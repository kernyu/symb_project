OBJECTIVES: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a major nosocomial pathogen that causes a variety of infections. MRSA has evolved resistance to multiple antibiotics. Genetic background and virulence differs in different geographic regions. The present study was aimed to investigate the prevalence of enterotoxin genes and spa genotypes of hospital-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (HA-MRSA) isolated from a tertiary care hospital of Jiangsu province, China. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HA-MRSA isolates from August 2013 to April 2014 at a tertiary care hospital of China were collected. We investigated antimicrobial pattern, spa types, SCCmec types and the presence of 14 virulence genes. RESULTS: Eighty HA-MRSA isolates were collected. Results from SCCmec typing revealed that 73.8% were type II; 13.8% were type III; 12.5% were type V. There were 19 different spa types. Spa type t2460 was the most common (35.0%), followed by t002 (11.3%). CC5 was the predominant MLST CCs type (50%). The most frequent toxin genes were sea, seb, sed, sel, sen and seo (100.0%). None of the investigated isolates carried the sec or tst. CONCLUSION: Genotypic and virulence evaluation of the isolated HA-MRSA revealed that the isolates with CC5 and SCCmec II were the predominant type and highly homological. The virulence profiles mainly existed in the genes of sea, seb, sed, sel, sen, seo and ser. The prevalence of t2460 was an outbreak and the predominant spa type.
