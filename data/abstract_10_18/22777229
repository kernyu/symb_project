BACKGROUND: Patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) are known to have a predisposition to colonization or infection by microbial organisms, including both Staphylococcus aureus and herpes simplex virus (HSV). S aureus infection leads to exacerbation of eczema and may induce flares in atopic skin by mediating inflammation. Retapamulin 1% ointment is a unique topical antibiotic formulation that may be a suitable option for the treatment of clinically infected AD. STUDY DESIGN: A single-center, open-label pilot study was conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of retapamulin 1% (Altabax, Stiefel/ GlaxoSmithKline) ointment for the treatment of secondarily infected atopic dermatitis in subjects aged 9 months to 98 years old (n=29). RESULTS: Twice-daily application of retapamulin 1% produced a mean 8.1-point reduction from baseline in the mean Skin Infection Rating Scale score. The majority of subjects achieved clinical cure with topical retapamulin therapy. Retapamulin 1% ointment was effective against S aureus isolates, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Treatment was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Retapamulin 1% is effective for the treatment of atopic dermatitis infected with S aureus, and demonstrates efficacy against both methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant strains. Given its efficacy and good tolerability in this pilot study, retapamulin 1% ointment should be further evaluated as a treatment for infected atopic dermatitis. It may provide convenience and efficacy with a low risk for development of bacterial resistance.
