As an infectious, contagious pathogen, Salmonella is probably rivaled by only bovine viral diarrhea virus in its ability to cause clinical disease, such as enteritis, septicemia, pneumonia, and reproductive losses. The increasing prevalence of Salmonella, particularly Salmonella Dublin, on dairies presents new challenges to producers and veterinarians. No current discussion of bovine salmonellosis is complete without acknowledging the increasing public health concern. Increasing antimicrobial resistance among enteric pathogens brings the use of antimicrobials by veterinarians and producers under ever stricter scrutiny. This article provides a comprehensive review of Salmonella etiology, prevalence, pathogenesis, diagnostics, treatment, and control.
