In order to assess the frequency of clinically relevant linezolid-resistant staphylococcal isolates, and the role of linezolid in maintaining and coselecting multiple resistance mechanisms (cfr, 23S rRNA, L3/L4 mutations), a prospective Italian study was performed from 2010 to 2011 to confirm the diffusion of three major multidrug-resistant clones (ST2, ST5, ST23).
