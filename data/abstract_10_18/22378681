OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of dual-antiretroviral therapy containing a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI/r) in treatment-experienced patients failing a current antiretroviral regimen. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 60 consecutive HIV-1-infected patients who started a dual-antiretroviral rescue regimen containing a PI/r, in three hospitals in Spain. Virological failure was defined as confirmed HIV RNA >50 copies/mL at treatment week 24 or later. The percentage of patients remaining free of therapeutic failure was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, by intent-to-treat analysis (missing, changes and virological failure = therapeutic failure). RESULTS: Median baseline characteristics of patients were: 13 years on antiretroviral therapy (four prior highly active antiretroviral therapy regimens and eight different drugs), 380 CD4 cells/mm(3) and HIV RNA 3.04 log(10) copies/mL. All patients had resistance mutations to at least two drug classes, although only 9.3% had specific mutations to darunavir. A darunavir-based regimen was started in 47 (78.4%) patients, combined with etravirine (26.7%), tenofovir (26.7%) or raltegravir (25%). Three (5%) patients discontinued treatment due to side effects. At the end of follow-up, 86.7% of patients remained free of therapeutic failure; the percentages of patients with no therapeutic failure at treatment weeks 24, 48 and 96 were 96.6% (95% CI, 91.9-101.3); 90.1% (95% CI, 81.9-98.3) and 79.8% (95% CI, 66.1-93.5), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that a dual-therapy rescue regimen including a PI/r is convenient, well tolerated and potent enough to achieve persistent viral suppression in selected pre-treated patients with low viral load and few PI resistance mutations.
