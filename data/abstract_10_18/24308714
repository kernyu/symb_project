The emergence of carbapenemases-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, resistant to all antibiotics except colistin, is an important health problem due to the lack of effective antibiotic treatments. This article assesses the findings of a recently published investigation performed in Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia, where a longitudinal epidemiological and clinical study of extensively drug-resistant P. aeruginosa was performed. This study highlights the progressive increase of VIM-2-positive ST235 P. aeruginosa via clonal dissemination. Strategies to prevent this emergency problem and a global surveillance system are needed in order to minimize this worldwide problem.
