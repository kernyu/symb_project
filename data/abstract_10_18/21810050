The 49th Annual Spring Meeting of the British Society of Parasitology was held at Nottingham University, UK, on 11-14 April 2011. Although a meeting of a national parasitological society, the meeting attracted approximately 375 delegates from 30 countries worldwide. Of the various themes at this meeting, two were focused on the biology, etiology and development of therapeutics for the parasitic diseases; malaria and schistosomiasis. Here we report on three aspects of this meeting that are focused on the development of novel therapeutics to address the significant health burden imposed by these tropical diseases.
