Complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs) are common yet serious infections that can potentially lead to substantial morbidity and morbidity. As an essential adjunct to source control, the goals of antimicrobial therapy are to promote patient recovery, reduce recurrence risk, and prevent antimicrobial resistance. The current international guidelines on the empirical treatment of community-acquired complicated IAIs were published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Surgical Infections Society (SIS) in 2010. These guidelines all recommend the use of a fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin) plus metronidazole for mild-to-moderate- and high-severity cases. Moxifloxacin monotherapy is recommended by the current IDSA/SIS guidelines for the treatment of mild-to-moderate complicated IAIs. Moxifloxacin has demonstrated a broad spectrum coverage of both aerobic and anaerobic pathogens, good tissue penetration into the gastrointestinal tract, and a good tolerability profile. Clinical data have demonstrated that moxifloxacin is at least as effective as other standard therapeutic regimens recommended by current clinical guidelines. Due to the high rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae and fluoroquinolone-resistant Enterobacteriaceae among isolates causing community-acquired IAIs in Asia, any fluoroquinolones (including moxifloxacin) are not recommended as drugs of choice for the empirical treatment of community-acquired IAIs, particularly in countries (China, India, Thailand, and Vietnam) with fluoroquinolone resistance rates among Escherichia coli isolates of >20%. Given the low rates of fluoroquinolone-resistant (<20%) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing (<10%) Enterobacteriaceae isolates associated community-acquired IAIs in Taiwan, it appears that moxifloxacin is considered an appropriate first-line therapy for patients with community-acquired complicated IAIs in this country.
