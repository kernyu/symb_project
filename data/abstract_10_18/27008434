Urinary tract infections are among the most common bacterial infectious diseases worldwide. Every second woman will experience at least one urinary tract infection in her lifetime. The administration of antibiotics has been a safe and efficient treatment modality so far. However, due to the emergence of multi-resistant pathogens and the developmental void of new antimicrobial drugs, the therapy of infections mighty become more challenging in the near future. So, knowledge of the complex host-pathogen interaction is of great importance. Common phenotypes observed in clinical practice suggest basic principles, which are relevant for the development of novel antimicrobial strategies. With invading pathogens forming intracellular bacterial communities they evade host response and provide a nidus for recurrent infection. A plethora of virulence factors allow uropathogenic bacteria to colonize and to establish infections in the urinary tract. In response, host responses seem to address specific virulence mechanisms that are essential to pathogenicity. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying the complex host-pathogen interaction is critical to devise novel treatment options.
