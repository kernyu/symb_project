The new global strategy to achieve long-term malaria eradication is based on rapid treatment of individual malaria patients and blocking the spread of Plasmodium parasites in the population. In a number of countries increased funding combined with more effective control measures have resulted in a substantial decline in the incidence of malaria and in the resulting morbidity and mortality. Increasing resistance of Anopheles mosquitoes to insecticides (pyrethroids and DDT), and reduced sensitivity of Plasmodium parasites to various antimalarials increase the need for the development of new vector control strategies and medicines. Vaccine development efforts have been speeding up and a first vaccine is expected within three years.
