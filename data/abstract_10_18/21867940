This article introduces one of the most diverse classes of direct-acting antivirals for hepatitis C, the nucleoside and non-nucleoside NS5B polymerase inhibitors. Through a systematic review of the published literature, we describe their structure, mechanism of action, issues with resistance, and clinical effectiveness shown in the latest clinical trials. Direct-acting antiviral combination trials that have already shown some early promising results even in the setting of interferon-sparing antiviral regimens are discussed.
