Currently, praziquantel is the only drug of choice for treatment of schistosomiasis. Reports of praziquantel resistance raise concerns about future control of the disease. Therefore, the search for new schistosomicidal drugs is eminent. In this study, the effect of a novel benzimidazole-derived compound (compound BTP-Iso) was assessed in mice harboring adult Schistosoma mansoni (Egyptian strain). Mice were treated 42 days p.i. with compound BTP-Iso using two treatment regimens (200 or 300 mg/kg). In both regimens, there were significant reductions in the number of recovered S. mansoni worms especially females and in immature ova, in addition to a significant reduction in the number and size of hepatic granulomata. A dose of 300 mg/kg resulted in a significant decrease in intestinal and hepatic tissue egg loads. Effect on schistosomes was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy, where adult worms recovered from mice treated with 200 mg/kg of compound BTP-Iso revealed tegumental alternations, characterised by swelling of tegumental ridges, bleb formation, and mild erosion in male worms; however in females, there were extensive erosion and destruction of the tegumental surface. These promising results may encourage future use of compound BTP-Iso in the treatment of schistosomiasis. However, more research is needed to detect the effect of compound BTP-Iso on early developmental stages of S. mansoni and on other species of human schistosomes.
