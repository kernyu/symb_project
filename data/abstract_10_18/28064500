The resistance developed by life-threatening bacteria toward conventional antibiotics has become a major concern in public health. To combat antibiotic resistance, there has been a significant interest in the development of antimicrobial cationic polymers due to the ease of synthesis and low manufacturing cost compared to host-defense peptides (HDPs). Herein, we report the design and synthesis of amphiphilic polycarbonates containing primary amino groups. These polymers exhibit potent antimicrobial activity and excellent selectivity to Gram-positive bacteria, including multidrug resistant pathogens. Fluorescence and TEM studies suggest that these polymers are likely to kill bacteria by disrupting bacterial membranes. These polymers also show low tendency to elicit resistance in bacteria. Their further development may lead to new antimicrobial agents combating drug-resistance.
