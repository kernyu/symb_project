Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major health problem worldwide, and the development of effective vaccines is urgently needed. Vaccination strategies based on heterologous prime-boost protocols using Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) as primer and modified vaccinia virus Ankara strain expressing the mycobacterial antigen Ag85A (MVA85A) as booster may increase the protective efficacy of BCG. In addition, vaccination with the recombinant viral vaccine vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-846 (Rv3615c, Mtb10.4, and Rv2660c) can elicit a remarkable T-cell-mediated immune response and provide an effective long-term protection after the BCG challenge. In this study, we used VSV-846 to boost BCG and evaluated its immunogenicity in BALB/c mice. In this prime-boost approach, boosting with VSV-846 significantly enhanced IFN-gamma CD4 T cell responses, which are crucial for anti-TB immune responses. Moreover, VSV-846 boosting significantly reduced pathology compared with mock vaccination, and decreased the bacterial loads in lung tissues compared with BCG or VSV-846 vaccination alone. The analysis of vaccine-induced immunity identified that polyfunctional T cells might contribute to the enhanced protection by VSV-846 boosting. This study proved that viral booster VSV-846 in mice improved the protection against mycobacteria infection, which could be helpful in designing an efficient vaccination strategy against TB in humans.
