Tuberculosis continues to be a global threat. Efforts to eradicate this disease are hampered by the long course and potential toxicity of currently available treatment regimens, the increasing prevalence of tuberculosis-HIV coinfection, the evolution of drug resistant organisms, and the lack of a highly effective vaccine. Recent studies have suggested methods to improve the cost effectiveness of existing treatment strategies. Decreasing the relapse rate among high-risk individuals by extending therapy can be balanced by the cost savings of self-administered therapy for low-risk individuals. For the first time in over 30 years, new medications are flowing through the drug discovery pipeline. New agents with activity against slowly dividing bacilli have the potential to shorten the duration of therapy. Many have a more favorable side-effect profile than currently available medications. And even extensively drug-resistant organisms will be susceptible to these secret weapons. The fully sequenced genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been exploited to develop safer and more effective candidate vaccines. Highly immunogenic mycobacterial fragments, revved-up versions of the existing vaccine, and toned-down versions of M. tuberculosis are all in various phases of clinical testing. This expanded arsenal has the potential to deliver a fatal blow to one of humanity's greatest enemies.
