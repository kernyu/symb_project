BACKGROUND: Gram-positive bacteria are the major causative pathogens of peritonitis and exit site infection in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). We investigated the cost-effectiveness of regular application of mupirocin at the exit site in PD recipients from the perspective of health care providers in Hong Kong. METHODS: A decision tree was designed to simulate outcomes of incident PD patients with and without regular application of mupirocin over a 1-year period. Outcome measures included total direct medical costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, and gram-positive infection-related mortality rate. Model inputs were derived from the literature. Sensitivity analyses evaluated the impact of uncertainty in all model variables. RESULTS: In a base case analysis, the mupirocin group had a higher expected QALY value (0.6496 vs 0.6456), a lower infection-related mortality rate (0.18% vs 1.64%), and a lower total cost per patient (US $258 vs $1661) compared with the control group. The rate of gram-positive peritonitis without mupirocin and the risk of gram-positive peritonitis with mupirocin were influential factors. In 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations, the mupirocin group had significantly lower associated costs, higher QALYs, and a lower mortality rate 99.9% of the time. CONCLUSIONS: Topical mupirocin appears to be a cost-effective preventive measure against gram-positive infection in incident patients undergoing PD. The cost-effectiveness of mupirocin is affected by the level of infection risk reduction and subject to resistance against mupirocin.
