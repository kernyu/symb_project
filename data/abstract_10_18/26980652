OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) on biomodification of demineralized dentine substrate, in its permeability, hydrophobicity, and inhibition ability to collagen enzymatic degradation. METHODS: The dentine substrates were treated with simulated pulpal pressure created by mixtures of 0.02%, 0.1% EGCG/bovine serum albumin (BSA) in acidic environment (pH4.4) for 48 h. A fluid-transport model was used to measure the fluid permeability through demineralized dentine substrate. Positive replicas of dentine substrate were fabricated before and after being subjected to acidic environment for scanning electron microscope (SEM) examination. The blank group contained no EGCG and the positive group were treated with Gluma desensitizer. Static contact angle measurements on demineralized dentin and 0.1% EGCG primed dentin were performed by contact angle analyzer. The priming time were 60 s, 120 s, 0.5 h, 1 h. Dentine specimens bonded with Adper single bond 2 were subjected to 100 mg/L collagenase and observed under SEM. Resin-bonded specimens (with 0.02%, 0.1%, 0.5% EGCG priming, or without EGCG priming) were created for micro-tensile bond strength evaluation (MTBS). Resin-bonded specimens after thermol cycling were created for MTBS evaluation. RESULTS: The fluid permeability in the blank control group increased ([151.3+/-22.3]%), the fluid permeability in 0.1% EGCG/BSA group decreased ([23.7+/-6.3]%). Compared to the blank control group, the contact angle of 120 s, 0.5 h, 1 h groups increased by 31.0%, 53.5%, 57.8% in deep dentin and 37.4%, 59.3%, 62.4% in shallow dentin. The SEM examination showed that 0.1% and 0.5% EGCG priming for 120 s significantly increased dentin collagen's resistance to collagenase. The immediate MTBS of 0.1% and 0.5% EGCG groups were (29.4+/-4.8) and (19.8+/- 4.9) MPa. After thermol cycling, the MTBS of 0.1% and 0.5% EGCG groups were (19.9+/-5.1) and (15.3+/- 6.3) MPa. CONCLUSIONS: Under acidic environment (pH4.4), the 0.1% EGCG can reduce dentine permeability under acidic environment. The 0.1% EGCG can increase hydrophobicity of dentin substrate, and strengthen dentin substrate's resistance to collagenase hydrolysis, thus increased the resin-dentin bonding durability.
