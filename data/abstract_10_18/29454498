AIMS: To investigate the prevalence of EBF at 3-months postpartum, and the early factors for discontinuation. DESIGN: Observational, retrospective study. LOCATION: Health department of La Ribera, Valencia, Spain. PARTICIPANTS: Newborns between December 2012 to January 2017. METHODS: Pregnant women were interviewed at postpartum and at 3 months regarding variables associated with breastfeeding initiation and continuation, matched with socio-demographic and obstetric-neonatal information. MAIN MEASUREMENTS: Prevalence of breastfeeding at discharge and exclusive breastfeeding at 3 months. Reasons for interrupt exclusive breastfeeding. Chi-square determination between qualitative variables. FINDINGS: One thousand three hundred and thirty-eighth women were recruited. EBF at discharge was 68.2% (913) and at 3 months 46.7% (625). EBF duration was 68.7+/-32.7 days (95% CI: 66.9-71.2). We found statistically significant differences between the type of breastfeeding and the variables, year of study, country of origin and parity (P<0.001, P=0.005 and P=0.05 respectively). Hypogalactia (21.8%) and lower than recommended increase in newborn weight gain (14.9%) were most frequent factors for discontinuation. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of EBF at 3 months is low compared to other similar studies, although we see an upward trend. Belief in hypogalactia influenced the maintenance of exclusive breastfeeding.
