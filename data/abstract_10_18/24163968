This study determined the levels of tetracycline and heavy metals (lead and cadmium) levels in frozen chicken. One hundred frozen chicken muscle samples were sourced from major markets in Lagos and Ibadan (fifty samples each). The samples were analyzed using high power liquid chromatography (HPLC) for tetracycline residue determination while atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) was used to determine the levels of lead and cadmium residues in the samples. Mean concentrations of tetracycline residue levels in the frozen chicken sampled ranged from 1.1589-1.0463ppm which is higher than the maximum residue limit set by international food safety agencies. Pb contents were higher in chicken muscles sampled from markets in Ibadan (0.0227 +/- 0.0069 microg dL(-2)) than Lagos (0.0207 +/- 0.0082 microg dL(-1)), while Cd levels were 0.0013 microg dL(-1) higher than in the Lagos samples (0.0065 +/- 0.0026 microg dL(-1)). These values were within maximum residue limits. There were no significant differences (p < 0.05) in levels of tetracycline, lead and cadmium levels from the two market locations (Lagos and Ibadan) and parts (wings and thigh muscles). However, significant differences occurred in tetracycline and Pb levels in frozen chicken sourced from Cotonou. Though not significant, tetracycline contents in the thigh muscles of the frozen chicken samples was higher than that of the wings muscles and this was attributed to the site of administration of antibiotic injection and failure to observe the pre-slaughter withdrawal period by the farmers. This study is of public health importance as the presence of these residues above the maximum residue limit in frozen chicken predisposes consumers to drug resistance, allergic reactions and poisoning as a result of toxicity.
