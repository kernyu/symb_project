Bacterial infections are increasingly difficult to combat as bacteria evolve resistance to antibiotic drugs and have severely compromised the arsenal of antibiotic drugs. On the other hand matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a fundamental role in inflammation and extracellular matrix degradation in physiological and pathological conditions. In search of potent antibiotic, taking coumarin and dihydropyrimidinone as lead compound, a green, eco-friendly and efficient protocol has been developed and synthesized the dihydropyrimidin-2(1H)-one/thione derivatives of coumarin 3/4 from substituted 4-formylcoumarins 2 and ethylacetoacetate using urea/thiourea in the presence of catalytic amount of ceric ammonium nitrate is reported. All the synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antibacterial activity against four bacterial strains by broth dilution method. The tested compounds have exhibited promising in vitro potency with low MIC values against the drug susceptive S. aureus strain with low MIC values ranging from 0.2 to 6.25mug/mL. The in vivo anti-inflammatory potency of 3a-e and 4a-e by gelatin zymography is comparable to that of tetracycline. Molecular docking study performed for all the synthesized compounds with S. aureus DNA gyrase and results obtained were quite promising.
