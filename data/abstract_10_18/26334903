INTRODUCTION: Basidiobolomycosis is an unusual fungal disease that rarely involves the visceral organs such as gastrointestinal tract. Gastrointestinal basidiobolomycosis (GIB) has been increasingly reported in the literature, and it is an emerging disease from arid regions worldwide, in particular, the south-western Saudi Arabia. We report a case of GIB in a 36-year-old Saudi Arabian male patient showing resistance to itraconazole and best treated with voriconazole. Computed tomography showed diffusely thickened small bowel with edematous change. CONCLUSIONS: As GIB presents diagnostic challenges due to lack of specific features, this case emphasizes the importance of considering GIB in the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with fever, abdominal pain with fast-growing abdominal mass.
