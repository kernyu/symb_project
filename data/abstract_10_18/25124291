OBJECTIVES: Emtricitabine/tenofovir/rilpivirine as a single-tablet regimen (STR) is widely used without licence in treatment-experienced patients. The purpose of this retrospective observational study was to assess viral suppression of ART-experienced patients switching to STR. METHODS: We assessed 131 pretreated patients switching to STR with HIV RNA <400 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients at week 24 with HIV RNA <40 copies/mL. RESULTS: By week 24, eight patients had stopped STR: four because of adverse events and four for other reasons. Three virological failures were observed; among these, at least one patient developed cross-resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), in particular with the E138K pattern. In intent-to-treat analysis, 92% of participants (120 of 131) achieved HIV RNA <40 copies/mL. Only grade 1 to 2 adverse events were observed, mainly consisting of increased liver enzymes (n=33). Systemic exposure to rilpivirine was above the usually observed steady-state levels for the 18 measurements assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Efficacy and tolerability are similar to those in treatment-naive patients.
