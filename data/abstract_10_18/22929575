Reduction of antimicrobial resistance in microorganisms is imperative. Pneumonia is important in this matter because of its high incidence, subjective diagnostic criteria, and variations in aetiology. Research has focused on the use of a procalcitonin-guided algorithm for antimicrobial stewardship with promising reductions in antibiotic use and treatment duration, but more research is needed in order to draw a final conclusion. Lack of objective diagnostic criteria, methodological challenges in research, a future focus on primary care, and the need for a cost-benefit analysis should be considered.
