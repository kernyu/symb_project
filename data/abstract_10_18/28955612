In recent years, bioactive compounds are in high demand in the pharmaceuticals and naturopathy, due to their health benefits to human and plants. Microorganisms synthesize these compounds and some enzymes either alone or in association with plants. Microbes residing inside the plant tissues, known as endophytes, also produce an array of these compounds. Endophytic actinomycetes act as a promising resource of biotechnologically valuable bioactive compounds and secondary metabolites. Endophytic Streptomyces sp. produced some novel antibiotics which are effective against multi-drug-resistant bacteria Antimicrobial agents produced by endophytes are eco-friendly, toxic to pathogens and do not harm the human. Endophytic inoculation of the plants modulates the synthesis of bioactive compounds with high pharmaceutical properties besides promoting growth of the plants. Hydrolases, the extracellular enzymes, produced by endophytic bacteria, help the plants to establish systemic resistance against pathogens invasion. Phytohormones produced by endophytes play an essential role in plant development and drought resistance management. The high diversity of endophytes and their adaptation to various environmental stresses seem to be an untapped source of new secondary metabolites. The present review summarizes the role of endophytic bacteria in synthesis and modulation of bioactive compounds.
