Many pathogenic microorganisms have the ability to form biofilms that are impervious to conventional antibiotics making these pathogens resistant to multiple antibiotics. This necessitates the development of novel antimicrobial compounds with less chance of resistance development and the ability to penetrate the extracellular polymer matrix of bacterial biofilms. In this report, simple assays to test the antibiofilm potential of antimicrobial peptides are described.
