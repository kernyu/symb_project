The objective of this study was to characterize the antimicrobial resistance patterns of 100 clinical isolates of Enterobacter spp. with special regard to the occurrence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance by qnr-determinants. The rate of ESBL- and qnr-positive isolates was 7% and 14%, respectively. Thirteen isolates harbored a qnrA1, and a further isolate harbored a qnrB4 gene. Moreover, qnr-determinants were significantly associated with ESBL-expression. No carbapeneme or tigecycline resistance was detected in the collective tested. To conclude, these data confirm the increase of multiple antimicrobial resistance mechanisms in Enterobacter spp.
