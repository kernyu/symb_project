BACKGROUND: Severe burns often initiate the prevalence of hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, significantly contributing to adverse clinical outcomes. However, there are limited treatment options. This study was designed to investigate the role and the underlying mechanisms of oral antibiotics to selectively decontaminate the digestive tract (SDD) on burn-induced insulin resistance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were subjected to 40% of total body surface area full-thickness burn or sham operation with or without SDD treatment. Translocation of FITC-labeled LPS was measured at 4h after burn. Furthermore, the effect of SDD on post-burn quantity of gram-negative bacteria in gut was investigated. Serum or muscle LPS and proinflammatory cytokines were measured. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and insulin tolerance test were used to determine the status of systemic insulin resistance. Furthermore, intracellular insulin signaling (IRS-1 and Akt) and proinflammatory related kinases (JNK and IKKbeta) were assessed by western blot. RESULTS: Burn increased the translocation of LPS from gut 4h after injury. SDD treatment effectively inhibited post-burn overgrowth of gram-negative enteric bacilli in gut. In addition, severe burns caused significant increases in the LPS and proinflammatory cytokines levels, activation of proinflammatory related kinases, and systemic insulin resistance as well. But SDD treatment could significantly attenuate burn-induced insulin resistance and improve the whole-body responsiveness to insulin, which was associated with the inhibition of gut-derived LPS, cytokines, proinflammatory related kinases JNK and IKKbeta, as well as activation of IRS-1 and Akt. CONCLUSIONS: SDD appeared to have an effect on proinflammatory signaling cascades and further reduced severe burn-induced insulin resistance.
