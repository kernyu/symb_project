Complement deficiencies have been identified in many chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. Supplying fresh frozen plasma (FFP)-derived complement can enhance complement-dependent cell lysis by the rituximab. The objective of our study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of the treatment by adding FFP to rituximab in fludarabine refractory CLL patients. Twenty-two patients were treated with two units of FFP followed with rituximab, 375 mg/m(2), as a single agent, repeated every 1-2 weeks. Patients received a median of four courses of the combined FFP and rituximab treatment (range: 2-6). Sixteen patients (72.7%) responded to treatment and seven (31.8%) achieved a complete remission. Three (13.6%) of which had no evidence of minimal residual disease after treatment. Patients with high expression of ZAP-70 or CD38, unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region, mutated p53, or adverse cytogenetic features, achieved response to treatment at rates that appeared similar to those who did not have such characteristics. With a median follow-up of 12 (4-19) months, the median overall survival and progression free survival have not been achieved. Toxicity was minimal, and the treatment was well tolerated. Our data suggest that the adding FFP to rituximab is an effective nonmyelotoxic regimen for the treatment of fludarabine refractory CLL patients.
