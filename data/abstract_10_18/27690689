INTRODUCTION: With resistance of S. aureus, the most prevalent identified pathogen in skin and soft tissue infections, on the rise, the need for safe, effective, and well-tolerated antibiotics is crucial. Ceftobiprole medocaril (BAL-5788), ceftobiprole's parenteral prodrug, is a bactericidal cephalosporin with broad Gram-positive and Gram-negative activity that has shown to be well-tolerated and noninferior to vancomycin and vancomycin plus ceftazidime in the treatment of MRSA complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSIs) in clinical trials. Areas Covered: This article overviews ceftobiprole medocaril's use for cSSSI, with specific focus on clinical efficacy and safety data in addition to summary information on its basic chemistry, microbiological profile, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships supporting its use in cSSSIs. Information sources include peer-reviewed scientific literature, conference proceedings, publically available regulatory reports, as well as information from the drug sponsor's website. Expert Commentary: With increasing antibiotic resistance, safe, effective antibiotics agents are a welcome sight. There has been clinical evidence in support of using ceftobiprole for treatment of Gram-positive and -negative infections, including MRSA and susceptible P. aeruginosa. This broad antimicrobial activity might allow ceftobiprole to be an alternative to dual therapy combinations when potential drug toxicities, drug-drug or drug-disease interactions are concerns for other agents.
