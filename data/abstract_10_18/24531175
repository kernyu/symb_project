We describe an outbreak of a carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae sequence type 258 (ST258) clone in an Italian hospital during two months in 2010. The rapid detection and management of the eleven patients colonized and infected with KPC-producing K.pneumoniae curbed the spread of this multidrug-resistant organism.
