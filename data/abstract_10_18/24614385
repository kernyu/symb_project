Previously, through a proteomic analysis, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was found to be overexpressed in the sodium antimony gluconate (SAG)-resistant clinical isolate compared to that in the SAG-sensitive clinical isolate of Leishmania donovani. The present study was designed to explore the potential role of the PCNA protein in SAG resistance in L. donovani. For this purpose, the protein was cloned, overexpressed, purified, and modeled. Western blot (WB) and real-time PCR (RT-PCR) analyses confirmed that PCNA was overexpressed by >/= 3-fold in the log phase, stationary phase, and peanut agglutinin isolated procyclic and metacyclic stages of the promastigote form and by ~5-fold in the amastigote form of the SAG-resistant isolate compared to that in the SAG-sensitive isolate. L. donovani PCNA (LdPCNA) was overexpressed as a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein in a SAG-sensitive clinical isolate of L. donovani, and modulation of the sensitivities of the transfectants to pentavalent antimonial (Sb(V)) and trivalent antimonial (Sb(III)) drugs was assessed in vitro against promastigotes and intracellular (J774A.1 cell line) amastigotes, respectively. Overexpression of LdPCNA in the SAG-sensitive isolate resulted in an increase in the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of Sb(V) (from 41.2 +/- 0.6 mug/ml to 66.5 +/- 3.9 mug/ml) and Sb(III) (from 24.0 +/- 0.3 mug/ml to 43.4 +/- 1.8 mug/ml). Moreover, PCNA-overexpressing promastigote transfectants exhibited less DNA fragmentation compared to that of wild-type SAG-sensitive parasites upon Sb(III) treatment. In addition, SAG-induced nitric oxide (NO) production was found to be significantly inhibited in the macrophages infected with the transfectants compared with that in wild-type SAG-sensitive parasites. Consequently, we infer that LdPCNA has a significant role in SAG resistance in L. donovani clinical isolates, which warrants detailed investigations regarding its mechanism.
