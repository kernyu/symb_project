PURPOSE: Strains of Acinetobacter spp. are responsible for a considerable percentage of hospital infections. These pathogens have colonized hospital environment and developed resistance to many currently available antibiotics. The aim of this study was one year-long analysis of the occurrence of multiresistant strains of Acinetobacter spp. in population of patients hospitalized in ICU of ED and determination of their genetic similarity. MATERIAL/METHODS: Subject of research was the population of patients admitted to ED of University Hospital in Bialystok in the period from 01.08.2010 to 01.08.2011. In the analysed group of patients, infections were identified on the basis of the guidelines of CDC. Identification and drug susceptibility of strains was specified using the automatic methods with the analyzer Vitek 2XL. Genotyping using Rep-PCR method in DiversiLab system was performed on strains of Acinetobacter spp. to determinate their genetic similarity. RESULTS: During analyzed period 405 patients were hospitalized, from 14 of them multiresistant strains of Acinetobacter spp. were isolated. Conducted genetic research allowed to detect 5 clones. Rep-PCR method in DiversiLab system enabled to learn that different clone of multiresistant strain of Acinetobacter spp. is responsible for variable forms of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Results of conducted research suggest that genotyping with rep-PCR method in DiversiLab system is useful tool in diagnostics of clones of multiresistant pathogens isolated from patients requiring intensive care, hospitalized in ED. Genotyping with rep-PCR method combined with epidemiological investigation enables to establish ways of spreading of multiresistant strains of Acinetobacter spp. in ED.
