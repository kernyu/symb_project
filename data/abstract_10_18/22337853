Novel influenza A (H1N1) has created a major worldwide health problem within a short time after its emergence. This infection is often self-limited, but sometimes can cause severe and fatal complications. In this study, we present two rare complications of pandemic influenza A, who were referred to Razi University Affiliated Hospital in northern Iran. The first case was a 30-year-old man with severe headache and high fever accompanied with chills, generalized myalgia, and arthralgia. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was consistent with aseptic meningitis. The second case, a 25-year-old pregnant woman with high fever, chills and severe fatigue and malaise, developed tachypnea, tachycardia, respiratory distress, cyanosis and loss of consciousness a few hours after admission. Echocardiography reported myopericarditis. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and mechanical ventilation was begun. The next day, the patient started vaginal bleeding which progressed to spontaneous abortion three days later. Diagnosis of novel influenza A (H1N1) was confirmed using real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR of a pharyngeal swab.
