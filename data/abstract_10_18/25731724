Environmental contamination by toxic organic compounds and antimicrobials is one of the causes for the recent surge of multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacteria. Monitoring contamination is therefore the first step in containment of antimicrobial resistance and requires the development of simple, sensitive, and quantitative tools that detect a broad spectrum of toxic compounds. In this study, we have engineered a new microbial biosensor based on the ttgR-regulated promoter that controls expression of the TtgABC extrusion efflux pump of Pseudomonas putida, coupled to a gfp reporter. The system was introduced in P. putida DOT-T1E, a strain characterized by its ability to survive in the presence of high concentrations of diverse toxic organic compounds. This whole-cell biosensor is capable to detect a wide range of structurally diverse antibiotics, as well as compounds such as toluene or flavonoids.
