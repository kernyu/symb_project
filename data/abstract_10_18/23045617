BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis elicits cross-regulatory immune responses, but it is unclear how antihelminthic treatment affects this balance. This study integrates data on 13 cytokines elicited by 3 schistosome to examine how praziquantel treatment alters immune polarization and whether post-treatment cytokine profiles influence reinfection status. METHODS: Venous blood from 72 Schistosoma haematobium-exposed participants was cultured with schistosome egg, adult worm, and cercaria antigens pre- and 6 weeks post-praziquantel treatment. Innate inflammatory (tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-alpha], interleukin(IL-)-6, IL-8), Th1 (interferon gamma [IFN-gamma], IL-2, IL-12p70), Th2 (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13), Th17 (IL-17A, IL-21, IL-23p19), and regulatory (IL-10) cytokines were quantified via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cytokine data was integrated using nonmetric multidimensional scaling and factor analysis. RESULTS: Egg-specific cytokine phenotypes became more proinflammatory post-treatment due to increased TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-gamma, IL-12p70, and IL-23 levels. Post-treatment cercariae-specific responses were also more proinflammatory reflecting elevated IL-8. In contrast, post-treatment adult worm-specific responses were less inflammatory, reflecting lower post-treatment IL-6. A combination of egg-induced IL-6, IL-12p70, IL-21, and IL-23 and adult worm-induced IL-5 and IL-21 post-treatment was associated with reduced reinfection risk 18 months later. CONCLUSIONS: Praziquantel treatment markedly alters polarization of schistosome-specific cytokine responses, and these changes, particularly in response to egg-stage parasites, may promote resistance to reinfection.
