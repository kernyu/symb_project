Since its discovery in 1982, Helicobacter pylori has been established as a common cause of gastritis and peptic ulcer disease. H pylori infection is also closely associated with several gastric malignancies and has consequently been designated a human carcinogen. As these associations have become increasingly recognized and pursued, a growing challenge facing today's clinicians is the management of patients with persistent H pylori despite previous attempts to treat the infection. In developed countries, the most popular treatment regimen remains traditional triple therapy consisting of a proton pump inhibitor, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin for 7 to 14 days. Unfortunately, eradication rates with traditional triple therapy are disappointing, with infection persisting in as many as 25% of those treated. This article addresses the management of patients with persistent H pylori infection, including indications for confirmatory testing, reasons for treatment failure, and established and emerging salvage regimens for patients with persistent infection.
