The aim of study was to elucidate the influence of foliar sprays of androsterone in alleviating detrimental effects of chilling stress in maize seedlings. Eleven-days-old maize seedlings were treated with 10(-9) mol L(-1) androsterone and then transferred to a chamber with temperature of 10/7 degrees C (day/night) for 3 days. The stress injury was measured in terms of increase in electrolyte leakage, superoxide production and hydrogen peroxide level, and decrease in chlorophyll content. Androsterone application mitigated significantly the chilling-induced stress injury. Under chilling stress, the oxidative damage which was measured as malondialdehyde content was lesser in androsterone-applied seedlings that were associated with greater activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), guaiacol peroxidase (POX), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and glutathione reductase (GR). Moreover, SOD, POX and APX isozymes exhibited a strong correlation with changes in their activities. Androsterone application enhanced the level of antioxidant compounds like ascorbic acid, glutathione, proline and carotenoid as well as activities of antioxidant enzymes. Similarly, while androsterone treatment increased total antioxidant status, it reduced total oxidant status relative to chilling-stressed seedlings alone. Soluble protein profile was significantly changed by only chilling stress and chilling stress plus androsterone treatment, as well. According to these findings, it is possible to say that androsterone could be used to alleviate the damaging effects of chilling stress by improving antioxidative system in maize seedlings. This is the first study elucidating the effects of androsterone on resistance to chilling stress of plants.
