OBJECTIVES: Resistant minority variants present before ART can be a source of virological failure. This has been shown for NRTIs, NNRTIs and CCR5 inhibitors. However, very few data are available for the detection of such minority resistant variants that could be selected at virological failure and not detected using classical Sanger sequencing. METHODS: We studied 26 patients treated with tenofovir, emtricitabine and efavirenz with their first virological failure (defined as two consecutive viral loads >50 copies/mL). We performed standard Sanger sequencing and ultradeep sequencing (UDS; Roche 454((R)) Life Sciences) in plasma at failure. For UDS, mutations >1% were considered. We compared the presence of reverse transcriptase mutations between the two techniques, using the latest ANRS algorithm. RESULTS: UDS detected more resistance mutations in 38.5% of cases (10/26 patients) and the genotypic sensitivity score (GSS) was reduced for 6 of them (23.1%). The GSS was impacted more often for NRTIs than for NNRTIs, for which most mutations were already detected by Sanger sequencing. Resistant minority variants were detected even in patients with low viral load at failure. CONCLUSIONS: These results strongly argue for the use of next-generation sequencing in patients failing on an NRTI+NNRTI regimen, as UDS has the potential to modify the choice of the subsequent regimen.
