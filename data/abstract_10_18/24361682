We examined CD4 cell count and plasma viral load patterns among Botswana TDF/FTC Oral HIV Prophylaxis Trial (TDF2 study) participants who seroconverted, comparing participants assigned to receive tenofovir/emtricitabine with participants assigned to receive placebo. We also evaluated for antiretroviral drug resistance among the breakthrough HIV infections. Among nine seroconverters assigned to tenofovir/emtricitabine and 24 to placebo, there were no significant differences in their CD4 cell count or viral load profiles over time. Of the four participants who seroconverted on-study while receiving tenofovir/emtricitabine, none became infected as a result of drug-resistant HIV; moreover, no resistance mutations emerged following seroconversion.
