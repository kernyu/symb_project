Two new flavonoids, named cambodianins D (1) and E (2), together with two known flavanes (2S)-7,4'-dihydroxy-6,8-dimethylflavane (3) and (2S)-7,3'-dihydroxy-4'-methoxy-8-methylflavane (4), were isolated from dragon's blood of Dracaena cambodiana. The new compounds were determined by HR-ESI-MS and spectroscopic techniques (UV, IR, 1D, and 2D NMR). Compounds 1-3 exhibited antimicrobial activities.
