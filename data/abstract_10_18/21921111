Diphtheria-like human illness caused by Corynebacterium ulcerans is an emerging threat in developed countries, with incidence sometimes higher than that of diphtheria caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Companion animals are considered a potential source of human infections. In order to determine the prevalence of C. ulcerans among dogs, we performed a screening for the bacterium in 583 dogs in the custody of the Osaka Prefectural government. Forty-four dogs (7.5 %) were positive for the bacterium, although they did not show any clinical symptoms. All bacterial isolates showed resistance or decreased sensitivity to clindamycin, and some showed decreased sensitivity to levofloxacin. Comparative analysis of isolates using PFGE, toxin gene typing and antibiotic sensitivities suggests that transmission between asymptomatic dogs might have occurred.
