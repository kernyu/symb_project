Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is a potentially useful tool for the detection of antimicrobial resistance, especially that conferred by beta-lactamases. Here we describe a modification of a previously reported MALDI-TOF MS meropenem hydrolysis assay. The modified method was validated on 108 carbapenemase-producing members of the Enterobacteriaceae, two NDM-1-producing Acinetobacter baumannii isolates, and 35 carbapenem-resistant enterobacteria producing no carbapenemase. The detection of carbapenemases by MALDI-TOF MS seems to be a powerful, quick, and cost-effective method for microbiological laboratories.
