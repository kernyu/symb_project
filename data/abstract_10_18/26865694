Vancomycin-intermediateStaphylococcus aureus(VISA) and heteroresistant VISA (hVISA) are pathogens for which accurate antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) would rule out standard treatment with vancomycin. Unfortunately, AST for vancomycin is relatively slow and standard methods are unable to reliably detect VISA and hVISA. An article in this issue (C. A. Mather, B. J. Werth, S. Sivagnanam, D. J. SenGupta, and S. M. Butler-Wu, J Clin Microbiol 54:883-890, 2016, doi:http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JCM.02428-15) describes a rapid whole-cell matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight proxy susceptibility method that highlights current innovations and challenges with rapid AST, VISA/hVISA identification, and clinical bioinformatics.
