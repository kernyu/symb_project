The increase in drug resistance and invasion caused by biofilm formation brings enormous challenges to the management of Candida infection. Aspirin's antibiofilm activity in vitro was discovered recently. The spectrophotometric method and the XTT {2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2H-tetrazoliu m hydroxide} reduction assay used for data generation make it possible to evaluate fungal biofilm growth accurately. The combined use of the most commonly used methods, the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) and a newly developed method, the DeltaE model, which uses the concentration-effect relationship over the whole concentration range instead of using the MIC index alone, makes the interpretation of results more reliable. As an attractive tool for studying the pharmacodynamics of antimicrobial agents, time-kill curves can provide detailed information about antimicrobial efficacy as a function of both time and concentration. In the present study, in vitro interactions between aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA]) and amphotericin B (AMB) against planktonic cells and biofilm cells of Candida albicans and C. parapsilosis were evaluated by the checkerboard microdilution method and the time-kill test. Synergistic and indifferent effects were found for the combination of ASA and AMB against planktonic cells, while strong synergy was found against biofilm cells analyzed by FICI. The DeltaE model gave more consistent results with FICI. The positive interactions in concentration were also confirmed by the time-kill test. Moreover, this approach also revealed the pharmacodynamics changes of ASA and synergistic action on time. Our findings suggest a potential clinical use for combination therapy with ASA and AMB to augment activity against biofilm-associated infections.
