Ceftaroline (PPI 0903, formerly TAK-599), the active metabolite of a N-phosphono prodrug, ceftaroline fosamil, has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. This antimicrobial agent binds to penicillin binding proteins (PBP) inhibiting cell wall synthesis and has a high affinity for PBP2a, which is associated with methicillin resistance. Ceftaroline is consistently active against multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant, vancomycin-intermediate, linezolid-resistant, and daptomycin-nonsusceptible strains. It possesses variable activity against Enterobacteriaceae and good activity against oral anaerobes. The drug is usually administrated intravenously at 600 mg every 12 h. Ceftaroline has low protein binding and is excreted by the kidneys and thus requires dose adjustments in individuals with renal failure. Clinical trials have demonstrated noninferiority when compared with vancomycin in the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections and noninferiority when compared with ceftriaxone in the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. Ceftaroline demonstrated a safety profile similar to that of comparator drugs in clinical trials.
