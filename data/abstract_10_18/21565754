Treatment of chronic hepatitis B is still challenging. Lots of parameters are needed to be considered before and during the therapy. There are several possible endpoints and their durability is very much variable. Patients with HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative hepatitis B need treatment. Two different strategies are available. Interferon-based therapy is a limited treatment, which might result in a sustained immune response in about one third of the patients, leading to an induced remission, sometimes years after the end of the treatment. According to the other strategy a continuous, indefinite oral nucleoside/nucleotide analogue (NA) treatment is administered to maintain a remission. However, relapse is rather frequent after the cessation of this therapy. During the long-term NA treatment drug resistance can lead to the loss of antiviral effect. Three first-line drugs are recommended, pegylated interferon alfa-2a, entecavir and tenofovir. If there is no contraindication to interferon, it is worth trying to achieve immune control and an induced remission. In patients, who do not respond to interferon, a sequential NA therapy is indicated.
