OBJECTIVES: Dolutegravir shows a high barrier to resistance with no previously reported cases of acquired integrase mutations during first-line therapy. In this study, rapid development of the G118R mutation arose following a switch from first-line elvitegravir/cobicistat/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine to dolutegravir monotherapy. The G118R mutation also arose in a treatment-experienced patient switched to dolutegravir monotherapy. The genetic basis for G118R selection and potential phenotypic outcome was ascertained. PATIENT AND METHODS: Genotypic analysis was performed on patients with virological failure (<1000 copies/mL) on dolutegravir-containing regimens. The Los Alamos database was queried for glycine codon 118 polymorphisms. Cell culture selections and phenotypic drug susceptibility assays assessed resistance via the G118R pathway. RESULTS: We report on two patients who developed viral failure while on dolutegravir monotherapy. Both patients had been on a current or previous regimen containing integrase inhibitors. Virological failure (<1000 copies/mL) emerged early within 2 months following the dolutegravir switch. The appearance of G118R in these two cases and subtype C and CRF02_AG in vitro selections were related to a rare GGA natural polymorphism at codon 118 (1.5% prevalence), facilitating a GGA to AGA transition. Cell culture selections were used to assess the in vitro progression of the G118R pathway leading to cross-resistance to all integrase inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Although resistance to dolutegravir is typically rare, genetic polymorphisms and monotherapy can facilitate the acquisition of G118R.
