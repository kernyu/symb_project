Pseudopterosins and pseudopteroxazole are intriguing marine natural products that possess notable antimicrobial activity with a commensurate lack of cytotoxicity. New semi-synthetic pseudopteroxazoles, pseudopteroquinoxalines and pseudopterosin congeners along with simple synthetic mimics of the terpene skeleton were synthesized. In order to build structure-activity relationships, a set of 29 new and previously reported compounds was assessed for in vitro antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities. A number of congeners exhibited antimicrobial activity against a range of Gram-positive bacteria including Mycobacterium tuberculosis H(3)(7)Rv, with four displaying notable antitubercular activity against both replicating and non-replicating persistent forms of M. tuberculosis. One new semi-synthetic compound, 21-((1H-imidazol-5-yl)methyl)-pseudopteroxazole (7a), was more potent than the natural products pseudopterosin and pseudopteroxazole and exhibited equipotent activity against both replicating and non-replicating persistent forms of M.tuberculosis with a near absence of in vitro cytotoxicity. Pseudopteroxazole also exhibited activity against strains of M. tuberculosis H(3)(7)Rv resistant to six clinically used antibiotics.
