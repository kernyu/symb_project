One exercise session can induce subsequently elevated insulin sensitivity that is largely attributable to greater insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by skeletal muscle. Because skeletal muscle is a heterogeneous tissue comprised of diverse fiber types, our primary aim was to determine exercise effects on insulin-independent and insulin-dependent glucose uptake by single fibers of different fiber types. We hypothesized that each fiber type featuring elevated insulin-independent glucose uptake immediately postexercise (IPEX) would be characterized by increased insulin-dependent glucose uptake at 3.5 h postexercise (3.5hPEX). Rat epitrochlearis muscles were isolated and incubated with 2-[(3)H]deoxyglucose. Muscles from IPEX and sedentary (SED) controls were incubated without insulin. Muscles from 3.5hPEX and SED controls were incubated +/- insulin. Glucose uptake (2-[(3)H]deoxyglucose accumulation) and fiber type (myosin heavy chain isoform expression) were determined for single fibers dissected from the muscles. Major new findings included the following: 1) insulin-independent glucose uptake was increased IPEX in single fibers of each fiber type (types I, IIA, IIB, IIBX, and IIX), 2) glucose uptake values from insulin-stimulated type I and IIA fibers exceeded the values for the other fiber types, 3) insulin-stimulated glucose uptake for type IIX exceeded IIB fibers, and 4) the 3.5hPEX group vs. SED had greater insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in type I, IIA, IIB, and IIBX but not type IIX fibers. Insulin-dependent glucose uptake was increased at 3.5hPEX in each fiber type except for IIX fibers, although insulin-independent glucose uptake was increased IPEX in all fiber types (including type IIX). Single fiber analysis enabled the discovery of this fiber type-related difference for postexercise, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake.
