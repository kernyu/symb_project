Shigellosis is a disease of public health importance in developing countries. It may cause self-limited diarrhea to severe dysentery. Emergence of multi drug resistant (MDR) strains is a growing concern globally. Ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin are the drugs of choice for MDR cases. Here, we report a case of MDR Shigella flexneri from an immunocompromised patient. The strain was resistant to ceftriaxone [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) >/= 64 mug/ml], limiting the treatment option. Simultaneously, the strain was also found to be resistant to ciprofloxacin (MIC >/= 4 mug/ml). However, it was susceptible to ceftazidime (MIC 4 mug/ml). This is the first case of ceftriaxone resistant Shigella spp. reported from our hospital.
