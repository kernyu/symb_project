The authors report on the current status of work on residues of veterinary medicinal products and, in particular, antimicrobial residues in foods of animal origin. This review focuses on residues of veterinary antimicrobials, antimicrobials used in livestock production, the concept of residues, and antimicrobial residues in foods of animal origin. Only one antimicrobial substance has been approved in the West African Economic and Monetary Union, compared with 16 substances in Benin and 56 in the European Union. The issue of antimicrobial residues in foods of animal origin has rarely been a serious concern in developing countries, in contrast to the situation in Europe. However, while the prevalence of veterinary drug residues in foods of animal origin is less than 1% in Europe, in some African countries it can be as high as 94%. Antimicrobial residues in foods of animal origin can cause allergies, cancer, alterations in the intestinal flora, bacterial resistance and the inhibition of fermentation in the dairy industry. The harmonisation of regulations in Africa could reduce the circulation of prohibited antimicrobials and lead to the implementation of a plan for the control and surveillance of residues from veterinary medicinal products in foods of animal origin.
