Twenty-nine Kanamycin resistant clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from Northern India were screened to evaluate genetic mutations in rrs gene, eis gene with its promoter, and whiB7 gene along with its 5'UTR. 14 strains (~48.0%) collectively exhibited mutations in rrs, eis or whiB7 target regions. While the highest frequency of mutations was found in rrs gene, eis and whiB7 loci displayed novel mutations. The novel mutations displayed by eis and whiB7 loci were found to be associated specifically with the Kanamycin resistance as none of the twenty nine Kanamycin sensitive strains harbor them. The inclusion of novel mutations of eis and whiB7 loci will be useful in improving the specificity of future diagnostics.
