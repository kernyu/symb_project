Alcohol consumption induces liver steatosis; therefore, this study investigated the possible role of adipose tissue dysfunction in the pathogenesis of alcoholic steatosis. Mice were pair-fed an alcohol or control liquid diet for 8 weeks to evaluate the alcohol effects on lipid metabolism at the adipose tissue-liver axis. Chronic alcohol exposure reduced adipose tissue mass and adipocyte size. Fatty acid release from adipose tissue explants was significantly increased in alcohol-fed mice in association with the activation of adipose triglyceride lipase and hormone-sensitive lipase. Alcohol exposure induced insulin intolerance and inactivated adipose protein phosphatase 1 in association with the up-regulation of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3). Alcohol exposure up-regulated fatty acid transport proteins and caused lipid accumulation in the liver. To define the mechanistic link between adipose triglyceride loss and hepatic triglyceride gain, mice were first administered heavy water for 5 weeks to label adipose triglycerides with deuterium, and then pair-fed alcohol or control diet for 2 weeks. Deposition of deuterium-labeled adipose triglycerides in the liver was analyzed using Fourier transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometry. Alcohol exposure increased more than a dozen deuterium-labeled triglyceride molecules in the liver by up to 6.3-fold. These data demonstrate for the first time that adipose triglycerides due to alcohol-induced hyperlipolysis are reverse transported and deposited in the liver.
