BACKGROUND: Dolutegravir has shown in vitro activity against human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2). We report safety and efficacy data of regimens containing dolutegravir (50 mg twice daily) in antiretroviral-experienced, HIV-2-infected patients. METHODS: HIV-2-infected patients experiencing virological failure to raltegravir received dolutegravir with optimized background antiretroviral combinations within the French Named Patient Program (NPP). Plasma HIV-2 RNA (pVL) was assessed at time of dolutegravir initiation (baseline), month 3, and month 6. Antiretroviral trough plasma concentrations (C12h) were determined using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Thirteen HIV-2-infected-patients, with a median duration of 15 years' infection and given 16 previous antiretroviral regimens, were included in NPP. Median follow-up was 9 months (min-max, 3-15 months). Median baseline pVL and CD4 cell count were 9544 copies/mL (inter quartile range [IQR], 3096-23 120 copies/mL) and 100 cells/microL (IQR, 77-171 cells/microL), respectively. Available integrase genotypic resistance patterns were Y143C/G/H/R (n = 5), Q148R/K (n = 2), and N155H (n = 4). Optimized background antiretroviral regimens conferring a genotypic sensitivity score </=2 in 10 patients included nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors associated with darunavir/ritonavir (n = 12), saquinavir/ritonavir (n = 2), and maraviroc (n = 3). At months 3 and 6, pVL was undetectable in 6 of 13 and 4 of 12 patients, respectively, and median CD4 count was 161 (101-188) cells/microL and 167 (135-1353) cells/microL, respectively. Median dolutegravir C12h was 4086 (1756-5717 ng/mL) ng/mL in 9 patients. No serious events were notified except 1 death from progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy at month 4. CONCLUSIONS: Optimized dolutegravir-containing antiretroviral regimens supported by good plasma exposure provide a substantial initial efficacy rate for salvage therapy in heavily antiretroviral-experienced HIV-2-infected patients with virus harboring resistance to first-generation integrase inhibitors. Larger numbers of patients and longer follow-up are needed to confirm these findings.
