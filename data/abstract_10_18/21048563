An outbreak of cholera is ongoing in Haiti. On October 21, 2010, toxigenic Vibrio cholerae O1, serotype Ogawa, biotype El Tor was identified by the National Laboratory of Public Health of the Ministry of Public Health and Population in Haiti. Identification of the isolate was confirmed by CDC. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of selected V. cholerae O1 isolates conducted at the National Laboratory of Public Health and at CDC demonstrated susceptibility to tetracycline (susceptibility to this drug predicts doxycycline susceptibility), ciprofloxacin, and kanamycin; and resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, furazolidone, nalidixic acid, sulfisoxazole, and streptomycin.
