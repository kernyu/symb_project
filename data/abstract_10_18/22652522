BACKGROUND: Community-associated meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has emerged as an important pathogen worldwide in a continent-specific manner. Clinical characteristics of infections caused by CA-MRSA other than USA300, especially in healthcare settings, have not been well established. AIM: To conduct a retrospective cohort study to determine the clinical characteristics of infections caused by Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL)-negative, multilocus sequence type (ST) 72 staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type IV, a major CA-MRSA clone in Korea. METHODS: ST72-IV isolates, which were susceptible to fluoroquinolones, gentamicin, rifampicin, and cotrimoxazole, were presumptively identified among 4667 MRSA isolates and then confirmed by SCCmec typing and multilocus sequence typing. A total of 124 cases of ST72-IV infections were analysed. FINDINGS: The annual incidence of infections by ST72-IV per 100,000 admissions increased from 45.5 to 66.3 cases during 2007-2009. The most frequently occurring type of infection was skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) (46.0%), followed by pneumonia (27.4%) and bone and joint infection (9.7%). Surgical site infection accounted for 22.6% and 32.5% of community-onset (CO) healthcare-associated infection and hospital-onset (HO) infection, respectively. Pneumonia was most frequent (45.0%) among HO infection. Multivariate analysis showed that pneumonia increased the odds of all-cause mortality (odds ratio: 18.8; 95% confidence interval: 2.6-133.9) compared with other types of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing trends were observed in annual incidence of CO and HO infections by ST72-IV in Korea. Pneumonia was the most frequent among HO infection and was associated with higher mortality. These findings pose important implications for successful antibiotic therapy and infection control in the era of CA-MRSA.
