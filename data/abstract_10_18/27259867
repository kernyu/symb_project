Carbapenems are considered the last-resort antibiotics to treat infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli. The Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) enzyme hydrolyses beta-lactam antibiotics including the carbapenems. KPC has been detected worldwide in Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates associated with transposon Tn4401 commonly located in plasmids. Acinetobacter baumannii has become an important multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogen. KPC-producing A. baumannii has been reported to date only in Puerto Rico. The objective of this study was to determine the whole genomic sequence of a KPC-producing A. baumannii in order to (i) define its allelic diversity, (ii) identify the location and genetic environment of the blaKPC and (iii) detect additional mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance. Next-generation sequencing, Southern blot, PFGE, multilocus sequence typing and bioinformatics analysis were performed. The organism was assigned to the international ST2 clone. The blaKPC-2 was identified on a novel truncated version of Tn4401e (tentatively named Tn4401h), located in the chromosome within an IncA/C plasmid fragment derived from an Enterobacteriaceae, probably owing to insertion sequence IS26. A chromosomally located truncated Tn1 transposon harbouring a blaTEM-1 was found in a novel genetic environment within an antimicrobial resistance cluster. Additional resistance mechanisms included efflux pumps, non-beta-lactam antibiotic inactivating enzymes within and outside a resistance island, two class 1 integrons, In439 and the novel In1252, as well as mutations in the topoisomerase and DNA gyrase genes which confer resistance to quinolones. The presence of the blaKPC in an already globally disseminated A. baumannii ST2 presents a serious threat of further dissemination.
