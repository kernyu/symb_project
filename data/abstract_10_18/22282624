A potentially novel antimicrobial compound producing Pediococcus acidilactici LAB 5 was isolated from vacuum-packed fermented meat product. This compound was found active against some species of Enterococcus, Leuconostoc, Staphylococcus and Listeria, many of which are associated with food spoilage and food related health hazards. The strain was found to be a paired cocci which can utilize a broad range of carbohydrates and produce acid identical to the P. acidilactici and P. pentoseus. Since the antimicrobial agent was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes but quite resistant to heat, it was identified as a bacteriocin and was designated as Pediocin NV 5. The molecular weight of the bacteriocin was 10.3 kDa and the bacterium possessed a 5 kbp plasmid responsible for bacteriocin production and also for vancomycin resistance phenotype.
