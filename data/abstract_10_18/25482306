PURPOSE: The emergence of microbial resistance is widely associated with inappropriate antibiotic use. Self-medication with antibiotics acquired directly from pharmacies without a medical prescription has been reported by several European countries as being an important cause of such inappropriate use. The goal of this study was to identify and evaluate community pharmacists attitudes toward and knowledge of antibiotics and microbial resistance and to assess what influence, if any, these attitudes might have on their propensity to dispense unprescribed antibiotics. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study covering all community pharmacists registered with the Official College of Pharmacists in Portugals Central Region. A self-administered questionnaire on attitudes toward microbial resistance and antibiotic use was mailed to 1197 pharmacists. Responses ranged from 0 (total disagreement) to 10 (total agreement). Logistic regression was used to model the association between respondents attitudes and their propensity to dispense antibiotics without an earlier medical prescription. FINDINGS: The overall response rate was 64.8%. Agreement with the dispensing of unprescribed antibiotics was highest in the case of dental diseases and ailments, followed by urinary tract infections. Although none of the sociodemographic data were associated with a propensity to dispense antibiotics without a medical prescription, the attitudes shown to be significantly associated with this propensity were complacency about patients, responsibility of others, and precaution or fear. IMPLICATIONS: Because the attitudes of community pharmacists can influence their readiness to dispense unprescribed antibiotics, educational interventions addressing such attitudes should be implemented to improve antibiotic use.
