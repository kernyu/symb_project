The obtaining of chitosan extruded films was possible by using low density polyethylene (LDPE) as a matrix polymer and ethylene-acrylic acid copolymer as an adhesive, in order to ensure adhesion in the interphase of the immiscible polymers. The obtained blend films were resistant; however, a reduction in the mechanical resistance was observed as chitosan concentration increased. The thermal stability of the films showed a certain grade of interaction between polymers as seen in FTIR spectra. The antifungal activity of the extruded films was assessed against Aspergillus niger and high inhibition percentages were observed, which may be mainly attributed to barrier properties of the extruded films and the limited oxygen availability, resulting in the inability of the fungi to grow. A low adherence of fungal spores to the material surface was observed, mainly in areas with chitosan clumps, which can serve as starting points for material degradation.
