In order to deal with the complexity of biological systems at the atomic level, limiting assumptions are often made which do not reflect the reality of the system under study. One example is the assumption that the entropy of binding of the macromolecule is not influenced significantly by the different ligands. Recent experimental data on ligands binding to HIV-1 protease challenge this assumption.
