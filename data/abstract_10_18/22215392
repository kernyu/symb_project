BACKGROUND: Macrolide and lincosamide resistance in Streptococcus pyogenes is due to the acquisition of mef, ermB and ermA genes, which confer different resistance phenotypes, namely M, MLSBconstitutive and MLSBinducible respectively. The last report of resistance in Chile was done in the period 1990-1998, in which resistance to macrolides was 5.4%, with M phenotype as the predominant one. AIM: To characterize the evolution of erythromycin and clindamycin resistance and their associated genes in S. pyogenes strains isolated from patients with invasive and non-invasive infections in the period 1996 to 2005. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin was determined in 1,282 clinical isolates using the disk diffusion test. Resistant isolates were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of the above mentioned resistance genes. RESULTS: Global resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin was 3.5 and 0.7% respectively. Eighty percent of the resistant strains possessed the M. phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance levels of S. pyogenes have decreased in Chile in the last years. Most resistant strains have M phenotype in contrast to many countries in which the MLSB constitutive phenotype is the predominant one.
