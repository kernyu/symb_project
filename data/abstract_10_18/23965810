BACKGROUND: To assess the incidence of antimicrobial resistance of L. monocytogenes strains isolated from humans and foods in the Czech Republic in the period of 2001 to 2012. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Phenotypic resistance testing has been monitored by the disk diffusion method and complemented by the assessment of minimum inhibitory concentration by E-test method and genes encoding resistance by the PCR method. RESULTS: All tested strains (678) were susceptible to ampicillin, penicillin, gentamicin, trimethoprim, vancomycin and chloramphenicol. Resistance to tetracycline (2/509) and erythromycin (1/509) was detected sporadically in strains of food origin. CONCLUSIONS: Very good and so far stable susceptibility of tested strains of L. monocytogenes isolated from humans and foods to antibiotics used in the therapy of listeriosis was found in the monitoring period. Sporadic occurrence of resistance was detected only in strains from foods.
