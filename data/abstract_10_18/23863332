Phytochemical investigation of the seeds of Salacia longipes var. camerunensis led to the isolation of four sesquiterpenoid derivatives, salaterpene A (1) (1alpha,2beta,8beta-triacetoxy-6beta,9beta-dibenzoyloxy-4beta-hydroxy-dihydro-bet a-agarofuran), salaterpene B (2) (1alpha,2beta,8beta-triacetoxy-9beta-benzoyloxy-6beta-cinnamoyloxy-4beta-hydroxy- dihydro-beta-agarofuran), salaterpene C (3) (1alpha,2beta-diacetoxy-6beta,9beta-dibenzoyloxy-4beta-hydroxy-dihydro-beta-agaro furan) and salaterpene D (4) (2beta-acetoxy-1alpha,6beta-dibenzoyloxy-4beta-hydroxy-9beta-nicotinoyloxy-dihydr o-beta-agarofuran) together with two known compounds (5 and 6). The structures of the compounds were established by means of NMR spectroscopy. Compounds 1-4 and 6 were tested in vitro for their antiplasmodial activity against Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine-resistant strain W2. All the tested compounds exhibited a moderate potency with IC50 below 2.7 muM.
