Fusarium species are reported frequently as the most common causative agents of fungal keratitis in tropical countries such as India. Sixty-five fusaria isolated from patients were subjected to multilocus DNA sequencing to characterize the spectrum of the species associated with keratitis infections in India. Susceptibilities of these fusaria to ten antifungals were determined in vitro by the broth microdilution method. An impressive phylogenetic diversity of fusaria was reflected in susceptibilities differing at species level. Typing results revealed that the isolates were distributed among species in the species complexes (SCs) of F. solani (FSSC; n = 54), F. oxysporum (FOSC; n = 1), F. fujikuroi (FFSC; n = 3), and F. dimerum (FDSC; n = 7). Amphotericin B, voriconazole, and clotrimazole proved to be the most effective drugs, followed by econazole.
