Methicillin and multi-drug resistance were investigated in 136 Staphylococcus intermedius strains of canine origin. The large majority of isolates were found to be mecA-negative by polymerase chain reaction, whereas only four strains were positive for the mecA gene. All mecA-positive strains were confirmed as methicillin-resistant by complementary tests, except for oxacillin disk diffusion, which yielded one false-negative result. A significantly higher resistance to fusidic acid, lincosamides, and cotrimoxazole was observed in methicillin-resistant S. intermedius (MRSI) compared with methicillin-susceptible strains. Although the prevalence of MRSI in dogs appeared to be low, methicillin resistance was confirmed to be associated with multi-drug resistance, suggesting the importance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing of canine S. intermedius strains.
