Acceptable performance of grazing cattle frequently depends on the availability of effective broad-spectrum anthelmintics to remove, or prevent infection with, gastrointestinal nematodes. This control is increasingly threatened by populations of nematodes resistant to the most commonly used anthelmintics. Although this appears to have developed more slowly than in nematodes infecting small ruminants, the number of reports in the literature over the past five years suggests a rapidly escalating problem. This review discusses this literature, several issues unique to cattle parasitism and anthelmintics, and how previous research in small ruminants can improve the management of anthelmintic resistance in cattle.
