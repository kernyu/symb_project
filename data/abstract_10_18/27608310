Directed treatment of infections due to multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli is a difficult task, since it requires the use of a limited number of antibiotics that are often more toxic and possibly less efficacious than beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones. Furthermore, there are very few controlled trials informing on the relative efficacy of different therapeutic strategies. As a general rule, it is recommended to use at least two active drugs or a combination with proven synergistic activity in vitro, because several observational studies have associated this practice with better outcomes and as a measure to potentially curb the emergence of further resistance. It is already available a new cephalosporin active against most strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to ceftazidime due to derepression of ampC and in the near future an effective inhibitor of class A, class C and OXA-48 will be available which combined with ceftazidime is expected to mean a significant addition to the armamentarium against Gram-negative bacilli with these resistance determinants.
