Chemotherapy is an important therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment and remains the mainstay for the management of human malignancies; however, chemotherapy fails to eliminate all tumor cells because of intrinsic or acquired drug resistance, which is the most common cause of tumor recurrence. Recently, emerging evidences suggest that Notch signaling pathway is one of the most important signaling pathways in drug-resistant tumor cells. Moreover, down-regulation of Notch pathway could induce drug sensitivity, leading to increased inhibition of cancer cell growth, invasion, and metastasis. This article will provide a brief overview of the published evidences in support of the roles of Notch in drug resistance and will further summarize how targeting Notch by "natural agents" could become a novel and safer approach for the improvement of tumor treatment by overcoming drug resistance.
