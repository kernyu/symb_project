A high prevalence of fusC (16/46, 59%) was found in fusidic acid-resistant methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates collected from 2008 to 2010. Nucleotide sequencing of fusC and flanking regions revealed a novel staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC) structure, SCCfusC, which was integrated into rlmH and located upstream from SCCmec. The SCCfusC element contained speG, which may contribute to the polyamine resistance.
