Resistance to second line anti tubercular drugs is a cause of serious concern. The present study reports the prevalence of Ofloxacin (OFX) and Kanamycin (KM) resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from cases of pulmonary tuberculosis, who received anti tubercular treatment for >4 weeks in past. Of total 438 enrolled patients, 361 were culture positive for M. tuberculosis, of which, 95 (26.3%) were OFX resistant & 49 (13.5%) were KM resistant. Total 130 isolates were Multidrug resistant, of which, 55 (42.3%) were resistant to either OFX or KM (Pre-XDR) & 11 (8.5%) were resistant to both KM & OFX (XDR). Resistance to quinolones & aminoglycosides should be routinely assessed in areas endemic for tuberculosis.
