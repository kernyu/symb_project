Plasmid-mediated resistance to polymyxins mediated by the MCR-1/2 determinants has been reported in Enterobacteriaceae worldwide. Using PCR-based and cloning strategies, a series of Moraxella spp. were screened for mcr-like genes. Moraxella spp. that are mainly animal pathogens but may also be human pathogens were identified as potential reservoirs of mcr-like genes.
