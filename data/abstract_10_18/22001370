In the present work, we evaluate in vitro the cytosolic and microsomal activity of glutathione-S-transferases in adults of Fasciola hepatica susceptible (Cullompton Strain) and resistant (Sligo Strain) to triclabendazole. The triclabendazole resistant (Sligo) fluke expressed significant major metabolic activity of glutathione-S-transferases compared to that measured in the cytosolic and microsomal fractions obtained from susceptible flukes (Cullompton Strain). The results associated with previous data where the Sligo Strain overexpress Flavin Monooxigenase confirm a multienzymatic response involving more than one metabolic pathway.
