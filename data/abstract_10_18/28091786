Bacterial drug resistance and uropathogenic tract infections are among the most important issues of current medicine. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains are the primary factor of this issue. This article is the continuation of the previous study, where we used Kohonen relations to predict the direction of drug resistance. The characterized collection of uropathogenic E. coli strains was used for microbiological (the disc diffusion method for antimicrobial susceptibility testing), chemical (ATR/FT-IR) and mathematical (artificial neural networks, Ward's hierarchical clustering method, the analysis of distributions of inhibition zone diameters for antibiotics, Cohen's kappa measure of agreement) analysis. This study presents other potential tools for the epidemiological differentiation of E. coli strains. It is noteworthy that ATR/FT-IR technique has turned out to be useful for the quick and simple identification of MDR strains. Also, diameter zones of resistance of this E. coli population were compared to the population of E. coli strains published by EUCAST. We observed the bacterial behaviors toward particular antibiotics in comparison to EUCAST bacterial collections. Additionally, we used Cohen's kappa to show which antibiotics from the same class are closely related to each other and which are not. The presented associations between antibiotics may be helpful in selecting the proper therapy directions. Here we present an adaptation of interdisciplinary studies of drug resistance of E. coli strains for epidemiological and clinical investigations. The obtained results may be some indication in deciding on antibiotic therapy.
