OBJECTIVES: To identify the age- and sex-specific antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) in outpatient febrile urinary tract infections (UTIs) in Korea. METHODS: A total 2262 consecutive samples collected from patients aged 1-101 years with febrile UTIs, during the period January 2012 to December 2014, were analyzed in this multicentre, retrospective cohort study. RESULTS: The sensitivities to cefotaxime and cefoxitin were over 85% for females but under 75% for males. Sex played an important role in the susceptibility of GNB to cefotaxime (p<0.001) and cefoxitin (p<0.001). The sensitivity to ciprofloxacin (age >20 years) was under 75% in both sexes, and was not influenced by sex (p=0.204). Age distributions of the incidences of resistance to cefotaxime, cefoxitin, and ciprofloxacin (age >20 years) were similar to the age distribution of the incidence of GNB, which indicates that the resistance patterns to these drugs were not affected by age (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, female/male: p=0.927/p=0.509, p=0.193/p=0.911, and p=0.077/p=0.999, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Age is not a considerable factor in determining the antibiotic resistance in febrile UTIs. Ciprofloxacin should be withheld from both sexes until culture results indicate its use. Second- or third-generation cephalosporins such as cefoxitin and cefotaxime can be used empirically only in females.
