The fungicide fludioxonil is used to control plant-pathogenic fungi by causing improper activation of the Hog1-type MAPK. However, the appearance of fludioxonil resistant mutants, mostly caused by mutations in the group III histidine kinases, poses a serious problem. Moreover, such mutations cause also hyperosmotic sensitivity and the underlying mechanism has been elusive for a long time. Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as an experimental host, we show that those phenotypes are conferred by a constitutively active form of the group III histidine kinase. Our results explain the different reasons for fludioxonil resistance conferred by its deletion and missense mutation.
