We herein report a case of Klebsiella oxytoca-producing IMP-1 that was detected as a first isolate of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) at our facility. Since K. oxytoca is an uncommon strain for CRE, we speculated that the resistant organism had already spread out inside the hospital. Metallo-beta-lactamases promotes antibiotic resistance in Enterobacteriaceae, which potentially yields problematic issues in clinical settings. Active surveillance of antibiotic resistant strains is important and should be repeatedly highlighted. Furthermore, appropriate methods should be established to detect highly resistant strains.
