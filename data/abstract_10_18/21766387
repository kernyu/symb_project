Protaetiamycine is an insect defensin, derived from the larvae of the beetle Protaetia brevitarsis. In our previous work, we designed 9-mer peptide analogs of protaetiamycine, including 9Pbw2 (RLWLAIKRR-NH(2) ), 9Pbw3 (RLWLAIWRR-NH(2) ), and 9Pbw4 (RLWLAWKRR-NH(2) ). 9Pbw2 and 9Pbw4 showed high antimicrobial activity without cytotoxicity, while 9Pbw3 with higher hydrophobicity compared to 9Pbw2 and 9Pbw4 showed high cytotoxicity as well as high antimicrobial activity (Shin et al., J. Pept. Sci. 2009; 15: 559-568). In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory activities of 9Pbw2, 9Pbw3, and 9Pbw4 by quantitation of NO production in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. The results showed that only 9Pbw3 has strong inhibition of NO production, implying that Trp(7) as well as optimum level of hydrophobicity may play key roles in the anti-inflammatory activity of 9Pbw3. In order to design potent anti-inflammatory peptide with lower cytotoxicity as well as high stability from cleavage by protease compared to 9Pbw3, we synthesized 9Pbw3-D, the all-D-amino acid analog of 9Pbw3. 9Pbw3-D showed less cytotoxicity against RAW264.7 cells as well as considerably stronger inhibition of NO production and inflammation-induced cytokine production in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells than 9Pbw3. 9Pbw3-D inhibited the gene expression of inflammatory-induced cytokine significantly more than 9Pbw3 and showed high resistance to proteolytic digestion. Binding of 9Pbw3-D with LPS caused higher enhancement of the FITC fluorescence as a result of its stronger interaction with LPS compared to that of 9Pbw3 and this result is in good agreement with their anti-inflammatory activities. 9Pbw3-D with higher anti-inflammatory activity as well as lower cytotoxicity against mammalian cell compared to 9Pbw3 can be a potent noncytotoxic antibiotic candidates.
