Sulfamide-resistant (SulR) natural strains of enterobacteria (11.9% of a total of 797 cultures, isolated with enteric microflora of honeybee gut, bee-fermented pollen, and plant issues) were tested for class 1 antibiotic resistance integrons (MRI). Only 5.3% of SulR strains were MRI-positive. Mutability of weak (wild type) MRI promotor has been shown. A more active hybrid promotor type has been amplified in isolated Klebsiella oxytoca strains. Regulatory genetic modifications in MRI are fraught with the development of multiple drug resistance of opportunistic strains.
