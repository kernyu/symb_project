BACKGROUND: The role of bacterial colonization in hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) lesions is poorly understood. To date, data on the related microbial profile and especially on bacterial resistance rates are scarce. METHODS: The results of bacterial cultures and susceptibility patterns of the isolated microorganisms obtained from deep portions of HS lesions from patients who underwent surgery at our HS Centre between 2010 and 2015 were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: Analyses of 113 bacterial samples from 113 HS patients revealed bacterial growth in 95 samples (84.1%). Polymicrobial growth was found in 51 samples (45.1%). Coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus were the most commonly isolated bacteria, followed by Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. Data on susceptibility testing were available for 68 samples, which yielded 129 isolates. The isolated strains were primarily resistant to penicillin G, followed by erythromycin, clindamycin and ampicillin. The highest effectiveness against isolates was observed for fosfomycin, imipenem, fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin), and cotrimoxazole. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings on bacterial species and their topographical distribution revealed that the microbial flora in HS lesions reflects commensal flora of the skin. Due to the susceptibility rate and immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties, cotrimoxazole may represent an alternative antibiotic agent and should be considered for therapy in HS patients.
