Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a major cause of hospital-acquired (HA-SA) and community-acquired (CA-SA) infections worldwide. It is isolated from many human body sites, from animals and from foods, from the environment. Pathogenesis is caused by many virulence factors and antibiotic resistance. The host immune system tries to keep under control this pathogen, but many virulence factors produced by this under the regulatory systems control attack the immune system. The epidemiology of S. aureus is in permanent dynamic and is changing quickly. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor infections, to find new effective molecules and vaccines against this pathogen. In order to reduce this problem which affects public health as a whole, the search for new therapeutic alternatives must be associated with policies to control antibiotic use. Community-acquired and hospital-acquired infections epidemiological surveillance guided by scientific studies should be constant habits among health professionals and hospitals.
