INTRODUCTION: Candida dubliniensis, a new species of Candida that has been recovered from several sites in healthy people, has been associated with recurrent episodes of oral candidiasis in AIDS and HIV-positive patients. This species is closely related to C. albicans. The enzymatic activity of C. dubliniensis in response to oxidative stress is of interest for the development of drugs to combat C. dubliniensis. METHODS: Fluconazole- and amphotericin B-resistant strains were generated as described by Fekete-Forgacs et al. (2000). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase assays were performed as described by McCord and Fridovich (1969) and Aebi (1984), respectively. RESULTS: We demonstrated that superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities were significantly higher (p<0.05) in the fluconazole- and amphotericin B-resistant strains of C. dubliniensis and C. albicans than in the sensitive strains. The catalase and SOD activities were also significantly (p<0.01) higher in the sensitive and resistant C. albicans strains than in the respective C. dubliniensis strains. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that C. albicans is better protected from oxidative stress than C. dubliniensis and that fluconazole, like amphotericin B, can induce oxidative stress in Candida; oxidative stress induces an adaptive response that results in a coordinated increase in catalase and SOD activities.
