A total of 1,000 rectal samples were collected from rabbits coming from 25 rabbit farms in southern Italy. All samples were processed for isolation of Salmonella spp. by standard culture method based on the ISO 6579:2002 method. Salmonella spp. was isolated from 1/25 rabbit farms analyzed. In particular, four out of 1,000 rectal swab samples, taken from young rabbits, were serotyped as S. Typhimurium and phage typed as S. Typhimurium DT104. All the isolates were resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline (ACSSuT pentaresistance type). The findings of the present study suggest the rabbit as potential carrier of S. Typhimurium DT104.
