Aims & Objectives: The aim of this study is to evaluate genetic relatedness, antibiotic resistance pattern, and virulence characteristics of different types of S. aureus isolated from air, surfaces, staff, and patients in a Public hospital in Ilam. Methods & Materials: A total of 88 of 140 staphylococci identified as S. aureus by conventional and molecular methods were used in this study. Isolate samples were obtained from surfaces, staff, patients, and hospital indoor air. The sampling from staff and surfaces was done through using swab and air by standard pump. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing and presence different resistant and virulence determinants was assessed. Isolates were then typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and SCCmec typing methods. Results: Out of 88isolates, 36 of them (40.9%) were MRSA. Among MRSA isolates, the range of resistance to antibiotic was 0% in vancomycin to 83.3% in gentamycin. The most prevalent resistant genes among gentamicin resistant S. aureus were acc (6')/aph (2")Ia and aph(3")IIIa. The most common erythromycin resistant gene was ermC. Surprisingly, SCCmec types I (30.5%), II (25%)were highly distributed. PFGE analysis showed 33 different pulsotypes. Conclusion: This study confirms that different isolates of MSSA and MRSA circulate in Ilam which differ in antimicrobial susceptibility, content of resistance, and virulence determinants.
