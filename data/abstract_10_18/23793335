Schistosomiasis control is widely dependent on a single drug, praziquantel (PZQ). The potential for development of resistance to PZQ has justified the search for new alternative chemotherapies. In a previous study, we have been reported that three of 8-hydroxyquinoline derivatives namely: 3-((8-hydroxyquinolin-5-yl) sulfonyl) pentane-2,4-dione (HQSP), 5-((2,4-diphenyl-3H-benzo[b][1,4]diazepin-3-yl) sulfonyl) quinolin-8-ol (HQBD), and 5-((2,4-diphenyl-3H-pyrido[3,4-b][1,4] diazepin-3-yl) sulfonyl) quinolin-8-ol (HQPD) possess a potent anti-schistosomal activity in vitro. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the in vivo schistosomicidal effect of these three compounds on adult and immature worms of Schistosoma mansoni and their induced pathology. Treatment of S. mansoni-infected mice with 1000, 250, 150, and 200 mg/kg body weight of PZQ, HQSP, HQBD, and HQPD, respectively, reduced adult and immature worm burden by 94.63 and 31.32%, 73.63 and 5.45%, 76.5 and 28.11%, and 81.25 and 56.84%, respectively, compared to infected untreated mice. Moreover, numbers of egg per gram liver and intestine were decreased by 84 and 95.51%, 47.84 and 46.28 %, 53.18 and 59.37 %, and 54.22 and 67.26 as a result of PZQ, HQSP, HQBD, and HQPD treatment, respectively. Hepatic granuloma volume was also reduced by 40.10, 42.96, 35.72, and 72.09% due to PZQ, HQSP, HQBD, and HQPD treatment, respectively. In addition, hepatic histopathological alterations and collagen fiber deposition that accompanied with S. mansoni infection were largely retrieved with different treatments, especially HQPD treatment. Furthermore, humoral immune response, especially IgG response against S. mansoni antigens, was augmented with different treatments. This study concluded that among the three tested 8-hydroxyquinoline derivatives, HQPD is the most effective compound against adult and pre-mature worms of S. mansoni and can be used for the development of a new schistosomicidal drug.
