Campylobacter fetus is a Gram negative bacterium recognized for its virulence in animals and humans. This bacterium possesses a paracrystalline array of high molecular weight proteins known as surface-layer proteins covering its cell surface. A mathematical model has been made of the outer membrane of this bacterium, both with its surface-layer proteins (S+) and without (S-). Monte Carlo computer simulation was used to understand the stability of the surface-layer protein structure as a function of ionic concentration. The interactions of an electrically-charged antimicrobial agent, the cationic antimicrobial peptide protamine, with surface-layer proteins and with the lipopolysaccharides of the outer membrane were modeled and analyzed. We found that (1) divalent ions stabilize the surface-layer protein array by reducing the fluctuations perpendicular and parallel to the membrane plane thereby promoting adhesion to the LPS region. This was achieved via (2) divalent ions bridging the negatively-charged LPS Core. The effect of this bridging is to bring individual Core regions closer together so that the O-antigens can (3) increase their attractive van der Waals interactions and "collapse" to form a surface with reduced perpendicular fluctuations. These findings provide support for the proposal of Yang et al. [1]. (4) No evidence for a significant increase in Ca(2+) concentration in the region of the surface-layer protein subunits was observed in S+ simulations compared to S- simulations. (5) We predicted the trends of protamine MIC tests performed on C. fetus and these were in good agreement with our experimental results.
