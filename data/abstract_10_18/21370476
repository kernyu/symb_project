As part of our studies focused on the design of 1-[((hetero)aryl- and piperidinylmethyl)amino]-2-phenyl-3-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)propan-2-ols as antifungal agents, we report the development of new extended benzylamine derivatives substituted at the para position by sulfonamide or retrosulfonamide groups linked to alkyl or aryl chains. These molecules have broad-spectrum antifungal activities not only against Candida spp., including fluconazole-resistant strains, but also against a filamentous species (A. fumigatus). Concerning fluconazole resistance, selected compounds exhibit the capacity to overcome CDR and ERG11 gene upregulation and to maintain antifungal activity despite a recognized critical CYP51 substitution in C. albicans isolates. Synthesis, investigation of the mechanism of action by sterol analysis in a C. albicans strain, and structure-activity relationships (SARs) are reported.
