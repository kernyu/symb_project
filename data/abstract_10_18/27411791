A 19-year old woman with acute myeloid leukemia presented with newly observed liver lesions during ongoing consolidation therapy. Due to unexplained cholestasis during induction, biliary duct drainage was performed. Microbiologic and histologic examinations revealed the presence of atypical mycobacteria, namely Mycobacterium abscessus. With an appropriate antiinfective regime which was continuously administered using a portable pump in the outpatient setting, further mycobacterial spread during simultaneous chemotherapy-associated neutropenia was prevented. Despite multiple bacterial resistance mechanisms, proper treatment of leukemia with curative intention could be ensured.
