The in vitro activities of eight antifungal drugs against clinical isolates of Fonsecaea pedrosoi (n = 21), Fonsecaea monophora (n = 25), and Fonsecaea nubica (n = 9) were tested. The resulting MIC(90)s for all strains (n = 55) were as follows, in increasing order: posaconazole, 0.063 microg/ml; itraconazole, 0.125 microg/ml; isavuconazole, 0.25 microg/ml; voriconazole, 0.5 microg/ml; amphotericin B, 2 microg/ml; caspofungin, 2 microg/ml; anidulafungin, 2 microg/ml; and fluconazole, 32 microg/ml.
