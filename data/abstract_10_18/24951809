Three unrelated sequence type 131 (ST131), ST58, and ST83 Escherichia coli isolates with low-level resistance to imipenem and resistance to ertapenem were recovered in a Spanish hospital from July to October 2012. They were positive for blaOXA-48 carried by an IncL/M conjugative plasmid, which may have been acquired from Klebsiella pneumoniae.
