Praziquantel is currently the only drug of choice for the treatment of human schistosomiases. However, it has been proved that Schistosoma japonicum subjected to drug pressure may develop resistance to praziquantel. To evaluate the efficacy of dihydroartemisinin against praziquantel-resistant S. japonicum, mice infected with a praziquantel-resistant isolate and a praziquantel-susceptible isolate of S. japonicum were treated with dihydroartemisinin at a single oral dose of 300 mg/kg given once on each of 35-36 post-infection days, while infected but untreated mice served as controls. All mice were sacrificed 50 days post-infection, and the worm burden reductions were estimated. Administration of dihydroartemisinin at a single oral dose of 300 mg/kg on each of 35-36 post-infection days reduced total worm burdens of 69.8% and female worm burdens of 86% in mice infected with the praziquantel-susceptible isolate, and total worm burdens of 66.1% and female worm burdens of 85.1% in mice infected with the praziquantel-resistant isolate (both P values > 0.05). It is concluded that the sensitivity of artemisinin derivative dihydroartemisinin does not reduce in praziquantel-resistant S. japonicum.
