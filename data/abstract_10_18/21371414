The first case of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in Italy was reported in 2009. We performed a study over a period of seven months in 2010 to survey the circulation of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPC) ina 1,500-bed university hospital in northern Italy and report the presence and rapid increase of these multidrug-resistant bacteria. The results raise a major concern about these pathogens and demonstrate the urgent need for infection control and antibiotic stewardship programmes.
