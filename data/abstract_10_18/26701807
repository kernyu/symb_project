Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus, GBS) infection remains a major problem associated with high mortality of cultured tilapia worldwide. The present study reports the serotype distribution and antimicrobial susceptibilities of GBS isolated from infected tilapia cultured in Thailand. One hundred and forty-four GBS isolates were identified by biochemical, serological and molecular analyses. Of these 144 GBS isolates, 126 were serotype Ia and 18 were serotype III. Antimicrobial susceptibilities of the 144 GBS isolates were determined by the disc diffusion method. Most GBS isolates were susceptible to lincomycin, norfloxacin, oxytetracycline, ampicillin, erythromycin and chloramphenicol, but resistant to oxolinic acid, gentamicin, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. However, 17 isolates displayed an oxytetracycline-resistant phenotype and harboured the tet(M) gene. The broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 17 oxytetracycline-resistant GBS isolates, and then minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of these isolates were evaluated. Oxytetracyline-resistant isolates were found to be susceptible to ampicillin, lincomycin, norfloxacin, erythromycin and chloramphenicol, with the MIC and MBC ranging from </= 0.125 to 0.5 mug ml- 1 and </= 0.125 to 2 mug ml- 1, respectively. Moreover, all 17 oxytetracycline-resistant isolates demonstrated resistance to trimethoprim, oxolinic acid, gentamicin, sulfamethoxazole and oxytetracycline, with the MIC and MBC ranging from 16 to >/= 128 mug ml- 1 and >/= 128 mug ml- 1, respectively. These findings are useful information for antibiotic usage in fish aquaculture.
