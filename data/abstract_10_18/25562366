Listeria monocytogenes, a Gram-positive opportunistic food-borne pathogen, naturally resistant to many antibiotics and acquired resistance may be a concern in the nearer future. Hence, there is a scope for screening of novel therapeutic agents and drug targets, toward the treatment of fatal listeria infections. The SecA homologs, SecA1 and SecA2 are the essential components of the general secretion (Sec) pathway, a specialised protein export system, present in L. monocytogenes. This study evaluates the use of botanicals against L. monocytogenes MTCC 1143 by considering SecA proteins as probable drug targets by high-throughput screening approaches. The 3D structure of SecA proteins with good stereochemical validity was generated by comparative modelling. The druglikeness and pharmacokinetic properties of 97 phytoligands identified through the extensive literature survey were predicted for druglikeness and ADMET properties. The inhibitory properties of best candidates were studied by molecular docking. The effect of the selected candidate molecules were further analysed in vitro well diffusion and cell aggregation assays. The antibiotic sensitivity profiling applied to L. monocytogenes MTCC 1143 using clinically relevant antibiotics showed that the bacteria became drug resistant to many tested antibiotics. The virtual screening suggested that .05 M cinnamic aldehyde from Cinnamomum camphora and 1, 2-Epoxycyclododecane from Cassia auriculata were identified as potential SecA inhibitors. The well diffusion assays suggested that the selected herbal substances have antibacterial activities. Further, preliminary validation suggested that incorporation of cinnamic aldehyde and methanolic or ethyl acetate extract of C. auriculata in broth medium shows growth reduction, misassembly and cell aggregation. This indicates the inhibition of SecA targets.
