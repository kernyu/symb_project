The development of artemisinin resistance in the Greater Mekong Subregion poses a significant threat to malaria elimination. Artemisinin-based combination therapies including artemether-lumefantrine (AL) are recommended by WHO as first-line treatment for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. This article provides a comprehensive review of the existing and latest data as a basis for interpretation of observed variability in parasite sensitivity to AL over the last 5 years. Clinical efficacy and preclinical data from a range of endemic countries are summarized, including potential molecular markers of resistance. Overall, AL remains effective in the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in most regions. Establishing validated molecular markers for resistance and strict efficacy monitoring will reinforce timely updates of treatment policies.
