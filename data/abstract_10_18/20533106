BACKGROUND/AIMS: Because of the increasing resistance to clarithromycin and metronidazole, the most frequently used antibiotics in the first-line therapy of Helicobacter pylori eradication, new therapeutic alternatives are needed. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of 7- and 14-day triple therapy including lansoprazole, levofloxacin and amoxicillin for Helicobacter pylori eradication as a first-line therapy. METHODS: Ninety-one non-ulcer dyspeptic patients infected with Helicobacter pylori as diagnosed by both histology and a rapid urease test were included in this study. Patients were randomized to receive either 7- (Group 1; 51 patients) or 14-day (Group 2; 40 patients) therapy with lansoprazole (30 mg b.i.d.), plus levofloxacin (500 mg o.i.d.) and amoxicillin (1000 mg b.i.d.) and they were followed for six weeks. Eradication was assessed by 14C-urea breath test four weeks after completing the treatment protocols. RESULTS: In Group 1, 41 patients completed the treatment and the eradication rate was 34.15%. In group 2, 36 patients completed the treatment and the eradication rate was 72.2% (p= 0.001 vs group 1). CONCLUSIONS: Triple therapy with lansoprazole, levofloxacin and amoxicillin for 14 days was effective for Helicobacter pylori eradication, but 7-day therapy with the same protocol had a lower and unacceptable cure rate and should not be used.
