We expressed the wild-type rplC and mutated rplC (Cys154Arg) genes, respectively, in Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra and H37Rv in an attempt to delineate the role of rplC (Cys154Arg) regarding oxazolidinone resistance. An increase of the MICs of linezolid (LZD) and sutezolid (PNU-100480, PNU) against the recombinant mycobacteria with overexpressed rplC mutation (Cys154Arg) was found, suggesting the rplC gene is a determinant of bacillary susceptibilities to LZD and PNU.
