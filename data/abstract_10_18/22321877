OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical factors, drug resistance and molecular epidemiology homologous characteristics of pan-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (PDRAB) in acquired infections and analyze the correlation factor between epidemic characteristics and acquired infections. METHODS: A total of 60 PDRAB strains from nine acquired infections and related clinic data were collected from January 2009 to January 2011. The drug-resistant phenotype was tested by disk diffusion methods. The isolate identification and homology were studied by automation repetitive-element sequence-based (REP)-PCR typing platform from genes and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-TOF MS) from proteins. RESULTS: All strains were resistant to 12 antibiotics except 2 strains to imipenem and meropenem. The strains in this study were divided into 12 types (A-L) by REP-PCR. And 60 strains were also clustered to a-e types by MALDI-TOF-TOF MS. Compared with MALDI-TOF-TOF MS, REP-PCR tended to be more accurate. Breathing machine carriage and cross transmission were the main reasons for a major epidemic outbreak at department of pulmonary medicine from July 2009 to October 2009. Hand transmission of medical care personnel was a key factor for SICU 2010 January to February. The contamination and transmission to environment of PDRAB in nasal pharynx or respiratory tract by superspreader were the main reasons for the other 7 epidemic outbreaks. Department of emergency medicine was the source of acquired infections. CONCLUSION: The key control measures of acquired infections are early identification and isolation of spreader, environment and instrument disinfection, hand washing and rational uses of antibiotics. MALDI-TOF-TOF MS will become a preferred tool of identification and classification of microorganisms because of its simple operation, affordable price and handling rapidity.
