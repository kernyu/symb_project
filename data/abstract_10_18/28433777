The efficacy of current influenza vaccines and small molecule antiviral drugs is curtailed by the emerging of multidrug-resistant influenza viruses. As resistance to the only FDA-approved oral influenza antiviral, oseltamivir (Tamiflu), continues to rise, there is a clear need to develop the next-generation of antiviral drugs. Since more than 95% of current circulating influenza A viruses carry the S31N mutation in their M2 genes, the AM2-S31N mutant proton channel represents an attractive target for the development of broad-spectrum antivirals. In this study we report the design and synthesis of the first class of organosilanes that have potent antiviral activity against a panel of human clinical isolates of influenza A viruses, including viruses that are resistant to amantadine, oseltamivir, or both.
