The drugs against tropical neglected diseases, especially Chagas' Disease, were launched more than 30 years ago, and the development of resistance requires the discovery of new and more effective chemotherapeutic agents. Trypanosoma cruzi has a redox enzyme called trypanothione reductase which was successfully inhibited for peptide derivatives (McKie et al., Amino Acids, 2001, 20: 145). This work aims at studying the mechanism of inhibition of this enzyme through molecular dynamics simulations and evaluating the behavior of some derivatives when inhibiting this protein. We should affirm that any particular molecular dynamics analysis tools (Hbond pattern, 3-D root-mean-square deviation, solvent accessible surface area, etc.) cannot be used apart from the others to justify completely these peptides inhibitory patterns. Based on our results, we reproduced the experimental data and, moreover, we discriminated against a new site in enzyme aperture, which can assist the development of powerful inhibitors against trypanothione reductase enzyme.
