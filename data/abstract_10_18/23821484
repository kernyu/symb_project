PURPOSE: Urinary tract infections (UTIs), the most common serious bacterial infections in children, are frequently caused by Escherichia coli. The purpose of this study was to investigate E. coli resistance/multidrug resistance to antibiotics most frequently used for UTIs. METHODS: Children 0-18 years of age, hospitalized at the University Pediatric Hospital in Novi Sad, Serbia, were included in a 1-year observational prospective study. The microbiological analysis was performed using the standard Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. The results were analyzed using WHONET 5.4 software. RESULTS: E. coli was isolated from 61.7 % of positive urine specimens. In general, higher average E. coli antibiotic resistance was found in infants and toddlers compared to children and adolescents (33.4 vs. 25.0 %) (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, it was observed that the average resistance to all the tested antibiotics was higher in boys than in girls (37.0 vs. 25.1 %) (p < 0.0001). E. coli was highly susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam (>93.1 %), amikacin (86.3 %), quinolones (>75.0 %), and penems (>96.6 %). The prevalence of multiresistant E. coli strains was significantly higher in infants and toddlers (72.3 vs. 36.8 %) (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: E. coli, a common cause of UTIs in children admitted to pediatric hospitals, is highly resistant/multidrug-resistant to commonly used antibiotics. Higher average resistance is found in infants and toddlers than in children and adolescents, as well as in boys compared to girls. These findings are important for the regional empiric therapy of UTIs and call for actions to decrease E. coli antibiotic resistance.
