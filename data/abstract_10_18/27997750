AIMS: This study focuses on the bactericidal mechanism of the new combination of disinfectant glutaraldehyde-didecyldimethylammonium bromide (GA-DDAB) against Escherichia coli. METHODS AND RESULTS: Escherichia coli were exposed to GA-DDAB, and assays for cell morphology, K(+) and Ca(2+) leakage, H(+) -ATPase activity and DNA degradation were performed. GA-DDAB damaged the cell wall and disrupted cell-membrane integrity. Leakage of K(+) and Ca(2+) increased, resulting in significantly lower intracellular concentrations within 60 min of treatment. In addition, H(+) -ATPase was inactivated and DNA was degraded. CONCLUSIONS: Leakage of intracellular components indicated that GA-DDAB damaged the cell membrane of E. coli. This may have caused the observed disruption in equilibria of metal ions, inactivation of H(+) -ATPase, and DNA damage. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Using a low concentration of GA and DDAB, a new combination disinfectant was developed. GA-DDAB displayed higher antimicrobial activity than treatment with GA or DDAB alone. Therefore, GA-DDAB may be a more cost-effective and efficient antimicrobial agent than others in use today. Furthermore, this study provided a paradigm for developing high-efficiency disinfectant to help address the growing problem of bacterial resistance.
