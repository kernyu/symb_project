Two cases of insidious bacteremia by uncommon curve and spiral-shaped, motile anaerobic gram-negative rods are presented. Both of them were of an unclear origin and occurred in immunosuppressed patients with simultaneous diseases. The key tests for the identification of Anaerobiospirillum were its micromorphology, a strictly anaerobic condition, negative catalase activity, the special-potency disk profile, glucose fermentation, and beta-NAG production. Desulfovibrio species was identified by all the above preliminary tests but with a different disk profile, as well as for being asaccharolytic and desulfoviridin and H2S producer. We here alert about the resistance or intermediate susceptibility of Anaerobiospirillum succiniciproducens against antimicrobial agents, such as metronidazole, one of the first-line drugs used for the treatment of anaerobic gram-negative infections. Aminopenicillins with beta-lactamase-inhibitor combinations and imipenem were active for this agent. Desulfovibrio desulfuricans was beta-lactamase producer and resistant to cephalosporins, while metronidazole, imipenem and levofloxacin were active. A reliable identification of these microorganisms is important for establishing the best therapeutic scheme.
