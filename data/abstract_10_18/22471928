Enterococci are Gram-positive, facultative anaerobic cocci. They are found in many environments (including milk and dairy products, vegetables, plants, cereals, and meats). Enterococci are considered commensal organisms, but can also be opportunistic pathogens associated with morbidity and mortality of humans and animals. A longitudinal study of antibiotic resistance of Enterococcus to ampicillin, erythromycin, and tetracycline was conducted on an academic teaching farm. Environmental samples were collected by drag swabs at select locations prior to and after the introduction of livestock. All samples were initially processed and screened with specialized media, and then replica plated on tryptic soy agar containing a predetermined amount of antibiotic. There was some variation in the quantity of bacterial and antibiotic-resistant colonies; however, resistance to tetracycline was extremely high. The increases of too numerous to count populations were not time-dependent and appeared consistently after the placement of cows. There is little information on the prevalence and epidemiology of antibiotic resistance of Enterococci outside of the hospital setting, including on dairy farms. Longitudinal studies are important in providing insight into the dynamics of establishment and proliferation of bacteria and of antibiotic resistance.
