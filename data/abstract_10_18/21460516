In an effort to improve the selection of appropriate empiric gram-negative therapy for pneumonia, we examined intensive care unit-specific combination antibiograms. These antibiograms were able to predict appropriate empiric gram-negative therapy. Empiric combination therapy based on unit-specific combination antibiograms may aid in the selection of therapy for gram-negative pneumonia.
