We describe the development of resistance in an Aspergillus fumigatus strain, originally sensitive to itraconazole and voriconazole, recovered from a case of pulmonary aspergilloma treated with voriconazole. A G448S mutation on the cyp51A gene was detected by sequencing. Frequent culture and in vitro antifungal susceptibility testing is suggested for early detection of the development of multi-azole resistance in patients on long-term therapy for A. fumigatus infections.
