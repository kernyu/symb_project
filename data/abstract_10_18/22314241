Leishmaniases are tropical and sub-tropical diseases for which classical drugs (i.e. antimonials) exhibit toxicity and drug resistance. Such a situation requires to find new chemical series with antileishmanial activity. This work consists in analyzing the structure of a validated target in Leishmania: the GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase (GDP-MP), an enzyme involved in glycosylation and essential for amastigote survival. By comparing both human and L. infantum GDP-MP 3D homology models, we identified (i) a common motif of amino acids that binds to the mannose moiety of the substrate and, interestingly, (ii) a motif that is specific to the catalytic site of the parasite enzyme. This motif could then be used to design compounds that specifically inhibit the leishmanial GDP-MP, without any effect on the human homolog.
