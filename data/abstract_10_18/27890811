BACKGROUND: Enteric fever's incidence is decreasing among residents of high-income countries, although it's rising in travelers coming from low-resource endemic settings. The study's aim is to describe epidemiological, clinical and laboratory features of patients with enteric fever. METHODS: Retrospective descriptive study of enteric fever cases diagnosed at a Tropical Medicine Unit in Barcelona, 1993-2012. RESULTS: Out of 40 patients, 31(77,5%) were returning travelers, and 70% of them had been in Southern Asia. In the rest of patients without an antecedent of a recent travel, the infection occurred mainly before year 2000. The more frequently reported symptoms were fever and diarrhea, lacking significant differences between S. typhi and S. paratyphi infections. Quinolones were used as empiric treatment in 47.2% of patients, 36.1% received 3rd generation cephalosporins, 2.78% azithromycin and 13.89% other combinations. Resistance to quinolones in the S. paratyphi group (66.7%) was significantly higher compared with the S. typhi group (20%) (p:0.02). 22.5% of patients had treatment failure and 23.6% patients presented complications, none of them had been previously vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of enteric fever was more frequent among travelers coming from Southern-East Asia. Quinolone resistance is widely spread, particularly in S. paratyphi serotypes and should not be considered as first choice treatment anymore.
