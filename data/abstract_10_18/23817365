The incidence of superficial dermatophytoses is high in developed countries, and there remains a need for effective topical antifungals. In this study, we evaluated the in vitro antifungal activity of naftifine hydrochloride, the active ingredient in naftifine hydrochloride cream and gel 1% and 2%, against dermatophytes. The MICs and minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) of naftifine hydrochloride against 350 clinical strains, including Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, Epidermophyton floccosum, and Microsporum canis, were determined using the CLSI methodology. Subsets from this test panel were subsequently tested in a time-kill assay at 0.125x, 0.25x, 0.5x, and 1x the MFC for each isolate. CFU counts were performed over a period of 48 h of incubation. Additionally, in order to determine the potential for resistance development, six strains were subjected to 15 serial passages in concentrations higher than the MIC for each strain. MICs were determined following each passage. The MIC range against the dermatophyte isolates tested was 0.015 to 1.0 mug/ml, with naftifine hydrochloride being fungicidal against 85% of the Trichophyton species. The time-kill assay showed dose-dependent activity, with the greatest reduction in the numbers of CFU corresponding to the highest drug concentration. There was no increase in MIC for any strains following repeated exposure to naftifine hydrochloride. Naftifine hydrochloride demonstrated potent activity against all dermatophytes tested, and none of the isolates within this test panel demonstrated the potential for the development of resistance. Thus, future clinical studies of naftifine hydrochloride against dermatophytes may be warranted for the treatment of superficial dermatophytoses.
