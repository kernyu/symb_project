BACKGROUND: Enterococcus faecalis has been found to be one of the most predominant bacterial species associated with failed endodontic cases. The ability of this microbe to form biofilms; penetrate into dentinal tubules; survival in low pH, high salinity and high temperatures and resistance to many intracanal medicaments, makes it one of the most resistant pathogen of all the root canal flora. Studies have shown that chlorhexidine is relatively more effective against E. faecalis as compared to other intra canal medicaments. But its placement in solution form or gel form up to the root apex is not only difficult but uncertain as well. The purpose of this study was to compare the antimicrobial efficacy of chlorhexidine releasing Activ points chlorhexidine and calcium hydroxide releasing Combi points with that of standard 2% chlorhexidine solution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty McKonkey agar plates were inoculated with Enterococcus faecalis and were divided into three groups. Test specimens (paper points soaked in 2% chlorhexidine solution chlorhexidine releasing Activ points and chlorhexidine and calcium hydroxide releasing Combi points; 20 each) were placed in the plates and the zone of inhibition was measured around the specimen after 24 and 48 hrs. The results so obtained were subjected to statistical analysis. RESULTS: Statistically significant difference was found in terms of zone of inhibition in between the three groups greatest being for Combi points. CONCLUSION: The findings of the present study suggest that Combi points and Activ points can be used safely as an alternative to 2% chlorhexidine solution as intra canal medicament with the additional advantage of availability of these points in ISO standard sizes easy placement up to the root apex and easy retrieval from the root canal system.
