The genetic analysis of high-level mupirocin resistance (Hi-Mup(r)) in a Staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolate from a dog is presented. The Hi-Mup(r) ileS2 gene flanked by a novel rearrangement of directly repeated insertion sequence IS257 elements was located, together with the aminoglycoside resistance aacA-aphD determinant, on a conjugative plasmid related to the pSK41/pGO1 family plasmids.
