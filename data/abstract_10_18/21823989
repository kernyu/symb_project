In 2009, out of the 66 nonrepetitive Enterobacter cloacae collected at Charles Nicolle hospital in Tunisia, 44 were extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers. The aim of the current study was to detect and characterize the genes encoding the ESBLs including blaTEM, blaSHV, and blaCTX-M groups by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis was used to determine the genetic relatedness between isolates. All strains were susceptible to carbapenems. They were resistant to fluoroquinolones, gentamicin, tobramycin, and trimethoprim+sulfamethoxazole but variably resistant to netilmicin, amikacin, and tetracyclines. Sequence analysis of the polymerase chain reaction products revealed the presence of blaCTX-M-15 (39 strains), blaSHV-12 (6 strains), and blaSHV-27 (1 strain). The coexistence of two ESBLs was observed in two isolates harboring, respectively, SHV-12+CTX-M-15 and SHV-27+CTX-M-15. PFGE revealed 36 unrelated profiles. Diffusion of E. cloacae producing CTX-M-15 ESBL in our hospital is the consequence of dissemination of identical or related plasmids harboring the CTX-M-15 gene.
