Urinary tract infections in women are common. Drug resistance among Escherichia coli, the most frequent uropathogen, has increased worldwide. In a prevalence study we investigated the local antibiotic susceptibility of this microorganism in urinary specimens of three laboratories in Zurich. Resistance rates against trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 2010 were 28%, 16% against quinolones and 16% against amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Resistance prevalence for nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin were low with 3,6%, resp. 0,7%. The rate of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli has rapidly increased to 4,3% in 2010. Based on this data and according to the international guidelines for the treatment of uncomplicated cystitis, therapy with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and quinolones are no longer recommended. Nitrofurantoin and Fosfomycin are an appropriate choice. Microbiological testing is advised.
