Helicobacter pylori is an important human pathogen and a gram-negative, spiral shaped and microaerophilic bacteria with persistence colonization in gastric mucosa, causes gastroduodenal inflammation and destruction, resulting in diseases such as duodenal ulcer disease, gastric ulcer disease. When H.pylori discovered by Warren and Marshall, effective therapy developed for this infection and resulted in remarkable change in management of PUD and dyspepsia. Nowadays, the increasing prevalence of drug resistance has complicated successful therapy, considering more attention for appropriate therapy. Ideally, therapy should be based on pretreatment drug susceptibility testing, and empiric use of eradication therapies should assume the presence of antimicrobial drug resistance and use increased doses for 14 days.
