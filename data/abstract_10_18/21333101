SETTING: Western Cape and Eastern Cape Provinces, South Africa. OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential association between the evolution of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and mutations in the inhA promoter or the katG gene. DESIGN: Analysis of the frequency distribution of isoniazid (INH) resistance conferring mutations in a population sample of drug-resistant isolates of M. tuberculosis. RESULTS: In the Western Cape and Eastern Cape Provinces, the percentage of isolates exhibiting inhA promoter mutations increased significantly from respectively 48.4% and 62.4% in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) isolates to 85.5% and 91.9% in XDR isolates. Data from the Western Cape revealed that significantly more XDR-TB isolates showed mutations in the inhA promoter than in katG (85.5% vs. 60.9%, P < 0.01), while the respective proportions were equal for INH-resistant non-MDR-TB isolates ( approximately 30%). CONCLUSIONS: inhA promoter mutations are strongly associated with XDR-TB in South Africa. We suggest that this is due to the dual resistance to ethionamide and (low-dose) INH conferred by inhA promoter mutations. The use of molecular probe assays such as the GenoType(R) MTBDRplus assay, which allows the detection of inhA promoter mutations, could enable treatment regimens to be adjusted depending on the pharmacogenetic properties of the mutations detected.
