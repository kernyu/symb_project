There has been a revolution in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Several oral regimens combining direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) from different families [NS5B nucleotide inhibitors, NS5B non-nucleoside inhibitors, NS5A replication complex inhibitors and NS3/4A protease inhibitors (PI)] are under development. These regimens result in an increase in sustained virological response (SVR) rates to above 90% and reduce the duration of treatment to twelve weeks or less. As of 2015 several regimens will be approved with additive potencies, without cross-resistance and with a good safety profile. Remaining issues will include increasing screening and access to care so that HCV may become the first chronic viral infection eradicated worldwide. This review summarizes results obtained with oral DAAs combinations, that have been approved and/or have completed phase III clinical trials for HCV genotype 1 (HCV-1) treatment-naive patients.
