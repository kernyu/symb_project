BACKGROUND: Some aspects of bacteremic cholangitis are unknown in Chile. AIM: To gather more information on clinical, microbiological aspects as well as risk factors for ICU admission, recurrence and antimicrobial resistance. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective research was performed using medical records of adult patients in a general hospital. RESULTS: Between 2006-2012, 22 patients with 29 bacteremic events were identified. Previous cholangitis events were reported by 27.3%, 45.5% had recent admissions and, 50% had used antimicrobial compounds. Coledocholithiasis was the most common cause of obstruction (45.5%) followed by cancer (36.4%). One third developed shock (31%), the only factor associated with ICU admission (OR 30, p < 0.05). In 24 of the 29 bacteremic events, the biliary tract was intervened (82.8%) and in 80.8% during the first 72 hours. Gram negative bacilli were predominant (> 80%) and some infrequent agents such as Staphylococcus warneri, Shewanella spp. and, Aeromonas spp. were observed. Among enteric gram negative bacilli, 29.2% presented fluoroquinolone resistance and, 26.1% resistance to third generation cephalosporins, both associated with previous endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (OR 35 and 16.5, respectively p < 0.05). A favorable response was observed in 93.1% of bacte-remic events but in 31.8% of patients cholangitis recurred with or without bacteremia. Recurrence was associated to recent admission (OR 16.5, p = 0.01) and in all cases occurred before 81 days. In-hospital mortality was 9.1% (n = 2), but in only one case associated to sepsis. Average length of stay (LOS) was 17.8 days. CONCLUSIONS: Early intervention of the biliary tract allows a favorable response in patients affected by bacteremic cholangitis, but this condition use intensive care resources, had a prolonged LOS, a recurrent pattern, and is associated with several bacterial species, some of them resistant.
