A study has been carried out to determine whether the action of triclabendazole (TCBZ) against the liver fluke, Fasciola hepatica is altered by inhibition of the cytochrome P450 (CYP 450)-mediated drug metabolism pathway. The Oberon TCBZ-resistant and Cullompton TCBZ-susceptible fluke isolates were used for these experiments, the basic design of which is given in the paper by Devine et al. (2010a). Piperonyl butoxide (PB) was the CYP P450 inhibitor used. Morphological changes resulting from drug treatment and following metabolic inhibition were assessed by means of transmission electron microscopy. After treatment with either TCBZ or TCBZ.SO on their own, there was greater disruption to the TCBZ-susceptible than TCBZ-resistant isolate. However, co-incubation with PB+TCBZ, but more particularly PB+TCBZ.SO, led to greater changes to the TCBZ-resistant isolate than with each drug on its own, with blebbing of the apical plasma membrane, severe swelling of the basal infolds and their associated mucopolysaccharide masses in the syncytium and flooding in the internal tissues. Golgi complexes were greatly reduced or absent in the tegumental cells and the synthesis and production of secretory bodies were badly disrupted. The mitochondria were swollen throughout the tegumental system and the somatic muscle blocks were disrupted. With the TCBZ-susceptible Cullompton isolate, there was a limited increase in drug action following co-incubation with PB. The results provide evidence that the condition of a TCBZ-resistant fluke can be altered by inhibition of drug metabolism. Moreover, they support the concept that altered drug metabolism contributes to the mechanism of resistance to TCBZ.
