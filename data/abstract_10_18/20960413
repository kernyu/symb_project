The in vitro activity of 10 cephalosporin antimicrobial agents against 75 isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus pseudintermedius derived from dogs was assessed. The lowest minimal inhibitory concentration for 90% of strains (MIC90) values obtained were for cephalothin, cefovecin, and cefazolin (0.12 ug/mL), followed by ceftiofur and cefoxitin (0.25 ug/mL), cefpodoxime (0.5 ug/mL), and cefaclor and cefadroxil (1 ug/mL). The highest MIC90 values were found for cephalexin and cefixime (2 ug/mL). In this in vitro study, sensitivity to cephalothin was indicative of cephalexin susceptibility, although there were marked differences in MICs. Cephalothin susceptibility was not indicative of susceptibility to all tested cephalosporins, nor was there a clear trend in susceptibility based on cephalosporin generation.
