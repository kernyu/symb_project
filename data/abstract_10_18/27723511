The escalating demand for fipronil by the increasing insects' resistance to synthetic pyrethroids placed a burden on aquatic vertebrates. Although awareness regarding the toxicity of fipronil to fish is arising, the integral alteration caused by fipronil remains unexplored. Here, we investigated on the development toxicity of fipronil and the metabolic physiology perturbation at 120h post fertilization through GC-MS metabolomics on zebrafish embryo. We observed that fipronil dose-dependently induced malformations including uninflated swim bladder and bent spine. Further, the "omic" technique hit 26 differential metabolites after exposure to fipronil and five significant signaling pathways. We speculated that changes in primary bile acid synthesis pathway and the content of saturated fatty acid in the chemical-related group indicated the liver toxicity. Pathway of Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis changed by fipronil may relate to the macromolecular synthesis. Concurrently, methane metabolism pathway was also identified while the role in zebrafish needs further determination. Overall, this study revealed several new signaling pathways in fipronil-treated zebrafish embryo/larval.
