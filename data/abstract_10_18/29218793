BACKGROUND AND AIM: Infection by Helicobacter pylori is implicated in a wide range of upper gastrointestinal diseases. Owing to the rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of H. pylori, the development of novel treatment modalities for antibiotic-resistant H. pylori infection is a key priority. Blue light-emitting diodes (LED) may represent a unique option owing to their antimicrobial effect. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the anti-proliferative effect of blue LED against antibiotic-resistant H. pylori. METHODS: Ten antibiotic-resistant strains and one sensitive H. pylori strain were used in this study. After irradiation by blue LED along time course, the viability of H. pylori was evaluated by enumerating colony forming units. Morphological changes in H. pylori were observed using a scanning electron microscope. Reductase activity was measured as an indicator of bacterial cellular activity. Total reactive oxygen species was monitored using fluorescence intensity and fluorescence microscope imaging. RESULTS: After irradiation by blue LED, the numbers of H. pylori in all the strains were significantly reduced compared with control group. The H. pylori exhibited a short rod-shaped morphology after irradiation; no such change was observed in H. pylori not exposed to blue LED. Re-irradiation of surviving strain after the initial irradiation also exhibited the same anti-proliferation effect. After blue LED irradiation, bacterial cellular activity was lower, and total reactive oxygen species production was significantly higher in blue LED group, compared with that in control. CONCLUSIONS: Blue LED could be a new treatment to eradicate infection with antibiotic-resistant H. pylori.
