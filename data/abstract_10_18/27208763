Antimicrobial resistance is a common iatrogenic complication of modern life and medical care. One of the most demonstrative examples is the exponential increase in the incidence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) production among Enterobacteriaceae, which is the most common human pathogens outside of the hospital settings. Infections resulting from ESBL-producing bacteria are associated with devastating outcomes, now affecting even previously healthy individuals. This development poses an enormous burden and threat to public health. This paper aims to narrate the evolving epidemiology of ESBL infections, and highlight current challenges in terms of management and prevention of these common infections.
