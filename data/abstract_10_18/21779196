Phaeohyphomycosis is a subcutaneous infection caused by dark pigmented fungi, including fungi of the species Phaeoacremonium, Alternaria, Exophiala, and Pyrenochaeta. In August 2005, a 54-yr-old man who had received a renal transplant 5 yr ago was admitted to our hospital with a subcutaneous mass on the third finger of the right hand; the mass had been present for several months. He had been receiving immunosuppressive agents for several years. He underwent excision of the mass, which was followed by aspiration of the wound for bacterial and fungal cultures. Many fungal hyphae were observed on the histology slide treated with periodic acid-Schiff stain. A few white waxy colonies with a woolly texture grew on the Sabouraud dextrose agar at 30 degrees C and changed to dark brown in color. Nucleotide sequencing of internal transcribed spacer regions revealed 100% homology to the Phaeoacremonium aleophilum anamorph and Togninia minima teleomorph (514 bp/514 bp). The patient completely recovered after wide surgical excision. Here, we report the first case of phaeohyphomycosis caused by Phaeoacremonium species in a kidney transplant patient in Korea.
