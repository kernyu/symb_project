Capnocytophga canimorsus and Capnocytophga cynodegmi can be transmitted from cats and dogs to humans, and can cause a wide range of infections including wound infections, sepsis, or endocarditis. We and others recently discovered two new Capnocytophaga species, C. canis and C. stomatis, mainly associated with wound infections. The first-line treatment of animal bite related infections is penicillin, and in case of allergy, doxycycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. However, there is a lack of antibiotic susceptibility patterns for animal bite associated Capnocytophaga species. Thus, we set out to study the antibiotic profiles against animal bite associated Capnocytophaga species isolated from wound and blood cultures after cat and dog bites and coupled the findings to whole genome sequencing data. A total of 24 strains were included in the study. Phenotypic analysis of antibiotic resistance was performed with E-tests. The web-based tool 'Resfinder' was used to identify resistance genes in the whole genome dataset. Two strains of C. cynodegmi and two strains of the recently discovered C. stomatis were resistant to penicillin (MIC > 24 mg/L) and cephalosporins (MIC > 24 mg/L), and three out of these strains also exhibited resistance to imipenem (MIC = 32 mg/L). Genomic analysis revealed that these strains carried a class D beta-lactamase gene, which has not previously been found in Capnocytophaga spp. A class D beta lactamase with broad substrate specificity was found in animal bite associated Capnocytophaga species, which could have important implications when treating wound infections after cat and dog bites. It also suggests that pet animal bacteria can harbour resistance genes with relevance for human infections.
