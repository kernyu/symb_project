We report on a case of severe cutaneous reaction to darunavir/r and a successful desensitization protocol. The patient was a 41-yr old female. known to be HIV infective for 18 years and who had received several drug regiments in the past. As a consequence, her virus had triple-class mutations but was susceptible to darunavir/r. Her CD4 was 200 cells/mm(3) and HIV viral load 56,000 copies/mL. Eight days after initiation of darunavir/r the patient developed a severe pruritic vesicular extended cutaneous allergic reaction which required cessation of all drugs. Due to the severity of the allergic reaction no rechallenge was done. After the patient's recovery, the virus was found to be susceptible only to maraviroc, raltegravir, and darunavir/r. Since darunavir/r was an essential component in treating this triple-class mutated virus, a desensitization protocol was applied successfully. Six months after desensitization protocol was applied successfully. Six months after desensitization, the patient is asymptomatic, compliant, and her HIV viral load remains at <20 copies/mL.
