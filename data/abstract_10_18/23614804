The resistance of foodborne Staphylococcus aureus isolates to antimicrobial agents is an increasing problem. In this study, 154 S. aureus food isolates were examined on the basis of inducible clindamycin resistance and the presence of ermABC genes. Furthermore, the genetic relatedness of S. aureus strains having inducible and constitutive clindamycin resistance was investigated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Inducible clindamycin resistance was determined in five strains using the D-test. Only S. aureus strain HE7A showed constitutive resistance. Polymerase chain reaction results demonstrated that all constitutive and inducible clindamycin resistant strains contained only the ermC gene. However, the presence of the ermC gene was also detected in three strains without inducible or constitutive resistance. Nucleotide variations on the sequences of ermC genes were also determined. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis of two groups of S. aureus strains (S4BY, PY62A, PY38BY/S and S35A, S35B) with inducible resistance demonstrated 100% homology, but the other susceptible and ermC gene carrying S. aureus strains showed different band patterns with 44-88% homology. This is the first study reporting inducible clindamycin resistance in foodborne S. aureus isolates in Turkey.
