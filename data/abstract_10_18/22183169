Oritavancin exhibited potent activity against vancomycin-susceptible (MIC(50) and MIC(90), 0.015/0.03 mug/ml) and vanB-carrying E. faecalis isolates (MIC(50) and MIC(90), 0.015 and 0.015 mug/ml). Higher (16- to 32-fold) MIC(50)s and MIC(90)s for vanA-harboring E. faecalis were noted (MIC(50) and MIC(90), 0.25 and 0.5 mug/ml), although oritavancin inhibited all strains at </= 0.5 mug/ml. Vancomycin-susceptible and vanB-carrying E. faecium strains (MIC(50) and MIC(90), </= 0.008 and </= 0.008 mug/ml for both) were very susceptible to oritavancin, as were VanA-producing isolates (MIC(50) and MIC(90), 0.03 and 0.06 mug/ml). Oritavancin exhibited good in vitro potency against this collection of organisms, including vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
