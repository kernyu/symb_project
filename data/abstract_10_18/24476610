Mycoplasma genitalium is considered the smallest self-replicating cell. It was first isolated in 1981, from 2 of 13 men with urethritis. Mycoplasma genitalium causes urethritis, cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory disease. Because of difficulties in cultivation, the diagnosis is based exclusively on PCR methodology. The recommended therapy for Mycoplasma genitalium infections is azithromycin or doxycycline. Development of macrolide resistance was shown to correlate with treatment failure.
