We report the emergence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in Austria. Over a 10-year period, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates were obtained from 13 hospitalized patients, with the first isolation in the year 2005 and a remarkable increase in the number of involved patients in 2010. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae comprise eight Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, four Klebsiella oxytoca isolates, and one Escherichia coli isolate. The detected carbapenemases were the metallo-beta-lactamases New Delhi beta-lactamase, VIM and IMP, and the serin-beta-lactamase Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase.
