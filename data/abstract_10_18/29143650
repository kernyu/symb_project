BACKGROUND: Emerging resistance of heartworms (Dirofilaria immitis) to macrocyclic lactone (ML) preventives is an increasing concern for veterinarians, pet owners and animal health companies that supply heartworm preventives, with recent reports of resistant isolates identified from the Mississippi Delta region of the United States. Products that are effective in eliminating microfilariae (MF) in dogs harboring resistant heartworm infections could be important in reducing the spread of heartworm resistance. The current study was conducted to investigate the potential for ProHeart(R) 6 (PH 6; Zoetis) and ProHeart(R) SR-12 (PH 12; Zoetis) to reduce MF in dogs experimentally inoculated with an isolate of D. immitis (ZoeMo-2012) confirmed to be resistant to MLs. METHODS: Twenty-three dogs with preexisting heartworm infections (via surgical transplantation) were randomly allocated to four groups based on pretreatment (Day -14) MF counts. On Day 0, dogs received a subcutaneous injection of either saline (placebo-treated control, 6 dogs), PH 6 (0.17 mg/kg, 6 dogs), PH 12 (0.5 mg/kg, 5 dogs) or a single oral dose of moxidectin powder in a gelatin capsule (0.25 mg/kg, 6 dogs). All dogs were bled for MF counts (modified Knott's test) on Days 0 (pretreatment), 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, 56, and 84. Dogs in control and PH 6 groups were also bled for MF counts on Days 112, 140, and 168. No adverse events associated with treatment were observed for any dog. RESULTS: Average reductions in MF counts compared with controls for PH 6 were 9.7% on Day 1, increasing to 75.0% on Day 7, and further to 86.5% on Day 28. On Day 42, average MF reduction increased to 90.3%. Reductions increased further over the next several months with reductions of 91.3, 96.8, 96.6, and 98.9% on Days 56, 84, 112, and 140, respectively. On Day 168, the reduction was 99.3% (P < 0.0001). Average reductions in MF counts compared with controls for PH 12 were 20.9% on Day 1, increasing to 78.9% on Day 7, and further to 91.2% on Day 28. On Day 84, the reduction was 96.9%. For dogs receiving a single oral moxidectin (0.25 mg/kg) on Day 0, reductions in MF were 86.3% on Day 1 and fluctuated between 74.4 and 83.6% through Day 28. On Days 42 and 56, percentage reductions were 87.1 and 81.8%, respectively, and 92.6% at the final time point (Day 84). CONCLUSION: Both PH 6 and PH 12 were highly effective in reducing the MF levels of a confirmed ML-resistant heartworm isolate following a single dose.
