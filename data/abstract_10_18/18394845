The spread of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has been reported in communities worldwide. In this study, we characterized 64 Tunisian CA-MRSA by agr typing, polymerase chain reaction assay for 20 virulence genes, staphylococcal chromosomal cassette mec (SCCmec) typing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and protein A gene (spa) typing. All our isolates were lukS-PV-lukF-PV positive, etd positive, and edin positive. They harbored SCCmec type IV and belonged to agr group 3. PFGE typing showed that our isolates were distributed in 11 different pulsotypes. spa typing and MLST, performed with isolates representative of each PFGE pattern, revealed that all isolates had a unique spa type (t044) and a common sequence type (ST80). The isolates showed susceptibility to the majority of antibiotics, and resistance to kanamycin, erythromycin, and tetracycline, but intermediate resistance to fusidic acid. Full analysis of our results revealed that our isolates were nonmultiresistant and belonged to a single clonal type ST80.
