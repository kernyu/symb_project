Detailed annotation of an IncHI2 plasmid, pSTM6-275, from Salmonella enterica serotype 1,4,5,12:i:- TW-Stm6 revealed a composite structure including antimicrobial resistance genes on mobile genetic elements. The plasmid was thermosensitive for transfer to E.coli and conferred reduced susceptibility to antibiotics, copper sulphate and silver nitrate. Metal ion susceptibility was dependent on physiological conditions, giving an insight into the environments where this trait might confer a fitness advantage.
