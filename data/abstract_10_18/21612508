Streptococcus pyogenes or group A Streptococcus, a major human pathogen, remains susceptible to beta-lactams, but resistance to other antibiotics is becoming more common. The purpose of this study was to characterize both phenotypic and genotypic epidemiological markers of group A Streptococcus and to identify the mechanisms of resistance to macrolides and tetracyclines. A total of 103 strains, isolated at Charles Nicolle University Hospital of Tunis, were investigated. The rate of resistance to erythromycin was low (5%), whereas a high rate of tetracycline resistance was found (70%). All the macrolide-resistant isolates expressed the constitutive macrolide, lincosamide, and streptograminB phenotype and harbored the erm(B) gene. Resistance to tetracycline was mainly due to the tet(M) gene, which is commonly associated with the conjugative transposon Tn916. No significant association was found between erm(B) and tet(M) genes. The tetracycline-resistant strains belonged to 28 distinct emm types. Among them, emm118 was the most prevalent type, followed by emm42, std432, emm76, and emm18. However, emm1, emm4, emm6, emm28, and emm3 were the most frequent types among tetracycline susceptible isolates. Only emm118 and emm42 types (p </= 0.05) were significantly associated with resistance to tetracycline.
