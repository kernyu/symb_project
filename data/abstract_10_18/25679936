INTRODUCTION: Since initial antibiotic treatment in patients with urinary tract infection (UTI) is empiric, is very important to know the local epidemiology to make the correct therapeutical decisions. OBJECTIVE: Determinate local features of antimicrobial resistance in pediatric patients with UTI. METHOD: Retrospective review of urine culture tests of children under 15 years old, obtained in a pediatric emergency department in Valdivia, between february and december 2012. RESULTS: Escherichia coli showed high percentage of resistance to ampicillin (44,8%) and first generation cephalosporin (36%). DISCUSSION: A well understanding of local antimicrobial resistance profile is useful to a correct empiric treatment.
