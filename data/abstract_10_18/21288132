Yersinia enterocolitica and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis strains isolated from wild boars and fattening pigs were characterized and compared with each other. In wild boars, ail-positive Y. enterocolitica strains belonged to bioserotypes 4/O:3 (36%, 5/14), 2/O:9 (29%, 4/14), and 2/O:5,27 (21%, 3/14). Additionally, two ail-positive strains were untypable. Among fattening pigs, the bioserotype 4/O:3 was dominating (91%, 71/78), and bioserotypes 2/O:5,27 (8%, 6/78) and 2/O:9 (1%, 1/78) were rare. inv-positive Y. pseudotuberculosis strains of serotypes O:1 and O:2 were isolated only from wild boars. Antimicrobial resistance patterns between wild boar and fattening pig strains differed. Most of the ail-positive Y. enterocolitica strains carried yst, hreP, and virF genes. Several genotypes of Y. enterocolitica strains were obtained by PFGE using NotI, ApaI, XhoI, and SpeI enzymes. All genotypes of wild boar strains differed from fattening pig strains. Especially strains of bioserotype 4/O:3 were clearly different with all four enzymes. These results show that wild boar strains differed from domestic pig strains. More wild boar strains should be isolated to show that wild boars and domestic pigs are reservoirs for different Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis strains.
