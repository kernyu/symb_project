Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is a highly invasive and intractable T-cell malignancy caused by human T-cell leukemia virus-1 infection. We demonstrate herein that normal tissue-derived epithelial cells (NECs) exert protective effects on the survival of leukemic cells, which may partially account for high resistance to antileukemic therapies in patients with ATL. Viral gene-silenced, ATL-derived cell lines (ATL cells) dramatically escaped from histone deacetylase inhibitor-induced apoptosis by direct co-culture with NECs. Adhesions to NECs suppressed p21(Cip1) expression and increased a proportion of resting G0/G1 phase cells in trichostatin A (TSA)-treated ATL cells. ATL cells adhering to NECs down-regulated CD25 expression and enhanced vimentin expression, suggesting that most ATL cells acquired a quiescent state by cell-cell interactions with NECs. ATL cells adhering to NECs displayed highly elevated expression of the cancer stem cell marker CD44. Blockade of CD44 signaling diminished the NEC-conferred resistance of ATL cells to TSA-induced apoptosis. Co-culture with NECs also suppressed the expression of NKG2D ligands on TSA-treated ATL cells, resulting in decreased natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Combined evidence suggests that interactions with normal epithelial cells augment the resistance of ATL cells to TSA-induced apoptosis and facilitate immune evasion by ATL cells.
