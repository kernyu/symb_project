AIMS: Commercially available selective media for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were tested for the detection and isolation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP). METHODS AND RESULTS: Five different screening agars [mannitol salt agar with oxacillin and BD BBL Chromagar MRSA (BD Diagnostics); chromID MRSA agar (bioMerieux); Oxacillin resistance screening agar base (ORSAB); and Brilliance MRSA agar (Oxoid)] were analysed for the detection of MRSP. Bacteria that may be isolated together with MRSP and may grow on the screening agars were included in the study to determine possible interference with the growth of MRSP. MRSP grew well on all selective media except on BD BBL Chromagar MRSA (BD Diagnostics) and chromID MRSA agar (bioMerieux), on which a low to moderate growth rate was noted. CONCLUSIONS: ORSAB (Oxoid) and Brilliance MRSA agar (Oxoid) are most suitable for the detection and isolation of MRSP from clinical material. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The importance of MRSP in veterinary medicine is increasing. Diagnostic systems are needed to detect MRSP carrier as soon as possible. This study provides information about selected MRSA screening agars for the detection of MRSP to the clinical microbiologists.
