PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Healthcare personnel are at risk for occupational exposures to bloodborne pathogens. Primary prevention remains the first line of defense, but secondary prevention measures known to be effective should be implemented when percutaneous exposures occur. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major infectious cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality. Chronic HCV treatment has changed dramatically, with many all-oral directly acting anti-HCV antiviral (DAA) regimens now available. Evidence for the use of DAAs as postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) after occupational exposures to HCV is summarized here. RECENT FINDINGS: Little new evidence supports the use of antivirals in acute HCV infection. Several preliminary studies have examined the use of DAAs or host target agents in chronic HCV treatment. Effective HCV PEP requirements likely include pan-genotypic activity and a high barrier to resistance. One investigational DAA has shown promising results as an efficacious option for all genotypes in chronic HCV treatment and may ultimately represent a potential HCV PEP agent. SUMMARY: Insufficient supporting data exist to endorse the use of DAAs for PEP after HCV occupational exposures; additional studies examining efficacy, duration, and cost-effectiveness are needed. Development of more oral drugs possessing a high barrier of resistance and equal activity against all HCV genotypes is anticipated.
