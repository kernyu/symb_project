Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. Tumor cells exploit various signaling pathways to promote their growth and metastasis. To our knowledge, the role of angiopoietin-like 4 protein (ANGPTL4) in cancer remains undefined. Here, we found that elevated ANGPTL4 expression is widespread in tumors, and its suppression impairs tumor growth associated with enhanced apoptosis. Tumor-derived ANGPTL4 interacts with integrins to stimulate NADPH oxidase-dependent production of O(2)(-). A high ratio of O(2)(-):H(2)O(2) oxidizes/activates Src, triggering the PI3K/PKBalpha and ERK prosurvival pathways to confer anoikis resistance, thus promoting tumor growth. ANGPTL4 deficiency results in diminished O(2)(-) production and a reduced O(2)(-):H(2)O(2) ratio, creating a cellular environment conducive to apoptosis. ANGPTL4 is an important redox player in cancer and a potential therapeutic target.
