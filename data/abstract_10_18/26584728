BACKGROUND: Surgical site infections (SSI) are nosocomial infections that cause considerable problems in orthopaedic surgery. Antibiotic prophylaxis can be used to reduce the risk for SSI. There is no universal antibiotic that can be recommended for prophylaxis in terms of coverage of all possible pathogens because of antibiotic resistance, and there are no universal recommendations for different types of patients in terms of injury type, selected operation and risk factors for development of SSI. The aim of this study was to analyse the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis in surgical treatment (ORIF) of closed lower limb fractures in young, healthy patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patient details were collected from the patient histories. Inclusion criteria for participants were age 20-30 years, not suffering from any type of chronic disease or state that may affect postoperative infection and ISS</=9. Antibiotic prophylaxis use and outcome (SSI) were compared between two groups of patients. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, Fisher's exact test and t-test for proportions. RESULTS: A total of 347 patients with closed lower limb fractures treated with ORIF met the inclusion criteria. There were 290 male and 57 female patients, with an average age of 24.47 years. Prophylactic antibiotics were given to 242 patients (69.74%); 2g ceftriaxone was administered to 88.02% of the patients who received antibiotic prophylaxis. Ten patients developed postoperative infection (eight out of 242 with antibiotic prophylaxis and two out of 105 without antibiotic prophylaxis). The difference between the two groups was not statistically significant (Fisher's exact test, P=0.749). CONCLUSION: Antibiotic prophylaxis was ineffective in preventing SSI in patients with no risk factors for SSI who were undergoing ORIF for closed lower limb fractures.
