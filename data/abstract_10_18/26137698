OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of ethyl acetate extract of Huanglian Jiedu decoction (EAHD) , alone and in combination with fluconazole (FLZ) on FLZ-resistant Candida albicans. METHOD: The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and sessile MIC80 (SMIC80) of EAHD and FLZ to FLZ-resistant C. albicans were determined by CLSI M27-A3 microdilution method, and the synergy of EAHD combined with FLZ were examined by the checkerboard microdilution assay. Agar plate-method was adopted to observe the rate of antifungal activity according to time-kill curve. HPLC and qRT-PCR were utilized to evaluate the changes of ergosterol content and expressions of related genes, respectively. RESULT: MICs of EAHD ranged from 156 to 1,250 mg . L(-1), those of FLZ from 256 to above 2,048 mg . L(-1) with FICI approximate 0.066 in combination; SMIC80 of EAHD were higher than 1,250 mg . L(-1), SMIC80 of FLZ were higher than 512 mg . L(-1) and up to above 2,048 mg . L(-1). Combination group also showed synergy effect except one group showing addition effect. The results of T-K experiment also confirmed obviously fungicidal effect when treated for 12 h. When compared with control groups, the ergosterol was reduced 85% and 50% in the treatments of combination and EAHD alone by HPLC, respective- ly. The expressions of ERG1, ERG2, ERG6, ERG7 and ERG11 were upregulated, and ACS1, ACS2, MET6 were downregulated when exposed to FLZ. The expressions of the above genes were downregulated by treatment of EAHD. The expressions of ERG2, ERG6, ERG11 were upregulated, while ERG1, ERG7, ACS1, ACS2, MET6 were downregulated in combination group. CONCLUSION: The combination of EAHD and FLZ exhibited synergy against FLZ-resistant C. albicans through decreasing the synthesis of ergosterol, and resulting in the breakage of cell membrane.
