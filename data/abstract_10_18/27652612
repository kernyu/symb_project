BACKGROUND: Microbial communities encased in exopolymeric substances (EPS) attached to suitable substrate as biofilms show heightened resistance to multiple drugs including antibiotics. One promising control strategy in dealing with the ever mounting problem of antibiotic resistance amongst biofilm forming bacterial pathogens is the use of biological agents. OBJECTIVE: This review focuses on the development of bacteriophages as means of disrupting biofilm forming pathogens and hence mitigation of multiple drug resistant organisms. RESULTS: Bacteriophages are obligatory viral intracellular parasites that can cause lytic infection of their bacterial hosts. Bacteriophage (Phage) therapy is advantageous in being highly host specific, safe and non-toxic to humans and hence environmental friendly. Bacteriophage induced lysis of cells within the biofilm is aided by the production of penetrating enzymes such as endolysins and EPS depolymerases as well quorum sensing inhibitors such as lactonases. CONCLUSION: Phages are a promising alternative therapy for the control of multiple drug resistant (MDR) pathogens. Several phage (indigenous and engineered)/ phage products are currently being patented and developed as commercial biological control agents.
