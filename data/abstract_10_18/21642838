Methyl jasmonate (MJ) has recently attracted attention as a promising antitumoral compound because of its highly specific proapoptotic properties in a wide range of malignancies. However, the high doses required to achieve a therapeutic benefit have limited its clinical development. Here, we hypothesize that the family of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) may inhibit MJ-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells. We combined MJ with the IAPs inhibitor, the second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (Smac) peptide to treat bladder cancer cells. The results showed that the combination of MJ and Smac peptide enhanced the apoptosis-inducing effect in a synergistic manner by releasing and activating IAPs-bounding caspase-3. These findings suggest that the inhibition of IAPs could overcome the resistance of cancer cells to MJ.
