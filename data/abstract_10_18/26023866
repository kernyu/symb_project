Bax inhibitor 1 (BI-1) is a highly conserved protein originally identified as a suppressor of the proapoptotic protein Bax to inhibit cell death in animals and plants. The orthologs of BI-1 are widely distributed in filamentous fungi but their functions remain largely unknown. Herein, we report the identification and characterizations of MrBI-1, an ortholog of BI-1, in the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium robertsii. First, we found that MrBI-1 could partially rescue mammalian Bax-induced cell death in yeast. Deletion of MrBI-1 impaired fungal development, virulence and heat tolerance in M. robertsii. We also demonstrated that inactivation of MrBI-1 reduced fungal resistance to farnesol but not to hydrogen peroxide, suggesting that MrBI-1 contributes to antiapoptotic-like cell death via the endoplasmic reticulum stress-signaling pathway rather than the classical mitochondrium-dependent pathway. In particular, we found that unlike the observations in yeasts and plants, expression of mammalian Bax did not lead to a lethal effect in M. robertsii; however, it did aggravate the fungal apoptotic effect of farnesol. The results of this study advance our understanding of BI-1-like protein functions in filamentous fungi.
