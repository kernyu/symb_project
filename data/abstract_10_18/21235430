INTRODUCTION: the search for effective inhibitors to multiple infectious agents including influenza, smallpox and hemorrhagic fever viruses is an area of active research as many of these agents pose dramatic health and economic challenges to the human population. Many of these infectious agents are not only endemic threats in different parts of the globe, but are also considered to have the potential of being used as bioterrorism agents. AREAS COVERED: this review focuses on inhibitors that are currently in use in the research community against specific emerging infectious agents and those that have bioterrorism potential. The paper provides information about the availability of FDA approved drugs, whenever applicable, and insights into the specific aspect of the agent life cycle that is affected by drug treatment, when known. EXPERT OPINION: the key message that is conveyed in this review is that a combination of pathogen and host-based inhibitors may have to be used for successful control of viral replication to limit the development of drug resistance.
