The antimicrobial trends over 6 years were studied, and the effect of revised Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) breakpoints (2012) for ciprofloxacin susceptibility reporting in typhoidal Salmonellae was determined. A total of 874 (95.4%) isolates were nalidixic acid-resistant (NAR). Using the CLSI 2011 guidelines (M100-S21), 585 (66.9%) isolates were ciprofloxacin susceptible. The susceptibility reduced to 11 (1.25%) isolates when interpreted using 2012 guidelines (M100-S22). Among the forty nalidixic acid susceptible (NAS) Salmonellae, susceptibility to ciprofloxacin decreased from 37 isolates (M100-S21) to 12 isolates (M100-S22). The 25 cases which appeared resistant with newer guidelines had a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) range between 0.125 and 0.5 mug/ml. MIC50 for the third generation cephalosporins varied between 0.125 and 0.5 mug/ml over 6 years whereas MIC90 varied with a broader range of 0.19-1 mug/ml. The gap between NAR and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains identified using 2011 guidelines has been reduced; however, it remains to be seen whether additional NAS, ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates are truly resistant to ciprofloxacin by other mechanisms of resistance.
