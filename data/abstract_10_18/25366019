Pseudomonas stutzeri (P. stutzeri) is a Gram-negative, non-fermenting rod. It is a rare pathogen; therefore, its isolation is often associated with colonization or contamination. We herein describe the first reported case of necrotizing pneumonia caused by P. stutzeri in a non-HIV infected patient with previously undiagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis. The isolate was found to be antibiotic resistant, which led to the failure of the initial treatment. This case highlights the unique presentation of necrotizing pneumonia caused by P. stutzeri and the importance of emerging antimicrobial resistance in P. stutzeri.
