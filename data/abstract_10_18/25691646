Colistin is one of the antibiotics of last resort for the treatment of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae infection. This study showed that capsular type K64 (50%) and ST11 (53.9%) are the prevalent capsular and sequence types in the colistin-resistant strains in Taiwan. The interruption of transcripts (38.5%) and amino acid mutation (15.4%) in mgrB are the major mechanisms contributing to colistin resistance. In addition, novel single amino acid changes in MgrB (Stop48Tyr) and PhoQ (Leu26Pro) were observed to contribute to colistin resistance.
