Beta defensins are antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) with a broad spectrum antimicrobial behavior against pathogens while having minimal tendency to incur pathogen resistance. Human beta-defensin 28 (hBD28) is a strongly cationic AMP and hence hypothesized to be highly effective in permeabilizing negatively-charged pathogen membranes. However, the scarcity of hBD28 in vivo has impeded detailed structure and antimicrobial studies of hBD28. Chemical synthesis of hBD28 rendered extremely poor yields due to inefficient cysteine oxidation. In this study, a rapid and scalable production route to produce bioactive hBD28 in Escherichia coli (E. coli) is reported. The design of a dual fusion tag expression construct was pivotal in enhancing soluble expression and easing purification of hBD28. The final hBD28 (purity >95%) displayed significant antimicrobial activity against E. coli K12 and showed dose-dependent killing kinetics. Circular dichroism spectroscopy confirmed the presence of both beta-sheet and alpha-helix conformations in the secondary structure of hBD28.
