BACKGROUND: The emergence of microbial resistance to antibiotics warrants the search for effective broad-spectrum antibacterial agents. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been used as antimicrobial agents. AgNPs encapsulated in nanolipososmes have been developed as effective antimicrobial agents. MATERIALS & METHODS: Nanoliposomes (<50 nm) were prepared using a modified reverse-phase evaporation method, and spherical, dextrose-capped AgNPs were synthesized. The prepared liposome AgNPs (LAgNPs) were characterized, and tested for their antibacterial effects. RESULTS: The size of LAgNPs is 25-80 nm. The release of AgNPs from nanoliposomes was sustained over 10 h. Complete growth inhibition of Eschericia coli, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus was achieved using 180, 200, 160 and 120 microM, respectively, of LAgNPs. LAgNPs exhibited sustained broad-spectrum antibacterial effects compared with free AgNPs. CONCLUSION: Nanoliposomes loaded with AgNPs are potentially effective broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. This new formula, which can be further fortified by encapsulation of additional established antibacterial agents, may be effective against antibiotic-resistant bacteria and also promote wound healing.
