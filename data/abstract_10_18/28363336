Bacterial persisters are phenotypic variants of an isogenic cell population that can survive antibiotic treatment and resume growth after the antibiotics have been removed. Cell dormancy has long been considered the principle mechanism underlying persister formation. However, dormancy alone is insufficient to explain the full range of bacterial persistence. Our recent work revealed that in addition to 'passive defense' via dormancy, persister cells employ 'active defense' via enhanced efflux activity to expel drugs. This finding suggests that persisters combine two seemingly contradictory mechanisms to tolerate antibiotic attack. Here, we review the passive and active aspects of persister formation, discuss new insights into the process, and propose new techniques that can facilitate the study of bacterial persistence.
