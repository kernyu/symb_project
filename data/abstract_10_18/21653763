Thirty-one antimicrobial-resistant, extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing strains of Vibrio cholerae O1 serotype Ogawa associated with an outbreak of cholera in South Africa (2008) were investigated. Ten selected cholera strains were PCR positive for the SXT element, harbored mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions of GyrA (Ser83-Ile) and ParC (Ser85-Leu), and produced TEM-63 beta-lactamase.
