OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution and drug-resistance of bacteria in the lower respiratory tract in patients with tuberculosis and severe pneumonia receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. METHODS: The clinical data, lower respiratory tract infection pathogens and bacterial drug sensitivity were analyzed in 208 patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation for tuberculosis and severe pneumonia. RESULTS: A total of 355 pathogenic microbial strains were obtained from the patients, among which 281 (79.2%) strains were Gram-negative bacteria, 62 (17.5%) were fungi, and 12 (3.4%) were Gram-positive bacteria. Mixed infections were found in 68 cases (19.2%). The sensitivity rates of meropenem, imipenem and amikacin were over 60% for Gram-negative bacteria, and those of teicoplanin, vancomycin, and fusidic acid were 100% for Gram-positive bacteria. CONCLUSION: The main pathogenic bacteria are Gram-negative bacteria, fungi and Gram-positive bacteria in the lower respiratory tract of patients with tuberculosis and severe pneumonia receiving mechanical ventilation. Meropenem, imipenem and amikacin are effective antibiotics for lower respiratory tract infections, and multi-drug resistance is frequent in these patients, which urges appropriate use of the antibiotics.
