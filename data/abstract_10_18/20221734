Haemophilus influenzae is a frequent causative bacterial pathogen of respiratory tract infections. Resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics has been a significant clinical problem in treatment for H. influenzae respiratory infections. This study describes the serotype, antibiotic resistance and distribution of TEM-1 or ROB-1 beta-lactamase in H. influenzae isolates from local private hospitals from 2002 to 2004. Among the 100 H. influenzae respiratory isolates, only 7% were identified as serotypes a, b, e, and f, with the remaining 93% being nontypeable. Resistance to ampicillin, cefaclor, and tetracycline was 57%, 46%, and 16%, respectively. All strains were susceptible to azithromycin and ciprofloxacin, whereas amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefotaxime, and imipenem exhibited reduced susceptibilities of 99%, 99%, and 91%, respectively. All 57 ampicillin-resistant strains (minimum inhibitory concentration, MIC>or=4 microg/ml) were beta-lactamase-positive and possessed the TEM-1 type beta-lactamase. One beta-lactamase-positive amoxicillin/clavulanate-resistant isolate that was resistant to ampicillin (MIC>128 microg/ml) had the TEM-1 type beta-lactamase and not susceptible to cefaclor and cefotaxime. Analysis of penicillin binding protein 3 revealed six residues (Asp-350, Met-377, Ala-502, Asn-526, Val-547, and Asn-569) that were substituted by Asn, Ile, Val, Lys, Ile, and Ser, respectively.
