Sixty-four Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains isolated from patients attending sexually transmitted disease clinics at Pune and Delhi between January 2007 and June 2008, were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, auxotyping, and serotyping. We observed 6 antibiotic resistance patterns, 6 auxotypes, 3 serogroups, and 17 serovars. The combination of auxotyping and serotyping is a potential useful method for typing N. gonorrhoeae as a result of high discriminatory index, rapidity, ease, and relatively lower cost.
