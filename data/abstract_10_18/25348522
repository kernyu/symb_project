The Acinetobacter baumannii clonal complex 113/79 (CC113/79) and class 2 integrons predominate in Latin America; a relationship between these characteristics was explored. The presence of integrases was determined in successive hospital Acinetobacter isolates (163 A. baumannii isolates and 72 Acinetobacter nosocomialis isolates). Most isolates had integrons, but class 1 and 2 integrons were present significantly more often in CC109/1 and CC113/79, respectively. The high prevalence of CC113/79 in Latin America may account for the predominance of class 2 integrons.
