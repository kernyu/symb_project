In this study HERAFILL((R)) granules containing gentamicin was evaluated as a bone void filling material once mixed with allograft bone grafts. The efficacy of the bone grafts mixed with HERAFILL((R)) was measured by drug release tests and bacterial susceptibility using Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus. The effect of storage at -80 degrees C on the delivery and efficacy of gentamicin from bone grafts mixed with HERAFILL((R)) was also investigated. Higher elution of gentamicin was detected in all stored groups (1 and 6 months) in comparison with non-stored samples. The gentamicin elution released from all groups was efficient on reducing S. aureus and S. epidermidis CFU. The susceptibility tests using S. aureus showed less resistance of the strain after 1 month of the elution storage. That resistance was not observed after 6 months of storage. The capacity of bone grafts to act as gentamicin carriers has been confirmed in this study. The different granules sizes did not interfere in the delivery rate of the antibiotics or in the activity against the bacteria. Storage at -80 degrees C does not interfere on the antibiotic activity.
