Biofilms are surface-associated microbial communities present in all environments. Although biofilms play important ecological roles, they also lead to negative or deleterious effects in industrial and medical settings. In the latter, high levels of antibiotic tolerance of bacterial biofilms developing on medical devices and during chronic infections determine the physiopathology of many healthcare-associated infections. Original approaches have been developed to avoid bacterial adhesion or biofilm development targetting specific mechanisms or pathways. We herein review recent data about biofilm lifestyle understanding and ways to fight against related infections.
