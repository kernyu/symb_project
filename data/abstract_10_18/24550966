OBJECTIVE: Antibiotic resistance is a global problem and is more prevalent in developing countries. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are recognized as important pathogen for nosocomial infections. This study was carried out to identify CoNS in various clinical specimens and to determine its antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. METHODS: A total of 2989 specimens of blood, pus and wound swab were collected from wards, casualty, ICU and OPD, out of these, staphylococci were isolated in 1000 specimens, of which 381 were identified as CoNS. Culture, gram stain, catalase, coagulase test and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern were done according to clinical manual of microbiology. A total of fourteen antibiotics were used in this study. Susceptibility testing was done by Kirby Bauer disc diffusion technique. RESULTS: Antimicrobial resistance of CoNS were Oxacillin (70.3%), Amoxicillin (74.8%), Amoxicillin+clavulanate (32.8%), Ciprofloxacin (35.2%), Ofloxacin (33.6%), Ceftriaxone (30.4%), Erythromycin (58.3%), Clindamycin (16.3%), Daptomycin (42.5%), Kanamycin (52.2%), Fusidic acid (41.7%), Doxycycline (24.7%), Vancomycin (2.6%) and Linezolid (0.8%). Maximum Oxacillin resistance was between 80 to 90 percent in a group of patients having age of 45 to 65 years and those suffering from cancer or admitted in ICU. CONCLUSION: The study concluded that CoNS showed significant level of resistance against most of the widely used therapeutic agents.
