The study was undertaken to describe the profile of patients and the characteristics of all multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria (MDR-GNB) and to assess mortality. We examined 138 patients with bloodstream infections (BSIs) caused by MDR-GNB. Clinical characteristics, antibiotic therapy, and in-hospital mortality were analyzed. Survivor and nonsurvivor subgroups were compared to identify predictors of mortality. The in-hospital mortality rate was 25.4%. Univariate analysis revealed that comorbidities and inadequate initial antimicrobial treatment could increase risk of death. In Cox regression analysis, mortality was independently associated with the age (P = .034), hospitalization in an intensive care unit (ICU) (P = .04), invasive procedures (P < .001), and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores (P < .001), whereas combination therapy or monotherapy was not associated with mortality (P = .829). Postantibiogram therapy was associated with hospitalization in an ICU (P = .006), Charlson comorbidity index score (P = .003), and inadequate initial antimicrobial treatment (P < .001). MDR-GNB strains and antimicrobial regimens were not the major risk factors of mortality. Inadequate initial antimicrobial treatment, invasive procedures, high Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II scores, hospitalization in an ICU, and comorbidities were the important factors responsible for mortality. Although there was no difference between combination therapy and monotherapy in mortality, combined treatment may be more effective than monotherapy for patients in an ICU, with a Charlson comorbidity index score < 4, or inadequate initial antimicrobial treatment.
