In our intensive care unit, coincident outbreaks were caused by concomitant cross-transmission of 2 carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strains harboring distinct mechanisms of resistance. One strain produced extended-spectrum ss-lactamase in combination with reduced permeability. The other produced oxacillinase-48 carbapenemase. Rapid phenotypic detection of carbapenemase production allowed timely implementation of appropriate infection control measures.
