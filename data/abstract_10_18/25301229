Influenza human infections are considered as a persistent global public health issue. Whereas vaccination is important for prevention, given its limitations, antiviral therapy is at the forefront of treatment, while it also plays a significant role in prevention. Currently, two classes of drugs, adamantanes (M2 blockers) and neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs), are available for treatment and chemoprophylaxis of influenza infections. Given the resistance patterns of circulating influenza strains, adamantanes are not currently recommended. The current review mainly focuses on the development of resistance to NAIs among A and B subtypes of influenza virus strains over the last 5 years. 'Permissive' drift mutations and reassortment of viral gene segments have resulted in NAI oseltamivir-resistant A/(H1N1) variants that rapidly became predominant worldwide in the period 2007-2009. However, the prevalence of antiviral resistance to NAI zanamivir remains relatively low. In addition, the recently developed NAIs, peramivir and laninamivir, while licensed in certain countries, are still under evaluation and only a few reports have described resistance to peramivir. Although in 2014, the majority of circulating human influenza viruses remains susceptible to all NAIs, the emergence of oseltamivir-resistant influenza variants that could retain viral transmissibility, highlights the necessity for enhanced epidemiological and microbiological surveillance and clinical assessment of antiviral resistance.
