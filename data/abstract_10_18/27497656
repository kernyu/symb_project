We report an H. parainfluenzae clinical isolate resistant to cefotaxime and with decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin recovered from a patient with cystic fibrosis. The isolate had elevated MICs of ampicillin (256mg/L), amoxicillin-clavulanate (8mg/L), cefuroxime (8mg/L) and cefotaxime (4mg/L), and showed a beta-lactamase-producing amoxicillin-clavulanic acid-resistant (BLPACR) phenotype. A blaTEM-1 plus five amino acid substitutions in the PBP3 were found: Ser385Thr, Val511Ala, Ile519Val, Asn526Lys and Asp551Leu. MIC of ciprofloxacin was 0.5mg/L, and substitutions in gyrA (Ser84Tyr) and parC (Ser84Phe) genes were detected.
