BACKGROUND: Odontogenic infections are frequently treated with antimicrobials. The inappropriate use of these medications has led to bacterial resistance and the development of species which are resistant to the antimicrobials currently available. This has serious implications for global public health. AIM: A multicycle clinical audit was carried out to compare the prescribing practices of three paediatric dental departments in the North of England. RESULTS: Results revealed deficiencies in prescribing practices in all three centres. Following education and the provision of an aide-memoire in subsequent cycles, improvements were seen in appropriateness of prescribing, increasing from 28% in the first cycle, to 71% in the third cycle.
