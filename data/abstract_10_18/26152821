Three Escherichia coli-Clostridia shuttle vectors, pKBA411-MCS, pKBE411-MCS, and pKBM411-MCS, which contain p15A, ColE1, and pMB1 origins for replication in E. coli, respectively, along with the pAMB origin for replication in C. beijerinckii, were constructed and examined for their transformation efficiencies into Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB8052. The transformation condition of pKBM411-MCS, which was optimized by varying resistance, buffer composition, and DNA concentration, was further employed for the transformation of the other plasmids, pKBA411-MCS and pKBE411-MCS into C. beijerinckii. It was found out that transformation efficiency is highly dependent on the origin of replication. The highest transformation efficiency of 7.44 x 10(3) colony-forming units per microgram of DNA was obtained at 5.0 kV cm(-1) field strength, 200 Omega resistance, 270 mM sucrose concentration, 150 ng mug(-1), and 3.0 mug DNA using pKBM411-MCS having pMB1 and pAMB origins of replication. The application of the newly constructed vector system was also investigated by introducing the putative alcohol dehydrogenase gene of C. beijerinckii.
