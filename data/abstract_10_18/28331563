AIM: To evaluate the association between biochemical, virologic and histologic features in patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB). BACKGROUND: Hepatitis-B e-antigen (HBeAg)-negative is common in Iran, is progressive with poor prognosis. Therefore, it seems necessary to perform a comprehensive evaluation of different spectrum of laboratory measurements accompanying histological findings. METHODS: HBeAg- negative CHB patients referring to two university hospitals during two years were enrolled. Alcohol consumption, liver mass, fatty liver and positive results of Anti HDV, Anti HCV or Anti HIV were excluded. The relationship between viral loads, liver enzymes (old and new cutoffs) and histopathological features was analyzed using descriptive and analytic statistical methods. RESULTS: A total of 150 HBeAg-negative CHB (males=110, mean age=38.44+/-11.34 years) were assessed. ALT had a significant relation with the logarithm of serum HBV-DNA (P<0.0001), grade and stage on liver biopsy (P<0.001, P=0.034, respectively). Serum viral load, AST and ALT were independent predictors of histological grade, age was the only independent predictor of the stage of liver fibrosis. There was a significant relationship between serum ALT and stage of liver fibrosis (P<0.0001) when new cutoff values for ALT were considered. We found that age had a significant relation with histological grade but it showed a reverse relation with ALT levels (P=0.009). CONCLUSION: In HBeAg-negative CHB, AST had a better prediction for liver necrosis and inflammation. Age could be an independent predictor for liver fibrosis. New cutoff values for ALT had superiority over conventional values to identify higher risk of liver fibrosis.
