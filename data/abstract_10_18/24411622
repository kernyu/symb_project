PURPOSE: Radiation resistance induced in cancer cells that survive after radiation therapy (RT) could be associated with increased radiation protection, limiting the therapeutic benefit of radiation. Herein we investigated the sequential mechanistic molecular orchestration involved in radiation-induced radiation protection in tumor cells. RESULTS: Radiation, both in the low-dose irradiation (LDIR) range (10, 50, or 100 cGy) or at a higher, challenge dose IR (CDIR), 4 Gy, induced dose-dependent and sustained NFkappaB-DNA binding activity. However, a robust and consistent increase was seen in CDIR-induced NFkappaB activity, decreased DNA fragmentation, apoptosis, and cytotoxicity and attenuation of CDIR-inhibited clonal expansion when the cells were primed with LDIR prior to challenge dose. Furthermore, NFkappaB manipulation studies with small interfering RNA (siRNA) silencing or p50/p65 overexpression unveiled the influence of LDIR-activated NFkappaB in regulating CDIR-induced DNA fragmentation and apoptosis. LDIR significantly increased the transactivation/translation of the radiation-responsive factors tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha), cMYC, and SOD2. Coculture experiments exhibit LDIR-influenced radiation protection and increases in cellular expression, secretion, and activation of radiation-responsive molecules in bystander cells. Individual gene-silencing approach with siRNAs coupled with coculture studies showed the influence of LDIR-modulated TNF-alpha, IL-1alpha, cMYC, and SOD2 in induced radiation protection in bystander cells. NFkappaB inhibition/overexpression studies coupled with coculture experiments demonstrated that TNF-alpha, IL-1alpha, cMYC, and SOD2 are selectively regulated by LDIR-induced NFkappaB. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data strongly suggest that scattered LDIR-induced NFkappaB-dependent TNF-alpha, IL-1alpha, cMYC, and SOD2 mediate radiation protection to the subsequent challenge dose in tumor cells.
