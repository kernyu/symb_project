We report the emergence and long-lasting persistence of linezolid resistance in an ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium strain in the intestine of a neutropenic oncohematologic patient receiving chemotherapy. The patient was first colonized by an epidemic ampicillin-resistant E. faecium (ARE)-ST117 clustering into lineage 78. This clone exhibited resistance to levofloxacin, erythromycin and high-level resistance to streptomycin and gentamicin. After receiving treatment with several broad spectrum antibiotics for febrile neutropenia, a 9-day course of oral linezolid was administered once the patient developed bacteraemia by the same ARE colonizing clone. Linezolid-resistant ARE was detected 17 days later in the follow-up fecal samples and persisted 41 days after suppression of linezolid therapy. Resistance to linezolid was associated with G2576T transversion in the 23S rRNA and the presence of cfr gene was not detected. The persistence of G2576T-ARE strains, especially in oncohematologic patients with injured intestinal membranes, could increase the risk of bacteraemia.
