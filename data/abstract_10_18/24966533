Study of antibiotic resistance was done among the metal tolerant E. coli isolates from hospital wastewater at Lucknow city. Metal tolerance was determined in terms of visible growth on metal amended plates at their varying concentrations. MICs were also determined among all metal tolerant E. coli isolates. All the isolates showed their MIC in between 100-2000 microg/ml while maximum isolates demonstrated their MICs at 400, 800 and 1600 microg/ml against all the metal tested. 23.07% of the isolates showed their MIC at 2000 microg/ml against Ni(3+). Multiple antibiotic resistances were recorded among all the metal resistant E.coli isolates. A high level of resistance was observed against Methicillin (86.53%) followed by penicillin (73.07%), Cephradin (57.69%), Rifampicin (34.61%), Erythromycin (26.92%), Nalidixic acids (25%), Chloramphenicol (3.84%) and least to Gentamycine (1.92%). Streptomycin was recorded most effective against E.coli isolates among the entire antibiotic tested. Antimicrobial resistance observed among the bacteria from the aquatic system contaminated with hospital wastes may be threatful for the environment and public health both.
