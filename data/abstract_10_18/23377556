The emergence and spread of vancomycin resistance among staphylococci, although rarely described in Japan to date, are major clinical concerns. We describe a case of central venous catheter-associated bloodstream infection in which Staphylococcus epidermidis intermediately resistant to vancomycin (minimum inhibitory concentration, 8 mug/ml) was isolated. The patient fully recovered with removal of the intravenous catheter.
