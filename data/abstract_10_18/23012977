The prevalence of the mutations associated with HIV fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide resistance in Russia and CIS countries was studied. Enfuvirtide resistance mutations were not observed among studied viruses in Russia and CIS countries so far. It was found that high rate (35%) of natural polymorphism mutations were associated with enfuvirtide hypersusceptibility. It was also found that high frequency of accessory mutations N126K and E137K were observed in the HR2 region (27.5%). The accessory mutations in HR2 can contribute to increased resistance and improve viral fitness. Our data were compared with those obtained in similar previous studies.
