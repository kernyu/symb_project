INTRODUCTION: Beta-lactams are at the cornerstone of therapy in critical care settings, but their clinical efficacy is challenged by the rise in bacterial resistance. Infections with multi-drug resistant organisms are frequent in intensive care units, posing significant therapeutic challenges. The problem is compounded by a dearth in the development of new antibiotics. In addition, critically-ill patients have unique physiologic characteristics that alter the drugs pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Areas covered: The prolonged infusion of antibiotics (extended infusion [EI] and continuous infusion [CI]) has been the focus of research in the last decade. As beta-lactams have time-dependent killing characteristics that are altered in critically-ill patients, prolonged infusion is an attractive approach to maximize their drug delivery and efficacy. Several studies have compared traditional dosing to EI/CI of beta-lactams with regard to clinical efficacy. Clinical data are primarily composed of retrospective studies and some randomized controlled trials. Several reports show promising results. Expert commentary: Reviewing the currently available evidence, we conclude that EI/CI is probably beneficial in the treatment of critically-ill patients in whom an organism has been identified, particularly those with respiratory infections. Further studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of EI/CI in the management of infections with resistant organisms.
