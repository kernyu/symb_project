One hundred sixty Salmonella enterica isolates from clinically healthy dairy cows were assayed for antibiotic susceptibilities, the presence of class 1 integrons, antimicrobial resistance genes and virulence genes, and conjugal transfer of antimicrobial resistance determinants. One hundred nine (68%) of the Salmonella isolates were resistant to at least 1 antibiotic, and 14 isolates (9%) were multiresistant. The most prevalent resistance observed was to streptomycin (64%). Class 1 integrons were detected in only two Salmonella isolates (serovar Singapore and Derby), and both integrons harbored the same cassette content aadA2. The Derby class 1 integrons were associated with Salmonella genomic island 1-A. Most commonly found resistance genes were strA and strB (9.2%). None of class 1 integrons were horizontally transferred, and the resistance genes were successfully transferred from six (5.5%) Salmonella strains. One hundred fifty-nine isolates (98.8%) were positive to the invasion gene invA, whereas the virulence plasmid-associated genes spvC and pefA were found in only two (1.3%) and one (0.6%) Salmonella isolates, respectively.
