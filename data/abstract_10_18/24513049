Eighteen N-(4-aryl/cyclohexyl)-2-(pyridine-4-yl carbonyl) hydrazinecarbothioamide derivatives were synthesized, evaluated against ten clinical isolates of Candida spp. and compared with itraconazole. Introduction of p-chloro (2c), p-iodo (2q), m-chloro (2l) and o-nitro (2r) substitution at phenyl ring of thiosemicarbazide enhanced the anti-Candida activity. Compound (2c) bearing p-cholorophenyl ring was found to be the most effective against Candida albicans ATCC 66027, Candida spp. 12810 (blood) and Candida spp. 178 (HVS) with MIC value of 0.09-0.78 mug/mL, whereas itraconazole exhibits the inhibitory activity with MIC value of 0.04-1.56 mug/mL against all tested strains. There is a correlation between anti-Candidal activity and p-chloro substitution at phenyl ring of thiosemicarbazide. All synthesized compounds were investigated for their potential cytotoxicity against non cancer cell line MCF-10A. The active compounds 2c, 2r and 2a were further investigated for their cytotoxic effects on three cancer cell lines; HT1080 (skin), HepG2 (liver) and A549 (lung). The active compounds showed minimal cytotoxic activity against non cancer cell line and all three cancer cell lines. Moreover, compound 2c displaying better activity against C. albicans ATCC66027 and Candida spp. [blood] compared to reference drug (itraconazole), represents a good lead for the development of newer, potent and broad spectrum anti-Candidal agents.
