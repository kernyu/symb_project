AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of moxifloxacin-based sequential therapy (MBST) versus hybrid therapy as a first-line treatment for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. METHODS: From August 2014 to January 2015, 284 patients with confirmed H. pylori infection were randomized to receive a 14-d course of MBST (MBST group, n = 140) or hybrid (Hybrid group, n = 144) therapy. The MBST group received 20 mg rabeprazole and 1 g amoxicillin twice daily for 7 d, followed by 20 mg rabeprazole and 500 mg metronidazole twice daily, and 400 mg moxifloxacin once daily for 7 d. The Hybrid group received 20 mg rabeprazole and 1 g amoxicillin twice daily for 14 d. In addition, the Hybrid group received 500 mg metronidazole and 500 mg clarithromycin twice daily for the final 7 d. Successful eradication of H. pylori infection was defined as a negative (13)C-urea breath test 4 wk after the end of treatment. Patient compliance was defined as "good" if drug intake was at least 85%. H. pylori eradication rates, patient compliance with treatment, and adverse event rates were evaluated. RESULTS: The eradication rates in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis were 91.4% (128/140; 95%CI: 90.2%-92.9%) in the MBST group and 79.2% (114/144; 95%CI: 77.3%-80.7%) in the Hybrid group (P = 0.013). The eradication rates in the per-protocol (PP) analysis were 94.1% (128/136; 95%CI: 92.9%-95.6%) in the MBST group and 82.6% (114/138; 95%CI: 80.6%-84.1%) in the Hybrid group (P = 0.003). The H. pylori eradication rate in the MBST group was significantly higher than that of the Hybrid group for both the ITT (P = 0.013) and the PP analyses (P = 0.003). Both groups exhibited full compliance with treatment (MBST/Hybrid group: 100%/100%). The rate of adverse events was 11.8% (16/136) and 19.6% (27/138) in the MBST and Hybrid group, respectively (P = 0.019). The majority of adverse events were mild-to-moderate in intensity; none were severe enough to cause discontinuation of treatment in either group. CONCLUSION: MBST was more effective and led to fewer adverse events than hybrid therapy as a first-line treatment for H. pylori infection.
