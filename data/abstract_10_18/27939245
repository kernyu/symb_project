BACKGROUND: Enhanced environmental cleaning practices are among the most accepted measures for controlling the spread of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CR-Ab). AIM: To evaluate the impact of heightened cleaning on an ongoing CR-Ab outbreak in a burn intensive care unit (BICU) of an Italian teaching hospital, where chlorhexidine-60% isopropyl alcohol was applied as a complementary disinfectant on high-touch surfaces. METHODS: Compliance with the microbial limit proposed for the BICU by AFNOR-NF-S90-351 (20 colony-forming units/100cm(2)) was assessed by plate count, and compared with the results obtained with intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) detection. Genotyping was performed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. FINDINGS: During the standard cleaning regimen, three out of 23 samples (13%) gave results over the AFNOR limit and five (21.7%) showed unacceptable ATP levels with 100 relative light units/100cm(2) as the benchmark limit (sensibility 86.4%, specificity 92.2%). Following improvement of the cleaning procedure, only two samples out of 50 (4%) did not satisfy the microbiological criteria and seven (14%) exceeded the ATP limit. In a successive phase, eight of 30 samples collected showed unacceptable results (27%). CONCLUSIONS: Adding chlorhexidine-60% isopropyl alcohol as complementary disinfectant proved to be effective for reducing environmental microbial contamination, ATP levels and CR-Ab infection/colonization in patients admitted to the BICU. Real-time monitoring by ATP assay was useful for managing the cleaning schedule and reducing hospital infections, although the calculated values must be interpreted as cleanliness indicators rather than risk indicators.
