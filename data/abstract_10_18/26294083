Vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR) exists widely in the chloroplasts of higher plants and plays important roles in redox regulation. However, investigations of plant VKOR function have primarily focused on VKOR from Arabidopsis, and knowledge concerning this function is therefore quite limited. In this study, Solanum lycopersicum was used to study the function of VKOR. Transcription level analysis revealed that SlVKOR (S. lycopersicum VKOR) expression was upregulated by salt or drought stress. To further investigate the function of SlVKOR in plants, we generated sense and antisense transgenic S. lycopersicum homozygotes at T2 generation plants. Compared with wild-type (WT) plants, the leaf disks of the SlVKOR overexpression plants retained a much higher percentage of chlorophyll after salt or drought treatment, whereas the antisense transgenic plants displayed an opposite response. The overexpressed plants displayed lower levels of H2O2 and superoxide anion radical (O2(.-)) than WT plants, whereas antisense plants accumulated considerably more H2O2 and O2(.-). The activities of reactive oxygen scavenger enzymes, including superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase and catalase, were consistent with the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Based on these results, we suggest that SlVKOR is involved in resistance to salt or drought stress.
