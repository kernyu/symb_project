Complicated intraabdominal infections require surgical intervention and the earliest possible empiric broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy. Doripenem, a broad-spectrum carbapenem, provides coverage of key Gram-negative and positive aerobes and anaerobes encountered in complicated intraabdominal infections. In two trials in patients with complicated intraabdominal infections, doripenem was not inferior to meropenem. Combining the results of the two studies, clinical cure rates at the test-of-cure assessment were 85.9% with doripenem and 85.3% with meropenem. Microbiological cure rates were 84.3% with doripenem and 84.5% with meropenem. Doripenem was more effective in the treatment of patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In conclusion, doripenem is a valuable addition to the options available for the empirical treatment of hospitalized patients with serious intraabdominal infections.
