Eravacycline and comparators were tested against carbapenem- and tigecycline-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter isolates received at the United Kingdom's national reference laboratory. Eravacycline MICs correlated closely with those of tigecycline but mostly were around 2-fold lower; both molecules retained full activity against isolates with high-level tetracycline and minocycline resistance. MIC90s of eravacycline and tigecycline were raised ca. 2-fold for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae compared with carbapenem-susceptible controls, probably reflecting subsets of isolates with increased efflux.
