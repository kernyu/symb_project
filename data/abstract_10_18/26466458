Although, since discovering Koch's bacilli over 130 years have passed, and 70 since the invention of the first antituberculous drug, the epidemic of this illness has not been brought under control. It is still an important health problem of the contemporary world. In the 21st century co-infection with the Koch's bacillus and HIV, as well as multidrug-resistance, will be a challenge for medicine. In countries with a good epidemiological situation the prevalence of the disease is becoming a problem in particular populations, such as immigrants, homeless, prisoners, elderly persons and people with immunodeficiency. A tighter control of infection in these groups is necessary.
