A carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strain, Kp5196, was responsible for an uncomplicated cystitis in a patient living at home and without history of foreign travel. This isolate produced the metallocarbapenemase NDM-1 and was resistant to all antibiotics except tetracyclines and colistin. The K. pneumoniae strain belonged to sequence type ST15, and bla(NDM-1) was carried by a nontypeable conjugative plasmid. Two months later, a similar ST15 isolate, Kp5241, was present in the patient but was additionally colistin resistant.
