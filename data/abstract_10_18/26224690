OBJECTIVE: To estimate health care costs associated with medical events identified as antiretroviral therapy (ART)-attributable adverse events (AEs). METHODS: During September 2006 to June 2012, adults with >/=1 HIV International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis code (042/V08), >/=1 claim for ART prescription (March 2007-June 2011; index date), and continuous health plan enrollment for >/=6 months pre- and >/=12 months postindex were included (IMS' PharMetrics Plus Health Plan Claims Database). Patients with events of interest/ART claim during preindex period or with pregnancy/hepatitis C virus diagnosis/hepatitis B virus/cancer/tuberculosis during the study period were excluded. Postindex medical events were defined as first diagnosis code of event with ART claim </=60 days prior to start of the event. RESULTS: Differences in median total all-cause health care costs observed for diabetes/insulin resistance management (US$14,547 median all-cause health care costs during time periods identified as diabetes/insulin resistance medical events versus US$11,237 without diabetes/insulin resistance events; P=.0021), lipid disorders (US$12,825 versus US$10,033; P=.0004), and renal disorders (US$1389 versus US$0; P<.0001). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Health care costs of ART AEs should be key consideration for payers/providers in HIV management.
