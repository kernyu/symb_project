OBJECTIVES: The known data about the influence of vancomycin MIC on Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia are contradictory. Our objective was to study the possible impact of vancomycin MIC >/=1.5 mg/L on short- and medium-term mortality. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was carried out from March 2008 to January 2011 on adult patients with MSSA bacteraemia admitted to a tertiary hospital located in Seville (Spain). We studied the relationship between vancomycin MIC, accessory gene regulator (agr) type and absence of delta-haemolysin and poor prognosis. All isolates were genotyped by PFGE. Multivariate analysis, including a propensity score for having a vancomycin MIC of >/=1.5 mg/L, was performed by Cox regression. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-five episodes of bacteraemia due to MSSA were included in the analysis. Twenty-nine (21.5%) isolates had a vancomycin MIC of >/=1.5 mg/L by Etest. There were no differences in agr distribution or absence of delta-haemolysin between isolates with reduced vancomycin susceptibility (RVS) and those without. RVS was not more frequent in specific clones; RVS was not associated with higher 14 or 30 day crude mortality (relative risk = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.14-1.35; and relative risk = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.52-1.96) rates, and it did not show higher rates of complicated bacteraemia (14.2% versus 13.8%, P = 0.61). Cox regression analysis did not significantly modify the results for 14 day mortality (HR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.11-1.34) or 30 day mortality (HR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.39-2.04). CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to previously published data, we did not find a relationship between RVS and higher mortality in patients with MSSA bacteraemia and we did not find a link with higher complicated bacteraemia rates.
