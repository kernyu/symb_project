The rate of mupirocin resistance in meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in Besancon University Hospital is low with a decreasing trend, from 10% in 2004 to 3% in 2009. This trend in resistance paralleled mupirocin consumption. Genotyping results showed that this decrease was not linked to a change in MRSA clones. It appears that the way in which the mupirocin is used, rather than the volume, plays a role in the emergence of resistance and that its cautious use is likely to maintain the mupirocin resistance at a low level, thus preserving its efficacy.
