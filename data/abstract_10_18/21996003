An atovaquone (ATV)-resistant Babesia gibsoni was developed by in vitro exposure of uncloned wild type (WT) B. gibsoni to 800 nM ATV for 6 days. Sequence analysis of mitochondrial genes showed a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at cytb nt363 (G to T) that resulted in the substitution of methionine with isoleucine (M121I), which is one of the SNPs reported in a previous in vivo study. 363T or 363G allele-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) revealed that an M121I variant was present in over 99% of the ATV-resistant population. As neither ATV resistance nor gene polymorphisms appeared in the B. gibsoni WT sibling clones, the expression of ATV resistance in this study was suspected to be because of selective multiplication of the B. gibsoni M121I variant. This ATV-resistant B. gibsoni displayed the same sensitivity as the WT B. gibsoni against 5 other drugs, including diminazene aceturate, azithromycin, doxycycline, clindamycin, and proguanil. This is the first report on the in vitro establishment of an ATV-resistant B. gibsoni with gene polymorphisms.
