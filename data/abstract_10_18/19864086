BACKGROUND: The CASFM 2008 don't recommend to search a BLSE for Enterobacteriaceae (E-BLSE) having a aac(6'). So we wanted to take stock of antibiotics co-resistances in our laboratory for these bacteria. We look for the aminoglycosides and quinolones FQ. METHODS: We studies all E-BLSE isolated in our laboratory from the 1(st) six month of 2005 to the 1st six month of 2008. Only one isolate per patient were included in this study. For each bacterial strain aminoglycosides and quinolones FQ (nalidixic acid [NA], ciprofloxacin [CIP]) were tested. RESULTS: A total of 124 E-BLSE isolates were studied. Escherichia coli increases (12 to 86%) and Enterobacter spp decreases (33 to 5%). We can note an increase of sensibles strains (6 to 23%).The mainly resistance associated is the FQ resistance (CIP: 88 to 68%). The resistance of aminoglycosides is almost associated with the NA resistance (59 to 36%). The presence of aac(6') decreases (29 to 1%). CONCLUSION: BLSE are mainly produced by Escherichia coli and antibiotics coresistances change: increase sensibles strains, supremacy of FQ resistance and decrease of the aac(6').This results can have repercussions on antibiotherapy.
