Polymyxin B and colistin are currently used as a 'last-line' treatment for multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. However very little is known about the pharmacological differences between polymyxin B1, polymyxin B2, colistin A, colistin B, the major cyclic lipopeptides components present in polymyxin B and colistin products. Here, we report on the in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity and toxicity of these major lipopeptide components. All four lipopeptides had comparable MICs (<0.125-4 mg/L) against a panel of clinical Gram-negative isolates. They also had comparable in vivo antimicrobial activity (Deltalog10 CFU/mL >-3) and nephrotoxicity (mild to moderate histological damage) in mouse models. However, polymyxin B1 and colistin A showed significantly higher (> 3-fold) in vitro apoptotic effect on human kidney proximal tubular HK-2 cells than polymyxin B2 and colistin B, respectively. Compared to the commercial polymyxin and colistin products, the individual lipopeptide components had slightly more in vivo antimicrobial activity. Our results highlight the need to re-assess pharmacopoeial standards for polymyxins B and colistin and to standardize the composition of the different commercial products of polymyxin antibiotics.
