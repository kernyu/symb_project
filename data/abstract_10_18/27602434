Campylobacter spp. have been isolated from various animals, including poultry. They are rapidly transmitted throughout broiler sheds by the fecal-oral route. A promising strategy to reduce Campylobacter spp. in poultry may be done due to the beneficial properties of probiotic bacteria and their bacteriocins. In this study, inhibition spectrum/activity of different enterocins was evaluated against Campylobacter spp. (isolated from different poultry) to indicate further practical use of enterocins. Enterocins are antimicrobial proteinaceous substances produced mostly by enterococci. Feces from broiler chickens (10), laying hens (47), ostriches (140), and ducks (40) were screened. Altogether, 23 strains were allotted to the species Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli using MALDI TOF mass spectrometry and confirmed by genotyping (PCR method). In the feces of ostriches, Campylobacter spp. were not confirmed. Campylobacter spp. isolated from different poultry showed resistance to nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, and ampicillin. Interestingly, strains demonstrating antibiotic resistance revealed sensitivity to at least one of the nine enterocins used (except C. coli Kc1, SZ3, and C. jejuni 1/D). Almost 52% strains were inhibited by Ent A (P). Enterocins can therefore be used to prevent or reduce Campylobacter spp.; it is a basis for practical use.
