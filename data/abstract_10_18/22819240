Recent reports suggest that false-positive rifampicin resistance may be assigned by the Xpert MTB/RIF assay. We analysed 169 specimens using the MTB/RIF assay. Using culture as the gold standard, we found that the assay had 100% sensitivity and specificity for detecting M. tuberculosis. However, we found that the assay incorrectly assigned rifampicin resistance in 4/13 (31%) of cases.
