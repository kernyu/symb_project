Hepatitis C is one of the commonest public health problems with 130 million people infected worldwide and the burden is increasing. Previously, Interferon along with Ribavirin was the mainstay of treatment but it was associated with toxic side effects. An all-oral regimen with higher rates of sustained viral response (SVR), minimal side effects and no restriction for liver fibrosis staging, was long awaited. Several all-oral interferon-free direct acting antiviral agents (DAAs) have now been approved by FDAfor different genotypes of HCV. These include Sofosbuvir, Ledipasvir, Daclatasvir, Simeprevir, Dasabuvir, Ombitasvir, Paritaprevir and Ritonavir. These agents are also available in different combinations commercially under various trade names. Anumber of studies have proved their efficacy and the AASLD and EASLguidelines recommend several options for each genotype in different categories including treatment naive, relapsers, failure, compensated and decompensated cirrhosis. The purpose of this article is to review the persistently changing treatment regimens for hepatitis C and to simplify the dynamicity of the subject and selection of appropriate regimen for these patients.
