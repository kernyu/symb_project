Because of the growing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance strains, there is an increasing need to develop material surfaces that prevent bacterial attachment and contamination in the absence of antibiotic agents. Herein, we present bacterial antiadhesive materials inspired from rice leaves. "Rice leaf-like surfaces" (RLLS) were fabricated by a templateless, self-masking reactive-ion etching approach. Bacterial attachment on RLLS was characterized under both static and dynamic conditions using Gram-negative Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus. RLLS surfaces showed exceptional bacterial antiadhesion properties with a >99.9% adhesion inhibition efficiency. Furthermore, the optical properties of RLLS were investigated using UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometry. In contrast to most other bacterial antiadhesive surfaces, RLLS demonstrated optical-grade transparency (i.e., >/=92% transmission). We anticipate that the combination of bacterial antiadhesion efficiency, optical grade transparency, and the convenient single-step method of preparation makes RLLS a very attractive candidate for the surfaces of biosensors; endoscopes; and microfluidic, bio-optical, lab-on-a-chip, and touchscreen devices.
