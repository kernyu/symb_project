AIM: To evaluate virological response to adefovir (ADV) monotherapy and emergence of ADV-resistant mutations in lamivudine (LAM)-resistant chronic hepatitis B patients. METHODS: Seventy-seven patients with documented LAM resistance who were treated with 10 mg/d ADV for > 96 wk were analyzed for ADV resistance. RESULTS: At week 48 and 96, eight (10%) and 14 (18%) of 77 LAM-resistant patients developed the ADV-resistant strain (rtA181V/T and/or rtN236T mutations), respectively. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels during therapy were significantly higher in patients who developed ADV resistance than in those who did not. Incidence of ADV resistance at week 96 was 11%, 8% and 6% among patients with complete virological response (HBV DNA level < 60 IU/mL); 0%, 5% and 19% among patients with partial virological response (HBV DNA level >/= 60 to 2000 IU/mL); and 32%, 34% and 33% among patients with inadequate virological response (HBV DNA levels > 2000 IU/mL) at week 12, week 24 and week 48, respectively. HBV DNA levels > 2000 IU/mL at week 24 showed best performance characteristics in predicting ADV resistance. CONCLUSION: Development of ADV resistance mutations was associated with HBV DNA levels, which could identify patients with LAM resistance who are likely to respond to ADV monotherapy.
