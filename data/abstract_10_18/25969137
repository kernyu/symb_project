A total of 300 food samples including 180 milk and 120 meat products have been examined for the presence of Yersinia spp. using the ISO 10273 and the cold enrichment method. The overall prevalence of Yersinia spp. was 84 (28%). Yersinia enterocolitica was isolated from 18 (6%) of the 300 samples. The other Yersinia species were detected in the samples Yersinia rohdei 15 (5%), Yersinia intermedia 14 (4.7%), Yersinia pseudotuberculosis 12 (4%), Yersinia ruckeri 12 (4%), Yersinia mollaretii 5 (1.7%), Yersinia bercovieri 4 (1.3%), and atypical Yersinia spp. 4 (1.3%). The conventionally identified Y. enterocolitica strains were also confirmed by the 16S rRNA gene sequencing. All Y. enterocolitica strains biotyped as 1A had negative results in the phenotypic virulence tests. The 84 Yersinia strains were also examined genotypically for the presence of virulence genes. None of the Y. enterocolitica and other Yersinia strains contained the ail, ystA, yadA, and virF except only 1 Y. intermedia and 2 Y. enterocolitica strains that were found to be positive for ystB. Antimicrobial resistance of 84 Yersinia to 16 antimicrobial agents was determined by the disk diffusion method. All strains were sensitive to tobramycine and imipenem while resistant to clindamycin. Although 84.5% of the strains were resistant to at least 3 or more antimicrobial agents, 64.3% of them were resistant to 4 or more antimicrobial agents.
