Staphylococcus rostri is a newly described Staphylococcus species that is present in the nasal cavity of healthy pigs. Out of the 225 pigs tested at slaughterhouse, 46.7% carried the new species alone and 22% in combination with Staphylococcus aureus. An antibiotic resistance profile was determined for S. rostri and compared to that of S. aureus isolated from the same pig. Resistance to tetracycline specified by tet(M), tet(K) and tet(L), streptomycin (str(pS194)), penicillin (blaZ), trimethoprim (dfr(G)), and erythromycin and clindamycin (erm genes), were found in both species; however, with the exception of streptomycin and trimethoprim, resistance was higher in S. aureus. S. rostri isolates display very low genetic diversity as demonstrated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, which generated two major clusters. Several clonal complexes (CC1, CC5, CC9, CC30 and CC398) were identified in S. aureus with CC 9 and CC 398 being the most frequent. Our study gives the first overview of the distribution, genetic relatedness, and resistance profile of one coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species that is commonly present in the nares of healthy pigs in Switzerland, and shows that S. rostri may harbor resistance genes associated with transferable elements like Tn916.
