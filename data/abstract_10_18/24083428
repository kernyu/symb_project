INTRODUCTION: Fatty acid biosynthesis is essential for the bacterial viability and growth. In recent years, beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase III (FabH) become an attractive new target, which catalyzes the first step of fatty acid biosynthesis, and FabH inhibitors could be potential candidates for antibacterial agents. In this review, recent advances in the research of FabH inhibitors are reviewed. AREAS COVERED: This updated review summarized new patents and articles publications on FabH inhibitors within July 2012 to June 2013. EXPERT OPINION: The review gives the latest development in the area of FabH inhibitors which aim to solve the bacterial resistance. The potent antibacterial activities of the selected compounds are probably correlated to their FabH inhibitory. Molecular docking of the most potent compound in every kind of compounds against FabH was also reviewed to explore the binding mode of the compound at the active site.
