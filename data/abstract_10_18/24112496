INTRODUCTION: Antimicrobial prophylaxis remains the most powerful tool used to reduce infection rates in orthopaedics but the choice of antibiotic is complex. The aim of this study was to examine trends in antimicrobial prophylaxis in orthopaedic surgery involving the insertion of metalwork between 2005 and 2011. METHODS: Two questionnaires (one in 2008 and one in 2011) were sent to all National Health Service trusts in the UK using the Freedom of Information Act. RESULTS: In total, 87% of trusts that perform orthopaedic surgery responded. The use of cefuroxime more than halved between 2005 and 2011 from 80% to 36% and 78% to 26% in elective surgery and trauma surgery respectively. Combination therapy with flucloxacillin and gentamicin rose from 1% to 32% in elective and 1% to 34% in trauma surgery. Other increasingly popular regimes include teicoplanin and gentamicin (1% to 10% in elective, 1% to 6% in trauma) and co-amoxiclav (3% to 8% in elective, 4% to 14% in trauma). The majority of changes occurred between 2008 and 2010. Over half (56%) of the trusts stated that Clostridium difficile was the main reason for changing regimes. CONCLUSIONS: In 2008 a systematic review involving 11,343 participants failed to show a difference in surgical site infections when comparing different antimicrobial prophylaxis regimes in orthopaedic surgery. Concerns over C difficile and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus have influenced antimicrobial regimes in both trauma and elective surgery. Teicoplanin would be an appropriate choice for antimicrobial prophylaxis in both trauma and elective units but this is not reflected in its current level of popularity.
