OBJECTIVE: One of the most important threats of current medicine is the spread of multiresistant Gram-negative bacteria. We report here data from a six-month prevalence study on carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae and E. coli performed in Czech hospitals participating on European Survey on Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacteriaceae (EuSCAPE). METHODS: Ten hospitals covering all regions of the Czech Republic were selected. During the study period (1st November 2013 to 30th April 2014), first ten carbapenem non-susceptible isolates of K. pneumoniae or E. coli isolated from non-surveillance specimens (i.e., blood, lower respiratory tract secretions, urine, puncture fluids, and wound secretions) of single successive patients were collected. Successive carbapenem-susceptible isolates of the same species were also preserved as controls. Susceptibility to 15 antibiotics was determined using EUCAST recommendations. Carbapenemase activity was detected by MALDI-TOF MS meropenem hydrolysis assay. Positive isolates were subjected for molecular typing (multi-locus sequence typing, identification of carbapenemase gene). RESULTS: During the study period, thirty non-susceptible isolates (K. pneumoniae n=28, E. coli n=2) were identified in 5 hospitals. Only two of them were confirmed to be carbapenemase producers. A NDM-1-producing K. pneumoniae ST11 was recovered from a patient, transferred from Ukraine, being injured during a Maidan revolution. The second isolate, an OXA-48-producing K. pneumoniae, belonging to ST101, was recovered from a patient admitted to a hospital for an ischemic stroke. CONCLUSIONS: This study again confirmed that the Czech Republic still belongs to the countries with low prevalence of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE). Cases of CPE are usually restricted to an import from high-prevalence countries or countries with unknown epidemiological situation.
