ACHN-490 was tested alone and in combination with cefepime, doripenem, imipenem, or piperacillin-tazobactam in a synergy time-kill analysis against 25 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains with different resistance phenotypes. Each combination was synergistic against most isolates at 24 h, and antagonism was not observed. Combinations of ACHN-490 with cefepime, doripenem, imipenem, or piperacillin-tazobactam yielded synergies in >/=70% and >/=80% of strains at 6 and 12 h, respectively, and in >/=68% at 24 h.
