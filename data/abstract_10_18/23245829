Staphylococcus epidermidis is the predominant bacterial species in the normal flora of the human skin and superficial mucosal membranes. However, it has also emerged as the most important pathogen in infections related to foreign-body materials, such as prosthetic joints and heart valves. The aims of this study were to characterise S. epidermidis isolated from prosthetic joint infections (PJI; n=61) and commensal isolates from healthy individuals (n=24) in regard to antimicrobial sensitivity, agr type, hld gene presence, biofilm production including presence of ica and aap genes involved in the biofilm formation process and epidemiology using both phenotypic (the PhenePlate-system) and genotypic [multilocus sequence typing (MLST)] methods. Among the PJI isolates, the majority (67%) were multidrug-resistant. Two major clusters of PJI isolates could be identified; 44% belonged to MLST sequence type (ST) 2, all but one were of agr type 1, and 31% were assigned ST215 and were of agr type 3. Of the commensal isolates, only one isolate was multidrug-resistant, and they were more molecular epidemiologically diverse with mainly MLST singletons and a maximum of 3 isolates assigned to the identical ST. Biofilm production was detected in 41% of the PJI isolates and 58% of the commensal isolates, with the aap gene (95%) more frequently detected than the ica genes (62%) in the biofilm-positive isolates. In conclusion, S. epidermidis isolated from PJIs and commensal isolates differed regarding antimicrobial sensitivity and molecular epidemiological typing using MLST, but not substantially in the distribution of agr types, biofilm production, or the presence of ica and aap genes.
