Susceptibility in vitro and trends in resistance to antimicrobials were determined by a dilution micromethod in a group of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica and Escherichia coli isolates from clinical cases of cattle and swine diseases in the Czech Republic from 2007 to 2011. A high susceptibility of pig and cattle respiratory pathogens to antimicrobials was found, with the exception of the moderate prevalence of M. haemolytica resistance to ampicillin. In contrast to respiratory pathogens, low susceptibility of E. coli of pig and cattle isolates to ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was noted. Regarding resistance trends, an increase in levels of resistance among E. coli isolates to ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was identified, but the resistance of respiratory isolates was low, with the exception of M. haemolytica. For the period of 2007-2011, there was a significant and almost continuous increase in sales (compared with population correction unit) of ceftiofur, cefquinome and other beta lactams for pigs. Consumption peaked in 2010. In the case of amoxicillin in combination with clavulanic acid, data showed a significant decrease in sales from 2007 to 2008, followed by a period of fluctuation. In cattle, within the groups of 3rd and 4th generation cephalosporins and for the whole group of other betalactams for the period of 2007-2011, there was a significant and almost continuous increase in sales (compared with population correction unit). Consumption peaked in 2010. In the case of ceftiofur, there was a huge increase noted from 2010. In the case of amoxicillin in combination with betalactamase inhibitor (clavulanic acid) data shows a significant decrease from 2007 to 2008, followed by a period of fluctuation in sales.
