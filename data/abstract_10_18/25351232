The purpose of this retrospective study was to identify bacterial species in cats with bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) and to investigate their antimicrobial susceptibilities over a 10-year period. Three hundred and thirty cultures from 280 cats were included in the study. The mean age of affected cats was 9.9 years; female cats with bacterial UTIs were significantly older than male cats with UTIs. The most common pathogen identified was Escherichia coli (42.3 per cent), followed by Streptococcus species (19.3 per cent), Staphylococcus species (15.6 per cent), Enterococcus species (6.6 per cent) and Micrococcaceae (5.8 per cent). Forty specimens (12.1 per cent) yielded growth of more than one isolate. Streptococcus and Enterococcus isolates were resistant to a significantly higher number of antimicrobial agents than E coli and Staphylococcus species isolates. Applying the formula to select rational antimicrobial therapy, bacterial isolates were most likely to be susceptible to nitrofurantoin, amoxicillin clavulanic acid, enrofloxacin and gentamicin. The antimicrobial impact factor for nitrofurantoin increased significantly over the 10-year period, whereas there was no significant change in antimicrobial impact factors for doxycycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, gentamicin, enrofloxacin, cephalothin and amoxicillin clavulanic acid. The detected changes in in vitro antimicrobial efficacy could help to develop hospital-specific guidelines for antimicrobial use to prevent the further development of resistance in feline uropathogens.
