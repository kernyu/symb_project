PURPOSE: The use of a three-drug regimen for the prevention of perinatal transmission of zidovudine- and nevirapine-resistant HIV is described. SUMMARY: A 17-year-old Hispanic woman infected with HIV arrived at our clinic for the management of her first pregnancy. The patient was in her second trimester of her pregnancy, had not previously been treated with antiretroviral therapy, and was only taking daily prenatal vitamins at the time of her first clinic visit. Her HIV RNA viral load was 240 copies/mL, and the virus was resistant to both zidovudine and nevirapine. Nelfinavir (compounded suspension), lamivudine, and zidovudine were prescribed for the mother, though she was generally nonadherent to therapy. Nelfinavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine were initiated for the newborn within eight hours of delivery. Six months later, the patient returned to the clinic in the first trimester of her second pregnancy. At this visit, her HIV RNA viral load was 120 copies/mL. After the birth of her second child, the infant received the same regimen received by her firstborn: zidovudine 4 mg/kg orally twice daily for six weeks, lamivudine 2 mg/kg orally twice daily for two weeks, and nelfinavir 55 mg/kg orally twice daily for two weeks. At four months of age, each infant was found to be HIV-negative. CONCLUSION: A prophylactic regimen that included nelfinavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine was used to prevent perinatal transmission of HIV in two neonates. The regimen was well tolerated, and both infants were determined to be HIV-negative at four months of age.
