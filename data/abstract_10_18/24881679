Traditionally, management of infectious diseases focuses on identification of the causative microbe and the use of pathogen-targeted therapy. With increasing antimicrobial resistance, novel approaches are required. One strategy is to modulate those natural host immune responses that critically mediate resistance to specific microbes. Clinically, this host-directed tactic could be used either alone or in combination with antimicrobial therapy. While conceptually attractive, there is potential concern that the pathways governing host resistance to pathogens in animal models may not extrapolate linearly to humans. Targeting these immune processes clinically may precipitate damaging, epiphenomenal responses. The field of Primary Immunodeficiencies focuses on the characterization of humans with inborn errors of immunity. These rare conditions permit the identification of those molecular and cellular processes that are central to human susceptibility to microbes. In efforts to compensate for defective host responses, this field has also provided a wealth of clinical experience in the effective use of cytokines to treat various active infections, while demonstrating their safety. In this review, we provide a historical perspective of the treatment of infectious diseases, evolving from a focus on the microbe, to an understanding of human immunity; we then outline the growing contribution of Primary Immunodeficiencies to the rational use of adjunctive cytokine immunotherapy in the management of infections.
