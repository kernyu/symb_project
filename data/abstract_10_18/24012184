New antibiotics are needed, and one source may be 'latent' antibiotics, natural products whose once broad-spectrum activity is currently limited by the evolution of resistance in nature. We have identified a potential class of latent antibiotics, the arylomycins, which are lipopeptides with a C-terminal macrocycle that target signal peptidase and whose spectrum is limited by a resistance-conferring mutation in many bacteria. Herein, we report the synthesis and evaluation of several arylomycin derivatives, and demonstrate that both C-terminal homologation with a glycyl aldehyde and addition of a positive charge to the macrocycle increase the activity and spectrum of the arylomycin scaffold.
