Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) confer bacterial resistance to critically important antimicrobials, including extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs). Livestock are important reservoirs for the zoonotic food-borne transmission of ESC-resistant enteric bacteria. Our aim is to describe the potential role of migratory and resident wild birds in the epidemiology of ESBL-mediated bacterial resistance on dairy farms. Using mist nets, we sampled wild migratory and resident birds either immediately adjacent to or 600 ft away from free-stall barns on three Ohio dairy farms during the 2014 and 2015 spring migrations. Individual swabs were used to obtain both a cloacal and external surface swab from each bird. Samples were inoculated into MacConkey broth containing cefotaxime then inoculated onto MacConkey agar with cefoxitin, cefepime, or meropenem to identify the blaCMY, blaCTX-M, and carbapenemase phenotypes, respectively. Six hundred twenty-three birds were sampled, 19 (3.0%) of which harbored bacteria with blaCMY and 32 (5.1%) harbored bacteria with blaCTX-M from either their cloacal sample or from their external swab. There was no difference in the prevalence of either gene between migratory and resident birds. Prevalence of blaCMY and blaCTX-M was higher among birds sampled immediately outside the barns compared with those sampled 600 ft away. Our results suggest that wild birds can serve as mechanical and/or biological vectors for Enterobacteriaceae with resistance to ESCs. Birds live in close contact with dairy cows and their feed, therefore, transmission locally between farms is possible. Finding a similar prevalence in migratory and nonmigratory birds suggests the potential for regional and intercontinental movement of these resistance genes via birds.
