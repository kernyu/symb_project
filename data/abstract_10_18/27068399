OBJECTIVES: Boosted PIs are commonly prescribed in patients presenting with advanced HIV infection. We assessed the efficacy and tolerability of once-daily ritonavir-boosted atazanavir or darunavir plus two NRTIs in HIV-1-infected ART-naive patients with severe immunosuppression, targeting at least an 85% success rate at week 48. METHODS: This 48 week, open-label, non-comparative, randomized, multicentre trial included ART-naive patients with CD4 cell counts <200 cells/mm(3), with plasma HIV-1 RNA >1000 copies/mL and without genotypic mutations conferring resistance to the study drugs. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive once-daily atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg) or darunavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg) plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine or abacavir/lamivudine. The primary endpoint was treatment success, defined as plasma HIV-1 RNA </=50 copies/mL at week 48 and no permanent PI/ritonavir discontinuation. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01928407). RESULTS: One hundred and twenty patients were enrolled: 77% were men, 30% were born in Africa and 39% had AIDS. The median baseline CD4 and plasma HIV-RNA values were 69 cells/mm(3) and 5.4 log10 copies/mL. All but four patients received tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine. The week 48 treatment success rate was 66% (95% CI 54%-78%) with atazanavir/ritonavir and 80% (95% CI 68%-89%) with darunavir/ritonavir. The median CD4 cell count increased similarly in the two groups (Deltaweek 48 to week 0: +194 cells/mm(3)). Adverse events occurred in 23 and 18 patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Despite good adherence, neither study regimen reached the predefined objective, suggesting a need for more potent regimens for patients with advanced HIV infection.
