The aim of this study was to determine the complete sequence of the multi-resistance plasmid pV7037 to gain insight into the structure and organization of this plasmid. Of the four XbaI clones of pV7037, one clone of 17,577 bp has already been sequenced and shown to carry a multi-resistance gene cluster. The remaining three clones of approximately 12.5, 6.5 and 4.5 kb were sequenced, the entire plasmid sequence correctly assembled and investigated for reading frames. In addition, two reading frames one coding for an ABC transporter and the other coding for an rRNA methylase were cloned and expressed in a S. aureus host to see whether they confer antimicrobial resistance properties. Plasmid pV7037 proved to be 40,971 bp in size. Besides the previously determined resistance gene cluster, it carried a functionally active tet(L) gene for tetracycline resistance, a complete cadDX operon for cadmium resistance and also a variant of the beta-lactamase transposon Tn552. Two single bp deletions, which resulted in frame shifts, functionally deleted the genes for the BlaZ beta-lactamase and the signal transducer protein BlaR1 in this Tn552 variant of pV7037. Plasmid pV7037 seems to be composed of various parts previously known from plasmids and transposons of staphylococci and other Gram-positive bacteria. However, there are also parts of the plasmid which do not show any homology to so far known sequences deposited in the databases. The novel ABC transporter and rRNA methylase genes identified on pV7037 do not seem to play a role in antimicrobial resistance. The co-location of numerous antimicrobial resistance genes bears the risk of co-transfer and co-selection of resistance genes, but also persistence of resistance genes even if no direct selective pressure by the use of the respective antimicrobial agents is applied.
