The rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria along with increasing difficulty in biofilm treatment has caused an immediate need for the development of new classes of antimicrobial therapeutics. We have developed a library of antimicrobial polypeptides, prepared by the ring-opening polymerization of gamma-propargyl-L-glutamate N-carboxyanhydride and the alkyne-azide cycloaddition click reaction, which mimic the favorable characteristics of naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides (AmPs). AmPs are known not to cause drug resistance as well as prevent bacteria attachment on surfaces. The ease and scale of synthesis of the antimicrobial polypeptides developed here are significantly improved over the traditional Merrifield synthetic peptide approaches needed for naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides and avoids the unique challenges of biosynthetic pathways. The polypeptides range in length from 30 to 140 repeat units and can have varied side group functionality, including primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary amines with hydrocarbon side chains ranging from 1 to 12 carbons long. Overall, we find these polypeptides to exhibit broad-spectrum activity against both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, namely, S. aureus and E. coli , while having very low hemolytic activity. Many of the polypeptides can also be used as surface coatings to prevent bacterial attachment. The polypeptide library developed in this work addresses the need for effective biocompatible therapeutics for drug delivery and medical device coatings.
