This study was aimed to research the changes of the biological characteristics of Hepatitis B virus-resistant mutant model in vivo. The anti-ADV mutant HBV plasmid of rtA181V and rtN236T, prepared by Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit, was transferred into mice via the tail vein, and the levels of HBV-DNA replication were detected after Anti-HBV drugs treatment. The HBV-DNA replication had been detected in the mutant mice, which means that the establishment of HBV-resistance mutant model in vivo was successful, but the level of HBV DNA replication intermediates in the anti-ADV mutant mice liver were decreased compared with wild 4.1kb HBV plasmid mice. The wild-type mice were sensitive to Lamivudine, Adefovir dipivoxil and Entecavir. Though the mutant mice were also sensitive to Entecavir, the sensitivity to lamivudine and Adefovir dipivoxil decreased. As a result, this study established the Adefovir-resistant hepatitis B virus mouse model successfully. However, the replication level of HBV-DNA was reduced in this model, and Adefovir dipivoxil in the mutant mice had no significant inhibition effect on HBV-DNA.
