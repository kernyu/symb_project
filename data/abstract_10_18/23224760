The prevalence of HIV-1 infection in men who have sex with men (MSM) in China has drastically increased, and circulating strains may have acquired transmitted drug resistance (TDR). We determined TDR genotypes among antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive MSM in 19 provinces/cities where HIV-1 prevalence among MSM is high, and found an overall 4.9 % TDR rate. Although protease inhibitors (PI) were not in the first-line antiretroviral drug list provided through the National ART Program, 70.4 % of the detected TDR belongs to this category. Our findings confirm the urgent need for TDR surveillance in order to optimize treatment effects of the National ART Program.
