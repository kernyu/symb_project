The influence of agents modifying cholesterol in plasma membranes on the functional activity of transporter proteins (P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and the multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1)) in human lymphocytes has been studied. It was shown that changes in lateral distribution of cholesterol using the polyene antibiotic filipin, which disturb the structure and function of glycolipid microdomains in plasma membranes of lymphocytes lead to a decrease in the transport activity of both P-gp and MRP1. It was found that the treatment of human lymphocytes with the cyclic oligosaccharide methyl-beta-cyclodextrine, which leads to cholesterol depletion and reduction of lipid bilayer microviscosity in membranes of these cells, also decreases the functional activity of these proteins. It was concluded that the transport activity of P-gp and MRP1 depends on the modification of cholesterol in the membranes of human lymphocytes, i.e., is closely associated with the level of cholesterol and its lateral distribution.
