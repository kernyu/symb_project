All biotherapeutics have the potential to generate anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) in patients. The main factors leading to an immune response are thought to be product, treatment and patient related. In this review, reasons for the formation of ADAs, and particularly neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), are considered, with a focus on IFN-beta as a well-studied example. The time course for the production of NAbs, the measurement of NAbs, the defining of IFN-beta responders and non-responders, the implications for disease progression in patients, and future methods for avoiding the production of ADAs and of tolerizing patients are considered.
