BACKGROUND: Hospitals and other facilities utilize antibiograms as tools for optimal antibiotic selection. Currently, no measures compare broad trends on the regional level, despite interest for more comprehensive data, particularly for antibiotic-resistant ESKAPE organisms. OBJECTIVE: To collect and compare regional health-care facility antibiogram data for ESKAPE organisms to form a cumulative antibiogram. METHODS: Health-care facilities were identified using the publicly accessible Pennsylvania Department of Health web site. Facilities were contacted by phone from June 2015 to 2016 to ascertain participation/consent for the study. An electronic questionnaire ascertained baseline facility characteristics. Facilities provided quantitative antibiotic susceptibility data via antibiograms. Antibiogram data were synthesized as cumulative susceptibilities, stratified by urban/suburban versus rural location. RESULTS: Forty-five facilities were included in the study (n = 18 urban/suburban, n = 27 rural). The overall prevalence of methicillin-resistant S aureus was 41.5%, stratified at 40.6% and 43.3% in urban/suburban and rural facilities, respectively ( P < .001). Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus prevalence was 18.8% overall, with 27.7% in urban/suburban and 14.0% in rural facilities ( P < .001). Generally, lower susceptibility rates were found for high-utilization beta-lactams across gram-negative organisms in urban/suburban facilities. CONCLUSIONS: Development of a regional cumulative antibiogram that targets key ESKAPE pathogens is feasible, while observed trends may help aid future antimicrobial stewardship efforts.
