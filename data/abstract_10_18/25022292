INTRODUCTION: The present study is a retrospective analysis of a total of 36 cases of bacteriologically proven extra-intestinal salmonellosis, managed at Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, between 1987 and 2012 (25 years). The extra-intestinal sites involved were the skin, cerebrum, spleen, ovary, synovium, and the skeletal muscle. METHODOLOGY: The extra-intestinal specimens were first processed using standard methods. Colonies suspected as Salmonella were identified by standard laboratory methods, initially by manual biochemical reactions and later by the API system (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile- France) and the Vitek-2 system (bioMerieux). All the Salmonella isolates were sent to Central Research Institute, Kasauli, for serotyping. RESULTS: The predominant serotype isolated was Salmonella Typhi (S. Typhi) in 27 (75%) patients, followed by Salmonella Senftenberg (S. Senftenberg) in 5 (14%), Salmonella Paratyphi A (S. Paratyphi A) in 3 (8%), and Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) in 1 (3%). There was an increasing resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, cephalosporins (third generation), and quinolones over the 25 years. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of extra-intestinal salmonellosis requires a high degree of clinical suspicion and should be included in the differential diagnosis in patients with deep-seated abscesses.
