Malaria is one of the world's most deadly infectious diseases. Millions of lives are threatened by the continued development of resistance in the malaria parasite which is overcoming the effectiveness of current anti- malarial treatments. The scientific community is facing this challenge by developing new and superior therapies to combat, and potentially eradicate, this wide spread plague. New anti-Plasmodium agents derived from phe- notypic screening hits (e.g. spiroindolones) or from target based projects (e.g. DSM265) have recently entered into clinical development and hopefully will provide soon a new wave of antimalarial treatments.
