BACKGROUND: Data on ESBL carriage of healthy people including children are scarce especially in developing countries. We analyzed the prevalence and genotypes of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae (EPE) in Tanzanian street children with rare contact to healthcare facilities but significant interactions with the environment, animals and other people. METHODOLOGY/ PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: Between April and July 2015, stool samples of 107 street children, who live in urban Mwanza were analyzed for EPE. Intestinal carriage of EPE was found in 34 (31.8%, 95% CI; 22.7-40.3) children. Of the 36 isolates from 34 children, 30 (83.3%) were Escherichia coli (E. coli) and six Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae). Out of 36 isolates, 36 (100%), 35 (97%), 25 (69%) and 16 (44%) were resistant to tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin, respectively. Beta-lactamase genes and the multilocus sequence types of E. coli and K. pneumoniae were characterized. ESBL gene blaCTX-M-15 was detected in 75% (27/36) of ESBL isolates. Sequence types (STs) 131, 10, 448 and 617 were the most prevalent in E. coli. Use of local herbs (OR: 3.5, 95% CI: 1.51-8.08, P = 0.003) and spending day and night on streets (OR: 3.6, 95% CI: 1.44-8.97, P = 0.005) were independent predictors of ESBL carriage. CONCLUSIONS/ SIGNIFICANCE: We observed a high prevalence of blaCTX-M-15 in EPE collected from street children in Tanzania. Detection of E. coli STs 131, 10, 38 and 648, which have been observed worldwide in animals and people, highlights the need for multidisciplinary approaches to understand the epidemiology and drivers of antimicrobial resistance in low-income countries.
