In order to assess antimicrobial resistance in Listeria monocytogenes, 202 food and environmental isolates from 1996 to 2006 were tested. Only four strains displayed acquired resistance. Resistance to erythromycin, tetracycline-minocycline, and trimethoprim was evidenced, and the genes erm(B), tet(M), and dfrD, already found in L. monocytogenes, were detected.
