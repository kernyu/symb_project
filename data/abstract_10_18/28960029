Close contacts with infectious tuberculosis (TB) are persons at high risk for developing active disease. We preliminarily introduced submillisievert chest computed tomography (CT) scan (effective dose, 0.19-0.25 millisievert) in a contact investigation of multi-drug resistant (MDR)-TB. Baseline CT scan showed minimal nodules or branching opacities in two of six contacts. A two-month follow-up examination revealed a radiologic progression in contact 1, subsequently having the microbiologic diagnosis of MDR-TB at an asymptomatic early stage, whereas nodules transiently increased after 3 months in contact 2, followed by a decrease after one year. Contact 1 was cured after 1.5-year of anti-MDR-TB treatment. In conclusion, early identification of secondary MDR-TB is feasible with submillisievert chest CT scans in contact investigations of MDR-TB, minimizing of MDR-TB transmission and offering a favorable treatment outcome. This was a clinical trial study and was registered at www.ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT02454738).
