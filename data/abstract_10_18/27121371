BACKGROUND: The development of antibiotic resistance by bacteria is of global concern. Inappropriate prescribing has the potential to exacerbate this issue. We aimed to examine the patterns of prescribing of antimicrobial medicines by dental practitioners in Australia from 2001 to 2012. METHODS: Data were collected from Medicare Australia on prescriptions from dental practitioners dispensed to concessional beneficiaries between 2001 and 2012. We examined patterns of use over time. RESULTS: There was an overall increase in number of prescriptions and in dispensed use (standardized by dose and population) of antibiotics and antifungals for the concessional population over the 12-year period. The use of dentally prescribed antibiotics increased 50%. Amoxicillin was the most commonly prescribed antibiotic accounting for 66% of all prescriptions in 2012. Generally, there was preferential prescribing of the highest dose formulations. The use of the two antifungals increased 30% over the study period with a preference for amphotericin B (74%) rather than nystatin. CONCLUSIONS: These data show a concerning increase in prescribing of antibiotics and antifungals by dentists in Australia. It would appear that Australian dentists may not be prescribing these medicines appropriately; however, further research is needed to understand prescribing behaviours and decision-making by dentists.
