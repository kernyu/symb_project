Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii is an important bacterial pathogen commonly associated with hospital acquired infections. A. baumannii can remain viable and hence virulent in the environment for a long period of time due primarily to its ability to form biofilms. A total of 459 cases of MDR A. baumannii our hospital collected from March 2014 to March 2015 were examined in this study, and a representative isolate selected for high-throughput mRNA sequencing and comparison of gene expression profiles under the biofilm and exponential growth conditions. Our study found that the same bacteria indeed exhibited differential mRNA expression under different conditions. Compared to the rapidly growing bacteria, biofilm bacteria had 106 genes upregulated and 92 genes downregulated. Bioinformatics analyses suggested that many of these genes are involved in the formation and maintenance of biofilms, whose expression also depends on the environment and specific signaling pathways and transcription factors that are absent in the log phase bacteria. These differentially expressed mRNAs might contribute to A. baumannii's unique pathogenicity and ability to inflict chronic and recurrent infections.
