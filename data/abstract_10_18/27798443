PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to provide an update on the clinical, public health and economic consequences of Campylobacter infection. RECENT FINDINGS: Campylobacter is a leading bacterial cause of food-related illness. Its importance is enhanced by the chronic sequelae that can result from acute infection. Recent advances include a new clinical classification system for neurological sequelae with the aim of speeding accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment, a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying postinfectious functional gastrointestinal disorders, the emergence of Campylobacter concisus and Campylobacter showae as potential aetiological agents in inflammatory bowel disease, a new mechanism for antimicrobial resistance in campylobacters and a better appreciation of the economic costs. SUMMARY: Campylobacter infection is very common and can lead to serious chronic sequelae and considerable personal, healthcare and societal costs.
