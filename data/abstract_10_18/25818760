We evaluated the performance of two MALDI-TOF MS systems for the identification of clinically important Gram-positive cocci. Vitek MS and Microflex LT correctly identified 97.2% and 94.7%, respectively. Both systems offer reliable and rapid identification of clinically important Gram-positive cocci isolated in clinical laboratories, including staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci. Expanding the databases, especially of coagulase-negative staphylococci and viridans streptococci, would enhance performance.
