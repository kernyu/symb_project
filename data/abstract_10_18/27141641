Oligomycins and their complexes with lithium and zinc were shown to be less active vs. cyclosporin A in inhibition of transport proteins responsible for multiple drug resistance of lymphoid leukosis P388VR cells, while certain oligomycin complexes were tens or hundreds times more active than cyclosporin A by inhibition of transport proteins in another type of tumor cells, i.e. human larynx cancer Hep-2, that makes possible the use of the oligomycins complexes with lithium and zinc for inhibition of multiple drug resistance of certain tumor types.
