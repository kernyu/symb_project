INTRODUCTION: Rational use of antibiotics is an important tool in combating antibiotic resistance. AIM: The aim of the authors was to evaluate the quality of ambulatory antibiotic use in Hungary. METHOD: Crude antibiotic sales data for the period between 1996 and 2010 were converted into DDD (Defined Daily Dose) per 1000 inhabitants and per year. The recently developed and validated drug-specific quality indicators were used to evaluate antibiotic use. RESULTS: Beside constant quantity (18.0+/-1.8 DDD/1000 inhabitants/day), the authors detected major changes in the composition of antibiotic use. Ratios of the consumption of broad to narrow spectrum beta-lactams and macrolides increased eight-fold (1996: 2.2 vs. 2010: 15.8) and consumption of fluoroquinolones tripled. Out of the ten surveyed drug-specific quality indicators, Hungary belonged to the European elite in case of three, while considering the remaining seven, Hungary ranked among the weak or weakest European countries. CONCLUSION: In quantity Hungary an ambulatory antibiotic use resembles to Scandinavian countries while it mimics antibiotic consumption patterns of southern countries.
