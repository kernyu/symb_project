Rising rates of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens is a medical crisis of global concern that necessitates the development of new treatment strategies. We have isolated a natural product with macrophage-stimulating activity from a screen of microbially produced bioactive molecules. Streptazolin increased bacterial killing and elaboration of immunostimulatory cytokines by macrophages in vitro. Furthermore, we show that streptazolin stimulates the macrophage nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway via phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling, and that the conjugated diene moiety is essential for stimulatory activity. Immunostimulatory molecules like streptazolin represent entries into new treatment paradigms to address the challenge of antibiotic resistance.
