BACKGROUND: The incidence of fungal infections has increased significantly, contributing to morbidity andmortality. This is caused by an alarming increase in infections with multi-drug resistant bacteria leading to overuse of broad-spectrum antimicrobials, which lead to overgrowth of Candida, thus enhancing its opportunity to cause disease. Candida are major human fungal pathogens that cause both mucosal and deep tissue infections. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to identify the distribution of Candida species among clinical isolates and their sensitivity pattern for common antifungal drugs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred and thirty-sevendifferent clinical isolates of Candida were collected from patients visiting to a tertiary care centre of Indore from 2010 to 2012. Identification of Candida species as well antifungal sensitivity testing was performed with Vitek2 Compact (Biomerieux France) using ID-YST Kits. Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed with AST YS01 KitsonVitek2 Compact. RESULTS: We found that the non-albicans Candida were more prevalent than Candida albicans in paediatric (<3 year) and older (>60 year) patients than other age group (4-18, 19-60 years) patients and also in intensive care unit (ICU) patients as compared to out patient department (OPD) patients. Resistance rates for amphotericin B, fluconazole, flucytosine, itraconazole, and voriconazolewere 2.9%, 5.9%, 0.0%, 4.2% and 2.5%%, respectively. All the strains of C. krusei were found resistant to fluconazole with intermediate sensitivity to flucytosine. CONCLUSION: Species-level identification of Candidaand their antifungal sensitivity testing should be performed to achieve better clinical results.
