BACKGROUND: Non-typhoidal Salmonella is a common cause of infectious diarrhea in humans. Antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella has become a global concern. METHODS: Using laboratory-based surveillance system for Salmonella from September 2009 to December 2012 in Guangdong Province of China. The clinical information and samples of diarrhea patients were collected, according to the surveillance case definition. The lab tests were followed by standardized protocols, including sample isolation, isolates confirmation, serotyping, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST). RESULTS: A total of 1,826 Salmonella isolates were identified from40,572 patients in 28 hospitals in11 prefectures. The isolates ratio was highest in autumn (38.8%, 708/1826) and lowest in winter (6.4%, 117/1826). Children aged <5 years were the group most affected by Salmonella in Guangdong Province accounting for 73% (1,329/1,826), of whom the infants (<1 year) were 81.5% (1084/1329) especially. A total of 108 serotypes were identified among the isolates. S. Typhimurium represented the most common serotype followed by serotype 4,5,12:i:-. S. Typhimurium was also the common serotype followed by S. Enteritidis among infants and children aged 1-3 years old. However, S. Enteritidis became the common serotype followed by S. Typhimurium among children aged 3-5 and >5 years. Resistance to at least one antimicrobial was found in 72% (1321/1,826) of the isolates. Resistance to at least three antimicrobials was found in 46% (850/1,826) of the isolates. Resistance to all 12 antimicrobials screened was observed in 8 isolates (0.44%, 8/1,826). The resistant prevalence to quinolones including nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin was 61.9% (1131/1826), of which ciprofloxacin resistance rate was 8.05% (147/1826). The prevalence resistance to all three cephalosporin antimicrobials (cefepime, cefotaxime, and caftazidime) in <5 yr age group was accounted for 90% (89/99). CONCLUSIONS: Additional data and more refined methods can improve future surveillance. The invasive Salmonella isolates should also be included to the antibiotic resistance surveillance for clinical care or public health.
