Despite increasing interest in fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), its full therapeutic potential has yet to be determined. Since its increase in popularity, FMT has been shown to be highly effective in the treatment of both Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and its recurrent form. Interest in FMT now expands well beyond the treatment of CDI to other processes with known associations to the microbiota such as antibiotic resistant infections, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), hepatic encephalopathy, neuropsychiatric disorders, and metabolic disease. The rampant use and misuse of antibiotics in both medicine and agriculture has resulted in an increase in antibiotic resistant organisms which pose a significant risk to human health. The purpose of this commentary is to address the general issue of antibiotic resistance in the human microbiota and the restorative potential of FMT in this area.
