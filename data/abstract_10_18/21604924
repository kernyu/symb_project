INTRODUCTION: Pandemic influenza A (H1N1) may cause severe illness in pediatric patient with chronic lung disease. CASE REPORT: We describe the emergence of oseltamivir resistance in an immunocompetent child with status asthmaticus triggered by pandemic influenza A (H1N1). This case highlights the possible relationship between influenza viral load and risk of resistance emergence in children with asthma. Influenza vaccination should continue to be emphasized as the mainstay of prevention in children with chronic lung disease. CONCLUSION: Influenza virus can lead to severe status asthmaticus and can develop oseltamivir resistance in immunocompetent children.
