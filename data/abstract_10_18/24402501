OBJECTIVES: Previously described methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ST398 strains revealed a high frequency of phenotypic resistance to spectinomycin. However, only a few were found to carry the spc resistance determinant. The aim of this study was to identify the genetic mechanism of spectinomycin resistance among spc-negative MRSA ST398 strains. METHODS: Nine spectinomycin-resistant, but spc-negative, MRSA ST398 strains were analysed. The strains were screened for carriage of the spw gene and tested for the presence of transferrable spectinomycin resistance. Plasmid DNA was isolated from all strains and used in transformation assays. The plasmid identified as mediating resistance to spectinomycin was fully sequenced. The function of the novel spectinomycin resistance gene was confirmed by restriction digest inactivation and its distribution was determined using a PCR assay. RESULTS: A single MRSA ST398 strain was spw positive. The remaining strains carried a plasmid that mediated resistance to spectinomycin. Sequence analysis of a single plasmid, termed pDJ91S, revealed that it was 3928 bp in size and contained three open reading frames: a novel spectinomycin resistance gene, designated spd, as well as a repN gene and a rec gene. The XmnI digest inactivation of the spd gene resulted in a 4-fold decrease in spectinomycin MIC. The spd gene was detected in seven other spectinomycin-resistant MRSA ST398 strains that carried a plasmid comparable in size to pDJ91S. CONCLUSIONS: A novel gene, designated spd, that confers resistance to spectinomycin has been identified on a small plasmid in MRSA ST398.
