We report on the first detection of the NDM-1 carbapenemase in Italy, in Escherichia coli isolated in October 2009. Prolonged colonization and relapsing infection by NDM-1-positive E. coli were observed in a patient (index case) with an indirect epidemiological link with areas of endemicity. Transient colonization was apparently observed in another patient linked with the index case.
