Selection of appropriate bacterial strains is crucial for development of new probiotic preparations. The fundamental prerequisite for potential efficacy of a probiotic preparation for oral application is the selection of appropriate bacterial strains with good gastrointestinal colonisation abilities, antimicrobial activity, and tolerance of conditions in the gastrointestinal tract, resistance to different antimicrobial agents, survival during processing and storage. The strain should be genetically stable, it should have good growth properties, to maintain its high viability at processing and when in storage. Mostly, the properties of promising strains are tested in the first phase in vitro, and only the best ones undergo subsequent in vivo testing. in vitro tests are often performed by classical microbiological cultivation methods which are material and time consuming, and they are not able to distinguish between 'viable but nonculturable' and dead bacteria. Flow cytometry is usually used for counting, phenotyping or functional characterisation of immune cells. Nowadays, flow cytometry is increasingly used in microbiology for counting bacteria, determining their viability and metabolic activity, detecting specific strains or testing their adherence abilities. The utilisation of flow cytometry in combination with an appropriate fluorescent labelling represents an effective and rapid method for the selection of probiotic bacteria.
