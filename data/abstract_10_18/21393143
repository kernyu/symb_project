BACKGROUND: After 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) introduction, non-vaccine serotypes such as 19A are increasing among Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, only limited data on 19A S. pneumoniae are available in Asian countries. METHODS: Out of 1637 S. pneumoniae clinical pneumonia isolates collected during 2008 and 2009 from 10 Asian countries (Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong, India, Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam), 91 serotype 19A S. pneumoniae isolates were identified. Capsular swelling reaction identified serotype 19A isolates. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on the serotype 19A isolates using the broth microdilution method, and the genotypes of the isolates were assessed using multilocus sequence typing. RESULTS: Thirty different sequence types (STs) were identified. The most prevalent clone was ST320 (46 isolates, 51.1%). ST320 was found in Hong Kong, India, Korea, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and Taiwan. ST320 isolates were mostly multidrug resistant (MDR) and showed significantly higher resistance rates than other STs for cefuroxime, clindamycin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. CONCLUSIONS: Although diverse clones were identified among 19A S. pneumoniae isolates, MDR ST320 was the predominant clone in Asian countries. Its predominance, even in countries with no or low coverage of PCV7, may indicate that its emergence and dissemination was due to more than just vaccine selection pressure in Asian countries. A longitudinal investigation of the change of serotypes and genotypes since the introduction of PCV7 is required to understand the emergence and dissemination mechanisms of a certain clone of 19A S. pneumoniae isolates.
