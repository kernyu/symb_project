The co-occurrence of L1 and AmpR-L2 with bla(NDM-1) gene with an upstream 250-bp promoter was detected in a clinical isolate of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia DCPS-01, which was resistant to all beta-lactams and sensitive only to colistin and fluoroquinolones. To investigate expression of resistance genes and the molecular mechanisms of bacteria resistance to carbapenems, proteomic profiles of the isolate was passaged with and without the drug by using 2D-PAGE. The results showed that 33 genes exhibiting a >/=3-fold change were identified as candidates that may help S. maltophilia survive drug selection. Strikingly, L1 was expressed more highly in cells grown with imipenem, and the abundant NDM-1 further increased, while very little L2 was detected even following induction. Specific activities for beta-lactamase revealed that L2 remained at constitutive low levels (10.6 U/mg), while L1 and NDM-1 showed clear activity (69.8 U/mg). Our data support that imipenem could specifically and reversibly induce L1 and NDM-1, which together played key roles in drug resistance in DCPS-01. Although NDM-1 mediated resistance to carbapenems has been found in very few cases, to our knowledge, this is the first proteomics research of S. maltophilia with NDM-1, giving very broad-spectrum antibiotic resistance profiles.
