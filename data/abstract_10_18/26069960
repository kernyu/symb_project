A sensitive and noble amperometric horseradish peroxidase (HRP) biosensor is fabricated via the deposition of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) onto a three-dimensional (3D) porous carbonized chicken eggshell membrane (CESM). Due to the synergistic effects of the unique porous carbon architecture and well-distributed AuNPs, the enzyme-modified electrode shows an excellent electrochemical redox behavior. Compared with bare glass carbon electrode (GCE), the cathodic peak current of the enzymatic electrode increases 12.6 times at a formal potential of -100 mV (vs. SCE) and charge-transfer resistance decreases 62.8%. Additionally, the AuNPs-CESM electrode exhibits a good biocompatibility, which effectively retains its bioactivity with a surface coverage of HRP 6.39x10(-9) mol cm(-2) (752 times higher than the theoretical monolayer coverage of HRP). Furthermore, the HRP-AuNPs-CESM-GCE electrode, as a biosensor for H2O2 detection, has a good accuracy and high sensitivity with the linear range of 0.01-2.7 mM H2O2 and the detection limit of 3 muM H2O2 (S/N = 3).
