OBJECTIVE: To study the in vitro antituberculous activities of clofazimine (CLF) to different drug-resistant types of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. METHODS: The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of CLF and isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RFP), ofloxacin (OFLX), amikacin (AK), and capreomycin (CPM) against sensitive, single-drug resistant (SDR), poly-drug resistant (PDR), multi-drug resistant (MDR), and extensive-drug resistant (XDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains isolated clinically were determined by microplate assays. RESULTS: The MICs of CLF for sensitive, SDR, PDR, MDR and XDR strains of clinically isolated Mycobacterium tuberculosis were 0.06 - 4.00 mg/L, 0.03 - 4.00 mg/L, 0.06 - 8.00 mg/L, 0.06 - 8.00 mg/L, 0.03 - 8.00 mg/L. For the sensitive group, the MIC of CLF (0.06 - 4.00 mg/L) was higher than that of INH (0.06 - 0.25 mg/L) and RFP (0.06 - 0.25 mg/L), while there was no significant difference among OFLX (0.06 - 2.00 mg/L), AK (0.06 - 4.00 mg/L), and CPM (0.50 - 4.00 mg/L). For the single-drug resistant group, there was no significant difference among CLF (0.03 - 4.00 mg/L), INH (0.06 - 0.25 mg/L), and RFP (0.06 - 0.25 mg/L), but the MIC of CLF was lower than that of OFLX (0.25 - 8.00 mg/L), AK (0.06 - 4.00 mg/L), and CPM (0.50 - 8.00 mg/L). For the MDR group, there was no significant difference between CLF (0.06 - 8.00 mg/L) and AK (0.25 - 8.00 mg/L), but the MIC of CLF was lower than that of OFLX (0.125 - 8.00 mg/L) and CPM (0.50 - 8.00 mg/L). For the XDR group, the MIC of CLF (0.03 - 8.00 mg/L) was lower than that of others. CONCLUSION: CLF showed good in vitro activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, especially MDR and XDR strains.
