Background: Antimicrobial-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a major public health threat. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends ceftriaxone 250 mg plus azithromycin (AZM) 1 g for gonorrhea treatment. Resistance to AZM could affect gonorrhea control efforts. Methods: Using gonococcal isolates collected at the Public Health-Seattle & King County (PHSKC) Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Clinic from 2012 to 2016, focusing on 2014-2016, we compared cases with the CDC AZM alert value minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (>/=2 microg/mL) to those with AZM MIC </=1 microg/mL, antimicrobial susceptibility profiles and clinical outcomes. Results: In 2012 and 2013, none of the 263 patients from whom we isolated N. gonorrhoeae from the urethra were infected with organisms with an AZM MIC >/=2 microg/mL. Between 2014 and 2016, 4.4% of 926 gonorrhea cases demonstrated reduced susceptibility to AZM; 93% of these cases occurred among men who have sex with men (MSM). Among MSM, 5.0% of 2014-2016 cases demonstrated reduced susceptibility to AZM. No AZM alert value isolates had concomitant cephalosporin resistance. There were 2 potential treatment failures: 1 pharyngeal infection treated with AZM 2 g alone, and 1 pharyngeal infection that persisted after study drug. Conclusions: Among MSM with gonorrhea in Seattle, 5% have gonorrhea with reduced susceptibility to AZM. The World Health Organization recommends changing treatment guidelines when >5% of isolates are resistant to a recommended drug. The emergence of resistant AZM gonorrhea should prompt reconsideration of current treatment recommendations, and highlights the need for new therapies for gonorrhea.
