CONTEXT: Gonorrhoea is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections (STI) in developing countries and is a global health problem. AIMS: To analyze the trend of antimicrobial susceptibility of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates over the years, in a tertiary care hospital of North India. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: The study population comprised males with urethritis and females with endocervicitis attending STI clinic of our hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In our STI laboratory, all gonococcal isolates are subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing by disc diffusion method as per CLSI guidelines. beta-Lactamase production is determined by chromogenic cephalosporin test. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) for ceftriaxone is determined by E-test. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Data were expressed as percentages. The differences in percentages were tested for statistical significance by using chi2 test and P values were determined. RESULTS: The percentage of penicillinase producing N. gonorrhoeae (PPNG) increased from 8% in 1995-96 to 20% in 2004-05 and 88% in 2011-2013. Quinolone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae (QRNG) showed a significant increase from 12% in 1995-96 to 98.3% in 2004-05, while 84% isolates were found to be QRNG by 2011-2013. In January 2013 we detected our first gonococcal isolate with decreased susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporins; Ceftriaxone, Cefixime and Cefpodoxime (MIC for ceftriaxone = 0.19 mug/ml). CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study highlighted an alarming increase in the percentage of PPNG and QRNG strains over the years. Emergence of N. gonorrhoeae isolates with decreased susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporins is a cause of concern and thus emphasises the importance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
