Corynebacteria exist as part of human skin microbiota. However, under some circumstances, they can cause opportunistic infections. The subject of the study was to examine the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLSB) antibiotic resistance in 99 lipophilic strains of Corynebacterium genus isolated from the skin of healthy men. Over 70% of the tested strains were resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin. All of which demonstrated a constitutive type of MLSB resistance mechanism. In all strains, there were being investigated the erm(A), erm(B), erm(C), erm(X), lin(A), msr(A), and mph(C) genes that could be responsible for the different types of resistance to marcolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B. In all strains with the MLSB resistance phenotype, the erm(X) gene was detected. None of the other tested genes were discovered. Strains harboring the erm(X) gene were identified using a phenotypic method based on numerous biological and biochemical tests. Identification of the chosen strains was compared with the results of API Coryne, MALDI-TOF MS, and 16S rDNA sequencing methods. Only 7 out of the 23 investigated resistant strains provided successful results in all the used methods, showing that identification of this group of bacteria is still a great challenge. The MLSB resistance mechanism was common in most frequently isolated from healthy human skin Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum and Corynebacterium jeikeium strains. This represents a threat as these species are also commonly described as etiological factors of opportunistic infections.
