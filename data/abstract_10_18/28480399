BACKGROUND: Mastitis reduces milk yield and alters milk composition. Antibiotics are widely used in the treatment of the disease. However, this widespread use of antibiotics causes both antibiotic residues in milks and antibiotic resistance developed in bacteria. Today's researches are focused on discovering and using new antibiotics against bacteria. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to discover the antibacterial effects of Hypericum perforatum L. extracts against mastitis pathogens, and its other biological activities. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Kirby-Bauer assay was applied to the extracts. The other antibacterial activity was MIC for plant extracts. The non-enzymatic antioxidant activity was found using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate (DPPH). RESULTS: The extract was showed maximum inhibition zone against two bacteria (Coagulase-negative Staphylococci-33 and 37; CNS 33 and 37), and the zone was 17 mm. A bacterium (CNS - 22) showed the lowest sensitivity to 812.5 mug/mL concentration. In addition, the extract was tried against the stable DPPH for antioxidant activity. As a result, the extract showed a strength antioxidant activity. Trolox equivalent is 0.83 mM. CONCLUSION: The extract of Hypericum perforatum have antibacterial, antioxidant and antimutagenic potentials.
