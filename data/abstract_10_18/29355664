OBJECTIVE: To determine the occurrence of 16S rRNA mutations associated with low-level tetracycline resistance in H. pylori isolates from adult dyspeptic patients in South-west, Nigeria. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of fifty isolates was determined by E-test for tetracycline. The conserved region (535bp) of the H. pylori tetracycline binding sites of 16S rRNA was amplified by PCR, followed by sequencing and multiple sequence alignment of all the fifty clinical isolates studied. RESULTS: Out of 50 clinical isolates examined, DNA sequence analysis revealed nucleotide substitutions in seven isolates at positions 926-928. Of the seven isolates, two demonstrated reduced susceptibility to tetracycline at E-test MICs range 0.75-1.0mg/l while the other five isolates were resistant at MICs >1mg/l (break point of >1mg/l). The two isolates with reduced susceptibility had single nucleotide substitution of A926G while the five resistant isolates demonstrated double base pair substitutions of G927T/A928C, A926G/A928C and single nucleotide substitution of A926G. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that low-level tetracycline resistance amongst H. pylori positive dyspeptic patients is associated with reduced susceptibility and resistance to tetracycline. This is as a result of one and two bp differences in positions 926 and 926-928 respectively in the 16S rRNA of H. pylori.
