The role of salicylic acid (SA) as a possible signaling component in the case of the infection of plants with nematodes has been studied using a model system consisting of the tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum (Mill.) and race 1 of the gall eelworm Meloidogyne incognita (Kofoid and White, 1919; Chitwood, 1949). The pre-planting SA treatment of tomato seeds results in an increased nematode resistance of susceptible tomato cultivars; the protective effect is higher in the case of SA combined with chitosan, a biogenic elicitor of plant resistance. The studied preparations stimulate the growth and development of the plants. The increase in the resistance of tomato plants is related to the increased activity of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and an increased SA content in plant tissues infected with nematodes; both these factors significantly influence nematode development.
