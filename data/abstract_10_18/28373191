Neisseria gonorrhoeae resistance to ceftriaxone and azithromycin is increasing, which threatens the recommended dual therapy. We used molecular epidemiology to identify N. gonorrhoeae clusters and associations with azithromycin resistance in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. N. gonorrhoeae isolates (n = 143) were selected from patients visiting the Amsterdam STI Outpatient Clinic from January 2008 through September 2015. We included all 69 azithromycin-resistant isolates (MIC >/= 2.0 mg/liter) and 74 frequency-matched susceptible controls (MIC </= 0.25 mg/liter). The methods used were 23S rRNA and mtrR sequencing, N. gonorrhoeae multiantigen sequence typing (NG-MAST), N. gonorrhoeae multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (NG-MLVA), and a specific PCR to detect mosaic penA genes. A hierarchical cluster analysis of NG-MLVA related to resistance and epidemiological characteristics was performed. Azithromycin-resistant isolates had C2611T mutations in 23S rRNA (n = 62, 89.9%, P < 0.001) and were NG-MAST genogroup G2992 (P < 0.001), G5108 (P < 0.001), or G359 (P = 0.02) significantly more often than susceptible isolates and were more often part of NG-MLVA clusters (P < 0.001). Two resistant isolates (2.9%) had A2059G mutations, and five (7.3%) had wild-type 23S rRNA. No association between mtrR mutations and azithromycin resistance was found. Twenty-four isolates, including 10 azithromycin-resistant isolates, showed reduced susceptibility to extended-spectrum cephalosporins. Of these, five contained a penA mosaic gene. Four of the five NG-MLVA clusters contained resistant and susceptible isolates. Two clusters consisting mainly of resistant isolates included strains from men who have sex with men and from heterosexual males and females. The co-occurrence of resistant and susceptible strains in NG-MLVA clusters and the frequent occurrence of resistant strains outside of clusters suggest that azithromycin resistance develops independently from the background genome.
