Staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogen isolated from respiratory tract samples in cystic fibrosis (CF) cases. Rate of infection with S. aureus small-colony variants (SCVs) also is increasing in CF patients. In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence, antibiotic susceptibility and genotypic property of S. aureus SCVs in respiratory tract samples of CF patients admitted to Istanbul Faculty of Medicine Hospital, Turkey. Among 305 respiratory tract samples from 84 CF patients, normal S. aureus isolates were present in 71% of the CF patients and S. aureus SCVs in 21%. The highest antibiotic resistance was against penicillin (82%) followed by clarithromycin (21%) in S. aureus SCVs, while resistance to levofloxacin was low (2%) in normal S. aureus isolates but was 16% in S. aureus SCVs. No mecA and mecC were detected. The S. aureus strains constituted 24 different genotypes based on pulsed field gel-electrophoresis assay. The possible existence of S. aureus SCVs that are more resistant to antibiotis than normal S. aureus should be taken into considerstion when treating CF patients for this pernicious bacterial infection.
