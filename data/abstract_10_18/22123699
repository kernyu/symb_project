The clinical value of amphotericin B, the mainstay therapy for visceral leishmaniasis in sodium antimony gluconate-nonresponsive zones of Bihar, India, is now threatened by the emergence of acquired drug resistance, and a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms is the need of the hour. We have selected an amphotericin B-resistant clinical isolate which demonstrated 8-fold-higher 50% lethal doses (LD(50)) than an amphotericin B-sensitive strain to explore the mechanism of amphotericin B resistance. Fluorimetric analysis demonstrated lower anisotropy in the motion of the diphenylhexatriene fluorescent probe in the resistant strain, which indicated a higher fluidity of the membrane for the resistant strain than for the sensitive strain. The expression patterns of the two transcripts of S-adenosyl-l-methionine:C-24-Delta-sterol methyltransferase and the absence of ergosterol, replaced by cholesta-5,7,24-trien-3beta-ol in the membrane of the resistant parasite, indicate a decreased amphotericin B affinity, which is evidenced by decreased amphotericin B uptake. The expression level of MDR1 is found to be higher in the resistant strain, suggesting a higher rate of efflux of amphotericin B. The resistant parasite also possesses an upregulated tryparedoxin cascade and a more-reduced intracellular thiol level, which helps in better scavenging of reactive oxygen species produced by amphotericin B. The resistance to amphotericin B was partially reverted by the thiol metabolic pathway and ABC transporter inhibitors. Thus, it can be concluded that altered membrane composition, ATP-binding cassette transporters, and an upregulated thiol metabolic pathway have a role in conferring amphotericin B resistance in clinical isolates of Leishmania donovani.
