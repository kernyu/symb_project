In this work, smart near-infrared (NIR) light/H2O2-triggered and O2-evolving nanocomposites were designed and applied for efficient production of (1)O2 by converting a deeply penetrating NIR light into a visible light to excite the photosensitizers and achieve a self-sufficiency of the O2 generation in the photodynamic therapy process to overcome the hypoxia-induced drug resistance.
