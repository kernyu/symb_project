BACKGROUND: Tenofovir DF/FTC/rilpivirine (TDF/FTC/RPV) is a single tablet regimen considered as safe and efficacious in HIV population as long as food requirements, concomitant PPI administration, and compromised antiviral activity have been carefully reviewed. We evaluated TDF/FTC/RPV in a real-life setting with focus on clinical and virological outcomes. METHODS: OCEAN II is a prospective, two-centre observational study. From September 2012 to December 2013, antiretroviral-naive patients with HIV RNA <100,000 copies/mL or wishing to switch for simplification were considered for TDF/FTC/RPV. A systematic review of potential obstacles to TDF/FTC/RPV administration was undertaken during a multidisciplinary meeting, including DNA genotyping to detect archived RPV and/or NRTI-associated resistance mutations if historical RNA resistance testing was lacking. RESULTS: TDF/FTC/RPV was considered for 480 patients, however was not offered to 194 patients (40%), mainly because of risk of insufficient virological efficacy, issues on adherence, patient refusal, meal constraint, or PPI therapy. A total of 286 patients (269 in maintenance; 17 ART-naive) received TDF/FTC/RPV. After a median follow-up of 30 months, virological failure occurred in five patients (1.7%) without the emergence of resistance mutations. Discontinuation of TDF/FTC/RPV occurred in 98 patients, due to adverse events in 43 patients (44%) and non-safety reasons in 55 patients (56%). No grade three-fourth adverse events occurred. CONCLUSION: In this real-life experience, cohort consisting primarily of virologically suppressed patients, TDF/FTC/RPV usually maintained virologic suppression. Discontinuation of therapy because of intolerability was due to mild adverse events. Strict clinical and virological screening probably explained the low rate of virological failure.
