The RTA3 gene, coding for a member of the Rta1p-like lipid-translocating exporter family, is coordinately upregulated with the ATP-binding cassette transporter genes CDR1 and CDR2 in azole-resistant clinical isolates of Candida albicans that carry activating mutations in the transcription factor Tac1p. We show here that deleting RTA3 in an azole-resistant clinical isolate carrying a Tac1p-activating mutation lowered fluconazole resistance by 2-fold, while overexpressing RTA3 in an azole-susceptible clinical isolate resulted in enhanced fluconazole tolerance associated with trailing growth in a liquid microtiter plate assay. We also demonstrate that an Rta3p-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein localizes predominantly to the plasma membrane, consistent with a putative function for Rta3p as a lipid translocase.
