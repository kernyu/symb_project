GS-9620 [8-(3-(pyrrolidin-1-ylmethyl)benzyl)-4-amino-2-butoxy-7,8-dihydropteridin-6(5H)-o ne] is a potent, orally bioavailable small-molecule agonist of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) developed for finite treatment of chronic hepatitis B viral (HBV) infection, with the goal of inducing a liver-targeted antiviral effect without inducing the adverse effects associated with current systemic interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) therapies. We characterized the pharmacodynamic response of GS-9620 in CD-1 mice and cynomolgus monkeys following intravenous or oral administration and showed that GS-9620 induces the production of select chemokines and cytokines, including IFN-alpha and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). It is noteworthy that we also demonstrated that, in animals and healthy human volunteers, oral administration of GS-9620 can induce a type I interferon-dependent antiviral innate immune response, as measured by whole-blood mRNA of the ISGs 2'5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) and myxovirus resistance 1 (MX1), without the induction of detectable systemic IFN-alpha, i.e., a presystemic response. Additionally, presystemic induction of hepatic OAS1 and MX1 mRNA was observed in CD-1 mice in the absence of detectable systemic IFN-alpha. We propose that the mechanism of this presystemic response is likely its high intestinal absorption, which facilitates localized activation of TLR7, probably in plasmacytoid dendritic cells at the level of gut-associated lymphoid tissue and/or the liver. This localized response is further supported by data that indicate only minimal contributions of systemic immune stimulation to the overall pharmacodynamic response to orally administered GS-9620. These data demonstrate that GS-9620 can induce an antiviral innate immune response without inducing a systemic IFN-alpha response and thus suggest the therapeutic potential of this approach in the treatment of chronic HBV infection.
