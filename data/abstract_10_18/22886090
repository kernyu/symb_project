Procalcitonin (PCT)-guided antibiotic stewardship is a successful strategy to decrease antibiotic use. We assessed if clinical judgement affected compliance with a PCT-algorithm for antibiotic prescribing in a multicenter surveillance of patients with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). Initiation and duration of antibiotic therapy, adherence to a PCT algorithm and outcome were monitored in consecutive adults with LRTI who were enrolled in a prospective observational quality control. We correlated initial clinical judgment of the treating physician with algorithm compliance and assessed the influence of PCT on the final decision to initiate antibiotic therapy. PCT levels correlated with physicians' estimates of the likelihood of bacterial infection (p for trend <0.02). PCT influenced the post-test probability of antibiotic initiation with a greater effect in patients with non-pneumonia LRTI (e.g., for bronchitis: -23 % if PCT </= 0.25 mug/L and +31 % if PCT > 0.25 mug/L), in European centers (e.g., in France -22 % if PCT </= 0.25 mug/L and +13 % if PCT > 0.25 mug/L) and in centers, which had previous experience with the PCT-algorithm (-16 % if PCT </= 0.25 mug/L and +19 % if PCT > 0.25 mug/L). Algorithm non-compliance, i.e. antibiotic prescribing despite low PCT-levels, was independently predicted by the likelihood of a bacterial infection as judged by the treating physician. Compliance was significantly associated with identification of a bacterial etiology (p = 0.01). Compliance with PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship was affected by geographically and culturally-influenced subjective clinical judgment. Initiation of antibiotic therapy was altered by PCT levels. Differential compliance with antibiotic stewardship efforts contributes to geographical differences in antibiotic prescribing habits and potentially influences antibiotic resistance rates.
