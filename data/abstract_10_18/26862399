Carbapenem resistance, mainly among Gram-negative pathogens, is an ongoing public-health problem of global dimensions. This type of antimicrobial resistance, especially when mediated by transferable carbapenemase-encoding genes, is spreading rapidly causing serious outbreaks and dramatically limiting treatment options. In this article, important key points related to carbapenem resistance are reviewed and future perspectives are discussed.
