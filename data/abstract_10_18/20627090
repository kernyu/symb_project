Information on the immune response against H5N1 within the lung is lacking. Here we describe the sustained antiviral immune responses, as indicated by the expression of MxA protein and IFN-alpha mRNA, in autopsy lung tissue from an H5N1-infected patient. H5N1 infection of primary bronchial/tracheal epithelial cells and lung microvascular endothelial cells induced IP-10, and also up-regulated the retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I). Down-regulation of RIG-I gene expression decreased IP-10 response. Co-culturing of H5N1-infected pulmonary cells with TNF-alpha led to synergistically enhanced production of IP-10. In the absence of viral infection, TNF-alpha and IFN-alpha also synergistically enhanced IP-10 response. Methylprednisolone showed only a partial inhibitory effect on this chemokine response. Our findings strongly suggest that both the H5N1 virus and the locally produced antiviral cytokines; IFN-alpha and TNF-alpha may have an important role in inducing IP-10 hyperresponse, leading to inflammatory damage in infected lung.
