Analogs of (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxycytidine (BrVdCyd) (1) by substitution at N(4) were synthesized to impart resistance against deamination. The anti-HSV-1 activity and solution conformation of these analogs were determined. N(4)-Acetyl-BrVdCyd (2) was a potent inhibitor of HSV-1 replication whereas N(4)-propanoyl-BrVdCyd (3) had good activity and N(4)-Butanoyl-BrVdCyd (4) had only low activity against HSV-1 replication. N(4)-Methyl-BrVdCyd (5) was devoid of activity against HSV-1.
