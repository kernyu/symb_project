The aim of this study was to analyze the drug resistance of Ureaplasma urealyticum (Uu) and Mycoplasma hominis (Mh) in female reproductive track from 2007 to 2011 in Hangzhou. Antibiotics sensitivity test in Mycoplasma, which was isolated in clinics from 2007 to 2011 were analyzed retrospectively. The detection of Mycoplasma during 2007-2011 was 20,146 (54.37 %), of which the single infection rate of Uu was 42.08 %, of Mh 1.26 %, and of Uu+Mh was 11.02 %. The drug resistance rate of Uu was increased significantly in ofloxacin in 2007 (41.80 %), 2008 (45.94 %), 2009 (46.07 %), 2010 (50.36 %), and 2011 (53.22 %) (P < 0.05). The resistance rate to ciprofloxacin was significantly increased in 2007 (67.15 %), 2008 (67.44 %), 2009 (73.00 %), 2010 (75.28 %), and 2011 (75.28 %) (P < 0.05). Exceptionally, the resistance rates of the other antibiotics were low. The drug resistance rate of Uu was significantly increased with quinolones at increasing tendency. It is necessary to monitor the local drug resistance rate of Uu regularly to provide reasonable guidelines in clinics.
