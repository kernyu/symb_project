OBJECTIVE: To present survival rates of high-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) (FIGO score > 7) patients treated between 1995 and 2010 in the U.K. Death due to GTN is largely confined to patients with high-risk disease. In the U.K. a national system ensures that all patients are treated at only 2 specialist centers: Charing Cross Hospital (CXH) in London and Weston Park Hospital (WPH) in Sheffield. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 196 high-risk patients were identified using the CXH and WPH GTN databases, based on the risk score at the time of presentation. RESULTS: In all, 140 CXH and 56 WPH high-risk patients were treated with EMA/CO (etoposide, methotrexate, actinomycin D alternating with cyclophosphamide and vincristine) and MEA (methotrexate, etoposide, actinomycin D), respectively. The FIGO score at presentation ranged from 6-23. Eight patients (7from WPH and 1 from CXH) who were treated prior to 2002 as high-risk based on their pre-2002 scoring scored a 6 using FIGO 2002. Two (1%) patients died within 4 weeks of starting treatment (early death), 12 (6%) relapsed, and 9 patients subsequently died due to drug resistance. The overall survival was 94%, with a median follow-up of 4.69 years. CONCLUSION: In the context of a national trophoblastic disease service, patients with high-risk GTN have an excellent prognosis with EMA/CO or MEA.
