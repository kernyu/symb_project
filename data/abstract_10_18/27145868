BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance due to the presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) among Enterobacteriaceae is a worldwide problem. Data from Ghana regarding this resistance mechanism is limited. This study was designed to investigate the presence of TEM-type ESBL genes, their locations and their conjugabilities in clinical isolates of enterobacteria collected from the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital in Ghana. METHODS: Study isolates were characterized with respect to ESBL phenotype, TEM-type ESBL gene detection, location of the ESBL gene(s) and conjugability of the ESBL phenotype using nalidixic acid-resistant Escherichia coli K-12 as recipient. Phenotyping was by Kirby Bauer disk diffusion using cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, cefotaxime and their combinations with clavulanate. Gene detections were by PCR using blaTEM primers. RESULTS: Overall, 37.96 % of 137 clinical isolates showed ESBL phenotype. The ESBLs occurred mostly in Klebsiella spp. (42.3 %) and then Escherichia coli (34.6 %). The TEM gene was detected in 48.1 % of ESBL-positive isolates and was determined to be plasmid-borne in 24 of 25 blaTEM detections. Overall, 62.7 % of TEM-producing isolates transferred the ESBL phenotype by conjugation. CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the presence of TEM-type ESBLs in the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital and show considerable risk of environmental contamination through the urine of infected persons. An inhibition zone chart was generated which indicates the possible presence of complex beta-lactamase types. The data points to the fact that the ESBL-producing bacteria may disseminate this resistance mechanism via conjugation.
