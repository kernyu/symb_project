The following transformation protocol is based on homologous recombination that occurs between a gene disruption or gene replacement construct and a target gene of Coccidioides. The DNA constructs employed contain either the gene that encodes for hygromycin B or phleomycin resistance, which are present in the pAN7.1 or pAN8.1 plasmid vectors, respectively. Hygromycin B or phleomycin are used to select for transformants at concentrations that inhibit growth of the parental strain. Coccidioides protoplasts generated from germinated arthroconidia are used for the transformation experiments. The plasmid DNA constructs are taken up by the protoplasts in the presence of calcium and polyethylene glycol. Twenty to 100 transformants/mug DNA can be obtained in each transformation experiment. Approximately 5-10% of the transformation events are homologous recombinations. Coccidioides cells in all developmental stages, including arthroconidia, are multinucleate. Since all Coccidioides nuclei are haploid, only one run of transformation is sufficient to create a mutant strain. However, the transformed protoplasts develop into heterokaryotic cells that typically contain both the parental and mutated nuclei. To isolate a homokaryotic strain, we perform multiple subcultures of the single colonies which contain heterokaryotic cells on selection plates with hygromycin B or phleomycin to enrich for the mutated nuclei. Homokaryotic mutants can be obtained after three to four subcultures of isolated colonies. In this protocol, we describe the methodology for preparation of Coccidioides protoplasts, transformation and isolation of homokaryotic mutants.
