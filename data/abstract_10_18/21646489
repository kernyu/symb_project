The susceptibilities of vertilmicin and seven reference aminoglycosides to modifications by six recombinant aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, AAC(6')-Ie, APH(2'')-Ia, AAC(6')-Ie-APH(2'')-Ia, ANT(2'')-Ia, AAC(6')-Ib, and AAC(6')-Ib-cr, were studied by coupled spectrophotometric assays in microtiter plates. In comparison to other aminoglycosides, the susceptibility of vertilmicin was 45.8- to 250.0-fold lower for AAC(6')-Ie acetylation, 39.2- to 116.7-fold lower for AAC(6')-Ie-APH(2'')-Ia acetylation, and 1.8- to 7.5-fold lower for ANT(2'')-Ia adenylation (except that shown by amikacin) while relatively comparable for AAC(6')-Ib acetylation, AAC(6')-Ib-cr acetylation, APH(2'')-Ia phosphorylation, and AAC(6')-Ie-APH(2'')-Ia phosphorylation.
