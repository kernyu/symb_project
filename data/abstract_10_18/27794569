BACKGROUND: Topical antimicrobial formulations containing neomycin are commonly used to prevent and treat burn infections. However, Pseudomonas aeruginosa shows rapid acquisition of adaptive resistance to neomycin. This study aimed to evaluate the survival of P. aeruginosa during exposure to neomycin at high concentrations comparable to those used in topical formulations, and to investigate the effect of adaptive resistance to neomycin on the susceptibility to other aminoglycosides. METHODS: Strain IID1130 [neomycin minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 4 microg/ml] was incubated on an agar medium containing neomycin at high concentrations (8-4,096 microg/ml), and growing colonies were macroscopically observed. Acquisition of adaptive resistance was examined for 5 P. aeruginosa strains. Cells were sequentially passaged on agar medium containing neomycin with step-wise increased concentrations (8-2,048 microg/ml). To assess reversion of antibiotic susceptibility, the resulting colonies were repeatedly subcultured on antibiotic-free agar plates. RESULTS: Growing IID1130 colonies were macroscopically detected on a neomycin-containing (2,048 microg/ml) agar plate for 48 h. These cells showed increasing MIC for not only neomycin, but also gentamicin and amikacin; the MIC values were occasionally higher than the breakpoints. When the adapted cells were subcultured on antibiotic-free agar, several passages were required for reversion of susceptibility. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that P. aeruginosa can survive in the presence of neomycin with a concentration typically used in topical dosage forms, and that the acquired adaptive resistance is persistent and is accompanied by cross-resistance to other aminoglycosides.
