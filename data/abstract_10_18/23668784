In yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the immunosuppressant rapamycin mimics starvation by inhibiting the kinase Tor1. We recently documented that this treatment triggers a rapid degradation of Sgs1, a helicase involved in several biological processes such as the prevention of genomic instability. Herein, we show that yeast strains deleted for genes ATG2, ATG9, and PEP4, encoding components of the autophagy pathway, prevent rapamycin-induced degradation of Sgs1. We propose that defects in the autophagy pathway prevent degradation of key proteins in the rapamycin response pathway and as a consequence cause resistance to the drug.
