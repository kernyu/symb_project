Empirical antibiotic therapy in seriously ill patients requires careful selection of antibiotics. This study was planned to determine the pattern of bacterial infections and culture sensitivities in patients admitted to a medical intensive care unit (ICU). Patients with positive bacterial cultures from specimens of blood, urine, endo-tracheal tube, suction catheter, and tracheal aspirates were included. Data regarding microbial isolates and their culture sensitivities was collected. Escherichia coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aerogenosa (PA), Klebsiella pneumonea (KP), Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were the most frequently isolated bacteria. E coli showed 100% sensitivity to sulbactam potentiated sulfoperazone, and meropenam. PA were sensitive to gentamycin, imepenam, and sparfloxacin in > 70% cases. All KP isolates were sensitive to amikacin, imepenam and sparfloxacin. SA were 100% sensitive to amikacin. MRSA were 100% sensitive to vancomycine and linezolid. Based on these results, sulbactam potentiated cefoperazone in combination with amikacin seems the best empirical antibiotic regimen. Imipenam usage can be an alternative.
