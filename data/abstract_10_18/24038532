Triclosan (5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol) is an antimicrobial found in consumer soaps and toothpaste. It is in treated wastewater effluents at low parts-per-billion concentrations, representing a potentially chronic exposure condition for biota inhabiting receiving streams. For the present study, a naturally colonized benthos was created using flow-through indoor mesocosms; then, the benthic communities were dosed to achieve different in-stream triclosan concentrations (control, 0.1 mug/L, 0.5 mug/L, 1.0 mug/L, 5.0 mug/L, and 10 mug/L) for 56 d. Water quality parameters and endpoints from bacteria to macroinvertebrates, as well as interacting abiotic components, were measured. Effects of triclosan on specific microbial endpoints were observed at all doses, including an effect on litter decomposition dynamics at doses of 1.0 mug/L and higher. Resistance of periphytic bacteria to triclosan significantly increased at doses of 0.5 mug/L and above. By the end of dosing, the antimicrobial appeared to stimulate the stream periphyton at the 3 lowest doses, while the 2 highest doses exhibited decreased stocks of periphyton, including significantly lower bacteria cell densities and cyanobacteria abundance compared with the control. Other than an effect on benthic ostracods, the changes that occurred in the periphyton did not translate to significant change in the colonizing nematodes, the macroinvertebrate community as a whole, or other measurements of stream function. The results shed light on the role a low, chronic exposure to triclosan may play in effluent-dominated streams.
