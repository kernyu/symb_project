Meropenem-susceptible and -resistant Aeromonas dhakensis isolates from blood cultures of a fatal case of septicemia were analyzed. The two isolates were homologous and gene expression of metallo-beta-lactamase in the resistant strain was upregulated. Physicians should be aware of the possibility of the induction of carbapenem-resistance, following the use of carbapenems in the treatment of Aeromonas infection.
