It is well known that chronic hepatitis B plays a detrimental role on survival in patients on long-term dialysis and after kidney transplantation. The advent of nucleos(t)ide analogues offers the opportunity to change the natural history of hepatitis B in patients with chronic kidney disease. We report our experience on lamivudine use in two patients with HBV-related liver disease on long-term dialysis. At the beginning, both the patients were HBsAg positive and HBeAg positive with high viral load; after long-term lamivudine therapy, clearance of HBV viremia from serum was observed in both. Raised aminotransferase levels fell into the normal range and one patient experienced clearance of HBsAg by anti-HBV therapy. Tolerance to lamivudine was satisfactory and lamivudine resistance was not detected. Information on antiviral therapy with lamivudine in HBsAg positive patients on regular dialysis is extremely limited; we identified by an extensive review of the literature five studies with a total of 38 unique patients, most of them being renal transplant candidates. Lamivudine proved to be effective as the clearance of HBV viraemia from serum ranged between 56% and 100% ; the clearance of HBeAg from serum was less evident (between 37.5% and 100%). No significant side-effects due to lamivudine were observed and emergence of lamivudine-resistant strains was observed in two (5%) patients. Only a minority of patients experienced HBsAg loss (13%). We conclude that anti-HBV treatment with a nucleoside analogue such as lamivudine gives satisfactory results in some patients on long-term dialysis. Clinical trials are in progress to assess efficacy and safety of last-generation nucleos(t)ide analogues for anti-HBV therapy in dialysis population.
