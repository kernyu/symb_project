OBJECTIVES: Hepcidin is considered a major regulator of iron metabolism. Despite previous studies showing elevated ferritin and hepcidin levels in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), no study has investigated hepcidin levels in pregnant women with gestational DM (GDM). METHODS: A case-control study was conducted in 30 cases of GDM, 47 pregnant women with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and 72 pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance (control) between April 2009 and July 2011. Serum hepcidin and other iron metabolism parameters were analyzed in all groups. RESULTS: Serum ferritin and serum iron were significantly elevated in the GDM group compared to controls (p = 0.014, p = 0.018, respectively) and to the IGT group (p = 0.021, p = 0.008, respectively). Hepcidin levels were elevated significantly in the diabetic patients compared to the IGT group (p = 0.011) and controls (p = 0.002). We found no correlation between hepcidin and other iron metabolism parameters (Hb, serum iron and ferritin), whereas positive correlations were found between hepcidin and parameters of glucose metabolism (fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin level and glucose value response to glucose challenge test). CONCLUSIONS: Serum hepcidin concentrations were increased in pregnant women with IGT and GDM and this was not related to inflammation parameters.
