Amantadine resistance among influenza A viruses was investigated in South Korea in 2005-2010. Of 308 influenza A viruses examined, 229 had the S31N substitution in the M2 protein. The frequency of amantadine resistance was 30 %, 100 %, and 76 % in influenza A/H1N1, pandemic A/H1N1 2009(A/H1N1pdm), and A/H3N2 subtypes, respectively. The amantadine-resistant influenza A/H1N1pdm and A/H3N2 viruses were circulating continuously from 2008 to 2009 and from 2005 to 2006, respectively. Amantadine resistance among influenza A viruses increased dramatically during the 5-year study period, and this has diminished the usefulness of this class of drugs.
