An Ambler class A beta-lactamase gene, bla(CIA-1), was cloned from the reference strain Chryseobacterium indologenes ATCC 29897 and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21. The bla(CIA-1) gene encodes a novel extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) that shared 68% and 60% identities with the CGA-1 and CME-1 beta-lactamases, respectively. bla(CIA-1)-like genes were detected from clinical isolates. In addition to the metallo-beta-lactamase IND of Ambler class B, C. indologenes has a class A ESBL gene, bla(CIA-1), located on the chromosome.
