The spread of multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae related to the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) and carbapenemases is a serious public health problem worldwide. Microbiological diagnosis and therapy of these infections are challenging and controversial. After the selection of clinically relevant questions, this document provides evidence-based recommendations for the use of microbiological techniques for the detection of ESBL- and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, and for antibiotic therapy for invasive infections caused by these organisms. The absence of randomized-controlled trials is noteworthy, thus recommendations are mainly based on observational studies, that have important methodological limitations, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics models, and data from animal studies. Additionally, areas for future research were identified.
