BACKGROUND: The resistance profiles for patients on first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens after viremia have not been well studied in community clinic settings in the modern treatment era. OBJECTIVE: To determine time to viremia and the ART resistance profiles of viremic patients. METHODS: HIV-positive patients aged >/=16 years initiating a three-drug regimen were retrospectively identified from 01/01/06 to 12/31/12. The regimens were a backbone of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and a third agent: a protease inhibitor (PI), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), or an integrase inhibitor (II). Time to viremia was compared using a proportional hazards model, adjusting for demographic and clinical factors. Resistance profiles were described in those with baseline and follow-up genotypes. RESULTS: For 653 patients, distribution of third-agent use and viremia was: 244 (37%) on PIs with 80 viremia, 364 (56%) on NNRTIs with 84 viremia, and 45 (7%) on II with 11 viremia. Only for NNRTIs, time to viremia was longer than PIs (p = 0.04) for patients with a CD4 count >/=200 cells/mm(3). Of the 175 with viremia, 143 (82%) had baseline and 37 (21%) had follow-up genotype. Upon viremia, emerging ART resistance was rare. One new NNRTI (Y181C) mutation was identified and three patients taking PI-based regimens developed NRTI mutations (M184 V, M184I, and T215Y). CONCLUSIONS: Time to viremia for NNRTIs was longer than PIs. With viremia, ART resistance rarely developed without PI or II mutations, but with a few NRTI mutations in those taking PI-based regimens, and NNRTI mutations in those taking NNRTI-based regimens.
