Human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs, or neutrophils) are the most abundant innate immune cell and kill most invading bacteria through combined activities of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antimicrobial granule constituents. Pathogens such as Yersinia pestis resist destruction by the innate immune system and are able to survive in macrophages and neutrophils. The specific molecular mechanisms used by Y. pestis to survive following phagocytosis by human PMNs are incompletely defined. To gain insight into factors that govern Y. pestis intracellular survival in neutrophils, we inactivated 25 two-component gene regulatory systems (TCSs) with known or inferred function and assessed susceptibility of these mutant strains to human PMN granule extracts. Y. pestis strains deficient for PhoPQ, KdpED, CheY, CvgSY, and CpxRA TCSs were selected for further analysis, and all five strains were altered for survival following interaction with PMNs. Of these five strains, only Y. pestis DeltaphoPQ demonstrated global sensitivity to a panel of seven individual neutrophil antimicrobial peptides and serine proteases. Notably, Y. pestis DeltaphoPQ was deficient for intracellular survival in PMNs. Iterative analysis with Y. pestis strains lacking the PhoP-regulated genes ugd and pmrK indicated that the mechanism most likely responsible for increased resistance to killing is 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose modification of lipid A. Together, the data provide new information about Y. pestis evasion of the innate immune system.
