The putative zinc exporters ZntA (a P1B-type ATPase) and ZntB (2-TM-GxN family) in Agrobacterium tumefaciens were characterized. The expression of the zntA gene is inducible by CdCl2, ZnCl2 and CoCl2, of which CdCl2 is the most potent inducer, whereas zntB is constitutively expressed. The metal-induced expression of zntA is controlled by the MerR-like regulator ZntR. The zntA and zntR mutants were highly sensitive to CdCl2 and ZnCl2, and CoCl2 sensitivity was demonstrated to a lesser extent. By contrast, the zntB mutant showed similar levels of metal resistance to the WT strain. Even in the zntA mutant background, zntB did not play an apparent role in metal resistance under the conditions tested. The inactivation of zntA increased the accumulation of intracellular cadmium and zinc, and conferred hyper-resistance to H2O2. Thus, the metal transporter ZntA and its regulator ZntR are important for controlling zinc homeostasis and cadmium and cobalt detoxification. The loss of either the zntA or zntR gene did not affect the virulence of A. tumefaciens in Nicotiana benthamiana.
