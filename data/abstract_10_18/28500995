A new series of pyrimidine derivatives 5, 9a-d and 12a-d was synthesized by an efficient procedure. The antibacterial activity of the new compounds was studied against four bacterial strains. Compound 5 was found to exhibit the highest potency, with = 1.0 mug/ml, against both Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa when compared with amoxicillin (MIC = 1.0-1.5 mug/mL). Transmission electron microscope results confirmed that activities against bacteria occurred via rupturing of the cell wall. Molecular modeling results suggested that compounds 5, 9a-d and 12a-d have the potential to irreversibly bind to the penicillin-binding protein (PBP) Ser62 residue in the active site and were able to overcome amoxicillin resistance in bacteria by inhibiting the beta-lactamase enzyme. Docking studies showed that compounds 5, 9a-d and 12a-d inhibit the beta-lactamase enzyme through covalent bonding with Ser70. The synergistic effect with amoxicillin was studied. The newly synthesized compounds reported in this study warrant further consideration as prospective antimicrobial agents.
