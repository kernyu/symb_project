The dynamics of expression of two homologous genes Mi-1.1 and Mi-1.2 in the roots of resistant and susceptible tomato plants in non-invasion conditions and during invasion with the root-knot nematode M. incognita was studied. Nematode invasion was accompanied by a significant increase in the expression level of both genes; however, the accumulation of transcripts at the early stages of nematode invasion in the penetration of nematode juveniles to the roots was observed only in plants that contained the Mi-1.2 gene, which explains the resistance of tomatoes to this root-knot nematode, caused by only this gene. We reveal a change in the Mi-1 gene activity under exogenous salicylic acid treatment, which contributed to the formation of induced resistance to root-knot nematode in the susceptible plants.
