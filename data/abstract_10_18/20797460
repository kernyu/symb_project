Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disorder in which lymphocytic infiltration mediated mainly by pro-inflammatory cytokines. In this study, we examined the effect of combined exercise training on the levels of IFN-gamma, IL-4 and IL-17 in the plasma and the supernatant of peripheral blood lymphocytes in women with multiple sclerosis. Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), VO(2)max, muscle strength, and balance tests were obtained at baseline and post-treatment follow-up. Combined exercises training was designed for 24 sessions during 8 weeks. Each session was started with 5 min warm-up and was followed by 10 min stretch training, 20 min aerobic exercises and 20 min resistance-endurance training. The disability score was significantly decreased in test MS subjects after 8 weeks combined exercise training. Muscle strength and balance were increased significantly after the training program in test group. In this study, plasma, and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) IL-17 and IFN-gamma production was significantly decreased after 8 weeks combined training. Our findings suggest that combined training has useful anti-inflammatory effects by decrease in PBMC and plasma IL-17 production.
