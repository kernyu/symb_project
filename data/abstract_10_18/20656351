PURPOSE: To determine the baseline antibiotic susceptibility patterns of conjunctival and nasopharyngeal flora isolated from patients undergoing intravitreal (IVT) injections for choroidal neovascularization (CNV). DESIGN: Prospective, observational study. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-eight eyes of 24 patients undergoing unilateral IVT injections for CNV. METHODS: Bilateral conjunctival and unilateral nasopharyngeal cultures on the treatment side were taken before application of any topical medications. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Bacterial isolates were identified and tested for antibiotic susceptibility to 16 different antibiotics using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion technique. RESULTS: A total of 57 bacterial isolates were obtained from the conjunctiva of 48 eyes. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) accounted for 37 of the 57 isolates (65%). The most common CNS organisms were Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus lugdunensis accounting for 73% and 11% of CNS isolates, respectively. More than half of S. epidermidis isolates demonstrated some level of resistance to ofloxacin and levofloxacin, and 33% and 37% of isolates showed some level of resistance against gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin, respectively. Some 60% and 30% of CNS isolates were resistant to >/= 3 and >/= 5 antibiotics, respectively. Among the 24 nasopharyngeal cultures, 8 (33%) grew Staphylococcus aureus, and 1 of the 8 isolates (13%) was resistant to all penicillin, cephalosporin, macrolide, and fluoroquinolone antibiotics tested. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate subtantial levels of resistance to third- and fourth-generation fluoroquinolones and multiresistance among ocular CNS isolated from patients undergoing IVT injections for CNV.
