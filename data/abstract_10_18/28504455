Erythromycin, tylosin and tilmicosin are approved for use in cattle in Japan, the latter two being used to treat Mycoplasma bovis infection. In this study, 58 M. bovis isolates obtained from Japanese dairy calves all exhibited reduced susceptibility to these macrolides, this widespread reduced susceptibility being attributable to a few dominant lineages. All 58 isolates contained the G748A variant in both the rrl3 and rrl4 alleles of 23S rRNA, whereas a reference strain (PG45) did not. G748 localizes in the central loop of domain II (from C744 to A753) of 23S rRNA, which participates in binding to mycinose, a sugar residue present in both tylosin and tilmicosin. A number of in vitro-selected mutants derived from M. bovis PG45 showed reduced susceptibility to tylosin and tilmicosin and contained a nucleotide insertion within the central loop of domain II of rrl3 (U747-G748Ins_CU/GU or A743-U744Ins_UA), suggesting that mutations around G748 confer this reduced susceptibility phenotype. However, other Mycoplasma species containing G748A were susceptible to tylosin and tilmicosin. Sequence comparison with Escherichia coli revealed that M. bovis PG45 and isolates harbored five nucleotide alterations (U744C, G745A, U746C, A752C and A753G) in the central loop of domain II of 23S rRNA, whereas other Mycoplasma species lacked at least two of these five nucleotide alterations. It was therefore concluded that G748 mutations in combination with species-specific nucleotide alterations in the central loop of domain II of 23S rRNA are likely sufficient to reduce susceptibility of M. bovis to tylosin and tilmicosin.
