A series of novel benzimidazolyl tetrahydroprotoberberines were conveniently designed and efficiently synthesized from berberine via direct cyclization of tetrahydroprotoberberine aldehyde and o-phenylene diamines under metal-free aerobic oxidation. All the new compounds were characterized by IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and HRMS spectra. The antimicrobial evaluation revealed that the 5-fluorobenzimidazolyl derivative 5b was the most active antibacterial and antifungal molecule with broad spectrum in comparison to Berberine, Chloromycin, Norfloxacin and Fluconazole. It triggered almost no resistance development against MRSA even after 15 passages. Further studies demonstrated that compound 5b could not only effectively interact with Topo IA by hydrogen bonds, but also intercalate into calf thymus DNA and cleave pBR322 DNA, which might be responsible for its powerful bioactivities.
