The increase in the severe infectious diseases and resistance of the majority of the bacterial pathogens to the available drug is a serious problem now a day. In order to overcome this problem it is necessary to develop new therapeutic agents which are non-toxic and more effective to inhibit these microbial pathogens. For this purpose the plant extract of highly active medicinal plant, Taraxacum laevigatum was used for the synthesis of platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) to enhance its bio-activities. The surface plasmon resonance peak appeared at 283nm clearly represent the formation of PtNPs. The results illustrate that the bio-synthesized PtNPs were uniformly dispersed, small sized (2-7nm) and spherical in shape. The green synthesized PtNPs were characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, XRD, TEM, SEM, EDX, DLS and FTIR. These nanoparticles were tested against gram positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis) and gram negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The bio-synthesized PtNPs were examined to be more effective against both of the bacteria. The results showed, that the zone of inhibition of PtNPs against P. aeruginosa was 15 (+/-0.5) mm and B. subtilis was 18 (+/-0.8) mm. The most significant outcome of this examination is that PtNPs exhibited strong antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa and B. subtilis which have strong defensive system against several antibiotics.
