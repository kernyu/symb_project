Researchers have been looking for modifying surfaces of polymeric biomaterials approved by FDA to obtain nanofeatures and bactericidal properties. If modified, it would be very interesting because the antibiotic administration could be reduced and, therefore, the bacterial resistance. Here, we report the electrospinning of poly (lactic acid) (PLA) with high loadings of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2, 1-5wt%) and their bactericidal properties. TiO2 nanoparticles have been recognized for a long time for their antibacterial, low cost and self-cleaning properties. However, their ability to reduce bacteria functions when used in polymers has not been well studied to date. In this context, we aimed here to generate nanostructured PLA electrospun fiber-TiO2 nanoparticle composites for further evaluation of their bactericidal activity and cell viability. TEM and SEM micrographs revealed the successful electrospinning of PLA/TiO2 and the generation of polymer-TiO2 nanostructures. When increasing the TiO2 concentration, we observed a proportional increase in the nanoparticle density along the fiber and surface. The nanostructured PLA/TiO2 nanofibers showed no mammalian cell toxicity and, most importantly, possessed bactericidal activity with higher TiO2 loads. Such results suggest that the present PLA electrospun fiber-TiO2 nanoparticle composites should be further studied for a wide range of biomedical applications.
