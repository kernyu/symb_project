Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the leading cause of liver disease worldwide. In this study, we analyzed four treatment-naive patients infected with subtype 1a and performed Roche/454 pyrosequencing across the coding region. We report the presence of low-level drug resistance mutations that would most likely have been missed using conventional sequencing methods. The approach described here is broadly applicable to studies of viral diversity and could help to improve the efficacy of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA) in the treatment of HCV-infected patients.
