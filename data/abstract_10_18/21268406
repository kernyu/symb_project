Laninamivir is a novel neuraminidase inhibitor of influenza viruses and it has been reported that its prodrug, CS-8958 shows a long-lasting characteristics. Using viruses isolated in Nagasaki of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus which cause pandemic in 2009, it was shown that laninamivir has a strong inhibitory activities against their neuraminidases and virus replication in cultured cells, and strong binding stability to the virus NA. Furthermore, a single intranasal administration of CS-8958 showed a superior reduction of virus load in lungs in mouse infection model. These suggest that CS-8958 will work as a long-acting neuraminidase inhibitor to an infection with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza viruses as well.
