We assessed the effect of increasing manganese concentrations in test media (0.001 to 1,024 mg/liter) on MICs of tigecycline. For both broth microdilution (BMD) and Etests, this effect was negligible for physiological concentrations, but MICs increased when concentrations exceeded 8 mg/liter. Susceptibility testing should be performed on media with standardized low manganese content.
