OBJECTIVE: Candida albicans has become a major problem of oral candidiasis due to increase in antibiotic resistance. Rhodomyrtus tomentosa, a medicinal plant possessing several phytochemical constituents, has been considered as a potential source of antimicrobial and immunomodulatory agents. The aim of this study was to investigate anti-virulence and immunostimulatory activity of R. tomentosa ethanolic leaf extract against C. albicans. METHODS: The effects of the extract on C. albicans were assessed on germ tube production, adherence of the organisms to surfaces, and biofilm. In addition, the effects of the extract on phagocytosis and killing activity of neutrophils against the pathogen were investigated. RESULTS: Suppression of germ tube production following 30min exposure to the extract at 256mug/mL was significantly increased in comparison with that of the unexposed cells (p<0.05). The pathogens demonstrated a significant reduction in adherence ability to surfaces in a dose dependent manner, compared with the control (p<0.05). At 48h, the extract at 512-1024mug/mL significantly reduced biofilm forming ability of the organisms up to 42.31-64.58% (p<0.05). Compared with the control group, a significant inhibition of mature biofilm after treated with the extract at 256mug/mL was observed (p<0.05). The extract at 50mug/mL significantly enhanced phagocytosis and killing activity of neutrophils against the organism, compared with the control (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that R. tomentosa extract displayed a dual mode of action, inhibiting virulence factors of C. albicans and enhancing neutrophil functions. Further pharmaceutical development of the extract might be useful as an alternative therapeutic agent against oral candidiasis.
