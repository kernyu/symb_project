This study aimed to determine the occurrence, abundance, and variation of seven Macrolides-Lincosamide-Streptogramin (MLS) resistance genes (ereB, ermA, ermB, ermF, mefA, vatB, mphA) and six potential indicator ARGs (tet (B), sul1, qnrS, fexA, IntI1, ermB) from three ponds at university by quantitative PCR and assess the impacts on the surroundings. Solid samples (fish feces, soil and sediment) and water samples were tested. All the genes were found at low levels in soil samples. For the MLS resistance genes, only two MLS genes (ermB, ermF) were detected in all samples and significant correlations between ermB and Sigma MLS (R = 0.91 in solid samples; R = 0.86 in water samples, p < 0.01) were found. For the potential indicators, intl1 and sul1 were present at high levels in the three different ponds while the other genes showed varying levels. These findings show that the ermB gene can probably be served as an indicator to evaluate the overall level of MLS resistance genes. The fairly low abundance of all the tested resistance genes in soil samples and the moderate levels in other samples suggests that the university ponds kept a good state and did not have a significant impact on their surroundings.
