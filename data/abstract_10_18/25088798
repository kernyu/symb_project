BACKGROUND: Microbial resistance to antibiotics has triggered the development of nanoscale materials as an alternative strategy. To stabilize these particles an inert support is needed. METHOD: Porous nanomullite developed by sol-gel route is loaded with copper and silver nanoparticle by simple adsorption method. These nanocomposites are characterized using XRD, FTIR, TEM, SEM, EDAX and UV-visible spectrophotometer. Antibacterial activity of these nanocomposites against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria are performed by bactericidal kinetics, flow cytometry and MTT assay. The underlying mechanisms behind the antimicrobial property and cell death are also investigated by EPR spectroscopy, intracellular ROS measurement and beta-galactosidase assay. The cytocompatibility of the nanocomposites is investigated by cell viability (MTT), proliferation (Alamar blue) and wound healing assay of mammalian fibroblast cell line. RESULTS: Nanocomposites show a fairly uniform distribution of metal nanoparticle within mullite matrix. They show excellent antibacterial activity. Metal ions/nanoparticle is found to be released from the materials (CM and SM). Treated cells manifested high intracellular oxidative stress and beta-galactosidase activity in the growth medium. The effect of nanocomposites on mammalian cell line depends on exposure time and concentration. The scratch assay shows normal cell migration with respect to control. CONCLUSION: The fabricated nanoparticles possess diverse antimicrobial mechanism and exhibit good cytocompatibility along with wound healing characteristics in mouse fibroblast cell line (L929). GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The newly synthesized materials are promising candidates for the development of antimicrobial ceramic coatings for biomedical devices and therapeutic applications.
