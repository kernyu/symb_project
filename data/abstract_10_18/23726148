We examined the prevalence of various cephalosporins' resistance mechanisms in Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates. Phenotypic and molecular detection of Ambler classes A, B and D beta-lactamases was performed on 75 isolates. Clonal relatedness was defined using Repetitive Extragenic Palindromic PCR. PCR mapping was used to examine the linkage of insertion sequences and the ampC gene, and ampC expression was analyzed by TaqMan reverse transcriptase-PCR. Twenty-six (37%) isolates carried at least one of the blaPER-1 or blaTEM-1. Sixty-nine (98.5%) out of 70 cephalosporin-resistant isolates had insertions upstream of the ampC gene, of which 48 (69%) and 6 (8%) were identified as ISAba1and ISAba125, respectively. Higher level of expression was obtained in resistant isolates lacking ISAba1/ampC combination in comparison with that in positive ones. The ability to up-regulate the expression of ampC gene in association with different insertion elements has become an important factor in A. baumannii resistance to cephalosporins.
