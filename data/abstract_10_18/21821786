Parasitic infections caused by Entamoeba histolytica are still major threats against public health, especially in developing countries. Although current therapies exist, the problems associated with parasite resistance and negative side effects make it imperative to search for new therapeutic agents. A systematic scaffold analysis reported herein of a public database containing 474 antiamoebic compounds reveals that benzimidazole is the most active scaffold reported thus far. To gain insights into the antiamoebic activity of novel compounds, the authors report herein the biological activity of 12 compounds, including benzotriazole and indazole derivatives, scaffolds not previously tested against E. histolytica. Compounds with the benzotriazole and indazole scaffolds showed low micromolar activity (IC(50) = 0.304 and 0.339 microM) and are more active than metronidazole, which is the drug of choice used for the treatment of amebiosis. The novel compounds have similar properties to approved drugs. Compounds with novel scaffolds represent promising starting points of an optimization program against E. histolytica.
