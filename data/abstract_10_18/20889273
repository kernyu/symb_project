We conducted a survey among participants to a French ID Society sponsored meeting for antimicrobial management teams (AMT). We analysed 115 responses. Respondents were mostly physicians (79%) followed by microbiologists (11%), infection control practitioners (9%) and hospital pharmacists (7%). Only 43% were ID board certified while 47% had a university degree on antibiotic use. AMT activities concerning diagnostic and therapeutic advice, residents training and antibiotic use audit were mostly managed by physicians. Antimicrobial resistance and antibiotic consumption were managed, respectively, by the microbiologist and the hospital pharmacist. This survey shows the interest of a multidisciplinary antimicrobial management team. However, the cornerstone of the AMR is clearly the physician. Small hospital could contract part time physician and work through regional teams.
