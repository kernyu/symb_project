PRINCIPLES: Unnecessary treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria and overuse of urinary catheters in hospitals are of concern regarding antimicrobial resistance and patient safety, respectively. We investigated the effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention in reducing urinary catheter use and unnecessary prescription of antibiotics for asymptomatic bacteriuria in hospitalised patients in a clinic for internal medicine. METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively from all inpatients during a 3-month period both before and after a multifaceted intervention from the Clinic for Internal Medicine of our secondary care hospital. The intervention consisted of implementation of guidelines, establishment of a standard for urinary catheter management, introduction of restricted orders and a reminder of indwelling catheters, as well as lectures and internet-based learning focusing on asymptomatic bacteriuria. RESULTS: The incidence rate of urinary catheter days decreased significantly from 27 to 17 catheter days per 100 patient days (incidence rate ratio 0.61, 95% confidence interval 0.57-0.67). The incidence rate of unnecessary antibiotic treatment days for asymptomatic bacteriuria dropped significantly from 22 to 10 treatment days per 1,000 patient days (incidence rate ratio 0.46, 95% confidence interval 0.33-0.63). CONCLUSIONS: A multifaceted intervention was effective in reducing both urinary catheter days and inappropriate antibiotic use for asymptomatic bacteriuria.
