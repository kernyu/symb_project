The treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) has undergone a period of rapid evolution. The era of combination direct antivirals has led to high rates of sustained viral response (SVR), limited toxicities, and more broad applicability across patient demographics. Even current therapies have their limitations, however, including genotype specificity and variable durations of treatment depending on the presence or absence of cirrhosis. Developing a fixed-duration pangenotypic regimen that can broadly treat all stages of fibrosis with equal rates of SVR in all patients, irrespective of treatment experience, is the goal of future therapies. This article reviews antivirals in development.
