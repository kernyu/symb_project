The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of two antibiotic therapy protocols for osteomyelitis with different durations of intravenous treatment. This was a prospective randomized study of children treated for acute hematogenous osteomyelitis. Patients in group 1 (G1) received 7 days of intravenous antibiotics, whereas patients in group 2 (G2) received 14 days. Treatment was deemed effective if there were no signs of chronic osteomyelitis at the last follow-up. Fifty-three patients were included in the study (G1=27, G2=26). After a mean follow-up of 11.5 months, none of the patients in either group showed signs of chronic osteomyelitis. In conclusion, a shortened treatment of 7 days of intravenous antibiotic therapy is as effective as a longer treatment.
