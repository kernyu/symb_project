Nationwide surveys of antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria isolated from bloodstream infections are required to fit empiric therapy to recent trends and detect emerging resistance. We report the results of a French national prospective survey based on the College of Bacteriology-Virology and Hygiene study group network performed each October during the 1996 to 2007 period, with focus on Enterobacteriaceae (7708 isolates) and Staphylococcus aureus (2271 isolates). The most relevant antimicrobial susceptibilities trends were i) a decrease in fluoroquinolones susceptibility among Enterobacteriaceae (96-90%, P < 0.0001) and Escherichia coli isolates (98-89%, P < 0.0001), respectively, ii) the slight but significant decrease in cefotaxime susceptibility among E. coli (P = 0.016), and iii) the significant increase in gentamicin susceptibility among S. aureus strains (P = 0.016). This survey reports antibiotic susceptibility of bloodstream pathogens in France. The empiric use of fluoroquinolones in severe infections should be cautiously monitored by thorough clinical and microbiologic follow-up.
