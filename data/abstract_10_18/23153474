We describe the first isolation in France of a New-Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In March 2012, a patient with history of prior hospitalisation in Serbia was diagnosed in France with acute pyelonephritis due to NDM-1 producing P. aeruginosa. Clinical and microbiological cure was obtained under appropriate antibiotic treatment. Two months later, she presented with a recurrence due to the same bacteria, with a favourable evolution. During both hospitalisations, contact isolation precautions were implemented and no cross-transmission was observed.
