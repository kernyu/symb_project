We investigated the susceptibility to antibacterial agents, genotype of penicillin-binding protein (PBP) genes and macrolide resistant genes, and the serotypes against 270 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from medical facilities in Gifu and Aichi prefectures between October 2011 and April 2012. These results were compared with those against S. pneumoniae isolated in 2008-2009 and 2010-2011. The number of gPSSP with 3 normal PBP genes, gPISP with 1 or 2 normal PBP genes and gPRSP with 3 abnormal genes isolated in 2011-2012 was 15 (5.6%), 162 (60.0%) and 93 (34.4%) strains, respectively. Compared with those isolated in 2008-2009 and 2010-2011, the numbers of gPRSP were decreasing. On the other hand, the isolates with no macrolide-resistant gene, only mefA, only ermB, and both mefA and ermB were 16 (5.9%), 75 (27.8%), 153 (56.7%) and 26 (9.6%). Compared with those isolated in 2008-2009 and 2010-2011, the numbers of isolates with ermB, which was usually associated with high-level resistance, were increasing. The prevalent pneumococcal serotypes in children were type 3 (14.4%), following by type 15 and 19F (9.3%). The coverages of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) were calculated as 22.9% and 49.2%, respectively. The coverages of PCV7 and PCV13 in gPRSP isolated from children were 47.7% (21/44 strains) and 72.7% (32/44 strains). The MIC90 of each antibacterial agent was as follows; 0.125pg/mL for imipenem, panipenem and garenoxacin, 0.25 mug/mL for meropenem and doripenem, 0.5 mug/mL for cefditoren, moxifloxacin and tosufloxacin, 1 mug/mL for amoxicillin, clavulanic acid/amoxicillin, cefteram, cefcapene and ceftriaxone, 2 mug/mL for benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, sulbactam/ampicillin, piperacillin, tazobactam/piperacillin and levofloxacin, 4 mug/mL for cefdinir, flomoxef and pazufloxacin, 16 mug/mL for minocycline, > 64 mug/mL for clarithromycin and azithromycin, and these MIC90s were about the same as those in 2010-2011.
