We report a successfully treated case of spondylodiscitis and bloodstream infection due to vancomycin heteroresistant Staphylococcus capitis, in an adult immunocompetent patient with multiple antibiotics intolerance. S. capitis is rarely involved in osteomyelitis and, to our knowledge, this is the first report of vancomycin heteroresistance phenomenon in an S. capitis strain causing spondylodiscitis.
