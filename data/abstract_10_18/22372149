OBJECTIVE: To discuss the inhibit mechanism primarily of extracts from Coptis on clinical resistant the medicine of Staphylococcus aureus. METHODS: Used SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, spectrophotometry and semiautomatic biochemistry analysis to detect the accumulated concentration of norfloxacin, membranin electrophoretogram and the enzymatic activity in extracellular fluid before and after Coptis extract disposition. RESULTS: The accumulated concentration of medicine norfloxacin within the experiment strains which treated with Coptis extract was clear higher than that of the blank space (P < 0.01); some proteins which molecular weights were in 35 - 38 kDa rebound expressed after Coptis extract treated; The extracellular fluid enzymic activities of resistant Staphylococcus aureus had no significant difference (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The inhibit mechanism primarily of extracts from Coptis on clinical resistant the medicine of Staphylococcus aureus is the results of the combined action of various chemical composition and multi-target interaction, and the exact molecular mechanism remains to be further researched.
