The selection of multiresistant microorganisms, as a side-effect of the use of antimicrobials, together with the lack of new therapeutic drugs expected in the near future, forces to a rational use of antibiotics. The optimisation of antibacterial treatments based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis (PK/PD) may contribute to prolong the life of antibiotics and to contain the bacterial resistance to them. A review is made of the importance of the appropriateness of the dose regimen selected, the application of PK/PD analysis of antimicrobials, the Monte Carlo simulation, PK/PD indices for efficacy, and PK/PD cut-off points. PK/PD analysis is also applicable to the prevention of bacterial resistance. Different methods have been used to study the factors that lead to its emergence and spread, such as in vitro and animal models, and resistance prevention studies (mutant selection window). Although the PK/PD analysis is a very useful tool for the selection of the most appropriate dose regimen of antibiotics, several problems limit its use in clinical practice.
