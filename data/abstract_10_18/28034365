BACKGROUND: Today considerable number of drugs are produced from plants. Several plants with antibacterial and healing applications are used in medicine such as Roman chamomile (Chamaemelum nobile L.). Wound infection is one of the most prevalent infections among infectious disease around the world. Due to appearance of drug resistance, researchers are now paying attention to medicinal plants. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the antimicrobial and wound healing properties of C. nobile against Pseudomonas aeruginosa using in vivo conditions. METHODS: Ethanolic extract of C. nobile was provided using standard method. The 5% C. nobile ointment was prepared by dissolving lyophilized extract in eucerin. Forty five male rats were obtained from Ilam university. After anesthetization and wound creation, wounds were infected by P. aeruginosa. The rats were divided into three groups, group I was treated with C. nobile ointment, group II was treated with tetracycline ointment and the third group was treated with base gel as control group. RESULTS: Antibacterial and wound healing activities of C. nobile ointment was more than tetracycline ointment significantly. Our results indicated that extract of C. nobile had effective antibacterial activity and accelerates the progression of wound healing. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that antibacterial and wound healing activities of C. nobile ointment was notable. C. nobile therapy in combination with antibiotics can also be useful because medicinal plants contents operate in synergy with antibiotics. These results revealed the value of plant extracts to control antibiotic resistant bacteria in wound infection.
