Cellulose fiber sheets impregnated with saccharide capped-ZnO nanoparticles were used as bioactive materials for antibody immobilization. First, ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized in the presence of glucose (monosaccharide), sucrose (disaccharide) as well as alginic acid and starch (polysaccharides). The pine cellulose fibers were then modified by the obtained saccharide capped nanoparticles and further incorporated into the sheets. The presence of ZnO significantly improved the immobilization of the antibodies on the surface of the sheets. After rewetting the alginic acid-ZnO modified sheets with saline solution, the retention of antibodies was about 95%. A high degree of the immobilization of biomolecules is an important feature for possible fabrications of bioactive- or biosensing-papers and we successfully tested the sheets on the detection of blood types using (A, B, and D blood antibodies). The ZnO nanoparticles affected also the other properties of the sheets. The ZnO-modified fiber sheets showed higher values of tensile index (strength), smoothness and opacity, while the value of porosity was substantially lower than that of the unmodified sheet. The presence of ZnO nanoparticles provided also the antimicrobial activity to the sheets. They showed a strong activity against bacteria (Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus) and strong resistance to the attack of cellulase producing fungus Gloeophyllum trabeum.
