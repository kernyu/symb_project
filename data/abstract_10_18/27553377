In this analysis of the ASTRAL trials (non-opioid substitution therapy [OST], n = 984; OST, n = 51) evaluating the once-daily, pan-genotypic regimen of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for hepatitis C virus infection, OST did not impact completion, adherence, sustained virologic response (SVR12), or safety. SVR12 was 96% (95% confidence interval, 87%, >99%) in those receiving OST.
