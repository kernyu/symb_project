To date, corticosteroids have been the primary therapies for acute, severe ulcerative colitis (UC). Patients not responding to intravenous steroids assessed at 3-5 days of the treatment are candidates for second-line rescue therapy. Cyclosporine (CsA), tacrolimus and infliximab (IFX) are also effective therapeutic options in acute, severe UC. In this review we summarized the results of the published studies examining and comparing the efficacy of CsA, tacrolimus and IFX as rescue therapies, and assessing the outcome of switching the drugs in case of therapeutic failure.
