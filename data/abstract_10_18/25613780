The European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) was established to harmonise clinical antimicrobial breakpoints and to define breakpoints for new agents in Europe. Data from the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net) external quality assessment (EQA) exercises from 2009 to 2012, from the United Kingdom External Quality Assessment Scheme (UK NEQAS) from November 2009 to March 2013 and data collected by EUCAST through a questionnaire in the first quarter of 2013 were analysed to investigate implementation of EUCAST guidelines in Europe. A rapid change to use of EUCAST breakpoints was observed over time. Figures for implementation of EUCAST breakpoints at the end of the studied period were 61.2% from EARSNet data and 73.2% from UK NEQAS data. Responses to the EUCAST questionnaire indicated that EUCAST breakpoints were used by over 50% of laboratories in 18 countries, by 10 to 50% of laboratories in eight countries and by less than 10% in seven countries. The EUCAST disk diffusion method was used by more than 50% of laboratories in 12 countries, by 10 to 50% of laboratories in ten countries and by less than 10% in eleven countries. EUCAST guidelines implementation is essential to ensure consistent clinical reporting of antimicrobial susceptibility results and antimicrobial resistance surveillance.
