Bistable populations of bacteria give rise to two or more subtypes that exhibit different phenotypes. We have explored whether the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis exhibits bistable invasive phenotypes. Using a modified cell invasion assay, we show for the first time that there are two distinct subtypes within a population of P. gingivalis strains NCTC 11834 and W50 that display differences in their ability to invade oral epithelial cells. The highly invasive subtype invades cells at 10-30-fold higher levels than the poorly invasive subtype and remains highly invasive for approximately 12-16 generations. Analysis of the gingipain activity of these subtypes revealed that the highly invasive type had reduced cell-associated arginine-specific protease activity. The role of Arg-gingipain activity in invasion was verified by enhancement of invasion by rgpAB mutations and by inclusion of an Arg-gingipain inhibitor in invasion assays using wild-type bacteria. In addition, a population of DeltargpAB bacteria did not contain a hyperinvasive subtype. Screening of the protease activity of wild-type populations of both strains identified high and low protease subtypes which also showed a corresponding reduction or enhancement, respectively, of invasive capabilities. Microarray analysis of these bistable populations revealed a putative signature set of genes that includes oxidative stress resistance and iron transport genes, and which might be critical to invasion of or survival within epithelial cells.
