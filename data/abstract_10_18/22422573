We investigated the molecular basis of the tolerance of Candida albicans biofilms to antifungals using the miconazole as a model compound, and translated the resulting data to other antifungals. Sessile cells of C. albicans Deltaefg1, lacking the transcription factor Efg1, showed increased susceptibility to miconazole, amphotericin B and caspofungin, whereas these sessile cells were equally resistant to fluconazole. The increased sensitivity to miconazole was, at least, partly due to an increased accumulation of miconazole in the cells as compared to wild-type or reintegrant Deltaefg1(EFG1) sessile cells. By using a rat biofilm model, we further confirmed the role of Efg1 in the tolerance of C. albicans biofilms to miconazole when grown in vivo.
