AIM: Acinetobacter bereziniae clinical relevance is starting to be recognized; however, very few descriptions of its carbapenem resistance currently exist. Here we characterize two carbapenem-resistant A. bereziniae isolates. MATERIALS & METHODS: Isolates were obtained from environmental and clinical samples. Carbapenemases were searched by phenotypic, biochemical and PCR assays. Clonality was studied by ApaI-PFGE and genetic location for carbapenemase genes were assessed by I-CeuI and S1 hybridizations. RESULTS: Isolates were not clonally related but both produced the 'exclusively Portuguese' IMP-5, with the clinical isolate also producing an OXA-58. The carbapenemase genes were plasmid located. CONCLUSION: Our results emphasize the role of non-baumannii Acinetobacter species as important reservoirs of clinically relevant resistance genes that could also contribute to their emergence as nosocomial pathogens.
