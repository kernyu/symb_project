PURPOSE: Infections of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are becoming an increasingly concerning clinical problem. The aim of this study was to assess the development of MRSA in urine cultures in a major public university-affiliated hospital and the therapeutical and hygiene-related possibilities for reducing resistance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 243 samples from patients diagnosed with MRSA infection over a period of 6 years. An agar diffusion test measured the effects of antimicrobial agents against bacteria grown in culture. The analyses were based on the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. RESULTS: A regression analysis was performed, which showed 100% resistance to the following antibiotics throughout the entire testing period: carbapenem, cephalosporin (1st-4th generation), penicillin G, aminopenicillin, beta-lactamase, and isoxazolyl penicillin. However, a significant decrease in resistance was found for amikacin, gentamicin, clindamycin, levofloxacin, erythromycin, and mupirocin. CONCLUSIONS: MRSA showed a decreasing trend of antimicrobial resistance, except against carbapenem, cephalosporin (1st-4th generation), penicillin G, aminopenicillin, beta-lactamase, and isoxazolyl penicillin, for which complete resistance was observed.
