AMR has been cited as the most significant health issue of the 21st century with potentially serious consequences for the health of global populations, including New Zealand, and its health system. Proactive approaches to combating AMR through better understanding of the causes will inform measures required to reduce potential threats. The Royal Australasian College of Physicians (RACP) identifies three pathogens where increased resistance is of concern and recommends collaborative responses to prevent emerging threats to New Zealand populations. An international best practice AMR programme would include antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) building on evidence, policy, organisational support, multidisciplinary teams and patient experience. The planned Ministry of Health-led collaborative approach to developing a national strategy and programme will provide sector direction. Implementation will require extensive engagement with the health sector and communities to develop joint solutions that prevent further increases in AMR.
