OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a major public health concern globally. We report the first verified treatment failure of gonorrhoea with 2 g of azithromycin (extended-release formulation) in Japan and characteristics of the corresponding N. gonorrhoeae isolates. METHODS: Pre- and post-treatment isolates (n = 4) were investigated by Etest for antimicrobial susceptibility. The isolates were examined for molecular epidemiology by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), N. gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequence typing (NG-MAST) and multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA), and for the presence of azithromycin resistance determinants (23S rRNA gene mutations, erm genes and mtrR mutations). RESULTS: All isolates were resistant to azithromycin (MIC 4 mg/L) and ciprofloxacin, but remained susceptible to cefixime, ceftriaxone and spectinomycin. All isolates were assigned to MLST ST1901 and NG-MAST ST1407 and three of four isolates possessed MLVA profile 8-3-21-16-1. All isolates contained the previously described C2599T mutation (N. gonorrhoeae numbering) in all four 23S rRNA alleles and the previously described single-nucleotide (A) deletion in the mtrR promoter region. CONCLUSIONS: This verified treatment failure occurred in a patient infected with an MLST ST1901/NG-MAST ST1407 strain of N. gonorrhoeae. While this international strain commonly shows resistance or decreased susceptibility to multiple antimicrobials, including extended-spectrum cephalosporins, the strain reported here remained fully susceptible to the latter antimicrobials. Hence, two subtypes of azithromycin-resistant gonococcal MLST ST1901/NG-MAST ST1407 appear to have evolved and to be circulating in Japan. Azithromycin should not be recommended as a single antimicrobial for first-line empirical treatment of gonorrhoea.
