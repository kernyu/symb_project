BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) may cause suppurative otitis externa with severe inflammation and ulceration in dogs. Multidrug resistance is commonly reported for this organism, creating a difficult therapeutic challenge. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of a gel containing 0.5 mug/mL of antimicrobial peptide AMP2041, 0.07% chlorhexidine digluconate (CLX), 0.4% Tris and 0.1% EDTA on 30 clinical isolates of PA from canine otitis externa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antimicrobial activity was evaluated through minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC). Standardized bacterial suspensions were incubated with different concentrations of the gel at 37 degrees C for 30 min and plated for colony forming unit (CFU) counts. Time-to-kill kinetics were evaluated with the undiluted product and at MBC for each PA strain at 30 s, 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 min, 24 and 48 h. RESULTS: The MBC was 1:64 for two of 30 strains, 1:128 for 15 of 30 strains and 1:256 for 13 of 30 strains. The geometric mean was 1:165, equivalent to a concentration of 0.003 mug/mL AMP2041 + 0.0004% CLX + 0.0024%Tris + 0.0006% EDTA. Time-to-kill assays with the undiluted product showed complete bactericidal effect within 30 s for all isolates, whereas at the MBC this effect was reached within 5 min for 20 of 30 isolates and within 30 min for all isolates. Bactericidal activity was maintained after 48 h for all isolates. CONCLUSION: This gel has shown rapid, complete and long-lasting activity against a panel of 30 PA isolates from cases of canine otitis externa.
