This study investigated the MICs of 17 antimicrobials, for 606 toxigenic clinical isolates of Clostridium difficile collected between 1993 and 2007 in Sweden. Low MIC(90) values were found for metronidazole (0.5 mg/L), vancomycin (1.0 mg/L), teicoplanin (0.125 mg/L), fusidic acid (1.0 mg/L), linezolid (2.0 mg/L), daptomycin (2.0 mg/L) and tigecycline (0.064 mg/L). Three isolates (0.5%) had elevated MICs for vancomycin (4-8 mg/L); however, these isolates originated from the same patient, who was receiving long-term intravenous vancomycin treatment. High-level clindamycin resistant isolates (MIC >256 mg/L) peaked in 1997 with 39 of 95 (41%) and out of these, 36% were also highly resistant to erythromycin. beta-Lactams such as penicillin V and piperacillin displayed MIC(90)s of 8 and 32 mg/L, respectively, whereas MICs of cefuroxime were >256 mg/L for all isolates. Universal resistance to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin was found, and resistance to moxifloxacin increased from 4% of isolates in 2004 to 23% in 2007. Notably, these moxifloxacin-resistant isolates did not belong to the recent epidemic PCR ribotype 027, but to the pre-existing epidemic type 012 (82%), and these isolates accounted for the majority of isolates that were resistant to clindamycin (70%), tetracycline (84%) and rifampicin (92%) as well. This investigation of susceptibility data on clinical C. difficile isolates showed variations of multiresistance to be due to a specific PCR ribotype 012, emphasizing the importance of genotyping when evaluating emerging resistance over time.
