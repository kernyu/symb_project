KEY MESSAGE: Japonica and indica have different non-host resistance (NHR) abilities to Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici ( Pst ), and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) has a positive function in NHR to japonica against Pst. ABSTRACT: Non-host interactions between Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) and two rice subspecies were characterized using 23 rice varieties, including 11 japonica and 12 indica. Results showed that the infected fungal structures were easily produced in the leaves of indica, whereas only several substomatal vesicles and primary infection hyphae were observed in the leaves of japonica. This result indicated that indica is less resistant or more susceptible to Pst than japonica. Hydrogen peroxide accumulated in the initial phase of japonica-Pst interaction but not in indica-Pst interaction. A set of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related genes was also induced in response to Pst infection, suggesting that ROS activation is one of the major mechanisms of non-host resistance of rice to Pst.
