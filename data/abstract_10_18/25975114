The earliest eight clinical strains of Pseudomonas fulva were identified in the culture collection of pseudomonads isolated in St. Petersburg in 1995-2005, that confirmed the medical importance of the species. A high level of the species identification of all the strains of P. fulva by MALDI-TOF mass-spectrometry with the use of Microflex device with database MALDI Biotyper (Bruker Daltonics Inc.) was shown. Tests for routine studies providing identification of P. fulva without the use of genetic methods were approved. The profile of the antibiotic susceptibility of the clinical strains of P. fulva was described. Acquired resistance of two P. fulva isolates to the 3rd generation cephalosporins and chloramphenicol was detected.
