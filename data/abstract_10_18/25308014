With the increase in invasive fungal infections due to Candida species and resistance to antifungal therapy, in vitro antifungal susceptibility testing is becoming an important part of clinical microbiology laboratories. Along with broth microdilution and disk diffusion method, various commercial methods are being increasingly used for antifungal susceptibility testing, especially in the developed world. In our study, we compared the antifungal susceptibility patterns of 39 isolates of Candida to three antifungal drugs (fluconazole, amphotericin B, ketoconazole) by Candifast and disk diffusion method. The following resistance pattern was found by Candifast: Fluconazole (30.8%), ketoconazole (12.8%), amphotericin B (0%). The results obtained by disk diffusion method were in complete agreement with Candifast results.
