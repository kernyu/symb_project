The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) Haemophilus influenzae isolated from patients of a teaching hospital in Thailand. Eighty-eight isolates of H. influenzae were collected between September 2005 and March 2008. All isolates were identified and characterized for biotypes and capsular types. The beta-lactamase production of these isolates was examined, and their susceptibility to the following 12 antimicrobial agents was determined: ampicillin (AMP), amoxicillin-clavulanate (AMC), cefotaxime (CTX), cefuroxime (CXM), meropenem (MEM), clarithromycin (CLR), telithromycin (TEL), tetracycline (TET), ciprofloxacin (CIP), levofloxacin (LEV), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT), and chloramphenicol (CHL). Of the 88 H. influenzae isolates, 69 (78.4%), 13 (14.8%), 4 (4.5%), and 2 (2.3%) were from the respiratory tract, pus, the genital tract, and blood, respectively. Half of the isolates were biotype II (44 isolates, 50%). The other half comprised biotypes I (23 isolates, 26.1%), III (15 isolates, 17.1%), and IV (6 isolates, 6.8%). All isolates were capsular non-typeable, except for 2 isolates that were type f. Antimicrobial susceptibility showed that all isolates were susceptible to AMC, CTX, MEM, TEL, CIP, and LEV (100%), whereas 96.6%, 94.3%, 80.7%, 68.2%, 50.0%, and 44.3% were susceptible to CXM, CLR, CHL, TET, AMP, and SXT, respectively. The beta-lactamase-production rate of H. influenzae isolates was 40.9%, and the prevalence of BLNAR was 18.2%.
