There is significant diversity in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clones arising in the community worldwide, with considerable geographical differences in typical antimicrobial resistance profiles. Many community clones of MRSA have a non-multidrug resistant antimicrobial profile, providing increased options for empirical and directed therapy of infections caused by these strains. However, the recent description of increasing non-beta lactam resistance in community clones of MRSA, especially USA300, provides a timely warning for clinicians making decisions about therapy for patients potentially infected with these strains. Continued monitoring of global epidemiology and emerging drug resistance data is critical for the effective management of these infections.
