In Southernmost Brazil HIV-1 subtypes B, C, and CRF31_BC co-circulates and, since 1996 with the implementation of free access to highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART), this epidemic is under a quite characteristic selective pressure. The profile of mutations and polymorphisms in the protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) genes of HIV-1 from untreated patients living in Porto Alegre, Southernmost Brazil were evaluated in order to identify the subtypes and circulating drug resistant genotypes. Blood samples from 99 HIV-1 positive drugs-naive patients were collected from 2006 to 2007 in Porto Alegre, Brazil. HIV PR and RT genes were amplified, sequenced, and subtyped. The HIV-1 genotyping was performed by partial sequence analysis of the pol in the HIV Drug Resistance Database of Stanford University. Phylogenetic analyses allowed to classify the HIV samples according to their subtypes: B (26.2%), C (39.4%), F (1.1%), CRF31_CB (19.2%), and URF (14.1%). Eight (8.1%) samples showed primary resistance mutations according to the Calibrated Population Resistance tool based in the 2009 Surveillance Drug Resistance Mutation list. Two samples presented resistance mutations to PI, three NRTI and three NNRTI. There was no significant association between presence of resistant genotypes and subtypes, but resistance mutations seem to be less frequent in the subtype C. In addition, this study describes for the first time the mutational profile of CRF31_BC to PI, NRTI, and NNRTI. Genetic analyses of HIV-1 from naive patients are a promising and important method for surveillance of HIV infection.
