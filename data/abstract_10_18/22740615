Plants utilize a large number of immune receptors to recognize pathogens and activate defense responses. A small number of these receptors belong to the receptor-like protein family. Previously, we showed that a gain-of-function mutation in the receptor-like protein SNC2 (for Suppressor of NPR1, Constitutive2) leads to constitutive activation of defense responses in snc2-1D mutant plants. To identify defense signaling components downstream of SNC2, we carried out a suppressor screen in the snc2-1D mutant background of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Map-based cloning of one of the suppressor genes, BDA1 (for bian da; "becoming big" in Chinese), showed that it encodes a protein with amino-terminal ankyrin repeats and carboxyl-terminal transmembrane domains. Loss-of-function mutations in BDA1 suppress the dwarf morphology and constitutive defense responses in snc2-1D npr1-1 (for nonexpressor of pathogenesis-related genes1,1) and also result in enhanced susceptibility to bacterial pathogens. In contrast, a gain-of-function allele of bda1 isolated from a separate genetic screen to search for mutants with enhanced pathogen resistance was found to constitutively activate cell death and defense responses. These data suggest that BDA1 is a critical signaling component that functions downstream of SNC2 to regulate plant immunity.
