INTRODUCTION: Tuberculosis is a health problem worldwide. The World Health Organization estimated 9.6 million new cases and 480,000 multirresistant cases for 2014. The assessment of resistance to quinolones and injectables was implemented only a few years ago, so its prevalence is not known. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of resistance to amikacin, capreomycin and ofloxacin in cases of tuberculosis resistant to isoniazid and/or rifampin during 2012-2013. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 489 isolates resistant to isoniazid and/or rifampin. We used the Bactec MGITTM technique for susceptibility tests. For analyzing the rate of resistance, we grouped cases according to the history of treatment with second line drugs. RESULTS: In the 438 new cases, the drug that showed greater overall resistance was kanamycin with 7.1 % (95% CI: 4.6 to 9.6). In 51 previously treated cases, this highest resistance was 27.5 % (95% CI:14.2 to 40.7). The overall resistance was higher in cases with a history of treatment with quinolones and injectables. We found seven cases of extremely resistant tuberculosis. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the presence of resistance to second line drugs in people with drug-resistant tuberculosis with and without previous treatment with quinolones and/or injectables, these latter having a higher percentage of resistance. For that reason, it is essential to perform susceptibility testing and analyze this information routinely.
