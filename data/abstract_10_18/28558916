Biofilm-related infections represent a serious health problem, accounting for 65- 80% of all infections. The infections are generally chronic and characterized by the persistence of the microorganism, due to the increased resistance of biofilms to both the immune system and antimicrobials. Biofilms can be located to almost every human body tissue and on exogenous devices such as catheters, pacemakers, prosthetic material, implants, urinary catheters, etc. Traditional antimicrobial susceptibility studies in clinical microbiology laboratories have lied on the study of planktonic form of microorganisms. However, this approach might lead to miss the biofilm characteristics and to a treatment failure. Microbiological diagnosis and antimicrobial susceptibility studies of biofilm-related infections are complex and, nowadays, represent a challenge that clinicians and microbiologists have to address as a team in the absence of consensus or standardized protocols.
