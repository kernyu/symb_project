Here, we describe an HIV-infected patient with pretreatment resistance to raltegravir, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors, and the ultimate ability to achieve viral suppression. Pretreatment integrase resistance testing is not routinely performed because transmitted integrase mutations conferring resistance to raltegravir are currently thought to be negligible. We suggest obtaining a pretreatment integrase genotype in patients with transmitted multiclass drug resistance in order to create an optimal first regimen and increase the chance for virological suppression.
