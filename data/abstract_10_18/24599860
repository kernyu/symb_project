Petunia hybrida is a commercial ornamental plant and is also an important model species for genetic analysis and transgenic research. Here we describe the steps required to isolate stable plastid transformants in P. hybrida using the commercial Pink Wave cultivar. Wave cultivars are popular spreading Petunias sold as ground cover and potted plants. Transgenes introduced into P. hybrida plastids exhibit stable expression over many generations. The development of plastid transformation in P. hybrida provides an enabling technology to bring the benefits of plastid engineering, including maternal inheritance and stable expression of performance-enhancing trait genes, to the important floriculture and horticulture industries.
