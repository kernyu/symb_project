The complete sequence of a 137-kb plasmid, pJIE186-2, from a sequence type 131 (ST131) Escherichia coli strain was determined. pJIE186-2 contained IncF replicons (FIB, FIIA, and FIADelta), an incomplete conjugative region, and multiple virulence factors (sitABCD, iucABCD-iutA, iroCDEN, etsABC, hlyF, iss, ompT, and vagCD) but no antimicrobial resistance genes. The host strain also had another plasmid, pJIE186-1, carrying multiple resistance genes. The two plasmids conferred selective advantages for the host strain, contributing to the recent emergence of ST131 E. coli.
