The study aimed to clarify clinical significance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) rtA181S mutation in Chinese HBV-infected patients. A total of 18 419 patients with chronic HBV infection from Beijing 302 Hospital were investigated. HBV complete reverse transcriptase region of polymerase was screened by direct sequencing, and the results were verified by clonal sequencing. Replication-competent mutant and wild-type HBV genomic amplicons were constructed and transfected into the HepG2 cells and cultured in the presence or absence of serially diluted nucleos(t)ide analogues. Intracellular HBV replicative intermediates were quantitated for calculating the 50% effective concentration of the drug (EC(50)). The rtA181S was detected in 98 patients with 12 kinds of mutational patterns. Genotype C and genotype B HBV infection occupied 91.8% and 8.2% in rtA181S-positive patients, in contrast to 84.6% and 15.4% in rtA181S-negative patients (P < 0.01). All rtA181S-positive patients had received nucleos(t)ide analogues. rtA181S was detected in multiple patients with virologic breakthrough. Phenotypic analysis of patient-derived viral strains showed that rtA181S, rtA181S+N236T, rtN236T and rtA181V strains had 68.5%, 49.9%, 71.4% and 66.2% of natural replication capacity of wild-type strain, and 3.7-fold, 9.8-fold, 7.9-fold and 5.6-fold increased EC(50) to adefovir dipivoxil (ADV). The rtA181S strain remained susceptible to lamivudine, entecavir and tenofovir, and ADV susceptibility was restored after the mutation was eliminated through site-directed mutagenesis. Rescue therapy with entecavir or combination therapy was effective in rtA181S-related ADV-refractory patients. The rtA181S mutation confers moderate resistance to ADV. It could be induced by either lamivudine or ADV and contribute ADV treatment failure.
