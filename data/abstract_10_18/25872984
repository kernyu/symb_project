Griseofulvin, an antifungal drug, has been shown in recent years to have anti-proliferative activities. We report here the synthesis of new analogs of griseofulvin, substituted in 2' by a sulfonyl group or in 3' by a sulfinyl or sulfonyl group. These compounds exhibit good anti-proliferative activities against SCC114 cells, an oral squamous carcinoma cell line showing pronounced centrosome amplification, and unexpected cytotoxic activities on HCC1937 cells, a triple negative breast cancer cell line resistant to microtubule inhibitors.
