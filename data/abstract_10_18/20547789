The Klebsiella pneumoniae multidrug resistance plasmid pKP048 was completely sequenced. This plasmid carries several important resistance determinants, such as bla(KPC-2), bla(DHA-1), qnrB4, and armA, which confer resistance to carbapenems, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides, respectively. Analysis of the finished 151,188-bp sequence data revealed 163 putative genes, 108 of which were assigned functions such as replication, stable inheritance, antibiotic resistance, a mobile element, conjugal transfer, and a restriction-modification system, showing the strong phylogenetic mosaicism and plasticity of the plasmid.
