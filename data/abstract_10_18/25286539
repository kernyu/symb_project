Literature data on molecular mechanisms of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics have been summarized. The following mechanisms are examined: appearance ofpenicillin-binding proteins (PBP) with lower affinity to beta-lactam antibiotics; production by microorganisms of enzymes (beta-lactamases) that hydrolyze beta-lactam ring; disruption of microbial cell outer membrane permeability and active secretion of antibiotics from the microbial cell (effiux-effect). Characterization of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) as well as data on structure of SCCmec element of MRSA and bacterial efflux system (RND) is presented.
