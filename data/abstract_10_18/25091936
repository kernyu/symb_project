BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) remains the most effective chemotherapeutic strategy in the management of malaria. However, reports of reduced susceptibility of Plasmodium falciparum to the ACT justify the need for continued search for alternative anti-malarial drugs. The use of antibiotics with anti-malarial properties represents a potentially valuable chemotherapeutic option for the management of drug resistant infections. Thus, the intrinsic anti-malarial activity of the combination of clinical doses of rifampicin with amodiaquine and artemether was evaluated in an animal model using Plasmodium berghei. METHODS: A modification of the suppressive tests in vivo was employed. The anti-malarial activity of standard doses of amodiaquine (AQ) with or without artemether (ART) and combined with varying doses of rifampicin (RIF 15 mg/kg or RIF 30 mg/kg body weight) was evaluated in 40 mice sub-divided into eight groups and inoculated intraperitoneally with 1 x 10(7) red blood cells infected with chloroquine-resistant P. berghei ANKA strain. There were two control groups of animals, one group received amodiaquine alone while the other group received saline. Parasiticidal activity and survival of the animals were assessed over 21 days. RESULTS: Parasitaemia in the control animals peaked at 38% on day 9 and all animals died by day 10. The combination of amodiaquine with rifampicin 15 mg/kg body weight was the most effective of all the combinations and more efficacious than amodiaquine alone. The order of superiority of anti-malarial efficacy of the combinations was as follows; AQ + RIF 15 > AQ > AQ + ART + RIF 30 > AQ + ART + RIF 15 > AQ +RIF 30. CONCLUSION: The combination of the clinical dose of rifampicin (15 mg/kg) with amodiaquine represents a potentially valuable treatment option in management of drug resistant malaria. In addition, the role of pharmacokinetic interaction in multiple drug therapy cannot be over-emphasized.
