OBJECTIVE: To analyze the indications for and the efficacy of parenteral fosfomycin, especially against multidrug-resistant (MDR) and pan-resistant bacterial infections. PATIENTS AND METHODS: During a unique crisis in fosfomycin production, the supply of this antibiotic had to be carefully monitored in France over a 10-week period. One hundred and sixteen assessable patients were included in a prospective cohort study. RESULTS: The main indications for use were osteoarthritis, lung infection, urinary tract infection, and bacteraemia. The 2 bacteria most frequently involved were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus. MDR bacteria were seen in 71.5% (83/116) of cases, especially MDR P. aeruginosa (n = 28). Critical situations were common, with 44.0% (51/116) of hospitalizations occurring in an intensive care unit and 22.4% (26/116) of patients with septic shock. The overall outcome was favourable in 76.8% of cases (76/99 assessable patients). CONCLUSION: This study provided a unique opportunity to describe the use of fosfomycin and assess its efficacy, especially against MDR bacterial infections, even in critical situations.
