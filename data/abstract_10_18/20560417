Acute upper urinary tract infection may cause sepsis, especially in neonates and infants, mandating the choice of appropriate, effective antibacterials minimizing increasing bacterial resistance. Frequently prescribing broad-spectrum cephalosporinin is one such example. Different antibacterial therapies are initiated clinically due to treatment protocol differences among institutions, disease severity, etc. We studied the efficacy of cefazolin (CEZ), a first-generation cephalosporin, as first-line parenteral treatment in acute upper urinary tract infection. We found that 88.9% of microbial infections have indications for CEZ. CEZ efficacy is 91.3%, and 97.2% of urine cultures show negative results. Escherichia coli sensitivity to antibacterial agents is 90.9% of the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) < 4 for CEZ, 93.9% of MIC < 1 for ceftazidime (CAZ), 63.6% of MIC < 4 for ampicillin, and 81.8% of MIC < 2 for gentamicin. CEZ thus has the same efficacy as CAZ and is more effective than other antibacterial agents against E. coli. We concluded that CEZ is an effective antibacterial in initial antibacterial pediatric therapy in acute upper urinary tract infection.
