The growing incidence rate of breast cancer, coupled with cellular chemotherapeutic resistance, has made this disease one of the most prevalent cancers among women worldwide. Despite the recent efforts to understand the underlying cause of the resistance due to mutation, there are no feasible tactics to overcome this bottleneck. This issue could be addressed by the concept of polypharmacology-disguising drugs present in the pharmacopeia for novel purposes (drug repurposing). Of note, we have proposed a multi-modal computational drug-repositioning stratagem to predict drugs possessing anti-proliferative effect. Our results suggest that Ombitasvir, a Hepatitis C NS5B polymerase inhibitor, could be "repurposed" for the control and prevention of beta-tubulin-driven breast cancers. J. Cell.
