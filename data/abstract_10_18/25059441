Seven high-risk clones of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) belonging to clonal complex 17 were identified using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) among clinical isolates from Saudi Arabia. Among these isolates, a new hospital-associated sequence type (ST795), VanB(2)-type teicoplanin-resistant strain was detected. Its unusual phenotype resulted from a new combination of mutations in the ddl, vanS and vanW genes, which confirmed the trend of evolution in VanB-type resistance. Furthermore, characteristics of adaptation and persistence in the hospital environment of ST795 were emphasised by the presence of genes and clusters recognised to be specific for hospital-associated VREF.
