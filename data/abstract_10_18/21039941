Candida guilliermondii is an uncommon isolate throughout most of the world, the behaviour of which as an environmental fungus, a human saprophyte and an agent of serious infections has been emphasised over the years. Notably, illnesses caused by this pathogen mostly involve compromised cancer hosts and commonly lead patients to unfavourable outcomes. It is of concern that the yeast may acquire or inherently express reduced in vitro sensitivity to all antifungal classes, although widespread resistance has not yet been described, and poor correlation exists between MICs and clinical outcome. However, the organism appears as constitutively less susceptible to polyenes and echinocandins than other yeast-like fungi, so that the emergence of such pathogen in the clinical settings is of concern and may appear as a new challenge in the context of mycoses and antifungal therapy.
