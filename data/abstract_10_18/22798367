To characterize isolates of Staphylococcus aureus that were associated with staphylococcal food poisoning between 2006 and 2009 in Shenzhen, Southern China, a total of 52 Staphylococcus aureus isolates from 11 outbreaks were analyzed by using multilocus sequence typing (MLST), spa typing, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). PCR analysis was used to analyze the staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE) genes sea to sei, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was also performed. ST6 was the most dominant sequence type (ST), constituting 63.5% (34/52) of all of the isolates in 7 outbreaks. The next most common ST was ST943, which constituted 23.1% (12/52) of the isolates that were collected from 3 outbreaks. t701, t091, and t2360 were the most predominant spa types, constituting 67.3% (35/52) of the isolates that were collected from 11 outbreaks. Three PFGE types, (types A, B, and C) were the most frequently observed types, constituting 84.6% (44/52) of all of the isolates. The enterotoxin gene that we detected most frequently was sea (45/52; 86.5%). Four SE gene profiles were observed, including sea (n = 45), sec-seh (n = 3), seb (n = 2), and seg-sei (n = 2). With respect to antibiotic resistance, penicillin resistance was the most common (96.2%; 50/52), followed by resistance to tetracycline (28.8%; 15/52). Approximately 30.8% (16/52) of the isolates were resistant to at least two antibiotics, and 7.7% (4/52) of the isolates were resistant to three or more drugs. The two predominant S. aureus lineages, (i) PFGE types A and B with ST6 and (ii) PFGE type C with ST943, were identified in the outbreaks.
