Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO), an anti-CD33 immunoconjugate, was combined with high dose cytarabine (HiDAC; cytarabine 3g/m(2) over 3h daily for 5 days) for adults with relapsed or refractory AML. HiDAC plus GO 9mg/m(2) on day 7 and 4.5mg/m(2) on day 14 was not tolerated, but HiDAC followed by GO 9mg/m(2) on day 7 was safe: 12/37 (32%) patients with relapsed AML achieved complete remission. Median overall survival was 8.9 months. No grade 4 hepatic veno-occlusive disease was observed. This regimen merits further study, both in this setting and as a remission consolidation therapy.
