Influenza virus is a leading causing factor of infectious respiratory human pathology. The ability to implement the antigenic drift and development of drug resistance makes it important to develop novel anti-influenza drugs of wide spectrum of activity. In this work, we present the results of the study of the activity of a combination of glycyrrhizic acid with dipeptide alpha-glutamyl-tryptophan against oseltamivir-reistant strain of the virus Al Vladivostok/2/09 (H1 N1) on the model of lethal influenza infection in white mice. Application of Orvilax was shown to decrease the specific mortality of animals (index of protection 39-67% depending on the dose of the virus and drugs combination), to increase the mean day of death to 3.7-5.0 days and decrease the infectious titer of the virus in lung tissue to 1.3 Ig EID50/20 mg. The corresponding figures for the reference compound Tamiflu were 8-11%, 0.5-1.5 days, and 0.6 Ig EID50/20 mg. The use of Orvilax also led to reliable increase of the titers of interferon in the blood from 30.4 to 56.5 ME/mL. The results obtained allow the drug to be considered as a promising anti-influenza remedy that is active against the drug-resistant virus strains.
