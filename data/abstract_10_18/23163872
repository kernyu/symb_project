Staphylococcus aureus forms pathogenic biofilms. Previous studies have indicated that ethanol supplementation during S. aureus biofilm formation results in increased biofilm formation and changes in gene expression. However, the impact of alcohols on preformed S. aureus biofilms has not been studied. In this study, we formed S. aureus biofilms on PVC plastic plates and then treated these preformed biofilms with five different alcohols. We observed that alcohol treatment of preformed S. aureus biofilms led to significant increases in biofilm levels after 24 h of treatment. Many bacteria within these biofilms were found to be alive and metabolically active. Alcohol treatment also resulted in increased transcription of the biofilm-promoting genes icaA and icaD, as well as several antibiotic resistance genes. These results demonstrate that treatment of S. aureus preformed biofilms with alcohols enhances biofilm levels if maintained for extended periods. Thus, alcohols might be of limited usefulness for the eradication of preformed S. aureus biofilms.
