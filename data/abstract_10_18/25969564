BACKGROUND: The reservoir of pathogenic ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli remains unknown. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 80 healthy twins and their mothers to determine the frequency of excretion of ciprofloxacin-resistant, potentially pathogenic E. coli. Stool specimens were cultured selectively for ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacteria. Isolates were categorized on the basis of additional resistance and virulence profiles. We also prospectively collected clinical metadata. RESULTS: Fifteen children (19%) and 8 mothers (20%) excreted ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli at least once. Overall, 33% of 40 families had at least 1 member whose stool specimen yielded ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli on culture. Fifty-seven submitted stool specimens (2.8%) contained such organisms; clones ST131-H30 and ST405 accounted for 52 and 5 of the positive specimens, respectively. Length of hospital stay after birth (P = .002) and maternal colonization (P = .0001) were associated with subsequent childhood carriage of ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli; antibiotic use, acid suppression, sex, mode of delivery, and maternal perinatal antibiotic use were not. Ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli were usually resistant to additional antibiotic classes, and all had virulence genotypes typical of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli. CONCLUSIONS: Healthy children and their mothers commonly harbor ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli with pathogenic potential.
