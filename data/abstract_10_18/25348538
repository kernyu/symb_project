Imported malaria has been a great challenge for public health in China due to decreased locally transmitted cases and frequent exchange worldwide. Plasmodium falciparum has been mainly responsible for the increasing impact. Currently, artesunate plus amodiaquine, one of the artemisinin combination therapies recommended by the World Health Organization, has been mainly used against uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in China. However, drug resistance marker polymorphism in returning migrant workers has not been demonstrated. Here, we have evaluated the prevalence of pfmdr1 and pfcrt polymorphisms, as well as the K13 propeller gene, a molecular marker of artemisinin resistance, in migrant workers returned from Ghana to Shanglin County, Guangxi Province, China, in 2013. A total of 118 blood samples were randomly selected and used for the assay. Mutations of the pfmdr1 gene that covered codons 86, 184, 1034, and 1246 were found in 11 isolates. Mutations at codon N86Y (9.7%) were more frequent than at others, and Y(86)Y(184)S(1034)D(1246) was the most prevalent (63.6%) of the four haplotypes. Mutations of the pfcrt gene that covered codons 74, 75, and 76 were observed in 17 isolates, and M(74)N(75)T(76) was common (70.6%) in three haplotypes. Eight different genotypes of the K13 propeller were first observed in 10 samples in China, 2 synonymous mutations (V487V and A627A) and 6 nonsynonymous mutations. C580Y was the most prevalent (2.7%) in all the samples. The data presented might be helpful for enrichment of molecular surveillance of antimalarial resistance and will be useful for developing and updating antimalarial guidance in China.
