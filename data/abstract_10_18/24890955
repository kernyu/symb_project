In 2010, 15 institutions around Australia conducted a period prevalence study of key resistances in isolates of Enterococcus species associated with a range of clinical disease amongst in- and outpatients. Each institution collected up to 100 consecutive isolates and tested these for susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobials using standardised methods. Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis were characterised by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Multilocus sequence typing was performed on representative pulsotypes of E. faecium. Susceptibility results were compared with similar surveys conducted in 1995, 1999, 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2009. In the 2010 survey, E. faecalis (1,201 isolates) and E. faecium (170 isolates) made up 98.9% of the 1,386 isolates tested. Ampicillin resistance was very common (85.3%) in E. faecium and absent in E. faecalis. Non-susceptibility to vancomycin was 36.5% in E. faecium (similar to the 35.2% in 2009 but up from 15.4% in the 2007 survey) and 0.5% in E. faecalis. There were significant differences in the proportion of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium between the states ranging from 0% in Western Australia to 54.4% in South Australia. The vanB gene was detected in 62 E. faecium and 3 E. faecalis isolates. The vanA gene was detected in 1 E. faecium isolate. All vancomycin-resistant E. faecium belonged to clonal complex 17. The most common sequence type (ST) was ST203, which was found in all regions that had reports of vancomycin resistant enterococci. ST341 was detected only in New South Wales/Australian Capital Territory and ST414 only in South Australia and Victoria. High-level resistance to gentamicin was 34.1% in E. faecalis and 66.1% in E. faecium. A subset of isolates was tested against high-level streptomycin, linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin. High-level streptomycin resistance was found in 8.2% of E. faecalis isolates and 43.8% of E. faecium isolates. Linezolid non-susceptibility was more common in E. faecalis (5.8%) than E. faecium (0.9%). Overall 9.4% of E. faecium were resistant to quinupristin/dalfopristin (E. faecalis is intrinsically resistant).
