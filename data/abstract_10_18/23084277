Emergence of bacterial resistance has eroded the effectiveness of many life saving antibiotics leading to an urgent need for new chemical classes of antibacterial agents. We have applied a Staphylococcus aureus fitness test strategy to natural products screening to meet this challenge. In this paper we report the discovery of kibdelomycin A, a demethylated congener of kibdelomycin, the representative of a novel class of antibiotics produced by a new strain of Kibdelosporangium. Kibdelomycin A is a potent inhibitor of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, inhibits DNA synthesis and shows whole cell antibiotic activity, albeit, less potently than kibdelomycin. Kibdelomycin C-33 acetate and tetrahydro-bisdechloro derivatives of kibdelomycin were prepared which helped define a basic SAR of the family.
