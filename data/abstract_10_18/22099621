Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a prevalent health care problem that may be commonly encountered in patients desiring aesthetic or reconstructive rhinoplasty. The purpose of this article is to review the common bacterial pathogens associated with CRS, as well as patterns of bacterial resistance in this patient subset. Close understanding of microbial pathogens involved in CRS and their associated resistance patterns will guide facial plastic surgeons in optimally managing this important potential comorbidity, and in turn positively influence the outcome of rhinoplasty.
