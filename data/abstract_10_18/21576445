The HIV-1 integrase (IN) mutations Y143C/R are known as raltegravir (RAL) primary resistance mutations. In a previous study (S. Reigadas et al., PLoS One 5:e10311, 2010), we investigated the genetic pathway and the dynamics of emergence of the Y143C/R mutations in three patients failing RAL-containing regimens. In these patients, the Y143C/R mutation was associated with the T97A mutation. The aim of the present biochemical and molecular studies in vitro was to evaluate whether the secondary mutation, T97A, associated with the Y143C/R mutation could increase the level of resistance to RAL and impact IN activities. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments were performed with expression vectors harboring the region of the pol gene coding for IN. With a 3'-end processing assay, the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) were 1.2 muM, 1.2 muM, 2.4 muM (fold change [FC], 2), and 20 muM (FC, 16.7) for IN wild type (WT), the IN T97A mutation, the IN Y143C/T97A mutation, and the IN Y143R/T97A mutation, respectively. FCs of 18 and 100 were observed with the strand transfer assay for IN Y143C/T97A and Y143R/T97A mutations, with IC(50) of 0.625 muM and 2.5 muM, respectively. In the strand transfer assay, the IN Y143C or R mutation combined with the secondary mutation T97A severely impaired susceptibility to RAL compared to results with the IN Y143C or R mutation alone. Assays without RAL suggested that the T97A mutation could rescue the catalytic activity which was impaired by the presence of the Y143C/R mutation. The combination of the T97A mutation with the primary RAL resistance mutations Y143C/R strongly reduces the susceptibility to RAL and rescues the catalytic defect due to the Y143C/R mutation. This result indicates that the emergence of the Y143C/R/T97A double-mutation pattern in patients is a signature of a high resistance level.
