Myocarditis is indicated as the second leading cause of sudden death in young adults. Reovirus induces myocarditis in neonatal mice, providing a tractable model system for investigation of this important disease. Alpha/beta-interferon (IFN-alpha/beta) treatment improves cardiac function and inhibits viral replication in patients with chronic myocarditis, and the host IFN-alpha/beta response is a determinant of reovirus strain-specific differences in induction of myocarditis. Virus-induced IFN-beta stimulates a signaling cascade that establishes an antiviral state and further induces IFN-alpha/beta through an amplification loop. Reovirus strain-specific differences in induction of and sensitivity to IFN-alpha/beta are associated with the viral M1, L2, and S2 genes. The reovirus M1 gene-encoded mu2 protein is a strain-specific repressor of IFN-beta signaling, providing one possible mechanism for the variation in resistance to IFN and induction of myocarditis between different reovirus strains. We report here that mu2 amino acid 208 determines repression of IFN-beta signaling and modulates reovirus induction of IFN-beta in cardiac myocytes. Moreover, mu2 amino acid 208 determines reovirus replication, both in initially infected cardiac myocytes and after viral spread, by regulating the IFN-beta response. Amino acid 208 of mu2 also influences the cytopathic effect in cardiac myocytes after spread. Finally, mu2 amino acid 208 modulates myocarditis in neonatal mice. Thus, repression of IFN-beta signaling mediated by reovirus mu2 amino acid 208 is a determinant of the IFN-beta response, viral replication and damage in cardiac myocytes, and myocarditis. These results demonstrate that a single amino acid difference between viruses can dictate virus strain-specific differences in suppression of the host IFN-beta response and, consequently, damage to the heart.
