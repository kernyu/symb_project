INTRODUCTION: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a syndrome related to Gardnerella vaginalis and is characterized by an imbalance in the vaginal microbiota. This work focused on the evaluation of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and the occurrence of the vaginolysin (vly) gene in G. vaginalis isolated from BV and non-BV patients. METHODOLOGY: The vaginal secretions were collected randomly and processed for G. vaginalis isolation. The isolates were presumptively identified by beta-hemolysis and oxidase and catalase tests. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to confirm bacterial identity and to detect the vly gene. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were determined. RESULTS: Of 89 patients, G. vaginalis was isolated from 42 (37 BV and 5 non-BV), and 204 isolates were selected (179 from BV and 25 non-BV). The vly gene was detected in all G. vaginalis isolated from non-BV women and in 98.3% of the bacteria from BV patients. High resistance was observed for ampicillin (54.4%), metronidazole (59.8%), tinidazole (60.3%) and secnidazole (71.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Further studies are needed to better address the role of G. vaginalis and the vly gene in BV pathogenesis.
