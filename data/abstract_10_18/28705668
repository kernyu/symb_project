The activity of eravacycline was compared with that of anti-Acinetobacter reference antimicrobials against carbapenem non-susceptible Acinetobacter baumannii isolates associated with an acquired OXA or up-regulation of the intrinsic OXA-51-like enzyme. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by broth microdilution of 286 non-duplicate, carbapenem non-susceptible A. baumannii isolates to eravacycline, amikacin colistin, doxycycline, imipenem, levofloxacin, meropenem, minocycline, sulbactam, tigecycline and tobramycin. Eravacycline showed greater activity than the comparators of the tetracycline class, levofloxacin, amikacin, tobramycin and colistin. The eravacycline MIC50/90 values were 0.5/1 mg/L and those for tigecycline, minocycline and doxycycline were 1/2, 4/8 and 32/ >/= 64 mg/L, respectively. In conclusion, eravacycline was the most potent antibiotic of those tested against A. baumannii, including isolates that were resistant to sulbactam, imipenem/meropenem, levofloxacin and amikacin/tobramycin. Eravacycline has the potential to become a useful addition to the limited armamentarium of drugs that can be used to treat this problem pathogen.
