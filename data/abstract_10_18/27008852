Though current functional genomic screening systems are useful for investigating human susceptibility to chemical toxicity, they have limitations. Well-established, high-throughput yeast mutant screens identify only evolutionarily conserved processes. RNA interference can be applied in human cells but is limited by incomplete gene knockout and off-target effects. Human haploid cell screening is advantageous as it requires knockdown of only a single copy of each gene. A human haploid cell mutant library (KBM7-Mu), derived from a chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patient, was recently developed and has been used to identify genes that modulate sensitivity to infectious agents and pharmaceutical drugs. Here, we sought to improve the KBM7-Mu screening process to enable efficient screening of environmental chemicals. We developed a semi-solid medium based screening approach that cultures individual mutant colonies from chemically resistant cells, faster (by 2-3 weeks) and with less labor than the original liquid medium-based approach. As proof of principle, we identified genetic mutants that confer resistance to the carcinogen formaldehyde (FA, 12 genes, 18 hits) and the CML chemotherapeutic agent imatinib (6 genes, 13 hits). Validation experiments conducted on KBM7 mutants lacking each of the 18 genes confirmed resistance of 6 FA mutants (CTC1, FCRLA, GOT1, LPR5, M1AP, and MAP2K5) and 1 imatinib-resistant mutant (LYRM9). Despite the improvements to the method, it remains technically challenging to limit false positive findings. Nonetheless, our findings demonstrate the broad applicability of this optimized haploid approach to screen toxic chemicals to identify novel susceptibility genes and gain insight into potential mechanisms of toxicity.
