Two closely related Enterobacter aerogenes isolates presented a new identical aac(6')-Ib-cr genetic environment, including IS26. One isolate showed lower MICs of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, tobramycin, and amikacin and decreased expression of aac(6')-Ib-cr, which might be related to a 12-bp deletion causing a displacement of the -10 box upstream of the aac(6')-Ib-cr gene.
