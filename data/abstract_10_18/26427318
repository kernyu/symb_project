CONTEXT: Antibacterial resistance has dramatically increased and resulted in serious health problems worldwide. One appealing strategy to overcome this resistance problem is the use of combinations of antibacterial compounds to increase their potency. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to determine the synergistic effects of artocarpin for ampicillin, norfloxacin, and tetracycline against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as well as the Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A broth microdilution method (1.95-250 microg/mL) was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of artocarpin and the antibiotics. Any synergistic effects were evaluated at their own MIC using the checkerboard method and a time-kill assay at 37 degrees C for 24 h. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Artocarpin showed antibacterial activity against MRSA and E. coli with an MIC value of 62.5 microg/mL, and against P. aeruginosa with an MIC value of 250 microg/mL. The interaction of artocarpin with all tested antibiotics produced synergistic effects against MRSA with a fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) of 0.15-0.37. In addition, a combination of artocarpin and norfloxacin showed a synergistic effect against E. coli with an FICI value of 0.37, while the combinations of artocarpin and tetracycline as well as artocarpin and norfloxacin exhibited synergy interactions against P. aeruginosa with FICI values of 0.24 and 0.37, respectively. Time-kill assays indicated that artocarpin enhanced the antimicrobial activities of tetracycline, ampicillin, and norfloxacin against MRSA as well as Gram-negative bacteria.
