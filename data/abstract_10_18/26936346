The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) of luliconazole against Trichophyton rubrum (14 strains) and Trichophyton mentagrophytes (14 strains), which are the most common cause of tinea, were compared with those of 6 topical antifungal drugs of lanoconazole, bifonazole, efinaconazole, liranaftate, naftifine and terbinafine.Luliconazole showed the most potent antifungal activity (MIC90 =0.00098 mug/ml and MFC90 =0.0078 mug/ml) among the compounds tested against the two species. Efinaconazole and bifonazole, the drug of azole-class, showed a large MFC/MIC ratio. On the other hand, these ratios of luliconazole and lanoconazole were as small as those of liranaftate, naftifine and terbinafine which are thought to possess fungicidal mechanism. These results suggest that luliconazole possesses fungicidal activity against both species of Trichophyton.In this study, we found that luliconazole had the most potent antifungal activity among the major topical antimycotics used in Japan and the US. Luliconazole would be the best-in-class drug for dermatophytosis in clinics.
