Staphylococcus aureus causes hundreds of thousands of infections and thousands of deaths per year in the United States. The emergence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), including community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA), has added to the problem. As MRSA continue to evolve, they are becoming resistant to more classes of antibiotics. In the past 20 years, only three new antibiotics have been approved for human use (linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline), and resistance to these three drugs has already emerged. New antibiotics are needed, and we have developed a promising drug candidate that may be applicable to treating MRSA, among other gram-positive bacterial infections. We have identified a novel synthetic drug, coded SK-03-92, that shows broad in vitro efficacy against a variety of gram-positive bacterial strains that include a number of strains of S. aureus. Besides the activity against gram-positive bacteria, this new drug also exhibits activity against Mycobacterium strains.
