This study investigated the effects of exogenous lipase supplementation on the growth performance, intestinal growth and function, immune response and physical barrier function, and related signaling molecules mRNA expression of young grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). A total of 450 grass carp (255.02 +/- 0.34 g) were fed five diets for 60 days. There were 5 dietary treatments that included a normal protein and lipid diet containing 30% crude protein (CP) with 5% ether extract (EE), and the low-protein and high-lipid diets (28% CP, 6% EE) supplemented with graded levels of exogenous lipase supplementation activity at 0, 1193, 2560 and 3730 U/kg diet. The results indicated that compared with a normal protein and lipid diet (30% CP, 5% EE), a low-protein and high-lipid diet (28% CP, 6% EE) (un-supplemented lipase) improved lysozyme activities and complement component 3 contents in the distal intestine (DI), interleukin 10 mRNA expression in the proximal intestine (PI), and glutathione S-transferases activity and glutathione content in the intestine of young grass carp. In addition, in low-protein and high-lipid diets, optimal exogenous lipase supplementation significantly increased acid phosphatase (ACP) activities and complement component 3 (C3) contents (P < 0.05), up-regulated the relative mRNA levels of antimicrobial peptides (liver expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 and hepcidin) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 10 and transforming growth factor beta1) and signaling molecules inhibitor protein-kappaBalpha (IkappaBalpha) and target of rapamycin (TOR) (P < 0.05), down-regulated the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 8, interferon gamma2, and interleukin 1beta), and signaling molecules (nuclear factor kappa B p65, IkappaB kinase beta, IkappaB kinase gamma) (P < 0.05) in the intestine of young grass carp. Moreover, optimal exogenous lipase supplementation significantly decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PC) contents (P < 0.05), improved the activities of anti-superoxide anion (ASA) and anti-hydroxyl radical (AHR), glutathione content, and the activities and mRNA levels of antioxidant enzymes (copper/zinc superoxide dismutase, manganese superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferases and glutathione reductase) (P < 0.05), up-regulated signaling molecule NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) (P < 0.05), down-regulated signaling molecules (Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein 1a, Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein 1b) (P < 0.05) in the intestine of young grass carp. Furthermore, optimal exogenous lipase supplementation significantly elevated the mRNA levels of tight junction proteins (Occludin, zonula occludens 1, Claudin b, Claudin c and Claudin 3) (P < 0.05), down-regulated the mRNA levels of tight junction proteins (Claudin 12 and Claudin 15a) (P < 0.05), down-regulated signaling molecules myosin light chain kinase (P < 0.05) in the intestine of young grass carp. In conclusion, dietary lipid could partially spare protein, and the low-protein and high-lipid diet could improve growth, intestinal growth and function, immune response and antioxidant capability of fish. Meanwhile, in high-fat and low-protein diets, optimal exogenous lipase supplementation improved growth, intestinal growth and function, intestinal immunity, physical barrier, and regulated the mRNA expression of related signal molecules of fish. The optimal level of exogenous lipase supplementation in young grass carp (255-771 g) was estimated to be 1193 U kg(-1) diet.
