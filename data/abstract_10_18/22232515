Given the problem of increasing antimicrobial--especially antibacterial--drug resistance and the paucity of new agents, it is sensible to consider alternative approaches to infection control to aid in conservation. Photoantimicrobials are highly active agents, regardless of the conventional drug resistance status of the intended organism. Their use in infection control, via topical or local treatment protocols, has thus far received far from proper assessment and requires a wider audience.
