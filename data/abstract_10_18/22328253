The invasion of opportunistic pleiomorphic Candida albicans into oral cavity environment leads to development and progression of its resistance to both naturally occurring antifungal peptides in human saliva as well as commercially available antifungal therapies. As a result of this, the usage and popularity of natural medicine and dentifrices had increased significantly in the last decade. In the present investigation, we have assessed the action of locally available dentifrices against C. albicans biofilm. Disk diffusion test showed maximum zone of inhibition (20 mm) by herbal dentifrice (D-5) as compared to other dentifrices when incubated at 37 degrees C and 48 h. Assessment of dentifrice D-5 for its effectiveness against C. albicans was further shown in MIC(90) (3.12 mg mL(-1)) and SMIC(90) (6.2 mg mL(-1)) values for planktonic and sessile cells (biofilm forming), respectively. Our data depicted 80% reduction in the cell surface hydrophobicity when 6.2 mg mL(-1) of herbal dentifrice D-5 was used against 48-h grown Candida biofilm at 37 degrees C. Visualization of herbal dentifrice D-5-treated C. albicans biofilm under SEM revealed drastic reduction in the dense network of yeast, hyphae, and pseudohyphae enclosed in its ECM as compared to its control biofilm. The data were further supported by CLSM analysis which depicted C. albicans architecture disruption by herbal dentifrices. From the above data, it is inferred that these studies would provide researchers and medical practitioners with better insight into the antifungal effect of natural herbal dentifrices.
