There are specific indications in urological procedures [transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB), endoscopic procedures, and all interventions classified as contaminated or dirty] requiring antibiotic prophylaxis. Most postoperative infections are caused by enterococci of the Gram-positive strains and Enterobacteriaceae of the Gram-negative ones. As reported by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), there are increasing numbers of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Most Enterococcus faecium strains are ampicillin-resistant and the Enterobacteriaceae have a high prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers, for which the cephalosporins and penicillins are not drugs of choice. In recent years, there are also increasing numbers of Gram-negative strains that are able to produce carbapenemases and for which the only therapeutic options are gentamicin, tigecycline and colistin. An alternative to these drugs, from a prophylactic point of view, is fosfomycin, an old antibiotic that maintains bactericidal activity against both enterococci and multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. Available in an oral formulation as trometamol salt, fosfomycin reaches high plasma and urine concentrations, and is therefore a possible alternative to other drugs both for therapy and urological prophylaxis.
