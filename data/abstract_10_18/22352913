The neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) affect more than one billion people (one-sixth of the world's population) and occur primarily in undeveloped countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Available drugs for these diseases are decades old and present an important number of limitations, especially high toxicity and, more recently, the emergence of drug resistance. In the last decade several Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) studies have been developed in order to identify new organic compounds with activity against the parasites responsible for these diseases, which are reviewed in this paper. The topics summarized in this work are: 1) QSAR studies to identify new organic compounds actives against Chaga's disease; 2) Development of QSAR studies to discover new antileishmanial drusg; 3) Computational studies to identify new drug-like compounds against human African trypanosomiasis. Each topic include the general characteristics, epidemiology and chemotherapy of the disease as well as the main QSAR approaches to discovery/identification of new actives compounds for the corresponding neglected disease. The last section is devoted to a new approach know as multi-target QSAR models developed for antiparasitic drugs specifically those actives against trypanosomatid parasites. At present, as a result of these QSAR studies several promising compounds, active against these parasites, are been indentify. However, more efforts will be required in the future to develop more selective (specific) useful drugs.
