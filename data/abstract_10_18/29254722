The spread of antimicrobial resistant E. coli within the environment is a global concern. Wildlife such as feral pigs have been identified as a possible reservoir of antimicrobial resistant bacteria. A cross-sectional survey of free-ranging, feral pigs within the Kimberley region of northwestern Australia was conducted to estimate the prevalence of antimicrobial and disinfectant resistant E. coli in this population. Of the 493 faecal samples collected, 115 E. coli isolates were randomly selected and their identity confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Isolates were screened for susceptibility to 14 veterinary antimicrobials (including antimicrobials not permitted for use in Australia) using MIC broth microdilution using Sensititre (BOPO6F) and breakpoints according to CLSI and EUCAST guidelines. Isolates also underwent disinfectant susceptibility testing to six disinfectants at their recommended concentration for use as well as at a twofold dilution, based on methods adapted from the CLSI agar plate dilution method. A moderate prevalence of resistance was observed to sulfadimethoxine (50.4%; 58/115) and florfenicol (27.0%; 31/115). A low prevalence of resistance was estimated to chlortetracycline (5.2%; 6/115) and multi-drug resistance was only identified in 1.7% (2/115) of E.coli isolates tested. Isolates were susceptible to five of the six disinfectants screened. Feral pigs could potentially act as a reservoir of antimicrobial resistance in the environment with possible implications for domestic livestock. The role that feral pigs might play in transmission of antimicrobial resistance requires further investigation, and the occurrence of resistance in such isolated populations needs to be considered when attempting to infer source attribution of antimicrobial resistance in livestock and human populations.
