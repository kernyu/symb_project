Eighteen new hydrazino-1,3-thiazole derivatives were evaluated against 8 strains of multi-resistant Candida spp. Introduction of an indolyl moiety linked to the hydrazone function enhanced the in vitro anti-Candida activity, with an activity spectrum towards Candida albicans strains. Introduction of a (S)-2-aminoethyl chain on the thiazole nucleus largely enhanced the in vitro antifungal activity, with a selectivity oriented towards non-C. albicans species.
