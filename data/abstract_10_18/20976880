Yearly changes in the susceptibility of clinical isolates to ulifloxacin (UFX) and other fluoroquinolones were examined through surveys over 3 periods. In the first survey, 534 strains derived from 19 species were collected from clinical specimens during 6 months from December 2003 to May 2004. In the same way, 805 strains were collected from December 2005 to May 2006 in the second survey, and 863 strains were from December 2007 to May 2008 in the third survey. Over these 3 study periods, the susceptibilities of fluoroquinolones against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were decreased. The isolation frequency of levofloxacin-nonsusceptible strain was increased from 0% to 11.8% and from 14.6% to 20.8%, respectively. MIC90s of UFX against these pathogens were also increased, but its MIC90 for E. coli was 2 to 4 times lower than that of levofloxacin. On the other hand, the susceptibility of strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae to UFX was increased. Among the fluoroquinolones tested, UFX showed the most potent activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and no changes in the MIC90s occurred during the surveillance. Although one strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated in the third study period showed levofloxacin-resistance (MIC, 8 microg/mL), there were nearly no changes in the MIC90s of any agents tested including UFX against S. pneumoniae during the surveillance. As for other bacterial species, a tendency to increase in resistance to UFX was not observed. The activity of UFX against Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. was superior/equal to those of fluoroquinolones tested.
