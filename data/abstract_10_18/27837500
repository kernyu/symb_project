By definition, an antifungal agent is a drug that selectively destroys fungal pathogens with minimal side effects to the host. Despite an increase in the prevalence of fungal infections particularly in immunocompromised patients, only a few classes of antifungal drugs are available for therapy, and they exhibit limited efficacy in the treatment of life-threatening infections. These drugs include polyenes, azoles, echinocandins, and nucleoside analogs. This chapter focuses on the currently available classes and representatives of systemic antifungal drugs in clinical use. We further discuss the unmet clinical needs in the antifungal research field; efforts in reformulation of available drugs such as Amphotericin B nanoparticles for oral drug delivery; development of new agents of known antifungal drug classes, such as albaconazole, SCY-078, and biafungin; and new drugs with novel targets for treatment of invasive fungal infections, including nikkomycin Z, sordarin derivatives, VT-1161 and VT-1129, F901318, VL-2397, and T-2307.
