Protection against bacterial infections is an important research field in modern society. Antimicrobial polymers have received considerable attention as next-generation biocides because they represent an ecologically friendly approach that does not promote resistance. In the last decade, many authors have reported the development of nano-sized antimicrobial polymers with enhanced bactericidal performance by increasing the active-area of biocides. This review presents several suitable methods of synthesis of antimicrobial polymer nanomaterials with various shapes, including a nanosphere and fibrous and tubular structures. We also discuss the antimicrobial mechanisms of these polymers. In addition, antimicrobial polymer thin films, which can inhibit bacterial adhesion, are introduced briefly with examples. Our aim is to present synthetic routes and formation mechanisms of various antimicrobial polymer nanostructures.
