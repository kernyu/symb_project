A series of C10 non-basic building block-substituted, levofloxacin core-based derivatives were synthesized in 43-86% yield. The antibacterial activity of these new fluoroquinolones was evaluated using a standard broth microdilution technique. The quinolone (S)-9-fluoro-10-(4-hydroxypiperidin-1-yl)-3-methyl-7-oxo-3,7-dihydro-2H-[1,4]oxaz ino[2,3,4-ij]quinoline-6-carboxylic acid L-arginine tetrahydrate exhibited superior antibacterial activity against quinolone-susceptible and resistant strains compared with the clinically used fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, penicillin, and vancomycin, especially to the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolates, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae clinical isolates, and Streptococcus pyogenes.
