AIC246 (letermovir) is a potent anticytomegalovirus drug in clinical development. Here, we report a consistent antiviral efficacy of AIC246 against human cytomegalovirus laboratory strains, clinical isolates, and virus variants resistant to approved drugs. Furthermore, we describe a remarkable selectivity of AIC246 for human cytomegaloviruses compared to that of other alpha-, beta-, or gammaherpesviruses or nonrelated pathogenic viruses, including adeno-, hepadna-, retro-, orthomyxo-, and flaviviruses. Our data confirm and support an excellent and selective anticytomegaloviral activity of AIC246.
