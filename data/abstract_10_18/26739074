OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical characteristics of patients with bloodstream Acinetobacter baumannii infection in Intensive Care Unit (ICU). METHODS: Eighty-three ICU patients with bloodstream Acinetobacter baumannii infection from January 2012 to March 2015 were retrospectively analyzed, including infection-related risk factors, drug-resistant bacteria, treatments and prognosis. RESULTS: Among 83 patients, 60 patients (72.29%) were male, 23 (27.71%) were female. The youngest patient was 40 days old, the oldest was 92 years old, the age was (46.23+/-19.22) years old. In total, there were 20 patients (24.10%) with plural bacterial infection in blood, 60 (72.29%) with more than 3 kinds of disorders, 52 patients suffered homologous bacterial infection in blood and other organs. Among these cases, lower respiratory tract had the highest percentage of homologous bacteria (29 cases), followed by catheter (11 cases), wound secretion (8 cases), cerebrospinal fluid (3 cases) and ascites (1 case). The risk factors of bloodstream infection by Acinetobacter baumannii included catheterization, serious primary disease and basic disease, usage of corticosteroids, surgery and invasive operation and so on. Acinetobacter baumannii were highly resistant. Most of them were multi-drug resistance, and some were pan-drug resistance. It showed more than 80% drug resistant rate to antibiotics except sulbactam, cefopcrazone and amikacin. Among 83 patients, 55 cases (66.26%) were dead, 25 cases (30.12%) were improved and 3 cases (3.62%) were cured. CONCLUSION: Acinetobacter baumannii are highly and multidrug-resistant to commonly used antibiotics. Patients in ICU suffering serious basic diseases should be shorten hospitalization time, restricted the use of breathing machine and immunosuppressant. It must carry out disinfection for invasive operation to reduce the risk of bloodstream infections, and the abuse of antibiotics must be avoided to slow bacteria resistance.
