BACKGROUND: Host immune responses during acute HIV-1 infection can influence the viral setpoint, which is a predictor of disease progression. Interferon (IFN)-lambdas are newly classified type III interferons, which use JAK-STAT pathway. Currently, the dynamics of IFN-lambdas related genes and proteins expression in the signaling pathway have not been well elaborated, especially in acute HIV-1-infected patients. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the dynamic changes of IFN-lambdas related genes and proteins in JAK/STAT pathway in acute HIV-1-infected patients, and analyze their correlation with CD4 T cell counts and HIV-1 viral loads. STUDY DESIGN: Real-time PCR and flow cytometry methods were used to evaluate the dynamic changes of IFN-lambdas related genes and proteins in JAK/STAT pathway in both acute and chronic HIV-1-infected patients. RESULTS: The IFN-alpha receptors (R), IFN-gamma R, IFN-lambdas R and STAT1 mRNA and protein levels increased in acute HIV-1-infected patients (p < 0.01), in addition, Mx1 mRNA levels in acute HIV-1-infected patients are higher than those in HIV-negative subjects. IFN-lambdas R and IFN-alpha R mRNA levels are inversely correlated with CD4(+) T-cell counts, but are positively correlated with viral loads. CONCLUSIONS: The dynamic changes of IFNs related genes in JAK-STAT pathway in acute HIV-1 infection will deepen our understanding of the roles of IFN-lambdas in HIV pathogenesis.
