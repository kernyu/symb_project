Treatment of complicated urinary tract infections and complicated intra-abdominal infections is increasingly difficult due to the rising prevalence of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Ceftazidime-avibactam is a combination of the established third-generation cephalosporin ceftazidime with avibactam, a novel non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor, which restores the activity of ceftazidime against many beta-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacteria, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases. Clinical and nonclinical studies supporting the safety and efficacy of ceftazidime-avibactam include microbiological surveillance studies of clinically relevant pathogens, in vivo animal models of infection, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic target attainment analyses, Phase I clinical pharmacology studies, and Phase II/III studies in the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections and complicated urinary tract infections, including patients with ceftazidime-nonsusceptible Gram-negative infections.
