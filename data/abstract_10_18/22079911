To evaluate the risk factors for nosocomial infection (NI) and mortality in a university hospital, 10-year data of burn patients were assessed retrospectively. The study was conducted at Erciyes University's Burn Center during 2000 and 2009. The records of 1190 patients were obtained. Overall, 131 (11%) patients had 206 NIs with an incidence density of 14.7 infections/1000 patient days. Burn wound infection (n = 109, 53%) was the most common NI. High (%TBSA burned) and late excision were found to be the most significant risk factors for the development of NI. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequent causative microorganism. However, the prevalence of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii has increased in recent years with a prevalence of 47% in 2009. The carbapenem resistance of P. aeruginosa has decreased in recent years, whereas that of A. baumannii increased and it had a prevalence of 94% in the last year. Conversely, the most important risk factors for mortality were advanced age, high %TBSA and having an underlying disease. Prevention of NI is an important issue in burn units to reduce mortality rates. Early excision and wound closure are important therapeutic approaches for the prevention of burn wound infection.
