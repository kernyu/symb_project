The advent of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and its combination with anthracycline-containing chemotherapy have contributed in the past 2 decades to optimize the antileukemic efficacy in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), leading to complete remission rates greater than 90%, virtual absence of resistance, and cure rates of nearly 80%. Recently reported studies from large cooperative trials have also shown that more rational delivery of treatment and improved outcomes may derive from the use of risk-adapted protocols. In particular, patients at higher risk of relapse (ie, those presenting with WBC > 10 x 10(9)/L) seem to benefit from treatments that include cytarabine in the ATRA-plus-chemotherapy scheme, whereas patients with standard-risk disease can be successfully managed with less-intensive regimens that contain ATRA and anthracycline-based chemotherapy. After the outstanding results with arsenic trioxide (ATO) in the treatment of APL relapse, several experimental trials have been designed to explore the role of ATO in front-line therapy with the aim not only of minimizing the use of chemotherapy but also to reinforce standard ATRA-plus-chemotherapy regimens and additionally improve therapeutic efficacy. In this review article, we discuss most recent advances in the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed and relapsed APL.
