Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is one of the most important bacterial pathogens causing diarrhea. The resistance of S. typhimurium to antimicrobial agents, which has recently been isolated from patients, is causing serious problems. We investigated the effects of salicylic acid (Sal) and acetyl salicylate (AcSal) on the susceptibility of S. typhimurium to cephalosporin antibiotics, which are known to increase resistance to cephalosporin and quinolone antibiotics. The MIC of cephalosporin antibiotics was higher than that of the media without Sal. The rate of accumulation of ethidium bromide (EtBr) in the bacteria by the outer membrane protein (Omp) was not different from that of the bacteria cultured in the medium containing Sal. However, Carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), an inhibitor of bacterial efflux pumps, significantly reduced the rate of accumulation of EtBr in bacteria cultured on Sal containing medium. In the medium containing CCCP, the MIC of the antimicrobial agent tended to decrease as compared with the control. In addition, the MIC of the bacteria treated with CCCP and Sal was higher than that of the antimicrobial agent against the CCCP treated experimental bacteria. These results suggest that Sal decreases the expression of OmpF in the Omp of S. typhimurium and reduces the permeability of cephalosporin antibiotics to bacteria, which may induce tolerance to cephalosporin antibiotics.
