Clinical pharmacology uses foundational principles of pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) to address medication use spanning a continuum from molecules to the masses. In the realm of infectious diseases, PK/PD attributes are considered especially important, because subtherapeutic dosing of antibiotics has been associated with poorer clinical outcomes in patients and increased incidences of drug resistance in populations. In consideration of these PK/PD principles, we will describe the analogous relationship between health systems strengthening, including for educating healthcare providers about emerging infections, and the tenets of therapeutic drug monitoring.
