BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to analyze the mortality and predictors of 30-day mortality among hospitalized patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa urinary tract infection (PAUTI) and the impact of antibiotic treatment on survival. METHODS: Patients admitted to our hospital with PAUTI or those diagnosed of PAUTI during hospitalization for other disease between September 2012 and September 2014 were included. Repeated episodes from the same patient were excluded. Database with demographic, clinical and laboratory items was created. Empirical and definitive antibiotic therapy, antimicrobial resistance and all-cause mortality at 30 and 90 days were included. RESULTS: 62 patients were included, with a mean age of 75 years. 51% were male. Mortality was 17.7% at 30 days and 33.9% at 90 days. Factors associated with reduced survival at 30 days were chronic liver disease with portal hypertension (P<0,01), diabetes mellitus (P = 0,04) chronic renal failure (P = 0,02), severe sepsis or septic shock (P<0,01), Charlson index > 3 (P = 0.02) and inadequated definitive antibiotic treatment (P<0,01). Independent risk factors for mortality in multivariate analysis were advanced chronic liver disease (HR 77,4; P<0,01), diabetes mellitus (HR 3,6; P = 0,04), chronic renal failure (HR 4,1; P = 0,03) and inadequated definitive antimicrobial treatment (HR 6,8; P = 0,01). CONCLUSIONS: PAUTI are associated with high mortality in hospitalized patients, which increases significantly in those with severe comorbidity such as chronic renal failure, advanced liver disease or diabetes mellitus. Inadequated antibiotic treatment is associated with poor outcome, which remarks the importance of adjusting empirical antibiotic treatment based on the microbiological susceptibility results.
