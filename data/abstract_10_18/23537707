This study evaluates the role of scavenger receptor class A member 3 (SCARA3) in multiple myeloma (MM). SCARA3 expression was induced upon treatment with oxidative stressors (ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs). An epigenetic inactivation of SCARA3 was noted in MM.1S myeloma cells. Myeloma cell killing by dexamethasone and bortezomib was inhibited by up-regulation of SCARA3 while SCARA3 knockdown sensitized myeloma cells to the drugs. Clinical samples showed an inverse correlation between SCARA3 gene expression, myeloma progression, and favorable clinical prognosis. In MM, SCARA3 protects against oxidative stress-induced cell killing and can serve as predictor of MM progression and therapeutic response.
