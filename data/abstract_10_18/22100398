Cyathostomins are the primary parasitic pathogens of equids. For over 40 years, these nematodes have been controlled using broad spectrum anthelmintics. Three classes of anthelmintic are currently available for this use but, unfortunately, resistance to each of these has now been recorded in cyathostomin populations. As part of an optimal strategy to control cyathostomin infections in the field, it will be important to identify drug-resistant worms at as early a stage as possible. This objective needs to be supported by methodologies that will allow the accurate comparison of anthelmintic resistance in different nematode populations. At present, the faecal egg count reduction test is considered the most suitable method for initial screening for anthelmintic resistance in equine nematode populations. However, in its current state, this test lacks sensitivity. It is also costly and time-consuming to perform. Laboratory-based techniques, such as the egg hatch assay, larval development assay, larval migration inhibition assay and the larval feeding inhibition assay offer alternative options for assessing anthelmintic resistance in nematode populations. All of these tests have been investigated for their utility in measuring drug resistance in sheep nematode populations and some have proven useful. The egg hatch assay, larval development assay and larval migration inhibition assay have been investigated for use in measuring levels of drug resistance in equine nematode populations. However, at best, the results obtained thus far indicate that these tests require further refinement.
