Foodborne pathogens are leading causes of illness especially in developing countries. The current study aimed to characterize virulence-associated genes and antimicrobial resistance in 30 Salmonella Typhimurium isolates of chicken and human origin at Mansoura, Egypt. The results showed that invA, avrA, mgtC, stn, and bcfC genes were identified in all the examined isolates, while 96.7% and 6.7% were positive for sopB and pef genes, respectively. The highest resistance frequencies of the isolates were to chloramphenicol and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (73.3%, each), followed by streptomycin (56.7%), tetracycline and ampicillin (53.3%, each), and gentamicin (30%). However, only 2.7% of the isolates were resistant to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone each. Different resistance-associated genes, including blaTEM, aadB, aadC, aadA1, aadA2, floR, tetA(A), tetA(B), and sul1, were identified in Salmonella Typhimurium isolates with the respective frequencies of 53.3%, 6.7%, 23.3%, 46.7%, 63.3%, 73.3%, 60%, 20%, and 96.7%. None of the isolates was positive for blaSHV, blaOXA, and blaCMY genes. The results showed that the intI1 gene was detected in 24 (80%) of the examined Salmonella Typhimurium isolates. Class 1 integrons were found in 19 (79.2%) isolates that were intI1 positive. Seven integron profiles (namely: P-I to P-VII) were identified with P-V (gene cassette dfrA15, aadA2), the most prevalent profile. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to characterize the unusual gene cassette array dfrA12-OrfF-aadA27 from Salmonella Typhimurium isolates in Egypt.
