Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a highly contagious pathogen that infects mainly ciliated cells of respiratory epithelium and type 1 pneumocytes in the alveoli frequently causing serious respiratory disease in infants, elderly, and immunocompromised patients. At present, prevention/treatment of RSV infection is limited to the use of specific anti-RSV antibody or an aerosol formulation of ribavirin, a drug of suboptimal efficacy and low safety profile. There is an urgent need for development of novel anti-RSV drugs and virucides. Here we describe the cell culture-based methods used in our laboratory in identification of novel inhibitors of RSV including the P13 fusion inhibitor, and the PG545 virucide. Protocols for antiviral screening, evaluation of anti-RSV potency, and elucidation of mode of antiviral activity of test compounds are described.
