OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the effects of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) on autophagy, apoptosis and chemoresistance of human small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. RESULTS: The expressions of ERS-related proteins (PEAK, eIF2alpha and CHOP) up-regulated, autophagy-related proteins (LC3, LC3-II and Beclin1) and apoptosis-related proteins (Bax and procaspase-3) down-regulated in NCI-H446 and H69 cells after tunicamycin treatment for 24 h. Compared with the blank group, the tunicamycin, BEZ235 and tunicamycin + BEZ235 groups exhibited decreased expressions of p-PI3K, p-AKT and p-mTOR, and increased expressions of autophagy-related proteins (LC3, LC3-II and Beclin1) and apoptosis proteins (Bax and procaspase-3), and the most obvious changes were observed in the tunicamycin + BEZ235 group. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CCK-8 assay was applied to select the best cell line from five SCLC cell lines (NCI-H446, H69, H526, H146 and H209). Finally, NCI-H446 and H69 cells were selected for further experiments. NCI-H446/CDDP and H69/CDDP were selected and divided into the blank group, tunicamycin (an ESR inducer) group, BEZ235 (inhibitors of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway) group and tunicamycin + BEZ235 group. Cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. Autophagy was observed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Western blotting was used to detect the expressions of ERS-related proteins, autophagy-related proteins, apoptosis-related proteins and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway-related proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide evidence that the activation of ERS could promote autophagy and apoptosis and reverse chemoresistance of human SCLC cells by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.
