Safe and effective antimalarial drugs are required for the treatment of pregnant women. We report a 3-day regimen of artesunate (4 mg/kg/day)-azithromycin (25 mg/kg/day) (ASAZ) to be efficacious (polymerase chain reaction-corrected cure rate of 96.7%) and well tolerated in the treatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in children (N = 11) and adults (N = 19), in Vietnam in 2010. In comparison, the cure rate for artesunate (4 mg/kg on day 0, 2 mg/kg on days 1-6) was 90.0% in children (N = 7) and adults (N = 23). Because azithromycin is considered safe in pregnancy, our findings provide further evidence that ASAZ should be evaluated for the treatment of pregnant women with malaria.
