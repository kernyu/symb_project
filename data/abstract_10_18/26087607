Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) comprise a heterogeneous group of rare malignancies from mesenchymal tissues. The biology of STS causes high aggressiveness, poor prognosis due to early development of distant metastases and limited chemotherapeutic options due to tumor resistance. The paper considers the current principles of chemotherapy for early and metastatic disease. Results of own experience of advanced STS patients' treatment are presented and discussed.
