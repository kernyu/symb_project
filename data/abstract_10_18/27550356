Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole alone and combined with colistin was tested in vitro against six carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) clinical strains. After 24 h, at achievable serum concentrations, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole effectively killed all strains, while colistin killed only one strain. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus colistin rapidly killed all strains after 6 h and for up to 24 h. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, one of the few remaining antimicrobials that still has a degree of activity, particularly combined with colistin, might represent an effective therapy for severe CRAB infections.
