Emergence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB over the past decade presents an unprecedented public health challenge to which countries of concern are responding far too slowly. Global Tuberculosis Report 2014 marks the 20th anniversary of the Global Project on Anti-Tuberculosis Drug Resistance Surveillance, indicating the highest global level of drug-resistance ever recorded detection of 97 000 patients with MDR-TB resulting in 170 000 deaths in 2013. Treatment of MDR-TB is expensive, complex, prolonged (18-24 months) and associated with a higher incidence of adverse events. In this context, nanocarrier delivery systems (NDSs) efficiently encapsulating considerable amounts of second-line anti tubercular drugs ((s)ATDs), eliciting controlled, sustained and more profound effect to trounce the need to administer (s)ATDs at high and frequent doses, would assist in improving patient compliance and avoid hepatotoxicity and/or nephrotoxicity/ocular toxicity/ototoxicity associated with the prevalent (s)ATDs. Besides, NDSs are also known to inhibit the P-glycoprotein efflux, reduce metabolism by gut cytochrome P-450 enzymes and circumnavigate the hepatic first-pass effect, facilitating absorption of drugs via intestinal lymphatic pathways. This review first provides a holistic account on MDR-TB and discusses the molecular basis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistance to anti-tubercular drugs. It also provides an updated bird's eye view on current treatment strategies and laboratory diagnostic test for MDR-TB. Furthermore, a relatively pithy view on patent studies on second-line chemotherapy using NDSs will be discussed.
