Treatment efficacy ofDAAs is limited in the presence of HCV mutants which revealed amino-acids substitution and drug resistance. Because of the high genetic heterogeneity of HCV and its rapid replication, monotherapy with DAA agents poses a high risk for selection of resistant variants. We review the factors that determine resistance, the methods of resistance detection and strategies to avoid the selection of resistant variants.
