Despite recent advances in diagnostics and treatments, infective endocarditis is still associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Even prolonged courses of broad-spectrum antimicrobials often fail to eradicate the infection, making surgical intervention necessary in many cases. In this review, we present recent advances in molecular microbiology techniques that have uncovered a plausible explanation for this resistance to treatment: the recently discovered social behavior of some microbes, in which colonies form a nearly impenetrable barrier around themselves called a biofilm. These biofilm structures isolate the colony from the bodys immune response and antimicrobial drugs. We also present current thinking about possible ways biofilms can be destroyed.
