As one of its primary physiological functions, sPLA(2)-IIA appears to act as an antibacterial agent. In particular, sPLA(2)-IIA shows high activity towards Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). This antibacterial activity results from the preference of the enzyme towards membranes enriched in anionic lipids, which is a common feature of bacterial membranes. An intriguing aspect observed in a variety of bacterial membranes is the presence of a broad but cooperative lipid chain melting event where the lipids in the membrane transition from a solid-ordered (so) into a liquid-disordered (ld) state close to physiological temperatures. It is known that the enzyme is sensitive to the level of lipid packing, which changes sharply between the so and the ld states. Therefore, it would be expected that the enzyme activity is regulated by the bacterial membrane thermotropic behavior. We determine by FTIR the thermotropic lipid chain melting behavior of S. aureus and find that the activity of sPLA(2)-IIA drops sharply in the so state. The activity of the enzyme is also evaluated in terms of its effects on cell viability, showing that cell survival increases when the bacterial membrane is in the so state during enzyme exposure. These results point to a mechanism by which bacteria can develop increased resistance towards antibacterial agents that act on the membrane through a cooperative increase in the order of the lipid chains. These results show that the physical behavior of the bacterial membrane can play an important role in regulating physiological function in an in vivo system.
