This review discusses recent progress in the development of anti-HIV agents, with emphasis on small molecule HIV-1 entry inhibitors. The entry inhibitors primarily target HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins or the cellular receptors, CD4 and chemokine receptors. Two of the entry inhibitors, enfuvirtide and maraviroc, have been approved by the US FDA for AIDS therapy. The drug resistance associated with some of the entry inhibitors will also be discussed.
