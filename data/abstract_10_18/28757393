Schistosomiasis is a remarkable public health problem in developing countries. Presently, praziquantel is the optional drug for all human schistosomiasis. Owing to the increased praziquantel resistance, there is an urgent need to develop new alternatives. This study aims at determining the anti-schistosomal and/or the hepatoprotective effects of the anti-inflammatory drug; vinpocetine, and the vasodilator and the nitric oxide donor; isosorbide-5-mononitrate, in comparison to praziquantel. In the present research, the therapeutic efficacies of these drugs were assessed in Swiss albino female mice (CD-I strain) experimentally infected with an Egyptian strain of Schistosoma mansoni, using some general, parasitological, and histopathological parameters. In this work, praziquantel significantly reduced worm burden and hepatic egg load, increased the percentage of dead eggs in the small intestine and decreased granuloma count, but did not reduce granuloma diameter. While, either vinpocetine or isosorbide-5-mononitrate monotherapy did not induce significant reduction in the worm count, hepatic egg load or shift in the oogram pattern, but significantly reduced granuloma count and diameter. Moreover, isosorbide-5-mononitrate significantly reduced hepatic inflammation and necrosis. The best results were obtained in the mice groups treated with isosorbide-5-mononitrate combined with praziquantel or vinpocetine. Our results point to vinpocetine and isosorbide-5-mononitrate as a convenient and promising adjuvant to praziquantel for ameliorating schistosomal liver pathology. Further studies are recommended to reveal the actual pathways responsible for the different activities of vinpocetine and isosorbide-5-mononitrate.
