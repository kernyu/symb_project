AIMS: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the diversity of the genes encoding aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (AMEs) and their associations with resistance phenotypes and clonality in Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. METHODS: Seventy six P. aeruginosa and 75 A. baumannii isolates were collected from three University affiliated hospitals in Tehran. MIC determination of amikacin and gentamicin as well as the disk diffusion method for tobramycin, netilmicin, and kanamycin were carried out. Nine AMEs genes and three RNA methylases were investigated in all isolates using the PCR method. Clonality for A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa was investigated using repetitive extragenic palindromic and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus PCR, respectively. RESULTS: aph(3')-VIa (90.6%) and aph(3')-IIb (61.8%) were the most prevalent AME genes in A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa, respectively. Eight (26%) amikacin highly resistant A. baumannii isolates were positive for armA methylase. Phenotypes and clonality did not link to the genetic determinants of resistance to aminoglycosides in our isolates. CONCLUSIONS: AMEs genes are disseminated in different clones of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa isolates in Iran. Other than AMEs, there are more complex and multifactorial mechanisms that result in aminoglycoside-resistant phenotypes.
