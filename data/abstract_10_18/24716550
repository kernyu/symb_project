The treatment of bacterial infection is one of the most challenging tasks in the biomedical field. Antibiotics were developed over 70 years and are regarded as the most efficient type of drug to treat bacterial infection. However, there is a concern that the overuse of antibiotics can lead to a growing number of multidrug-resistant bacteria. The development of antibiotic delivery systems to improve the biodistribution and bioavailability of antibiotics is a practical strategy for reducing the generation of antibiotic resistance and increasing the lifespan of newly developed antibiotics. Here we present an antibiotic delivery system (Van subsetSGNPs@RBC) based on core-shell supramolecular gelatin nanoparticles (SGNPs) for adaptive and "on-demand" antibiotic delivery. The core composed of cross-linked SGNPs allows for bacterial infection-microenvironment responsive release of antibiotics. The shell coated with uniform red blood cell membranes executes the function of disguise for reducing the clearance by the immune system during the antibiotic delivery, as well as absorbs the bacterial exotoxin to relieve symptoms caused by bacterial infection. This approach demonstrates an innovative and biomimetic antibiotic delivery system for the treatment of bacterial infection with a minimum dose of antibiotics.
