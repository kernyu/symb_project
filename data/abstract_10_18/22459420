Physical conditioners, often known as skeleton builders, are commonly used to improve the dewaterability of sewage sludge. This study evaluated a novel joint usage of Fenton's reagent and skeleton builders, referred to as the F-S inorganic composite conditioner, focusing on their efficacies and the optimization of the major operational parameters. The results demonstrate that the F-S composite conditioner for conditioning sewage sludge is a viable alternative to conventional organic polymers, especially when ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and lime are used as the skeleton builders. Experimental investigations confirmed that Fenton reaction required sufficient time (80 min in this study) to degrade organics in the sludge. The optimal condition of this process was at pH=5, Fe(2+)=40 mg g(-1) (dry solids), H(2)O(2)=32 mg g(-1), OPC=300 mg g(-1) and lime=400 mg g(-1), in which the specific resistance to filtration reduction efficiency of 95% was achieved.
