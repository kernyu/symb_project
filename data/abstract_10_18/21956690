Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) treatment for HIV has changed the course of AIDS in societies in which the drugs are readily available. Despite the great success of HAART, drug resistance and toxicity issues still remain a concern for some individuals. Thus, a number of investigators have been exploring other approaches for inhibiting HIV-1 replication. One of the most potent of these is the use of RNA interference (RNAi). This review will focus solely on the use of RNAi for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, including the problems, progress and future prospects.
