A total of 559 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates were investigated for heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (hVISA) by population analysis profile area under the curve. Our results suggested that the incidence of hVISA increased rapidly when vancomycin MIC shifted from 1 to 2 mug/mL, and at vancomycin MIC of 2 mug/mL, the incidence of hVISA was nearly 40%.
